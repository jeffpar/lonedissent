ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A. HIRSHOWITZ, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT

7

MR. HIRSHOWITZ:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and rnay it please

the Court.
9
This is an appeal from a decision of the Three-Judge
10
Court in the Eastern District.
11
12

13
14
15
16
17

before.

This case has been up here

At that time, it was under the name of Zwickler

against Koota and since that time Mr. Koota has become a Judge
of the State Supreme Court and Mr. Golden became Acting
District Attorney and we substituted his name.
Beginning January 1, a newly elected District Attorney,
Eugene Gold has become District Attorney.
Now when this Court remanded the case to the Dis­

18

trict Court, it did that with the caution that the Court

19

should first determine whether there was a substantial con­

20

troversy between the parties having adverse legal interests of

21
22

23
24
25

sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of
declaratory judgment.
We submit that Judge Rosling and his associates mis­
understood Judge Brennan because Judge Rosling said in his
opinion "Don't forget this case was started in 1965."
2

1
2

S

It came here in '67 and came back to Judge Rosling
in '68.

At that time as Justice Brennan pointed out in his

opinion, the target of Mr. Zwick'ler had become a Supreme Court
Judge and it appeared that this was Zwickler's only target.
At any rate Judqe Rosling dismissed the whole thing
with this statement:

We see no reason to question Zwickler's

6
assertion — which was in the complaint — that the challenged
7
statute currently impinges upon hit: freedom of speech by
8
O
10

deterring him from again distributing handbills, his own
interest as well as that of others.
And bear in mind that this is not a class action but

11

Judge Rosling imported a class act;on into the action — who

12

would, with like anonymity, practice

13

-environment persuade us in a justice of this plea.

14

free speech in a political

And it is our submission that the record that Judge

15

Rosling had at the time he made the decision that is being

16

appealed from did not have the sufficient immediacy and reality

17

that was referred to in the opinion of this court in the

18

original appeal.

19

In addition to that, the Three-Judqe Court granted

20

an injunction, and you will see in the opinion the granting

21

of the injunction consists of about two sentences.

22

This again was not following the opinion of this

23

court written by Justice Brennan because Justice Brennan

24

referred to Douqlas against Jeannette in the opinion and I

25

might cite the U. S. against Raines there in which the Court
3

1

;2

said there are rigid rules for an injunction»

There is nothing

like that in this case»
On the contrary, the complaint says that District

3
4

Attorney Koota is a very faithful person, very faithful

5

officer, and there is no reason why an injunction was granted

6

by the Court.
Now the reason I bring this up at the outset is that

7
8
9
10

11
1.2

13

some of the judges in the Southern and Eastern Districts have
become confused by the opinion in the Zwickler case; and this
opinion, and when we appear before them as I did lcist week,
we had to do quite a bit of explaining as to what our conceptior
was of whenyyou get declaratory judgment, when you are entitled
to an injunction.
They took it from Judge Rosling's opinion which was

14
15
16
17
18

supposed to be an explanation of this Court's opinion that you
are entitled to a declaratory judgement and an injunction when
you bring a free speech case before the court regardless of
whether there is a controversy at all.
I think you will find that as Judge Rosling goes

19

20

along in his opinion, this is about the size of his conception
of the status of the matter.

21

Now, of course, the Three-Judge Court went ahead and
22
held the statute unconstitutional as a violation of the First
23

Amendment.

In doing that. Judge Rosling in his opinion knocked

24
down the whole statute.
25
4

1

To refresh your recollection as to the statute, this

2

is a statute which was originally passed in 1941 and at that

3

time provided in New York that if you issued political litera­

4

ture involving candidates in an election, you had to put the

S

name and address of the printer or the name and address of the

6

distributor.

1

In 1962, the statute was changed substantially to

8

provide the name and address of the printer and the name and

9

address of the distributor.

10

Judge Rosling in his opinion knocked down the whole

11

statute without any discussion of the question whether the

12

requirement which originally was imposed of name and address

13

of the printer or the distributor would meet his conception

14

of the First Amendment.

15
16

Q

Mr. Hirshowitz, is this the only New York

statute that bears on that subject?

17

A

No, there are 37.

18

Q

Hear ray question.

Is this the only New York

19

statute which requires on political advertisements some informa­

20

tion as to who paid for it or who distributed it and the like?
A

Yes, sir.

22

Q

This is the only

23

A

Yes, sir.

21

24
25

one?

There are municipalordinances in New York City with
reference to the distribution of handbills and so forth but
5

1

only in a commercial atmosphere»

2
3

Q

You started to say something about 37»

Were

you going to say 37 States?

4

A

I thought you were asking, at the time we

5

argued this originally I said that there were 36 other states

©

and the E’ederal Government that had similar statutes»

7

find there are 37 States.

8

Indiana.

I now

I forgot to include the State of

9

Judge Rosling in his opinion failed to, in any way,

!G

refer to the fact that the Federal statute had been upheld by

11

a brother District Court in U. S. against Scott.

12

that by and he failed to refer to the significant difference

13

between New York statutes and every other statute that I know

14

of.
New York requires that the distribution must be in

15

16
17
18

19

quantity, whereas the Federal statute or any of the other State
statutes would be violated if you distributed one piece of
the campaign literature or in the Federal statute, if you
mailed one piece of the literature.,
Where in New York it muse be in quantities so as to

20
21

22

indicate that this is a distribution on a wide-spread scale
and not an isolated distribution.
In addition to that. Judge Roslinq and my associate

23
24
25

He passed

here, the Amicus referred to another aspect which is not before
the court.

As I understand constitutional law, you discuss a

1
2

statute only in the respect in which the plaintiff is involved»

3

The plaintiff here alleged in his complaint that he wanted to

4

distribute literature about a candidate and he said because

5

of the statute, I am prohibited from doing that»

!

You will

-

G

find Judge Rosling, my associate and the Amicus trying to take

7

the statute apart by pointing out that in addition to the
.

8

candidate, the statute also provides or contains the require­

9

ment that you have the name and address of the printer and

10

distributor if you are dealing with propositions»
Now that is not before the Court»

1!

IX

complaint.

13

my friend here and also by Amicus.

It was imported by the Judge that seized upon by

Q

14

It is not in the

Mr. Hirshowitz, if is in the statute, that is

15

to say the statute does relate not only to candidates for

16

political office but also to any pamphlet or comment about a

17

proposition or amendment to the State Constitution.

'18

right?

19

A

Is that

Yes, which is involved in an election.

But I

20

was trying to point out Zwickler, the appellee here, does not

21

say in here that he has any interest in the distribution of

22

matter concerning propositions.

23
24

25

He says I want to give out handbills here concerning
candidates.

That is the setting in which the case came

before the court.
7

?

Q

You figure it makes a difference?

2

A

It actually doesnst make any difference there

3

but they do try to spin out an argument, trying to bring the

4

First Amendment in on the theory that when you are dealing

5

with propositions, you are already dealing with content and

6

consequently it comes closer to a violation of the First

7

Amendment„

3
0

Now it is our position, three things:

In the first

place, the statute has adequate legal history in New York State

10

and throughout the country to justify the type of legislation,

11

secondly, that there is no halo about anonymity and thirdly

12

that in New York State as well as I believe throughout the

13

country and in the Federal, there is no reprisal at present

14

if you forsake anonymity.

t:5

As I said, the New York statute is a result in 1941,

16

as you see in our brief of a Federal investigation by a Grand

17

Jury impaneled by the then Attorney General Jackson that

18

resulted in the report which recommended various changes in

10

the Corrupt Practices Act.

20

At the same time, Senator Gillette of Iowa was

2f

interested in the same subject and he came up with a report,

22

with a speech on the Floor of the Senate, and these two ideas

23

geminating from two different sources resulted in three years,

24

in 1944, in Federal legislation which as I said was upheld in

25

U.S. against Scott.
8

Now, New York and the other States in the Union

1
2

adopted and followed the recommendations of the Federal people

3

at that time and the New York statute is a duplicate of the

4

Federal statute except that it did not at that time go as far

5

as the Federal statute.
The Federal statute says that anyone who distributes

S
7

must have a name and address.

8

time in 1941, of the printer or the distributor.

9

extent, we were not as complete in the legislation as the

We gave the alternative at that
To that

Federal and as I believe most of the other States are.

10

It was in 1962, that as a result of occurrences which

II

are described in our brief and a special investigation that it

12

was decided by the Legislature thar. the statute should be

13

extended and expanded to be substantially a duplicate of the

14

Federal statute except in the respect as I said that it still

15

insists on quantity.

1®

At that time, there was no voice raised in opposition

17

to this expansion of statute as well as in 1941.

18

All the

political parties, the Civil Rights Committee, the City Bar

19

Association, the Criminal Courts Committee, they all wrote

20

letters in support, the Citizens Union which is a very forward

21

organization in New York City wrote letters in support of this

£.£»

legislation.

23

There was no opposition, by the American Jewish

Congress which is in Amicus here or by anybody else.

24

The only opposition put in was by the Socialist Labor

25
I
I

9

1

Party.

2

statute passed almost unanimously.

3

Other than that there xvas no other opposition and the

The 1S41 legislative history combined with the 1962

4

legislative history indicate that the purpose of this legis­

S

lation is? one? the Corrupt Practices Act; two? to brand

6

scurrilous literature; and? three? make the voter aware of who

7

the identity of who is circulating handbills or other litera­

8

ture with respect, to a candidate is.
My adversary here would like to limit.

9

He says in

10

his brief on page 4? *1 ara going to limit ray discussion only

11

to the question of the statute8s purpose to inhibit scurrilous

12

and fraudulent literature?'5 or something like that.
This is not correct as Judge Rosling himself was

13
14

persuaded there.

If that were true, if it were true as my

IS

adversary says? we would have had a case of abstention.

16

wouldn’t have been sent back because at the original hearing

17

before the Judge? the argument was being made that if the

18

purpose was scurrilous or fraudulent pamphlets? that would have

19

to be read into the statute because it is not in the statute.

20

And that would have to be done by a New York Court.
And maybe that is what persuaded the Court originally

2!
22

to abstain.

23

this Court? that is only one of the purposes of the State

24

25

We

But the fact of the matter is? as we argued before

statute.
Q

Am X wrong? wasn’t there in connection with the
10

f

last argument a suggestion or an agreement, wasn't it agreed?

£

I have forgotten now.

3

A

Mo, it wasn't.

4

Q

Wasn't it agreed that this statute was not sub­

5

ject to any limiting construction?

©

treated it when it was last here and wasn’t that because both

7

of you told us that was true?

8
a

A

I told you that.

Isn't that the way we

I can't speak for my adversary.

I told you that as we viewed the statute it had these purposes
I think I said that

10

and there was no vagueness about it there.

It

the Court used the language of abstention when it should have

12

gone into the question of equity jurisdiction there.

13

As you will see from our brief there, I don't want to

14

belabor the point, but the fact of the matter is that all of

15

the considerations which I have referred to are in the legis­

16

lative history.

17

You have the Grand Jury and the Federal Attorney

IS

General or Special Assistant Attorney General Milligan referring

10

to the fact that you need this remedy because of1 the Corrupt

20

Practices inasmuch as the circulation of a anonymous literature

£1

by any political group without the printing of the identity,

22

name and address, would be a vehicle.

23

a vehicle for the evasion of the Corrupt Prcicfcices Act.

24
25

And they found it was

And that history you will find is in the jacket of
the New York bill as adopted in 1941.
11

That is where I acquiredj
1

.

the information.
In 1962f the expansion did not divorce the statute
from its original legislative history,,

To further emphasize

that fact, whan New York revised the Penal Law in 1965, which
Justice Brennan referred to in his opinion, effective
September 1, 1967, it took the original section which was in a
penal law and put it in the Corrupt Practices section of the
Election Law as one of the sections detailing corrupt practices.
Judge Rosling, you will find in this opinion dis­
cusses that as a recognition of that fact.
Q

Could I ask you a question?

In view of the possible impact of this decision on
the Federal statutes, have you had any communication with the
Solicitor General’s Office on the subject?

A

I did, Justice Harlan.

When this case was in a

cert state I communicated with the Solicitor General and he
wrote me back and said that he — and called his attention to
the fact that it would have an impact on the Federal statute.
He wrote me back and said he agreed that it would have
an impact on the Federal statute.

When this Court took the

appeal I advised him of that fact and after soma consideration
he wrote me and said that they had given a lot of thought to
it, but he had decided not to disagree.
Q

Not to disagree, right.

Q

The Federal statutes are narrower, aren't they,
12

1

than the Hew York statute in the respect that none of the

2

Federal statutes goes beyond pamphlets, et cetera, addressed

3

to political candidates»

4

Am I correct in that?

5

A

i
I don’t know.

They are only narrower in the

G

sense that they talk about the President, Vice President,

7

the electors and members of Congress»
Q

8
9

They don’t relate to issues such as the propo­

sition to constitutional debate?

10

A

Ho.

11

Q

Constitutional amen riment»

12

A

Ko.

As I pointed oat in the brief in this case

|

13

here, the campaigning literature that this gentleman distributed'

14

if it had been mailed out would have been a violation of the

'13

10

Federal statute because it concerned a member of Congress, a
category within the Federal statute.
There is no question that there is no risk attached

17
10

anymore.

In the brief there is a historical pilgrimage into

19

history about anonymous literature which is very interesting

20

but none of it would come within the statute here.

21

22
23
24
25

And if it

is made to make the point that there is some virtue in
anonymity, it talks of an era which is long since past in this
country.
There is no virtue any more in anonymity.

I read

the Columbia College Magazine just on the way to this Court

13

n

here and they have an article there where a student in the

2

Columbia College gives his name, rank and serial number, says

3

that the organization SDS said, we are in favor of sedition.

4

We want to overthrow the country.

5

There is frightness in society.

There is no virtue

6

in anonymity.

7

decisions in New York Times ©gainst Sullivan and a number of

8

other cases which New York State has followed with expansive

0

zeal, because in at least two cases that I cite in our brief,

10

New York even goes further and it says if you are the partner

Ili

of a candidate running for office, then you are also that

12

public figure that is not entitled to be protected against

13

libel.

14

Let me say further that this Court by its

Finally in this connection as a clincher, when the

!5

New York penal law was revised which I refer to, they eliminatec

16

from the law criminal libel so that both on the civil

17

on the criminal end, there is almost no risk in any statement

18

that a person makes in a handbill or a circular.

19

end and

So that the alleged detriment that Mr. Swickier

20

would suffer, if he put his name or the name of his organizatior

21

on the circular with respect to Mr. Multer, the then candidate

22

for Congres, is really nonexistent today if it was existent

23

at the time he handed out the circular in 1964.

24

0

Are you going to distinguish the Talley?

25

A

Yes, I am going to talk about Talley.
14

In the first place, in Talley, our statute would be

1

2

substantially satisfied by the fact that existed in Talley

3

because there you had the name of the committee and you had the

4

address of the committee.
I think Committee for Mobilisation or something like

5
G

1
0

that.

11
12

or principal exponents of this organization.
This is absolutely missing from the New York statute.
You give either the name and address of the distributor or
the name and address of the organization.

15
1G

That is all that is

required under New York statutes.
There is no effort to pry into anybody's privacy

13
14

What they were

looking for in Talley was the principals, the name, offices

9
10

You had the address of the committee.

here.

It is just an identification requirement and I think

the electorate of New York City and State are entitled to that
information.
Q

In the Talley case -You mean if it had been something like Committee

17
18
19

20
21

to Defeat Multer, 415 Broadway, that would have satisfied it?
A

Yes, that would have been enough.

You didn’t

have to put down John Smith, President, nothing like that.
That would satisfy the statute.
Because as I said the purpose is not to hurt anybody

22
but if you read the circular, and if it is sent out by, say,
23

the Citizens Union to take an example, you would read that in
24

one light and if it were sent out by the SDS, for instance.
25

15

1

without being invidious, having mentioned them twice, you

2

might read it in another light.

3
4
5

Wow the argument of our adversary is, you shouldn't

j

be entitled to do that.
I don’t see where that follows there.

I think the

|
6

voter, if our goal is an intelligent electorate to participate

7

in a democracy with such complicated decisions, I think the

©

voters are entitled to know who is advocating what in order

9

to be able to measure the statements that are made with respect

10
11
12

13

to the particular candidate.
Q

What is the particular State interest on which

the State relies?
A

The State interest .is, as 1 said, in the first

14

place is a corrupt practice to enforce the corrupt practices,

15

secondly, to expose to the voter the identity of the person

16

circulating the political literature so that the voter can

17

have an opportunity to evaluate and appraise the statements

18

made with respec t to a candidate or a proposition.

19

That is the primary purpose.

20

Now, if in the course of that, it appears that some­

21

body is making a -- which was a fact in 1956 — there was

22

political literature circulated in Brooklyn also with respect

23

to a candidate for a U„ S. Senator, anonymous campaign litera­

24

ture, making derogatory statements about the same subject that

25

was brought up by Mr. Zwickler, that he was not a fervent
16

I

exponent of Israel or a fervent campaigner for Israel.

c.

in I960, there was anonymous campaign literature circulated

3

upstate with respect to the then candidate-for President, the

4

late John F. Kennedy, with respect to some personal matters.

And

That is the type of literature, campaign literature,

5
S

that some people don8t want to put their name and address to

7

which falls in the category.

0

But the voter is entitled to know who is circulating this

9

literature in order to be able to appraise it.

10

n
12

It may be true.

It may be untrue,

Q

He wouldn8t know if only the name of the printer

A

The experiment with the printer didn't work

appears?

13

out for the reason that as you may know, Justice Fortas, the

14

Union Printers in New York City have this bug there.

15

the circulars were coming out, each bug says Allied Trade

16

Printing Council or something like that and it says 301, which

17

would identify the printing plant that was putting it out.

IS

19
20

When

When it used to come out, you t^ould see faintly
Allied Printing, but you wouldn't catch the number.
Q

Well, assuming that there is a substantial and

21

appropriate purpose for the New York Legislature in enacting

22

this statute, making this requirement, I suppose the problem

23

ariscis because on the other hand there is at least a substantia;!

24

body of opinion to the effect, that there ought to be the

25

opportunity for invective with immunity in a political campaign,

Only in this particular case, sir.

But other­

wise you could put down any committee which is defined in the
/
election law as three or more people.
Q
would assume.

It would have to be a bona fide committee, I
You don't read this statute as meaning that you

can just invent a fictitious committee, do you?

Can you

satisfy this statute by inventing the name of a fictitious
nonexistent committee and putting that on your handbill?
A

I don't know.

I can't answer that.

But I know

that the statute is intended —■ I assume that the statute is
intended to recognize any committee.

You don't have to pass

any registration or license test.
Q

But I assume that it is not a foolish statute

that would allow people to invent a name and stick it on there.
A

If you issue the circulars under the name of

the ABC Committee in connection with the election campaign, you
would have to file a report, if you want to live up to the law.
So to find out whether it is a real committee or a fake

25

1

committee, and secondly, the mere fact it had the name ABC

2

Committee with the literature would at least achieve one of

a

the purposes of the statute because a voter would be able to

4

say, "Who is this committee?

5

I will appraise the information about this candidate or

6

proposition properly."

7

Q

I don’t know this committee so

If I am to publish some literature -- if I am

8

publishing a piece of political literature, I should sign my

9

own name, not somebody else's?

10

2
3

A

Yes, you can sign your own name.

Q

Yes, but I can't make up a name for myself, can

I?

A

No, you can’t make up a name.

But Justice

4

Fortas says supposing it is a made up name.

Well, inasmuch as

5

you don't have to register or get a license, there would be

16

no way of checking on that except that as I pointed out to

7

Justice Fortas, at the appropriate time you would have to file

8

a campaign report.

19

20
21

22
23
24

In that way it would appear.

So whether you are a

legitimate committee or just made up a name.
I submit to the Court that the disposition by the
Three-Judge Court should be reversed.
Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EMANUEL REDFIELD, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR, REDFIELD:

3
4
5

Mr, Chief Justice, members of the

Court,
Before I reach the. stat\ite itself, I would like to

6

make a few remarks with respec to the facts of this case so

7

that there should be some clarity.

8
9
10

It seems to be confused both in the brief and in the
oral argument of the appellant.
First of all, this is an appeal from a final judgment

II

of the District Court,

U

or anything of the sort.

13

rendered a final judgment.

14

what occurred here.

15

It is not an appeal from Judge Rosling
It is a Three-Judge Court who
Now I say it is final because of

At the preliminary stages when I made a motion for

16

a temporary injunction they counted it as a motion to dismiss.

17

After hearing, June 9, 1966, the counsel stipulated because

18

it was obvious to both of us that there were no issues of fact

19

involved in this case that the court treat that application

20
21

22
23

24
25

for temporary injunction as if it were the final hearing for
final judgment.
And the statement to that effect appears in the
record on page 25.
Now, in the judgment itself, the Court said, "And
the parties having stipulated at the hearing on June 9, 1966,
20

1

thcit

2

ment/' and then at the last oral argument in this Court, it

3

was conceded by my opponent on questioning by Chief Justice

the court treat plaintiff's motion as one for final judg­

and Justice Black that there were no issues of fact involved
5
6

here.
In fact, there couldn't be any issues.

Most of the

7

matters were those of public record.

Therefore, under such a

8

concession and because of the stipulation in the District Court,

9

we have to turn to the complaint which says that the plaintiff

10

desires and intends to distribute in the Borough of Brooklyn

ia

at the place where he had previously done —• at various places

12

in said counties, the anonymous leaflet herein described and

13

similar anonymous leaflets all prepared by and at the instance

14

of a person other than the plaintiff.

15
16
17

And so on.

I don't want to take the limited time I

have here, your Honor, to go into that.
It goes on further to say that the defendant Koota

13

previously prosecuted the plaintiff and was a diligent and

19

conscientious public officer and pursuant to his duties intends

20

to again prosecute the plaintiff.

21

Because of the previous prosecution of the plaintiff

22

in making the distribution of the leaflet and because of the

23

prosecution of him, plaintiff is in fear of exercizing his

24

right to make distributions as aforesaid and is in danger of

25

agair. being prosecuted, therefore, and unless the right of
21

1

expression is declared by this court without submitting himself

2

to the penalties of the statute.

3

This concession, this admission there was no answer

4

ever filed controverting these allegations should put the facts

5

in the proper light.

6

Q

Now, Mr. Redfield, since our decision in Zwickler

7

against Koota, the Congressman Multer has gone on the Bench,

8

hasn't he?

9

A

Yes, but this was not directed to Multer itself.

10

Q

I know, but that is what I want to ask you

11

about.

Now the position is that Mr. Zwickler says that his

12

burning desire to distribute anonymous literature is not con-

13

fined to former Congressman Multer but it relates to unnamed,

14

unspecified persons who may in the future run for office.

15

Is that the case in controversy?

16

A

17
18

Yes, and he also says that he wants to use even

this particular pamphlet to show what the state of the political
world is.
Q

19

That particular pamphlet that was before us in

20

Zwickler against Koota related to the then Congressman Multer,

21

didn't it?

22

A

It spoke of him.

23

Q

I don't suppose the distribution of a pamphlet

24

about Mr. Multer, now Judge Multer, would come within the

25

statute anyway.

He is on the Bench.
22

He is not going to run

1

for political office, of course»
A

2
3

Yes, but this pamphlet doesn’t say don’t vote

for Multer or anything like that»

It is a political tract,

4

Q

But it relates to Congressman Multer.

5

A

It could say Thomas Jefferson on it, too,

6

Q

It doesn't.

7

was a statutory requirement, as I understand it, isn't it?

3
9
10
11

He isn’t running for office which

A

It is a campaign piece of political literature,

Q

It has to be in a political campaign, somebody

too.

running for office, isn't that right?

\z

A

13

Q

Let us just take that down if you don't mind.

A

Yes.

Unless it relates to a campaign in which some­

A

Well, that is only one part of the statute.

You are only choosing one part.
situations.
Q

It refers to many other

It refers to party councils for one.
It refers to elections, doesn't it, except for

this somewhat ambiguous reference to propositions for amending
the Constitution?
A

It refers to the election of public officers,

party officials, candidates for nominations -23

i

Q

But elections?

2

A

Party positions, yes.

3

Q

And the only person that was involved in the

4

original case, the only person that there has been any dis-

5

losura: as to whom there has been any disclosure that Mr. Zwicklc nr

6

wants to distribute anonymous pamphlets prepared by somebody

7

else allegedly is Mr. Multer who is now on the Bench and there

8

is no allegation that he is about to run for any office, party

9

or otherwise.

Is that right?

10

A

That is right.

11

Q

That is a problem about whether there is here

12
13

a justiciable controversy, isn't it?
A

That is what is sought to be raised.

But I

14

don't think there is merit to that.

15

allegations of the amended complaint which says that the said

16

distribution is intended to be made at any time during the

17

election campaign of 1966, and in subsequent election campaigns

18

or in connection with any election of party officials, nomi­

19

nations, to public office and party positions, that may occur

20

subsequent to said election campaign of 1966.

21

22
23
24
25

Q

Because if you take the

What you are really seeking here is a ruling in

the abstract?
A

No, sir, it is not in the abstract because this

man wishes to use this document in connection with other cam­
paign situations such as he alleges in the complaint.

24

The

1

only reason ha has not done so, he has been thwarted.

The

2

fact is that he wanted to use it in this past election and it

3

was only because of Justice Harlan5s stay that was granted to

4

the appellant that he couldn't use it.

5

I should also point out the fact that if there were

6

no vitality to this case, 1 don't think there would have been

7

any necessity for a stay.

S

for a stay shows that they were afraid of what Zwickler might

9

do.

The fact is that they came in crying

That alone should satisfy the court.

10

Q

That is not what they said --

1?

A

He suggested in the complaint that he was in­

12

13

tending to do it.
Q

That was before the Court.

It would have been rather confusing to the

14

voters, wouldn't it, to attack somebody who wasn't running for

15

office, who had a different job?

16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

A

He wasn't attacking Multer.

He was going to

use this thing to show, for example, what those people could
do, the Democrats for example.
As long as we are on that question, I was a little
out of order of my argument, but as long as you bring that up,
I also would like to call your attention to two of your recent
decisions here within the last few months, the Carroll case
and the Epperson case.
In the Epperson case in which Justice Fortas wrote
the decision, the opinion of the court rather, the person who
25

i

sought to get a ruling as to the validity of the evolution law

2

of Arkansas and had left his job, or her job, had moved out of

3

the State, and also it was shown that there were no prosecu­

4

tions under this statute.
Yet, Mr. Justice Fortas in his opinion says, well,

5
6

the case is before us, and we should review it.
In the Carroll case, an injunction had been granted

7
8

for ten days and yet although the injunction had expired

0

almost two years, nevertheless this court granted review.

10
11
12

13

14
15
16

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

Q

With regard to the right to anonymity --

A

The right to anonymity is, I should say, a form

of expression.

I wouldn't say that where the right is an

anynymity, it would be like saying what right is there of
anybody to talk in this world or to express themself in this
world.
The fact is that anonymity has existed for centuries
and centuries in all phases of the literature and expression.
Well, if we don't want to go back in history, I will go back
when I get to it, but our daily life consists of anonymous
expression.
You walk along the street and you see picket signs,
down with so and so, dump so and sc and nobody signs his name
to those things.

There are scrawls all over walls concerning

political candidates and no requirement is made that anybody
sign his name to scrawls.

25
26

1

Anyone can grouch about political life and political

2

personages and criticize but never having to identify himself.
Then that leads me to the case of Thomas against

3

Collins in which a person sought to speak in public -- -

4
5

Q

This is part of the natural law?

0

A

The natural law?

Well, I don't know about the

natural law, Judge, but I know it is a natural person.

7

Q

8

You pointed out that as written a person has a

right to anonymity?

9

A

10

Well, he has a right to express himself.
It is part of it.

That

11

is what I say.

It is like saying to me,

12

what right have I got to make spaces between words in ancient

13

literature, if I recall.
Well, there were no spaces between words.

14

space my words.

15

I want to make paragraphs.

I like to write in.

16

I want to

This is the manner

I like to write without signing my name

and I don't see why anybody, any Government should have a right

17

to say that I must sign my name to anything that I write.

18

The history is filled with anonymous literature

19

which extends back to the beginnings of this country and before

20

that and you will find before the Constitution, Benjamin

21

Franklin wrote under about 50 pseudonyms.

22

Q

23

Mr. Redfield, suppose this statute required no

more than an endorsement paid for by whoever paid for it.

24

What would you do then?

25

27
i

1

A

I don't think one has to identify himself.

2

Q

I guess you concede vrith me that a state that

3

has a Corrupt Practices Act and uses this as a device to

4

enforce the limitations on payments for political advertise­

5

ments, would at least have a state interest in wanting to have

6

it appeared who had paid for a particular advertisement.
Would you concede that much?

7
8

That it would have a

state interest?
A

9

Not in that respect, no.

I don’t see why

10

anonymity should be placed on that ground because they want

11

to determine how the expenditures were made for a campaign

12

literature.

13

Q

14

A

Yes, sir, I think that is what he said.

15

Q

I don’t think it was.

16
17

18
19
20
21

22
23
24

25

Now wait a minute.

That isn’t what he asked you

I think all I asked you

was, what would be your view if this statute merely required
an endorsement disclosing who paid for the particular adver­
tisement.

That is my question.
I think some of these taxes of these other states

are that limited, aren’t they?
0

What does the Federal statute say?

A

I am not familiar with the Federal statute,

your Honor, just in broad outline.
I would off-hand, I haven’t given it much thought
but since it is an interference with the expression, I would
28

1

say it would have nothing to do —■ it should have no overriding

2

Q

In other words, you don't think even so limited,

*?»
o

there might be a compelling state interest which would justify

4

it notwithstanding that it would have to be --A

S

Because the compelling state interest could be

6

determined in another fashion»

7

statute, too,

That is the trouble with this

8

Q

You mean there is some other means?

9

A

There is some other means of ascertaining it»

10

Q

What would the other means be?

11

A

I don’t know.

I am not prepared to say that.

12

will say this much:

13

is anonymous or not anonymous is not determinative of how much

14

is spent for it or who spent it.
Q

15
16

A

2?
22

; 23
24

25

Well, that I would always be prepared to say

but I am not trying to duck away from your question.
Q

19
20

I thought you would answer me that is my case

because this statute isn't that so limited.

17
18

That whether or not a piece of literature

Suppose Mr. Zwickler had been subpoenaed in a

civil suit or a criminal prosecution against John Doe and he
had been asked in court to disclose the name of the author of
that pamphlet, whether it was a libel action or whatever it
might be.
Would it be a violation of the Federal Constitution
that would compel him to answer?
29

I

1

A

It would all depend on the context of the situ­

2

ation.

In other words, if he is involved, let us assume, in

3

some

he might become incriminated if he was just to --

4
5

6

Q

I

am not talking about that.

I am talking about

the First Amendment.
A

The First Amendment.

Well, of course, I can say

7

that it is not this case.

8

he could assert his First Amendment rights under that.

9

course, I think the man has a right to speak without being

10
11

But I will say this much:

I believe
Of

questioned, why or who is the author of his literature.
Q

What about the opinion that Sciid that the

12

experience of John UdalL had as much to do with the passage of

13

that amendment as anything.

14

John Udali was tried so as he would not tell what he knew about

15

the publication of a book.

16

That is the self-incrimination ---

He defied this commission and would not tell them.

17

They sentenced him to death.

Our cases have referred to that

18

as one of the reasons of the freedom of speech and the privilege:

19

of not being compelled to incriminate yourself.

20

It might be worth your reading.

21

A

22
23
24
25

Yes.

I think the case of John Lillyburn is very

close to that, too.
Q

They are similar.

that hit it exactly in his trial.

But John Udall was the one
And he has been referred to.

The reason, partially, by our Bill of Rights.
30

1

A

I don't know what my time situation is here.

2

Q

The publication was anonymous and he wouldn't

3

tell what it was.
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN:

4
5

I think you have about

ten minutes.
MR. REDFIELD;

6

I would just like to come back to this

7

point about trying to get at ■— it seems that the appellant in

8

this whole litigation has shifted its position from time to

9

time so that I had to sort of stalk him all along to make sure

10

that I would cover all of his contentions at different times.
For example, at the early stages, he submitted an

11

12

affidavit saying that this statute is limited only to scurrilous

13

literature and then switched that it covered all literature.

14

15
16

So I briefed this thing and argued not any basis but I took
the most difficult situation first and that was the one of
scurrilous literature.
As to what overriding State interest is involved here,

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

assuming you wish to balance an overriding State interest
against the First Amendment, I don't know of anything that
has been offered or said in the Appellant's brief which shows
any great need or great emergency or anything of eminent
collapse to society or Government if this law were not on the
books.
At one stage of the litigation it was said that the
overriding interest was that there was a need of locating the
31

1

scurrilous offender*

I don't think that this is of such great

2

interest to society that the First Amendment has to be

3

throttled.
Then you heard it said today that there is a right to

4
5

know,,

I don't know what that means, the right to know.

3

makes the whole question.

7

determine, whether or not a reader has to know who is the

8

writer.

11

true or untrie is determined by what is said and net by what
the author says.
Then another overriding factor that has been tendered

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

19

20
21

22
23
24

That is what we are trying to

I submit, your Honors, that the question of what is

9
10

That

is that there should be an opportunity to answer back.

I

don't think that is necessary, that literature has to be not
anonymous in order to answer back.

You can answer back

anybody.
If anybody wishes to answer back not anonymous lit­
erature, if he thinks it is that important, why it is up to
him to do it if he wishes to.
Then lastly, one of the things tendered here is this
expenditure question.

We want to find out how the money is

being spent,
Well, I think that could be determined whether or not
the literature -Q

I didn't think it was how it was being spent.

25
32

2

I thought it had reference to whether the limitations on

2

expenditures by particular persons, corporations, that sort of

3

tiring, that it was a way of policing those limitations .

4

t hought that was what the argument was.
A

5

I

Why should that be such an overriding considera­

6

tion to throttle First Amendment considerations when you can

7

have a statute directly at that saying that the party has to

8

submit its books to show expenditures.
Why say you can't publish generally?

9

Q

10

Mr. Redfield, if we agree with you, it would

ii

follow that a Federal statute or a regulation of the FCC

12

require the people in a political campaign to identify the

13

source of statements or advertisements on television during an

14

election campaign; that such a statute or regulation would be

15

unconstitutional as violative of the First Amendment?
A

16
17

18

would necessarily follow because you are limiting it.

Q

20
21

25

Why not?

A

I am

Q

Mr. Zwickler is not involved ---

A

22

24

That is

not this case.

19

23

I don’t think with respect to this that that

No, I am not talking about Zwickler.

I am

talking about it being that that is a different situation from
this one.
Q

Why?
33

1

A

Because Zwicker is not — the statute does not

2

refer to any compulsory disclosure of who is financing the

3

pamphlet.

4

It merely says who is the author of the pamphlet.
Q

Suppose the regulation said or the statute said

5

that on television you want to attack a candidate during an

6

election campaign on television.

7

author of a sponsor of a statement has to be identified.

S
9
10
11
12

Then the person who is the
That

i/ould be unconstitutional?
A

Then that would be similar to this.

That

situation would, but not the one about finances.
Q

But somehow you distinguish the financing,

who paid for it.

13

A

Yes

14

Not that I am prepared at this moment to argue that

15

but I am making the distinction in that one has to do with who

16

is paying for it and the other one has to do with who is the

17
18

author of these remarks.
I don't want to take up the Court's time.

19

I have covered everything.

20

that we ware dealing with scurrilous remarks only.

I think

I have assumed up to this point

21

Q

Were you defending the injunction?

22

A

Oh, the injunction, I would say first of all

23

they haven11 shown--

24

Q

25

No, no.

The Three-Judge Court gave an injunction

as well as a declaratory judgment.
34

1

A

Yes.

2

Q

What is the support for the injunction?

3

A

The support for it, I assume that the Court

Q

There wasn't any imminent or pending or threatens

4

felt--

5

6

criminal prosecution of Zwickler was there?
A

7

The Court felt what Zwickler has been subjected

8

to up to now might be repeated.

9

harm in putting it in as incidental relief to a declaratory

10

judgment.

It is quite commonplace.

Q

connection?

13

A

14
15

18
19

22
23
24
25

I thought we dealt with that in the last opinion.
Yes.

I thought so far as this case was con­

with the -Q

But I thought the last opinion tried to dis­

I don't think the latter would follow from the

But if an injunctive relief is granted as
