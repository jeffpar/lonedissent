ARGUMENT OF JACK GREENBERG, ESQ»

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. GREENBERG:

7
8

the Court:
This case is here on certiorari to review a judgment of

3
!0
11

the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, two Justices dissenting, uphold­
ing that State's prejudgment garnishment statutory scheme.
The case involves, we would like to emphasize at the

12

13
14
15

19

outset, prejudgment garnishment? that is, the seizure of wages
owed by an employer to petitioner, who is his employee, at the
outset of legal action without a ruling by a judge or a jury,
not after judgment, when judge and jury have ruled upon this,
to collect monies adjudged to be owed, the validity of which
prediction will ultimately be determined in an action to follow
in which the merits of the claim will be tried.
Petitioner was a $65-a-week wage earner and the amount

20
21
22
23

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

garnished under the statute was $31.59, or half of $63.18, which
was one week1s pay check, the money owed to her for the period
in question.
Q

And that is a one-shot garnishment under Wisconsin

24
25

law?
2

A
week»

One pay period»

In her case the pay period was a

It might be a month, if the pay period is a month, but

the pay period is a week»
Q

But that is all.

It can't be done again, is that

right, under the same underlying claim?
A
action.

That is right.

It cannot be done again in this

It could be done again in another action after the

determination of this claim.
Q

So the sum total is this $31 or $32.

A

That is correct.

Q

You mean the employer is perfectly free to pay

them for the next pay period?
A

That is correct; and, indeed, the employer pays

her a subsistence allowance, which in this case was also $31»59<
Q

But if the employee goes on working the next pay

period —
A

She gets all $65.

Q

She gets the whole, and the creditor may not attach

that also.
A

May not.

So the remaining $31.59, as I indicated,,

was paid to her as a subsistence allowance in accordance with
Wisconsin law.

The wages were withheld merely upon the filing

of a complaint, in garnishment on petitioner's employer which
alleged only three things, as required by statute.

These are

mere allegations that petitioner was indebted to respondent by
3

1

virtu© of an alleged contract? that the amount due was $420? and

2

that petitioner's employer owed her wages.,

3

On pages 3 and 7 of the record,, all that had to be

4

alleged is set forth.

5

plaint of garnishment was served on the employer and said..—

for the amount of plaintiff's judgment against said defen­
dant” —which would be the whole $420 — "and costs, of
which the said defendant will take notice."
The employer responded in the answer of the garnishee
saying he did, indeed, have money in his control, in his pos­
session or control, belonging to Christine Sniadach in the
sum of $63.18, and further that garnishee will pay from that
amount $31.59 as a subsistence allowance and will hold the bal­
ance of $31.59 for the further order of the Court.
Q

Does the Act of Congress last year affect in any

way future cases of this kind?
A

Not on this issue, Mr. Justice Douglas.

First,

the Act is not yet operative? and secondly, the Act merely says
you may not be discharged for one garnishment, and it limits
the amount of pay that can be garnished to 25 percent.

to that issue»
Q

But they wouldn't be able to, in the future,

garnishee as much as -they did here»
A

That is correct»

It is limited to 25 percent.

Then there are some rulings by the Secretary of Labor which may

be pertinent which have not yet been made, but it would not

Well, that would be a great deal more than was

garnisheed here, wouldn't it?
A

This was a total of $32»

Yes, but they can only take 25 percent of the

$65, assuming all $65 -Q

But they can keep taking it so far as the new

Federal law goes.
A

I think up to the amount of the debt»

Q

So it would

A

Yes.

be a great deal more.

Petitioner had no notice of hearing before the wages
were garnisheed, as I mentioned, because the garnishment action
and the principal action were commenced simultaneously by serv­
ice upon her of the complaint and principal action at her place
5

of employment at the same time the complaint in the garnishment
action, was served upon her employer „

In fact», while it did not

occur under the statute» it would have been entirely possible
to serve her 10 days later» and the first notice she might have
received would have been after some of her pay had indeed been
garnished»
This case is» therefore» unlike a post-judgment gar­
nishment case in which there has been an adjudication of the
existence of the debt»

It is unlike a foreign attachment ease

that some of the cases relied on below» in which funds are
attached to effect jurisdiction» or to assure payment by someone
who is not in the jurisdiction»
Funds owing to petitioner here have been withheld by
her employer by order of the Court» and those funds will not be
paid either to her or to her'employer until the termination of
the principal action» which has» in this particular case» been
stayed and has not yet been heard» and indeed» in any case» will
be heard some considerable time after the wages have been
attached„
In the Trial Court» petitioner made a motion to dis­
miss the garnishment proceeding on the grounds of unconstitution'
ality under the due process clause of the Constitution» assert­
ing that there was neither notice nor hearing as required by the Constitutione

This claim was denied by all of the Wiscon­

I find it

Because this particular statute seems to me to
10

be subject to the argument you are making, that it is highly

unfair to the debtor, but also subject to the argument that it

is highly inadequate to protect the creditor, this fraction of

one pay period.
A

5

Well, the on© pay period was put in by amendment

became so manifest, it was put in as soma sort of ameliorative

measure•

I might say that our opponent makes, and the court

below makes some reference to pending legislation.

legislation has been defeated in the last five sessions of the

You are not suggesting, then, that as a matter

of fact, the other 16 or 17 States, whatever they are, have the
same feature that the Wisconsin statute has in limiting it. to
one pay period.
A

On the contrary, they do not limit it.

Q

That is what is rather peculiar about this

statute, is it, if not unique?
A

That is, but as I said, that was put in by an

amendment a few years ago.
Q

I suppose we are also involved here with any

kind of attachment before judgment —

Yes, that is possible.

Wage garnishment is a species of garnishment»

Absent special circumstances, such as outstanding

debtors, foreign residents, and perhaps some special circum­
stances that one might not think of at the moment, but some good
reason.

This seems to have no basis in reason and also denies

notice and hearing.
This was justified by the court below on two grounds,
as far as we can tell.
property was not taken.

The first ground is that, indeed, the
The $31.5S was taken only temporarily.

The second is a reliance upon authority, essentially the Ownbey
line of cases and cases cited in the opinion which are also
discussed in our brief.
Our position on the assertion that this is, indeed,
not a deprivation of property, and not a taking, is that we
just have to say that is just a manipulation of words.
12

That is

?

not the case.

The taking of property is, indeed, a taking of

property in some sense.

about the interest.

whatever.

It. is a substantial deprivation to someone who is

n

if looked at in proportion to the circumstances of the individua 1.
So far as the cases are concerned, I believe I have

12
13

implicitly covered our position with regard to those cases in

14

response to questions.

15

stances such as foreign attachment, the obtaining of jurisdic­

16

tion, the commencement of an in rem proceeding, or something of

17

the sort.
Q

18
19

22
23
24

25

Is there any means whereby the alleged debtor

can relieve herself or himself from the garnishment?
A

20
21

Those cases involve special circum­

No, Mr. Justice Harlan, except that it has been

suggested in the opinion below that a collateral proceeding of
some sort might be started.

I might say first of all I think

that is rather illusory for someone in this kind of an income
bracket.

But as the dissenting opinion of Justice Heffernan

points out, and as a reading of those two cases point out, that
13

1

collateral proceeding is, for all practical purposes, limited

2

to the face of the Complaint in Garnishment as, for example, the

3

Complaint in Garnishment did not say the case was in contract,

4

tort, or on a judgment, but it does not become an examination

5

of the validity of the underlying debt, which would be the real

6

issue, and indeed the entire statutory scheme is focused in the

7

other direction.

8
9

The entire statutory scheme says you may not try the
principal action, the garnishment action, until after the

10

principal action is concluded.

11

nor a legal way that that can be gone into,

12
13
14
15
'16
17

Q

So there is neither a practical

Is .it your position that until judgment there

could be no garnishment?
A

Absent special circumstances that we are talking

about, I would say yes,
Q

So the entire case has to be tried and judgment

entered before there is •—

18

A

Yes, that would be our position,

Q

There wouldn’t be any preliminary hearing about

20
21

22
23
24
25

good faith or willful cause, or anything like that, would there*
A

Well, if there were a preliminary hearing pro­

cedure, and I don’t know the existence of any such procedure
anywhere, it would have to be a procedure which would indeed
accord due process rights, and it would have to be a procedure
in which the defendant, the principal defendant, would have
14

1

some opportunity, some siibsfcantial opportunity both in law and

2

practically, of adequate time and so forth, to contest the

3

validity of the underlying cause,

4

so substantial it really ought to amount to the action in chief,

I would say that should be

>

i

5

Q

Well, what vrcmld you say, then, that a suit

S

starts, there is an answer, and then there is discovery, inter- [

7

rogatories, "’Did you sign this promissory note?"

8

in 10 days is yes„

9

then to base a garnishment on, or an attachment?

A

10

The answer

Now, something like that wouldn't be enough

I would say not, because in this particular case,

11

while it is not a matter of record, there has been some talk

12

about it in the briefs, she would have a defense that she signec

13

the note induced by representations made to her which ware not

14

true.

15

Now, I don't really know what the legal validity of

16

her position on that would be, and that would not be anything

17

to be contested here, but I would say that a due process hear­

10

ing ought to give her sufficiently substantial opportunity to

19

take whatever position she has with, regard to the validity of

20

the underlying claim, so much so

21

of the principal.

22

at least something of the dignity of summary judgment proceed­

23

ings, which ws have in the Federal Courts, for example.

24
25

Q

that it would be duplicative

At least it ought to foe pretty close to it,

It happens not infrequently that in an action

involving a substantial sum of money against someone that the

15

1

plaintiff asks for an order preventing the person from trans­

2

ferring the property and it is based on some evidence that is

3

given, some threat of transfer, or something like that»

A

4

If there were some substantial evidence of

I believe is

5

special circumstances, such as absconding, which

6

suggested by the form of your question, I would say yes, but

7

there is nothing like that in this case and the garnishment

account?

16

like that, is a different kind of case than the one we are

Well, we are talking about this garnishment

statute and I suppose we are talking about you.

that it would be *— until judgment you could not enter any orde; rs
about a bank account?

Absent special circumstances»

16

Q

Even a large one?

2

A

Yes, absent special circumstances„

I don't see

3

how you could distinguish the large one from the small one ex-

4

cept that there are special circumstances if someone is threat-

5

ening to take the money away from the jurisdiction of the court.

6

But that is not here, and I think we make rather clear in our

7

brief that we would think that would be another kind of case.

8

Q

Does Wisconsin have a wage assignment statute?

9

A

I am not sure whether it does

or not, Mr. Justice

10

Fortas.

Our position would be the same with regard to wage

11

assignments if they occurred pursuant to a statute.

12

Q

13

A

well, that might present somedifferent problems.

14

That would be different? yes.
But if it occurred
♦
pursuant to a statute, our position would be the same. If it

IS

occurred pursuant to a common law scheme, that would then in­

16

volve other questions.

17

18

referred to here, require the man who garnishes the funds to

You mean you spent $15»20 to get this $30?

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

Q

Why did you do that?

8

A

Well, after over two years of attempting to get

the money through numerous letters, my client instructed me to

10

proceed with a garnishment because voluntarily Mrs. Sniadach

11

wouldn't even bother to call or come in.

Q

But if she just decided that she could put up

with losing $30, why, you haven't been very effective, have you?

That is correct.

days of the date of issuance, which would mean that this action,
both the principal and garnishment, would be returnable in the
County Court or a Small Claims Court, on the 24th day of Novemher.

Now, the statute does provide for an immediate trial on

the return date, and if the situationis so urgent, as has been
indicated here, the matter could have been tried on the return
date and the court would have handed down a decision on that
date.

this to the Court — being over $500, if I had sued for the en­

brought up relative to wage assignments.

We do have a wage

to a period of 60 days and then normally the amount is, by agree

He reviews the situation.

of the employee.

A

Is that a fair

No, I don't believe it is, Mr. Justicd Fortas.

I believe that a garnishment is a remedy which is afforded to

the creditor.

It is strictly a creature of the Legislature.

There is no question of it.

3

Can you go to the employer and* in effect, levy execution on

wages that are due and will it also reach wages as they come

due?
A

6

No.

Let's suppose you get a judgment.

It only affects the wages due as of the

date

of service of the garnishment papers.

that cannot be touched.

14

execution or without an execution.

15

of $1000, where your garnishment costs are not $15.20, but

16

every time you issue a garnishment you would have $30 involved,

17

because you have a filing fee, in such a case you would normally

18

issue an execution and then bring Court Cojtunissloner proceedings

19

to ascertain if the man has any assets that can be reached.

One further statement relative to the garnishment:

6

that although we are not required in Wisconsin to post a bond

7

at the time of a garnishment, there is on the statute a pro­

8

vision that if there is a wrongful garnishment, the creditor car

9

be sued for wrongful garnishment and there are actions which arc

10

now pending and have been tried and there can be substantial

11

damages for a wrongful garnishment.

12

So I feel the protection is well afforded and that,

13

as Mr. Greenberg had indicated, there have been five attempts,

14

or five bills introduced into the Legislature, to change it.

15

The last change was several years ago limiting the garnishment

16

to strictly one action..

17

must be a judgment at that time.

This leads me to Mr. Justice White's inquiry about
what would be a proper standard for a prejudgment garnishment
if some sort of hearing or procedure were to be established.
It should certainly be a standard, if one were adopted, which
would adequately enable development of whatever defense the

might have, which

would involve, in cases of this sort, sometimes considerable
