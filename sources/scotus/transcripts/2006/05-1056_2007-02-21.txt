ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

May

it please the Court:

10

The limited monopoly granted by U.S. patent

11

laws protects against the making, using or selling a

12

patented invention within the United States.

13

271(f) also makes it an infringement to make components

14

of a patented invention within the United States and

15

then simply ship them abroad for reassembly.

21

MR. OLSON:

No, I don't believe so, Justice

Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, suppose two parties

4

just, you know, parties that otherwise do not have a

5

case or controversy, bet each other that the district

6

court will come out one way or the other way in, in a

7

trumped-up suit.

Does that create a standing -

MR. OLSON:

This is by no means a trumped-up

It's a very serious suit.

The outcome, the

10

judgment, the amount of damages that must be paid is not

11

a matter of wager.

13

United States.

It depends upon the decision of a

of wager, which way the Court will come out.

MR. OLSON:

This is an entirely legitimate,

I submit, means by which parties may preserve a legal

issue depending upon how a legal question is decided.

21

will be paid as damages depending upon the outcome of

22

the appeal.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you know of any, any

MR. OLSON:

understandable that the parties might agree if the

outcome of the legal question that the judge might

decide is going to be X, then the consequence will be a

liability for Y. If it's -- if it's of the opposite

outcome, the outcome will be different.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That -- Mr. Olson, that

is the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what

you call the object code appears in the -- in the

computer that it's -- that is what is sent, along with

13

the master disk, and the object code is the critical

component, according to AT&T. In fact, wasn't that the

first question that you raised, whether digital software

MR. OLSON:

If I understand your question,

Justice Ginsburg, let me answer it this way.

AT&T has

that would be a component.

If the physical -

were actually put into a computer and used without more.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I'm a little

14

confused, because I thought the golden disk was just one

15

method of getting the software into the new computers.

16

And I thought it was the software which was arguably the

17

component, not any physical manifestation.

18

MR. OLSON:

Well, that's why I said AT&T has

19

taken two positions.

20

in their brief before the court of appeals.

21

decades of patent jurisprudence have authoritatively

22

recognized software to be a physical and structural

MR. OLSON:

The -- if I may answer that by

3

saying that people use the word "software" in two

different ways.

5

intangible series of 1's and 0's. We submit that the

6

correct way to understand the word "software" is the

What did the Federal

23

MR. JOSEFFER:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
It might help if I could start by putting

24

this case into its context in both the United States and

25

international patent law.

Section 271(f) is a limited
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

extension of normal territoriality principles that is

2

designed to shore up the prohibition against actually

3

making a patented invention in the United States, but it

4

does not take the further and extraordinary step of

5

applying United States law to the conduct of copying

6

parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is

7

properly the subject of foreign law.

8
9

As a result, in the context of traditional
manufacturing, for example, it has always been

10

understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while

11

companies cannot make parts in the United States for

12

final assembly abroad -- that's too close to making it

13

here -- they may make copies in a foreign country by,

14

for example, sending the design to the foreign country

15

or sending a specific part to the foreign country that

16

can be copied there.

17

That distinction between copying in the

18

United States and copying in the foreign country has two

19

critical dimensions.

20

foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish

21

the rules of competition that will govern companies that

22

wish to compete in that foreign country's markets by

The first is that it protects the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Joseffer, to the, to

6

the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign

7

nations that would have an interest in this, usually

8

when that is so, hear from them and in this case there

is a strange silence in that regard.

a couple points I can make.

12

been viewed because of the Federal Circuit's attempt to

13

tie this to software on the grounds that software can

14

easily be copied abroad, I think this case has been

15

somewhat narrowly viewed as a software case.

16

truth, there's no basis for distinguishing software from

17

anything else, and if the Federal Circuit's decision was

18

actually taken to its logical conclusion I have no doubt

19

that other nations would be quite concerned, like in -

20

in two ways.

like with anything, you could say a computer is also the

6

any copy of the same computer.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But in this case, you're -

8

but Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or

the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. JOSEFFER:

Do you accept that?
The United States view -- I'm

14

not sure exactly how much we disagree on this -- but the

United States view is that, for example, a blank disk is

not a component of this invention because you don't need

If these -- if these

computers are built abroad and are sold with Windows

installed, the component is the electrons on the hard

11

12

Is that what, that's your position?
MR. JOSEFFER:

It's the physical embodiment

13

of the software which in some instances is manifested by

14

-- by those electrons.

15

the abstract code in the abstract is the component.

16

reason that can't be is that object code in the abstract

is just a series of 1's and 0's.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that analogous to the

7

source and the compilation, the source being the design,

8

the compilation being the key?

MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

The source code and

object code are just different computer languages for

expressing the same thing.

14

reason to treat them differently.

There is no -- there's no

The point is just that if you treat the -

either the source code or the object code as the

17

component, that's just the design of the actual physical

18

software that goes into the computer.

19

you'd have a vastly different statute because any

20

physical part has a design, but the whole point of the

21

statute is to prohibit copying of parts in the United

22

States while permitting copying of parts abroad for sale

abroad.

25

If you did that

But if the design itself was a component
then you could never copy parts abroad when something

designed abroad would always infringe because the

because of the extraterritorial consequences.

when this statute was passed.

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Windows wasn't around

Well, the statute was enacted

10

in 1984 when software was certainly present.

11

to say that Congress was not thinking of software, but

12

that's further caution for not expanding the statute

13

beyond traditional territorial reaches.

14

this Court has cautioned, has said that it should be

15

cautious in applying existing electrical property

16

statutes to new technologies.

17

emphasized in Deepsouth that the caution against

18

extraterritoriality applies in this very context.

19

Congress is writing against the backdrop of normal

20

territorial principles, which are the making, using or

21

selling inventions of foreign countries subject only to

22

foreign law, and against the backdrop of Deepsouth,

23

which has specifically held that Congress has to speak

24

clearly to enact of statute like this.

Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp

notion should apply to an electronic world.

MR. JOSEFFER:

doesn't work in the statutory text and policies is that

protect the company's ability to compete abroad and to

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it

There is no question that Microsoft supplies

practice AT&T's invention.

difference between that and this case for you?
MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Breyer, there is a

21

long, long spectrum with respect to software that goes,

22

goes from high level system architecture to all the way

23

down through component architecture, pseudo code, source

24

code, which is, which is a description that humans

25

understand, and the actual machine language that a
37
Alderson Reporting Company

1

computer will understand.

Invention -- patents do not

2

specify machine language.

The machine code is totally

3

dependent on what type of processor it's relating to and

4

somebody who takes source code -- I could make an

5

argument that if you take, steal the Microsoft source

6

code, which is the crown jewel, it is the greatest trade

7

secret of this country, it will not be sent overseas,

8

but if somebody took it with a bunch of smart engineers

9

and said, you know, convert this into, convert this into

10

something a computer will understand that will combine

11

with a computer, that involves a question of whether

12

what's going on overseas is manufacture as opposed to

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But is there any precedent

for that sort of thing?

3

point now, I think, but however you put it, it has to

4

come down to the fact that this very, very complex and

5

detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set

6

of numbers.

7

application does not itself contain that set of numbers,

8

but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate

9

that set of numbers.

10

That is, I understand your

And I can understand how the patent

But I then would be quite frightened of

11

deciding for you and discovering that all over the world

12

there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be

13

thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this

14

one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of

15

information themselves and alone become components.

16

I'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field

17

analogous instance where the transmission of information

18

has itself been viewed as the transmission of a

19

component?

20

MR. WAXMAN:

I'm not aware of any.

So

In the

21

lower courts, Microsoft was arguing that the biotech

22

industry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious

23

differences between what is supplied in terms of object

24

code that instructs a machine and a, you know, a

25

sequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

nucleotides.

But I think we need to be quite precise

2

here.

We are not complaining that the component is an

3

idea.

We're not complaining -- we're not arguing that a

4

component is some form of information.

5

saying here is -- I mean, nobody is paying billions of

8

electromagnetic orientations and when you press a button

instructions, fetch the commands to the random access

12

13

in a form of patterns of electrical charges.

14

the code then moves back and forth, the instructions

move back and forth from the CPU and RAM, they -

17

themselves.

6

That's -

MR. WAXMAN:

If I can, I just want to make

sure I answer your question.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it's totally different

8

in that of course it violates the patent in the United

9

States.

The whole question here is whether or not the

10

person has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can

11

do or not do.

12

about is in the future it might be outside your field,

13

it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the

14

transmission purely of information is the transmission

15

of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see

16

in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction

17

and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create

18

other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri

19

dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that

20

detailed information abroad.

21

patent law and not the foreign patent law that would

22

govern.

23

And the -- the concern that I'm worried

Then suddenly it's our

That's why I asked for precedent.
MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

First of all, this

24

statute does not reach anything that is done overseas.

25

It doesn't reach what the German OEM does.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

It doesn't

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reach what anybody does overseas.

It -- it makes liable

2

as an infringer somebody who supplies -- who is in the

3

United States who supplies from the United States a

4

component with the intent, with the express intent that

5

that component be combined in a way to create a device

6

that would practice a U.S. patent.

7

-- I firmly am confident that if you look at what's at

8

issue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions

9

about what is or isn't a component.

Now I don't believe

I might think that

10

a design is a component or it isn't a component, but

11

think of these three features:

12

that is totally modular.

13

As I said at the beginning, the stipulation

is full of the word "copies", foreign replicated copies.

That's what we're talking about here, something that is

And Justice Breyer, your question about

10

someone who's got a really good memory and can go abroad

11

and recite the 1's and 0's, pictures can be taken,

12

copies can be made in lots of different ways.

And in response to Justice -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

His answer to me is that -

15

that -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if

16

it's just information, because it's really a method that

17

switches things at a level of detail that is impossible

to put in a patent application.

information in a patent application, it's transforming

it into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not

that, because if they didn't have a license to make the

MR. OLSON:

The making of the master disk if

7

actually used in a computer with a microphone and a

8

speaker, and that's the liability that existed in the

9

stipulation under 271(a).
