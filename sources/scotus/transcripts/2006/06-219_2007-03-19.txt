ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY G. GARRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We'll hear argument

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

10

Respondent asks this Court to recognize a

11

new constitutional tort under Bivens and the Just

12

Compensation Clause -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

up the thing?

15

Mr. Garre.

16
17

Mr. Garre, could you crank

The sound isn't working, I don't think,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think it needs a

little upcranking.

18

Good.

19

MR. GARRE:

20

-- recognize a new constitutional tort under

Hopefully that's better.

21

Bivens and the Just Compensation Clause that would

22

subject public officials to personal liability for

23

conduct that he concedes does not amount to a taking.

24

Recognizing that constitutional tort would require this

25

Court to extend Bivens to an entirely new context, it
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would disregard limits that have existed for centuries

2

on Just Compensation Clause claims, and it would skew

3

the enforcement of important public land use objectives

4

and thereby threaten public resources and public lands.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Garre, there's a

6

record here that the district court said there was

7

substantial evidence, enough to go to trial, of a

8

pattern of harassing conduct that included trespasses on

9

this man's lodge and leaving the place in disarray,

10

videotaping the guests, selective enforcement of the

11

grazing laws, a whole pattern of things, even asking the

12

Bureau of Indian Affairs to impound his cattle?

13

man says, this has been done to me by officers of my

14

government.

15

This

Is there a remedy?
MR. GARRE:

Justice Ginsburg, there are a

16

number of avenues that he could have sought to prevent

17

this alleged conduct and that he did invoke.

18

think that there is a remedy under Bivens or an inferred

19

action under the Just Compensation Clause.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We don't

Well, what is, what is

21

there that will really be effective, because if you tell

22

me challenging each citation for violating the grazing

23

permit -

24
25

MR. GARRE:

He can challenge the citations

for challenging the -- canceling the grazing permits 4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then the behavior

2

will continue and he'll get one more and one more and

3

one more.

4

MR. GARRE:

Well, I don't think that that's

5

a reasonable inference, Justice Ginsburg.

6

IBLA considered and rejected each of the alleged

7

administrative actions on which his claim is now based.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
question.

In fact, the

May I ask a quick

I had the same list of alleged acts, and I

10

think many of them are uncontested, that Justice

11

Ginsburg mentioned.

12

inform me, when the Solicitor General's Office takes

13

this case do you look into whether any of these things

14

happen and the Justice Department issues a warning,

15

don't do this any more?

16

Ginsburg explained you don't defend all of those

17

actions?

18

Just as a matter of policy, can you

MR. GARRE:

If these things are as Justice

Well, our position is that he

19

hasn't established a constitutional tort or an

20

actionable claim under RICO.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

MR. GARRE:

I know that.

I know that.

To answer your question, the

23

Government takes these types of allegations seriously.

24

It's taken seriously at the line level at the Bureau of

25

Land Management.

It's taken seriously within the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Department of Interior and it's taken seriously at the

2

Department of Justice.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because if this, if this

4

continues, your argument -- and I understand your

5

argument that there's no essential free-standing cause

6

of action for damages -- basically means he has a right

7

to go broke with attorneys' fees challenging each

8

individual incursion, each individual wrong.

9

Well, again that assumes that he wouldn't

10

get any relief out of the IBLA.

11

had gone to the IBLA and said, you canceled my grazing

12

permits for grounds that weren't valid, that the BLM

13

would have proceeded to engage in the same conduct.

14

fact, the IBLA -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That assumes that if he

Well that's exactly what

16

he alleged and he said, and it happened for over a

17

five-year period.

18

MR. GARRE:

In

But we know from the decisions

19

of the IBLA that he did challenge that they rejected the

20

grounds that he -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They may be wrong, too.

22

They may have been as much a part of the conspiracy as

23

the officers who conducted it.

24

those in the West who think that the BLM does, does act

25

quite arbitrarily and high-handedly and is, is upheld

And there are indeed

6
Alderson Reporting Company

by, by the, the administrative courts.

2

problem, what's the solution to that problem?

3

MR. GARRE:

Now, if that's a

Well, Justice Scalia, to bring

4

an APA action to Federal court challenging the final

5

decisions of the IBLA.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's one by one.

Every

7

time there is another trespass he has to go all the way

8

through the administrative procedure and then when the,

9

when the administrative court says, well, it was okay,

10

then he has to go through the regular Federal courts.

11

That doesn't seem to me like a realistic remedy, not for

12

somebody who claims he's being systematically harassed

13

for five years as, as is the claim here.

14

MR. GARRE:

Again, I think you have to

15

assume that his claims would not succeed either at the

16

administrative level or at the APA level, and if he

17

got -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't assume that at all.

19

Even if they, even if they succeed, they say, yes,

20

you're right, they trespassed, good for you.

21

what is the remedy if they did trespass?

22

administrative remedy does he obtain.

23

MR. GARRE:

I mean,

What

Well, if there's a trespass he

24

can go, he can obtain an action under the Federal Tort

25

Claims Act.

A trespass is an unauthorized taking.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

That's the way that this Court has treated it 1952 in

2

the Hasselly case.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- the photographing

4

of his guests who he brings onto his ranch to hunt and

5

they pay him for that.

6

follows them just to harass them, just taking

7

photographs.

8
9
10
11
12

And then he claims that the BLM

What relief could he get for that?

MR. GARRE:

Well, he claimed that they were

trespassing on his lands.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's assume they wasn't

trespassing.
MR. GARRE:

Well, he'd raised that objection

13

before the IBLA and the IBLA concluded, and we think

14

reasonably, that, given the history of the disputes with

15

this individual, given his litigious nature, that it was

16

reasonable for the BLM officials who were out there to

17

be documenting his trespasses on public lands, and

18

that's an important dimension of this case.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought there was one

20

aspect of the videotaping his guests, that the

21

Government was doing it on its own land, on public land.

22

They had cameras and the cameras were stationed so they

23

weren't trespassing, they were just making the guests

24

feel uncomfortable.

25

MR. GARRE:

To document, to document his

trespasses on other lands, and that's -- the citation to

2

the IBLA decision is at footnote 2 of our reply brief

3

and it discusses that allegation in depth.

4

In any event -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would really like to

6

have your answer to my opening question, and I said:

7

your only answer is each time something, he is charged

8

by the BLM people, he goes one at a time, engaging a

9

lawyer, spending a lot of time, but it was, one of the

10

briefs called it, dying a thousand deaths.

11

want that.

12

pattern; not one citation; stop this whole pattern.

13

does he get that remedy?

14

He wants to say:

MR. GARRE:

He doesn't

Stop, stop this whole

the Just Compensation Clause or Bivens, Justice

16

Ginsburg.

18
19

How

He does not have a remedy under

15

17

If

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What does, what does he

have?
MR. GARRE:

He can challenge, he can

20

challenge these actions under the administrative process

21

available to him under the -

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

MR. GARRE:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

MR. GARRE:

Piecemeal.

-- APA Piecemeal.

-- like any number of other
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

contexts.

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
that is other than piecemeal?

4
5

MR. GARRE:

He has to challenge each

administrative action -

6
7

Does he have any action

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I take it the answer is

no.

8

MR. GARRE:

-- that he claims is unlawful.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Were any of these

10

administrative actions found to be unfounded?

11

words, did he win any of the trespass citations?

12

MR. GARRE:

He did not.

In other

In fact, the IBLA

13

found that the BLM had a right of administrative access

14

to cross his lands to get to public lands which it was

15

administering.

16

quite different if the IBLA had found that the BLM

17

officers were acting without legitimate authority.

18

And again, this case would have been

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm surprised you say

19

piecemeal.

I would have thought most agencies in the

20

government have like an inspector general or someone

21

that you can complain.

22

MR. GARRE:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And they do.
You can write them a letter

24

and you say, look at what's been going on, they've been

25

trespassing, they've indicted me on a false charge; I

do something about it.

4

the newspapers.

And if they don't do anything

I mean, has any of that happened here?

5

MR. GARRE:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

It has, Justice Breyer.

It has.

And what's been the result

of that?

8
9

Maybe you can go to

MR. GARRE:

The result of that is it was

determined that these actions by these line officers of

10

the Bureau of Land Management were perfectly

11

appropriate, that they were dealing with someone who has

12

systematically violated the permits and conditions that

13

are found -

14
15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Who made that, who made

that determination, including the selective citations?
MR. STARR:

I believe there was an inspector

17

general investigation, investigation within the

18

Department of Interior that -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the Department

20

of Interior reached a settlement agreement in which they

21

told the line people at BLM to stop.

22

MR. GARRE:

There was a settlement

23

agreement, Justice Ginsburg.

But the Department of

24

Interior stands behind the actions that are issued, at

25

issue in this case, and I think 11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Nonetheless, they did

2

enter a settlement which included that this behavior was

3

going to stop.

4

MR. GARRE:

5

fair characterization.

6

litigation, any party to multiple lawsuits and claims,

7

there are many reasons why it might be deemed in the

8

interest of a person to agree to a settlement.

9

don't think it's fair to -

10

Well, I'm not sure that that's a
I mean, like any party to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I

Would you agree at least

11

to a minimum that we must accept for purposes of this

12

proceeding that what the complaint alleged, and what the

13

district court said on summary judgment, there was

14

sufficient evidence to go to a trial.

15

So we have to accept his allegations that there were

16

selective citations for violations of grazing -- grazing

17

laws, that they broke into his lodge and messed the

18

place up?

19
20

MR. GARRE:

This Court has to accept those

factual allegations, to -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. GARRE:

23

Okay.

-- to be sure.

So that's But the court

of -

24
25

That that's true.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
have.

So that's the case we

And you're telling me that the only remedy a
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

citizen, assuming the truth of those allegations, is to

2

fight these actions one by one?

3

MR. GARRE:

That's a fulsome remedy, Justice

4

Ginsburg, when you think of the claims that could be

5

brought administratively under the Administrative

6

Procedures Act, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, to

7

receive damages, to receive injunctions -

8
9
10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What damages would you get

for the trespass of a -- one, one BLM agent on your
land?

A lot of money you're going to get for that?
Would it, would it come anywhere close to

12

reimbursing you for the lawyers' fees that it's taken to

13

go, to go all the way through the litigation?

14

MR. GARRE:

If the allegation is that these

15

trespasses have in effect deprived me of my property

16

which is my business, then conceivably he could make a

17

request for a large amount of damages.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

20

MR. GARRE:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

He doesn't say it deprived

No, I think He is saying it's a

trespass; get off my land.
MR. GARRE:

He, he has made both claims,

24

Justice Scalia.

And I think -- he has, he has

25

complained about BLM officials exercising the right of
13

administrative access, which has been confirmed at the

2

administrative level and which is well settled.

has made the more general complaint that these

trespasses have -- and interfered with his businesses

And he

So that -

Can he get injunctive

Can he get injunctive relief?

You said

10

something about, that, you said they may seek to enjoin

11

conduct that they claim will amount to an uncompensated

12

taking.

13

Can he have this litany of things that have

14

happened and go into a court and say court, enjoin those

15

--

16

MR. GARRE:

Certainly he could under the

17

APA.

He could challenge the administrative actions he

18

complained about, and if court concludes those are

19

unauthorized or unconstitutional he could obtain an

20

injunction.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He can bring, he can

22

bring this, he could bring this not one action at a

23

time, but he could complain all at once about

24

everything?

25

MR. GARRE:

Well, the other thing to keep in
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

mind is that many of these discrete administrative

2

actions -- for example, take the cancellation of the

3

permits.

4

included 20 formal trespasses, disregarding trespass

5

notices by the BLM, 20 violations of his grazing

6

permits.

7

the IBLA and before a Federal court in an APA.

8

have an opportunity to review those allegations and

9

determine whether or not the alleged Federal action was

10

unlawful.

11

That was based on a course of conduct that

All of that would be part of a record before
It would

And if a court believed JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He could -- he could not

12

go into a Federal court with a Federal question?

13

would have to go to the initial decision maker, then the

14

I -

15

MR. GARRE:

He

He would have to exhaust his

16

administrative remedies, just like any number of other

17

people who believe that they have been wronged by the

18

Federal Government.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Part of his claim is -- is

20

selective enforcement.

21

maybe some of his cattle did stray on somebody's land.

22

But they are beating on him because of what they say is

23

his failure to give a reciprocal easement which the

24

Government is entitled to.

25

You know, maybe he did trespass,

To what extent was any of the administrative

2

that based on the legitimacy of seeking to extract this

3

reciprocal easement from him?

4

it's legitimate at all.

5

MR. GARRE:

Because I don't see that

Well, the I -- let me answer

6

that in two ways.

7

not an effort to extort or blackmail Mr. -- the

8

Respondent for exercising his rights.

9

First the IBLA found that there was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was that because the

10

Government was entitled to the reciprocal easement?

11

that why they said that?

12

MR. GARRE:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is

Well It wasn't extortion because

14

he should have given the easement.

15

MR. GARRE:

No.

I don't think that's what

16

the IBLA found and we cite the part of the IBLA record

17

at footnote 2 of our reply brief.

18

Secondly it's well established that the

19

Government can seek reciprocal arrangements with respect

20

to property.

21

Government to seek reciprocal arrangements.

22

The Court in the Leo Sheep case forced the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not after, not after they

23

have already given away -- I mean, yes; they could come

24

to him anew and say I'll tell you what, if you give us

25

this easement we'll give you yet another one.

MR. GARRE:

That's true.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But he had one in, from the

3

past, which -- which his predecessor had given a

4

reciprocal easement for, and the Government failed to

5

record the easement and therefore was is deprived of it.

6

MR. GARRE:

That's true.

But I think it's

7

important to keep in mind the scope of the claim before

8

the Court.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And they're mad at him for

10

not giving back that easement which they failed to

11

record.

12

MR. GARRE:

The BLM doesn't have to stop

13

enforcing its laws and regulations once someone refuses

14

to enter into reciprocal arrangements.

15

thousands of reciprocal arrangements.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are

It wouldn't be reciprocal.

What was the Government offering to give him in exchange

18

for his, his reaffirming the prior easement that they

had failed to record?

It had to be reassigned in order for

I did not -- I did not

understand that.
MR. GARRE:

Absolutely.

And it's in the

8

regulations.

The right-of-way has to be reassigned, and

it wasn't going to be reassigned because Respondent

refused to agree to the reciprocal easement and because

he refused to make rental payments.

As originally negotiated,

Was the right-of-way cancellable

Or how long would the right-of-way last?

MR. GARRE:

The right-of-way was for 30

16

years which was long than the 20-year easement that the

17

Government got in exchange.

negotiated at arm's length by parties that didn't have

the acrimonious relationship that developed between

And this something that was

difference between the regulation on the books and how

they don't -- the Government doesn't get its reciprocal

Just as a hypothetical, let's say

easement that it wants, and so it says look, we normally

2

don't strictly enforce these cattle trespass things, but

3

we are going to go by the book with this guy until he

4

gives us the right-of-way.

5

over the line we are going to hit him with a trespass

6

citation.

7

they're going to do it for him because they want to get

8

the reciprocal right-of-way.

9

inappropriate?

10

Every time his cattle cross

They don't do it for anybody else but,

MR. GARRE:

Is that appropriate or

Well, first I don't think it

11

gives him a cause of action under Bivens or the Just

12

Compensation Clause.

13

Second -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that he can't -

14

but you're saying his remedy is to challenge each one.

15

But actually each one, his cattle did trespass, so he

16

doesn't have a good case.

17

West they don't actually give citations every time a cow

18

crosses the river.

MR. GARRE:

First,

Davis versus Passman was decided in a day in which this

5

from the Constitution or from statutes.

MR. GARRE:

It would be closer to it but the

22
Alderson Reporting Company

And we would urge the Court not to do so.

2

There is an overarching question here of

qualified immunity.

Whatever is true with respect to

4

whether this new constitutional tort should be created

5

towards other claims before the Court, the Petitioners

6

on this case were not on clear notice that their actions

7

in responding to someone who had systematically violated

8

the rules and regulations, which -- on the books for

9

some time -- would subject them to personal damages

actions and in fact treble damages under the RICO

statute.

For that, for that JUSTICE SCALIA:

land, they don't have the authority to cancel.

18

MR. TRIBE:

They didn't have the authority

19

to cancel it simply because of the transfer of the land.

20

They allege that he had made various technical

21

violations on account of which they canceled it.

22

the key point is, that was supposed to be the quid pro

quo, that is, they have maintained all along that this

throughout is, put this case to the side.

recognizes what I take it has not happened in the past,

21

that there is an action for private people to bring

22

against the government, Bivens, under the Fifth

23

Amendment, all of a sudden vast numbers of regulations,

24

the coal pillars in Holmes case, everything south of

25

that will be suddenly in Federal court as people claim

Alderson Reporting Company

If the Court

that what's going on with this regulation is there are

2

individuals in the government who have gone too far, and

3

they are just trying to get my property and the use of

4

it, without paying a fair price.

5

sometimes people in government do go too far, so many of

6

those claims might have some justification.

7

suddenly I see the possibility of this kind of action

8

becoming a major roadblock, an obstacle sometimes used

unjustifiably, and not necessarily, not necessary, this

Now by the way,

kind of thing, to impose a roadblock to totally

12

MR. TRIBE:

Justice Breyer, that -- that

13

floodgates concern was addressed by this Court not long

14

enough in Hartman v. Moore when the remedy in that case

15

16

someone for the exercise of her First Amendment right

17

was a Bivens action against the postal inspectors who

18

made this all up.

possibility that this would unleash a flood of lawsuits,

20

and it said that over the past quarter century, there

21

had been only 12 Bivens or 1983 actions against this

kind of retaliation.

23

many postal inspectors or BLM guys think they can get

exercising their rights.

position of the Government were more fairly represented

they would say, we don't want everyone to be able to

Some

of the -- Hartman is the First Amendment, and it's the

someone is simply making a nuisance.

9

The point I was trying to make about that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Tribe, could I ask a

question about the RICO claims?

10

MR. TRIBE:

Certainly.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Until I read this case, I

12

had never come across the concept that a Government

13

employee can be guilty of extortion by demanding money

14

for the Government and your brief didn't cite very much

15

authority for this anywhere in the history of extortion.

16

MR. TRIBE:

In the common law history,

17

Justice Alito, we cited two cases from New York, the

18

Whaley case in 1827 and Willett in 1915.

19

that body of New York law from which the Hobbs Act

20

largely drew.

21

that the fact that the government agent is extorting

22

property for his own employer the government doesn't

23

make any difference; it is still extortion.

extortion, just two old New York cases.

MR. TRIBE:

There are plenty of cases,

Justice Alito, that involve extortion for one's employer

where the employer might be a union or a corporation or

5

a charitable body.

6

been applied, in my research anyway I have not seen it

7

applied, to this kind of extortion.

8

clearly covers it and the language of RICO clearly

9

covers it.

10

But it's true the Hobbs Act has not

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the language

Suppose you have a librarian

11

in a courthouse and the librarian is charging lawyers 25

12

cents a page for photocopies, but there's some library

13

rule that says the fee is supposed to be 10 cents a

14

page.

15

Now is that, is that a RICO?
MR. TRIBE:

If the librarian thinks that,

16

the legislature is not giving us enough money, so I'm

17

going to deliberately use my authority to get an extra

18

five cents from everybody, I suppose if you could prove

19

willfulness, which is an important element of Hobbs, and

20

if there were several librarians and there was a pattern

21

and you could establish the other prerequisites of RICO,

22

it could be a RICO violation.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the two cases you

24

cite, the first one is the person who was charged with

25

extortion is a judge 44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. TRIBE:

That's right.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

And he was extorted on the

3

ground that he told the plaintiff to pay the defendant,

4

so the money wasn't given to the government.

allowed, and the court said:

the ground that the official keeps the fee or turns it

you troubles me about this case.

government agents.

that, assuming all of the misbehavior described here is

There always have been and I am sure

47
Alderson Reporting Company

correct, I'm sure it is not the first time this has

2

happened.

3

But why should there be this extraordinary remedy when

4

the overzealousness happens to be attached to a desire

5

to get a piece of land, whereas if they had just picked

6

on this guy because they didn't like the way he combed

7

his hair or for any other reason and had done the same

8

things you wouldn't have your Bivens action, right?

9

Government agents sometimes get overzealous.

MR. TRIBE:

Nor would Nollan have come out

10

the same way if they weren't trying to get an easement

11

in return for something which wasn't -- which you called

12

extortion.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no.

If they were

14

trying to get some other property for it or, or, or

15

money for it, it didn't turn -

16

MR. TRIBE:

I guess the straightforward

17

answer that I would give to your question I think is

18

that the Constitution does guarantee that the Government

19

cannot take your property for public use without just

20

compensation.

9

That's different from a freestanding cause of action.

thinking about this case there is -- there could be

12

something very wrong here, going after a person because

13

of what he's done.

14

15

and they go around hurting his business, they go around

outrageous and you might have an argument that there

that they're being vindictive against this person.

Fair enough, but it's an

So are you saying that

there was therefore no way short of Bivens even to

4

challenge or even to vindicate his claim of selective

5

prosecution.

6

MR. TRIBE:

He could have taken that one

7

item and under a decision like Hartman vindicated it.

8

But as is clear from the way he tried to challenge these

9

individual things and then concluded, as we explained in

10

our brief, that it was taking years and costing hundreds

11

of thousands of dollars more than was involved in each

12

individual one, that was hopeless.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I appreciate that, but I

14

thought you made the further claim -- maybe I

22

been based on the evidentiary record he made.

they were trying to get property for which they were

7

It's doubtful that they could have taken

it by eminent domain because the laws limiting the

ability of the BLM require proving necessity and there

is nothing in the record suggesting that they needed

that he couldn't access his own property as long as the

recovery.

13

MR. TRIBE:

You get -- you get full

The Westfall Act makes an

14

exception when you are making a constitutional claim.

15

That is, in 1988 when the Court passed the Westfall Act,

16

there were two exceptions 2679B(2)(a) and (b) were

17

constitutional claims and statutory claims.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't need the

19

Constitution to the sue the Government for ramming your

20

sailboat.

Basic state tort law.

21

MR. TRIBE:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

(A little laughter.)

24

MR. TRIBE:

25

Mr. Chief Justice You can answer.

It seems to me that state tort

law does not get at the harm that he has suffered.
55
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

gets at each individual piece.

But the main harm he

2

suffered is that they are circumventing the Just

3

Compensation Clause as the one way that the Fifth

4

Amendment was designed to permit the Government to get

5

property for public use.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY C. GARRE,

11

FOR PETITIONERS

12

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

First I want to clarify, the question of the

14

assignment.

15

position that a new right-of-way had to be issued after

16

the property was sold.

17

84, which is where the BLM officials made clear at the

18

outset that an assignment was required.

19

to JA 100 which is the right-of-way -

20
21

And our position, it's always been our

And I'll point the Court to JA

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. GARRE:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

They might have been lying

about that -

22

24

Point the Court

Well -- just as they lied about

a lot of other stuff, according to MR. GARRE:

Pointing to JA 100 which is the
56

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

right-of-way, which says that in accordance with Federal

2

regulations, and I point the Court to 43 CFR 2803, which

3

discusses assignments and makes clear that assignments

4

have to be approved.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought there was

6

something about Nelson having assigned his, the

7

right-of-way that he had to the Government.

8
9

MR. GARRE:

Justice Ginsburg, assignments

have to be approved by the BLM.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's -

Yes.

But it wasn't that

11

it was a new assignment; it was the former owner

12

assigned it and the BLA -- BLM approved.

13

MR. GARRE:

It was never approved.

And

14

that's clear, there was never any valid assignment.

15

That's why the reciprocal arrangement had to be

16

negotiated anew and again, I point to 43 -

17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then why did

you revoke it later, if it wasn't valid?

19

MR. GARRE:

It -- it was revoked as part of

20

the decision not to assign it.

21

the decision canceling the right-of-way.

22

assignment that could be approved, and rents had not

23

been paid on it.

24

assignment.

25

And that's clear from
There was no

So it was combined with the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't there be an

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

assignment?

Why, why would the prior owner have any -

2

any interest in not assigning it?

3

MR. GARRE:

In order for the right-of-way,

4

because these are rights-of-way to public lands.

5

have to approved by new -- once new property owners seek

6

to assert them.

7
8

And again the -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
assign it.

9

They

The prior owner did

The stopper was the BLM.
MR. GARRE:

But, but again it's clear -- and

10

it was not approved, and one of the reasons it wasn't

11

approved was because rents weren't paid and he wasn't

12

agreeing by the terms and conditions of the regulations

13

which are part of the right-of-way.

14

100.

15

And that's at JA

The next point I wanted to make, Justice

16

Kennedy, is we agreed this would be a dramatic new

17

extension of Bivens, and we agree with Justice Breyer,

18

the problems or types of litigations that this new

19

constitutional tort would create are really just -- the

20

-- capable of the imagination.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

different context.

23

what the Respondent asks?

24
25

Davis versus Passman is a

But in theory is it consistent with

MR. GARRE:

No, it's not.

Because the

Respondent here has more statutory and administrative
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remedies available to him than the plaintiff in Passman

2

did, including claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act

3

for trespasses, for any of the other alleged wrongs that

4

you've heard about here today.

5

wrongs that were addressed by the IBLA and the APA.

6

These were -- these were

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But their argument

7

is broader.

8

piece.

9

overall they are doing it to extort a property right

10

they don't want to pay for, and they are not doing -

11

other people's cattle cross over and they don't

12

prosecute them.

13

It says you can't look at each little

You've got to look at the overall structure, and

Now, let's assume that's correct on the

14

facts.

Are you saying that they have no remedy for that

15

type of extortionate activity?

16

MR. GARRE:

17

and they don't have a RICO remedy.

18

to Lujan versus National Wildlife Federation, where the

19

Court said that in that situation what a plaintiff must

20

do is challenge each administrative action individually,

21

and the types of programmatic pattern challenges are for

22

Congress, they're for executive branches; they are for

23

inspector generals.

24
25

They don't have a Bivens remedy

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'd point the Court

But what do you -- what do

you say to the argument that -- that you simply cannot
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

follow that logic ultimately, because when you get to

2

the point of the sort of the, you know, the death by a

3

thousand cuts, which is what they are claiming here, you

4

can stitch up every cut, but by the time you get to a

5

thousand, you're dead.

6

argument that this is quantitatively so different that

7

it is qualitatively different.

8
9
10

MR. GARRE:

I think the law and this Court

reasonably assumes that where individuals have remedies
available to them through challenging individual -

11
12

I mean, they're making an

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why is that a reasonable

assumption in response to their argument?

13

MR. GARRE:

It's reasonable to assume that

14

if there are actions against United States under the

15

Federal Tort Claims Act, or actions finding Government

16

conduct unauthorized under the APA, that the Government

17

will take action to prevent that.

18

Here every action that was challenged was

19

found to be appropriate and lawful under the existing

20

regime.

21
22
23
24

We would urge the Court to reverse.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, Counsel.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
