Mr. Russell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court.
A jury found that at the time petitioner

12

filed for charge of discrimination with the EEOC,

13

respondent was paying her less for each week's work

14

than it paid similarly situated male employees and

15

that it did so because of her sex.

16

the Court is whether that present act of disparate

17

treatment because of sex constituted a present

18

violation of Title VII.

19

answered that question.

20

The question for

This Court has already

Consistent with the law's traditional

21

treatment of pay as arising from recurring

22

transactions and giving rise to recurring causes of

23

action, and consistent with the paycheck accrual rule

24

everyone agrees Congress adopted for the Equal Pay

25

Act, this Court in Bazemore versus Friday held under
3

Title VII, each week's paycheck that offers less to

2

an employee because of her race or sex -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But are you saying that

4

the rule for paycheck decisions is different than the

5

rule for other sorts of decisions?

6

MR. RUSSELL:

It -- it is.

For example,

7

the respondents give the example of promotion

8

decisions but we think that there are analytical and

9

well as practical and historical distinctions that

10

Congress, that led Congress to treat pay differently.

11

As a practical matter, while it's always the case or

12

almost always the case that somebody knows they have

13

been subject to disparate treatment in a promotion

14

case -- they know that they didn't get the promotion

15

and somebody else did -- -it is frequently possible

16

for an employee to be subject to disparate pay

17

without ever knowing that she has been treated

18

differently than anybody else.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And certainly -

That seems to me to work

20

the other way around, just like the case we've just

21

heard argued in the last hour.

22

specificity here.

23

alleges that promotions were based on experience and

24

the employee didn't have the experience because of

25

past discrimination, why is that different than the

It's a question of

If the, if the employee, he

2

not allow the, a cause of action unless the

3

discrimination was within the statute of limitations

4

period?

5

I take it indicates that you would

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes.

Yes.

A promotion -

6

discrimination in promotion is different analytically

7

than with discrimination with respect to pay

8

decisions themselves.

9

decision the employee is deprived of the opportunity

10

to take on added responsibilities and therefore earn

11

more pay, but in, but the pay itself is not

12

discriminatory in the sense of treating people doing

13

the same work differently.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because in a promotion

I don't really see a vast

15

difference between a promotion and being elevated to

16

a higher pay grade.

17

different responsibilities but it's a single act of

18

discrimination:

19

the next pay level."

20

different from "no, you're not going to move up to

21

the next job."

22

I mean, there may be no

"No, you're not going to move up to
I don't see why that's

MR. RUSSELL:

Because, I think the

23

difference is that when somebody is denied a

24

promotion for discriminatory reasons the paychecks

25

themselves are not discriminatory.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

They treat

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

similarly situated workers differently.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Russell, I thought

3

that your argument was that yes, you know that you

4

haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got

5

the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an

6

incremental thing.

7

didn't get a raise, "well, so be it."

8

you have no reason to think that there is going to be

9

this inequality.

10

same pay, right?

11

You may think the first year you
But you have,

I mean she started out getting the

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes, and that practical

12

distinction I think does support Congress's decision

13

under the Equal Pay Act as well as under Title VII to

14

choose a paycheck accrual rule because it's

15

frequently that even if an employee knows she has

16

been subject to disparate pay, it's frequently very

17

difficult for her to have a good faith belief that

18

that pay is intentionally discriminatory without more

19

information.

20

So for example, if you look at that chart

21

on page 174 of the joint appendix, which summarizes

22

the pay decisions for one of the years at issue here,

23

if petitioner knew only the pay raise that she got

24

that year, she would know that she got a 5.28 percent

25

raise which is not - which is not suspicious.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

If she

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

knew what Mr. Conte had gotten, she would know that

2

in fact that pay raise decision decreased the

3

disparity between her pay and Mr. Conte's pay.

4

she knew what also happened with respect to Mr. Bice

5

she would see he got a higher absolute raise than he

6

did, but she got a bigger one than Todd.

7

if petitioner had all of the information in this

8

chart, that she would know that that pay raise

9

decision increased the overall disparity between her

If

It's only

10

wages and the average wages of men doing the same

11

job.

12

standing alone wouldn't provide a sufficient reason

13

to go claim intentional discrimination to the EEOC.

14
15
16

And even then the amount of that disparity,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How does, how does time

solve that difficulty?
MR. RUSSELL:

It's only after -- one would

17

expect in a merit system that there would be some

18

level of variation in the area and that would work

19

out over time.

20

disparity persists, when the different treatment

21

accrues again and again and the overall disparity in

22

the wages increases, that the employee has some

23

reasonable basis to think that it's not natural

24

variation in the pay decisions but actually

25

intentional discrimination.

It's only when it doesn't, when the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

In the paycheck accrual rule that's been

2

applied by the lower courts for more than 20 years

3

without incident, adequately balances the interest of

4

employees and being able to come forward once they

5

find out that there is a reason to suspect

6

discrimination, with an employer's reasonable

7

interest in avoiding having to defend stale claims.

8
9

I think it's important to note that the
Equal Pay Act, which everybody agrees has a paycheck

10

accrual rule, imposes all of the same burdens on

11

employers that respondents allege would have led

12

Congress to never impose a paycheck accrual under

13

Title VII.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What happened to the

15

Equal Pay Act claim?

16

VII claim and an equal pay claim and somewhere along

17

the way the equal pay claim dropped out.

18

You started out with a Title

MR. RUSSELL:

It did.

The magistrate

19

judge initially recommended dismissing both the Title

20

VII and equal pay claims on the grounds that there

21

was a nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity.

22

The District Courts held that there were fact

23

disputes that precluded that conclusion, but for some

24

reason only reinstated the Title VII claim.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why didn't you ask for

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the equal pay claim?

2

judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first

3

hurdle, you had a prima facie case.

4

you're a woman, and you're getting this and all the

5

men are getting much higher.

6

come forward with any other factor other than sex and

7

the other factor is that, your inadequate

8

performance.

9

As I understand the magistrate

MR. RUSSELL:

You showed that

But the employer has

We should have objected to

10

the failure to reinstate the Equal Pay Act claim.

11

didn't; we didn't think it was that important and the

12

time because we still had the Title VII claim.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because in the Title

14

VII case assuming you're right, that you get across

15

the same threshold, you're faced with the same

16

defense.

17

We

Right?
MR. RUSSELL:

Yes.

It's essentially the

18

same case kind of case in each instance.

Although

19

the jury has to find intentional discrimination in

20

the Title VII case; under the Equal Pay Act the jury

21

has to determine whether the employer has shown that

22

the present disparity is the result of some factor

23

other than sex.

24

always has to consider the basis of prior decisions

25

that are the cause of the present disparity.

And so in both cases, the jury

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you have to show that

2

at the time when a particular paycheck in question is

3

issued, there was an intent to discriminate?

4

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

The execution of a

5

prior discriminatory decision constitutes a present

6

violation of Title VII.

7

It's frequently -

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if the situation is

8

that when the particular paycheck is cut, the

9

company, the employer, whoever it is, has no intent

10

whatsoever to discriminate?

11

issuing this pay on a totally nondiscriminatory

12

basis?

13

MR. RUSSELL:

They think that they are

It still constitutes a

14

violation because they are executing a present

15

disparity that is because of sex within the meaning

16

of the statute.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if 15 years

18

earlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a

19

pay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and

20

that over the 15 years became the basis with other

21

raises, you think you can challenge the

22

discrimination 15 years later and say well, this was

23

discriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a

24

raise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect

25

into the current 180-day period.
10

MR. RUSSELL:

2

would be timely under Section 706.

3

would have an awfully good laches defense.

4

Yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That kind of claim
The employer

Would that be true if

5

there were a change in ownership of the company, so

6

the discrimination originally occurred under owner A,

7

then the company is purchased by owner B, completely

8

unrelated, and the, the disparity is used for

9

bonuses, etcetera?

10

MR. RUSSELL:

That would depend on the

11

general rules for attributing a liability from a

12

successful -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, under the, under

14

the answer that you gave to the Chief Justice and the

15

rule you propose, what of the case of differing

16

ownership?

17

MR. RUSSELL:

I would think that they are

18

still responsible in the same way that they are

19

responsible for other actions that the prior company

20

took.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that, but that would

22

not be the result if the reason for the disparity

23

between 4 percent and 5 percent was not a, a denial

24

of a pay increase to a higher pay level, but rather

25

denial of a promotion to another job.

MR. RUSSELL:

That is correct.

think -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. RUSSELL:

9

And we

Does that make any sense?

Well, I think that it does

for the reason that I said before, that that kind of

10

consequence is a secondary effect of the prior

11

unlawful employment practice, but under Evans, which

12

that kind of problem goes to -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you could call it a

14

secondary effect but the only reason you want to get

15

promoted to another job is to get more money.

16

think it's a primary effect.

17

MR. RUSSELL:

I

Well even if the Court

18

didn't think that this is a completely satisfactory

19

analytical line to draw, as I said before there are

20

good practical reasons for drawing it, and every

21

reason to think that Congress did draw it, because

22

Congress enacted this statute against the background

23

legal principle that pay, that the pay aspects of the

24

employment relationship arise out of recurring

25

transactions and give rise to recurring causes of
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

action.

And that's the rule that everybody

2

acknowledges Congress adopted under the Equal Pay

3

Act.

4

under Title VII would for example lead to the

5

anomalous proposition that Congress intended to

6

permit women, a white woman in 1967 to challenge the

7

present disparity in her pay, but not a black man

8

under Title VII because the discrimination there was

9

racial.

And to hold that there is a different rule

We don't think that Congress intended the

10

two acts to perform in such dramatically different

11

ways.

12

In fact CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Congress

13

could have specifically provided for the Equal Pay

14

Act rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that.

15

MR. RUSSELL:

No, it didn't have the same

16

elements, but there's no reason to think that the

17

difference in the elements -

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It didn't have the same

19

defenses because the Bennett amendment makes the

20

defenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under

21

Title VII, right?

22

MR. RUSSELL:

That's right.

And as a

23

result the claims and the process of adjudicating

24

both kinds of claims are not significantly different.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you go back to
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the 15 year old action which led to disparity that

2

continues up to today, and suppose at the beginning

3

or in July of 2006 the woman discovers it and brings

4

her claim and suppose she wins.

5

-- and here I'm uncertain.

6

rule in respect to getting damages that you could

7

only go back 2 years?

8
9
10

MR. RUSSELL:

Now, is it the case

I thought there was some

There is a provision of

Title VII that limits back pay to at most 2 years.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And in that case would it

11

mean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago

12

13

August of 2006, that she could only then collect the

14

extra money for the preceding 2 years?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

That's correct.
So it isn't going to open

up tremendous liability for 15 or 20 years ago.

in fact there's no reason to think that such claims

are particularly common.

they'd have to do is allege that sometime over the

4

past -- I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years.

10

They can certainly make that

11

allegation, but the employer is left open to avail

itself of the equitable defenses and they'll have a

very easy time of showing that there's been undue

delay.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your answer

2

before was that this is not -- if she's going to

percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this

5

builds up year by year to the point where see is

MR. RUSSELL:

That's true, but the

3

paycheck accrual rule also serves the function of the

4

much more common case in which somebody doesn't

5

derive notice of the potential discrimination until

6

the discrimination has been repeated over time.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't your position

8

that an employer violates Title VII unless the

9

employer periodically reviews the entire pay record

10

of every employee to make sure that there has never

11

been an uncomplained of act of discrimination at any

12

point in the past that would have a continuing

13

present effect on the amount of money that the

14

employee is paid?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

They certainly have an

16

incentive to do that under both the Equal Pay Act,

17

which everybody acknowledges puts the employer

18

subject to liability for any present disparity based

19

on any prior decision that can't be justified as

20

based on some factor other than sex, and that

21

incentive has been around for a very long time and

22

respondents aren't able to show that that's been an

23

unmanageable burden.

25

or not they've been paying the plaintiff less because

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How do they know that?

3

10 years ago the employee got a particular, got a

4

particular job evaluation and that dictated the

5

amount of pay that that employee was going to get for

6

that period and all, all subsequent pay built on that

7

base, and then it turns out many years later that

8

there was discrimination in the way the employee was

9

evaluated way back when, even though there was no

10

complaint about it; then under your theory that would

11

be a present Title VII violation, to cut a paycheck

12

that built, that was based on pay that was built on

13

this act of discrimination that occurred long ago?

14

MR. RUSSELL:

Because this Court made

15

clear as recently Faragher that when an employer

16

delegates pay-setting authority to a supervisor the

17

discrimination undertaken by that supervisor is

18

imputed to the employer as a matter of agency law

19

principles.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, yeah, but that

21

assumed a present discrimination, and it seems to me

22

the problem that we've got is the problem of

23

connecting a past discrimination with what may in

24

fact be an apparently neutral act 15 or 20 years

25

later.

MR. RUSSELL:

proof that the act is discriminatory is any more

3

difficult or any more difficult in concept when it

happened several years ago than when it happened 180

5

days ago.

still has to show that the present disparity is

MR. RUSSELL:

It may be a defense.

I'm

not quite certain how agency law principles apply in

that circumstance when there's been a change of

ownership.

But certainly when there hasn't been it's

not unfair to the employer to say that so long as you

MR. RUSSELL:

But if the employer can show

in fact that there is a disadvantage, that there is

7

prejudice, it can ask the court to limit the scope of

8

the claim or eliminate it entirely under an equitable

9

defense such as laches.

10

I think it's important to keep in mind

11

that this is not the first time that this Court has

12

struggled with this question when does the unlawful

13

employment practice occur in a disparate pay case.

14

This Court confronted precisely that question in

15

Bazemore and held that -- and rejected the Fourth

Circuit's interpretation in that case that the

present payment of a disparate wage was simply a

consequence and not in itself a present violation of

There was present discrimination.

It just so happened that the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

thought the assumption was that the policy was in

that the Court in the footnote misstated Bazemore and

that therefore we should trust to Bazemore and not

the subsequent explanation?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

I thought -- I'd take

10

the footnote in Lorance, if that's what you're

11

referring to, to simply say that, like a facially

12

discriminatory pay policy which discriminates every

13

time it's implemented, a facially discriminatory

14

seniority policy that discriminates every time it's

15

implemented, the Court was -- considered in Bazemore

16

a similar kind of recurring violation because, just

17

like a facially discriminatory policy, a

18

discriminatory pay structure or pay decision treats

19

differently -- similarly situated people differently

20

every time it's implemented.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that assumes that the

22

company in effect says, we have a pay structure and

23

our pay structure as it is now treats people

24

differently depending on sex, race, or whatever.

25

that's not the kind -- that's something very
25
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different from the ripple effect argument.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't think that it is.

3

For example, remember that in Bazemore there were

4

plaintiffs, workers who were hired after the merger,

5

after 1965, and when they were hired they were paid

6

the same rate as the white employees, and the

7

disparity in their wages in 1972 arose solely because

8

of the discriminatory application of a merit-based

9

pay raise decision, system, which is exactly the same

10

kind of claim that we're making in this case.

11

this Court nonetheless held that continuing to pay

12

workers, those workers, less than similarly situated

13

whites because of that discrimination that occurred

14

before the effective date of the act was still a

15

present violation of Title VII.

question.

increase would be appropriate but also to review past

case if that were the case?

Supposing in the annual review before a

The plaintiff would be

required to show that that de novo decision was

intentionally discriminatory.

3
4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You couldn't rely on the

past history in that situation?

5

MR. RUSSELL:

That's right.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because I think that's

7

sort of what Justice -- Judge Jofla thought was going

8

on here.

9

MR. RUSSELL:

I don't think that he -- he

10

couldn't have thought that because the facts are

11

absolutely clear and Goodyear acknowledges in this

12

Court that the pay system that they had in place

13

simply made an annual decision whether to make a

14

marginal increase into the raise and took the prior

15

salary as given.

16

If I could, before I sit down, I'd like to

17

make the point that to the extent the Court doesn't

18

think Bazemore decides this case, and doesn't think

19

that the statute is clear on this question, it should

20

defer to the expert opinion of the EEOC on this

question in which they have particular expertise

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

This Court has repeatedly said that a

actionable only if it concerns intentionally

13

discriminatory acts taken during Title VII's charge

15

And the question presented in this case

asks the Court to hold that a disparity in pay states

a timely actionable claim for intentional

discrimination if it is merely the result of

allegedly discriminatory actions taken outside of the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Nager, can I test

3

your theory with a hypothetical question?

4

20 years ago, there was an actual written policy

5

statement, we pay women 20 percent less than men.

6

And that was written up and everybody knew it.

7

then nothing changed for the next 20 years, and the

8

person then sued today.

was no intent to do anything, this is just the way

10

it's always been.

11

Supposing

And

Would she be -- and there

Would she have a cause of action?

MR. NAGER:

The answer to that, I think,

12

is no, if I understand your hypothetical, if the

13

employer was not intending to classify on the basis

14

of gender.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If present intent was

16

merely to do what we have always done, you have to go

17

back 20 years to find out that what we have always

18

done is the result of a policy decision made 20 years

19

ago that we can hire women at a less expense than men

20

so we will continue to pay the same rate.

22

MR. NAGER:

Would the

I think the answer is it

23

clearly would be untimely insofar as the allegation

24

is that there is discrimination today merely because

25

there was discrimination yesterday.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Whether or not

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there is discrimination going on during the charge

2

filing period, whether or not women are intentionally

3

being treated differently than men, I think the

4

answer, based upon your hypothetical, is no, given

5

what you've said.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the employer had a

7

policy of paying women, all women, 20 percent less

8

than men, and it continued that policy, surely it

9

would know in the present day when it issued those

10

paychecks that it was paying women less than men.

11

it would be intentionally discriminating at this

12

time, wouldn't it?

13

MR. NAGER:

So

Justice Alito, that's why I

14

qualified my answer to Justice Stevens, because I

15

think that the question his hypothetical raises, like

16

your question, goes to the sufficiency of evidence

17

necessary to prove intent during the charge filing

18

period.

19

there is anything in our position in this case that

20

tries to answer that question.

21

And I don't want in any way to be heard that

The reason I'm not trying to answer that

22

question in this case is because that question is not

23

before the Court except with one small respect.

24

the only thing that the plaintiff is relying upon is

25

discrimination outside of the charge filing period,

classification and pay that there was both a timely

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question that I

asked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and

12

that is, where do you put these pay cases?

13

put it in the box with the hostile environment that

agreement?

MR. NAGER:

It's in their brief.

They

repeatedly quote the portion of Morgan which

5

described pay claims as discrete acts subject to the

discrete trigger rule in the Morgan opinion.

7

that, of course, is an obvious concession that they

had to make in this case, because Mr. Russell would

I thought that the

to a black than to a similarly situated white is a

wrong, actionable under Title VII.

the Court would look at the remand order in the

11

Bazemore case, they'll see that the Court did not

12

remand with instructions that judgment be entered for

13

the United States merely because there was a

14

disparity in salaries.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Justice Brennan's opinion

16

sounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the

17

mistake was that the company made here is that they

18

didn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad

19

act, and they were trying to eradicate it.

MR. NAGER:

That's part one.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

All right.

So I

3

read that.

Now, this is my this is my cost/benefit

4

analysis here.

5

it's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies,

6

whether there's a practice or whether it was a

7

discrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple.

8

do have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of

9

things.

If we follow the other side's rule,

And we have heard them explain why there is

10

a distinction.

11

you can attack both, or whatever.

12

But we

I'd rather get to your side and then

Your side of it, it seems to me, if I

13

agree to you, I now have to create in the law some

14

kind of thing that sounds very complicated about

15

whether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a

16

practice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get

17

eradicated within the last few years, or was a

18

totally discrete act, and therefore, had no

19

implication as a pattern or practice that didn't get

20

eradicated.

21

That sounds hard.

And the second thing I guess I'd have to

22

do is to create a lot of tolling law because there

23

will be probably a significant number of

24

circumstances where a woman is being paid less, and

25

all she does is for the last six months get her
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

paychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay

2

is a complicated thing, and through no fault of her

3

own, it takes about eight or nine months or even a

4

year for her to find out.

5

to toll, aren't we?

6

And we are going to have

So I have, legally speaking, a complicated

7

tolling system that I have to graft on to this, your

case.

which is pretty hard to do.

I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore
But on the other side,

10

they are just saying, go with the flow.

11

really hurt, because the employer has to worry about

12

all this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act.

13

giving you that summary so you can just shoot it

14

down.

15
16
17

MR. NAGER:

Nobody is

I'm

Well, it was a compound

question, but I'll try to answer each of its parts.
The first point I would make is that

18

Bazemore came after Evans and Hazelwood and Ricks,

19

and it did not distinguish Evans or Hazelwood or

20

Ricks on the grounds that Bazemore is a pay case and

21

Hazelwood and Evans were not pay cases.

22

distinguished them on the grounds of whether or not

23

the alleged discrimination was taking place in the

24

charge filing period.

25

stands as a proposition that Evans and Lorance and

It

So this notion that Bazemore

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that line of cases doesn't apply because they don't

2

apply to pay cases was not the opinion of the Court

3

in Bazemore.

4

Secondly, we are not asking you, and I

5

don't think it takes any difficulty to apply the rule

6

that we are proposing in this case.

7

the same rule that's set forth in Justice Stevens'

8

opinion for the Court in Evans, the same rule that's

9

set forth in Justice Powell's opinion in Ricks, the

We are proposing

10

same rule that's set forward in Justice Scalia's

11

opinion for the Court in Lorance.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But there is a slight

13

difference in that you're focused on whether

14

discrimination occurred within the 180-day period.

15

And if I understand you correctly, discrimination

16

would have occurred during the 180-day period if the

17

employer knew of the policy that I described, because

18

then he would be knowingly paying less.

19
20
21
22
23

MR. NAGER:

No.

Not if he had knowledge

of JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought your answer to

Justice Alito made that point.
MR. NAGER:

Well, what I said to Justice

24

Alito was, if the employer knew that it previously

25

had a policy and if it knew and intended that its
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

present pay would be done for gender-related reasons

2

or racially-related reasons, it would constitute -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the question of

4

whether just knowing that that's a source of the

5

policy would be a gender-related reason.

6

MR. NAGER:

Well, the question is whether

7

there was a present policy.

8

Solicitor General makes in its brief and the point we

9

make in our brief.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's the point the

Well, in my hypothetical

11

there was a policy established 20 years ago, a 20

percent differential, never been changed.

15

doesn't.

16

MR. NAGER:

And the

And if the employer is

17

presently applying, and knowingly and intentionally

18

doing so, a 20 percent differential for male and

19

female employees for no reason other than the gender

20

of the employees, that's a present violation.

discrimination, then doing it in the present time

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

a policy that was discriminatory some years ago.

MR. NAGER:

I think if I understood the

question, Justice Kennedy, I think no present claim,

10

because the only thing you said that he knew is that

11

they previously engaged in discriminatory actions.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

present decision is necessarily based on some prior

decision that was discriminatory.

the employer has a duty to eradicate past

24

eradicate the alleged ongoing facially discriminatory

pay practices that preceded the enactment of Title

you have cases that are only about past

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. NAGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Title VII gives employees like petitioner

8

as a denial of a pay raise.

9

180-day period to pass may not years later and even

10

13

decisions that occurred long ago.

MR. NAGER:

If it met the requirements of

the Equal Pay Act, which is that it has to be the

18

same knowledge, skills and responsibilities and

19

effort for the job, then every time that you have a

20

failure to deliver equal pay for equal work there is

21

a violation of the act.

22

equal pay for equal work statute, it is a

23

nondiscrimination statute, and so that you have to

absence of equal pay.

it badly or well?

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

decision made then, that is to not, to not equalize

the pay further -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
then?

Why would she bring it

They gave her a big raise that year.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, because I think what

13

you're suggesting is they didn't give her a big

14

enough raise, because there was still intentional

15

discrimination from prior years that were not, that

16

were unchallenged.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't she have every

18

reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so

19

next year I'm going to get that same size raise, but

20

that it doesn't happen the next year?

MR. GORNSTEIN:

And if it doesn't happen

that next year, then that employee has 180 days to

challenge that pay decision on the ground that it's

differential policy established 20 years ago, it

could still carry it into effect today.

forward that differential based on the person's sex,

MR. GORNSTEIN:

The EEOC has taken a

different position but that decision that the EEOC

Justice Souter, I would

like to answer that question today but of course if

the Court doesn't resolve the question today that's

11

anything we would have to do would have to look at

12

that new decision and make a judgment about what the

law is at that time.

And so my -- my point is -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think I got your point.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Touche.

16

MR. GORNSTEIN:

To go on, there are three

17

decisions of this Court that control the result here,

18

Evans, Ricks and Lorance, each of which says that the

19

employee cannot circumvent the limitations period by

20

challenging conduct within the limitations period on

21

the grounds that it is the result of a prior act of

22

intentional discrimination that was not timely

23

challenged.

24
25

A second reason to reject petitioner's
rule is that petitioner's rule, as petitioner admits,
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

creates a special rule for pay cases when there is

2

nothing in the language of Title VII that would

3

justify a special rule.

4

mandate of nondiscrimination for pay as for any other

5

practice.

6

claims as any other claim.

Title VII has the same

It has the same 180-day period for pay

7

And the third reason to reject

8

petitioner's view is that it would undo the statute

9

of limitations in pay cases, because the result would

10

be, what you have here is that an employee could wait

11

until the end of their career, or at least a very

12

substantial number of years, and then challenge

13

current pay on the basis of past acts that took place

14

a long time ago.

15

about it being limited to just back pay during the

16

two-year period.

17

have not decided whether it's the 180-day period or

18

the two-year period if you buy petitioner's theory, I

19

don't think he has either.

20

additional point of order is you're still hinging

21

liability on past acts long ago and you're adding the

22

possibility of compensatory relief and punitive

23

damages, so it's not the limited damage award that

24

you're contemplating necessarily.

What would you do on the

allowing the woman, tolling or something, when she

to figure out that these are really reflecting some

old discrimination and she doesn't know.

It if you win on this, then

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It's

denied a pay raise and she's aware that other people

10

are getting substantial pay raises -- I don't think

11

it's that much different than somebody else getting

12

the promotion and me not getting that promotion.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, she knows this.

14

She knows that, all these boxes on her paychecks and

15

she's not quite sure what they mean.

16

answer is not much different.

17

MR. GORNSTEIN:

All right, your

Well, to the extent that

18

you want to address equitable tolling.

question, should there be equitable tolling until

20

such time as she's aware of the disparity.

more years and then sue.

16

conceptions, which frankly isn't answered by the

17

plain text of this statute itself, should be resolved

in light of the practical consequences of the

differences in the rules.

20

The fact

But the difference in the

The Solicitor General acknowledges that a

21

paycheck accrual rule applies at least in a case of a

22

policy of discrimination, but that's a very difficult

23

rule to administer for the EEOC, which must make a

24

determination of timeliness before it even has

25

authority to investigate a claim.

It shouldn't be

left to the EEOC to figure out whether there's an

2

unwritten practice or an unwritten policy which would

3

require an extensive investigation not only of the

4

petitioner's pay but of everybody else's.

5

that in Bazemore they had to conduct a multiple

6

regression analysis to establish a pattern of

7

discrimination there.

8
9

You recall

Our rule is simple to administer and has
been administered for decades in the lower courts and

10

it's the rule that the EEOC itself has chosen in

11

construing this ambiguous aspect of the statute.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you agree that their

13

action is just based on Bazemore or their reading of

14

Bazemore?

15

MR. RUSSELL:

No, that's incorrect.

I

16

mean, the EEOC has taken this position that you can

17

challenge present pay disparities even before the

18

Court's decision in Bazemore and it continued to

19

adhere to it afterward.

20

Bazemore shouldn't disentitle them to the kind of

21

deference that they're ordinarily entitled to when

22

they construe a statute that's given to them, and

23

this is precisely the kind of question Congress would

24

have entitled them to exercise their expertise on.

25

The fact that they cited to

Finally, I would like to raise the point
57

that under respondent's rule the Extension Service

2

would have been permitted to pay blacks less than

3

white in perpetuity in Bazemore so long as it did so

4

because of cost and not because it wanted to continue

5

to discriminate on the basis of race.

6

under the Solicitor General's view an employer who

7

had intentionally discriminated through discrete

8

decisions against some of its employees prior to the

9

act would be allowed to continue to do so after the

And similarly,

10

act because the decision would have been the

11

potentially unlawful act in that case and that

12

wouldn't have been actionable.

13
14

We respectfully suggest that Congress
intended nothing than a complete -

How could cost justify a

It could -- the Extension

JUSTICE ALITO:

You'd have to have another

20

factor in the decision, which was that you didn't

22

that.

23

But cost alone couldn't justify

MR. RUSSELL:

It would be a

nondiscriminatory reason.

4

intentionally pay-maintaining discrimination.

5

And under respondent's view that is not

JUSTICE ALITO:

No, you'd have to say, we

6

don't want to spend any more and we also don't want

7

to equalize pay.

8
9

You have to say the second too.

MR. RUSSELL:

They would say, we don't

want to equalize pay because it costs too much, and

10

that's not a discriminatory reason for maintaining

11

the prior disparity.

12

But ultimately -

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you say you're not

13

going to equalize pay, you're saying you're going to

14

discriminate on the basis of race.

15

MR. RUSSELL:

Which is what happened here.

16

Goodyear continued to discriminate on the basis of

17

sex, knowing as a matter of agency law that it had

18

done, it had set her pay for discriminatory reasons

19

in the past.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can equalize

21

pay by lowering others.

22

discriminated-against class is not the only way to

23

equalize pay.

justification for continuing the disparity.

25

You don't -- raising the

Act.

You can only equalize up, not down.

2

MR. RUSSELL:

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

That's true.
Under Title VII

you can equalize either way, right?

5

MR. RUSSELL:

It would, but if they chose

6

not to equalize at all because they don't want to

7

spend the money the money that would be a

8

nondiscriminatory reason.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

You'd certainly have a

very happy work force if you equalized one way.

11

MR. RUSSELL:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

Thank you.
Thank you,

counsel.
