CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

today in Case 06-313, Roper versus Weaver.

Ms. Spillars.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA K. SPILLARS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MS. SPILLARS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
While this Court has laid out a framework

11

for reviewing prosecutors' closing arguments, the

12

fairness standard established in Donnelly and Darden is

13

by its nature a very general standard.

14

Court's interpretation of AEDPA, the State court should

15

therefore be provided more leeway in reaching outcomes.

16

Nevertheless, the Eighth Circuit afforded no deference

17

to the Missouri Supreme Court's decision.

18

improperly substituted its own evaluation for the

19

comments, looking at each of them in isolation and

20

without considering the totality of the proceedings.

21

Under this

Instead, its

That decision was wrong not only because the

22

court of appeals failed to properly afford deference to

23

the State court, but because when viewed within the

24

entire proceedings the prosecutor's closing arguments

25

did not deprive the Respondent of a fair trial.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Applying AEDPA correctly, the Missouri

2

Supreme Court decision was well within reason given,

3

one, the nonspecific standard of fundamental fairness

4

and the fact that this Court has never applied that

5

standard to a penalty phase closing argument; and, two,

6

because, considering the record in the entire

7

proceedings of this case, the Respondent was not

8

deprived of fundamental fairness.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, we didn't -

10

haven't applied it to a penalty phase closing argument,

11

but we've certainly applied the general standard to the

12

penalty phase.

13

MS. SPILLARS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

14

And it's certainly is not our argument that it would not

15

apply to the penalty phase.

16

be other considerations, because the fundamental

17

fairness standard essentially answers the question, did

18

the jury base their verdict on the evidence or did they

19

base it improperly on the prosecutor's comments.

20

However, there simply may

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask one sort of

21

preliminary question.

22

misstated the law in his closing argument.

23

be reviewable in this Court under AEDPA?

24
25

Supposing the prosecutor

MS. SPILLARS:
be.

Would that

I think it certainly could

In Brown versus Payton there was certainly a
4
Alderson Reporting Company

3

concern about the JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think his argument

here contained any misstatements of the law?

4

MS. SPILLARS:

No, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

6

MS. SPILLARS:

You don't.

To help answer the question,

7

though, in that context, Donnelly and Darden set down

8

some general considerations that, while not exclusive,

9

help provide the post and beams of the fundamental

10

fairness standard.

11

statements were improper, those considerations when

12

applied to this case show that the trial was not

13

rendered unfair because of the prosecutor's argument.

14

First, none of the comments misstated the evidence nor

15

did they misstate the law.

16

So even assuming that all of the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, just on your

17

assumption, to make your hypothetical clear, you, you

18

want us to assume that three or four times at least he

19

violated a constitutional standard?

20

MS. SPILLARS:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22
23

No, Your Honor.
I just want to know what

arguendo assumption you are making.
MS. SPILLARS:

The assumption is that under

24

the first tier in Donnelly and Darden that the

25

statements were improper in the sense that within the
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

context of the multi-factor kind of considerations,

2

whether or not they were improper, because obviously -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, they'd be improper

4

because they -- they were based on an emotional appeal

5

that's improper?

6

MS. SPILLARS:

It could be improper in the

7

sense that it was a misstatement of evidence.

I don't

8

know that impropriety would include necessarily

9

emotional appeal.

I mean, the Constitution does not

10

require a trial devoid of emotion.

11

under Donnelly and Darden was the first tier of the

12

multi-tier kind of Fundamental fairness test.

13

assuming that that first tier, that the statements were

14

improper, they still did not rise to the level of

15

fundamental unfairness.

16

However, impropriety

So even

Secondly, none of the individual comments

17

implicated the defendant's rights under the Fifth or

18

Sixth Amendment, nor were they of the very specific kind

19

of comments that this Court has found to violate the

20

Eighth Amendment under Caldwell.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Don't you think the

22

argument based on the General Patton analogy told the

23

jurors they had a duty to do what he suggested?

24
25

MS. SPILLARS:

No, Your Honor.

disagree.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What is the relevance of

that argument otherwise?

3

MS. SPILLARS:

I would not -- it was not

4

particularly relevant.

5

attempt to imply or tell the jury that it was a

6

difficult decision that they had ahead of them, one that

7

they might -

8
9
10

It was probably an inartful

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think if he said in

so many words, you have a duty to return the death
penalty, that would have been a misstatement of the law?

11

MS. SPILLARS:

Yes, a duty to return the

12

death penalty, which certainly is a misstatement of the

13

law.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And you don't think this

15

could be so interpreted?

You don't think you could

16

interpret that, that passage, that way?

17

MS. SPILLARS:

No, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That passage was in the

19

context of other statements in which I think it's fair

20

to say that he analogized the role of the juror to the

21

role of a soldier who has to have the courage and the

22

duty to kill.

23

MS. SPILLARS:

I think a reasonable

24

interpretation of those statements could be that the

25

duty was to make the decision whether or not to impose
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the death penalty.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

Why is it improper

3

for, for the prosecution to argue that, given the facts

4

of this case, given the aggravating factors and the lack

5

of mitigating factors, the brutality of the crime, the

6

only sensible decision for you ladies and gentlemen of

7

the jury is the death penalty?

8

argument?

9

to come back with the death penalty?

10

That's an improper

Doesn't that amount to saying you have a duty
Why can't the

prosecution argue that?

11

MS. SPILLARS:

It's certainly not improper

12

to make statements based on inferences from the

13

evidence.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, do you think the

15

Patton argument has anything to do with the evidence?

16

mean, the Patton argument -- correct me if I'm wrong,

17

but I thought the argument that referred to General

18

Patton was an argument that, number one, talked about

19

his addressing the troops before battle.

20

telling the troops that unfortunately it is sometimes

21

their duty to kill.

22

your duty, which I assume any reasonable listener would

23

say, go out there and kill.

24
25

And he said:

I

And he was

Go out there and do

If a prosecutor, as in this case, tells that
story and uses that analogy, it seems to me that the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument is not an argument based on evidence, but an

2

argument based upon the situation, the situation of the

3

jurors vis a vis a capital defendant.

4

And I would suppose that the reasonable

5

inference from the argument is that they have a duty to

6

go out there to kill, to impose the death penalty.

7

does not sound to me like an argument based upon the

8

evidence specific to this defendant and specific to this

9

case.

10

Now, am I wrong?

11

MS. SPILLARS:

No, Your Honor.

That

It certainly

12

was not a statement on the evidence in sense of was it a

13

discussion of the facts in the case.

14

the totality of the entire proceedings, it's clear that

15

that statement did not render the entire trial unfair

16

because -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

However, based on

I don't understand your

18

concession.

Surely, the prosecutor was not telling this

19

jury that in all capital cases you have to come in with

20

a death verdict.

21

mention the evidence, the underlying premise of his

22

argument was sometimes when you have a case this bad,

23

you have to do your duty.

24

just as soldiers sometimes have to do that if that's

25

their duty, so also jurors, if you really believe that

Surely, although he didn't explicitly

Nobody likes to kill, but

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the evidence is so one-sided in favor of the penalty

2

that the State is asking for, it's your duty to bring

3

the death verdict.

4

that.

5

I don't see anything wrong with

MS. SPILLARS:

And Your Honor, to the extent

6

that I would certainly agree that those arguments based

7

on the strength of the case were not necessarily -

8
9
10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

about the duty is based on Chief Justice Stone's opinion
in Viereck, isn't it?

11
12

MS. SPILLARS:

Well, in the sense that

Viereck was not directly -

13
14

I suppose your concession

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Which did involve the very

word "duty."

15

MS. SPILLARS:

I'm sorry?

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Chief justice Stone's

17

opinion in Viereck talked about telling the jury that

18

they have a duty and condemned that.

19

why you made the concession, I think.

20

MS. SPILLARS:

That's probably

I think the concession is

21

important to get beyond the statements in isolation,

22

because -

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not just in

24

isolation.

Didn't this prosecutor constantly say this

25

case is not about Weaver, this case is larger than

were told:

4

I think several times in the closing the jurors

MS. SPILLARS:

Yes.

However, the jury was

5

also told that it was their discretion to spare his life

6

at appendix 275.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is -- I agree with you,

8

I agree with you that we should look at the whole

9

picture.

When I look at the whole picture -- I've

10

actually got a little chart that my law clerk prepared.

11

And what he did, he went through this and looked at a

12

case called Newlon and it was the same prosecutor.

13

the prosecutor was told in that case just what he

14

shouldn't do.

15

case and look what he did in that case and look at the

16

law, the whole thing, not just little bits, it looks

17

like he did an awful lot of what he wasn't supposed to

18

do.

19

And

And now if we look what he did in this

You're not supposed to give an argument that

20

vouches as the U.S. attorney that I think that this is

21

what you should do.

22

to you as prosecuting attorney of the county, the top

23

law enforcement officer.

24

law enforcement officer and I decide in which cases we

25

have the death penalty and not.

So in Newlon he says:

And here he says:

I'm talking

I'm the top

Worse than Newlon, I

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

would say.
Then what you're not supposed to do is

3

you're not supposed to tell them they're like soldiers.

4

I mean, there's Supreme Court cases that say, don't tell

5

them you're like a soldier doing duty.

6

what all these prosecutors -- a case called Byron versus

7

the United States.

8

want to impress on you, this is a war and it's

9

justifiable to kill in war.

At least that's

So in Newlon what he says is:

Here he says:

I

As in the

10

movie "Patton" and in the movie George Patton is talking

11

to his troops because they're going out in battle like

12

the soldiers.

13

soldier, you know what to do when you put your hand in a

14

pile of goo that a moment before was your best friend's

15

face; you'll know what to do; and last July this

16

defendant's face was a pile of goo.

17

And then he says:

Okay, there we are.

18

pretty emotional.

And when you're a

And then another thing you're not supposed

21

to do is you're not supposed to tell them it's their

duty to the community.

instances where you hardly even know that there's a

person called Weaver because he says:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6
7

Well, there's a brief I'm sorry, counsel.

Maybe, counsel, if you could answer that question?
MS. SPILLARS:

In Newlon, Your Honor, it was

8

a due process case which the same prosecutor tried, and

9

it was an Eighth Circuit case.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. SPILLARS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And in that -

And is that the law here?
No, Your Honor.
It's not?

Why did they

13

file -- is this brief wrong, then, the brief of the

14

former prosecutors giving the propositions that I just

15

stated and have the Supreme Court case next to each one?

16

Are they wrong, those prosecutors?

17

MS. SPILLARS:

To the extent that Newlon

18

sets out those arguments, no, that's not incorrect.

19

Those arguments were made in Newlon.

20

reasons Newlon is distinguishable.

21

were curative instructions given to the jury.

22

there were no objections made.

23

the prosecutor made the statement, for example, that,

24

I'm the top law enforcement officer, there was an

25

objection and there was a curative instruction.

However, for two

there was an objection to the Patton, but it was

overruled.

7

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Was there a curative

MS. SPILLARS:

No, there was not.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I'm looking

11

at the quote, the statement, the reference to Patton,

12

and I have to say I don't read it as imposing a duty.

13

It says what the prosecutor says is that sometimes

14

you've got to kill and sometimes you've got to risk

15

death because it's right.

16

point, at some times, you have to impose death because

17

it's right, not because it's your duty as a soldier.

18
19
20

His point is that at some

Now, where is the reference to you have this
duty as a soldier in the prosecutor's statements?
MS. SPILLARS:

There is none, Your Honor.

21

And a reasonable interpretation of that comment is that

22

he was imparting to the jury the duty to make the

23

decision, not necessarily to impose the death penalty.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

In Viereck the words were:

"This is war, harsh, cruel, murderous war."
14
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

duties of soldiers and he said:

7

raised under this Court's supervisory powers.

8

in this case there was -- out of the eight separate

10

three of them were actually objected to, two of which

11

were sustained and curative instructions were given.

12

One, it was not directly a due

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Secondly,

But you just -- that's a

13

bit inconsistent with your point that Newlon is

14

distinguishable because there were no objections at all

15

and that was the reason for the court saying this goes

16

too far to the prosecutor.

17

are objections -

18

MS. SPILLARS:

But now you say when there

In Newlon the jury was never

19

told to disregard the statements.

20

was told to disregard the statements.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In our case the jury

Certain statements.

22

There are were many objections made here that were

23

overruled.

24
25

MS. SPILLARS:
objections made total.

Correct.

There were 12

Interestingly, though, the
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defense attorney did not raise objections to the

2

majority of the comments that the Eighth Circuit found

3

improper.

4

that the defense attorney is certainly in the best

5

position to judge whether or not a comment prejudices

6

his client.

7

Now, while that's not dispositive, I think

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

To that extent the two

8

cases were the same because in Newlon there were no

9

objections either.

10

MS. SPILLARS:

No objections at all.

There

11

were no objections at all.

In our case there were 12

12

objections, so clearly the defense attorney was on the

13

mark and was listening for prejudicial comments from the

14

prosecutor.

15

16

them were objected to.

Of the eight comments that the Eighth

So assuming that the defense

attorney was -- I'm sorry.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There were two cases

cited as involving the same prosecutor?

22

also?

23

MS. SPILLARS:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Was it Shurn

Correct.
And that there was a

significant overlap in the three charges in the three

cases.

The prosecutor had been told in two of them, you

2

went too far.

3

4

offensive or would you say they're all on a par?

5

In this one, just in terms of what the

MS. SPILLARS:

I would actually -- if you

6

compare the three arguments side by side, the

prosecutor's statements were tempered in this case.

8

decision -- when he tried this case, it was

9

approximately five weeks after the district court in

10

The

Newlon had come down with the decision.

11

And there are statements that he made in

12

Newlon and Shurn that were not in this case.

13

example, in Newlon he said this is the worst case ever

14

and in Shurn he said the same thing.

15

that in this case.

16

by side comparison, his statements were actually

17

tempered.

18

For

He did he not say

So I think from -- if you do a side

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you tell us -- as

19

you know, AEDPA has the decisions of settled precedents

20

of the Supreme Court and there's the Supreme Court

21

standard, a very general standard that we can get from

22

Darden and Donnelly, although we didn't reverse there.

23

I take it that the counsel for the

24

Respondent is going to say:

Well, this is a Federal

25

standard, but the Eighth Circuit is entitled to apply
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the specificity and the application that it's given to

2

this, so the Eighth Circuit's entitled to rely on its

3

cases in reversing.

4

Do you agree with that?

5

MS. SPILLARS:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

they're going to tell us.

8

MS. SPILLARS:

9

No, Your Honor.
I assume that's what

No, Your Honor, I would not

agree.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MS. SPILLARS:

Why.

Clearly, it's not established

12

law by this Court, and this Court has not specifically

13

outlined the kind of post and beam that would result in

14

a reversal in a penalty phase Closing argument.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It says that in the text,

16

doesn't it, "clearly established by the Supreme Court"?

17

Is that not in the text of the statute?

18

MS. SPILLARS:

Correct, yes.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So those things that are

20

improper for a prosecutor to make in summing up in the

guilt phase, are they then proper to say, exactly those

22

things, in a sentencing phase with capital -- with -

cases that clearly establish law by decisions of this

18

19

such as Berger against the United States, and Viereck

20

against the United States, which were direct review of

21

Federal cases in which they say there was a denial of

22

the fair trial, but they're not setting aside State

23

cases?

Would it be proper for the Court of Appeals
to rely on those cases?

MS. SPILLARS:

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

3

No.

And this is why.
Even though those cases

say in so many words it deprives you of a fair trial.

4

MS. SPILLARS:

No.

Because of the very

5

specific nature of the supervisory powers in those

6

cases, I don't believe that in the larger context, the

7

final standards, that we can say that those directly

8

apply.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If those direct

10

Federal cases were interpreting the constitutional

11

provisions directly, they would count as established

12

law?

13

MS. SPILLARS:

Certainly, yes, Your Honor.

14

There was also no mechanism in this case for

15

the jury to apply any of the improper remarks to their

16

deliberations because they were properly instructed.

17

Instructions which we presume that they followed.

18

this case, the court read the instructions to the jury

19

before closing arguments, and a copy was also given to

20

the jury to deliberate with.

21

In

Four of those instructions, numbers 21, 28,

22

26, and 27, told the jury in various forms that it was

23

their duty, and theirs alone, to render a verdict.

24

jury was also told in instructions 23, 24, and 26 that

25

it was -- that their decision must be within the

The

2

And thirdly, within the specific process

3

laid out for finding ways -- mitigating and aggravating

4

circumstances.

5

the jury heard before closing arguments was that closing

6

arguments were not evidence.

7

And finally, the last instruction that

It is counterintuitive to assume that the

And so to

MR. BLUME:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
As the former prosecutor's brief makes

19

clear, George "Buzz" Westfall's penalty phase closing

20

argument in Mr. Weaver's case contained a number of

21

improper and mutually reinforcing statements which

22

exploited the authority of his office, analogized the

23

jury's duties to that of soldiers in war time, injected

extraneous matters into the proceedings, and appealed to

the jurors' passions and prejudice.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think they

2

overstated the significance of Viereck.

3

-- does Viereck stand, do you think, for a per se rule

4

that a prosecutor in a closing argument may never

5

mention the word soldier?

6

limited -- much more limited holding?

7

Isn't Viereck

Isn't that a much more

This was a prosecution during World War II

8

of individuals for failing to register as agents of Nazi

9

Germany, and the prosecutor said in the guilt phase -

10

and it wasn't a capital case obviously, in the guilt

11

phase of closing argument, that just as our soldiers who

12

are fighting the Japanese on the Bataan Peninsula are

13

doing their duty for the country, you have a duty to

14

return a guilty verdict against these individuals.

15

Now, isn't that very different from saying

16

that in a capital -- at the capital phase of the trial,

17

you have a duty to consider something that's very

18

unpleasant, and it's unpleasant in the same way that

19

what soldiers have to do in war time is different?

20

Isn't that very different?

21

MR. BLUME:

Which in that case,

U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

The decision that was violated

9

MR. BLUME:

Well, pick which one

Well, I think Darden established

10

the rule.

Romano, and thus the Darden rule that if a prosecutor's

12

comments, the totality -

13
14
15

This Court applied it to the penalty phase in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not Romano.

Romano was an introduction of evidence case, right?
MR. BLUME:

Yes, but logically, if you have

16

established a rule for closing arguments, you

17

established it, you then say it is applicable to the

18

penalty phase for the admission of evidence, it would be

19

completely illogical to say it didn't govern penalty

20

phase closing arguments.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My point is simply

22

the level of generality at which the guiding principles

23

were articulated, which helps when you're applying it,

24

but in determining -- it is the point Judge Bowman in

25

dissent that when you don't have a case that's close,
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you have more leeway in terms of the deference to

2

the Court, because it's not a clearly established

3

precedent of the Supreme Court.

4

Yes, there are the Jenner cases that

5

establish the general principles, but the question is

6

how clearly those were contravened before you can say it

7

violated clearly established law.

8

MR. BLUME:

9

That is what this Court's

decisions say, Chief Justice Roberts.

I think I want to

10

make clear that we have two different positions on that.

11

The first is that any State court decision finding this

12

argument in its totality based on what happened and

13

based on the weight of the evidence in this case that

14

said that didn't render the proceedings fundamentally

15

unfair would be an unreasonable application of Darden

16

and Donnelly.

17

But in addition to that, the Missouri

18

Supreme Court in this case said the decision was

19

unreasonable because it failed to consider significant

20

portions of Mr. Weaver's challenge to this argument.

21

did the analysis under a State law abuse of discretion

22

standard, and it refused to consider or failed to

23

consider several components of his claim.

improper.

And when the State court cited what he said,

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why is that improper?

2

Is it improper at the penalty phase for a prosecutor to

3

refer to the concept of deterrence, which by definition

4

is bigger than the individual whose sentence is being

5

considered?

6

MR. BLUME:

I don't think this can properly

7

be considered a deterrence argument.

When you say over

8

and over, this is far more important than William

9

Weaver, this goes way beyond William Weaver, this is

10

bigger than William Weaver, this doesn't just pertain to

11

William Weaver, then you add that in with the number of

12

comments about you need to give this person the death

13

penalty -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, could a prosecutor

15

say, one of the factors you must take into account when

They will be affected by the threat of dying.

And he says, they're not

It seemed to me he tied it very, very

anything left to your argument about his saying it's

bigger than Weaver.

MR. BLUME:

And if you say that deterrence

I think the import of this

argument is you should give the person the death penalty

further the deterrent function of the death penalty.

kill him now at another point in there.

13

you take those comments, you also look at those in the

14

context of where he goes on and on about the

consequences; you need to send a message to the drug

16

dealers, that's a huge theme -

penalty is deterrence, that would probably be consistent

with this Court's decisions.

8
9

MR. BLUME:

Okay.

Let me -- I want to back

up, and I want to take on the premise of the question.

10

Which may be a mistake, but I think in determining, the

11

first part of the Donnelly/Darden standard is you look

12

at what the prosecutor argued and whether it was

13

improper.

14

I don't believe you have to have a United

15

States Supreme Court case directly on point for

16

everything the prosecutor said on that.

17

decisions from this Court on a number of things he said.

18

There are also other touchstones, for example, the

19

standards on criminal justice which regulate what

20

prosecutors can say.

21

There are

Then the way I understand this clearly

22

established Federal law to work, is you take what the

23

prosecutor said, you examine that in light of what

24

happened, what defense counsel did, what the trial judge

25

did, and the weight of the overall evidence.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

And if you believe that the prosecutor's

2

arguments rendered the proceedings fundamentally unfair,

3

then there's a violation of the due process clause.

4

don't think I have -- you have to show that there's some

5

Supreme Court case directly on point going to each

6

particular comment.

12

case, weren't they?

13

MR. BLUME:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well So that, so that when the

15

prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging

That's quite different it seems to me from

The trial's done.

This person is guilty,

I'm not sure that you can

in determining what kind of argument is proper.

2

in the former situation when the -- if the prosecutor

3

says this is not just about this defendant, it's about

4

the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the

5

person guilty.

6

find the person guilty in order to stop drug

7

trafficking.

8
9

I mean -- and that's crazy.

Because

You don't

But you do impose a heavier penalty in order
to do that.

So I just don't, don't see the analogy from

10

the Supreme Court cases you have.

11

MR. BLUME:

Well, I think that, I don't see

12

any reason why a principle which this Court has

13

repeatedly reaffirmed that a prosecutor is not supposed

14

to leverage his opinion and the prestige of his office

15

behind a particular outcome, would apply any less at the

16

penalty phase of a capital trial than at the guilt phase

17

of a capital trial.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's different.

Look -

19

it could -- could -- would defense counsel be able to

20

argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an

ordinary trial where there's no separate phase, "ladies

Would he be allowed to argue that?

3

4

arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided

5

by what arguments the defense can make.

6

And it seems to me in determining what

The defense can surely come in and say

7

ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called

8

upon to kill somebody.

9

difficult, overwhelming thing that is?

10

Do you realize what a -- what a

And then you say the prosecution can't come

11

in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do

your duty, you have to kill.

13

you find the facts this way, that's your duty.

14

This is the law here.

If

I -- I -- I think you're, you're taking hard

15

cases very much out of context by applying cases that

16

relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure

17

that we've set up in capital cases which is called the

18

guilt -- uh, the penalty phase.

19

MR. BLUME:

Well, I disagree with that, and

20

to this extent.

Can a lawyer in a capital case argue at

21

the sentencing phase of the capital trial you should not

22

sentence this person to death because they've had a hard

23

life?

Yes.

24

that?

Because according to this Court's cases, that

goes directly to the individual's moral culpability and

Of course you can.

And why can you do

The problem with many of the arguments which

dealers around, and he's one of them.

The question has been

whether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty

The

I can

acknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't

do it.

to the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence

4

evidence in this case and the fact that the Respondent

5

had killed a Federal witness execution-style.

6

extent, as I understand the Respondent's argument, the

7

deterrence rises or falls on however the prosecutor has

8

prefaced his deterrence argument, if he says certain

9

words to mitigate the deterrence argument.

To that

However,

10

trials don't operate in terms of specific words that

11

must be pre-spoken before an argument can be valid.

12

Secondly, in response to Justice Kennedy's

13

question previously, I would advise that prosecutors

14

should not use some arguments, not necessarily the

15

deterrence argument, but not that in every instance they

16

must not use those arguments.

17

role in those kinds of cases allows this Court to turn

18

should's into must's for Federal prosecutors, but that

19

is not the case here.

20

This Court's supervisory

Second -- thirdly, the Viereck case is in a

21

historical context which we don't have here, and the

22

Missouri Supreme Court did consider the penalty phase

23

arguments.

24

specifically said:

25

arguments."

At page 237 of the appendix the court

And then at page 235, the Missouri Supreme

2

Court distinguishes Newlon and says that they do not

3

rise to the level of the statements made in Newlon.

4

to that extent the Missouri State court was not an

5

unreasonable application of this Court's precedents and

6

deference should afforded to that State court decision.

7

For that reason we would ask that this case be reversed.

8

Thank you.
