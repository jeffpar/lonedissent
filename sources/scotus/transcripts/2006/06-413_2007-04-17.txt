CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument next

Mr. Samson.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. SAMSON,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8
9

MR. SAMSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

10

The Ninth Circuit's conclusion that

11

Mr. Brown is entitled to habeas corpus relief should be

12

reversed for three reasons.

13

2254(3)(16) of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death

14

Penalty Act the trial judge's dismissal of Mr. Deal from

15

the jury is a finding of fact of substantial impairment

16

that is presumed correct unless it is rebutted by clear

17

and convincing evidence.

18

such evidence because the record before the State court

19

supports the decision to remove Mr. Deal, especially

20

since the trial judge had the opportunity to observe

21

Mr. Deal and the defense had no objection to his

22

removal.

23

First, under Section

Mr. Brown has not presented

Second, under 2254(d)(2) the State court

24

decision was based on a reasonable determination of the

25

facts.

Since the finding of fact was correct it is
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

necessarily reasonable.
And third, under 2254(d)(2), the State court

3

decision was not contrary to Supreme Court precedent.

4

Since the trial court applied the correct standard under

5

Witt and found as fact that Mr. Deal was substantially

6

impaired and this case is immaterially indistinguishable

7

from Witt, the State court's decision was a reasonable

8

application of clearly established Federal law.

9

Mr. Deal did indicate in the voir dire that

10

he could impose the death penalty and consider it, but

11

his other statements created an ambiguity which the

12

trial judge was in the best position to resolve.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Counsel, may I ask you one

14

thing, which I have assumed, and I think it is correct,

15

but I'd like to be sure of it.

16

correct, that prior to the voir dire questions, no one

17

had given a statement to the venire people of what the

18

law was with respect to the imposition of the death

19

penalty; is that correct?

20

MR. SAMSON:

Is it the case, is it

Not exactly, Your Honor.

21

to the individual voir dire, they were -- there was

22

instructions given to the jurors.

23

out of the questionnaire.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Prior

Prior to the filling

Were they told what the -

I forget how many factors are enumerated under the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Washington law?

2
3

Were they told what they were?

MR. SAMSON:

No, Your Honor, it was more a

general instruction regarding how the system operates.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. SAMSON:

6

Okay.

In the individual voir dire of

Mr. Deal -

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But one piece of

8

evidence that -- one piece of information that wasn't

9

given apparently to those jurors, they didn't know about

10

it, was that life meant life without parole.

11

when he was questioned, he was surprised, he didn't know

12

that that was the law.

13

MR. SAMSON:

Because

Your Honor, he learned an hour

14

before his questioning that that was the law.

15

not informed of that -- of tht law when he filled out

16

his questionnaire.

17

individual questioning, he was informed of that, and he

18

indicated that in his questioning that he had just

19

learned an hour ago.

20
21
22

He was

But approximately an hour before the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And how did he learn

that?
MR. SAMSON:

He learned that from the

23

instructions given by the trial judge as well as through

24

the statements by defense counsel and by the prosecutor.

25

And the defense counsel reminded Mr. Deal of
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the fact that there was life without parole.

2

him if he can consider both options, death and life

3

without parole.

4

counsel asked why do you think the death penalty is

5

appropriate?

6

questionnaire, it would be a case where the person was

7

incorrigible and would reviolate if rereleased.

8
9
10

He said he could.

And then defense

And he stated again, as he stated in his

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
example.

She asked

He gave that as an

He didn't say and that's the only circumstance

in which I be willing to vote for the death penalty.

11

MR. SAMSON:

That is correct, Your Honor,

12

but the prosecutor in viewing Mr. Deal's responses

13

through the course of the voir dire, the prosecutor

14

viewed Mr. Deal as saying the only time, or I would have

15

great difficulty in imposing the death penalty, unless

16

the person would be released and would be in a position

17

to -- to reoffend or kill again.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did he say, "for example,"

19

with regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg

20

mentioned?

21

I didn't recall that he said for example.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He was asked to give an

22

example.

23

this would be the only situation in which I would vote

24

for the death penalty.

25

He didn't say for example.

MR. SAMSON:

But he didn't say

That is, that is correct.
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Both

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

-- both are correct, Your Honors.

2

he was asked for an example of why he believed the death

3

penalty was appropriate, and he says, "I think if a

4

person is or would be incorrigible and would reviolate

5

if released, then it would be appropriate."

6

At Joint Appendix 62,

And, in fact, the only two examples he ever

7

gave of when he believed it would be appropriate is when

8

a defendant wants to die or a defendant would be

9

released on parole and could kill again.

And the

10

prosecutor specifically asked Mr. Deal, can you think of

11

an example, or a situation of when you would be able to

12

impose a death penalty now knowing there is life without

13

parole, and Mr. Deal at Joint Appendix 71 to 72 said I

14

would have to give that some thought.

15

until an hour ago I did not realize that life without

16

parole was -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Like I said up

Would you agree that if we

18

grant your position and grant you relief, that it would

19

be something of an extension over Witt and Darden, in

20

that the jurors in Witt and Darden had fixed views, that

21

they were as a matter of conscience opposed to the

22

penalty?

23

MR. SAMSON:

Your Honor, I would agree that

24

the statements given by the jurors in Witt and Darden

25

were not exactly what Mr. Deal said.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

But I think the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

general rule that the deference given to the trial judge

2

would be the same rule.

3

court to apply the rule.

4

And we are only asking this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I understand that.

But I

5

do think that the views of this juror, Deal, were

6

somewhat more equivocal than in the cases I've

7

mentioned.

8
9

MR. SAMSON:

They were, Your Honor.

There

was not a statement as in Witt and Darden where the

10

jurors said that they had an opposition to the death

11

penalty and would have difficulty applying it.

12

correct.

13

That is

The statements were -- were different.
And certainly if the judge viewing a juror

14

of this type determined that the juror was not impaired,

15

then that decision would also be entitled to deference.

16

In fact, an example occurred in this case, Juror Obeso,

17

the judge -- there was a challenge by the prosecutor.

18

There was actually an objection by the defense.

19

judge said Mr. Obeso says that he can follow the law and

20

impose the death penalty and I think he can.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the

One thing I couldn't

22

clearly discern from your brief is the significance you

23

attached to the defendant's, defense failure to object.

24

How does that enter into our analysis?

25

MR. SAMSON:

Your Honor, there's two points
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

made from the failure to object.

2

explains why there's no evidence, expressed evidence

3

regarding demeanor or credibility or even an express

4

statement regarding demeanor or credibility or even an

5

express statement as to substantial impairment.

6

The first is it

The second is that as the Court stated in

7

Witt, it is a significant factor the court may consider

8

in its evidence that show the judge acted appropriately.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me on that

10

point that the State is somewhat surprised and

11

whipsawed.

12

reached the issue.

13

I take it the prosecutor had some peremptories left?

14
15

And I understand that the Washington court
It is not independent State ground.

MR. SAMSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

The

prosecutor had two.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How late in the process

17

was -- was Deal considered?

18

jurors or one of the late jurors?

19

MR. SAMSON:

Was he one of the early

He was one of the -- the early

20

jurors.

He was on November 3, which was about five to

21

six days into the individual voir dire on the death

22

qualification.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

This was about a 17 day

voir dire?
MR. SAMSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And -

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that cuts a little

3

bit against the peremptory.

4

the game the prosecutor might not have exercised the

5

peremptory.

6

MR. SAMSON:

I mean, if it was early in

Well the peremptories were not

7

exercised until the death qualification and the other

8

for-cause checks are were done.

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh, I see.

So the whole

jury is -- I see.

11

MR. SAMSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

So they, they

12

completed all the death qualification.

13

jurors that that remained they had further individual

14

voir dire, and the defense and the prosecutor then used

15

their peremptories interchangeably to remove jurors.

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And then those

May I go back to the

17

Chief's question about the failure to object?

18

got the impression from Judge Kozinski's opinion that he

19

thought that the Washington Supreme Court found that

20

with respect to two out of the three jurors at issue

21

that there had been a finding that they were

22

substantially impaired, but with respect to this juror,

23

that the Washington Supreme Court seemed to rely on the

24

failure to object as the principal explanation for their

25

decision.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

I think I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. SAMSON:

I would -- I would disagree

with that, Your Honor.

3

The -- the State Supreme Court on page 171a

4

of the Petitioner's appendix specifically was citing to

5

Witt and the rules from Witt.

6

rule that the trial judge's exclusion of a juror

7

constitutes a finding of fact.

8
9

And that includes the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought

Justice Stevens's articulation of Judge Kozinski's

10

opinion was exactly right but I thought you would in

11

response cite us to page 208a where the Washington

12

Supreme Court said that those jurors' views, including

13

Mr. Deal, would have prevented or substantially impaired

14

their ability to follow the court's instructions and

15

abide by their oaths as jurors.

16
17

It seems the court of appeals judge
overlooked that.

MR. SAMSON:

21

They did, Your Honor.

They

And that is a specific finding of fact by the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it a finding?

It's

22

listed under "Summary and conclusions."

23

"Findings," I thought under "Findings" the -- the

24

findings were that he misunderstood the standard.

there?

3

"From the facts, I conclude that he would be impaired."

4

But the impairment is the conclusion from what facts?

5

And what other finding of fact was

Because this one is listed under conclusions.

MR. SAMSON:

It is from all the facts that

6

the State Supreme Court had before it.

It's

8

the facts that were before the court.

11

were to say that is not a finding of fact, it contains

12

with it the implicit finding of fact.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And even if this Court

Well, aren't we obliged

14

under AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable

15

conclusion from the facts?

16

MR. SAMSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So even if it is just a

18

conclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a

19

totally unreasonable conclusion, right?

20
21
22

MR. SAMSON:

That's exactly right, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the point stands that

23

the court of appeals was just incorrect in, in, in not

24

noting what's there too late.

25

summary of what the Washington Supreme Court did.

It's just not a fair

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SAMSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Ninth

2

Circuit found that the State courts made no Finding of

3

fact and, as Mr. Brown has essentially admitted in his

4

response brief, there are two State court findings of

5

fact, one by the Washington Supreme Court and one by the

6

trial judge.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this something

8

particular under Washington procedure, this summary and

9

conclusions section at the end of the opinion?

10

MR. SAMSON:

No, Your Honor.

I think this

11

is more just the style of the justice who wrote the

12

opinion and how he writes his opinions.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

I take it your position is

15

that if the State courts had made or had expressed no

16

conclusion other than the final conclusion that he is

17

impaired, that that conclusion itself would be entitled

18

to AEDPA deference if the record could be read to

19

support it; is that correct?

20
21
22

MR. SAMSON:
Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your

The AEDPA JUSTICE SOUTER:

If that's the case, then

23

AEDPA deference is more than deference, isn't it?

24

deference has reached on your view the conclusion that

25

if there is any factual support in a record, the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

AEDPA

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

ultimate conclusion of the court will be upheld, whereas

2

I thought AEDPA deference went to factfinding and to

3

express conclusions that the court drew.

4

MR. SAMSON:

Your Honor, we're not saying

5

that there will never be a case where the deference

6

given to a trial judge and the deference given to a

7

State court in factual determinations can be overcome.

8

Certainly, it's hard to think of one, but there can be a

9

case where that deference could be overcome.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Isn't this perhaps just

11

such a case?

12

of the State is based only on the written record, so it

13

does not get any benefit of observing the demeanor of

14

the witness -- I mean, the demeanor of the prospective

15

juror; isn't that correct.

16
17
18

Because this finding by the Supreme Court

MR. SAMSON:

It is correct the State Supreme

Court JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if we disagreed and

19

thought there was not evidence in the written record

20

that would support that conclusion, we should not give

21

deference to that appellate court finding.

22

MR. SAMSON:

Your Honor, but the appellate

23

court finding also was based on the trial court finding

24

of fact, and the State Supreme Court recognized, as this

25

Court did in Witt, that deference must be given to the
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

trial judge, who did have the opportunity to observe the

2

juror.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

conclusion about demeanor.

5

demeanor, did he?

6
7

MR. SAMSON:

He didn't say anything about

No, Your Honor, and neither did

the -

8
9

But the trial judge made no

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If we're going to get -

that takes -- it seems to me it takes deference yet one

10

further step.

11

nothing on the record about demeanor, we are supposed to

12

assume that a trial judge drew a conclusion based on

13

demeanor.

14

that's simply imputing fiction.

15
16

We're saying that even if there is

I mean, that is not deference.

MR. SAMSON:

I mean,

Your Honor, there's no evidence

on demeanor because the defense counsel did not object.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why is it the defense

18

counsel's obligation to object?

19

the State is objecting, saying I want this juror

20

removed, and the trial judge is saying, okay, I will

21

remove him, that there is an obligation to make a

22

record.

23

MR. SAMSON:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

It seems to me that if

Your Honor Wouldn't there be?

I guess

my point is if there isn't, then in effect you are
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

making the defendant responsible for creating a record

2

to support what the other side asks for.

3

MR. SAMSON:

Your Honor, as this Court

4

explained in Witt, when there is no objection or no

5

dispute as to the factual issue in the trial court, the

6

judge has to reason to elaborate on his finding and

7

therefore he has no obligation to do so.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that means that the,

that the argument for sustaining the trial judge's

10

action on the ground that the trial judge could observe

11

demeanor in effect is the elimination of judicial review

12

on that subject, because we know that if the venire

13

person was present in the courtroom and the judge was

14

present in the courtroom, the judge probably looked at

15

him, and if that is enough to sustain judicial action on

16

the grounds that we defer to demeanor then there's no

17

judicial review at all.

18

Kozinski said.

19

MR. SAMSON:

I think that's what Judge

Your Honor, if there is

20

absolutely no evidence to support the trial judge's

21

conclusion in the record -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

I'm talking about demeanor.

24

understand it on the record about demeanor.

25

MR. SAMSON:

I'm talking about demeanor.
And there's nothing as I

Yes, Your Honor.
16

Alderson Reporting Company

In Marshall

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

versus Lonberger the Court said there is no requirement

2

for explicit finding as to credibility.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if there is no

4

requirement that there be anything on the record about

5

demeanor, then there is no judicial review on that point

6

at all, is there?

7

MR. SAMSON:

Not on demeanor, but there can

8

be judicial review on the other facts that are presented

9

in the record.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course there is on

11

demeanor.

12

the case that the burden is on the habeas applicant to

13

show that demeanor did not make the difference?

14

the burden on him to show that it was an unreasonable

15

determination.

16

I mean, I suppose, to begin with, is it not

MR. SAMSON:

It's

It is the burden on him to

17

present clear and convincing evidence.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the question -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And secondly, he could

20

present such evidence if he showed that there was

21

absolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements

22

said, so that demeanor could not have made a difference.

23

But in a case where the statements are seemingly

24

contradictory or arguably contradictory, demeanor is

25

very relevant and it's the burden, it seems to me, of
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Petitioner to show that demeanor wasn't what made

2

the difference.

3

And besides which, wasn't there some part of

4

the record that you referred to where he said "and I

5

believe him"?

6

MR. SAMSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's as to

7

a different juror when there was an objection, and

8

because there was no objection there was no obligation.

9

If I may -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is there any way that he

11

can show that demeanor didn't make a difference when the

12

record is absolutely silent on demeanor?

13

way he can show that?

14

MR. SAMSON:

Is there any

Your Honor, he could attempt to

15

bring evidence in a State court collateral -- he

16

actually filed a motion for reconsideration as to

17

another juror.

18

He did not do that in this case.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask to be sure I

19

understand the record, because I did miss something

20

before.

21

Deal's views would have prevented or substantially

22

impaired his ability to follow the court's instructions

23

and abide by the rules of the jurors?

24
25

Did the trial judge say in so many words that

MR. SAMSON:

The trial judge made no such

express finding because there was no objection raised.

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

MR. DREEBEN:

How do we

Justice Stevens, this is a

record in which the trial judge showed that he was

meticulously careful in applying the standard from

Wainwright versus Witt.

believe at pages 7 through 9, there's an extensive

discussion of how the judge is going to apply the Witt

5

standard evenhandedly.

jurors who are like-biased.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He's going to eliminate

Does that respond to the

possible suggestion that Judge Kozinski made that what

10

he really did was act on the basis of no objection,

11

rather than on the basis of a finding that he failed to

12

make?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think so,

14

Justice Stevens, because it's very clear that he told

15

the parties, if you have any question, if you have any

16

problem with any of the objections that are made, speak

17

up and I will intervene and question the juror myself

18

and clarify it.

19

And this is a judge who, against the

20

background of the entire voir dire, clearly was making a

21

good faith effort to apply the Witt standard.

22

were 12 objections by the prosecution to various jurors

23

that they should be excused for cause because of

24

inability to apply the law as Washington gives it.

25

defense objected, I believe, to seven of those; and the
20
Alderson Reporting Company

There

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prosecution lost on five of those occasions.

2

So the judge basically went with the defense

3

when the defense spoke up and objected.

4

jurors that were excused over the defense objection.

5

The transcript is also in the voir dire on those and it

6

shows that the defense objected and said these jurors

7

can apply the standard under the law, and the judge

8

found that they could not and excused them.

9

There were two

In the case of Juror Deal there is no

10

absolutely reason to believe that the judge wouldn't

11

have done exactly the same thing if the defense had

12

objected.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what is -- I know,

14

Justice Breyer; just on this point.

15

actually volunteered "no objection."

16

MR. DREEBEN:

The defense

Said "We have no objection."

17

And I think that this is one of the three significant

18

legal errors that the Ninth Circuit made in disposing of

19

this challenge.

20

versus Witt that the absence of a defense objection is

21

very critical in assessing whether a judge's implied

22

finding of bias is to be upheld on appeal.

23

the reason that my colleague mentioned in part:

24

judge is not asked to give a fuller explanation, there

25

is no reason -

This Court made clear in Wainwright

JUSTICE BREYER:

What has this to do with

2

the -- aside from the explanation, when I read through

3

the transcript, as I have, it seemed to me in the

4

transcript he didn't say a word that suggested he's

5

against giving the death penalty.

6

in special circumstances, not always.

7

into this thing where he's been thinking of a person who

8

will in fact commit a crime again.

He kept saying yeah,
Then they get

Have you thought about that he won't be

13

He says:

You're right; I hadn't really thought

I want to know, thinking it through, could

14

you consider the death penalty?

15

conditions where the man would never get out again you

16

could impose it?

Death penalty?

Then could you impose it?

I could

I could if I

And it's absolutely clear he's not thinking

of the repetition.

It is clear he is thinking that it's

some kind of a mean.

25

it with this other case, Gray, and they say it's illegal

And I compare that with Witt,

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to push him off a jury, a woman who is confused, and

2

finally she says:

3

I think I could.

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, I think your

4

question goes to the heart of the case.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

Well, that's probably

right.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

But the reason it goes to the

8

heart of the case, Justice Breyer, is that you and I and

9

every other appellate lawyer and judge who have looked

10

at this is dealing with a cold record, but the only

11

person who actually saw and heard this juror give the

12

responses was the trial judge.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is it that he could

14

have done?

Was he shaking, making faces?

15

shaking his head to indicate he believed the opposite?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Was he

Well, Justice Breyer If something like that

18

happened, isn't a prosecutor of any sense going to say,

19

I want it noted for the record that the witness while he

20

said these words was chortling inwardly or something

21

like that?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Breyer, there

23

were five separate occasions during Juror Deal's voir

24

dire in which he expressed either uncertainty or a

25

misconception about what the death penalty should be
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

exposed for when measured against Washington law.
And the overarching point that I make before

3

I talk about those five instances is that this is a

4

record in which there is confusion and uncertainty about

5

whether Juror Deal really can adhere to the law.

6

those circumstances, the only judge who can truly

7

resolve that and determine whether he should be credited

8

is the trial judge.

9

over and over again in describing its voir dire.

10
11
12

And in

And this Court has made that point

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If there is confusion, is

that grounds for excluding him?
MR. DREEBEN:

Confusion alone is not.

If

13

it's confusion it must rise to a level of preventing or

14

impairing the juror's ability to follow the law.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But even at this point,

16

this juror, he doesn't know anything about aggravating

17

circumstances.

He doesn't know about mitigating

18

circumstances.

He hasn't been told what the standards

19

of -- that it was beyond a reasonable doubt.

20

And to say that he should be criticized

21

because when he was asked to give an example he said one

22

thing and not another, it seems if you just read the

23

transcript, that there's nothing disqualifying.

24

you said, everything is the weight falls on the

25

demeanor, which an appellate court can't review.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

So as

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that that's right,

2

Justice Ginsburg.

3

judicial review at all, in response to Justice Souter's

4

question and I think the concern underlying your own.

5

There has to be fair support in the record for the

6

conclusion that the trial judge could have resolved the

7

question of a juror's competence to sit in the way that

8

he did.

9

It doesn't mean that there is no

And if you had a record in which everything

10

that juror said was consistent with complying with State

11

law, which I don't think this record is, and the

12

prosecutor objected, and the judge says granted, and

13

there's no explanation, I think that would be difficult

14

to uphold, even if it is possible that everyone in the

15

courtroom knew that the judge was relying on demeanor.

16
17
18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is there anything in this

record to indicate that the judge did rely on demeanor?
MR. DREEBEN:

What is -- no.

There's

19

nothing explicit.

But this Court has said over and over

20

again that there does not have to be because in this

21

case, in particular, since there was no objection, the

22

judge did not elaborate on his reasons at all.

23

Court has gone further in Witt and in Darden and

24

building on cases like Patton versus Yount, and made

25

clear that it is implicit in a judge's action in
25
Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

response to an objection that he has relied on the

2

totality of the law and his observations.

3

And here there were two instances during the

4

defense colloquy in which the juror specifically said

5

that his example of when the death penalty is

6

appropriate is a circumstance when somebody is

7

incorrigible and will reoffend if released.

8

three times during the prosecution's voir dire, he

9

volunteered, first of all, that it would have to be in

And then

10

my mind very obvious that the person would reoffend.

11

And this was a particularly significant answer because

12

it wasn't given in response to a death penalty question,

13

it was given in response to whether he could apply the

14

reasonable doubt standard to the crime.

15

He again comes back to the reoffend notion

16

after having State law explained to him again, and said,

17

could you consider imposing the death penalty, he said I

18

have to give that some thought.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But he had not been given,

20

as I understand it, the explanation of what the -- I

21

keep saying nine factors.

22

factors were.

23

had he?

24
25

Whatever the enumerated State

He had not been told that at any point,

MR. DREEBEN:

No, but I think the important

point, Justice Souter, is that under Washington law
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there were really two alternatives, life without parole

2

or death.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but the -- the

4

questioning was what grounds are you going to look to

5

make that decision; and he had not been instructed on

6

Washington law on that at all.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

The concern that I think the

8

prosecutor had and that the judge accepted is that this

9

juror's vision of when capital punishment is appropriate

10

is when somebody will get out and kill again.

11

that analysis, you would never impose capital punishment

12

under Washington law, because the defendant is never

13

going to get -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And under

But doesn't it follow that

15

his limited cases, the views about when the death

16

penalty is appropriate would translate into views of

17

whether he could or could not impose the death penalty

18

if instructed properly by the court?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

20
21
22
23

Justice Stevens.

Not -- not automatically,

I mean, this is an juror -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Doesn't it have to be

automatic in order to justify the result in this case?
MR. DREEBEN:

No.

What has to be the case,

24

and this Court in Witt made clear it is not going to

25

apply an unmistakable certainty requirement, is that the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge has to conclude that juror's views would prevent

2

or substantially impair juror in applying the law.

3

the judge had to make a call based on what he saw and

4

what none of us did, of whether this juror's views -

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

Isn't there a world of

6

difference, at least it has been my experience in trials

7

like this of what a juror will do on his own and what he

8

thinks the law might be, and what is fair, and so forth,

as opposed to what a, the juror will do in response to

10

proper instructions?

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

6

MS. ELLIOTT:
please the Court.

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

There were in our view two findings by the
Washington courts here.

The first by the trial court is

10

objectively, an objectively unreasonable determination

11

of the facts in light of the evidence presented, and

12

thus the writ should be granted under 50 -- 28 -

13

2254(d)(2)?

14

I'll get to a moment to where I think their decision is,

15

in the record, which conflicts with the State's view of

16

where that is -- was an unreasonable application of this

17

Court's controlling precedent in Witt versus

18

Witherspoon.

19

And the supreme court's decision -- and

And I would direct the Court to, in terms of

20

the State Supreme Court's finding, to page 173a of the

21

appendix of the Petition for certiorari.

22

of course, first like to start with the actual record in

23

this case.

24
25

But I would,

In this case, the Washington State trial
court's decision to excuse juror Deal for cause was be
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

objectively unreasonable based upon the record, because

2

juror Deal said many times on the record, when presented

3

with the question of whether or not he could impose the

4

death penalty under the sketchy view he had of

5

Washington State's statutory capital punishment scheme,

6

that he could do so.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that's the

8

beginning of the questioning, isn't it?

9

end of it.

It is not the

It is surely not the law that just, whenever

10

a juror says sure, I'll follow the instructions, that

11

he's automatically -- has to be seated?

12

MS. ELLIOTT:

No, Your Honor.

But it went

13

beyond that.

14

very question was put to him by the prosecutor.

15

that you know that in Washington, if you find the

16

defendant guilty, you're only going to have two choices,

17

the death penalty or life in prison without the

18

possibility of parole, could you still consider under

19

the appropriate evidence imposing the death penalty?"

20

And Mr. Deal said, "I could consider it.

21

And at page 73 of the joint appendix, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

"Now

Yes."

After several times

22

saying the only time he would consider it is if the

23

person is going to reoffend.

24

the right answer once out of six times and it's the last

25

time, is the judge required to ignore the prior

I mean, if he just gets

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. ELLIOTT:

No, Your Honor, but I don't

3

think he only said it once out of those times.

Kozinski identified in his opinion six times, and those

5

are found on the record of proceedings at page 62, at

6

page 72, and again at page 73.

7

asked, and one time he was asked first I'm going to ask

8

you if you could consider it -- this is on page 72 and

9

then I'm going to ask you if you could impose it?

And he was repeatedly

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But look at page -

14

appropriate?

If the person would reviolate if released.

MS. ELLIOTT:

MS. ELLIOTT:

18

that was the example he gave, but he didn't say but I'm

20

never going to do it, if he -- if my only choice is

21

death or life in prison.

22

And I think that the State's reading of the

voir dire here actually expands both the objection made

penalty if the only choice is life without and the death

penalty, I think that would be problematic under

3

That's the reading

5

the State gives his voir dire but it's not there.

Because that would prevent him from making the decision

that Washington requires.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you -- you -- you

insist that he come out and say in so many words, I am

going to be an unreliable juror.

the way it happens.

12

whether indeed he's shading the truth a little bit and

13

whether, in fact, he will be impaired in his service.

And some of these -- some of these answers suggest that.

15

And it, it is not an easy call to simply say well, you

other records and other cases cited by the State here,

in fact, trial judges have made records of those kinds

22

of situations, which are not present here.

On two points I don't go as

far as Judge Kozinski.

7

there has to be some deference to implicit findings; let

me clarify that, and I know the State has pointed that

9

out.

10

One, I believe that actually

I think Judge Kozinski's language was a little

loose there.

11

I think he probably agrees with me.

As to the -- the failure to object, first of

12

all, if the court says, first of all, are there any

13

objections; now again we have admitted that what he said

14

was I have no objection.

15

law, the prosecutor, the judge, and the defense attorney

16

all knew that this issue could be raised for the first

17

time on appeal.

18

But the --

under Washington

The prosecutor -- and I'm not saying on

19

habeas review, but in the trial court, a challenge for

cause, the burden falls on the prosecutor to articulate

21

a basis.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's fine.

But,

23

but competent counsel knows that getting something

24

overturned on appeal is a lot harder than getting it

25

done right the first time.

And he also knows that if

right.

3

I can't imagine why if he thought this

Where -- where are you

MS. ELLIOTT:

I'm quoting from page 675.

Which is Mr. Matthews -

Matthews' objection.

Which

And the court makes

cause.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And incidentally the court

12

did not say are there any objections?

13

say that.

14

MS. ELLIOTT:

The court did not

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

15

court says -- uh -- the bailiff will excuse you.

16

Counsel, any challenge to this particular juror?

says is we have no objection.

That's

And then what Mr. Mulligan

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
say is there an objection?

The

Well, but the court didn't
So you're incorrect.

21

MS. ELLIOTT:

I'm sorry.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So Now on the that,

23

just the language you just focused on, on page 75, if

24

that was correct, you disagree with it, but if if the

25

court concluded that the juror had not overcome the idea
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that he must kill again before imposing the death

2

penalty, that would be a sufficient basis for excusing

3

him?

4

MS. ELLIOTT:

Under Washington law, I think

5

there would be a sufficient basis for excusing juror

6

Deal if he said I now know what the statutory scheme is,

7

and only if there's some possibility for release of

8

Mr. Brown and the opportunity for him to kill again,

9

would I impose the death penalty.

10

We know that would prevent him from imposing

11

Washington's statutory scheme because once finding him

12

guilty, the juror will never be released again.

13

possibility of release would not be there.

14

would reject the notion that you must consider

15

mitigating factors if there's no possibility of release.

16

So the

And so he

We argue in our brief that that's not what

17

he said.

And in fact, Juror Deal was a thinking juror,

18

a juror who could, in fact, consider all of the options.

19

We disagree, of course, with the prosecutor's summary

20

that this concern about recidivism was somehow central

21

or pivotal to Juror Deal.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

imposed the death penalty in this case?

24

MS. ELLIOTT:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You think he could have

Yes.
What's the harm then in

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

replacing him, from your standpoint?

2

MS. ELLIOTT:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The harm?
You're complaining about

4

the excusal of a juror who by your own submission would

5

impose the death penalty.

6
7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Because you don't know

him.

8
9

So why am I here?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I would like to hear the

answer.
MS. ELLIOTT:

My answer is because it's a

11

constitutional issue and this juror could also have

12

considered the mitigating circumstances that would have

13

been proposed by the -- at that stage that were clearly

14

on the table for argument in front of the jury at the

15

penalty phase.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You, according to this

17

structural error, so you have a death case, and so you

18

have this kind of error you don't have to prove.

19

MS. ELLIOTT:

Under Gray versus Mississippi,

20

I don't have to -- Mr. Brown does not have to prove that

21

it's harmless.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then you're zeroing

23

in on this particular juror and the colloquy, but

24

shouldn't we look at the entire proceeding of the

25

jurors, including that there were -- what was it 39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

seven attempts by the prosecutor to have a for cause

2

excusal?

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There were actually 12, I

4

think.

Weren't there 12 objections by the prosecution?

5

I was going to ask, we've already destroyed the rebuttal

6

time of your colleagues, but it seems to me that this is

7

a large number of challenges by the prosecutor.

8

comment on that?

9

seven, and five objections were sustained.

10

12?

Can you

I can't say in the vast

extraordinary or not.

Thank you.

MS. ELLIOTT:

I didn't count on a daily

In a quality case in Washington, 17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it does seem that

this trial judge was doing a conscientious job.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official - Subject to Final Review

granted five of the -- rejected five of the

2

prosecutor's, and how many of those had been where

3

defense counsel had objected?

4

MS. ELLIOTT:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

He objected in seven and

in five of those -

7
8

I think seven.

MS. ELLIOTT:

No.

He objected to 12, and

seven of those were granted, that's my understanding.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not No.

objections.

MS. ELLIOTT:

I think the

I'm sorry, Your

I misunderstood your question.
So yeah, I don't disagree that this Court

16

should look at the entire record of voir dire, and I

17

don't disagree that Judge Martinez is a conscientious

18

trial judge.

19

granted the challenge for cause to this juror, he did

20

not and he could not find that this juror was

21

substantially impaired.

22

prevented from following Washington law.

The problem in this case is that when he

He could not -- he was not

23

The -

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

In your view, do we

look at this any differently through AEDPA than if we
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

were looking at this on direct review?

2
3

MS. ELLIOTT:

Well, yes.

I mean, you have

to view it through the lens of the statute.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that makes a

5

difference in the standard of review that we apply in

6

this case?

7

MS. ELLIOTT:

Well, there is -- prior to the

8

enactment of AEDPA, there was -- this Court said you

9

give deference to the trial court's findings.

AEDPA

10

has, of course, codified that deference by saying that

11

the trial judge has to be objectively unreasonable based

12

upon the facts developed at the trial court level.

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, does that mean

we give a greater degree of deference?

15

MS. ELLIOTT:

I don't think this Court has

16

said what, on balance, what the difference between the

17

kind of deference that was required under Witherspoon

18

is, as laid against the kind of deference now.

19

clear Congress wanted to provide a substantial amount of

20

deference to the trial court and limited habeas review

21

of State court decisions.

22

out in his opinion in this case, that didn't mean that

23

they were going to completely eliminate Federal habeas

24

review.

25

It's

But as Judge Kozinski pointed

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
42
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm just trying to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

get a handle on your view as to whether the standard of

2

review with respect to deference to the State court is

3

different in this respect than it would be on direct

4

review?

5

MS. ELLIOTT:

Yes.

I think under habeas

6

review, it's a more substantial review, because we have

7

to show not only that the findings were unreasonable but

8

they were objectively unreasonable, which I think is a

9

different standard than saying you give deference to the

10

trial court.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask, one of the most

12

troubling parts about this case is the failure to

13

object.

14

doesn't making any difference, the review is exactly the

15

same as it would have been if there had been an

16

objection.

17

constitutional law, should it make a difference?

18

As I understand, under Washington law, that

But under our review as a matter of

MS. ELLIOTT:

I don't think so.

I think

19

it's one of those peculiarities of Washington law that

20

you should give respect to, but it is essentially

21

meaningless in the context of this case, because all the

22

parties knew this case was going to be reviewed and

23

reviewed.

24
25

I mean, there's automatic appellate review.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you have any response

to Justice Kennedy's concern that this really allows for
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a mouse trapping of the trial judge who very likely

2

would have paid less attention to the issue as long as

3

any counsel doesn't object, just as a realistic way that

4

this kind of thing is handled?

5

MS. ELLIOTT:

Well, I respect his concerns

6

about bushwhacking or mouse trapping, but the fact of

7

the matter is that that's Washington law and the judge

8

was well aware of it, as were the parties.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let me put it to you

10

this way:

There's no demeanor finding here.

11

the judge had made a demeanor finding.

12

different, the case would be a different case, wouldn't

13

it?

14

MS. ELLIOTT:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose

That would be

Yes.
And if the objection is

16

what prevents the demeanor finding, then maybe we should

17

be able to consider the fact there was no objection,

18

even though Washington law doesn't require it before we

19

consider the issue.

20

MS. ELLIOTT:

But there's nothing in the

21

record that says that the reason that the judge didn't

22

mention the demeanor, or the prosecutor who made the

23

objection didn't mention demeanor.

24

to me that if demeanor had been a concern based upon the

25

answers given by the juror here, and because the
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Certainly, it seems

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prosecutor had the laboring oar at the trial court to

2

provide a basis for the challenge for cause, he would

3

mention it.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought your

5

brother made the point that there was a more elaborate

6

explanation of the trial judge's determinations when

7

there had been an objection.

8
9

MS. ELLIOTT:

I do believe that he had a

more lengthy explanation where there were objections.

10

But whether or not that would have -- there was

11

something in the demeanor of this particular judge here

12

that he simply didn't mention, it can't be found here.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but he said for one

14

of the other witnesses, I just don't -- I don't believe

15

him.

16

presumably would have said the same thing.

17

And if that had been his problem here, he

MS. ELLIOTT:

Well, presumably then, he

18

would have said that in response to the prosecutor's

19

objections, which was not that we don't believe that

20

Juror Deal could be credible.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not if there's no opposing

22

objection by defense counsel.

23

part of his reason for granting the motion to strike the

24

juror was demeanor, he mentioned demeanor.

25

MS. ELLIOTT:

When there was, and when

That's correct, and here he

didn't.

2

the objection on the basis provided by Mr. Matthews,

which was incorrect both under Washington law and under

the facts developed in the voir dire.

So I think the assumption was, he was granting

through some but not read them all, as I'm sure you

different than irrevocably committed.

MS. ELLIOTT:

Well, it's substantially

ability.

13

And this juror never CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You would agree that

14

substantially impaired is not the same as irrevocably

15

committed?

16

MS. ELLIOTT:

Yes, I would agree, because

17

you could say I favor the death penalty, as this juror

18

did, and still sit on the jury.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

This doesn't say -- that's

20

one of the things it says.

But the other is, "the most

21

that can be demanded of a venire man is that he be

22

willing to consider" -- that's the word that's

23

italicized -- now, is there any -- "and if you exclude

24

him on a broader ground than that, the death sentence

25

cannot be carried out".

Now, is there anything in any
47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

later case that suggests a change in that respect?

2

MS. ELLIOTT:

No, Your Honor.

In fact, the

3

cases affirm that.

4

precisely the kind of juror that I think was appropriate

5

to sit.

6

And in fact, this juror was

What he said was, I can consider.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, he said that, but

7

elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider

8

it unless it were a situation in which this person would

9

be able to commit the crime again.

10

MS. ELLIOTT:

But none of those statements

11

indicated he would be prevented from voting for the

12

death penalty, or that he was substantially impaired

13

from doing that.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They did indicate that

15

unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider

16

imposing the death penalty.

17

what they indicated.

18

MS. ELLIOTT:

I think that's precisely

Well, if it means only that he

19

would consider the issue of future dangerousness, it

20

wouldn't prevent him under Washington law.

21

under Washington law, first of all, the presumption is

22

for life.

23

whether or not a person would recidivate is both an

24

aggravating and a mitigating factor.

he's concerned about reoffense is perfectly appropriate.

said, if this -- unless this guy is going to be released

important.

I'm going to use it in the opinion.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It's a very

If I can get back to my

10

concern about the failure to object again.

11

this defense counsel instead of just saying no

12

objection, said no objection, I think he's a hanging

13

juror?

14

MS. ELLIOTT:

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Supposing

I think he's a hanging juror?
In other words, he thought

16

contrary to the prosecutor, his appraisal of this man

17

was that he's going to be pro-death penalty, and he let

18

that be known.

Would that make a difference?

19

MS. ELLIOTT:

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21
22

under Washington law.

Well, I think that I don't think it would

I don't suppose it would.

MS. ELLIOTT:

Well, if the juror said -- it

23

would make a difference under Morgan if the juror said

24

I'm not going to consider any mitigating factor.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, no.

49
Alderson Reporting Company

The juror just

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did what he did, but everybody was evaluating his

2

demeanor in the courtroom, and defense counsel's

3

evaluation was to mean I don't want that juror, he's

4

going to hang my client, and that's what he thought and

5

he let it come out when he told the judge no objection.

6

MS. ELLIOTT:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

Oh.
Would that make a

difference?

9

MS. ELLIOTT:

It wouldn't make a difference

10

under Washington law because it could be raised for the

11

first time on appeal, yes, if that wasn't what the

12

record demonstrated.

13

Did I understand your question?

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You did.

Do you think it

15

should make a difference to us if we think that he

16

didn't really want this guy on the jury?

17

MS. ELLIOTT:

I don't think there's anything

18

in the record to suggest that, but for lack of his

19

objection.

20

I don't think it can make a difference to this Court,

21

and because in Washington we have this peculiar rule

22

which says you don't have to object.

23

Because there's no harmless error analysis,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does the fact that this is

24

structural error, that there's no harmless error

25

analysis, mean that we should be very careful to give
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

substance to the rule that there's deference to the

2

trial judge?

3

that the determination to excuse a juror is based on

4

determinations of demeanor and credibility that are

5

within the trial judge's province.

6

And in fact, in the Witt case, we said

MS. ELLIOTT:

We said that.

Absolutely.

And if there had

7

been a mention of demeanor on this record, I think this

8

Court's decision would be easy.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What presumes that there

10

is that judgment made by the district judge, whether or

11

not it's mentioned?

12

It was not mentioned in Witt.

MS. ELLIOTT:

Well, what Judge Kozinski says

13

about that is if on the record -- you have a cold record

14

here which demonstrates in our view that the juror is

15

completely qualified to serve, and nothing about him

16

would prevent him from serving.

17

of demeanor by the trial judge, but speculation on the

18

part of the prosecution, then all substantive evidence

19

review of juror challenges in capital cases is dead and

20

--

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you have no mention

Should defer to Judge

Kozinski's observation or to the Supreme Court in Witt?
MS. ELLIOTT:

You should defer to the

24

Supreme Court's observation in Witt, but only I think if

25

there's some indication on the record that there is
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

demeanor.

2

And CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there's a

3

third choice which under AEDPA is the Washington State

4

court decision to which we should defer.

5
6

MS. ELLIOTT:

The Washington State Supreme

Court decision?

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MS. ELLIOTT:

9

Yes.

The Washington State Supreme

Court decision suffers a different problem, I think,

10

Your Honor, which is that what the Washington State

11

Supreme Court said on page 173 was that on voir dire he

12

indicated he would impose the death penalty where the

13

defendant, quote, "would reviolate if released," which

14

is not a correct statement of the law.

15

that is -- the considerations about whether or not

16

Mr. Brown would reviolate whether in prison or not are

17

considerations under Washington law in a death penalty

18

case.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in fact,

On page 208, though,

20

the Washington Supreme Court also stated the standard,

21

as I understand it from Witt, that Mr. Deal's views

22

would have prevented or substantially impaired his

23

ability to follow the court's instructions.

24
25

MS. ELLIOTT:
summary that says that.

But -- I agree that there is a
But the substantive basis for
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the trial court' decision I think is back at page, as I

2

said, 173a, where he -

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't the number of the

4

page that you gave telling this is an appeal from a

5

capital sentence, and there are umpteen challenges made.

6

So the judge is dealing with Richard Deal in one

7

paragraph.

8

and so there's not perfect consistency with what these

9

two passages in the opinion.

The defendant raised a host of challenges,

But mustn't we take into

10

account what this was?

It was the defense brought out

11

every objection they probably could conceive of and they

12

didn't put particular emphasis on this, so it comes out

13

this way.

14

MS. ELLIOTT:

15

terms of the -- in the trial court?

16

Supreme Court decision?

17

Well, if you're -- you mean in

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Or in the State

In the Supreme Court.

18

Now we're talking about the Washington Supreme Court.

19

You said they got it wrong because they said in this

20

paragraph that he got the law you wrong, he made an

21

incorrect statement of the law because he said he would

22

impose the death penalty where the defendant would

23

reviolate if released, which is not a correct statement

24

of the law.

25

We don't know exactly what that court meant
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

by that paragraph, but we do know that the Washington

2

Supreme Court was basing -- I don't know how many

3

objections they were dealing with in this opinion, but a

4

great many.

5

MS. ELLIOTT:

Yes, and so if you then turn

6

to the end of the opinion, if that's what you're asking,

7

at 208, there's kind of a summary of their basis for all

8

of the challenges made by Mr. Brown to all sorts of

9

things in the case.

10

There were also challenges to other jurors

11

as well.

12

court -- those jurors that are mentioned in the summary

13

paragraph, where the court then explains the various

14

reasons why it's upholding the trial judge as to those

15

jurors as well.

16

And there are separate paragraphs where the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, my point is simply

17

that where the court is faced with so many challenges,

18

this particular one, there had been no objection at the

19

trial.

20

to spend too much time on that one.

MS. ELLIOTT:

So an appellate court might think we don't want

That is true.

It appears as

22

though what they did was to, because this is not what

23

the trial judge said, this is the basis for the

22

automatically vote against it by unmistakable clarity.

23

The standard instead is the substantial

In addition, the arguments presented by

6

Mr. Brown are essentially:

We disagree and the Federal

7
