ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. FISHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Complaints alleging violations of the FCC's

11

pay phone compensation regulations allege just that,

12

violations of regulations.

13

not give rise to private cause of action under section

14

206 and 207 of the Communications Act.

15

of departure in this case begins at section 276.

16

Congress directed the FCC to create a system guaranteeing

17

pay phone providers compensation for the services that

18

they provide to callers who make dial around calls.

19

There can be little doubt that the FCC has ample

20

authority to enforce the system it created

21

administratively.

22

The regulatory violations do

The proper point
There

But nothing in Section 276 or anywhere else

23

in the Act contemplates that violations of the FCC's

24

implementing regulations should give rise to a private

25

cause of action for damages in Federal court.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Accordingly, this Court should reverse the Ninth

2

Circuit's decision allowing pay phone operators to bring

3

through the back door the kinds of cases that Congress

4

declined to allow through the front.

5

There's nothing upsetting about reaching

6

that result here.

The Communications Act quite sensibly

7

limits private damages actions in Federal court to those

8

alleging violations of the Act itself.

9

long distance providers -- I'm sorry -- claims that long

And claims that

10

distance providers have violated the pay phone

11

compensation regulations require the parsing and the

12

application of the extraordinarily complex and

13

ever-changing FCC rules and regulations and orders.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Fisher, may I ask you this

15

question?

In your view, did the regulations create a

16

legally enforceable obligation?

17

MR. FISHER:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19
20

Yes, Justice Stevens.
And where may that obligation be

enforced?
MR. FISHER:

Our position is that can be fully

21

enforced in the FCC.

22

complaints like this all the time.

23
24
25

And in fact, the FCC is hearing

JUSTICE STEVENS:

By means of a private action

before the FCC?
MR. FISHER:

Yes, by means of an administrative
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

action before the FCC.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Where the carrier -- where they

3

would file a complaint saying you owe us X dollars, and

4

the agency could order them to pay X dollars.

5

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

And if you look at the

6

Sprint amicus brief at page 23, the brief cites several

7

cases just like this one that the FCC has fully

8

adjudicated and in some cases awarded damages.

9
10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

enforceable in State court?

11
12

MR. FISHER:

No, we believe -- of course, this

Court did not grant certiorari -

13
14

And is the obligation

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I understand that.

I'm curious

to know what your view is.

15

MR. FISHER:

If this Court holds there is no

16

private cause of action in Federal court, then it is not

17

enforceable in state court either.

18

there is only an administrative remedy that's available.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Our position is that

But the administrative remedy

20

that you just conceded is a counterpart to a private

21

right of action, or isn't it?

22

thing?

23

-- the pay phone provider wasn't paid, and X under the

24

commission's regulations was supposed to pay it.

25

complained against X.

Would you get the same

I complained to the agency, and say, I didn't get

So I

Could I get before the FCC exactly
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what I could get in court, so that we're only talking

2

about which form is proper, or is there a difference in

3

the remedy?

4

MR. FISHER:

In terms of damages, we're talking

5

about exactly the same thing, Justice Ginsburg.

The only

6

difference between being in Federal court as opposed to

7

the agency is that if you're in Federal court, the

8

Communications Act has a fee shifting provision.

9

think that further underscores the Congress's scheme

And we

10

here, which is to reserve Federal court actions for

11

serious violations of the Communications Act, and that's

12

where fee shifting kicks in.

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ordinary -

And before the agency, you

don't get counsel fees?

15

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Fisher, I realize you don't

17

concede, in fact, quite to the contrary, you deny that

18

the failure to pay the full rate is -- could be

19

considered a practice here.

20

sake of argument that it is a practice within the meaning

21

of the text.

22

But let's assume for the

If the -- if the agency had explicitly said, what

23

we are doing here in defining this practice as unlawful

24

or unjust, is to define it as such within the meaning of,

25

what is it, 201(b), so they make explicit reference to
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the statute and they say, we are fleshing out the

2

statute, would your position be the same?

3
4
5
6

MR. FISHER:

I think that's very much what the

Commission is contending here Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER:
as that?

7

MR. FISHER:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10

But it wasn't textually as nice

Right.
But they have made it that,

haven't they, in a later regulation?

Haven't they said

just that.

11

MR. FISHER:

In a later order, Justice Scalia.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In a later order, yes.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let's assume in the reg itself,

14

they were that precise.

15

the same?

16

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

Would your position be exactly

The result would be the same.

17

And I think you're asking me to put aside for the moment

18

whether the FCC was correct in saying it was a covered

19

practice.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

MR. FISHER:

Sure.

And in terms of the FCC calling this

22

unjust and unreasonable, the problem with that is that

23

the only reason the FCC has ever given that this is

24

unjust and unreasonable is because it violates its

25

regulations.

And if there's one thing we know from the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

structure of the Communications Act, it's that for

2

something to be remedial in Federal court, in other

3

words -- and if we know something violates 201, it is

4

remediable.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

It has to be.
You invite me to change the

8

hypothetical, then, by jacking it up in this respect.

9

The FCC gives the reason.

And it says, the reason it's

10

unjust and unreasonable is that the carriers are getting

11

a free ride on the pay phones, et cetera.

12

So they fill in the gap that you claim.

13

They have a reason.

14

still be the same?

15

MR. FISHER:

Would your answer or your position

Yes, because the reasoning the FCC

16

would give simply would not be a permissible construction

17

of the terms unjust and unreasonable in 201(b).

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are there any times under any

19

circumstances that you can think of in which the FCC can

20

adequately and validly define a practice as unjust and

21

unreasonable within the meaning of the statute so that,

22

in fact, in applying the statute, we would follow -- be

23

bound to follow the regs?

24

MR. FISHER:

25

Of course, in the vast majority.

Let

me give you some examples, and then I'll distinguish it
8

1

from this case.

2

regulations that the FCC can pronounce.

3

say how much long distance companies are able to charge

4

for certain services.

5

can charge so that they're not in effect gouging

consumers is a regulation that this Court could look to,

7

but -

8
9

The easiest example is rate of return

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So the FCC can

Fleshing out the amount that they

Okay.

But why can't they pass a

regulation that says don't gouge pay phone operators?

10

MR. FISHER:

Well, that goes to the heart of this

11

case, Justice Souter, in the kind of regulations that we

12

have.

13

distance providers to give pay phone operators money that

14

long distance operators ought to owe pay phone operators.

15

What we have here is not the FCC telling long

The money that's at issue here, the 24 cents per

16

call is the money that callers owe the pay phone

17

operators.

18

decision -

19

If you look back at the D.C. Circuit's

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, do they?

I mean, the

20

statute of the United States says that -- I think I'm

21

correct -- the statute of the United States says they

22

can't be required, the caller cannot be required to put

23

in the quarter in order to get the 800 number and so on.

24
25

So as a matter of law, don't we have to say that
the, in practical terms, the caller doesn't owe?

Somebody owes.

2

facility.

3

Somebody ought to pay for the use of this

But Congress has said it is not the end user.

MR. FISHER:

You are right, Justice Souter,

4

insofar as we're trying to capture the money here for

5

essentially the equipment rental or the access fee that

6

the caller is availing himself of.

7

said that money cannot rest on the caller's shoulders.

8

All Congress says in Section 226 is that the caller

9

cannot be required to pay in advance.

10

But Congress has not

The FCC during its rulemaking proceedings actually

11

considered two alternatives where the caller would have

12

paid in full compliance with Section 226.

13

the caller paying with a later billing device like a

14

credit card, billing it to their home phone number.

15

One would be

Another option the FCC considered would have been

16

where the long distance providers would have billed

17

customers on behalf of the pay phone operators.

18

way, the customer would have paid.

19

in his brief openly -

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Either

Even the respondent

Well, the customer is going to

21

pay if, in fact, the long distance carrier is the one who

22

has to make the immediate payment, because that payment

23

is going to be figured in the long distance rate.

24

that ultimately, the end user is going to pay for the

25

service he gets, and Congress is simply saying, the way
10
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

to make this thing work in a sensible and simple way is

2

to require the long distance carrier to make the

3

reimbursement.

4

The economic end result is exactly the same as it

5

would have been if they had said, well, you can send a

6

bill for 25 cents to the end user.

7

MR. FISHER:

The economic result may be the same,

8

but with all due respect, Congress has not decreed that

9

the administrative system work this way.

10
11
12

JUSTICE SOUTER:
otherwise.
MR. FISHER:

It hasn't decreed otherwise.

13

Congress essentially -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15
16

It hasn't decreed

Isn't that the classic situation

in which agencies are supposed to figure out what to do?
MR. FISHER:

Congress gave the FCC power in 276 to

17

come up with a plan.

18

decided it is not under 276, it is under 201, so the

19

question is whether failing to comply with the

20

administrative plan -

21

But this case, as the Ninth Circuit

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, as I understand it, it came

22

to the conclusion not that they were not acting under

23

276, but that, in fact, the cause of action has to refer

24

back to 201.

25

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

I'm sorry.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

It brings

Official

1

us back to the question that you asked:

2

Ninth Circuit, or the FCC for that matter, can shoehorn

3

this into 201 as an unjust and unreasonable practice.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Whether the

In your answer for why

5

they can't, Justice Souter's comment is a classic, this

6

is what administrative agencies do all the time in

7

typical rate regulations.

8

utility shareholders have to bear this cost.

9

payers can bear this cost.

They make a determination that
The rate

And at the end of the day, it

10

is a determination that a rate is reasonable or

11

unreasonable.

12

And it seems to me that that is just what is

13

involved here.

14

about how to allocate who has to collect the rates, and

15

whether they can pass them on or not makes it an

16

impermissible interpretation of what's unjust or

17

unreasonable under 201.

18

I don't know why their determination

MR. FISHER:

Well, Chief Justice Roberts, the FCC

19

was unquestionably acting under 276 when it did this.

20

the question is whether you can go back to 201.

21

said, you need to start with section 206 and 207 because

22

we're in Federal court.

23

the Act are remediable but not of regulations, in

24

contrast to numerous other sections.

25

So

And as I

And that says that violations of

So the question in asking whether it violates 201,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it has to be something more than simply the FCC's

2

regulation wasn't followed.

3

what kind of regulation is it.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we need to ask ourselves

Are rate making regulations

5

issued under 201, do they purport to be the FCC's

6

definition of what is just and reasonable compensation?

7
8

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

to Justice Souter earlier.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. FISHER:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

That's what I conceded

They are issued under 201.

I think largely they are.
So they are an interpretation of

the statutory language in 201.

13

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. FISHER:

And you say this one is not.

That's right.

And this Court can

16

look several places, but it can first look to

17

these -- this regulatory regime that was created, which

18

was always thought of as being triggered by section 276.

19

And then asking -

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you say it was always

21

thought of as being triggered by 276, did the FCC

22

reference 201 in issuing its determination that a failure

23

to follow these regulations was unjust and unreasonable?

24
25

MR. FISHER:
201.

In its order, it references 276 and

In the regulations -- I thought I was being asked
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about the regulations -- it leads with 276.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose it issued the regulation

3

after notice and comment, and said -- violation of the

4

pay phone order is an unjust and unreasonable practice,

5

would the case be different?

6

MR. FISHER:

No, it wouldn't be.

And I think I

7

want to flesh out and make sure I've gotten across the

8

distinction between the rate making -

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

You haven't. Maybe -- if this

10

doesn't clarify it.

11

question.

12

if the AT&T were charging them too much, I think everybody

13

would say that the FCC can say, hey, that's too much.

14

owe them 2 cents a call refund, and everybody would agree

15

that the people who are hurt could go into court and bring

16

a lawsuit and get the 2 cents.

17

201(b).

18

I think everyone has about the same

You have a bunch of pay phone operators.

And

Right under 47 U.S.C.

Now, the only difference here seems to be that it

19

wasn't AT&T that was charging, in my example, too much.

20

They weren't paying what they owed.

21

paid what they owed.

22

201(b), an unreasonable practice.

23

and collect it in court.

24

that?

25

You

They should have

And that, says the FCC, is, under
And, therefore, go in

Now, what is the answer to

So far I have heard nothing that suggests
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that this couldn't be an unreasonable practice under

2

201(b), which is just what the FCC said it was.

3

what's wrong with what I said?

4

focus you upon what I think is the question that's

5

bothering some of us.

6

MR. FISHER:

Now,

I'm simply trying to

There are two things that are wrong

7

with that, Justice Breyer.

The first thing is that in

8

contrast to ordinary rate making regulations, here, in

9

the absence of regulations, long distance providers would

10

owe pay phone operators zero.

11

distance providers would give money to pay phone

12

operators.

13

There's no reason why long

The 24 cents here is to capture what callers

14

owe the pay phone operators.

15

with an administrative system.

16

unjust or unreasonable about long distance providers not

17

giving money to pay phone operators before the regulatory

18

regime drops into place, whereas there is plenty that is

19

unjust and unreasonable about overcharging, for example

20

--

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so the FCC has come up
But there's nothing

So, my answer -- not answer, but

22

my characterization of what you have just said is that the

23

FCC did say it was an unreasonable practice.

24

view, it was not an unreasonable practice not to pay.

25

But in your

And you want us to go back and second-guess, which
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we could, if their view of unreasonable practice is

2

unreasonable itself.

3

overturn it.

4

about, but are you saying now that that's the issue?

5

They said it was an unreasonable practice not to pay this

6

money, you think it is a reasonable practice not to pay

7

the money.

8

do.

9

And I guess you would have to

I didn't know that was what the case was

There is a dispute.

MR. FISHER:

No.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. FISHER:

12

the Ninth Circuit.

13

That's what we should

Okay.

Then what should we do?

Well, what you should do is reverse

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You say it would be a reasonable

14

practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of

15

the regulation.

16

MR. FISHER:

That's exactly right.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just like AT&T when, in fact --

18

or any other utility that, in fact, runs into situations

19

every day of the week, where but for an FCC regulation,

20

they would not be overcharging, because they have a way

21

of doing it that isn't on its face unjust.

22

writes some regulations and now it is unjust.

23

to take that argument would overturn, I guess, about a

24

hundred years of rate making law.

25

MR. FISHER:

But the FCC
So I guess

Wouldn't it?

No, it wouldn't.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Justice Scalia, I

Official

1

think, has captained that position.

2

saying is the FCC can pick a fair rate once it is

3

something that long distance providers or any common

4

carrier ought to be compensating somebody for.

5

we are saying here is, this is a purely administrative

6

creature.

7

And what we're

But what

And then it gets to the second reason why -

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in other words, you are saying

8

-- I think it is common that the FCC might write some

9

accounting rules, for example.

And they might say,

10

before these accounting rules, Mr. Bell's system in San

11

Francisco, you could charge people 8 cents a call.

12

given the way we set up the accounting rules, we think

13

this month you have to do 7 cents in the first six

14

months, 7 cents, in the next six months, 9 cents.

15

any deviation from that is unreasonable.

16

does deviate.

17

deviate, they are behaving unreasonably, and someone who

18

pays too much could go into court and get money back.

And

And the company

I would have always thought when they do

19

Am I wrong about that?

20

MR. FISHER:

No, you would have been right,

21

Justice Breyer.

22

Public Service Commission is another example of

23

something.

24

back to what -

25

But

We're not asking -- even the Louisiana

And that brings me -- I think I should go

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before you go back, let's hear
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

about the accounting rules.

2

under?

3

What would they be issued

Would they be issued under 201?
MR. FISHER:

They might.

The question that we

4

would ask is whether it affects carriers' relationships

5

to their customers.

6

hypothetical, and this is the Louisiana Public Service

7

Commission -

8
9

Now, under Justice Breyer's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me accounting rules

-- in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you

10

have to have accounting rules.

11

fit very comfortably under 201.

12

MR. FISHER:

So the accounting rules

I don't think we're disagreeing.

13

What I want to do is distinguish those from the case we

14

have here, and go back to Justice Souter's -

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I focus your return to me?

16

Because I want to take up with where your answer to

17

Justice Scalia left off.

18

saying that the rate in this case is unreasonable because

19

the party or the person who is responsible for the use of

20

the pay phone facilities is the person who's making the

21

call, not the long distance carrier.

22

As I understand it, you were

My question to you is, isn't that simply a choice

23

of characterization?

Because another way of looking at

24

it would be that the person who makes the call wants to

25

use long distance facilities to get to the person he
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Why then isn't it just as fair to characterize the

use of the pay phone here as for the benefit of the

MR. FISHER:

No, for two reasons.

The first is --

12

I just want to be clear, we are not challenging the FCC's

13

authority to have created the regulatory regime it did

14

under 276.

15

long distance providers to be on the ultimate hook here.

So the FCC could well have picked, as it did,

I lost the train of thought in your

JUSTICE SOUTER:

My question is simply, you can

20

say -- one way of looking at this transaction is, it is

21

the guy making the call who's using it.

22

to say the long distance facilities carrier is using it

23

to get the call to the long distance facility.

24

look at it in way B, doesn't your argument for

25

unreasonableness disappear?

Another way is

If you

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

That would be an entirely

2

different case than the one we have here, Justice Souter.

3

The 24 cents that the respondent is seeking to recoup

4

here, if you go back and look at the regulatory system --

5

and that's what they are asking for, is the 24 cents that

6

the FCC regulations entitle us to -- was calculated -- in

fact, the D.C. Circuit made the FCC go through this

8

exercise three times to get it right.

9

that 24 cents, it is purely a function of the amount of

money that the caller owes the pay phone operator.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

What difference does that make?

12

What difference does that make?

13

of a value of 24 cents.

14

is a value not only to the caller, but to the long

15

distance provider who couldn't provide anything to the

caller without the pay phone?

characterization just as easy, regardless of how they get

to 24 cents?

MR. FISHER:

The use of the phone is

But the value of using the phone

Why isn't the alternative

I think another way to perhaps

20

characterize your position is, why is this like a

commission that they are seeking.

22

23

If there was such a commission that could exist, it would

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Excuse me, but aren't you arguing

2

with the 24 cents, as opposed to creating an argument

3

about what is the proper characterization of the

4

transaction?

5

MR. FISHER:

I don't think so.

All I'm saying is

6

if you started with trying to compensate pay phone

7

operators for the service they provide -- that you're

8

characterizing as the service they provide to long

9

distance carriers, you end up with a far different

10

number.

end up with zero.

23

such scheme as this.

24
25

And in the case of the pay phone, the pay

MR. FISHER:

Right, but then we're back to the

rental income question, and the question of whether it
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

would be unjust or unreasonable for long distance

2

providers, absent the regulations, to be the ones paying

3

that rental income.

4

And the answer, we submit, is no.

And the problem

5

that I think we've gotten off on a couple times brings us

6

back, I think, to the assumption you asked me to make at

7

the beginning of the argument, that something is a

8

covered practice under the Act.

9

And so another way to understand the distinction

10

between the accounting rules, the rate making exercises

11

and all the rest in this case is that section 201(b) of

12

the Act doesn't cover everything in connection with a

4

5

affect rates and service to customers.

6

And that's the core of 201(b), which says that when

Here -- and with accounting and

What we have in this case is something very

7

different.

This is a carrier-carrier relationship.

you need to look somewhere else.

10

physical interconnections between carriers.

11

problem with that argument, and the reason why this falls

12

outside 201(b), even if it is somehow unjust and

unreasonable, is that the carrier-carrier relationships

14

are governed only when the FCC has ordered physical

15

putting aside 276, it would clearly be impermissible for

customers use pay phones; and, therefore, we're setting

up this rate regime in connection with that service.

MR. ENGLERT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
It is not particularly unusual for the grants of

10

authority in the FCC -- to the FCC throughout the

11

Communications Act to be enforceable through the

12

provisions of section 201(b) barring unjust or

13

unreasonable charges, classifications, rates, or

practices.

Would they be prescribed under section 201?

be prescribed under section 220, which is the provision

And that's what's happened here.

It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked

9

into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to

10

obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a

11

nullity.

12

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, Your Honor, first of all, the

13

FCC has never argued, and we have never argued that all

14

FCC regulations are enforceable through a private right

of action.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

Failing to comply with an FCC regulation is unjust.

20

Violation of an FCC regulation is unjust.

MR. ENGLERT:

No, no, Your Honor.

The phrase

unjust or unreasonable is a classic phrase delegating to

22

the administrative agency the authority to make the

23

determinations in the first instance of what's just and

whether the violation of that regulation rises to the

3

order of unjust or unreasonable.

There are also examples of things

22

23

24

be sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and

25

contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as
28

the FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is,

2

in our view, unjust.

3

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, Your Honor, let's start with

4

statutory text.

5

action for anything in this Act declared to be unlawful.

6

Section 201(b) says unjust or unreasonable

7

classifications, practices, et cetera, are declared to be

8

unlawful.

9

text between 201(b) and 206.

10

Section 206 says that there is a damages

So we have a very precise match in statutory

Now, what Mr. Fisher's argument amounts to is to

11

say that if it is covered in a regulation, it is exempted

12

from being called an unjust or unreasonable charge,

13

classification, practice, et cetera, because that would

14

allow the FCC to enforce too much.

15

the text Congress enacted, there is a precise match

16

between 201(b) and 206.

But if we start with

And to say that that which the FCC hasn't
regulated is more subject to judicial review JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

25

some other scheme.

Some regulations do

It could have been

That's

fine.

5

do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any

6

violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.

7

But to say that it would be unjust for them not to

MR. ENGLERT:

Your Honor, our position doesn't

8

require us to argue that it would have been unjust for

9

the FCC to adopt some other scheme.

Our position is that

10

once the scheme is in place, it is unjust to depart from

11

that scheme in the way Global Crossing did, just as once

12

a scheme of rate regulation is in place, even though

13

there could be many different schemes of rate regulation,

14

it may be unjust or unreasonable to charge a higher rate

15

than that.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the rate regulation is -- is

17

established in order to determine what reasonableness and

18

justness requires.

19

MR. ENGLERT:

And 276 is something quite different.
I respectfully disagree, Your Honor.

20

276 is, asks -- was a delegation by Congress to the

21

agency to fill in the details of a plan to make sure that

22

pay phone service providers were fairly compensated, a

phrase not very different from just and reasonable, for

unreasonable, that is, it has to focus on it, make that

11

determination.

12

13

it can't just call anything unjust and unreasonable -

That that -- if you have that

unreasonable.

21

I would have thought your answer

And you don't need

22

was talking about with Mr. Fisher earlier, which is

23

whether or not this is such communication service under

24

25

that the agency gets deference on.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

But it would seem to

Official

1
2

me, that's where the limitation would come.
MR. ENGLERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me address

3

the interplay between 201(b) and 201(a), because Mr.

4

Fisher has simply misunderstood our position.

5

We cited the second half of section 201(a) not to

6

say it applies of its own force here, but to say that it

7

disproves the contention that the communications services

8

referred to in the phrase such communications service in

9

201(b) have to be limited to carrier-customer relations,

10

because 201(a) isn't limited to carrier-customer

11

relations.

12

Yes, all 201(a) does of its own force is allow the

13

prescribing of through routes and interconnections.

14

there is no possible way to read 201(b) as limited to

15

carrier-carrier communications in light of the full

16

breadth of practices covered by 201(b).

17

reason to cite 201(a) is simply to disprove Mr. Fisher's

18

contention about the limits on 201(b).

19

But

So that's the

The phrase such communications service is actually

20

used in 201(a) and in 201(b), and the antecedent in the

21

first few words of 201(a), the such communications

22

service, is interstate or foreign communication by wire

23

or radio.

24

either carrier-carrier or carrier-customer relations, but

25

such communication service relates back to all

So 201(b) isn't necessarily restricted to

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

communication by wire or radio, which is what we have

2

here.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but wait.

4

5

6

7

It says to furnish such communications service, is
And they don't furnish such

MR. ENGLERT:

No, but -- well, that's debatable,

8

but what 201(b) refers to, in any event, is in connection

9

with -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. ENGLERT:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

Such communications service.

Right.
And I would think that would mean

such communications service that was furnished.

14

MR. ENGLERT:

Well, they have furnished a

15

communications service to a customer, not to us, but to a

16

customer.

17

communications service.

18

Souter earlier touched on, the caller pays sooner or

19

later.

20

So again, this is connected with that
And as the colloquy with Justice

Under the FCC's regulatory scheme, and in part

21

because of the prohibition on advanced caller payment in

22

226(e)(2), what happens is the long distance carrier gets

23

24

action to make them give it back.

25

world would look quite different without a regulatory

scheme, but it would not be a regulatory scheme in which

2

they get all the money they are currently purporting to

3

keep.

4

Now, Mr. Chief Justice, you also asked a question

5

about the flash point on whether the FCC was improperly

6

or suspiciously commenting on the scope of the private

7

right of action as opposed to interpreting a substantive

14

have something brought within the scope of 201(b), after

15

the application of traditional tools of statutory

16

construction with Chevron deference, the private right of

17

action follows automatically under 206 and 207.

18

The controversy is over the scope of

It is not a matter of the FCC reaching out to say,

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is

23

right, but that's also why I guess I don't regard it as

might agree.

12

the consequence.

13

their business, because 208 is the provision under which

14

each and every one of those Commission proceedings cited

15

in the Sprint brief, which Mr. Fisher alluded to, has

16

proceeded before the agency.

17

requires a violation of the Act, so it is very much their

18

business to decide whether these pay phone controversies

19

state violations of the Act.

20

Commission has absolutely no power to proceed under 208,

21

which is the only provision under which any

22

administrative proceeding has ever gone forward.

23

But they construed 201(b) and commented on
And this is quite important, that it is

208, just like 206,

If they don't, the

There are some arguments made here that they

24

clearly have the authority to proceed administratively

25

even if you can't go to court, but Mr. Fisher hasn't

Alderson Reporting Company

1

identified the source of that authority.

2

identified in the brief are section 4(i), which has been

3

problematic, and others -- and other sections on which

4

the FCC has never relied on in this setting, and some

5

kind of divination of an action within Section 276

6

itself.

7

And the sources

The question was put at one point to Mr. Fisher,

8

could the FCC mandate fee-shifting as part of this

9

administrative remedy it's going to create.

Well, if you

10

read 276 broadly, it's giving the Commission great powers

11

to create administrative remedies, notwithstanding 208,

12

which was supposed to be the administrative provision,

13

then maybe anything goes.

14

from the statute that Congress wrote and giving the FCC

15

awfully expansive powers to construe 276, while also

16

denying the FCC rather mundane powers to construe rather

17

ordinary phrases of administrative law, "unjust or

18

unreasonable," in 201(b).

19

But we're getting awfully far

Now, with respect to the question of whether this

20

is a practice in connection with a communications

21

service, Mr. Fisher argues strenuously that it is not.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just be sure I understand

23

your argument on 208.

You're saying that 208, like the

24

earlier provision of the statute, requires a violation of

25

the statute, not just regulations, in order for there to
37
Alderson Reporting Company

4

be an administrative remedy.
MR. ENGLERT:

Yes, Justice Stevens, and section

207 expressly gives the complainant a choice of forums.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

So the same statutory

5

requirement for the remedy that your opponent challenges

6

is the one he acknowledges is available.

7

MR. ENGLERT:

That's correct, and in fact, Global

8

Crossing -- Global Crossing went so far as to argue

9

before the Ninth Circuit that there is no administrative

10

remedy, that there's simply nothing to do except get

11

fines under sections 502 and 503, and has reversed its

12

position before this Court.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you should be arguing,

14

then, that we should give Chevron deference to the

15

Commission's interpretation of Section 208.

16

do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.

17

MR. ENGLERT:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. ENGLERT:

And once we

I'm happy to make that argument.
I thought you should be.

With respect to the question whether

20

practices are limited to carrier-customer relations, I've

21

already touched on that by talking about the interplay

22

between 201(a) and 201(b).

23

approach for that issue, which is that in the Louisiana

24

Service -- Louisiana Public Service Commission case, this

25

Court was asked to draw the inference, just as it has

But there's another angle of

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

been in this Court, from other provisions in the

2

Communications Act, that those phrases always refer to

3

carrier-customer relations.

4

And the Court said, no, that phrase can also refer

5

to depreciation rules, so it's not limited to

6

carrier-customer relations, the inference from other

7

provisions of the Act doesn't flow.

8

there are words of limitation when those words, "charges,

9

classifications, rates or practices" are used in those

And the reason is

10

other sections that make it clear that they apply only to

11

tariffed services.

12

in 201(a) and 201(b) -- or in 201(b), excuse me.

13

You find no such words of limitation

Now, there remains the argument that there's a

14

mismatch between section 201 and the relevant regulations

15

because the regulations apply to intrastate as well as

16

interstate calls, and section 201 applies to interstate

17

or foreign communications.

18

That argument appears for the very first time in

22

FCC's ability to regulate jurisdictionally mixed

23

communications depend on factual determinations, factual

24

determinations neither the agency nor even the lower

25

courts have ever been given a chance to make.

It wasn't made to the

And that's a problem, because the limits of the

But had this issue been raised in a timely

2

fashion, I suggest that it would have been appropriate

3

for the FCC to reach intrastate as well as interstate

4

communications because long distance -- dial-around calls

5

are overwhelmingly long distance, overwhelmingly

6

interstate, and it is difficult to sort out which calls

7

are which.

8

FCC underwent in this case largely were because of the

9

difficulties of keeping track of particular pay phone

In fact, the seven years of rulemaking the

calls.

Why is it so

Sorting one call from one carrier

sorting 100 calls from a carrier that has a relationship

18

with you is not difficult.

But when you go from a PSP to an inter-exchange

2

Now, the judgment below could be explained

3

on the alternative ground that a violation of the

4

regulations constitutes a violation of section 276.

5

Before I even get to the substantive discussion, let me

6

respond to the absolutely groundless claim that that

7

argument has been abandoned.

8

bunch of cases involving section 1291 appeals in which

9

people didn't appeal a particular order after final

10
11

Global Crossing cites a

judgment, and says that's an abandonment of the claim.
That's both correct and irrelevant.

This is

12

a 1292(b) appeal and there is no final judgment on any

13

claim in this case, certainly not on the 276 claim, so my

14

client certainly hasn't abandoned it.

15

My client was also a party to Greene and lost

16

Greene and has argued the merits of the section 276

17

position all along.

18

rights-creating language that creates a concrete monetary

19

entitlement, focuses on the party benefitted, and does

20

not have an aggregate focus.

21

try to defend the Ninth and D.C. Circuits' reasoning that

22

the statute does not contain rights-creating language.

23

That leaves the tricky question whether a

24

violation of the regs can be deemed a violation of the

25

Act itself when Congress specified only the right, but

On the merits, section 276 contains

Global Closing doesn't even

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

didn't specify what fair compensation was, and didn't

2

specify who had to pay the compensation.

3

In that respect, I think Alexander v. Sandoval,

4

though it's been cited against us repeatedly, is actually

5

helpful to our position.

6

talk about a violation of the regs separate from a

7

violation of the Act, and that a Congress that intends an

8

Act to be enforced intends the regulations filling out

9

the Act to be enforced.

That case says it's meaningless

10

I think the theory of Chevron itself is also

11

helpful to our position in this regard, because the point

12

of Chevron is that the use of broad language constitutes

13

an administrative -- a delegation of authority to the

14

administrative agency, not just to fill in details, but

15

to give definitive content to a statute whose direct

16

content is less than definitive.

17

So it is perfectly appropriate to talk about this

18

statute, section 276, and its rights-creating language as

19

ordering the FCC not just to create a plan, but ordering

20

the FCC to create a plan that has a particular goal such

21

that violation of that goal can be deemed a violation of

22

section 276 itself.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

4
5
6

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
There is no dispute in this case that under

7

sections 206 through 208 of the Communications Act, a

8

party damaged by any violation of the Communications Act

9

may bring an action either in Federal court or before the

10

Commission to obtain damages.

11

before the Commission under the kind of standard primary

12

provision of the Act that deals with damages, 208, and

13

207 mentions it as well, the scope of the action before

14

the Commission and before the court is exactly the same.

15

The scope of the remedies

Now, because petitioner's -- therefore, if --

16

well, because petitioner's failure to pay fair

17

compensation to respondent was an unjust or unreasonable

18

practice -

19
20
21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me just ask this.

Is it the

same with respect to fee-shifting?
MR. FELDMAN:

No.

The Act in 207 -- I believe

22

it's 207 -- specifically says that you may, the court may

23

award attorneys' fees in an action in court.

24

provide that -- there's no similar provision for actions

25

before the Commission.

It doesn't

But the scope of the kind of
43

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

thing that Congress decided that a complainant could

2

bring either to the Commission or to court is exactly the

3

same.

4

There's no way to drive a wedge between them.
There are other provisions of the Act, as Mr.

5

Fisher said, where Congress specifically authorized the

6

Commission -- an action before the Commission for

7

damages.

8

Mr. Fisher cited are in section 226, which do not have to

9

do with common carriers.

But those are -- those provisions which

They have to do with automatic

10

dialing, with do-not-call lists, with things like that,

11

where the person who's violating it is definitely not the

12

-- never going to be a common carrier.

13

In those provisions, Congress found it necessary

14

to say, okay, we have to now give you the authority to

15

create a damage action.

16

But in other provisions, where you are dealing

17

with common carrier, 206 through 208 provides Congress's

18

determination of what the scope of a damage action should

19

be either before the Commission or before a court.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you have a position on

21

whether or not Chevron deference is owed to the

22

Commission's determination of whether or not their action

23

creates or gives rise to a right of action?

24

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There are two different,

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it seems to me, two different Chevron questions.

2

is the deference on its interpretation of what's unjust

3

and unreasonable.

4

or not they have anything to say about whether that means

5

there is a private right of action in court.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

The one

The other is the question of whether

I think that -- I guess we don't

7

have a position on whether 276, independent of 201, would

8

be sufficient to have a prior right of action under 206

9

through 208.

But as for 201(b), once -- the FCC does

10

certainly gets deference, has gotten deference for a

11

hundred years for its determination of what is an unjust

12

and unreasonable practice.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's never gotten

14

deference, at least I guess from this Court, on whether

15

or not there is or is not a right -- whether there is a

16

right of action to enforce its regulations.

17

MR. FELDMAN:

No, and I don't think the FCC here

18

is claiming that there's a right of action to enforce its

19

regulations.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, but they're certainly

21

entitled to deference as to whether an administrative

22

action can be brought under 208.

23
24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct, and that's why under

-JUSTICE SCALIA:

Once you say that it can, then a
45

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court action can be brought under 206.

2

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.

So you think we don't owe them

4

deference for 206, but we do for 208.

5

deference for 208, 206 automatically decides itself.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

And if you give

But 208, like 206 -- maybe

7

I'm not understanding the question.

8

address only violations of the statute.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. FELDMAN:

Both provisions

Yes.

So in order for the FCC to decide

11

that there's an action either before the agency or the

12

court, it has to identify a violation of the statute.

13

Here it's identified 201(b) as being the provision that's

14

violated.

15

that -- I mean, Mr. Fisher says, well, you can't look at

16

201(b) and decide who is supposed to pay and how much

17

they're supposed to pay.

18

from the very beginning of the Interstate Commerce Act,

19

that you can't look at the words "just and reasonable"

20

and decide whether a rate was just and reasonable or the

21

practices that a carrier is using are just and

22

reasonable.

23

It's absolutely standard for a hundred years

That is absolutely standard

In fact, the whole -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

24

sure I understand you.

Your position on the two

25

different questions that the Chief asked you is, they get

deference on question one.

2

two, it follows from the plain text of the statute.

3

MR. FELDMAN:

And with respect to question

That's correct, that's correct.

I

4

would add also, with respect to the Commission's

5

determination about what is just and reasonable, it was

6

not just a question of saying that a violation of the

7

regulations is just and reasonable.

8

charged here with the responsibility for adopting a

9

compensation scheme that would provide for fair

The Commission was

10

compensation for each pay phone operator for each and

11

every call.

12

of different attempts working out what is a fair

13

compensation.

14

And it spent a number of years and a number

I would submit that all of that reasoning about

15

what is a fair compensation scheme is also reasoning why

16

it's unjust and unreasonable for a carrier not to pay the

17

compensation.

18

dixit, it's a question of years of rulemaking and working

19

out what the scheme should be, so it's fair.

20

It's not just simply a question of an ipse

Once it did that, it didn't require a lot of

21

explanation for why a failure to pay fair compensation

22

that had been worked out over this period of time, a

23

failure to pay that was unjust and unreasonable.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you making the point that

Chief Judge Ginsburg made in the D.C. Circuit that it is
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

necessarily unjust and unreasonable to refuse to pay a

2

charge that is fair and reasonable?

3

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

I'm really expanding on that

4

point, that it didn't -- the FCC has always gotten

5

deference for what -- determining what is unjust and

6

unreasonable under the Act.

And it didn't require a

7

great deal of explanation.

The FCC's explanation here

8

was more than adequate in light of its years of

9

explanation about why this -- this scheme with these

10

rates and these carriers and the primary economic

11

beneficiary being the one who pays.

12

reasons why this was fair compensation.

13

All of that were

Once it decided all of that, it didn't take much

14

to say that a failure to pay fair compensation is unjust

15

and unreasonable.

16

didn't require a huge additional amount of explanation.

That was adequately explained and

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What -- sorry, go ahead.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you would have a

19

different position here if 276 said something like, we

20

think there ought to be more pay phones; in order to

21

promote investment in pay phones, we're going to have

22

this scheme.

23

whether it's fair or not, it's a subsidy.

24

that could be something that's not covered by the "just

25

and reasonable" provision?

In other words, it has nothing to do with

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Then you'd say

Official

1

MR. FELDMAN:

I think in that case also, I would

2

probably be here arguing that maybe if the FCC had

3

determined that it's necessary, for whatever regulations

4

they came up with under that scheme, in order for the Act

5

to function correctly, that they have to be complied

6

with.

7

and unreasonable.

8
9

I think I would also argue that that was unjust

But this case, if the question is, did the
FCC adequately explain what it did here, I think that all

10

of the years of explanation of why something is fair are

11

also reasons why it was unjust and unreasonable not to

12

pay the compensation.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there regulations, FCC

14

regulations, the violation of which would not be unfair

15

and unreasonable?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

I think there probably are.

Mr.

I mean, there's probably

numerous ones that wouldn't be.

question about most FCC action, or at least a lot of FCC

20

action, regulations, adjudications, and so on, most of

21

them have to do with carriers' obligations, and most of

22

them are things that have to do with what's unjust and

unreasonable under the Act.

think Congress intends regulations to be sucked into the

Sandoval really didn't say a heck of a lot.

I mean, your interpretation means

I don't think that that's correct.

It means that in the context of a statute that gives the

unreasonable action, which was not the case in

Sandoval -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah, but you could say any

violation of a regulation is unjust.
MR. FELDMAN:

No.

I think it is possible that the

22

FCC could determine that any violation of a regulation is

23

unjust, and the FCC is entitled to deference for its

24

determinations about what is unjust and unreasonable,

standards.

has always been the case that the agency entrusted with

determining that and getting the communications system

But, in fact, when you look at questions of

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

19

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

Let me begin, Mr. Chief

20

Justice, with your question about whether the FCC can

21

opine on remedies.

22

the FCC was telling everybody it was deciding in these

23

order proceedings.

24

and comment, on whether PSPs have a remedy for violations

25

of the pay phone regulations.

All you need to do is look to what

It was deciding, and asked for notice

That is cited everywhere

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in the briefs.

2

or considered whether failure to pay under the

3

regulations is a violation of 201(b).

4

It never asked for notice and comments,

So the question this Court needs to ask itself is

5

when the FCC, by its own acknowledgment, until now, is

6

simply opining on the presence of a Federal court remedy,

7

whether it gets deference simply because it hangs the

8

hook on a substantive provision of the statute.

9

Now, there are three problems with what the FCC

10

has done in construing section 201.

11

this is not a covered practice, because I want to make

12

clear our position, it's that the FCC has plenty of

13

authority with respect to carrier-customer relationships,

14

but not with respect to carrier-supplier relationships.

15

And that's what we have here.

16

The first is that

On unjust and unreasonable, I think we need to

17

unpack two separate questions.

18

the FCC chose is reasonable, whether the amount of money

19

that it said needs to be put into pay phone operators'

20

pockets is a fair and reasonable choice.

21

dispute about that.

22

could generate deference.

23

One is whether the rate

We have no

And we think that in and of itself

But the FCC's determination to put the payment

24

obligation on long distance carriers simply can't be

25

shoehorned into the unjust and unreasonable phrase in
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

201(b), because if that's -- the only reason why

2

anything, us failing to pay the money, would be because

3

of the regulations.

4

And you hear it again and again in their argument,

5

the FCC having concluded that long distance companies are

6

the ones that pay, the failure to pay is unjust and

7

unreasonable.

8

regulations, and that's what distinguishes -

9

There's no way to get there without the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's not true.

You can

10

say that this is a way you make a lot of money from your

11

customers that you wouldn't otherwise make, because if

12

there wasn't a pay phone there, they wouldn't be able to

13

use your service.

14

MR. FISHER:

The FCC might have said that, but as

15

I said to Justice Souter, that would be a very different

16

proceeding and a very different scheme than we have here,

17

and a very different dollar figure or cent figure that

18

the FCC might have come up with when it was trying to

19

encapsulate that figure, which we think is zero, but

20

under your reasoning may be something very small.

21
