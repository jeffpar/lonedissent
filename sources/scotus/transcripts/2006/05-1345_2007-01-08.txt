ORAL ARGUMENT OF EVAN TAGER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. TAGER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The barriers to interstate commerce imposed

12

by the flow control ordinances in this case are even

13

more severe than those resulting from the ordinance this

14

Court struck down in Carbone.

15

waste can leave the counties for processing.

16

addition, now that Respondent's landfill is up and

17

running no local waste can leave the counties for

18

disposal either.

19

inapplicable to this outright embargo merely because

20

Respondent's own the facilities to which the haulers are

21

required to bring the waste.

22

reason is that the concerns underlying the Commerce

23

Clause are implicated whether interstate commerce was

24

being obstructed for the benefit of a public enterprise

25

or a private one.

As in Carbone, no local

The issue here is whether Carbone is

The answer is no, and the

The whole point of the Commerce Clause was

2

to promote the national economy and to put an end to

3

parochial barriers to interstate trade.

4

consistently held that embargoes, local processing

5

requirements, and other barriers to interstate commerce

6

violate the Commerce Clause because such laws inevitably

7

prompt resentment, retaliation, and ultimately -

JUSTICE BREYER:

This Court has

I guess in many thousands

of municipalities throughout the United States it's

10

fairly common to have a locally owned electricity

11

distribution company, or an electrically -- or a gas

12

distribution company.

13

common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline,

14

or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our

15

town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from

16

the local community.

for about 110 years.

18

And I thought it was fairly

And I guess that's been going on

And yet I've never seen anybody think or

Clause.

MR. TAGER:

The first point of clarification

No, I'm not interested in

I'm interested in just the outcome.

MR. TAGER:

Yes.

I just

I am not, I am not sure

that it's correct that in all of those municipalities

10

you hypothesize that they are actually pairing their

11

provision of local -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I used to teach the

13

subject and I can't say you're wrong.

But I knew that

14

it was a fairly common thing to have a certification

15

that gave you a -- as a company, it would give them a

16

local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly.

17

that was common and it was called a service area, and in

18

the local town, the service area, I never even heard of

19

a company trying to come in and sell from abroad,

20

because I thought that this certificate gave them an

21

exclusive right to provide the local electricity service

22

or the natural gas service.

23

obvious thing.

24

my memory -- I've never focused directly on it.

25

everybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the

MR. TAGER:

But of course, memory is
Therefore, I raise the

Well, if the utility is -- if

the utility is privately owned JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

I'm not talking

7

about that because I guess that would be trying to

8

attack Carbone.

9

Far be it from me.

But I know at least there are these things

10

called municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity

11

companies; and during the New Deal that was thought to

12

be quite a good thing, and that's years ago.

13

that time when people were attacking New Deal agencies,

14

I've never seen an attack based on this ground.

15
16

MR. TAGER:

Well, I think that the same

logic would apply as in -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

The same logic would apply.

19

In all

MR. TAGER:

Yeah, I think it would.

And it would apply to all of the

20

cases this Court has ever held.

21

involving an embargo or a local processing requirement

22

or a local needs requirement, if you just substitute "in

23

public ownership" you'd have the exact same case -

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

In every single case

Well, the fact is there is

a difference between public ownership and giving an
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exclusive franchise to a public company.

2

ownership means that the people of the State have

3

decided to have their own little nationalized industry,

4

which again people don't like, many.

5

there was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.

6

MR. TAGER:

And the public

But I never knew

Well, I think that the whole

7

point of the Commerce Clause was to stop these kind of

8

12

JUSTICE BREYER:
MR. TAGER:

Nationalized industries?

Well, to stop the idea that

everything can be localized.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you don't

13

even have to get into the theory.

14

of municipalities of course is that they decide, well,

15

we're going to run the waste treatment facility and

16

we're going to tax the people in the municipality to

17

support it and the service is going to be free.

18

that a violation of the Commerce Clause?

19
20

MR. TAGER:

What happens in a lot

Now, is

If they're only providing it for

free and not barring you -

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MR. TAGER:

Yes.

-- from engaging in interstate

23

commerce, in the event, for example, that you found

24

there to be some additional benefit from engaging in an

25

interstate transaction, I think we would have -- the

thing because most people would take the free service.

But as a practical

The cost of it is entirely covered by taxes.

Okay.

Now, the people you're representing, out of

waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever

14

they would charge.

Now, why isn't that a restraint on

Well, it's market participation

And the other response is, to call someone a

23

affirmatively decided the issue.

I think the

distinction didn't matter to the majority.

I think the

Official - Subject to Final Review

barriers to interstate commerce, of putting up embargoes

2

and local processing requirements.

3

almost any one of the Court's cases and just substitute

4

in public ownership.

5

And you could take

Take, for example -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But not -- you know, you

6

have a whole string of commercial products, but you have

7

recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been

8

considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal

9

function.

10

And you also say that the total, the -- what

11

is it -- cradle to grave, if the county took over all of

12

the garbage disposal business, the hauling from the

13

garbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't

14

be any commerce problem, right?

15

something less, there is?

16

MR. TAGER:

But if it does

Well, there were two questions

17

embedded there.

Let me see if I can take them in order.

18

The idea that it is a traditional local function, I

19

don't think can support any kind of meaningful test in

20

this case.

21

standard in Garcia and the Tenth Amendment cases, and

22

prior to that in the intergovernmental tax immunity

23

cases, and the reason it did so is it found that it was

24

unworkable to try to determine what is a traditional

25

government function in any particular case.

The Court has rejected that very - that very

11
Alderson Reporting Company

The Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

found that it was in a total line-drawing morass.

2

so it said we're throwing that out.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

Well, there is still at

4

least the obvious distinction, that one of the main

5

purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent

6

protectionism.

Protectionism is when a state favors its

7

own producers.

And you could see, indeed a big argument

8

in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer;

9

well, we are at least favoring one.

10

But now where the

municipality is running it itself, no one is favored.

11

So I don't think it was an object of the

12

Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own

13

government.

14
15

MR. TAGER:

I don't know whether the framers

considered it but I do know -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. TAGER:

18
19

Well, it's about -

-- protectionism wasn't the only

thing that they were concerned about.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, is there something

20

here that is not protection?

21

perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of

22

protection, only one individual was protected.

23

MR. TAGER:

No.

Because Carbone was still

First of all, what was

24

being protected was this plan.

The town had to fund its

25

transfer station, a transfer station that it was going
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to take possession of less than two years after this

2

Court decided the case.

3

So the protectionism that was going on there

4

was really protection of their investment in their

5

scheme.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it was also

7

protectionism -- I mean, I didn't agree with this at the

8

time, but I mean there, it -- you have to admit that

9

there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person

10

who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to

11

the town for a dollar.

12

person or that company was in it for the money.

13

That, so far as we know, that

And so for the period of the five years

14

prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that

15

particular entity was being protected so it could make

16

money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that

17

company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a

18

dollar.

19

handsomely.

20

Surely that entity was being protected

MR. TAGER:

But it would be equally

21

protected, Your Honor, if the government owned the

22

facility but said you keep all the tipping fees until

23

it's paid off and take a nice profit on top, too.

24

This distinction -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, that's -- that's a

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

third case but that's not the question we have here, is

2

it?

3

MR. TAGER:

Well, the case you have here is

4

are you going to adopt a new formalistic particular

5

distinction between public and private ownership, when

6

in the past this Court has concluded that a lot of these

7

other distinctions were unworkable.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
formalistic as if it's a bad thing.

Well, so, you say
But the, the

10

distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private

11

contractor the day before the municipality bought the

12

facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of

13

his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that

14

is state action just because the next day it was going

15

to be controlled by the public entity.

16

day, that type of action would be subject to First

17

Amendment scrutiny.

18

but in many areas of the law it makes all the

19

difference.

20

And yet the next

It may be a formalistic distinction

MR. TAGER:

Well, I just think you are going

21

to be walking into so many line-drawing problems because

22

if that example is one, are you going to require 100

23

percent public ownership, or a majority interest, 50-50?

24

Once you go down this road, I think it is just opening

25

up a huge can of worms when the focus ought to be what
14

is the impact on interstate commerce?

now that the landfill is up and running is an absolute

It is no different, in effect, it is no less
likely to breed resentment and retaliation than -

8
9

What we have here

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is kind of

formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you

10

agreed that if the municipality did it through tax

11

revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and

12

yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free

13

facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.

14

MR. TAGER:

Well, I'm glad you reminded me

15

of that point.

16

Lynn Creamery this Court said that these kind of things

17

make a difference.

18

and certain ways you can't do things.

20

to strict scrutiny.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here, I take it the reason

2

they want to do this is because they wanted their

3

municipal facility to charge a higher price for the

4

non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to

5

segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable -

6

recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less.

7

And that's why they want to do it, and of

8

course that's not going to work.

If somebody comes in

9

from out of State and charges a lower price for all of

10

the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish,

11

it just won't work.

12

interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the

13

same thing.

14

push out the possibility of poorer people getting

15

electricity.

16

they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage

17

recycling.

18
19
20
21
22

It is rather like electricity,

They want discriminatory rates in order to

This they want to do the same thing but

MR. TAGER:

Several answers to that,

Justice Breyer.
One, the same argument was made in Carbone.
It doesn't matter who owns the facility.
Two, this is an argument about why they

23

might survive strict scrutiny, it's not a -- I know you

24

don't like hearing about that -- but the question here

25

is do we apply strict scrutiny or not.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

And that goes to

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the strength of their interest.

2

question turns on, can it be met in nondiscriminatory

3

ways?

4

decided, the municipalities have been living with no

5

flow control, virtually every one in the country, yet

6

recycling has gone up in the, in that intervening

7

period.

8
9

The answer is "very well."

And then of course the

Since Carbone was

Indeed the best way to accomplish recycling
is to charge volume-based fees to, to the -- between the

10

haulers and the, and the generators.

11

going on here.

12

point.

13

me -- plenty of communities all over the country that

14

are charging what's known as a batch fee where you pay

15

for each -- you pay -- you get a label, like you put on

16

a bag; you can't dispose of the bag without the label,

17

the label costs a certain amount of money.

18

these people have flow -- none of these communities have

19

flow control but there's a direct straightforward way.

20

That's not what is

They're just charging it at the disposal

So there are plenty of communities all -- excuse

None of

They can also impose regulations directly on

21

the generators and directly on the haulers to make sure

22

they're doing these things.

23

for creating a brand-new public-private distinction.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it is hardly a reason

It sounds to me as though,

3
4

MR. TAGER:

on that industry.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you know, you know

6

that there are plenty of, of communities that don't have

don't know is whether Justice Breyer's parade of

to provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it,

talk about in the price context.

But in the earlier

cases they referred, cases like Minnesota versus Barber

being burdens on commerce, but clearly what they meant

was there are certain kinds of regulations, and I think

it's easier to just categorize them, embargoes, local

that -- that avoids the problem.

that if the government wants to do this the government's

If the government tries to

pursue these policies solely by private inducement,

trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those

terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county,

another State, what-not.

10

By taking on the job itself, the government

11

in effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can

12

protect its citizens, induce respect for environmental

policy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation

Federal legislation on these environmental matters

to put a plan together to dispose of solid wastes,

MR. CAHILL:

No, Your Honor, it cannot.

If you say the Congress of

interstate commerce, then of course it can do that.

That has happened.

MR. CAHILL:

That is not our position, Your

We're not saying that RCRA or any of these

was recognize that the states do have the sovereign

power to act, and they expected the states to act in

this way.

15

What the Federal statutes did do, however,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Let's take one of these

16

classic discrimination cases involving milk.

17

what you're telling us is that if Wisconsin adopted a

18

law requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility

owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin, that would

20

be perfectly okay.

MR. CAHILL:

I think

That would not discriminate

against interstate commerce.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right.

really advantage Wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it,

and really disadvantage out of Wisconsin dairy farmers,

and you think that the Commerce Clause doesn't speak to

2

that.

3

MR. CAHILL:

No, I do think the Commerce

4

Clause speaks to it, Your Honor, but I just -- our

5

position is it just doesn't require strict scrutiny.

6

think the Pike test is a very good test to get to the

7

bottom of why Wisconsin would want to do such a thing,

8

and it would also be a good test to show just what the

9

adverse impact on interstate commerce was, and what

10

I

precisely the benefits of, to Wisconsin there might be.

11

I think the Pike test -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So then, the

13

Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we

14

would develop federal law about what's appropriate for

municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate?

We could decide it may be appropriate to run waste

facilities but not to run milk pasteurization.

MR. CAHILL:

I don't

I don't know how you would do

that either, Your Honor, but you would be led into that

21

by accepting the petitioner's argument that public

under the Commerce Clause.

24

earlier, Justice Scalia -

25

To go back to your example,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think public ownership and public services are unique

is these are not unique.

that the marketplace would provide if the government was

21

Commerce Clause simply because there's a private entity

accepted, the definition of discrimination would be

changed from differential treatment of economic

interests to differential treatment of government or

can require everybody in the area to go through the one

MR. CAHILL:

Yes.

I would like to close, I think, because I'm

10

running out of time, with just the admonition or

11

requirement that we are, in providing a public service,

12

still subject to the Constitution and we must deal with

the part private sector fairly.

the private sector fairly and we don't favor anyone in

MS. HALLIGAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

As you suggested, Justice Breyer, the theory

dormant Commerce Clause.

15

That is completely

The Court has said, and it has stressed

repeatedly in its precedent, that discrimination is the

that benefits the former and burdens the latter.

conflating the two.

20

MS. HALLIGAN:

Respectfully, I disagree,

21

Your Honor.

Where you have the government taking over a

22

service entirely, that doesn't constitute discrimination

23

because there is no local private interest that is

24

advantaged, and no burden that is shifted to out of

25

state interest.

That is where the dormant Commerce

disproportionately benefit in state or local interests,

as against out of state interests -- But it always does.

MS. HALLIGAN:

We're not asking

MS. HALLIGAN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, Your Honor I don't see the distinction

as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.
MS. HALLIGAN:

If you were to have

24

government action, for example, someone suggested could

the government sell hamburgers.

I believe Justice Alito

2

disadvantage of out of state interests, even if it only

4

that would be appropriate for treatment under strict

5

scrutiny.

6

But that's not what you have here.
What both the district court and the circuit

these local ordnances in fact is on local residents.

Two answers if I can, Your

18

Honor.

First of all, I think this Court has answered

19

that question with respect to waste management more than

20

a hundred years ago in the California Reduction case.

21

It was clearly held there the provision of waste

22

management services is an essential function that

23

governments appropriately provide.

24

So that's been answered here.

25

to this question about hamburgers and other services
49
Alderson Reporting Company

With respect

that look commercial, I think there are two checks on

2

those kinds of ordinances.

3

very likely that in most circumstances if you were to

4

say that hamburgers will be sold at a government

5

operated facility, that that would disadvantage local

6

interests significantly, and there would be a political

7

process check.

8
9

First of all, I think it is

Secondly the Court has been clear that it is
not bound by formalistic distinctions in the Commerce

10

Clause arena and so it will look for discrimination that

11

is protectionist in nature whether it is, as the Court

12

has said, forthright or ingenious.

present itself, and the facts in the facts in this case

14

no whiff of that protectionism, where you were to

22

to ask the Court to review Reeves versus Stake which is

there -- that's the cement plant case -- there's two

25

significant things about that case which I think are of

But what is significant

Alderson Reporting Company

interest.

2

First, the Court's footnote 1 is an

3

interesting historical footnote about how South Dakota

4

had elected to make a lot of these different industries

5

state-run industries, so the hypotheticals we've been

6

discussing are not completely off the wall.

7

for, in that case coal.

Secondly, the Court made a point there in

12

rejecting the argument, the constitutional argument that

13

the state was not prohibiting competing cement

14

companies.

15

it had, there would have been a Commerce Clause problem.

16

Second, Mr. Cahill's user -- user fee point.

And I think the inference from that is that

17

I just want to remind the Court that in addition to

18

paying for the recycling and everything, they were using

19

the user fee to pay off the bond for their failed energy
