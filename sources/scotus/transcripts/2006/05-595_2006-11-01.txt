ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. CHANOS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

Crawford v. Washington should not apply

11

retroactively to cases on collateral review because it

12

fails to meet the exacting standards for retroactivity

13

established by this Court in Teague versus Lane.

14

addition, respondent is not entitled to relief under

15

AEDPA.

16

should not apply to cases on collateral review unless

17

they fall within one of two narrow exceptions.

18

second exception, at issue here, is for those new

19

watershed rules of criminal procedure without which the

20

likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously

21

diminished, rules that alter our understanding of the

22

bedrock procedural elements essential to a fair

23

proceeding.

criminal procedure.

Gideon?

Is there any other one, or -

13

a rule without which the likelihood of an accurate

14

conviction is seriously diminished and it is not a rule

15

which altered our understanding of the bedrock

16

procedural elements essential to a fair proceeding.

17

Crawford is not watershed because it is not

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I take it from your

18

presentation you think we do have to go through the

19

Teague analysis.

20

We can't just rely on 2254(d)(1)?

MR. CHANOS:

No, Chief Justice Roberts.

I

21

believe that you could go straight to 2254(d)(1) and bar

22

relief under 2254(d)(1).

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well then, what do

24

you do about 2254(e)(1), or I guess (e)(2), which seems

25

to suggest at different rule if a case is made
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

retroactive?
MR. CHANOS:

Well, 2254(e)(2) provides a

3

cause and prejudice opportunity in the event that the

4

state court denies relief on a procedural basis rather

5

than a substantive basis and the petitioner can show

6

cause and prejudice under 2254(e)(2)(A).

7

court could then look at the petitioner's claim because

8

no merits determination had been made by the state court

9

and, finding the cause and prejudice elements under

The Federal

10

2254(e)(2), the Federal court would not be precluded

11

from making a merits determination since the -- and

12

conceivably applying a rule that had been made

13

retroactive active under Teague -- because the state

14

court had not made a substantive merits determination.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, my point was

16

that looking at (d)(1), it says is the decision contrary

17

to established law.

18

it's a new decision it's clearly not contrary to

19

established law.

And I would have thought that if

20

MR. CHANOS:

Correct.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But on the other

22

hand, you look at (e)(2) and it says here's what you do

23

if you're applying a new decision that's that been made

24

retroactive.

25

can't say simply because it's a new decision it won't

So I would have thought that meant you

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

apply.
MR. CHANOS:

Our reading of 2254(d)(1) is

3

that Congress intended to have the federal courts give

4

the state courts deference to the extent that the state

5

courts made a substantive determination.

6

courts made no substantive determination, there's no

7

requirement for deference by the Federal courts, which

8

under 2254(e)(2)(A)(i) the Federal court conceivably

9

find that there was cause and prejudice under

If the state

10

2254(2)(a)(i) under the standards enumerated in those

11

subparagraphs (a) and (b) and could then make a merits

12

determination.

13

There would be nothing that would preclude

14

the Federal court from making a merits determination so

15

long as the state court had not already made a merits

16

determination.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, suppose the state

18

has, which is going straight to AEDPA.

19

that Teague is out entirely, even the first category,

20

that is a decision, a substantive decision that would

21

mean that what defendant did was not a crime?

22

MR. CHANOS:

Does that mean

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

It

23

would mean under -- under a plain meaning reading of

24

2254(d)(1), if the state court made a determination on

25

the merits, it would bar subsequent Federal review
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether it was a substantive, a substantive claim or a

2

procedural claim.

3

would be nothing that would prevent the petitioner from

4

going back to the state court and arguing cause and

5

prejudice, and then if the state court were to make a

6

procedural determination on the second petition that

7

was -- that were to deny the petitioner his claim, he

8

could take that to the Federal court.

9

could then look at that because it was only a procedural

claim and the Federal court at that point could look

back at the substantive rule as established law because

on the second claim they have the right, if he's only

14

denied a procedure -- on a procedural basis, there's

15

nothing that would preclude the Federal court on his

And yes, I believe Congress could pass

2254(d)(1) and alter the habeas procedures, as they have

in enacting 2254(d)(1).

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. CHANOS:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Habeas is an equitable -

I'm sorry?
Habeas is equitable relief

and the Court has a lot of discretion in identifying the

MR. CHANOS:

10
11
12

Yes, Justice Scalia.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume that's how we got

to Teague.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask this question

13

as to the basic issue of whether you should be relying

14

on Teague or the statute.

15

statute, how would it apply to a case which was correct

16

under established law at the time that the state court

17

made its ruling, but before the case reached the

18

appellate court, in which there was a change in our

19

interpretation?

20

been decided while the case was on appeal?

21

If you're relying just on the

What if this case -- if Crawford had

MR. CHANOS:

While under the Court's

22

retroactivity jurisprudence Griffith would control,

23

under 2254 it would not.

24
25

22(d)(1) would control.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So it really makes a

difference whether we rely on Teague or whether we rely
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on the statute if we disagree with you?

2
3

MR. CHANOS:

It make difference.

It makes a

difference.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I assume there would

5

be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state

6

court.

7

MR. CHANOS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Yes.
If indeed our law had

changed; don't you think?

10

MR. CHANOS:

Absolutely.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it's inconceivable

12

that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by

13

the state court that rendered the decision.

14

MR. CHANOS:

I believe that the petitioner

15

would be able to make a subsequent habeas petition at

16

the state court level and if they were somehow denied

17

relief on a procedural basis, there would be nothing

18

that would preclude the Federal court from granting them

19

relief thereafter.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's a odd position to

21

take, to

proliferate proceedings that way.

22

thought your argument, AEDPA argument, was:

23

the Federal court is out of it, but the state court is

24

most likely, recognizing that this Court has said what

25

this man did wasn't a crime, to grant him relief.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, I
Too bad,

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if you're making this two-step and saying, but somehow

2

we can change the substantive proceeding into a

3

procedural proceeding, that seems to me odd, to

4

proliferate proceedings that way.

5

MR. CHANOS:

Justice Ginsburg, what we're

6

saying is that Congress in enacting 2254(d)(1) was

7

stating that the Federal courts should give deference to

8

the state court decision so long as it is a merits

9

decision and so long as it complies with existing

10
11

clearly established law and is not unreasonable.
And if that occurs, then Congress under

12

2254(d)(1) was saying give state courts deference under

13

those circumstances.

14
15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

"clearly"; "then clearly established law."

16

MR. CHANOS:

That's exactly.
That is, at the time of the

state court decision. *END STENO
MR. CHANOS:

Exactly, absolutely, at the

20

time of the state court decision.

In fact, if you look

21

at the language of 2254(d)(1) it says "resulted in a

22

decision that was contrary to or an unreasonable

23

application of clearly established Federal law.

Whatever the law was up to the time that the decision,

It didn't say that that

if you describe the right as the right to

Now with respect to the reliability prong of

21

the Teague analysis, there are three reasons that the

22

Roberts rule did not so seriously diminish the

23

likelihood of accurate convictions as to call for

retroactive application of Crawford.

25

The first is that Roberts had a built-in

Roberts unless a determination was made that there were

seriously diminish the likelihood of accurate

promote accuracy.

debatable whether -- how good cross-examination is in

determining the truthfulness of a witness's testimony.

21

Now, our Constitution decides the issue one way, but any

infringement of cross-examination could be susceptible

to the same argument that you are making.

was reliability.

screen on reliability is an additional factor that

distinguishes my example from what you said.

The fact that there was a Roberts

No, I think Crawford that is

reversing the rule of Teague.

there is not -- that the purposes of habeas corpus are

largely exhausted once somebody has received a trial in

22

But if you made retroactive

What Teague says that is

Because of the importance of finality to the

23

system -- and there are only going to be two very -

24

there's only a very narrow window for watershed rules,

25

of rules that, the accuracy of proceedings beforehand

are so seriously diminished that there is an

2

unacceptably large risk that systematically, innocent

3

people were being convicted, and that this is a rule

4

that approaches Gideon in its fundamental and sweeping

5

importance.

6

the Court is going to go back on finality.

7

Those are the only circumstances in which

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How many times have we

8

dealt with a quote, "new rule," with the argument made

9

that it was watershed and therefore should be

10
11

retroactive?

This is not the first time.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, I think that there have

12

been -- I don't know the exact number, but maybe 11 or

13

12, about half of which are ones, are proposed new rules

14

and half of which are ones where the rule was already

15

established previously and the question was whether it

16

was going to be made retroactive.

18

the Court had already established before each one of

them there was a right not to be -- the death penalty to

new rule that built on that basic rule in an important

way; but in each case, the Court said it was not the

23

kind of rule that was going to be applied retroactively.

24

25

And I cited in the

And in each case there was a

The third reason I wanted to give about why
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there was not a serious diminishment in accuracy that is

2

in at least one respect, the Roberts rule actually

3

promotes more accuracy than the Crawford rule, and

4

that's with respect to non-testimonial hearsay.

5

case of non-testimonial hearsay, under Roberts, that

6

could come in only if determination had been made there

7

were particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.

8

Whereas under the Crawford rule, that kind of

9

non-testimonial hearsay comes in without any reliability

10

In the

check under the Constitution at all.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But that's not this case.
Well there was actually in

13

this case the mother's testimony about what the daughter

14

said to her.

15
16
17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm talking about the

daughter's testimony.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

Yes.

The daughter's

18

testimony about what she said to the mother illustrates

19

the difference, because that came in through the mother.

20

It only came in because there was a particularized

21

guarantees of trustworthiness to that statement; whereas

22

under Crawford in future trials, statements to the

23

mother -- which are not testimonial -- they will come in

24

through the mother without any screen for reliability

25

under the Constitution at all.

So in that respect, the

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defendant here got more by virtue of the Roberts rule

2

than by -- than he would have had by virtue of the

3

Crawford rule.

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that the case in Federal

courts, too?

6

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, it is a matter of

7

interpreting -- what protection is left is only going to

8

be by virtue of the residual hearsay rule.

9

will have to be some determination made about whether

10

So there

there are sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, it is conceivable

12

that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to

13

require precisely that anyway.

14

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But Justice Scalia -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In which case you shouldn't

16

be making this argument because it applies only to state

17

courts.

18

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No.

I think it applies

19

equally to Federal courts because it is free to the

20

Federal court system to devise a rule that would allow a

21

looser standard of entry than the Roberts standards, and

22

if it did, that would be constitutional.

23

interest in that kind of argument in the Federal system.

24

I wanted to move on to the bedrock aspect of

25

the inquiry, which is a separate second inquiry that had
23
Alderson Reporting Company

So there is an

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

threshold that has to be crossed if you are going to

2

find something to be watershed, and the only rule that

3

the Court has found to be bedrock is Gideon.

4

rule, Carawford does not approach Gideon in its

5

fundamental and sweeping importance, and there are a

6

couple of reasons for that.

7

And this

First, the right to counsel pervasively

8

affected all aspects of the criminal trial whereas this

9

focuses on one limited -- the admissibility of one

10

limited category of evidence, testimonial hearsay, and

11

adopts a somewhat new rule for that than had existed

12

before.

13

The second thing is that under, the right to

14

counsel is deemed so essential to a fair trial that

15

depriving someone of that right can never be discounted

16

as harmless error, whereas Crawford errors can be

17

harmless.

18

they are found to be harmless.

19

violation of the Crawford rule always and necessarily

20

results in an unfair trial, whereas you can say that

21

about the right to counsel.

22

There are a significant number of cases where
So you cannot say that a

23

first time a right to free counsel in all felony

was a right to cross-examine.

change in an existing right that previously existed to

Thank you very much, Mr. Chief

Members of the Court:
This man was sentenced to life in prison

the only constitutionally reliable test that is now

24

acceptable in this Court.

3

would not have come in.

4

There is no question that if

The government has argued that the

5

reliability screen, so-called, that came from Roberts

6

was sufficient, and it was only an incremental change

7

when the Crawford decision was decided.

8

matter is that this Court found that the reliability

9

screen that the government has discussed was

The fact of the

fundamentally flawed.
And in this case, comparing the right to

12

counsel to the right to cross-examination is easy.

13

is easy because it would not have mattered how many

14

lawyers Mr. Bockting had.

15

he had the finest lawyers in the country.

16

have mattered if he was Duke Power Company and had every

17

lawyer at the highest hourly rate representing him.

18

he was unable to cross-examine his accuser, just as in

19

Crawford -- in Crawford, there was even an audiotape of

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that the new rule

3

produced greater accuracy.

We said that it was the view

4

of the framers of the Constitution that

5

cross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was

6

necessary for greater accuracy.

7

Now in our evaluation of what constitutes a

8

landmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of

9

things?

I mean, you know, maybe -- I'm not sure that if

10

you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of

11

reliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether

12

it wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but

13

that wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is

14

what the Constitution required and what the framers

15

thought were necessary.

16
17

Am I bound, for purposes of the rule we're
arguing about here, to what the framers think?

18

MS. FORSMAN:

No, Your Honor, you are not

19

bound to what the framers think.

However, I think that

you went far beyond simply saying that this was like

The opinion goes

27
Alderson Reporting Company

2

framers' view.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that discussion of

4

the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been

5

produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of

6

justifying the overruling of a case that -- you know -

7

that was not that old.

we maybe expected it would.

MS. FORSMAN:

And I don't think that our

12

burden would to be show that it always produces

13

unreliable results.

14

taken the position that the only constitutional

15

reliability is the right to cross-examination.

16

throughout your retroactivity jurisprudence, you have

17

been able to distinguish easily between issues such as

18

the exclusionary rule, the right to a cross-section of

19

the community on a jury, and the right to

20

cross-examination.

21

decisions that made Bruton, for instance, retroactive,

22

because the right to cross-examination went so directly

23

to the integrity of the fact-finding process.

24
25

I think that this Court has clearly

However,

I would point out to you, the

I think that one of the major difficulties
in the argument being taken by the State 28
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

just structural.

4

can you?

5

That's in an instruction,

The judge is corrupt.

It is

You can't say that about Crawford, or

MS. FORSMAN:

I don't mean to say, Your

6

Honor, that it is structural.

7

whether something is structural error or harmless error

8

has to do with whether or not it is measurable, not

9

whether it's bedrock, not whether it's watershed, not

10

I think the issue of

whether it leads to better accuracy.

11

We know that, because in Teague, although

12

Gideon was the only case explicitly referenced, there

13

was also three other examples mentioned in Teague.

14

There was a trial tainted by mob violence.

15

16

perjured testimony.

17

introduction of testimony with regard to a coerced

18

confession.

19

There was a

And there was a trial flawed by the

We know that two out of those three examples

20

are actually subject to harmless error analysis.

So

21

this Court has never tied the issue of the elements of

22

Teague or even the elements of the pre-Teague

23

jurisprudence to the issue of whether something is

24

structural or harmless.

25

the more recent decision of Gonzalez-Lopez, of the right

It is the issue, as it was in

2

it quantifiable.

accustomed, appellate courts are accustomed to looking

5

at the introduction of this kind of evidence and

6

determining whether or not it is harmless.

7

They are what the Court

And in this case, courts are

The State has not taken a position before

8

this Court that the Ninth Circuit was erroneous in

9

determining that this evidence was prejudicial, and

10
11

therefore affected the outcome.
So the issue of accuracy as defined by the

12

State and by the government, the problem with that

13

argument and the easiest way to see the problem in that

14

argument is if you look to Gideon.

15

wouldn't argue that the insertion of counsel into a case

16

may not result in what the State is defining as a more

17

accurate result.

18

may well cause the exclusion of evidence.

19

many instances that is exactly what counsel does.

20

Certainly we

So their definition of accuracy if applied

21

to the Gideon case would mean that Gideon would flunk

22

that definition, and wouldn't be the case that has been

so repeatedly referenced by this Court as an example of

24

the kind of case that should be made retroactive.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Ms. Forsman, what about

the cases we're had so far on this second Teague

it is appropriate that this be the first time.

previously referenced, those cases fell -- there are 12

of them, by the way.

There were 12 decisions post

actually create a new rule and apply it retroactively.

But if we look to cases such as the

15

retroactivity application of Batson, for instance, what

16

this Court has found is that the Batson rule, the

18

purpose of that rule was not created for the purpose of

19

protecting against unjust convictions or ensuring the

20

integrity of the fact-finding process.

21

purpose of the Batson rule, this Court found that it

22

wasn't the purpose of the Batson rule, and that

23

therefore, it would not fall under the Teague exception.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the decision

2

that said Ring v. Arizona was not retroactive on

3

collateral?

4

MS. FORSMAN:

Again, in Schriro versus

5

Summerlin, the issue there was an issue with regard to

6

ultimate accuracy of a jury versus a judge.

7

Court found that the evidence was -- the evidence was

8

equivocal with regard to whether or not a judge findings

9

or jury findings were more accurate.

10

Again, this

Now you might say, well, that sounds a

11

little bit like Roberts.

12

it isn't like Roberts, because under Roberts, the

13

cross-examination right, which is something that we held

14

so dear and connected so directly to the right to

15

counsel, having counsel without the right to

16

cross-examination, isn't much of a right.

17

The problem with that is that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The problem with your

18

case -- maybe it's our problem because it was our

19

rule -- is that we're asked to adopt an across-the-board

20

calculus as to the rule.

5

some way out.

6

With a rule-made jurisprudence, we have

It seems to me that was the problem you

I don't see it.

MS. FORSMAN:

I can, Your Honor.

The reason

7

that I can is that the judge does not have the ability

8

to see the cross-examination statement either.

9

start with the premise, when making this reliability

10

determination, we would have to throw out all of the

11

statements in Crawford and all of the previous cases

12

which hold so dear the right to cross-examination and

13

say, but a judge can make a reliability determination

14

without ever hearing the statements cross-examined, can

15

make them in that vacuum without ever testing the

16

reliability of the statements with the -- with

17

cross-examination.

18

So if we

And I don't know how you would be able to

19

square that with the strong statements that are made in

20

Crawford.

21

the cases, for instance, in the case finding that Bruton

22

should be retroactive, because it goes to the integrity

23

of the fact- finding process.

24

cases that you've talked about since Teague, the

25

integrity of the fact-finding process is what is at

based upon an accuser's statements being admitted

3

without ever having been cross-examined?

4

Do you have confidence in a result which is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But Ohio versus

5

Roberts was not overruled because of a judgment that it

6

was not doing a good enough job in assessing reliability

7

of these statements.

8

judgment that the Founders wanted there to be

9

cross-examination.

10

It was overruled because of a

MS. FORSMAN:

That's -- Your Honor, that is

11

the base of the decision.

It harkens back to what the

12

Founders believed.

13

described variously from "amorphous to unpredictable,

14

proof manipulable," to saying that the basis for the

15

right to confrontation and cross-examination comes from

16

a basic mistrust of, even to the levels of a judge in

17

terms of accepting the testimony without the advantage

18

of an actual adversary proceeding.

However, the rule in Roberts was

19

This case, of course, illustrates the dire

20

need for cross-examination because the accuser in this

case testified inconsistently at the preliminary hearing

testimony of the counselor.

3

And because the court -- and the record is

4

very scant on what happened here -- the court, the trial

5

court for instance, under Roberts made only a couple of

6

findings and he said the testimony was consistent -- he

7

didn't look at the fact that it had been inconsistent on

8

at least two other occasions -- and said it was

9

chronological, at least according to what the police

10
11
12
13

officer said.
And so there were only a couple of findings
by the trial court at all with respect to
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-

You had the

14

opportunity to challenge those findings under the

15

Roberts regime in state court?

16

MS. FORSMAN:

We did.

We did, and that -

17

and that issue was not reached by the Ninth Circuit

18

because after we had argued the case in the Ninth

Circuit the Crawford decision was decided; and it was at

20

that point that the Ninth Circuit picked up on the

21

Crawford, and they didn't decide the issue of whether or

not Roberts would have meant that this testimony was

unreliable anyway.

that she remembered talking to the police officer, that

she remembered -- but then, but then in terms of trying

to recall the incident, she was unable to recall the

incident, and she was unable to recall it in any of the

couldn't speak or a child who couldn't describe what had

occurred.

I believe that's correct, Your

22

Honor, because the Ninth Circuit did not reach that

23

issue.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Would you comment,

Ms. Forsman, on your opponent's argument based on
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

2254(d)?
MS. FORSMAN:

Yes.

I think the easiest way

3

to explain our position on that is that what has been

4

articulated here is that a retroactive -- a rule made

5

retroactive by this court would be applicable to

6

Mr. Bockting if he had not raised this issue or had been

7

somehow procedurally defaulted along the way.

8

words, in order to be able to get the advantage that was

9

discussed by both the state and the government of the

In other

10

other sections of the statute which clearly recognize,

11

as to the extent that it's relevant the sponsor of the

12

legislation did, that you still have the power to make

13

rules retroactive, but the only way that Mr. Bockting

14

would be able to get advantage of that rule would be if

15

the state court had never ruled on the merits of his

16

claim or had made some sort of procedural ruling that

17

meant that he was defaulted on the claim.

18

Mr. Bockting, who has raised this question of being able

19

to cross-examine his accuser from day one in the trial,

20

he cannot have that rule applied retroactively to him.

21

If instead he now, he goes back later and the court

22

says, no, this is a successor petition, you can't, you

23

can't get it, you can't come into our courtroom, the

24

door is slammed on you, according to the state now

25

there's no ruling on the merits of his claim, and that's
38
Alderson Reporting Company

So instead of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

why that section of the statute would permit the

2

retroactive rule to apply.

3

2254(d)(1), while it has the language

4

clearly established, and the court asked some questions

5

about that, I think it must be remembered that when that

6

statute is being addressed, it's being addressed in

7

state court -- or in Federal court, on Federal habeas.

8

And so at the time that the petitioner is in Federal

9

court, then the rule has been clearly established.

10

The 2254(d) -

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's not -- the

12

state has to result -- the state -- it's adjudicated on

13

the merits in state court and results in a decision that

14

was contrary to clearly established Federal law.

15

MS. FORSMAN:

Correct.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it seems to me

17

that the question is what was the law, what was the

18

clearly established law at the time of the state

19

decision.

20

MS. FORSMAN:

2254(d)(1), I think the only

21

way that you can read that section compatibly with the

22

four other sections which are quoted in our appendix 2

23

of our brief, the only way that you can do that is to

24

recognize, although this Court will recall that it has

25

described AEDPA as not quite a silk purse of legislative
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

drafting, but the only way to make those sections

2

compatible is to say, listen, what was going on when

3

2254(d)(1) was written was we were talking not about the

4

timing of the new rule, what we were talking about is

5

who is it decided by, because before AEDPA was adopted

6

it wasn't apparent that it must be a decision by you, by

7

this Court, that established by the rule.

8

first part.

9

So that's the

And the second part is that it's not dicta.

10

It is an actual holding of this Court that is to be

11

looked to to determine whether or not the state court

12

was wrong.

13

listen, there has to be some meaning to retroactivity,

14

and what does retroactivity mean?

15

like a nunc pro tunc order, that when you've determined

16

that a new rule is retroactively applicable -- and

17

certainly between AEDPA and the Teague exceptions, which

18

you did say in Horn versus Banks, by the way, should be

19

analyzed differently -- although it has not been tossed

20

up to you directly as it has in this case, the meaning

21

of the 2254(d)(1), you have repeatedly advised that

22

Teague is still alive and well and that when you look to

23

the application of whether a rule should be applied

24

retroactively you look to the Teague exceptions, so we

25

also look -

And so the only way to read that is to say,

Retroactivity means

40

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there any language in

2254(d) that could incorporate the Teague exceptions?

3

MS. FORSMAN:

There is not language in

4

2254(d)(1).

5

that Congress was cognizant of Teague is that there is

6

language throughout AEDPA, particularly in the sections

7

that we've quoted to you, that are lifted directly from

8

Teague.

9

The language -- the reason that we know

JUSTICE ALITO:

What would we say if we were

10

to say that 2254(d)(1) accommodates the Teague

11

exceptions, that Congress meant to put them in but just

12

forgot to do it?

13

How would we account for the language?

MS. FORSMAN:

I think that what you would

14

say is that

15

Congress would not have deprived you of the power to

16

make a rule retroactively applicable and would have not

17

then created the ludicrous situation which the state

18

suggests would occur here, which is instead of the

19

motivation in Congress in having someone like

20

Mr. Bockting raise the issue from the very beginning in

21

one unitary proceeding, as opposed to going back, which

22

is what they've suggested he must do in order to get the

23

advantage of a retroactive rule, is that Congress was

24

cognizant of that and in order to make all of the

25

statute -- all of the provisions of the statute have
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

meaning and not render certain provisions, including the

2

sections that we quoted, superfluous, that you must

3

interpret that to mean that the -- that the -- that

4

2254(d)(1) is not a timing statute.

5

look to.

6

rest of it just doesn't make any sense.

7

It's what law do we

That must be what they meant.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Otherwise, the

Isn't that making the tail

8

wag the dog, because there's language in the provisions

9

on successive petitions that refers to Teague, that you

10

would read the Teague exceptions into 2254(d)(1) when

11

there's nothing in the language there that can be

12

interpreted to refer to them?

13

MS. FORSMAN:

No.

I don't believe that's

14

the tail wagging the dog, because I don't think that

15

that was the intent of 2254(d)(1).

16

intent -- again, I think the intent of 2254(d)(1) was in

17

order to define what kinds of decisions the state court

18

decisions should be measured against.

19

some kind of meaning to retroactivity, and retroactivity

20

means that you are making this decision now and you're

21

making it retroactive to the time.

22

be many things, as we know not only from your decisions,

23

but as we know from the very small core of decisions

24

that Teague left open.

25

we must worry whether or not an innocent man has been

I think the

There must be

It is not going to

And it is those decisions where

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

convicted.

2

those -- an unjust, an unwarranted, a wrongful

3

conviction.

4

reliability, that go to the integrity of the

5

fact-finding process, that you are going to let through

6

that veil.

7

It is those rules that protect against

It is only those rules that go to

So if it is only that small core of rules

8

that you reserved in Teague, only that small core of

9

rules, and we know it won't be many at this point, then

10

if you read that compatibly with AEDPA, it is not and,

11

as we know, it is not going to open the floodgates.

12

There is a very defined period of time in which people

13

can bring actions for relief.

14

decision, there is only one year, not from the time that

15

you make -- if you were to make, for instance, this

16

decision retroactive, not from today, but it is one year

17

from Crawford that petitioners have the opportunity to

18

be able to come into court within that statute of

19

limitations with regard to the date on which a new rule

20

is adopted.

21

Under your Dodd decision

It is from that date forward.

So there is a

22

defined population.

In appendix 1 of our brief, you

23

will see all of the decisions that we could find that

24

have actually applied Crawford and there were 49 of

25

them.

And what you'll find is that of the decisions 43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and the state and the government have not disputed

2

this -- of the 49 decisions which we were able to find

3

at the time of the writing of that brief, only five

4

actually resulted in relief.

5

would result in relief here because there is no

6

contention before you that the Ninth Circuit's

7

determination of harmfulness -- there is no

8

determination before you; they haven't challenged that

9

to you.

10

There's no question it

So it would result in relief for

11

Mr. Bockting.

12

not testimonial or there was a previous opportunity to

13

cross-examine, of the 49 decisions only 5 were found to

14

have to result in relief.

15

But because it's harmless error or it's

And that is as it should be.

The state

16

argues that watersheddedness, if that's a word, is that

17

watersheddedness must mean that it affects many, many

18

decisions.

19

Teague can't mean that my burden is to show you that

20

many decisions will be overturned.

21

opposite of what Teague was decided for.

22

Now, that can't mean what Teague means.

That's the exact

Watersheddedness has to do with the

23

alteration of our understanding.

It is difficult for me

24

to understand how the change of course as described by

25

then Chief Justice Rehnquist, that the change of course

that Crawford represented in the way that we look at the

right to confrontation cannot be, cannot be seen as

3

precisely the alteration in the understanding of this

bedrock principle again directly from the language of

Crawford.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE J. CHANOS
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. CHANOS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I only have a few points.
First of all, counsel's argument with regard
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the interpretation of 2254(d)(1) clearly established

2

language is inconsistent with the statement made -

3

statements made by this Court in Lockyer and in Williams

4

v. Taylor.

5

2254(d)(1)'s clearly established phase referred to the

6

holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's

7

decisions as of the time of the relevant state court

8

decision, citing Williams v. Taylor.

9

clearly established federal law under 2254(d)(1) is the

In Lockyer, the Court stated Section

In other words,

10

governing legal principle or principles set forth by the

11

Supreme Court at the time the state court renders its

12

decision.

13

With regard to counsel's point about

14

this case in particular, Bockting, I agree that there

15

are broader issues beyond this particular fact

16

situation.

17

comfortable that when this Court sent this case back

18

down to the Nevada Supreme Court and told the Nevada

19

Supreme Court to follow Ohio -- Idaho versus Wright, the

20

factors in Idaho versus Wright to determine

21

trustworthiness, talk about spontaneity and consistent

22

reputation -- repetition, mental state of declarant, use

23

of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and

24

lack of motive to fabricate.

25

of trustworthiness must be so trustworthy that

However, I want the Court to feel

Particularized guarantees

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.

2

Following that admonishment from this Court,

3

the Nevada Supreme Court found those statements to be

4

reliable and to satisfy the standards of Ohio -- Idaho

5

versus Wright.

6

Finally, I would just point out that

7

although Caldwell is indeed an important rule, and may,

8

in fact, be a fundamental rule, so was Batson in Teague,

9

as was Caldwell in Sawyer, as was Ring in Summerlin, as

10

was Duncan in DiStefano as was Mills in Banks.

11

Court failed to apply retroactive status to any of those

12

important fundamental rules saying none of them rose to

13

the level of Gideon versus Wainwright.

14

be true with your decision here with respect to

15

Crawford.

16

Yet this

The same should
