ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. OWEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When this Court granted review in mid

12

October in these consolidated cases, the cases

13

exemplified the Fifth Circuit's settled approach to

14

reviewing claims of error under this Court's 1989

15

decision in Penry v. Lynaugh.

16

below failed to take seriously the requirement that

17

capital jurors have a meaningful basis for giving effect

18

to the relevant mitigating qualities of a defendant's

19

evidence, and in both cases the court below found as a

20

factual matter, both against common sense and this

21

Court's holdings, that reasonable jurors would regard

22

evidence that a defendant had experienced significant

23

mistreatment or abuse as a child or had mental

24

impairments as an adult as reasons to find him less

25

dangerous rather than more dangerous.

In both cases the court

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But those opinions, however incorrect, no

2

longer represent the Fifth Circuit's view of Penry.

3

mid December the Fifth Circuit decided in its en banc

4

decision in Nelson vs. Quarterman to take a sharp turn

5

away from its prior treatment of Penry claims and to

6

follow instead this Court's guidance in Tennard and

7

Smith.

8

that we imagine underlay this Court's decision to grant

9

review in this case has been so profoundly changed by an

10

intervening decision of the court below, we respectfully

11

suggested by motion that the Court return these cases,

12

vacate the judgments, return them to the Fifth Circuit

13

for further consideration in light of the new opinion in

14

Nelson.

15

In

Under such circumstances, where the assumption

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why, when we are told

16

that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in

17

this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so

18

all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting

19

the Nelson case for this one?

20

MR. OWEN:

I don't believe, Your Honor,

21

that, that all that would be accomplished by that would

22

be certainly not just delay.

23

chooses to wait for the State's cert petition in Nelson,

24

the Court could certainly put our cases aside and hold

25

them awaiting Nelson -- Nelson's cert petition should be

I think that if the Court

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

filed by mid March -- and then could make its judgment

2

about whether to grant cert in Nelson or not.

3

If it granted cert in Nelson it could decide

4

the three cases together; if it found Nelson raised no

5

questions that were worthy of review, it could either

6

proceed to decide these cases or send them back to the

7

Fifth Circuit.

8

though, Your Honor, is based on a, a misreading of

9

Nelson.

I think that the State's decision,

I think that the State has suggested to the

10

Court that Nelson is in the State's phrase a narrow

11

fact-based decision and I think that's not, I think

12

that's not a fair characterization of the Nelson -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, why can't we just

14

read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not

15

it's correct?

16

MR. OWEN:

I think the main reason, Your

17

Honor, is that these cases aren't Nelson, and that

18

Nelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the

19

Court's consideration, that would be the better vehicle,

20

rather than trying to use in effect these cases to

21

decide issues that are presented by a different set of

22

facts.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If these cases aren't

24

Nelson that's a reason why we should decide these cases;

25

it seems to me.

1

MR. OWEN:

Well, Your Honor, I am, I am

2

confident that if the Court chooses to proceed on the

3

merits of this case that we will prevail on the merits,

4

until it finds -

5
6

JUSTICE STEVENS:
convince us of that?

7
8

Well, why don't you try to

MR. OWEN:

Then let me turn, let me turn to

our, our merits, Your Honor.

9

The issue before the Court in this case as

10

we said is whether the jury instructions gave the jurors

11

a meaningful basis for considering the relevant

12

mitigating qualities of these two Defendants' mitigating

13

evidence.

14

that he was hospitalized for treatment for a major

15

episode of depression about three months before the

16

murder, and the fact that the evidence indicated he had

17

suffered serious abuse, serious physical and emotional

18

abuse from his father as a teenager.

19

the evidence indicated that as a result of neglect and

20

deprivation that he suffered as a child, he had himself

21

emotional problems, fragmented personality, chronic

22

depression, enormous need for nurturance, a lot of

23

emotional turmoil and problems that continued into

24

adulthood.

25

In Mr. Brewer's case that included the fact

In Mr. Cole's case

And in addition to that, the expert who
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

testified at Mr. Cole's trial indicated that he had been

2

given a set of generally accepted neuropsychological

3

tests and that on those tests he had scored below normal

4

and on some of them very far below normal, under the

5

fifth percentile.

6

suffers from some sort of central nervous dysfunction

7

which limits his impulse control.

8

suggest that under this Court's decision in Penry, those

9

are all the kinds of facts about these two Defendants

And as a result that he probably

We respectfully

10

that could reasonably support a juror in concluding that

11

a life sentence rather than the death penalty was an

12

appropriate sentence.

13

But because the jurors were never asked

14

whether the mitigating evidence reduced the Defendant's

15

culpability in such a way as to call for a life

16

sentence, the resulting death sentences are unreliable.

17

The jurors are asked only two questions as the Court

18

well knows.

19

Texas statute jurors were only asked two questions:

20

the crime committed deliberately and is the Defendant

21

likely to pose a continuing threat to society?

22

those instructions alone as has been mentioned earlier

23

this morning, don't mention mitigating evidence; the

24

verdict form doesn't mention mitigating evidence; and so

25

this Court has held repeatedly that whether that two

But just to review, under the pre-1991

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Was

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

question format satisfies the Eighth Amendment's

2

individualized sentencing requirement is a matter of the

3

evidence that's presented in a particular case, how it's

4

argued to the jury, and what are the jurors told about

5

the meaning of their instruction.

6

And we believe that in this case, throughout

7

the trial -- in both of these cases, excuse me -

8

throughout the trials the jurors were emphatically told

9

that they were not entitled in deciding the future

10

dangers test question to engage in any sort of broad

11

inquiry into these Defendants' moral culpability.

12

Instead, the prosecutors in both cases made very clear

13

to the jurors during jury selection that in answering

14

the future dangerousness question you must put to one

15

side your opinion about whether the Defendant's

16

background, for example, calls for a particular sentence

17

and answer the question solely on, as the prosecutor put

18

it, the basis of the facts.

19

evidence in this case very strongly would have supported

20

the inference that these, both of these Defendants were

21

likely to be dangerous -

22
23

And we feel that the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How would you

compare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?

24

MR. OWEN:

I think, Your Honor -

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
9
Alderson Reporting Company

These are closer

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases than Penry, I think.

2

wouldn't you?

3

MR. OWEN:

You'd have to concede that,

I think they are different cases,

4

Your Honor, I'm not willing to concede that they are

5

closer cases.

6

only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence in

7

these cases is that the Defendants are likely to be

8

dangerous in the future.

9

conclusion that would have been compelled by the

10

I think that in, in the juror's mind, the

evidence in Penry.

11

That is exactly the same

I think that -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How does that, if the

12

evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's

13

still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of

14

some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.

15
16

MR. OWEN:

Absolutely.

Absolutely, Your

Honor,.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you -- if your case is

18

less strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other

19

way.

20

mitigating factors.

21

But it doesn't mean that those factors are not

MR. OWEN:

I couldn't agree more, Your

22

Honor.

I think it's very clearly settled by Tennard and

23

other cases going back to 1976 that facts like a

24

deprived or abused background or mental impairment are

25

certainly mitigating.

And with further response to your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Tennard, Tennard was

decided after the State decision here, wasn't it?

4

MR. OWEN:

This Court's decision in Tennard

5

postdates the State court decisions in both of these

6

cases.

7

Yes, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

AEDPA case, isn't it?

9

MR. OWEN:

10

And where is -- this is an

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we're, we're asking

11

whether this State court made an unreasonable decision

12

at the time, and at the time regardless of what the

13

Fifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson,

14

and -- and there is another earlier case, we said that

15

you didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long

16

as there was some manner in which mitigating effect

17

could be given that was enough.

18

MR. OWEN:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

utterly irrelevant even if it is right.

21

MR. OWEN:

The Court has been consistent So I think Tennard is

I, I -- I don't agree.

And

22

here's why, Your Honor.

Tennard was itself both a

23

habeas case and a case governed by the antiterrorism

24

act, like these two cases.

25

was called on to decide not squarely the question of

And so in Tennard the Court

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whether the State court decision in that case had been

2

objectively unreasonable, but whether a reasonable

3

jurist could have found it to be objectively

4

unreasonable such that a certificate of appealability

5

was warranted.

6

Mr. Tennard's case was decided by the State

7

court in 1997, so I think it is immanent in this Court's

8

ruling in Tennard that at least as of 1997, it was

9

apparent that a, a low IQ score alone implicated the

10

concerns of Penry.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did Tennard purport to

12

overrule Smith, even when it came down?

13

simply quoted language of the Justice O'Connor's

14

concurrence in an earlier case.

15

purport to overrule Smith?

It simply, it

It certainly didn't

16

MR. OWEN:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm sorry, Johnson, not

MR. OWEN:

And I, and I --

18

I, I see where Your Honor is -

Smith.

19

Yes.

no, it

20

didn't purport to overrule Johnson.

And the reason why

21

is this:

22

cases together on Penry is this concept of meaningful

23

consideration.

24

language from Johnson:

25

some effect.

I think the concept that ties this Court's

Because Your Honor focused on one bit of
the jury has to be able to give

Elsewhere in the Johnson opinion the Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

said there has to be a meaningful basis for giving

2

effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the

3

evidence.

4

be read out of the context of the other.

5

And I think neither of those two phrases can

In other words, it can't just be some

6

imaginable, conceivable, strained effect.

It has to be

7

some effect which speaks sensibly to the way that a

8

juror would -- would understand the evidence to relate

9

to future dangerousness.

In the Johnson case, the

10

defendant's evidence was his chronological youth, and I

11

believe that it was, it is sensible for the Court to

12

find that a reasonable juror could conclude that, that

13

its relevance to culpability and its relevance to future

14

dangerousness are essentially coextensive.

15

not like that.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

This case is

In Brewer -

Well, in Johnson wasn't

there also -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Go ahead.

Wasn't there also mitigating

21

evidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth,

22

which is analogous to what was involved at least -- well

23

in both of these cases?

24
25

MR. OWEN:

Very little such evidence, Your

Honor, in Mr. Johnson's case.

And in that case moreover

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this Court's question presented, the question on which

2

it granted review, was limited to the question of age,

3

so this Court didn't reach or decide in Johnson the

4

question of whether the other facts about Johnson's

5

background that found their way before the jury might

6

have been within the jurors' effective reach.

7

And I do think that the specific evidence in

8

Johnson again was argued as a basis for a finding of

9

nondangerousness, of rehabilitatability.

That's utterly

10

untrue of evidence in Mr. Brewer's case and Mr. Cole's

11

case, where I think it's very clear that the evidence is

12

being offered to provide some kind of explanation for

13

the jurors about what caused these men to commit these

14

terrible crimes, not that -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But in, in Brewer's

16

case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one

17

hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic

18

major depression.

19

to determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in

20

assessing the likelihood that there was going to be

21

further violent behavior.

So it was certainly opened for a jury

22

MR. OWEN:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

different than Penry.

25

MR. OWEN:

I don't think, Your Honor Quite a bit

I don't think that you can
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

separate the diagnosis of depression, that, even that

2

one single episode of hospitalization for depression,

3

from what the jury knew about Mr. Brewer's upbringing,

4

from the fact that they knew he had been hit by his

5

father in the terms of, his mother said, numerous times.

6

He was struck with the butt of a pistol, he was hit with

7

a flashlight, he was hit with a stick of firewood.

9

better kill me, because I'll kill you.

His

He saw his

10

father bloody his mother, and bruise her eyes, throw

11

chairs at her.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And your submission

13

-- your submission is that every juror is, or a

14

reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only

15

conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is

16

more likely to be violent in the future?

17

the conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because

18

of this, that he should -- mercy should be shown to him

19

in light of all of this?

20

can speculate which way the jury is going to go.

21

MR. OWEN:

As opposed to

And I just don't see how you

I think that it's not simply

22

speculation, Your Honor, I think this Court recognized

23

in Tennard as it did in Penry, that when there is

24

evidence of mental impairment before the jury, there is

25

at least the probable inference of dangerousness.

that this is a commonplace understanding in our society.

And the reason that we know that, Your

I think that

this Court's case in -- decision in Tennard, when it's

24

talking about the inference of probable future

25

dangerousness, this Court says:

The jurors might well

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have believed that Mr. Tennard would be dangerous in the

2

future, both as an inference to be drawn from the

3

evidence and because the prosecutor expressly told them

4

that's how they ought to regard the evidence.

5

And in this case we have the prosecutor, in

6

Mr. Brewer's case we have the prosecutor expressly

7

telling the jury, just as the prosecutor did in Mr.

8

Tennard's case, what is mitigating about the guy's

9

background -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the, so the -

11

but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial

12

statement in the Cole case cuts against you.

MR. OWEN:

It simply doesn't cut as far in

favor of us, Your Honor.

that if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some

MR. OWEN:

I think that it's not

16

unconceivable that a juror could have reasoned in that

17

fashion.

18

think that this Court's decisions in Penry and Tennard

19

suggest that a juror's commonsensical response to

20

evidence that a defendant has, presently poses a grave

21

danger as a result of his life experiences and the

22

enduring impacts that they have left upon him, the

23

reasonable response of a juror shown such evidence is to

24

find future dangerousness, and that that is precisely

25

the problem with the pre-1991 Texas sentencing statute.

But I think it's not reasonably possible.

I

If we had a broad mitigating evidence

trying to decide which one controlled this case.

Penry which involved evidence of mental impairment and

3

child abuse, and it had Johnson and Graham which

involved evidence of youth and other background.

5

think that the facts of these cases, given the facts of

6

these two cases, it is objectively unreasonable to say

7

they fit over here with Johnson and Graham rather than

they fit over here with Penry.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
When the State court considered these Penry

20

claims in 1994, 1999 and January 2001, this Court's

21

decisions in Graham and Johnson made it clear that the

22

Eighth Amendment requires only that a jury be only able

23

to consider mitigating evidence in some manner, not in

24

every conceivable manner.

25

mitigating evidence may be viewed as relevant to moral

It may be weaker.

You can argue about

In Graham in particular, the Court was not just

childhood, a difficult childhood in which Graham's

20

mother had been hospitalized with a mental illness, his

21

custody shifted from relative to relative.

exactly the same kind of evidence we have in Cole.

that's why the jury should regard the murder as

2

aberrational.

3

we're dealing with people who are dangerous.

4

That was the Graham picture, whereas here

MR. MARSHALL:

Well, Your Honor, that's not

5

the way counsel argued it to the jury in either case.

6

In both of these cases defense counsel presented his

7

case to the jury during -- through his evidence and his

8

argument, that this was youthful indiscretion or it was

9

an aberration, and it wouldn't happen again, which is

10

exactly what Graham -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What other choice does

12

defense counsel have, given that the jury is going to

13

get a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the

14

future?

What else could counsel argue?

15

MR. MARSHALL:

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

16

that's not the question before the Court.

17

before the Court is whether the Eighth Amendment was

18

violated and whether the jury had a reasonable

19

opportunity, and in -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

The question

Well, maybe sending

21

counsel into those two questions, what violates the

22

Eighth Amendment instead of doing what Texas now does

23

and say jury mitigating evidence is for you to judge.

We're not going to bottle it up inside of two special

questions.

MR. MARSHALL:

Respectfully, Justice

2

Ginsburg, that's not the question before the Court,

3

though.

4

the State courts unreasonably determined that these

5

juries had a fair opportunity to consider that evidence.

6

And I think looking at argument, when we're determining

7

the reasonableness of that decision, looking at

8

counsel's argument is all we have to go on in

9

determining whether the jury had a fair shot.

10

We're trying to determine in this case whether

Now I

think if you look back at the '90s -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But realistically, a

12

defense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have

those two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the

14

jury into those questions.

MR. MARSHALL:

18

so what counsel chose to do is not the question.

looking at what he did, and we've got this record to

work with.

Your Honor, that was a
This is not a Sixth Amendment

MR. MARSHALL:

Alderson Reporting Company

I think what we're

1

opportunity here, regardless of what counsel chose not

2

to do or what the statute forced him to do.

3

when the State courts looked at these claims in 1994 and

4

1999, this evidence was much more like Graham than it

5

was like Penry, and it was reasonable for them to decide

6

that there was no Penry error in these cases because of

7

that fact.

8

that's not the case, then I think we've arrived at the

9

point where Penry has swallowed the rule announced in

The fact is

And I think it's worth mentioning that if

10

Jurek 31 years ago and it -- to which it was only

11

supposed to be an exception.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Jurek was a facial

13

challenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see

14

that there are things that would fit into it.

15

character would fit into it.

16

we're not certainly not ruling on that.

17

saying is it doesn't fall on its face, and then as cases

18

come up the law is filled out.

19

Jurek didn't say across the board, it's enough that

20

there are these two special factors, that everything can

21

be squeezed into them, all mitigating evidence one way

22

or another can be squeezed into them.

23

MR. MARSHALL:

Good

But Jurek said as applied,
All we're

But Jurek doesn't say --

That is correct, Your Honor.

24

Jurek was a facial challenge.

But in Johnson and Graham

25

the Court made it pretty clear, I think, that as long as
25
Alderson Reporting Company

1

the evidence is relevant in some way within those

2

special issues, some mitigating way -

3
4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought in Johnson the

only question presented was age.

5

MR. MARSHALL:

In Johnson, Your Honor?

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

MR. MARSHALL:

Yes.

Youth was the central point

8

of Johnson, but Graham involved youth and a distinctly

9

troubled childhood, much like we have in these cases.

10

And so if that evidence was relevant within future

11

dangerousness and did not amount to Eighth Amendment

12

error, then this evidence has to be just as relevant.

13

And in fact we have another layer of analysis on top of

14

this because we are looking at the State court's

15

decision under AEDPA.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't see how this fits

17

in the Graham package.

The Graham is, this child came

18

from a deprived background but managed to survive it,

19

and he fits right into the category, he's not dangerous.

20

Look at all the bad things that were done to him.

He

Apart from this one

MR. MARSHALL:

That's essentially the

25

picture, Justice Ginsburg, in Brewer.
26
Alderson Reporting Company

That's exactly

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the way counsel presented it to the jury.

But not only

2

did counsel argue that he wasn't going to be dangerous

3

despite his childhood shortcomings, there was a

4

deliberateness definition submitted in the Brewer case,

5

which is what this Court suggested in Penry in 1989

6

might remedy this problem.

7

definition of deliberateness and counsel argued it to

8

the jury, that -- the definition was read to the jury,

9

counsel argued -

And so the court submitted a

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. MARSHALL:

Where is that charge?

It appears at page 90 of the

12

joint appendix, Your Honor, and that's the Brewer joint

13

appendix.

14

and the definition reads as follows:

15

an act characterized by or resulting from careful and

16

thorough consideration characterized by awareness of the

17

consequences, willful, slow, unhurried and steady, as

18

though allowing time for a decision."

19

that definition to the jury during his closing argument.

20

He argued that Brewer's crime reflected poor planning

21

and execution, that he was led into it by other actors,

22

by his girlfriend Christy Nystrom, and that his

23

commitment to a mental hospital and his mental illness,

24

depression in this case, were argued specifically as

25

cause for those faults.

Now counsel read that definition to the jury,
"A manner of doing

Now counsel read

And so counsel related the
27

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence within that deliberateness instruction to the

2

jury, and that provided them with a significant vehicle

3

to give effect to this evidence.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that what the Penry

5

Court was talking about, something like what you just

6

read?

7

MR. MARSHALL:

I think so, Your Honor, and

8

the Penry Court was not specific about what that

9

definition should say, but this is certainly helpful to

10

the jury in this case and in taking account some of this

11

evidence that was before it.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you see, in Johnson

13

the Court was confronted with the special issues and it

14

makes the assumption based on the State's representation

15

there, that the special issues had enough latitude for a

16

jury to fully consider this.

17

cases is that the prosecutors tell the jury, they keep

18

reminding the jury you just must answer special issues

19

one and two as given.

20

even though you felt maybe he had had a rough time as a

21

kid, you still must put that out of the mind, of your

22

mind, and just go by the special issues.

23

concern in these cases.

24
25

What has happened in these

And in the Cole case they say,

MR. MARSHALL:

And that's the

That may be a concern,

Justice Kennedy, but the Cole case provides a particular
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

example of how defense counsel countered that argument.

2

75 percent of his argument, which is between pages 141

3

and 144 of the Cole joint appendix, 75 percent of that

4

argument is that Cole will burn out as he grows older,

5

and that's based on the testimony of his experts.

6

he says that burnout, that likeliness that he will not

7

be dangerous is a reasonable one.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

issues confined him to that.

10

MR. MARSHALL:

And

But that's because the

That's correct, Your Honor,

11

but that's a legitimate argument on the evidence here,

12

and I think that it would be, it's difficult in my mind

13

anyway to determine that the State court in reading

14

Graham and Johnson could unreasonably determine that

15

that wasn't a good vehicle for the jury when he said,

16

you have a reasonable doubt about this man's

17

dangerousness because of the testimony that we presented

18

to you from his experts that said he wouldn't be

19

dangerous in the future.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He's 30 years old, and

21

the testimony is 40, 50.

22

this man is going to be walking in prison corridors and

23

he's going to be a danger for at least 10 years.

24

that's an effective -

25

MR. MARSHALL:

It says, jury, for 10 years

And

Justice Ginsburg, that's
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

easily as effective as the -- as youth was in Graham and

2

Johnson.

3

know how long it takes people to grow out of youth, but

4

certainly 10 years wouldn't be unreasonable under the

5

circumstances in that case.

6

difference between youth and burnout in this context.

7

We are talking about a finite amount of time, we don't

8

know exactly what that amount of time is, but it's

9

certainly reasonable for a jury to give mitigating

10
11

Youth is evidence that -- I mean, we don't

And so I don't see any

effect to it under that question.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Marshall, I heard

12

what you read from this charge, and I don't have the

13

exact words of what the Court was talking about in

14

Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would

15

enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime

16

deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not

17

slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that

18

his background and diminished mental capacity diminished

19

his moral culpability, making the imposition of the

20

death sentence unwarranted.

21

So what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's

22

deliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them

23

even though it was deliberate, because of his abuse,

24

because of his retardation, he is not morally culpable

25

to the same extent as someone who doesn't have those
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

impairments.

2

could be given and that would be okay under the

3

deliberateness.

4

you read.

5

That's the instruction that Penry said

Quite different from the instruction

MR. MARSHALL:

It's different, Your Honor,

6

but I don't think it's that much different, and the

7

reason is that this makes the crime a function of

8

awareness of the consequences of slow unhurried

9

consideration of those consequences.

And then counsel

10

argues to the jury that Brewer is uncapable of engaging

11

in that sort of premeditation because of his mental

12

problems, and so that's what reduces his culpability

13

under the circumstances.

14

argument and the definition, which we were bound to do

15

under Boyde versus California, we're supposed to look at

16

the entire context of the trial here, that that meets

17

that suggestion in Penry for it.

18

the Court suggested.

And I think if you combine the

It's not exactly what

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

about moral culpability in what you read?

21

MR. MARSHALL:

Wasn't there something

No, Your Honor.

22

mentioned in this definition.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not

That's what Penry makes

24

clear, makes the distinction, between these are factors

25

that don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't

Alderson Reporting Company

act deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide

2

that they reduce his moral culpability.

3

what this charge was?

4

MR. MARSHALL:

And that's not

This charge is different and

5

you're correct in that, Justice Ginsburg.

However,

6

future dangerousness also provides that vehicle in this

7

case, just the same as it did in Graham, and so -- and

8

in Johnson.

9

the evidence of a troubled childhood, could find effect

The Court said that this kind of evidence,

10

within future dangerousness in some manner.

And granted

11

we can conceive of other ways it might be relevant to

12

culpability, but the Court explained -- and this was

13

what the State court was working with at the time it

14

considered this claim -- this Court explained that just

15

because we can imagine other ways in which it might be

16

relevant doesn't mean that we have got Eighth Amendment

17

error.

18

of getting to it.

19

different than the evidence that the Court said fit

20

within future dangerousness in Graham.

It's just important that the jury had some way
And I don't see how this is markedly

21

Now, in -- I think another thing that I need

22

to mention about Cole is, is that my colleague noted the

23

expert testimony that Cole lacked impulse control.

24

I think the, the mitigating nature of that testimony in

25

this case becomes especially apparent when you realize
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that, that Cole planned this crime 2 days in advance.

2

He planned to strangle this 66-year-old blind man 2 days

3

before he did it.

4

control problem mitigates his culpability for this crime

5

in any way and I don't think any reasonable juror would

6

ever see that.

7

significance of that evidence in this case is severely

8

diminished as opposed to the testimony that the jury

9

heard in Penry, for example, which is that he'll never

10

learn from his mistakes, he had previously committed a

11

rape, he didn't learn from it; this time he committed a

12

murder and a rape.

13

that evidence was only aggravating within future

14

dangerousness.

15

And so I don't think that an impulse

So I think that the mitigating

And so the mitigating relevance of

How do we, how does

16

that factor in on the issues that are before us, the

17

weakness of the mitigating evidence?

18

19

question in these cases.

In what way are we

We don't have a harmless error

20

MR. MARSHALL:

There is no harmless error

21

question, correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

when we're looking at the Boyde standard, which is -

23

and in Johnson -- a reasonable likelihood that the jury

24

was precluded from giving effect to the evidence, the

25

reasonableness of that likelihood, the reasonableness of
33
Alderson Reporting Company

However, I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that possibility, depends upon the way the juror, the

2

jury, heard the evidence and the relative strength of

3

that evidence.

4

And so evidence of intoxication, for

5

example, while it does mitigate culpability in some

6

manner, would not create the reasonable possibility of

7

Eighth Amendment error in that sense.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your argument is

that the mitigating evidence was not precluded by,

10

reasonable consideration was not precluded by the

instruction; it was precluded by the fact that there

wasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?

That may be true, Your Honor.

Yes.
Reasonable likelihood that

the juror was precluded from considering the relevant

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So if the

6

evidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent

7

you from considering it, then it's precluded.

8

the evidence is very weak it didn't matter.

9

MR. MARSHALL:

But if

Well, I think it's a

reasonable reading of Graham and Johnson, though, Your

Honor, that weak evidence does fit within these special

issues.

therefore there was no reasonable likelihood that they

and you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about

20

he did it deliberately.

21

well, could I consider it because it shows a bad

sure it shows me that, but can I consider it for that

And what's the Texas case

MR. MARSHALL:

Your Honor, it's not a Texas

Court said that evidence of a troubled childhood, of the

taken as an aberration, that the person will not repeat

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

But the answer to

2

Justice Breyer it seems to me has to be that you can

3

only consider it in the, in the context of

4

deliberateness or future dangerousness.

5

MR. MARSHALL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that depends on

7

the nature of the evidence, I take it?

I mean, if the

8

evidence we were talking about was biological

9

predisposition to violence, that's only going to point

10

in one direction, right?

11

isolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is

12

that, well, a juror might look at that and say, well,

13

that's why he did it, and that since it was isolated

14

it's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be

15

regarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.

16
17

MR. MARSHALL:

I mean, if the evidence is

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so when you get

19

into this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we

20

supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that

21

anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to

22

do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going

23

to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to

outgrow it?

based on the particular evidence and the particular

Do we make that determination in every case

arguments that counsel made?
MR. MARSHALL:

I don't think there's any

3

other way to do it, Mr. Chief Justice.

This Court has

4

continually engaged in a case-specific analysis on a

5

case-by-case basis in these types, when granting these

6

types of claims.

7

If the Court has no further questions -

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Unless you take the view

that Penry took, which is you have to let the jury

10

distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct

11

on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that

12

don't tie in at all to dangerousness.

13

MR. MARSHALL:

That's because, Justice

14

Ginsburg, the Penry's evidence was relevant only in an

15

aggravating way to those issues.

16

other than the fact that he would be a future danger,

17

and when the evidence is not so aggravating, when the

18

evidence suggests, suggests that there is a mitigating

19

answer to the future dangerousness question, that the

20

person won't be a future danger because they're going to

21

burn out or because this is an isolated incident, we

22

have a different situation.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. OWEN

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

5

MR. OWEN:

I'd like to make two points about

6

Graham since it's been a subject of some discussion.

7

First is to remind the Court that Graham was a Teague

8

case.

9

prior to Penry -- Mr. Graham's case became final on

Graham was a case about whether the law in 1984,

10

direct appeal -- dictated the result that he was asking

11

for, which I think doesn't mean it has no persuasive

12

impact on these cases, but I certainly think it limits

13

its precedential value outside the scope of the question

14

of youth that Johnson later settled squarely.

15

The second thing I want to say about Graham

16

is this is the State's brief in Graham, 91-7580, and I

17

want to just note that at page 26, squarely.

18

the State's brief in Graham 917580 and I want to note at

19

page 26, footnote 8 the State says the insubstantiality

20

of Graham's evidence of a troubled childhood is readily

21

apparent, which certainly suggests that there is a fair

22

reading of the evidence in Graham of this background

23

evidence as not being substantial, not being evidence

24

about abuse or mistreatment.

25

from one relative to another because of the

This is

The fact that he was moved

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circumstances in his family, in that case was not shown

2

to have any negative impact on him.

3

Mr. Cole's case certainly there is expert testimony that

4

it had a very devastating negative impact on him.

5

Graham really does not even give the Court much guidance

6

on the question of troubled background because there is

7

no indication that Graham actually had a, a background

8

of mistreatment.

9

Whereas I think in

So

By the same token with respect to the

10

State's comment or my brother's comment that the, the

11

record doesn't bear out that Mr. Brewer was struck by

12

his father with a stick of firewood, that is correct.

13

What the record actually says is, if I may quote from

14

the Brewer JA at page 90 -- 95 -- 65, excuse me:

15

tried to hit him with a stick of firewood.

16

outside to grab the firewood I --" -- that's

But the argument is

12

that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the

instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows

14

that he will be violent again.

15

they can take it into account in any way to determine

16

that it's a situation in which they should extend mercy,

17

or that, I guess it was, I get the Cole and the Brewer

18

records confused here, but that this, the cause for the

violence will abate with, with age.

They will not feel that

MR. OWEN:

I think, Your Honor -

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or that in, I guess

22

in Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence

23

was caused by a particular bout of depression, that

24

would not necessarily recur.

25

MR. OWEN:

I, I don't think that's -- that's
46

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

not our argument, first, Your Honor, for this reason.

2

The court's question was, as I understand

3

it, don't we have to show there is no way the jury could

4

have understood this evidence except as aggravating?

5

don't think that's, I don't think that's the test.

I guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or
not it could be considered in some manner.
MR. OWEN:

In some manner that is reasonable

12

and that gives effect to the relevant mitigating

13

qualities of the evidence.

14

think that the, that the fact of Mr. Brewer's -- the

15

fact that the jury knew that he had endured this

16

mistreatment as a teenager could only have been given

17

aggravating effect.

18

reason from the premise that he was mistreated

19

physically and emotionally by his father when he was a

teenager, to the conclusion that therefore he will be

less dangerous in the future.
