ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In Neder versus United States, this Court

12

held that the omission of an offense element from petit

13

jury instructions can be harmless error, even though

14

that omission violates the Sixth Amendment right to a

15

jury trial.

16

applies to the omission of an offense element from a

17

grand jury's indictment.

18

Fifth Amendment, but it is harmless when the petit jury,

19

having been properly instructed on all of the elements

20

of the offense, returns a verdict of guilty beyond a

21

reasonable doubt.

22

Our submission is that the same analysis

Such an error violates the

23

works, but at the trial before a petit jury there's an

24

opportunity for counsel to object.

opportunity to object when the grand jury indictment

comes down.

2

Now, I guess you could move to quash.
MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct, Justice

3

Kennedy.

In fact, parties do move to dismiss

4

indictments for failure to allege all of the elements of

5

the offense.

6

erroneously denied by the trial judge.

7

under Ninth Circuit law, under the assumption that the

8

Ninth Circuit has properly interpreted the law, should

9

have concluded that this indictment failed to allege the

That happened here.

The motion was
The trial judge,

10

substantial step that was part of the attempt.

11

the judge had done that, then the Government would have

12

gotten back to the grand jury and obtained a superseding

13

indictment.

14

And if

Instead what the judge did was deny the

15

motion, finding that the indictment itself was

16

sufficient, and then instructed the jury on all of the

17

elements that the Ninth Circuit requires as part of this

18

offense.

19

a reasonable doubt finding that the attempt did involve

20

a substantial step towards the completion of the

21

offense.

22

And so we have now a petit jury verdict beyond

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the problem that the

23

motion to quash is going to be made, if counsel is on

24

his toes, is going to be made at the beginning of the

25

trial?

And we want to induce the court to look very
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

carefully at it at that point, because if the court is

2

wrong, somebody has to go through an entire trial as a

3

result of it.

4

very careful at the beginning is to say, this is not

5

harmless error, and you've got to take this very

6

seriously and you can't take any chance on the, in

7

effect, the evidence saving you in harmless error

analysis later.

9

And the way to induce the court to be

10

Souter, motions like this are typically made long in

11

advance of trial, as this one was.

JUSTICE SOUTER:
right.

Waiting until the

Well, I'm sure that's

But that simply reinforces my point.
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think what it

16

reinforces is that the judge has enough time to look at

17

it and conscientiously attempt to get the law right

18

without the need for the court to apply the heavy hand

19

of automatic reversal.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you concede that the

21

error would always be harmless if you have a trial

22

before a petit jury, and all of the elements are

23

instructed to be found by the jury?

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that is

our position.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That doesn't

2

necessarily make sense.

You can imagine a situation

3

where the probable cause and the eventual evidence that

4

supports guilt is adduced after the indictment and the

5

prosecutor says, you know, we're going to find that

6

evidence once we get into it, we don't have it now, but

7

indict anyway without it.

8

In other words, what's your response to the

9

situation where there's no probable cause on an element

10

at the time of the indictment, but that evidence is

11

later adduced and is a sufficient basis to convict?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

My response, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, is the same response that this Court gave in

14

United States versus Mechanik, where it was confronted

15

with an analogous problem.

16

violation of the rule that allowed two witnesses to

17

testify at the same time before the grand jury.

18

And that was in that case, a

And the Court was specifically confronted

19

with the question:

Was this harmless error because the

20

petit jury has now found guilt beyond a reasonable

21

doubt?

22

to that answer, it said, we could logically be persuaded

23

that what we're supposed to do is compare the evidence

24

in front of the grand jury to the error and see whether

25

the error was prejudicially consequential for the grand

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me, you mean you can

6

never decide this question until after the trial is

7

completed and you see whether the jury convicts beyond a

8

reasonable doubt?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Scalia, the

10

district court should decide this question in advance of

11

trial when it's properly raised and, if the indictment

12

is defective, dismiss it.

that trial judges don't need incentives of an automatic

reversal rule to get them to comply with the law.

Mr. Dreeben, this touches on

4

what troubles me about this.

5

answer the generic question that you presented, whether

6

the omission of an element of a criminal offense from

7

the indictment can constitute harmless error, without

8

considering the nature of the alleged defect here.

9

I wonder whether we can

I don't know how you can answer -- if you

look at whether the alleged defect here is susceptible

11

to harmless error analysis, or whether if we were to

12

agree with you, in fact, it is harmless, how you can

13

answer those questions without reaching a conclusion

14

about whether there was any defect in the indictment in

15

took a substantial step towards the completion of that

7

crime, to wit he approached the border and came to the

8

guard and presented false identifications to the guard

9

and lied about his intended destination.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you went back to the -

11

if you went back to the very demanding nineteenth

12

century criminal pleading laws, criminal pleading laws,

13

they would say that where you use a legal term that has

14

a well-0established meaning such as attempt, you don't

15

need to spell out the definition of that, of that

16

concept.

17

Ninth Circuit has done is to resurrect, you know, to go

18

back to something that's more demanding than would have

19

been required in a nineteenth century indictment and

20

frame that as a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

21

It's enough to use the term.

MR. DREEBEN:

So what the

because indictments are not always written perfectly.

properly read into a statute, we do face the situation

5

where -

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, it's not

2

unusual for this Court to decide a case where the

3

Government does not challenge the underlying

4

constitutional ruling and make some remedial argument.

5

Two very notable examples are United States versus Leon,

6

where the Government did not challenge the underlying

7

Fourth Amendment claim that was found to be valid by the

8

lower court, but instead simply asked for a modification

9

of the exclusionary rule; and another example is Rose

10

versus Clark, which involves a fairly analogous issue to

11

this one, whether it can be harmless error to fail to

12

incorporate into the jury instructions the actual

13

element and instead rely on a mandatory rebuttable

14

presumption.

15

whether the instruction violated the Constitution.

Court didn't decide it.

17

the remedial question of harmless error, which is an

important question and I submit doesn't change in

character depending on the nature of the underlying

error.

MR. DREEBEN:

It may have a different

5

atmosphere, but I don't think that it has any different

6

legal analysis behind it.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

A judge's reaction to a

8

case is often affected by just exactly what's involved.

9

And here it's just hard to see how anyone could claim

10

any particular prejudice out of the error in this

11

particular case or, really, it's arguable that there's

12

no defect in the indictment at all because it was

submission here is that with respect to the probable

21

cause determination, there is no prejudice because of

22

the petit jury's verdict.

would acknowledge that a defendant could argue that the

defect in a grand jury indictment in a particular case

could fail to give him adequate notice such that he

Justice Breyer, I think that

21

an empirical perspective might be helpful here.

22

think an empirical perspective, if you look around the

23

circuits and you see the number of issues, cases, in

which this issue is raised, it becomes clear that there

25

are a large number of situations in which mistakes get

made.

2

I mean, we're talking about a Federal system

3

here in which 70 to 80,000 cases are indicted a year.

4

Mistakes will happen, and they will happen both by the

5

trial judge and by the prosecutor.

6

And there will be situations in which the

7

circuits change the law or the interpretation of the law

8

after the decision in question.

9

good example of that, where the Ninth Circuit extended

I think that this is a

10

its prior precedents to find that an indictment that

11

didn't allege the overt act was inadequate.

12

And then the Government is stuck, and the

13

rule of automatic reversal, which the Court may appear

14

to think in this case is particularly disproportionate

15

since the indictment looks fine, functions identically

16

even if there's a conceded violation that every member

17

of the Court would say yes, there's a missing element

18

here.

19

The fundamental problem is that the grand

20

jury sits to decide probable cause.

21

whether the defendant is actually guilty.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It does not decide

Well, it sits to

23

decide whether people should be indicted, and yes,

24

they're supposed to determine whether there's probable

25

cause, but historically a significant role for the grand
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jury has been not to indict people even though the

2

Government had the evidence to indict them.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I actually do not agree

4

that there's any stronger evidence, Mr. Chief Justice,

5

that grand juries didn't indict when the Government had

6

adequate evidence than there is historical evidence that

7

petit juries did not convict when there's proof beyond a

8

reasonable doubt.

9

historical instances in which grand juries and petit

In both instances, you can point to

10

juries played a role of in effect nullifying when there

11

was adequate evidence.

12

But it's clear from the Neder decision that

13

that history has not led to the conclusion that this

14

Court cannot evaluate petit jury defects for

15

harmlessness, and the same conclusion ought to be true a

16

fortiori for the grand jury.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The trouble with your a

18

fortiori argument it seems to me is this:

19

your argument, then whenever a judge is asked to rule on

20

a motion to quash, if the judge is in any doubt, the

21

judge is going to be induced by your rule to deny the

22

motion to quash and wait and see what happens at trial.

23

And if in fact they get to trial and they don't prove

24

the element, then it can either be thrown out because an

25

element has not been proven or he can go back and revive
17
Alderson Reporting Company

If we accept

Official

1

the motion to quash.

2

If on the other hand the Government gets its

3

act together at that point and does put in evidence on

4

the element, it's going to be harmless error.

5

the price of, it seems to me, of your rule is that

6

someone will always be put to trial if there is any

7

question about how the judge should rule on the motion

8

to quash, whereas if we go the other way the judge will

9

grant the motion to quash and the Government can go back

10

to the grand jury and get another indictment.

11
12

And so

It seems to me that something is seriously
lost in that situation if we go your way.

13

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Souter,

14

experience doesn't show that, in fact, district courts

15

don't grant these motions.

They grant them, as Justice

19

doubtful case or the judge who can't make up his mind.

20

Under your rule the price of that uncertainty is always

21

going to be to subject somebody to trial.

22

But I'm concerned about the, we'll say, the

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I do think we can assume

23

that Article III judges are a hearty enough species so

24

that they can make up their minds and they can rule.

25

But to the extent that there is a risk here that judges
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

might reserve the motion, that is the same risk that the

2

Court fessed up to and acknowledged in the Mechanik

3

case, where in fact the judge did reserve the motion.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it seems to me that the

5

prejudice to the defendant in the two -- as between the

6

two situations simply is not comparable.

7

In Mechanik you had a situation in which two

8

witnesses putting in whatever evidence they were putting

9

in were in the jury room and, yes, one could influence

10

the other, et cetera.

11

situation in which it may very well be that the

12

defendant should never be put to trial at all.

13

rule says if there's any question about it, put him to

14

Do we know -- do we have

They will, of course, be compromised at the trial stage

5

if witnesses testify and the testimony is turned over in

6

that context.

7

There are important values in grand jury secrecy.

But more important than the practical aspect

8

is exactly the logic that the Court used in Mechanik.

9

The point of the grand jury indictment is to determine

10

is there enough to take this person to trial.

11

person has been taken to trial and been found guilty

12

beyond a reasonable doubt, we know that if the

13

Government went back to the grand jury it would be able

14

to get an indictment.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Once the

How far would you go with

16

the Mechanik logic?

Suppose that someone is charged by

17

information with a felony without the person's consent

18

and for some reason the trial judge refuses to dismiss

19

the information and then the person is convicted.

20

you say that because the petit jury returned a verdict

21

that the fact that the person was charged with a felony

22

by information calls for no remedy?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Would

No, I would not go that far,

24

Justice Alito.

I would draw the same line that this

25

Court drew in the Midland Asphalt case where it was

looking at a somewhat analogous problem of an

2

interlocutory appeal and the same line that it drew in

3

Neder itself.

4

directs a verdict of guilty, that's an impermissible act

5

and it cannot be rendered harmless no matter how

6

overwhelming the evidence is.

7

In Neder the Court said if the judge

In the Midland Asphalt case, this Court

8

dealt with whether the language of the Fifth Amendment

9

created a right not to be tried.

And it does say "No

10

person shall be held to answer absent an indictment

11

issued by a grand jury," and the Court said if you have

12

a defect that causes an indictment not to be an

13

indictment or, as in your hypothetical, Justice Alito,

14

no indictment at all, or if you have a defect that

15

causes the grand jury not to be a grand jury, those are

16

the kind of fundamental errors that would give rise to a

17

right not to be tried such that you could take an appeal

18

before trial, an interlocutory appeal.

19
20

And I would submit that the same kind of
principle would apply here.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it's just a

22

metaphysical inquiry, when is an indictment not an

23

indictment?

fundamentally unfair or, from the Sixth amendment,

It's not some other standard of what's

The petit jury is an independent institutional body.

13

The function of the grand jury is not only to find

14

probable cause, rightly or wrongly, but the function of

the grand jury is also to select the charge.

16

specifically since your decision in Recuenco versus

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's exactly what I -- I

sufficient if you have bank robbery you say on October

such and such, where there is a bank, the defendant

walked into the bank and he, he attempted or he did by

force or threat of force, take property belonging to

11

someone else, or whatever it is, and that that would be

sufficient.

it consist of a knife, or a gun, or a fist.

relevant here?

Well, it's clearly

He rode a bicycle instead of walking.
MR. BAGGOT:

Well, he's given notice that

he's approaching the border with intent to commit this
crime.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

So here you've got notice

12

he made an attempt, but you didn't tell us whether he

13

rode the bicycle or he walked.

14

MR. BAGGOT:

But then the question becomes

15

is it material, is the variance material, is it far off

16

from what alleged?

17

Here nothing was alleged.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

See, the problem I'm

18

trying to think through is why should there be a

19

different rule between those two situations.

20

to me they're equally likely to produce prejudice or

21

lack of notice and a failure to comply with the letter

of the Constitution.

2

this cannot be treated as a simple variance.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

But why isn't your answer

3

to Justice Stevens that in the case in which there is no

4

allegation of an element at all there isn't a sufficient

5

indictment to charge him for anything, whereas in the

6

case of the variance on your theory, as I understand it,

7

there is an indictment and the question is simply

8

whether he was misled by the variance and prejudiced?

9
10

MR. BAGGOT:

Right.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So why isn't the answer is

11

in one case there's an indictment, and in the other case

12

there isn't?

13

MR. BAGGOT:

Well, the extent is -- it's a

14

question that can't be answered in the abstract.

15

question of how material the variance was.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's a

No, but why isn't your

17

answer to him that in the case in which there is a

18

variance you have an indictment; in the case that you're

19

talking about there is none?

20

on that is that I thought the essence of your case was

21

that there is no indictment here, i.e., the grand jury

22

function has not been performed and he is entitled to

23

the grand jury function before he goes to trial.

your position, then I would have thought your answer to

understand your case.

MR. BAGGOT:

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. BAGGOT:

Under such an indictment, under

2

this case he could not, because he was under the

3

constant surveillance of the INS at the time and in law

4

that is not a legal indictment, not a legal reentry, an

5

illegal reentry.

6

and that's why they charged the attempt, to avoid these

7

questions of whether he was under the constant control

8

and surveillance of the immigration authorities, which

9

he was.

10

He never got by secondary.

So that's why the

charge was attempt as opposed to unlawful entry.

11

It's one of those quirks in the law,

JUSTICE ALITO:

But in that situation, you

wouldn't know what the substantial step was, would you?

MR. BAGGOT:

No, and -

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

The indictment wouldn't tell

15

you what the substantial step was.

MR. BAGGOT:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What does that mean, if

you're tried for illegal entry and the Government

doesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under

So why does the Ninth Circuit think this one

8

you have to spell out, but all the other words you don't

10

MR. BAGGOT:

Well, that's why they had an en

11

banc determination, because the judges were in disarray

12

over that question.

13

the en banc decision in the Ninth Circuit,

14

Gracidas-Ulibarry, had established concretely that the

intent of the legislature was to incorporate the common

law meaning of the word "attempt."

from anything else.

7

8

subject of conviction even though it's not explicitly

set forth in the indictment.

That doesn't distinguish attempt
And my understanding is if you're

10

MR. BAGGOT:

Yes, that's correct.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if that is the case

12

here, then it seems to me he could have been convicted

13

of attempt without ever having had set forth in the

14

indictment the overt act that you demand.

15

MR. BAGGOT:

Well, that's a good point.

But

16

under our -- all I can tell you, Justice Scalia, is that

17

under our case law the attempt is considered a

18

substantive offense.

19

That's been the law -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

is one thing.

it couldn't be a lesser included because it's subject to

the same punishment.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Dreeben, is attempt a

22

lesser included offense of the substantive offense of

23

illegal reentry?

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:
It is an attempt offense.

It's a substantive offense.
I wouldn't necessarily
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

describe it as lesser included, but Rule 31 of the

2

Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure does allow a trial

3

judge to submit an attempt offense to the petit jury

4

when attempt is a violation of the substantive law.

5

I should say that the Government's position

6

is that there does not need to be a separate charge of

7

attempt in the indictment in order to permit Rule 31 to

8

operate, but there is a circuit split over whether

9

lesser included offenses can be submitted to the jury

10

unless they are included in the indictment.

11

So we're not operating under a uniform rule

12

that would always allow us to do that, and I'm not sure

13

which way the Ninth Circuit goes on that, although I

14

could hazard a guess.

15

(Laughter.)

16

The problem that we have here is that we are

17

living under a rule of law in the Ninth Circuit and in

18

at least one other circuit that forces the Government to

19

pay a tremendous penalty when a mistake is made in an

20

indictment, and it does happen.

failure to dismiss -- state elements, but they don't get
