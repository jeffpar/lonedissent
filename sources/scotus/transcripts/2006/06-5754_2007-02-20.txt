Mr. Cochran.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS N. COCHRAN
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. COCHRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under the system described in

12

Justice Breyer's opinion for the Court in Booker, judges

13

would no longer be tied to the sentencing range

14

indicated in the guidelines.

15

passage from this Court's recent decision in Cunningham

16

versus California.

17

case to reiterate in strong enforceable terms that it

18

meant what it said in Booker, that the guidelines are

19

merely advisory provisions.

20

that the guidelines deserve a presumption of

21

reasonableness was nothing more than an unfounded claim

22

put forth to justify its efforts to try and thwart the

23

Booker decision.

That, of course, was a

Mr. Rita is asking the Court in this

The Government's assertion

24

The ink wasn't given a chance to dry on the

25

Booker decision before the Department of Justice issued
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a memo to all of its Federal prosecutors directing that

2

they adhere to the guidelines and that they seek

3

sentences within the guidelines in all but extraordinary

4

cases.

5

The district court below in this case did

6

not treat the guidelines as advisory when it imposed a

7

33-month within guideline sentence.

8

did not consider Mr. Rita's military record, the fact

9

that he had been a combat soldier in two wars.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The district court

How can you say that,

11

given that at the sentencing hearing, that military

12

record was brought out, his physical ailments were

13

brought out, his activity in law enforcement, all that

14

was brought out?

15

the defense attorney to make the case clearer when it

16

was presented.

17

And indeed, the judge was assisting

MR. COCHRAN:

In the district court,

18

Mr. Rita did put forward evidence of his military

19

records, health concerns, he -- the district court

20

received that information.

21

consider that information because there's nothing in the

22

record where the district judge weighed any of that

23

information to determine what -- what effect to give any

24

of it.

25

The district court did not

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, you know, you don't

2

them, and the district court would hear all the

3

arguments and write down the word denied.

4

mean he didn't consider the arguments?

5

common thing.

6

all the arguments.

7

in the file.

8

there, and the judge says, on balance, I'm going to go

9

apply the guidelines.

10

I used to get

That's a very

So how can you say he didn't

consider them?

11

MR. COCHRAN:

Justice Breyer, the district

12

judge didn't say that we're going to weigh all of the

13

stuff, and I -

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, he doesn't in a summary

15

judgment case either.

16

them, I used to, I think, where they just wrote denied.

17

That was the opinion.

18

I mean, I've had quite a few of

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, in the instance of a

19

summary judgment matter, we don't have 3553(c), that

20

requires the district court to state in open court in

21

front of the defendant the reasons for the imposition of

22

sentence.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

are these.

Now, he says the reasons

Would that be sufficient?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. COCHRAN:

It would not, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not?

What in the

3

statute or the law or the Constitution says that a

4

district judge, although it might be good form in a

5

difficult case to write more, but I've often written

6

opinions where I say, and the remaining arguments we

7

feel are not sufficient to change the result.

8

means I don't think they're that great an argument, and

9

I don't answer every single one.

10

MR. COCHRAN:

That

With regard to the first

11

question Your Honor posed, it's not sufficient for the

12

district court to simply state conclusions, which is

13

what happened in this case, that -

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where in the law does it

say that?

16

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, in 3553(c), it requires

17

that the judge give the reasons for the imposition of

18

the particular sentence.

19
20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
that.

It says shall consider.

21

MR. COCHRAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Where -- I'm looking at
Am I missing something?

The preamble states Can you give me your page

MR. COCHRAN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor, on page

Alderson Reporting Company

It states,

Official - Subject to Final Review

"the court at the time of sentencing shall state in open

court the reasons for its imposition of the particular

sentence."

4

district court to explain the facts that the court is

5

relying on to impose the particular sentence in the

6

case.

7

And that's what we contend requires the

JUSTICE BREYER:

So it isn't sufficient, in

8

your view, that the judge just says, the reason I

9

imposed this sentence is that's the guideline sentence,

10
11

and I think in this circumstance it's reasonable?
MR. COCHRAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

12

Because the guidelines don't take into account all the

13

myriad facts, and in this case, did not take into

14

account the military record, the employment record,

15

Mr. Rita's health concerns.

16

did not take those into account.

17

The guidelines specifically

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think these other factors

18

that have been brought out, while they're serious

19

factors, I don't think they're enough to warrant a

20

different sentence.

Suppose he adds those words?

21

MR. COCHRAN:

Your Honor, I think the -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I'm worried about

23

basically is, I don't think in the law there's a special

24

category that requires a judge to give special reasons

25

in a guideline case.

I think it's the same as any other
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

matter.

Judges do normally give reasons.

And I'd worry

2

a bit about creating a special situation where district

3

judges have to do something unusual.

4

MR. COCHRAN:

I don't think that this is

5

unusual, Your Honor.

6

the rationale for imposing the sentence, and not only

7

does it have to do so in court, in front of the

8

defendant, so the defendant understands the sentence

9

that he is receiving -

10

I think the court has to explain

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I get where you're

11

going.

Can I say this in an opinion, would this satisfy

12

you?

13

normally give reasons.

14

arguments with reasons, and it's the same here.

15

that satisfy you?

And of course, like any other matter, judges do

16

MR. COCHRAN:

They do normally reject
Would

I think it would have to be

17

specific to the issues raised by the parties.

18

this case, at a minimum, the judge would have to address

19

the three issues that Mr. Rita put forward and discuss

20

those:

21

concerns.

22

Government would raise, and any issues that the district

23

judge was considering that maybe neither party had

24

raised to the court as well.

25

And in

His military record, his employment, his health
It would have to address any issues that the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How do you reconcile the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

language in the prologue of (c) which says, the court

2

shall state the reasons, with (c)(2), which says that if

3

the sentence is not of the kind or is outside the range

4

described in (a)(4) of the guidelines, the court shall

5

state the specific reason for the imposition of a

6

sentence different from the guidelines?

7

Now, this seems to set up some dichotomy

8

between giving reasons and giving the specific reason.

9

Where does that line fall in your estimation?

10

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, I think foremost, Your

11

Honor, is that that provision came about prior to the

12

Booker decision when the guidelines were mandatory.

13

what that addresses and what it was meant to address was

14

if the court were to depart, then it was -- it needed to

15

explain that departure in a greater reason to enable the

16

sentencing commission to take that information into

17

account in revising the guidelines.

18

And

That is still a purpose with the sentencing

19

commission, to revise the guidelines, and they can still

20

use that information.

21

need information from the sentencing judge about each of

22

the matters that he or she -

23

But it -- at the very least, we

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You haven't answered my

24

question.

I mean, you explain why it's put in there,

25

but I want to know what is the difference between giving
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the reasons and giving the specific reason.

2

MR. COCHRAN:

The specific reason I think,

3

Your Honor, is so that the sentencing commission can

4

take that information into account in later revisions of

5

the guidelines.

6

statute was passed.

7

That was the purpose at the point that

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But are you saying now that

8

that distinction should be ignored?

9

MR. COCHRAN:

I don't know, Your Honor, if

10

it's so much that it should be ignored inasmuch as the

11

district court needs to give as many reasons, or as

12

clear a reason for the imposition of the particular

13

sentence.

14

That will help JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it sounds to me as

15

though you want all the reasons to be specific.

16

I understand your argument.

17

argument, then the distinction between reason and

18

specific reason basically is going to be a matter of

19

history, and perhaps it should be.

20

MR. COCHRAN:

I mean,

But if we accept that

It, it may, Your Honor.

And,

21

and because that provision predated this Court's Booker

22

decision, it still holds relevance but not nearly the

23

relevance it had when the guidelines were mandatory.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So your position would

be, Mr. Cochran, that the obligation to be even-handed

6

He didn't express any remorse.

MR. COCHRAN:

He accused a

All that, he would have to

Your Honor, I think that the

7

Court certainly could consider all of that; and -- and

8

if pressed by the Government would need to consider

9

that.

10
11
12
13

But certainly at a minimum, the Court needs to

-JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't that what the

Government pressed at the sentencing hearing?
MR. COCHRAN:

It did, Your Honor, and again

14

the district court never came out with any specifics

15

regarding any of those issues other than the conclusion

16

that it felt that the guideline range was not

17

inappropriate.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the district court

19

says I give these following -- I've considered these

20

following specific factors.

21

consistency and nationwide uniformity that the

22

guidelines strive to achieve is of great importance; and

23

for that reason, I'm following the guidelines?

24

MR. COCHRAN:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in my view, the

I don't Is that an inappropriate

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

judgment for the district court to make?

2

MR. COCHRAN:

I think it's inappropriate,

3

Your Honor, because while there should be uniformity in

4

an attempt to move in that direction, uniformity is not

5

the end all and be all.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not the end all.

Suppose the district judge said I think this is of great

10

importance.

You don't think that the Booker opinion -

11

or do you think the Booker opinion rejected uniformity

12

and consistency as an important factor?

13

MR. COCHRAN:

14

decision rejected that, Your Honor.

15

Booker opinion said was that for there to be advisory

16

guidelines, for there to be constitutional sentencing

17

practices, then uniformity is going to have to give way

18

to some extent.

19

I don't believe the Booker
What I believe the

At least at the very beginning.

Once the district courts apply the 3553(a)

20

factors, and go through the statute, and consider the

21

guidelines, the district courts will then explain their

22

rationale; and then that rationale will be -- in our

23

opinion, will show where the shortcomings of the

24

guidelines are.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Cochran, are you arguing
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the sentencing in this case violated the Sixth

2

Amendment?

3

MR. COCHRAN:

Not as it was applied.

It

4

came close in the sense that the district court was

5

laboring, in our opinion, under the belief that the

6

guidelines held some control.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it didn't violate the

8

Sixth Amendment, then your argument is based on the

9

Sentencing Reform Act?

10

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, it came -- it may have

11

violated the Sixth Amendment.

12

concede that.

13

we analyzed this under the statute, clearly the district

14

court didn't comply with the statute.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

I don't know that I would

But to avoid any constitutional issue, if

You can't say whether it did

or did not violate the Sixth Amendment?
MR. COCHRAN:

The district court held the

guidelines to a greater quantum than simply advisory.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, was your client's

20

sentence enhanced by any fact that should have been

21

submitted to the jury?

22

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, under -- under a pure

23

advisory system -- and I think Your Honor is addressing

24

the cross-reference in this matter -- in a purely

25

advisory system, the guidelines were calculated
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

correctly in Mr. Rita's case, because under a purely

2

advisory system, the district court could look at that

3

cross-reference, understand that it came about from

4

uncharged and unproven conduct, and disregard it.

5

But by not doing so in this case, and that

6

cross enhancement doubled his effective guideline range,

7

then this case may very well be unconstitutional because

8

of the extra weight that the court gave the guidelines.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Cochran, you do

10

contend, do you not, that if the guidelines had been

11

mandatory, there would have been a violation of the

12

Sixth Amendment.

13

MR. COCHRAN:

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

Because of the, the

accessory after the fact point.

16
17

No question, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's right, Your Honor,

absolutely.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then the question

19

ultimately is, does it violate the Sixth Amendment to

20

say that we have a presumption there, a sentence is in

21

the guidelines as a reasonable -- if you're an appellate

22

court judge.

23

Amendment?

And you think it does violate the Sixth

24

MR. COCHRAN:

Our position is that the

25

presumption does violate the Sixth 14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

Then I guess the argument

2

of the other side, which I would like you to address, is

3

that, in which there -- we didn't think it violated the

4

of Sixth Amendment if the district judge simple applied

5

3553 -- uh, 3553(a).

6

all of these things that go into the guidelines; it make

7

a big point of that in 3553(a).

And of course, 3553(a) includes

MR. COCHRAN:

Can you say it is an

initial benchmark?
MR. COCHRAN:

I don't -- when we start

establishing benchmarks and presumptions, I think that's
where we, we JUSTICE KENNEDY:
Presumption is bad.

So benchmarks are bad.

Great weight, that's bad?

13

MR. COCHRAN:

14

it's just another thing to consider.

15

That's bad, too.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I think

Does it matter what

16

judge did in other cases?

17

before he said, well, the guidelines say this, but I

18

think this case is different, so I'm going to depart,

19

and the day after he says I know what the guidelines

20

are, but I'm going to impose a higher sentence?

21

I mean, if we look on the day

I mean, how do we know he's -- when he says

22

I looked at the guidelines and I think they're

23

appropriate, that he's considering himself bound by

24

something that he may or may not agree with, as opposed

25

to what he said?

Which is, well, I cannot find that
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

they're inappropriate?
MR. COCHRAN:

And what that tells me,

3

Mr. Chief Justice, is that, that the district court felt

4

that the guidelines had a center of gravity, that the

5

judge was bound -- in other words, shifted the burden to

6

the defendant to say, well, I -- unless you can show

7

that these are inappropriate, that it is a setting of a

8

benchmark, it's a drawing of a line, and we contend that

9

that is what the Sixth Amendment prohibits.

10

If the guidelines are advisory, if they are

11

but one of many factors to be considered, together with

12

all of the other factors in 3553(a), the court can use

13

that information, can use that reference.

14

starts putting any greater weight on the guidelines -

15

and the statute doesn't admit to that.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But once it

How about the point that

17

Justice Breyer made that these other factors have been

18

taken into account by the sentencing commission because

19

Congress told them to consider those same factors?

MR. COCHRAN:

I'm not, Your Honor.

presumably eliminate any Sixth Amendment problem with

13

the district court's findings of fact.

14

But the district court's sentence is going

15

to go on appeal.

16

it for reasonableness, let's assume in this case the

17

appellate -- the appellate court says oh, no, this

18

person had -- we find as a matter of fact, given the

19

record, military service, you know, which we think

20

should have been taken into account.

21

set it aside.

22

And the appellate court in reviewing

And, therefore, we

Now, the next case that comes up, which

23

doesn't have the element of military service, in all

24

other respects the same as your client's case, it comes

25

up to the court of appeals, and the court of appeals
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would say, ah, we don't have that different fact here

2

and therefore we affirm the sentence.

3

Isn't -- in other words isn't the finding of

4

a fact necessary for the process of judicial review,

5

even if it is not made necessary for the purposes of the

6

district court's determination?

7

sentence but for this fact.

8
9

MR. COCHRAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And -

10
11

He would not get that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you haven't shown us a

way out of the problem.

12

MR. COCHRAN:

In a purely advisory system,

13

the district court is bound by the statutory minimum and

14

maximum.

15

the Court is bound simply by that statutory minimum and

16

maximum, then the factual finding as to where within

17

that is up to the district court.

18

And as this Court has said in Cunningham, if

It's only when we establish thresholds as

19

the guidelines do we run into the constitutional

20

problem.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, even if you don't -

22

don't establish thresholds by reason of the guideline,

23

you are establishing thresholds upon judicial review,

24

guidelines or not.

25

If the -- if the appellate court says, oh,
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

given there's this fact in this case, the sentence below

2

was reasonable, but in the next case, where that fact

3

does not exist, the court of appeals says, ah, the

4

sentence is unreasonable, in other words, that fact is

5

made a necessary condition for giving the higher

6

sentence.

7

So you haven't -- you haven't solved the

8

problem of the, of the apparent conflict between -

9

between Booker and the advisory guidelines.

10

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, I think so long as the

11

district court can evaluate and consider and potentially

12

reject what the guidelines say, just as the Court can

13

consider the effect of -- of the person's military

14

record, Mr. Rita was a combat veteran in two wars, which

15

is separate and apart from someone who may have been an

16

Army recruiter -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're not focusing on my

18

point.

I concede that the district court is free as a

19

bird -- free as a bird -- but you have appellate review.

20

And the appellate court in reviewing for reasonableness

21

is going to make a particular fact determinative of

22

whether this sentence can stand or not.

23

right?

24

MR. COCHRAN:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that

It is.
And that's going to be a

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

problem.
MR. COCHRAN:

I think what the court would

3

have -- the appellate court would have to do is evaluate

4

all of that through the prism of 3553(a).

5

sentence that was imposed the least sufficient sanction

6

that the court below could have imposed.

7

for whatever reasons, vacate it and return it back to

8

the district court.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is the

And if not,

Counsel, what if

10

there weren't guidelines at all, and the district court

11

said maybe, you know, it's new, I want to see what other

12

judges have done; he presses a button on the computer,

13

give me what the sentences were looking at these facts,

14

and finds out in the last 100 cases, this is what the

15

sentence was.

16

than those and that's the sentence I'm going to impose.

17

Is there any problem with that?

18
19
20

And he says this seems to me no different

MR. COCHRAN:

There is.

And again, because

3553(a) is an individual weighing of the defendant CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, well, he looks

21

at all the individual factors and he says they seem not

22

terribly different from these 100 other cases and the

23

range in those 100 other cases was, you know, 5 to 7

24

years, and so I'm going to give him 5 years.

25

MR. COCHRAN:

If the district court
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

considers all those facts and considers what may have

2

been done and it is sufficient, if not greater than

3

necessary given those facts, then the court can do that.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is that

5

different than the -- how is that different than looking

6

at the guidelines, which did that in a much more

7

comprehensive way, and saying, I don't see anything

8

different in this case from the normal guidelines case

9

and so I'm going to impose that sentence?

10

MR. COCHRAN:

Well, the guidelines didn't

11

take everything into account, and the sentencing courts

12

were coming from 18 years of mandatory guidelines, of

13

being required to follow this book that necessarily

14

didn't incorporate all of the human factors in

15

sentencing.

16

And they have held to that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it did incorporate

17

them in that district judges were free to depart from

18

the guidelines if indeed they found there was some one

19

of these human factors not considered by the guidelines

20

which existed in the particular case.

21

MR. COCHRAN:

In theory, yes,

22

Justice Scalia.

But in practice, no, because what

23

happened in the very cases as United States versus Foy

24

out of the Ninth Circuit, the defendant in that case

25

argued to the district court that he should have a
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

departure based upon lack of mutual guidance, and it was

2

a reasoned decision.

3

Ninth Circuit found it to be a reasoned decision; and

4

within the next amendment process of the Sentencing

5

Commission, it was eliminated as a departure basis with

6

no discussion at all.

7

It went to the Ninth Circuit.

The

So yes, there may have been departures, but

8

they were systematically removed, and in fact chapters

9

5(h) and 5(a) show that very clearly.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, if they were

11

systematically removed then all of these other human

12

factors that you're complaining about were considered by

13

the guideline commission and were simply rejected.

14

MR. COCHRAN:

They weren't considered, Your

15

Honor, and in the history of those amendments that's

16

borne out.

17
18

And if the Court has no further questions,
I'd like to reserve some time.

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

presumption of reasonableness in reviewing the sentence

2

imposed pursuant to the advisory guidelines system that

3

this Court announced in United States versus Booker.

4

The guidelines represent the integration of the multiple

5

purposes of sentencing reflected in section 3553(a) that

6

the district court is obligated to consider.

fact patterns that arise in the Federal system and has

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The

Isn't it true, just to get

12

military service?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Stevens, the

16

commission considered that factor and then determined

17

that it was not generally appropriate to a sentence

18

outside the guidelines.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

under the guideline no weight is given to military

JUSTICE BREYER:

Are we back to the original

version, which I'll read what it says.

16

a few specific exceptions -- race, sex, national origin,

17

creed, religion, socioeconomic State -- with those

exceptions, the commission does not intend to limit the

your theory of it just to where we were when it started

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

out, before the commission started ruling all these

2

things out and began to make all its -- the judge could

3

do that.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

I think we're back,

5

Justice Breyer, to a further point even than the first

6

set of guidelines, because even under the first set of

7

guidelines application of the guidelines was mandatory

8

unless the court found an aggravating or mitigating

9

circumstance that wasn't taken into account.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

We said we took nothing

11

into account and therefore any circumstance that makes

12

the case unusual would be in principle a ground for an

13

exception.

14
15
16
17
18

MR. DREEBEN:

I understand that,

Justice Breyer.
JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying more than

that is necessary.
MR. DREEBEN:

I think that the

19

reconciliation of this Court's merits opinion in Booker

20

and its remedial opinion in Booker does dictate that the

21

judge has additional freedom to impose a sentence that's

22

different from what's described in the guidelines.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

He could do this:

He could

24

set aside the guideline on the theory that the guideline

25

itself is unreasonable, that is it doesn't properly take
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

account of sentencing.

2

Then, if you take your view that there's a presumption

3

in its favor and if it is the normal case, not an

4

unusual case in any respect, how can he not apply the

5

guideline?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

But suppose he doesn't do that.

Justice Breyer, I think we

7

have to distinguish between what the job of the district

8

court is and what the job of the appellate court is; and

9

in this case, the Government is arguing for a

10

presumption of reasonableness on appeal.

Once the

11

district judge has determined that the guidelines

12

sentence aligns with his own application of the section

13

3553(a) factors, our submission here is that a court of

14

appeals can generally presume that that is a reasonable

15

sentence.

16

or the Government if the Government has appealed, to

17

show that that presumption is overcome.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The defendant of course has the opportunity,

But unless there is a way

19

to calibrate the strength of the presumption, there's no

20

clear way to distinguish the presumption from the

21

mandate.

22

consider other things.

23

presumption in some way that says, you know, a mandate

24

was force 60 and a presumption is a force 40, something

25

like that, there's no way to tell the two apart in

The mandate is gone.

You say yes, they

But unless we can calibrate the

practice.
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, I'm not sure

3

that that would be true even if what we were talking

4

about was a direction to the district judge to presume

5

that he would impose a guidelines sentence.

6

not what we're talking about.

7

not operate and does not have to operate under the

8

position that we're arguing for with a presumption that

9

the judge will impose a guidelines sentence unless

But that's

The judge's obligation is to -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

He doesn't have to do it

unless he wants to be sure of being affirmed.
MR. DREEBEN:

I would think that what the

14

judge wants to do is be sure that he's complied with his

15

statutory obligations.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, perhaps I

17

misunderstood Justice Souter's question, but I have this

18

concern, and I thought it was his concern as well.

19

the appellate level, is the presumption something that

20

can only be overcome by a clear and convincing showing

21

or is it just an initial benchmark?

22

standards and words here.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At

We're playing with

Well, we are.
And when we talk about

presumptions at the appellate level, that's actually a

little strange in any event.

2

presumptions as assisting us in finding a fact.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

You usually talk about

That's true, Justice Kennedy.

4

But I think what it reflects at the appellate level is

5

that the court of appeals enters the case with an

6

attitude that, our job is to decide whether what the

7

district judge did was reasonable.

8
9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We can operate -

So we write that this is

an additive thing?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, I think that it's not so

11

different from the court of appeals saying we can enter

12

this case feeling pretty confident that we can affirm a

13

guidelines sentence unless the person who challenges

14

that shows us a good reason otherwise.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, is your view -- on

16

your view, is the appellate court engaging in some kind

17

of de novo review or is the appellate court supposed to

18

engage in a review that it will disturb the sentence

19

only if it is shown to be unreasonable?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

The latter, Justice Souter.

21

And I think that in that regard there is a range of

22

reasonable sentences that could be imposed based on a

23

given set of facts.

25

you have that, two criminals, criminal defendants, with

Isn't it clear that it

MR. DREEBEN:

Alderson Reporting Company

2

Congress wanted but not violate the Sixth Amendment.
Now, what I think we're talking about now -

3

I think -- i mean, you sort of shed some -- you

4

clarified something very well for me, which is that in

5

this case we're talking about the situation where the

6

district judge applies the guidelines sentence, and then

7

what's the attitude of the court on appeal, and the

8

attitude is going to be, well, the Sentencing Commission

9

thinks it's okay, the judge thinks it's okay, okay, you

10

have to -- you better show me a good reason to think to

11

the contrary.

12

Fine.

But the interesting problem is the problem

13

of the next case which you're now talking about, is,

14

well, what happens if the district judge and when should

15

be the district judge and how free should the district

16

judge feel he is to depart from the guidelines sentence

17

even if it's not an unusual case.

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Let me try to address that and

19

try to address Justice Alito's point about the question

20

of how much sentencing philosophy can be decreed by the

21

sentencing commission or Congress before a Sixth

22

Amendment problem arises.

23

As I understand this Court's sequence of

24

opinions from Apprendi leading up to the most recent

25

decision in Cunningham, if the law establishes a level
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of punishment that may be imposed based on the facts

2

found by the jury and says to the judge, judge, you may

3

not go above it unless you find a particular fact, that

4

fact is subject to the Sixth Amendment rule that the

5

Court has announced and must be found by a jury.

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or some fact, not

necessarily a particular fact.
MR. DREEBEN:

Any fact at all, as a matter

of fact is what the Court has said, although I

10

understand that to mean facts pertaining to the offense

11

and the offender, not facts about the world such as the

12

prevalence of crime.

13

Now, what that leads me to conclude is that

14

in order to escape the bright line rule that's been

15

announced in this sequence of cases, including Booker

16

itself and most recently Cunningham, a judge must be

17

able to look at the set of facts that the jury found,

18

determine what level of punishment would be advised by,

19

say, a guidelines system, and not be bound to impose

20

that level of punishment if the judge feels that a

21

different level of punishment is appropriate.

22

If that is a correct understanding of what

23

this Court has held, it necessarily implies that a judge

24

does have a certain amount of freedom in an advisory

25

guidelines system to disagree with what the Sentencing
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Commission has found, give the judge's reasons, and then

2

is subject to appellate review for the reasonableness of

3

that explanation and, the Government submits, subject to

4

a proportionality principle, so that the sentence that's

5

imposed outside the guidelines is a reasonable one and

6

not an arbitrary one.

7

Now, if I'm wrong about that and it is not

8

necessary for the court to have the legal freedom to be

9

able to disagree with what the Sentencing Commission

10

said, that would be very good from the Government's

11

perspective.

12

rules that are established by Booker, what an advisory

13

guidelines system requires is that the guidelines be

14

treated as advice rather than mandate.

15

guidelines have determined that military service is not

16

ordinarily relevant to the level of punishment, a judge

17

may determine in a particular case that he disagrees.

18

But as I understand the complementary

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So while the

20

is relevant, and he decides to impose a sentence a

little below the guidelines.

23

interest in uniformity and the court of appeals has

24

adopted a rule where they will presume a within

misunderstanding of what the court of appeals has said,

22

judge you're obligated to impose a guideline sentence.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, they didn't say

you're obligated, but you can be pretty sure you'll be

affirmed if you do impose within guidelines sentences.

them differently, and I might give great weight to

depart, we're going to reverse that as unreasonable?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I think

4

there's a difference between a sentence that varies from

5

what other judges would do and a sentence that is

6

unreasonable.

7

If the sentence that is different from what

8

other judges would do is not supported by a cogent and

9

coherent explanation, and it is unduly productive of

10

disparity because, say, it takes a guidelines range like

11

this one, of 33 months to 41 months, and the judge says

12

in my view military service means that this defendant

13

gets probation.

14

Or to take an example that's on the other

15

side, suppose that the judge says this defendant

16

actually didn't get any extra credit in his criminal

17

history for his prior crime, but he has been convicted

18

before of lying to the Government about his gun charges.

19

I'm now going to take him up to the statutory maximum or

20

near it and give him eight years.

21

circumstances a court of appeals can and should say,

22

hold on, this is a view that the district judge is

23

entitled to take on the merits.

24

greater weight to that factor, whether it's aggravating

25

or mitigating, than what the guidelines did, but not to

which disuniformity is the main principle.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not that complicated.

4

All that happens is the court of appeals says, look, in

5

the case of bank robberies we've discovered about 33

6

percent of the defendants in the typical case have been

7

in the Army.

8

armed services is not a reason, ordinary armed -

9

services in the military is not a reason for a

And therefore, we think that just ordinary

10

diminished sentence.

11

say it the other way, the absence of a military service

12

is a reason for having the higher sentence, put it any

13

way you want.

14

disagree with that, we're going to reverse you because

15

we think it's unreasonable.

Okay.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

courts of appeals can establish their own sub-legal

5

rules as -

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's not sub-legal rules.

9

the thing that as a similar case comes along, is you

decide it the same way.

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, if do you

that, what you have is each court of appeals functioning

as a sentencing commission.

You've simply

substituted stare decisis and the necessity of the

district court following circuit law for the guidelines.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Exactly.

JUSTICE BREYER:

unconstitutional because they make facts automatically

Mr. Dreeben, may I ask

you, please, to address a point that Mr. Cochran raised?

He pointed to the seriousness of the

Now if you look at the legal obligations
that the judge had under Section 3553(c) to explain

10

himself, the statute actually sets up a hierarchy of

11

three different levels of explanation.

12

case the judge is to state the reasons for the sentence.

13

Second, if the sentencing range is greater than 24

makes it entirely plausible to say that if a judge

The district judge is reviewed under an abuse of

presumption he got it right.

a presumption the district judge sentence is correct?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Is that correct?

There's

Well, Justice Stevens, our

position is more complicated than that, because within a

Government -

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why shouldn't there be

10

also the same presumption when it is outside the

11

guidelines range?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Because sentences that are

13

outside the guidelines range are more likely to be the

14

cause of or a source of unwarranted disparity than a

sentence within the range.

said the role of the court of appeals is, which is to

iron out sentencing differences, there is more

reason for the -

And that is why that if the

Well, do you think the

interest in uniformity, in same sentences across the

22

board is stronger than the interest in getting the

correct sentence for the particular defendant who's in

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, there isn't any one

correct sentence usually.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, there isn't.

But if

3

you say the district judge has broad discretion, which

4

he does, and the review is under abuse of discretion,

5

why should there not always be a presumption that the

6

district judge got it right?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Because there are more legal

8

elements that go into sentencing and sentencing review

9

than just those that you've named, Justice Stevens.

10

Section 3553(a) itself, which is the guidepost for

11

review, mandates that the district court consider the

12

guidelines, consider the policy -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but it's sort of like

14

findings of fact.

15

sorts of aspects of the case, and you have a strong

16

presumption that the findings of fact are accurate.

17

don't you have a strong presumption that the ultimate

18

judgment on the sentence is also accurate?

19

They must take into consideration all

MR. DREEBEN:

Why

What happens when a sentence

20

is imposed outside the range is that there is a greater

21

risk of infringing the main purpose of the Sentencing

22

Reform Act, which was to avoid unwarranted disparities;

23

and in contrast to a sentence within the range which

24

does not merely run that risk to the same degree, a

25

sentence outside the range may well.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

It's different

Official - Subject to Final Review

from what the sentencing commission with its expertise

2

and its experience has recommended as the appropriate

3

sentence, given those facts.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you're -- I mean,

5

this is a self fulfilling prophecy.

You're saying if

you don't comply with the guidelines, you're not going

to have uniformity.

advisory?

Is that

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11

as that, Justice Scalia.

12

further that a sentence diverges from the guidelines

13

range, the greater the possibility of unwarranted

14

disparity; and as a result of that, a court of appeals

15

should look more critically at the reasons that the

16

district court gave and ensure that the constellation of

17

reasons and facts that's presented is not so likely to

18

be a disproportionate sentence than -

I wouldn't put it as strongly
What I would say is that the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

inconsistent with the notion which I think is correct,

21

that the district judge can simply disagree with the

basic -- basic reasons of the commission, can simply

disagree with the fact that the commission considers

white collar crime, for example, something that should

justify incarceration.

17

If you've got a submission here

MR. DREEBEN:

It wouldn't be identical but I

agree with you, Mr. Chief Justice, that a sentence

19

within the guidelines can be unreasonable if there is a

20

compelling case for a sentence outside the range because

21

the guidelines simply don't fit in that circumstance.

The sentencing commission itself recognized

that the guidelines were generalizations; they carved

out a heartland in the language of the sentencing
