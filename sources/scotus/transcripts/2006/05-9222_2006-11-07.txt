ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FISHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
In Sharp versus Pain, the Ninth Circuit

11

opinion that first decided the question that's before

12

you today, the Ninth Circuit said, and I'm quoting:

13

"The rule of Blakely that the statutory maximum is the

14

maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the

15

basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict, was

16

not clear until the Blakely decision itself."

17

Circuit is simply wrong.

18

decision it laid down precisely that rule.

19

of that decision this Court described the statutory

20

maximum concept as, quote, "the maximum a defendant

21

would receive if punished according to the facts

22

reflected in the jury verdict alone" -- virtually the

23

identical language.

24
25

The Ninth

In this Court's Apprendi

JUSTICE SOUTER:

At page 483

Mr. Fisher, you know,

assuming we read it the way you read it, I've got a
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

basic problem that doesn't really surface until you get

2

to the end of the briefs and I wonder if you would

3

comment on it at the beginning of the argument.

4

-- or I'll put it in the form of a question.

5

That is

Is the decision which the judge makes here

6

to sentence consecutively rather than concurrently, a

7

decision that requires the finding of any fact about the

8

commission of the crimes themselves or the circumstances

9

of those crimes or about the defendant's character?

10

Does the judge have to make or does the

11

fact -- some fact finder have to make a finding on any

12

of those subjects -- crimes, circumstances, character of

13

the defendant?

14

MR. FISHER:

Yes, he does, Justice Souter.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MR. FISHER:

What is that fact?

It's precisely the same kind of

17

fact that the judge had to find in Blakely itself.

18

Under the Washington, Revised Code of Washington, the

19

statute, the statute for running sentences consecutively

20

in the fashion that Mr. Burton's were run consecutively,

21

refers the judge back to the very same provision that

22

was at issue in Blakely itself, which is the aggravating

23

factors provision of Washington, which was formerly

24

codified at section 390 and is now codified at section

25

400.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I thought the only fact

2

that had to be found was that, given the classification

3

sentencing scheme Washington had, there would be, in

4

effect, a free crime, no incremental punishment, unless

5

there were consecutive sentencing.

6

that falls within any of those categories of crime,

7

character, or circumstances.

9

MR. FISHER:

That's not a fact

That would be a fact, Justice

Souter, but that is not the way the Washington law

10

works.

11

aggravator.

12

decision in Hughes which is cited at the end of our

13

reply brief the Washington Supreme Court made clear that

14

to invoke that aggravator a court has to find that

15

there was extraordinarily serious culpability or

16

extraordinarily serious harm that accompanies the

17

multiple offenses.

18

It is colloquially known as the free crime
But in the Washington Supreme Court

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So it's a misnomer to say

19

it's a mere free crime criterion?

20

some further fact?

21

MR. FISHER:

It's free crime plus

That's right.

And this Court's

22

decision -- I'm sorry.

The Washington Supreme Court

23

decision in Hughes clearly lays that out.

24

any doubt about the way the consecutive sentences work

25

in Washington, I want to give you one other citation, to

If you have

Official

a new Washington Court of Appeals decision that

2

considers a consecutive sentences imposed exactly the same

3

way that Mr. Burton's was.

4

consecutively based on the clearly too lenient factor.

5

That case is called State versus Washington and it was

6

just reported at 143 P.3d 606, 143 P.3d 606.

7

Washington Court of Appeals in that case, considering a

8

sentence just like Mr. Burton's, says that it does

9

trigger and violate Blakely.

10

That is to say, they are run

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The

So the extra fact then is a

11

lot like the sort of heinous, atrocious and cruel

12

aggravator?

13

I mean, it's comparable to it?
MR. FISHER:

Exactly, it's part of the same

14

list.

15

extra culpability, which is one of the ways this

16

aggravator can be met, is the quintessential type of

17

element that needs to be proven beyond a reasonable

18

doubt .

19

And as this Court said in Apprendi itself, that

JUSTICE BREYER:

When you say extra

20

culpability, do you mean the nature of the crime?

21

Suppose there are three crimes all committed at the same

22

time -- murder, rape, and kidnapping.

23

They're all very serious crimes.

24

sentence them consecutively, you will take into account

25

that there were three.

If you sentence them
6

Alderson Reporting Company

And if you

Official

1

concurrently, it doesn't matter.

2

says, we're not just looking to the fact that murder or

3

rape or kidnapping are serious; we're looking to

4

sentence consecutively if do you more than that.

5

have to look to see that the kidnapping was a special

6

kind of kidnapping.
MR. FISHER:

7

The Washington court

You

That's right, Justice Breyer.

8

In section --

9

the Washington Code and it says that sentences shall run

10

concurrently unless the judge makes an extra finding of

11

exactly the same type the judge is required to find in

12

Blakely.

13

Blakely involved concurrent sentences.

14

is doing is saying all sentences should run concurrently

15

unless there's an extra fact, something about the

16

additional crimes that would otherwise be running

17

concurrently, that simply requires the judge to go above

18

and beyond the ordinary concurrent sentences and punish

19

those crimes separately.

20

the current section is section 589 of

And if you look at Blakely itself, remember

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And so what Washington

But could the nature of the

21

additional crimes themselves satisfy it?

22

words, could the judge say, well, all three -- it might

23

be one thing if one were serious and the other two were

24

trivial, but all of these three are very serious.

25

that's in effect a value judgment, not a finding of

7
Alderson Reporting Company

In other

Now,

Official

1

discrete fact.

2

extraordinary criterion that Washington says there must

3

be in addition to free crime.

4

Could that value judgment satisfy the

MR. FISHER:

No, it couldn't, and the

5

Washington decision that I've cited to you will help you

6

with this, because it makes it clear that to trigger an

7

aggravator to run sentences concurrently, just as under

8

Blakely itself, there has to be something above and

9

beyond the elements of the crime or the crimes

10

themselves.

11

simply be that there were three crimes committed

12

and all three of them are very serious.

13

It has to be something about the crime, the additional

14

crimes, that takes it above and beyond the ordinary

15

commission of that crime.

16

It can't simply be -- I'm sorry.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It can't

But, Mr. Fisher, even if

17

it's true that there are other examples out there that

18

might qualify for that example, it's not true of this

19

case?

20
21
22

MR. FISHER:

I'm not sure I follow, Justice

Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

In this particular case,

23

there was -- it was necessary to make an additional

24

finding of fact, even though there may be cases out

25

there in which you could get consecutive sentences
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

without an additional finding of fact?
MR. FISHER:

You're certainly right that in

3

this case you needed to have an extra finding of fact.

4

There are some situations under the Washington Code and

5

I believe in the majority of other States where it is up

6

to the judge's discretion whether to run sentences

7

concurrently, and he could do it for the reason that

8

Justice Souter described.

9

its respondent's brief is it cites these other State

So what Washington does in

10

decisions, from other States that simply have different

11

sentencing systems than we have in Washington.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure I

13

understand that.

14

that the fact of a prior conviction is something that

15

has to be submitted to a jury under Blakely.

16

you're determining that sentences run consecutively,

17

isn't that just the same as looking at a simultaneous

18

conviction and saying they're going to run

19

consecutively?

20

I mean, we have not held, for example,

MR. FISHER:

Why, if

Under some State systems that

21

might be the case, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

Washington the way that the code works is that judges

23

are directed that for multiple crimes the sentences

24

shall run consecutively.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
9
Alderson Reporting Company

However, in

So you'd have -

Official

1

MR. FISHER:

Unless they make the exact kind

2

of extra finding, and it refers them to the precise same

3

statute that was at issue in Blakely itself.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you're saying

5

that that extra finding can't simply be that this is a

6

conviction for a particular serious crime that's going

7

to go unpunished otherwise?

8

MR. FISHER:

That's right.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So under this system

10

if you had a regime where if you're convicted of murder

11

and you've been convicted of rape before that, you get

12

an enhanced sentence beyond the normal murder sentence,

13

that would not contravene Blakely.

14

convicted at the same time for rape and murder and those

15

two sentences run consecutively, you say that that does

16

violate Blakely.

17

MR. FISHER:

But if you're

If the judge needs to make an

18

extra finding beyond the elements of either of those two

19

crimes to run them consecutively, then it would violate

20

Blakely.

21

THE COURT:

But we've never held that?

22

We've never held that consecutive -- that the treatment

23

of sentences as concurrent or consecutive is covered by

24

Blakely?

25

MR. FISHER:

You haven't had a case in the
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Apprendi-Blakely line of cases dealing with consecutive

2

sentences.

3

from the very State that we're dealing with here that

4

says that if the judge needs to make an extra finding

5

beyond the elements of the crimes of conviction and

6

beyond the facts encompassed in the jury's finding of

7

guilt for those crimes, then those findings need to be

8

proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

9

in this case that line, that rule, is triggered.

10

But what you've done is laid down a rule

That's why

The Ninth Circuit of course didn't talk

11

about any of this.

12

that it simply took Apprendi to be a purely formalistic

13

rule that had nothing to do with the facts according to

14

the jury verdict, but it just had to do with whatever

15

the State happened to label as the statutory maximum.

16

In Apprendi this Court said, not once but three times,

17

that the statutory maximum concept was triggered

18

according to the facts encompassed in the jury verdict.

19

And like the Washington courts, the Ninth Circuit simply

20

ignored that language in this Court's opinion.

21

What it said, as I mentioned, is

Lest there be any doubt about the way that

22

concept mapped onto this case, this Court said in Apprendi

23

itself that the relevant inquiry was not one of form but

24

one of effect:

2

3

4

determined.

5

MR. FISHER:

The judgment

That's right, Justice Ginsburg.

6

And if what the State is saying is correct, which is to

7

say that we don't have any judgment at all until the

8

sentence is final, then all you get from that is that

9

Mr. Burton's first petition should have been dismissed

10

and the court could have gotten it dismissed.

11

submit what you can't do from that is retroactively

12

change the first petition that he explicitly told the

13

court was against the 1994 judgment, and that he told

14

the court in that same filing on JA 35 and JA 40, that

15

his sentence was still on direct review.

16

retroactively change that challenge to the 1994 judgment

17

into one against the 1998 judgment, for two reasons.

18

But we

You can't

One is that if the State is right, the

19

district court wouldn't have had jurisdiction under that

20

1998 -- challenge against the 1998 judgment either,

21

because as Mr. Burton forthrightly told the court, that

22

sentence was still on direct review.

23

get past that, we submit that this Court's Castro

24

decision simply doesn't allow a court, especially

25

retroactively, to recharacterize a habeas petition that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm asking if it is your

position whether or not he properly can do that?
MR. FISHER:

I don't think so.

But I'm just

4

recognizing that that's a jurisdictional question that

5

this Court would decide for itself.

6

he can't do that, what the district court would have had

7

to say is, Mr. Burton, you're not allowed to challenge

8

the 1994 judgment.

9

could have challenged the 1998 judgment.

But assuming that

judge would have said, "Now Mr. Burton, you're only

11

challenging your conviction for the 1994 judgment.

12

need to wait until you're ready to challenge your

13

sentence, and then you can challenge the 1998 judgment."

14

Presumably -- and this is I think a fair inference

15

especially from the petition itself as it is reprinted,

16

since he told the district court that he was challenging

17

his sentence, if he was told he couldn't bring it at

18

that time he would have said okay, I will withdraw it

19

and wait until I can challenge my sentence.

MR. FISHER:

Why not?

Because it is a common rule

4

but the lower courts do all the time; and the Fourth

5

Circuit case in Taylor which I've cited in the reply

6

brief is one of them.

7

for a petitioner to bring one petition against a

8

judgment and then be partially successful, and then

9

bring a new petition against something in the new

10

judgment.

11

And it may -

12

Where, it is a common practice

And that's essentially what happened here.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Aren't those cases in which

13

the first judgment is complete, he simply does not

14

attack everything that was a predicate for the first

15

judgment; and then if there is, in fact, a new trial,

16

and a new judgment, of course, the habeas possibility

17

arises again, whereas in this case, the first judgment

18

was not complete.

3

until the whole thing is over.

4

because exhaustion is not a jurisdictional matter, I'm

5

going to go ahead and decide it.

6
7

MR. FISHER:

But nevertheless,

Could a district judge have

done that?

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

I think what would have needed

10

to have happened here, since Mr. Burton at pages 35 and

11

40 of the joint appendix, told the district judge, I'm

12

still challenging my sentence on direct appeal, under

13

AEDPA and customary comity principles, the judge would

14

have needed to say, you need either to renounce that

15

appeal from the State court or renounce this one.

16

couldn't do both at the same time.

You

17

Mr. Burton, if he had wanted to, I think it

18

is fair to say, could have gone into district court and

19

said, I now have a new judgment and I'm going to

20

challenge my conviction and sentence because I have no

21

intention of challenging my sentence through State court

22

proceedings.

23

that would be a very different situation than what we

24

have here.

25

And perhaps he could have done that.

But

If I can turn back to the, not a new rule
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question, another angle at this is not simply to look at

2

the text of this Court's opinion in Apprendi which we

3

submit told a State court in this situation all it would

4

have needed to know, but also perhaps it is helpful to

5

look behind that and look at the statutes that were in

6

play in New Jersey and in Washington.

7

did that it becomes, we submit, very clear that a

8

district judge, any reasonable trial judge, that is,

9

would have known that Apprendi applied here.

10

And even if you

What you had in New Jersey was essentially

11

two statutes.

21

circumstances -- and here the only difference was, there

22

was a list of circumstances, not just a single one -

23

but if you commit the crime with extra circumstances,

24

then you can get extra punishment.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

was not a new rule but Booker was?

5

MR. FISHER:

So you think Blakely

I think that's fair to say,

6

Mr. Chief Justice.

Because in Blakely all you needed to

7

do was apply Apprendi which said that if you have two

8

different statutory thresholds, the pertinent threshold

9

for Sixth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is

10

the one that cabins the judge's discretion based on the

11

facts in the jury verdict.

12

had to take the term statutory maximum and apply that to

13

a different type of threshold, which was as this Court

To decide Booker this Court

15

So under -- under the system that this Court

16

reviewed in Booker, you had only a single true statutory

maximum.

18

Apprendi principle ought to be in play for the Federal

19

sentencing guidelines.

20

that, a trial judge could have looked at Apprendi itself

21

where this Court and Justice Thomas's concurrence made

22

clear that there was unique status of the Federal

23

sentencing guidelines that made it a more difficult

24

question.

25

And then you had to decide whether the

like that, we had just a simple situation where there

2

were two statutes, one maximum for the ordinary crime,

3

and then an additional maximum for the crime being

4

committed with aggravating circumstances.

5

a very clear map line.

And that's what this Court said

6

in Blakely, of course.

It said, it didn't break any new

7

ground in the decision in Blakely.

8

took the state's argument and rejected it by saying our

9

precedents on this point are clear.

And so it was

It simply said that,

And it just simply

10

quoted the Apprendi language, that the statutory maximum

11

for Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the

12

maximum that a defendant may receive based on the facts

and the jury verdict alone.

decisions?

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

Yes, there were.

And I think,

20

if we want to talk about these, it is important first to

21

be clear about what we are talking about.

22

there was a Supreme Court of Kansas that had looked to

23

the relevant language in Apprendi and decided that its

24

sentencing guidelines system could not stand.

25

you had, on the other side the Supreme Court of
20
Alderson Reporting Company

There were,

And then

Official

1

Washington, and the Supreme Court of Oregon, and a

2

couple of other State intermediate courts, I think some

3

in unpublished decisions, that had gone the other way.

4

But I think it is very telling, Justice

5

Ginsburg, if you want to look at those State supreme -

6

I'm sorry, those State supreme court and lower court

7

decisions, because none of them -- not a single one -

8

quotes Apprendi or even acknowledges the passages in

9

Apprendi that said the test is not one of form but of

10

effect.

And there's several passages in Apprendi that

11

said that the statutory maximum was the maximum allowed

12

based on the facts in the jury verdict.

13

take those into account, we submit, as the Kansas

14

Supreme Court realized, there is only one conclusion

15

that you can reach.

16

were able to come to a contrary decision was simply to

17

pluck out -- pluck out other sentences of Apprendi and

18

not acknowledge the rest of the opinion.

19

the rest of the opinion where this Court has these

20

passages, pages 483, 482, are the absolute guts, the

21

building blocks of the opinion itself.

22

Court canvasses the historical rule that was

23

incorporated into our constitutional system.

24

is not as though that is some sort of dicta that or

25

loose language that this Court had in its opinion.

So once you

The only way those lower courts

Alderson Reporting Company

And of course,

It is where the

And so it

It

1

was the very guts of the holding of Apprendi.

2

And we submit that, in a Teague analysis

3

where you are indeed supposed to look to whether a

4

reasonable jurist would have found something, not just

5

the fact that they exist, but whether a reasonable

6

jurist would have reached a given conclusion, once you

7

take the whole of Apprendi into account, there was only

8

one conclusion that a reasonable jurist could have come

9

to.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose that doesn't

make the dissenters in Blakely feel very good.
MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think,

13

as I understand the dissents in, in Blakely, the

14

dissents in Blakely primarily were saying that Apprendi

15

itself was a bad idea.

16

dictated by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.

17

almost nothing, in fact really nothing in the dissents

18

of Blakely itself that says taking Apprendi as the law,

19

we can distinguish it from the facts in this case.

20

There was nothing of that in the dissents.

21

And that Apprendi really wasn't

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I see

Of course you have to show

22

that the result was dictated by the prior precedent.

23

That's a strong phrase.

24

Stringer versus Black.

25

that's -- that's new.

We said it in Stringer But if it has a new application,
Even though the principle is the
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

same.
MR. FISHER:

I think the Stringer test is

3

helpful because there, of course, this Court said that

4

one of its prior decisions was not a new rule, because

5

even though there was a different State sentencing

6

system that slightly different before the Court in the

7

subsequent case, the principle from the prior case

8

dictated only one result.

9

to the dissents in Blakely and compare them let's say,

10

with the dissents in Booker, on the merits that is, in

11

Booker, I think again it is telling, because the

12

dissenters in Blakely had nothing to say in terms of a

13

possible way to distinguish one case from the other;

14

whereas in Booker, the dissents did point out we don't

15

have to extend it this far.

16

statutes and not go this far.

17

And I think once you go back

We can limit to it to true
So there is a difference.

Really what this case, I think one way to

18

phrase it in terms of what it comes down to, is whether

19

when this Court lays a decision down like Apprendi, that

20

has a clear rule and lots of historical, robust

21

reasoning behind it, saying why we are adopting a

22

certain rule, whether it is up to the lower courts, in

23

this case the State courts, to second-guess this Court

24

and say I don't know if the Court really means what it

25

says, as Justice Breyer later put it in the Blakely
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dissent.

2

We think that, we submit what this Court

3

should say is that when we say something is the law,

4

that lower courts ought to assume that's the law, at

5

least until we tell them somehow that the law is

6

different.

7

If there are no more questions on the new

8

rule, I will quickly address the watershed argument.

9

Because if for some reason this Court adopted the

10

state's view that really all Apprendi was was a highly

11

formalistic rule about what is a statutory maximum, and

12

that -- and that just simply labeling, courts could have

13

evaded it, we think that Blakely itself then has to be

14

considered a watershed exception --

15

And the reason why is because, is because of an error

16

that runs throughout the state's brief.

17

a watershed rule.

And the state's position is basically that

18

this can't be watershed because Apprendi and Blakely

19

deal with circumstances where a defendant has already

20

been convicted of a crime and all we're considering is

21

what sentence ought to be imposed.

22

-- that contravenes the very holding of Apprendi and

23

Blakely which is to remedy the fact that the defendant

24

is being sentenced for a greater crime than the jury

25

actually found him guilty of.

And -

24
Alderson Reporting Company

But, of course, that

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

This argument, this

argument assumes that we rule against you on whether or

3

not it is a new rule.

MR. FISHER:

I think that's right, Mr. Chief

Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Don't you have -

7

don't you have to address AEDPA before we get to that

8

question?

9

MR. FISHER:

10

In the watershed realm?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, it

11

doesn't matter it it's a watershed, I guess it is a

12

point of argument, but it is not clear that it matters

13

whether it is a watershed rule if you read AEDPA

14

2254(d)(1) by its terms.

15

MR. FISHER:

If this Court concluded in the

16

Whorton case that watershed did not survive AEDPA, then

17

of course you're right, watershed doesn't -- can't get

18

us home here.

19

understand it, this Court is considering this case in a

20

posture that it really dealt with in Horn versus Banks

21

where it said that even post AEDPA, what a court is

22

supposed to do is conduct what this Court termed a

23

threshold Teague inquiry as to whether Teague is

24

satisfied.

25

the watershed exception itself.

But as this case comes to the Court, as I

And of course in Horn, this Court mentioned

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. COLLINS

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

11
12

Thank you,

MR. COLLINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

I would like to begin where Justice Ginsburg

14

began, with the issue of successive petitions.

15

believe that the petition before this Court is a

16

successive petition barred under AEDPA.

17

Mr. Fisher says that it's not a successive petition

18

because the first petition challenged the 1994 judgment.

19

But that is simply not correct as a matter of the facts

20

of this case.

21

We

Now my brother,

A new judgment was entered in March of 1998.

22

That judgment was entered as a result of Mr. Burton's

23

conviction being affirmed and his sentence being

24

reversed.

25

first petition, he was in custody pursuant to that

So when he was in custody, when he filed his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

amended judgment.

2
3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that is the only

judgment that could be attacked on habeas?

4

MR. COLLINS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

So he

5

has an amended judgment filed in March of 1998.

He

6

files his first petition challenging his conviction

7

under that petition.

8

petition challenging his sentence.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Later, in 2002, he files a second

It doesn't matter -

10

I'm looking at joint appendix page 34, date of judgment

11

of conviction, he puts in December 16, 1994.

12

MR. COLLINS:

He does put that in, Your

13

Honor, but I don't think that's determinative.

14

take a look at page 35, on question 8, they say, did you

15

appeal from the judgment of conviction?

16

If you did appeal, answer the following.

17

out the facts that he appealed, that his conviction was

18

affirmed, that his sentence was reversed, and then a new

19

judgment is entered in March of 1998.

new judgment was issued in March of '98?
MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, that's in the

joint appendix at page 3, which shows that 27
Alderson Reporting Company

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, I thought you

meant it was in his petition.

3

MR. COLLINS:

No, no, it wasn't in his

4

petition, Your Honor, but it doesn't seem -- the fact

5

that he was looking back at his conviction, original

6

conviction being 1994, and that's what he wrote down,

7

doesn't mean that that was the conviction and that was

8

the judgment under which he was in custody, because it

9

simply wasn't.

The original 1994 judgment no longer

10

existed because a new judgment had been entered.

11

because -- and I don't think -- I think what we disagree

12

about in this is which judgment, if the first petition

13

went to the first -- to the 1994 judgment, and the

14

second petition went to the 1998 judgment, then we would

15

agree with Mr. Fisher that it is not successive.

16

So

On the other hand, I believe I heard him say

17

that if you agree with us, that the only judgment in

18

existence at the time he filed his petition was the 1998

19

judgment.

20

regard to that judgment, one in December of 1998 dealing

21

with the conviction; a second in 2002, dealing with the

22

sentence.

23

Then he's filed a successive petition with

So since it's a successive petition and

24

Mr. Burton did not go through the gatekeeping function

25

that AEDPA requires, there is no -- the district court
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

had no jurisdiction and subsequently, we believe that

2

this Court does not have jurisdiction.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

The fact is, we're looking

4

at page 34, 34 of the joint appendix, and that is the

5

first petition that was filed; is that right?

6

MR. COLLINS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you look at it and it

8

says, filed December 28, and maybe this is what you

9

said.

Then it says date of judgment of conviction,

10

December 16, 1994.

So looking at that, you'd think that

11

is what he was attacking.

12

attacking anything else?

13

MR. COLLINS:

Where does it say he's

Well, Your Honor, it doesn't

14

say he's attacking anything else, but the problem with

15

that is that when he filed this petition, he was not

16

being confined -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but I imagine there

18

are tens of thousands off petitions filed in the Federal

19

system.

20

trying to look at those petitions, or the magistrate

21

looks at them and says what judgment are you attacking,

22

he has to figure that out often for statute of

23

limitations purposes, or some other purpose.

24

over there, go down and read that line two, and he'd

25

think yeah, that's the judgment that's being attacked,

And I would think that judges when they're

He'd look

1

unless of course there's some indication that it's

2

something else.

3

I've never heard of this before.

Is there

4

any precedent on that where even though the petition

5

refers to date A, and there's nothing in to suggest

6

anything other than date A, because it turns out that

7

there's a different judgment that in fact, he's being

8

held, which is date B, that the court says oh, you're

9

attacking date B.

10
11

Is there any precedent that says that's how
it's read?

12
13

MR. COLLINS:

I'm not aware of any

precedent.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

So this might be the

15

first time.

16

the petition that's filed in an ordinary way and say the

17

judgment that's being attacked is the judgment that it

18

refers to.

19

I don't see a reason why you wouldn't read

MR. COLLINS:

Well, Your Honor, I think you

20

have to say the judgment that's being attacked is the

21

judgment by which he's being confined.

22

I don't know what

23

implication this is going to have for a lot of these

24

petitions.

back and say no, it is really date B or something.

3

a little nervous about it.

4

you're the ones in charge.

5

I'm

If you're not nervous,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, Mr. Collins, isn't it

6

your position that, number one, the only judgment that he

7

can attack on habeas is the judgment that is extant at the

8

time of the habeas proceeding, and that is the '92

9

judgment that follows the resentencing?

But he may in

10

attacking that judgment attack the premise of conviction

11

which occurred earlier?

12

MR. COLLINS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And if he chooses to attack

14

only the earlier conviction which is the premise of the

15

later judgment, he has simply in effect waived any other

16

issue.

17

the issue that he could have attacked under the '92

18

judgment, he's in effect trying to split up his habeas,

19

it's second and successive, and that's why he can't do

20

it.

21
22
23

And when he comes in later and tries to raise

MR. COLLINS:

That's exactly right, Your

Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And further, I

24

thought you told me that the petition goes on to

25

indicate that the conviction while affirmed, that the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

words, he details in the petition the subsequent history

6

that would have resulted in a new judgment.

7

MR. COLLINS:

8

Next I would like to go briefly to the

9

That's right, Your Honor.

question that Justice Souter asked about -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just be sure I

11

understand one thing about that?

12

the time he filed the petition on December 28, 1998, he

13

had already had, the second judgment had already been

14

entered by the Washington Supreme Court?

15
16

MR. COLLINS:

It had been entered by the

trial court, Your Honor, so he -

17
18

So you're saying at

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Pursuant to the reversal

of the -

19

MR. COLLINS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

That

20

sentence is on page -- if you look at page 3 of the

21

joint appendix, that is the second amended judgment

22

filed in the superior court in Washington on March 16,

23

1998, and he was confined under the authority of this

24

judgment.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of the second judgment?

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. COLLINS:

Of the second judgment.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why does it make any less

3

sense to allow separate habeas challenges to, first, the

4

conviction, and then the sentence, than it does to allow

5

separate appeals to this Court from each of those?

6

once again under the statute, we entertain appeals only

7

from final judgment, but you can bring here on

8

certiorari the judgment of conviction, even though

9

proceedings for the sentence are still in progress.

10

MR. COLLINS:

And

Well, Your Honor, I think

11

we're talking about the habeas corpus statute and there

12

the Court -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A fortiori, we have a lot

14

more control over habeas corpus, which is an equitable

15

remedy, than we do over, what is it, 1257, our

16

jurisdictional statute under certiorari.

17

Why does it make any more sense for habeas

18

purposes to insist that he await the final sentence

19

before he gets review of the premise for that sentence,

20

namely the conviction?

21

MR. COLLINS:

22

I think that a couple things are being

23

Your Honor, I'm sorry.

confused here.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. COLLINS:

All right.

The first thing is when -- is
33

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this a successive -- is this a successive petition, and

2

we would say it is, because he filed the first one and

3

then the second one.

4

Now the question of whether he can get

5

relief under the first -- under his first habeas

6

petition does not depend on the entry of a final

7

judgment.

8

judgment was entered in March of 1998.

9

1998, he filed his first petition.

In fact, under the facts of this case, the
In December of

And in fact, the

10

first petition was denied in April of 2000 on the

11

merits, because it had been exhausted, he didn't have to

12

wait for that, because those claims were exhausted and

13

because they were ripe, because they -- the factual

14

predicates had occurred in the trial court, then that

15

was all that was required for him to bring those claims.

16

He didn't have to wait for a final judgment.

17
18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you're saying he can't

later bring any claim about the sentence?
MR. COLLINS:

That's because Congress in

20

AEDPA has declared that you have to bring all of your

21

claims in your -- at one time, and if you don't, then

22

your petition should be dismissed as successive, unless

23

you go through the gatekeeping solution.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that if the statute

governing our review had an exhaustion requirement and a
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

second and successive requirement comparable to the

2

AEDPA requirement, the case that Justice Scalia put

3

would be exactly like this case?

4

MR. COLLINS:

I believe so, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. COLLINS:

Okay.

So I just briefly want to go,

7

Justice Souter, to where you started about the

8

consecutive sentence issue.

9

We believe that consecutive sentence is

10

quite different than, from what exists in Blakely and

11

that, in fact, there aren't really additional findings

12

of fact.

13

the circumstances, about the character.

14

this case, the finding of fact entered by the trial

15

court in order to justify the exceptional sentence -

16

this is on page 27 of the joint appendix, finding of

17

fact 18 -- if the court were to sentence the defendant

18

to a standard range sentence on each count run

19

concurrently, he would receive the same punishment as if

20

he had committed only the rape in the first degree.

21

This would effectively result in the free crimes

22

of robbery in the first degree and burglary in the first

23

degree because he would receive no additional penalty

24

for those crimes.

25

I think you referred to about the crime, about
In fact, in

Now -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm sorry.

Is that sufficient, as you understand

2

it, under the Washington case that your brother cited to

3

me?

4

MR. COLLINS:

I believe it is, Your Honor.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.
I thought the law was

7

that the sentence shall be concurrent unless, and the

8

unless is that the judge makes an additional finding,

9

the very same kind of finding that he would make in

10

determining aggravating factor.

11

MR. COLLINS:

Your Honor, the sentence could

12

have been run consecutively because of an aggravating

13

factor.

14

fact, had three independent and separate reasons for

15

running the sentence consecutively.

16

be, I think we would say aggravating factors that the

17

Blakely reasoning would apply to.

18

appeals when it considered this case only looked at the

19

free crimes element to make that decision.

20

In fact, in this case the trial court judge, in

But the court of

Maybe you can give me just

21

a little more help on this.

you referred to says in substance, if by just sentencing

23

can -- could therefore increase the sentence.

But it doesn't say the judge

result that he thought would have been a miscarriage of

justice.

that's right.

pointed out that he would get a pass would have been

sufficient to justify consecutive sentences?

MR. COLLINS:

That's true, Your Honor.

But

20

if you take a look at the court of appeals opinion which

21

is at page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix, when the

22

court of appeals looks at the sentence, what the court

23

of appeals says is, "nonetheless, the sentencing court

24

concluded that the multiple offender policy alone

25

justified the exceptional sentence.
37
Alderson Reporting Company

The fact that the

Official

1

defendant offender score for rape in the first degree is

2

16, thus invoking the multiple offense policy of the

3

Sentencing Reform Act standing alone, is a substantial

4

and compelling reason and justification for imposing the

5

exceptional sentence here."

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

would have been sufficient.

8

MR. COLLINS:

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is to say that that

Exactly.
But in fact that is not

10

what the trial court premised its decision on, because,

11

as Justice Stevens points out, it went on in findings

12

19, 20, and 21 about deliberate cruelty, sophistication

13

and planning, and so on.

14

findings, the court says, from the foregoing facts the

15

court now makes the following conclusions of law.

16

Having been through those

It seems to me as though the trial court was

17

basing its decision on those foregoing facts as well as

18

upon finding 18, which was the free crime finding.

MR. COLLINS:

Well, I think that the -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I guess what I'm saying is

21

the fact that he might have -- I'm assuming for the sake

22

of argument that the trial court might on the basis

23

simply of the free crime conclusion have sentenced

24

consecutively, is simply not the case that we've got,

25

because he sentenced consecutively on that basis and on

cruelty, sophistication, and so on.

2

MR. COLLINS:

Well, Your Honor, I believe

3

that the court of appeals felt that that consecutive

4

sentence on the free crimes was -- standing alone would

5

have been sufficient.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't want to take you

7

up.

Let me just have one on the merits, one.

I mean,

8

the reason I want you to get to the merits, and I put in

9

my dissent.

I was trying as hard as I could to show why

10

I thought this case was wrong.

11

saying that -- what it says, and then I quote the two

12

sentences that any fact, et cetera, any fact that

13

increases beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must

14

be submitted to a jury and prescribed statutory maximum,

15

again quote, means "solely on the basis of the facts

16

reflected in the jury verdict."

17

I start the dissent by

Okay.

Then at the end of the opinion I say:

18

"Until now I would have thought the Court might have

19

limited Apprendi so its underlying principle wouldn't

20

cause so much harm."

21

explain how they might have limited Apprendi, but

22

somehow that disappeared from the opinion because I

23

guess I couldn't think of it.

24
25

Now, the next sentence of course I

So you're going to tell me now -- I mean, I

couldn't think of how they might have limited Apprendi,

2

and they read Apprendi to mean what it said.

3

tell me the phrase I might have put in but couldn't

4

think of that would have limited Apprendi?

5

MR. COLLINS:

Now, you

Well, Your Honor, I think that

6

you could have said that the definition of "statutory

7

maximum" is the traditional statutory maximum that was

8

at issue in Apprendi.

9

decision the Court specifically, I think in response to

And in fact in the Apprendi

10

Justice O'Connor's dissent, explained that Walton versus

11

Arizona was still good law.

12

the jury would find somebody guilty of aggravated first

13

degree murder, but they could not receive the death

14

penalty unless the judge made additional findings in a

15

hearing.

16

And as you know, in Walton

And it seemed to say that the statutory

17

maximum was death and that in fact the judge's findings

18

would not take you above that statutory maximum.

think that -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Wasn't that overturned in

Ring?

22

MR. COLLINS:

It was overturned in Ring,

23

Your Honor.

But when you had lower court appellate

24

judges looking at your decision in Apprendi and seeing

25

the fact that Walton and Apprendi were consistent, it
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was logical for them to conclude, as virtually every

2

single court did except for Kansas, that the definition

3

of "statutory maximum" was the traditional statutory

4

maximum that was in Apprendi.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Was it logical for them to

6

conclude it or were they -- were they expressing the

7

hope that the Court would draw a distinction which it

8

had not drawn in the formulation that it gave in

9

Apprendi?

It's one thing to say that if you draw no

10

further distinctions, Apprendi requires a certain

11

result.

12

draw a distinction and we're going to predict that they

13

will, and hence not apply Apprendi.

14

It's another thing to say but maybe they will

Weren't the other appellate courts to which

15

you refer engaged in the latter exercise, which I call

16

the exercise of hope?

17

MR. COLLINS:

I'm not sure that I would

18

agree with that, Justice Souter, only because as I think

19

Justice O'Connor explained in her dissent, there are two

20

ways to read Apprendi, and one of those ways would

21

result in upholding guideline systems which are now

22

invalid because of Blakely and Booker, but really quite

23

different from Apprendi because those systems involve

24

what you would call guided discretion.

25

Apprendi if you wanted the aggravating factor if the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

That is, in

Official

1

judge found it by a preponderance then the sentence was

2

enhanced.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, but doesn't that

4

require drawing a distinction that Apprendi did not

5

speak to?

6

Mr. Fisher points out that three times we repeated in

7

Apprendi the formula about fact, beyond fact found by a

8

jury on the basis of which, et cetera, the range

9

increases.

And isn't it still the case that, I think

10

Isn't the distinction which -- and I trust

11

your recollection here -- that Justice O'Connor had in

12

mind and that they had in mind a distinction which

13

simply was not addressed in Apprendi and would have been

14

something new as opposed to merely an application of

15

what was implicit in Apprendi?

16

I believe it definitely would

have been something new, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

23
24
25

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

please the Court:

2

If I could begin by addressing the issues

3

that you were just talking about, there was a

4

distinction that the Court could have drawn between

5

Apprendi and Blakely and that reasonable jurists could

6

have drawn and did draw.

7

that you were discussing before with the State, which

8

was supported by Justice O'Connor's proposing that as an

9

interpretation in her dissent and the majority not

One was the formal distinction

10

responding to that, that that distinction was contrary

11

to the rule but implausible, but in fact accepting

12

the -- accepting that it was a plausible distinction and

13

saying that it still wouldn't have made a difference,

14

that the Apprendi rule still was important.

15

The second -- and in addition to that, that

16

distinction that Justice O'Connor drew there was

17

consistent with the Apprendi Court's distinction of

18

Walton.

19

could have interpreted looking at that decision at the

20

time with those distinctions and what the Court said in

21

Apprendi.

22

And you have to look at what reasonable jurists

But in addition to that, there was more than

23

a formal distinction that could have been drawn between

24

the system in Apprendi and the Washington guidelines

25

system.

That's the distinction that we proposed in our
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

amicus brief in Blakely and it rested on the fact that

2

sentencing guideline systems like Washington try to

3

channel but not to eliminate the discretion that

4

sentencing judges have to sentence within the otherwise

5

applicable limits.

6

sentencing judge retained a significant degree of

7

discretion that reasonable jurists could have analogized

8

to traditional sentencing systems that aren't

9

constrained by Apprendi.

10

And in the Washington system the

The facts, the facts on which the judge

11

could rely to go above the guidelines, were not

12

specified as in Apprendi and as in Ring by the

13

legislature, but it was a wide open set that enabled the

14

judge himself or herself to determine what facts the

15

judge thought could justify a higher sentence; and in

16

addition, the facts alone didn't trigger the higher

17

sentence.

18

the additional determination that those facts rose to

19

the level of substantial and compelling reasons that

20

justified the higher sentence.

21

The judge had to look at those facts and make

In that respect, the judge had a degree of

22

sentencing discretion to decide what facts justified it

23

and whether it was in fact justified.

24
25

Now, of course, this Court rejected those
distinctions in Blakely.

But the question is whether a
44

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

reasonable jurist could have accepted those distinctions

2

and drawn a difference, and we submit that they could

3

have.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Roberts, do you

5

have a position on whether we have a successive petition

6

problem here?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

We don't have a position on

8

that precise, on that particular issue here, because it

9

can't arise for Federal prisoners.

But let me explain

10

why it can't arise for Federal prisoners because perhaps

11

that will give the Court some guidance in resolving the

12

issue.

13

that the conviction and the sentence are part of a

14

unitary judgment and that that unitary judgment doesn't

15

become final until the conviction and the sentence have

16

both been fully adjudicated.

17

In the Federal system, it's well established

That understanding is reflected in the

18

language of 28 U.S.C. 2255, which is the statute that

19

authorizes collateral attacks by Federal prisoners.

20

That statute authorizes attacks -- what it authorizes is

21

motions to vacate, set aside, or correct a sentence.

22

it's clear from that that it's not authorizing

23

collateral attacks on a conviction independent of the

24

attendant sentence.

25

guidance here, because 2255 was intended to be a

And I think that could shed some

45
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

parallel and substitute remedy to traditional habeas for

2

Federal prisoners.

3

I would also make a point on the other sort

4

of preliminary issues that were being discussed on the

5

consecutive sentence issue, that it's not only the fact

6

that the judge said that the multiple offense policy

7

standing alone could justify the consecutive sentence

8

here and that the court of appeals relied on that in

9

upholding that.

10

But the court of appeals went further,

11

because petitioner had made a separate challenge to -

12

and this is on page 52 and 53 of the joint appendix.

13

Petitioner made a separate challenge to the other two

14

aggravating factors.

15

district court wasn't allowed to rely on -- excuse me,

16

the trial court couldn't rely on those two other

17

aggravating factors because he had not relied on them in

18

the original sentencing and this was a resentencing.

19

Petitioner argued that the

The court of appeals rejected that challenge

20

and it rejected that challenge because it said the

21

sentencing court concluded that the multiple offense

22

policy alone justified the exceptional sentence, and

23

then on page 53 it said:

24

25

MR. ROBERTS:

The trial court said each of

the three standing alone was sufficient.

12

13

to deal with this challenge to these other two

14

factors because they're out of the case.

15

that this Court has to take the case as coming from -

16

coming from the Washington courts as if what the courts

17

essentially said is those other two are not in the case

18

any more.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So we can treat it in

to interpret what the trial court did as relying only on

7

What they chose to do is, we're going

And that was the basis for responding to that

If I could turn to the issue of Blakely

8

retroactivity for a few minutes.

In addition to the

9

points that I made before about why Blakely was a new

10

rule, I would also submit that Blakely is not a

11

watershed rule because it's not a bedrock rule that's

12

essential to a fair trial, and rules are only bedrock if

13

they approach the fundamental and sweeping importance of

14

Gideon, and Blakely doesn't have that kind of importance

15

for three reasons.

16

pervasively affects every aspect of the trial, but

17

Blakely affects only the procedure for determining the

18

punishment of defendants who have already been found

19

guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of all the elements of a

20

crime.

21

First, the right to counsel

Second, a felony trial in which the

22

defendant is denied counsel is inherently unfair, but

23

it's not inherently unfair to use the preponderance

24

standard to find facts that determine the extent of

25

punishment, and in fact the Constitution permits the use
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of a preponderance standard to find many facts that have

2

as much or more impact on punishment as facts covered by

3

Blakely.

4

minimums, facts on which a judge relies to sentence

5

within a broad statutory range, and even facts on which

6

a judge relies to sentence above the standard range in

7

advisory guideline systems.

8
9

Those include facts that trigger mandatory

Third, counsel is so essential to a fair
trial that deprivation of the right can never be

10

discounted as harmless error.

11

Recuenco that Blakely errors can be harmless, and in

12

reaching that holding the Court expressly concluded that

13

Blakely errors do not necessarily render a criminal

14

trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for

15

determining guilt or innocence.

16

But this Court held in

That conclusion seems to strongly suggest

17

that Blakely is not a bedrock rule essential to a fair

18

trial.

19

If the Court has no further questions -

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

23
24
25

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Let me say one word on

jurisdiction and then turn to two comments on the
49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

merits.

2

that this rarely happens in the Federal system.

3

rarely happens in the State system.

4

other case where a petitioner has gone in naming, as the

5

State would say, in effect the wrong judgment and

6

saying:

7

On jurisdiction, I think Mr. Roberts is right
It

We can't find any

"I'm challenging this judgment."
But what happened here was just that.

8

Mr. Burton went in and said he was challenging the 1994

9

judgment.

And under this Court's Castro decision, when

10

a pro se petitioner comes in and says I'm doing one

11

thing, in that case making a motion for a new trial, it

12

can't be converted into something else which is a first

13

habeas petition without advising the petitioner.

14

here, not only was he not advised by the trial court but

15

the State in its own answer, which we attached to our

16

reply brief, agreed that he could challenge the 1994

17

conviction, and said that conviction is final, and he

18

can challenge that judgment, the 1994 judgment.

19

So it's way too late in the day for the

20

State to stand up to you now and say this pro se

21

petitioner should bear the burden of bringing an

22

improper petition.

23

And

On the merits, I don't want to elaborate

24

beyond simply just telling this Court that if you look

25

at the Hughes decision and you look at the Washington
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision from the Washington state courts, it is clear

2

that an extra finding was necessary here, even if the

3

only aggravator in play is the free crimes are clearly

4

too lenient factor.

5

a judge needs to find, and I'm quoting, "extraordinarily

6

serious harm or culpability arising from the multiple

7

offenses."

8

before you now and quotes from parts of Mr. Burton's

9

case where the trial judge did not explicitly make that

Hughes makes it crystal clear that

And to the extent that the State stands

10

finding, that only reinforces the strength of his habeas

11

petition now, that under Washington state law, the judge

12

needed to make that kind of an extra finding and the

13

judge didn't do so.

14

Let me finally turn to a discussion about

15

whether this Court's treatment of Walton and Apprendi

16

could have given a State judge a reasonable basis to

17

distinguish the system at issue in Blakely.

18

think it could because this Court didn't simply say in

19

Apprendi that Walton stands.

20

reason why the Arizona capital system as we understand

21

it is okay is because it's nothing more than a system

22

that is permissible under Williams against New York.

23

We don't

It explicitly said the

It's one where on the basis of the jury's

24

finding of guilt that the death penalty is permissible

25

without anything else.

And so the only disagreement
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between the majority and Justice O'Connor's dissent was

2

as to the way Arizona's system worked, but any judge that

3

would have looked at Apprendi would have seen, the

4

majority is telling us that a system is okay so long as

5

the jury verdict itself allows the ultimate sentence.

6

That is exactly the kind of system that was

7

not in place in Washington, so a judge should have full

8

well realized.

9

And of course as Justice Ginsburg pointed

10

out, once it became clear to this Court the way that

11

Arizona's capital sentencing system functioned, this

12

Court had little difficulty simply applying the Apprendi rule

13

and agreeing that that system had to be invalid too.

14

And just like the Blakely decision itself, not even the

15

dissenters suggested that Apprendi dictated otherwise.

16
17

If this Court has no further questions, I'll
submit the case.
