ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY W. WIERCIOCH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WIERCIOCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

The Fifth Circuit found that Scott Panetti

11

suffers from paranoid delusions that cause him to

12

believe that he is being executed because of a

13

conspiracy against him and not as punishment for his

14

crimes.

15

that Scott Panetti is competent to be executed because

16

an inmate need not have a rational understanding of the

17

reason for his execution but only be aware of it.

18

standard is a profound misreading of Ford versus

19

Wainwright but before I address the merits of that

20

issue, I would like to discuss two preliminary matters

21

first.

22

Despite that finding, the Fifth Circuit held

This

First, Scott Panetti's petition containing

23

his execution competency claim is not second or

24

successive under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death

25

Penalty Act.

And second, the State court adjudication
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of that claim resulted in a decision that was an

2

unreasonable application of clearly established Federal

3

law as determined by this Court.

4
5

The first issue:

This is not a second or

successive petition.

6

Martinez-Villareal recognized that a

7

numerically second petition is not successive, it's not

8

a mere mathematical computation, it's a term of art.

9

And if you bring the claim the first time it's

10

justiciable, it's not second or successive.

11

--

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

Texas law

I didn't understand

13

that to be what the case said.

14

held that it wasn't successive there because the claim

15

had, in fact, been brought in the first petition, and

16

that first petition was dismissed as premature.

17

argument was made that this is just a continuation of

18

that first petition.

19

I thought that the case

And the

Now, the difference here is that the claim

20

was not brought in the first petition, even though it

21

was pretty clear after that case of ours that you had a

22

sure route to raising the claim if you raised it

23

prematurely, and then brought the petition later.

24
25

MR. WIERCIOCH:

Your Honor, I think the

difference is, or the central holding, I believe, of
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Martinez-Villareal is that we do not bring these Ford

2

claims until they are justiciable, until they're ripe.

3

It's the unique nature of Ford claims.

4

uniquely time specific.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They are

If you bring it earlier,

6

it will be unripe.

7

precise procedural posture that we're in now.

8

resolve that.

9
10

But it did, I think, leave open the

MR. WIERCIOCH:

It didn't

Martinez-Villareal did not

resolve that question, Your Honor, that's correct.

11

The other problem with the case, I think, is

12

as you suggest, Justice Scalia, that there is a real

13

danger that these claims could be adjudicated

14

prematurely.

15

Circuit, a case that both the State and we have cited in

16

our briefs, Valdez versus Cockrell.

17

Martinez-Villareal case.

18

And that has happened in the Fifth

And that was a post

The other thing to keep in mind is that

19

Texas law believes that these claims are premature as

20

well.

21

it was also unexhausted and unexhaustible under Texas

22

law.

23

recognize together is that these claims are most

24

efficiently litigated at the end of the process, because

25

of the unique nature of these claims.

So it was premature under Martinez-Villareal, but

And I think what Martinez-Villareal and Texas

5

1

The constitutional violation here is forward

2

looking, unlike most constitutional habeas claims that

3

are backward looking.

4

the date or making it imminent that triggers the

5

violation, that it is now going to carry out the

6

execution of someone who is potentially mentally

7

incompetent.

8
9

And it's the State's setting of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The difference is that in

Martinez-Villareal, it was plausible to say that this

10

was not a second petition.

Now you may be quite right,

11

that there is good reason to say you shouldn't bring

12

something that isn't ripe.

13

were able to get around the language of the statute

14

which says a second or successive petition is not

15

permissible.

But in that earlier case, we

16

Here, how do you get around the language

17

other than to say it shouldn't be that way, that you

18

should be able to bring a second or successive petition

19

when you're raising an issue that was not ripe at the

20

time of the first petition?

21

I mean, as a policy matter, that's a very

22

good argument.

But what do you do with the language in

23

the statute?

24

say -- to place limits upon our ability to review State

25

court judgments.

And after all, Congress is entitled to

My answer would be that the

4

twice.

5

raised in a second when it was ripe.

6

our Ford claim one time.

7

ripe, when the execution date was set.

8

that's the difference there.

That claim actually was raised

It was raised in the first petition, and it was

9

We've only brought

We brought it when it was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I think

It doesn't say a second run

10

at the same claim.

11

you bring new petitions in your second claim that

12

weren't raised in your first, it's still a second or

13

successive petition, and I find it hard to get over that

14

language.

15

It says a second petition.

MR. WIERCIOCH:

Even if

The only thing I can say is

16

that the claim in a sense doesn't even exist until the

17

State is announcing its intention to carry out the

18

execution in the near future by setting the date.

19

if we adopt the rule that the State wants, it's going to

20

have, as in Martinez-Villareal, perverse and seemingly

21

far-reaching consequences for habeas practice.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Is it material to your

23

position to show that there was deterioration in his

24

mental condition between the time of the sentence and

25

the time you brought the petition?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

I.e., the -- during

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

his incarceration, his condition worsened?

2

MR. WIERCIOCH:

I think that is definitely

3

part of it, Your Honor, but it also is the fact that we

4

cannot predict with any reliability how severe mental

5

illnesses are going to influence somebody's mental

6

processes.

7

fluctuate in intensity and severity, often influenced by

8

life events, can have an impact on the inmate's ability

9

to understand the reason for his execution.

10

And the nature of delusions themselves that

In this case it is, his delusion is wrapped

11

up, it's central to it, as the reason he's being

12

executed.

13

ability to predict that is -- we can't do it until that

14

event actually occurs, the event that's going to

15

influence him, and that's the setting of the date.

16

And the intensity of his delusions or our

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why can't you have

17

sought leave to file a second or successive application

18

and met the requirements, if you're right that the

19

factual predicate for the Ford claim doesn't arise until

20

the execution is imminent?

21

Couldn't you have fit your claim under

22

2244(b)(2)(B), I guess, on that basis?

23

don't have to engage in the fiction that a second

24

petition is actually not a second petition.

25

MR. WIERCIOCH:

And then we

I don't think we could have
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fit under that provision, Your Honor, because that

2

provision requires that the evidence, established by

3

clear and convincing evidence but for constitutional

4

error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the

5

applicant guilty of the underlying offense.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose it doesn't

7

fit comfortably under there, but I guess the argument

8

would be that -- guilty of -- we've used the concept of

9

being guilty of the death sentence as opposed to guilty

10

of the crime before, and the fact finder -- you wouldn't

11

be sentenced to death if the sentencer had known you

12

were incompetent.

13

comfortable fit, but at least the part -- it seems to be

14

addressed to the question of a factual predicate that's

15

not present at the time of the first habeas petition.

16

And that seems to be your justification for not filing

17

it at that time.

18

I appreciate that it's not the most

MR. WIERCIOCH:

That's part of the

19

justification, but it's actually I think more than that,

20

that the claim isn't justiciable, that the claim doesn't

21

exist.

22

petitioner to raise, who's attacking a sentence of a

23

number of years, to raise in that petition deprivation

24

of good time credits, that there would be no claim at

25

that point for them to raise it.

I think it would be as if trying to force a

So it's the

9

justiciability, I think, is -

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

The point is

3

that (b)(2)(B) is addressed to that precise situation

4

where the facts aren't present when you file the first

5

application.

6

MR. WIERCIOCH:

The facts aren't present,

7

but the constitutional violation has already occurred,

8

and I think that's got to be the difference.

It's prospective, as

you said?

14

MR. WIERCIOCH:

is that "petition" hear means petition that could have

been brought.

This couldn't have because up to this

MR. WIERCIOCH:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, it is.
Then if you get beyond the

23

second or successive question, your next point was

whether or not AEDPA applies?

That's correct, Your Honor.

In the course of your

argument, could you answer this:

Suppose we find that

the State did not comply with the mandate of Ford

because it didn't give adequate procedures to the

5

defendant, it did not give him an adequate opportunity

to present his defense.

Suppose we find that.

10

entitled and required to hold a new hearing on the

latter, Your Honor.

I would think it's the

The State would argue -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The only thing we

It may be much harder for

you to get that standard on this Court's review of a

7

collateral proceeding than this Court's review of a

9

MR. WIERCIOCH:

But our contention is that

10

the AEDPA does not prevent this Court from addressing

11

the merits of the constitutional issue here.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

MR. WIERCIOCH:

Because?
Because the State court did

14

not abide by the minimum due process procedures set out

15

by Justice Powell's opinion in Ford versus Wainwright,

16

and that is the clearly established law even though it

17

is a concurring opinion.

statement you made in response to a question; you said

Alderson Reporting Company

it's not successive and it isn't a second petition if

2

the first one could not have been brought.

3

4

Right?

But we've just decided this term that that's

5

not the rule.

6

though a first, an earlier petition was unripe, the

7

second petition was still a second petition.

8

can't be the principle that you're espousing, unless you

9

want us to overrule Burton the same term.

In Burden, we -- we -- we said that even

So that

12

13

the same judgment.

14

that we are telling the State that they cannot carry out

15

16

circumstances.

18

Burton is distinguishable; Burton

The nature of the Ford claim is not

We are just saying they

Mr. Burton, on the other hand, could have

19

raised all of his claims at the same time, but he -- he

20

went ahead and raised his conviction -- claims related

21

to his conviction before he raised his claims related to

22

his sentencing.

23

If we had done that, if we had waited until

24

the Ford claim was ripe, all of our usual type habeas

25

claims would have been lost under the statute of
13

Official - Subject to Final Review

limitations.

2

Burton.

That would not have been the case in

3

To get back to your question,

4

Justice Kennedy, the problem here -- let me just say,

5

the essential language of Justice Powell's decision on

6

the minimum due process requirements is that, number

7

one, an impartial decision-maker is required; and

8

secondly, that decision-maker has to have the ability to

9

hear argument and receive evidence from prisoner's

10

counsel, including expert psychiatric evidence that may

11

differ from the State's own psychiatric examinations.

12

That boils down to exactly what we didn't

13

have here.

Now the key point is when the State's or the

14

court's appointed experts went to evaluate Mr. Panetti,

15

new issues were raised; and those are the issues, they

16

were determinative issues, that we didn't have an

17

opportunity to respond to.

18

went to see Mr. Panetti, they characterized his behavior

19

as filibustering about the Bible, answering questions

20

with Biblical verses, refusing to answer questions until

21

they told him whether or not they were Christians.

22

took all of those behaviors to mean that Mr. Panetti was

23

controlling, manipulating and deliberately refusing to

24

answer questions, leading them to the conclusion that

25

Mr. Panetti was competent and he was just malingering.

What happened is when they

were not able to respond to.

4

5

address the issues, to make this proceeding fair.

6

these -- these procedures that we asked for included

7

cross-examination at a hearing and also funds to hire

8

our own defense expert.

9

We asked in a number of

And

It's important to point out that our pro

10

bono attorney who -- I'm sorry, our pro bono expert who

11

did an emergency evaluation two days before the

12

execution, was not a constitutionally adequate

13

procedure.

14

court-appointed attorneys -- I'm sorry, experts, had not

15

yet been appointed, and they had not yet done their

16

evaluation.

17

The reason is clear.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The State

These -- these were not

18

appointed by the prosecutor; they were appointed by the

19

court?

20

MR. WIERCIOCH:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. WIERCIOCH:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Am I right?
Yes.
And you say that's

24

inadequate.

We have to have a full adversarial trial of

25

psychiatric experts in every case where a prisoner
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

claims that he's not mentally competent to be executed.

2

MR. WIERCIOCH:

I respectfully disagree,

3

Your Honor.

We do not have to have that.

What we do

4

have to have in a situation like ours where there is a

5

new issue that is brought up by the charges of,

6

basically malingering, that we have got to have an

7

opportunity to respond to those charges, and engage that

8

issue; and we were not able to engage that issue; and we

9

asked for intermediate steps.

10

The other thing to keep in mind, Your Honor,

11

is that the Texas procedure itself allows for a hearing.

12

That's how they comport with Ford.

13

the Court to overrule Texas's procedures.

14

here is a maverick judge decided not to follow the

15

statute.

16

So we're not asking
What happened

And so it was specifically to our case.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't seem to me, and

17

there's nothing in our history that requires, that you

18

need a full dress trial to decide this issue.

19

seems to me perfectly reasonable for the trial court to

20

appoint experts, not selected by the prosecutor but

21

selected by the judge, and have them conduct the -- the

22

examination of the individual.

23

And it

I, I certainly don't want to -- you know -

process that requires it.

2

MR. WIERCIOCH:

And we're not asking for

3

that, Your Honor.

4

intermediate to that.

5

could have been resolved by having the opportunity to

6

have our own expert especially in a situation where new

7

issues are raised.

8
9

We're asking for something
It could have, like I said, it

I would contrast that with a situation where
our pro bono expert had sent out a report; we overcame

10

the threshold showing that was necessary; two mental

11

health experts are appointed under the statute, and

12

those experts addressed our experts' report and didn't

13

raise any new issues, didn't bring anything new into the

14

mix, but what was brought into the mix here is the

15

malingering charge.

16

And I should add -

18

your own expert, though?

19

own, right?

You -- you -- you did have

anymore after that initial threshold showing that we

18

Your Honor, yes.

19

That's right.

We had a full

So we did more than just submit affidavits
But that did vindicate our position,

I'd like to turn now to the merits.

The

20

test for competency that we have proposed is derived

21

directly from Justice Powell's test that he set out in

22

his concurrence in Ford versus Wainwright.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This very important matter

24

is going to be decided on the basis of the opinion of

25

one, one justice, what, 30 years ago?
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. WIERCIOCH:

Your Honor -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You have no other appeal to

3

a long tradition of how we determine this matter, but

4

just one opinion by one justice because he was the

5

lowest common denominator on the Court at that time.

6

That seems to me very peculiar.

7

MR. WIERCIOCH:

That's not what Justice

8

Powell did.

I mean, what happened in Ford is that the

9

Court did look at all of the common law rationales for

10

the ban, the common law ban on executing the

11

incompetent.

12

Justice Powell's opinion, and they -- the Court -- a

13

MR. WIERCIOCH:

No, Your Honor, it doesn't.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ

25

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. CRUZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

For centuries courts have struggled with how

4

to reconcile mental illness with criminal justice.

In

5

this case, however, the court should not reach the

6

merits of that issue because the AEDPA presents two

7

independent jurisdictional bars to reaching the merits.

8

First, Section 2254 bars relief because the State court

9

proceedings complied with clearly established law under

10

Ford; and second, the plain text of Section 2244 bars

11

relief because Panetti's claim was a second or

12

successive habeas application.

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How should he have

raised the claim to avoid the second or successive bar?

2

When he was able to raise the claim that bore enough of

seems to me that to say, well, he's simply reopening

5

something that he reopened before is just playing with

6

words.

7

MR. CRUZ:

It

Justice Souter, I don't disagree

8

with you that as a policy matter it's not the most

9

satisfactory outcome.

The difficulty -- and it's the

10

difficulty this Court wrestled with in

11

Martinez-Villareal -- is the plain text of the statute

12

suggests a clear outcome, an outcome that is not

13

necessarily the most practical or efficient.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but you can deal with

15

the text of this.

I mean, given the fact that there's

16

no neat satisfactory solution to this no matter where we

17

turn, the -- at least the text of the statute can be

18

read to say that second successive petition at least

19

means a petition when it raises -- refers to a petition

20

in which a claim could previously have been brought.

21

And if we say, look, unripe claims can't be brought at

22

an earlier time, then it's not a second and successive

23

petition in that sense.

24

admittedly, it's interpretive, but it's one way to deal

25

with the text.

That's one way to you know -

It's kind of a -- it seems to me more

forthright than saying, well, he's just continuing or

2

reviving the claim that he raised the first time around.

3
4

MR. CRUZ:

In our judgment that reading is

not consistent with the plain text of the statute.

5

The only two bases that Petitioner could

6

legitimately advance for disregarding the plain text are

7

that doing so would be absurd following the plain text

8

or unconstitutional.

9

neither.

10

He has attempted to advance

He's simply arguing it would be more

efficient.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

More than that, the section

12

goes on to make an exception from the bar of second or

13

successive.

14

which he could not have raised it earlier, namely he can

15

get out of the bar if he shows that the claim relies on

16

a new rule of constitutional law, which he couldn't have

17

raised before, or the factual predicate didn't exist

18

before, which he couldn't have raised before.

19

The exception itself is a situation in

All of those exceptions would be unnecessary

20

if we interpret the provision itself to contain within

21

it an exception for anything that couldn't have been

22

raised before.

25

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Scalia, I think that's

exactly correct.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then what do you say to the

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

indication from those two exceptions that Congress

2

simply wasn't adverting to this problem?

3

MR. CRUZ:

Congress may not have been -- I

4

don't doubt that there is a real possibility Congress in

5

drafting this statute was not specifically considering

6

Ford claims.

8

petitioner has that petition must include in his first

9

petition.

10
11

But what Congress was doing was writing

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Has.

Has.

He doesn't have

the claim at that first point.

12

MR. CRUZ:

Well, but given the exceptions,

also every claim he intends to raise at any point in the

14

proceeding.

15

He had been arguing about competency from day one and he

16

had not only Martinez-Villareal which gave him a direct

17

path to preserve this, but he had Fifth Circuit

18

precedent that required him to raise this and he

19

disregarded the Fifth Circuit -

20

In this case, Panetti was on full notice.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You in effect are telling

us that we've got to read this to mean that any claim

22

that he could conceivably have under any set

23

of conceivable circumstances has got to be raised on the

So your opinion is -- and

there is, take Powell.

And it seems to say, the Fifth Circuit

18

explicitly, it doesn't matter if the next thing the

19

prisoner says and the reason that's going to happen is

20

because of the wild dogs.

21

The wild dogs are manipulating the minds of all of the

of the wild dogs forever.

to Powell and Marshall, that sounds like a substantive

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Breyer, the argument that

10

you suggest, Panetti has at no point made an argument

11

that substantively the State court decision violated

12

clearly established law.

13

Because there is no clearly established law on what the

14

standard is for competency.

15

justice writing alone, because Justice Powell was not

16

joined by anyone, and his opinion was not controlling on

17

the standard for incompetency.

18

And there's a reason for that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In Ford, there was one

It was solely But I did understand

19

counsel's argument to say that relief must be given, he

20

cannot be executed, if he lacks the capacity to form a

21

rational understanding of the nature and justification

22

for the punishment.

23

we can just use the lay term, you cannot execute an

24

insane person if he is grossly psychotic, and you can't

25

execute a comatose person?

Justice Kennedy, we agree with

That was a holding of Ford.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So we're talking about

what insane means, and that's a lay term.

there's a gross psychosis which is a severe

That test is very close to the

understanding, which is deliberately borrowed from the

Fifth and Sixth Amendment jurisprudence concerning

competency to waive counsel and to stand trial, and we

circumstance.

What Panetti is endeavoring to

JUSTICE BREYER:

But suppose you went back.

20

You see, you say it's just Justice Powell.

it has been, for centuries, is abhorrent to exact in

him from comprehending the reasons for the penalty or

MR. CRUZ:

back to the suggestion that there be, in effect, a

MR. CRUZ:

goes to the underlying guilt of the offense.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

that it's functioning not that different from an

Turning to the merits or returning to the
merits, there was a square factual finding that Panetti

these murders, and an additional factual finding that he

has the capacity to understand the reason for that.
