CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Frederick.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court.

11

In 1988, the Government of British Columbia

12

created Powerex to perform a variety of public functions

13

including the marketing of surplus hydropower generated

14

by development of the Province's natural resources

15

pursuant to bilateral agreements with the United States.

16

The Ninth Circuit, however, denied Powerex

17

its rightful status as an organ of a foreign State

18

entitled to remove this case from State court to Federal

19

court.

20

Before addressing the appellate jurisdiction

21

issue, I'd like to highlight briefly the two key errors

22

by the Ninth Circuit in rejecting Powerex's organ

23

status.

24

determining an entity's status as an organ of a foreign

25

State.

First, the court articulated the wrong test for

The factors the Ninth Circuit found dispositive
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are inconsistent with the FSIA; and second, the court

2

overlooked crucial evidence of Powerex's public

3

functions that are the best indication of its sovereign

4

status.

5

distributes the proceeds from Powerex's operations,

6

supervises Powerex through BC Hydro, subjects Powerex to

7

provincial laws not applicable to private companies and

8

grants Powerex special benefits including exemption from

9

taxation.

The British Columbia Government receives and

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Frederick, are you

going to get to the 1447(d) problem?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Let me address that

13

now.

The court's -- the district court's remand order

14

was appealable because it was not issued under 1447(c).

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The district court

16

thought it was and one we did, the district court said I

17

have no authority in -- under -- over any of these

18

people.

19

So back it goes.
MR. FREDERICK:

The district court made two

20

mutually exclusive statements, that remand was proper

21

and that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.

22

of that inconsistency, the court of appeals -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Removal.

Because

Removal was

are these statements?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You said remand was proper.

That's the -

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Sorry.

That removal was

4

proper under the sovereign removal provisions of 1441(d)

5

and 1442(a).

6

jurisdiction.

7

It also then said it lacked subject matter

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But at the point it was

8

acting it was remanding, and its basis for remanding was

9

not that it thought the removal had been proper; the

10

basis for its remanding was that it said it lacked

11

jurisdiction over three of the other cross defendants.

12
13

MR. FREDERICK:

But immunity was the basis

of the district court's thinking that it had to remand.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It may have been, leaving

15

aside the question of whether it was right or wrong, it

16

may have been wrong.

17

it seems to me is fairly clearly remanding for a

18

jurisdictional reason.

19

But what it thought it was doing

MR. FREDERICK:

And what this Court's cases

20

say, Justice Souter, is that the remand has to be a

21

ground cognizable under 1447(c).

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Those cases are all

23

-- all based on Thermtron.

You don't have any doubt

24

that Thermtron would come out the other way today, do

25

you?

MR. FREDERICK:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

I certainly do -- in light of, in

light of the statutory language as it exists now?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

5

Thermtron rule has been reaffirmed no less than four

6

times by this Court, notwithstanding two statutory

7

amendments.

8

the basis of statute is the strongest form of stare

9

decisis.

It has been reaffirmed and stare decisis on

So I do -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But stare decisis on

11

the basis of statute is kind of a weak basis when the

12

statute's been changed.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

14

Thermtron rule was reaffirmed earlier this term in the

15

Osborn case, has been reaffirmed in prior cases lead -

16

from the time it was decided even through statutory

17

amendments.

18

to change that rule, it could have done so clearly.

19

we note that the Respondents here don't ask for

20

Thermtron to be overruled, and it is clear from the

21

amicus on their side, that the only way you could rule

22

in favor of the Respondents in this case would be to

23

overrule Thermtron.

24
25

Our submission is that if Congress intended

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
far cry from this case.

And

But Thermtron was such a

In Thermtron the district judge

said yes, I have jurisdiction but I'm just too busy, so

2

I'm going to toss this case back to the State court.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

But here, Justice Ginsburg,

4

the court did have jurisdiction because removal was

5

properly effectuated once the entities that we moved

6

were identified correctly as sovereigns, either foreign

7

sovereigns in the case of BC Hydro, or Federal

8

sovereigns in the case of BPA.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we go into that

10

question all the time, 1447(b) is a nullity.

11

in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether

12

indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to

13

be able to appeal every case.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

I mean, if

No, you're not,

whether removal is proper by those sovereigns.

Immunity is not a

It is a separate freestanding

It is a status determination that determines

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That would be fine if

21

1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the

22

basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it

23

says.

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

But if in Thermtron the

busy, I therefore lack subject matter jurisdiction and

2

remand under 1447(c), I don't think there's any doubt

3

that the courts would look beyond the label given.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't think the court

5

said in Thermtron, so therefore, I have no subject

6

matter jurisdiction.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

I'm speaking hypothetically,

8

Justice Ginsburg.

9

district court attached here was the wrong label, and

10
11

My point is that the label the

that's why the court of appeals to satisfy JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why?

Why was it wrong

12

when with respect to the sovereign parties, the district

13

court said I have -- these people are totally immune

14

from suit; therefore, I have no jurisdiction over them.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Because it is inconsistent

16

with the notion that remand orders have no preclusive

17

effect to remand a case on the ground that the

18

sovereigns are immune, and force them to relitigate

19

their immune status in State court.

20

why Congress enacted these sovereign removal provisions.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is precisely

Then what you are really

22

arguing for is, in effect, a separate rule, and that is

23

that 1447(d) has an exception when we are dealing with

24

foreign sovereign immunities.

25

MR. FREDERICK:

That's our backup
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

submission, Justice Souter.

2

that if you agree with our principal submission and -

3

You do not need to reach

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the trouble with the

4

principal submission, it seems to me, is that we have

5

said that even if the district court has come to an

6

erroneous conclusion about jurisdiction, if it

7

understands that it is making a jurisdictional ruling,

8

that is not appealable.

9

MR. FREDERICK:

But Justice Souter, it did

10

so.

11

so have always been grounds -- jurisdictional grounds

12

cognizable under 1447(c).

13

such a ground, because the purpose of having the removal

14

provision on the basis of status is to allow the Federal

15

courts to decide the immunity status.

16

sends the case back to State court on immunity grounds,

17

it does not have preclusive effect in the State courts.

18

The State courts will be obliged to relitigate sovereign

19

immunity status and there will be no recourse except

20

through appeal through the State court -

22

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FREDERICK:

No, Justice Scalia, that's

2

not our backup argument.

Our point is that in this

3

case, the district court had jurisdiction by virtue of

4

the successful removals, which everybody conceded were

5

correct, that the label that it attached, immunity is

6

subject matter jurisdiction, is not a label for a ground

recognized in 1447(c).

determine whether or not the remand was a mandatory

So it was appropriate for the

10

remand under 1447(c) or a discretionary one of the type

11

this Court has recognized in the Cohill case.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did you request -- when

13

the question of Powerex -- authority over Powerex was

14

before the district court, did you request that the

15

district court give you a 1292(b) order before the court

16

remanded the case, so that you could have gotten the

17

case -- the question up on appeal?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

I don't believe that we did,

19

Justice Ginsburg.

20

motions for clarification were subsequently brought.

21

But a 1292(b) order was not requested by Powerex.

22

This case was remanded.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

A motion -

Because that would have

23

taken care of it if the district judge agreed to delay

24

the remand to allow this question of law to be

25

determined by the court of appeals.
10

MR. FREDERICK:

It is certainly the case

2

that in searching through the docket entries, you'll

3

discover that there was a holding by the district court

4

of the remand, which is in itself an unusual procedure.

5

But the point that is important here is that

6

even apart from that, when the court had jurisdiction

7

pursuant to the removal provisions, it did not lose

8

subject matter jurisdiction by finding the immunity

9

claims upon the part of the Federal and foreign

10

sovereigns.

And it is their theory that the district

11

court never had subject matter jurisdiction, and that

12

has to be wrong because it conflicts with the purposes

13

behind the removal provision to give the sovereigns the

14

opportunity to litigate their immunity defenses in

15

Federal court.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Their submission in this

Court, however, is that there was no subject matter

5

whenever there's an erroneous remand, the practical

problems that you raise are present.

Diversity is different,

Justice Scalia, and here's why.

examine the bases of diversity.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

What, what's

23

notable is that Congress enacted 1447(e) at the same

24

time that it amended 1447(c).

25

for an authority to remand in a particular instance

It provided in 1447(e)

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

where the court lost subject matter jurisdiction

2

post-removal.

3

Court's decision in St. Paul Mercury Indemnity, that

4

post-removal events did not defeat the removal court's

5

jurisdiction; and in the statute it was made explicit

6

that 1447(c) authorized remand only when the case was

7

removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.

It had of course been the rule since this

8

And when Congress amended the language in

9

1998 to make clear that non-jurisdictional defects in

10

removal had to be raised immediately or were forfeited,

11

it at the same time -- and added the language, or

12

changed the language in the second sentence that raises

13

problems for our argument; at the same time, it added

14

1447(e) to provide, as I said, a particular authority to

15

remand based on post-removal events that would have been

16

unnecessary if, as Respondents urge, 1447(c) was

17

intended to confer general authority to remand on the

18

basis of post-removal events.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you don't have

20

any doubt that a remand under 1447(e) would be covered

21

by 1447(d), do you?

22

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No.

And the courts

23

of appeals that have considered that question likewise

But -- but that

But what is significant is that had Congress

5

intended by the amendment of 1447(c) to authorize for

6

the first time remand on the basis of post-removal

7

events, 1447(e) would have been unnecessary; and yet,

8

the legislative history, the 1447(e), makes clear that

9

Congress believed that in the absence of that provision,

10

the Court would have been limited to two alternatives.

11

Authorize the joinder -- or deny the joinder, or dismiss

12

the case.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How is that relevant here?

Where is the post-removal event?

sovereign immunity.

district court's view, would there have been original

jurisdiction against Powerex?

5

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

No, it would not

have.

Bit that's because of the peculiarities of the

7

difference between original jurisdiction under the FSIA,

8

section 1330(a), and removal jurisdiction under the

FSIA.

Whereas original jurisdiction depends upon a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD B. SIMON,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10
11

Thanks,

MR. SIMON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

12

There are two reasons, independent and

13

sufficient reasons why there is in appellate

14

jurisdiction in this case.

15

simple reason to vacate the decision below for lack of

16

jurisdiction, is to follow this Court's precedents which

17

accept the district court's remand order for what it is

18

and what it says it is, a remand for lack of subject

19

matter jurisdiction under 1447(c), unremovable under

20

1447(d).

21

The first most narrow and

That is a simple direct route to that result.
There is a second approach suggested by a

22

lot of the briefing and some of the argument Your Honors

23

have heard this morning.

24

briefly for the Court.

25

And I want to lay it out

And it is that, as the law professor amici
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have suggested, there is some amount of confusion in the

2

lower courts, I might say with due respect, evasion of

3

1447(d) in the lower courts, by judge-made exceptions to

4

1447(d), created by some but not all of the courts of

5

appeal.

6

And the Court could clear out some of this

7

underbrush, mooting many of the issues that

8

Mr. Frederick and the that Solicitor General have

9

raised.

Thermtron after Carnegie Mellon, addressing the

10

question Justice Kennedy raised in his concurring

11

opinion, in Things Remembered versus Petrarca, Thermtron

12

does not say what many of the lower courts think it

13

does.

14

does, because Thermtron has been partially overruled by

15

Carnegie Mellon.

16

is a 1447(c) remand is ancient history after Carnegie

17

Mellon, and therefore the notion that the only remand

18

covered by 1447(d) is a remand under 1447(c) is also

19

ancient history.

20

Thermtron does not say what my adversaries say it

The notion that the only proper remand

Congress has given us a simple and strong

21

message, which is when we're disputing the forum, when

22

the parties in a case are legitimately and in good faith

And it would have presented two

arguments to the district court.

It would have argued

10

number one, we are a foreign sovereign; maybe it wins,

11

maybe it loses.

And number two.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. SIMON:

We are immune.

Yes.

There is a solid line of cases

14

that suggests the decision on immunity -- first of all

15

let me say, I think it is somewhat far-fetched that a

16

party that would actually be immune, say the King of

17

Saudi Arabia, would end up being in this third lowest

18

category of foreign -- purported foreign sovereigns and

19

end up in the position Powerex is in.

20

But if it did, in other words we have three

21

categories.

We have immunes, we have non-immunes who

22

got Federal court, and then we have would-be foreign

23

sovereigns like Powerex, who end up in State court.

24

I'm suggesting for a party to fall from the first

And the difference is -

And what's the difference

between the one and the other?
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. SIMON:

The difference is that the

2

immunity issue is reviewed on appeal because there is a

3

line of court of appeal cases -- a majority, not a

4

unanimous majority, never blessed by this Court -- which

5

suggests that immunity is so important, don't need a

6

lawyer, you don't go to court, you don't say a word, you

7

don't spend a dollar, you walk away -- so important that

8

you are entitled to an immediate -

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay, and you agree with

that?

11

MR. SIMON:

And I agree with that.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

Then why is it in

13

your opinion that the immunity thing is so important

14

that they get this collateral appeal, but the organ

15

thing is not so important since all, what turns on that

16

is whether they're going to have their non-jury trial.

17

MR. SIMON:

Well, I want to come back

18

non-jury trial and answer Justice Ginsburg's question

19

because I don't think she got the right answer.

20

reason it's more important is this is, as Justice Scalia

21

said, like a diversity decision, this is a litigation

22

who sells power in the Pacific Northwest and admits that

23

it competes with Enron, Duke, and Reliance, and it is

You're saying this all turns

8

on our assessment of the strength of the interest in

9

remaining in Federal court?

10

Is that what it boils down

to?

11

MR. SIMON:

No, it turns on the strength of

12

getting an immediate decision on the immunity question.

13

The immunity question I think is a question of an

14

entirely different nature than the question of forum.

15

In the -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The immunity question,

17

the immunity question is the same as State or Federal

18

court, because the statute as it's written, any foreign

19

sovereign, China, whatever, is as immune from State

20

court jurisdiction as it is from Federal court

21

jurisdiction because Congress said so.

22

But with respect to the commercial

23

enterprise, Congress said, we're going to give you a

24

Federal court and we're going to give you a judge trial.

That doesn't apply to State courts.

What happened to B.C.

Because as I understand the district court sent

MR. SIMON:

The district court found that

19

they were immune, properly followed the law, but

20

determined because it believed it had no subject matter

21

jurisdiction that it should then stop at that point,

22

that it should just walk away from the case and remand

it, over the vehement disagreement of B.C. Hydro and the

24

parallel vehement disagreement of the Bonneville Power

25

MR. SIMON:

So what happens to the three

Well, what's happened so far is

nothing, which might tell us that in the practical world

10

when a Federal district judge says that B.C. Hydro is

11

immune and then remands a multi-plaintiff,

12

multi-defendant, multi-cross defendant-cross defendant

It doesn't speak at all to the issue of 1447.

MR. SIMON:

B.C. Hydro could have attempted

to appeal the immunity decision under a series of

decisions which suggest that immunity is so important

9

that it ought to be decided right then.

JUSTICE ALITO:

immunity and Powerex's status is what?

12

fact that there's a stronger interest in allowing

13

immediate appellate review, Federal appellate review of

14

the determination of the remand of a party that claims

15

to be a sovereign as opposed to Powerex's status as an

16

organ?

22

Again, we have the Kircher

If we think that Powerex,

that there's a strong interest in having Powerex remain

to get around 1447(d)?

3

MR. SIMON:

I think Justice Scalia was

4

correct to say there is just as strong an interest in a

5

diversity case in having a New York corporation trying

6

to escape -

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I'm having, I'm having

8

the same problem as Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer.

9

Can you say in just a few sentences the difference

10

between the case where there is sovereign immunity,

11

China, the China hypothetical, and this case where it's

12

organ immunity?

13

MR. SIMON:

Yes, if I could -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You're telling us that one

15

is more important than the other, but there's no textual

16

basis in the statute for us to make that distinction.

17

MR. SIMON:

I think there are two

18

differences, so if I could.

One is textual and one is

19

important.

20

The textual difference is that 1447(d) speaks to

21

remands, and so to the extent the district court

22

remanded the matter to State court the remand is

23

untouchable on appeal or by mandamus because of 1447(d).

24

And if the foreign -- if the foreign relations body,

25

lobby, doesn't like that, if the State Department

Let me start with the textual difference.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

doesn't like, that they can go to the Capitol and get

2

that fixed quite easily.

3

There are half a dozen exceptions to 1447(d)

4

for class actions, for Native Americans, for civil

5

rights cases, and they can get their own exceptions.

6

to the extent what the trial court did was remand, it is

7

untouchable.

8

i.e. Waco, in which the court says the remand is

9

untouchable, the dismissal of the unnecessary or

That is my textual answer.

So

It's a remand,

10

indispensable party is reviewable.

11

is, although the remand is untouchable, the denial of

12

immunity -- and that's why I kept saying collateral

13

order; I apologize if that confused you, Justice Alito.

14

So what I would say

I meant that line of cases about going

15

straight up even though the case was continuing.

16

the case continues in State court, where it belongs

17

under 1447(d), it would appear under this line of

18

collateral order cases that the denial of immunity

19

per se could go up on its own -

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

While

I'm asking why is denial

21

of immunity for sovereign status different from denial

22

of organ status giving you a right to a bench trial,

23

etcetera?

24
25

MR. SIMON:

Possibly, possibly this could

JUSTICE BREYER:
China is there.

We have this very old judge

2

like me.

And he says:

This isn't

3

China; Formosa is China.

4

we are, China is now in the Western District State Court

5

for Illinois and they're suing them for a lot of money.

6

Now, you said, I thought, before that where that

7

happened, and they wrongly ly denied immunity, they

8

could, China, appeal in the Federal system.

9

you said that.

So he says remand.

I thought

All right.

What?

But not the remand.
All they want is a

16

definitive appeal that this is really China, all right.

17

Now, can they do that, yes or no?

You said yes.

18

So I thought Justice Kennedy's question was,

19

if they can do that, why can't Powerex appeal in exactly

20

the same way on the question of whether they're an

21

organ.

22

What's the difference?
MR. SIMON:

The first difference is what I

23

said in response to Your Honor's question was I think

24

they could do that under some cases from the courts of

25

appeal.

I know they can't appeal the remand because we

13

wherever your hypothetical was, but at the same time, I

do believe that the potentially immune party, which is

party, could seek to review of what is a dispositive

ruling.

They

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Regardless of how they

would get up on it, assuming they could get up on the

23

immunity question, our series of questions is why do we

draw or why should we draw a distinction between

25

immunity and federal bench trial?

And your answer is, I

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

take it, immunity is dispositive; Federal bench tribal

2

is not?

3

MR. SIMON:

Immunity is dispositive and

4

Federal bench trial is not -- and is no different from

5

the day to day decisions district courts make all the

6

time about the choice between a State court and a

MR. SIMON:

A clever enough lawyer I suppose

could argue that at that point that we're no longer

challenging the remand, the remand has happened and been

completed and the trial has taken place; we're now

simply challenging the results.

And in effect he would say

-- I mean, I assume what the clever lawyer would say is,

2

State court, cannot try me at all.

3

they want about remand and it gets back here.

4

because I'm entitled to a bench trial, you cannot try me

5

at all.

The feds can do what
But

Isn't that the argument?

6

MR. SIMON:

Oh, I think in State court a

7

clever litigant could argue all these points over again,

8

because 1447(e) -

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But his clever opponent

would say -

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that what 1447(d) means

13

is that you can be tried in State courts.

14

precisely what it says.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's

And ultimately when the two

16

clever parties got to the State supreme court, they

17

would have these two opposing issues and ultimately if

18

we granted cert this Court would decide it, wouldn't it.

19

MR. SIMON:

This Court would ultimately

20

decide it and they would ultimately decide questions

21

such as whether the jury or, to put it the other, the

22

bench trial issue has been preserved.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not say, depending on

24

the clever lawyers, or non-clever as the case may be,

25

why not just say Congress intended that you do get an
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

underlying appeal in the Federal system, for what is at

2

stake is not simply where the case will be tried, but

3

rather significant and important rights attach in the

4

Federal court that do not attach in the State court.

5

And therefore, it is right, the appeal you get when

6

they -- when what is at stake is immune or not, and by

7

doing that we avoid four more years of litigation and

8

the necessity to hire clever lawyers.

9

MR. SIMON:

Well, Congress has said -

10

Congress has said the contrary.

And there are often

11

important differences between State and Federal courts.

12

Justice Breyer, I think you have some experience in

13

California.

14

have a litigant here next year saying that the

15

difference between a removal and a remand is a unanimous

jury verdict or a 9 to 3 jury verdict, and that's really

important.

We have 9 to 3 jury verdicts.

Mr. Frederick's reply brief says at footnote

4, page 3 -- or footnote 3, page 4; I apologize -- that

6

our right to jury trial is not threatened here and that

7

under certain lower court decisions, which he is correct

8

they do exist -- I'm not sure they're unanimous -- Our

9

right to jury trial would survive even though he would

10

have a right to a bench trial under his theory.

11

Well, there is no right to a jury trial on

12

the cross claim against Mr. Frederick's client.

Mr. Chief Justice, a

non-jury trial is an aspect of sovereign immunity.

This
