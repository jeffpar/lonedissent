We'll hear argument in BP

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. LAMKEN:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:

10

Section 2415(a) established a limitations period

11

for every action for money damages by the Government which

12

is founded on any contract.

13

applies to every contract action, every adversary

14

adjudication seeking monetary compensation for breach,

15

whether pursued before a court or an agency.

16

That provision, by its terms,

The contention that every action encompasses

17

only civil actions or judicial actions is incorrect for

18

three reasons.

19

language that Congress used.

21

the exception for administrative offset, totally

22

superfluous.

25

Turning to the text, Congress

2

before the judiciary.

The term -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. LAMKEN:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What -

-- denotes May I ask you, on that point -

7

I understand what you're saying, and I've looked at your

8

authority, but, right in the provision itself, there is a

9

verbal distinction made between actions for money damages,

10

and what, at the end of the provision, they refer to as

11

"administrative proceedings" in providing for the 1-year

12

supplementary rule.

13

"We don't mean, by 'action,' what we would possibly -

14

what possibly might be included as an administrative

15

proceeding"?

16

proceeding to be a subset of the actions for money

17

damages, wouldn't it have been sensible for Congress to

18

say in -- to refer, instead of to "administrative

19

proceedings," to "administrative actions"?

20

Doesn't the statute, in effect, say,

If they had wanted an administrative

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, in fact, the -- it refers to

21

"administrative proceedings required by contract or law."

22

And that clause applies in the particular circumstance

23

where a law or a contract requires some sort of

24

administrative proceeding as a condition precedent to the

25

action for money damages.

So, if you can bring your
4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

money-damages action without any prior administrative

2

proceeding, regardless of where you bring -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think your point has to be

4

that there are administrative proceedings that are not

5

actions.

6

MR. LAMKEN:

That is absolutely correct.

7

Nonadversarial administrative proceedings would,

8

themselves, not be actions.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
MR. LAMKEN:

Right.

And they also wouldn't be money-

11

damages actions.

12

not between money-damages actions in court and money-

13

damages actions before agencies; it's before money-damages

14

actions, wherever brought, and the administrative

15

proceedings that have to be brought as a condition

16

precedent.

17
18

So, the distinction the statute draws is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You contend that what commenced

the action here was the order demanding payment.

19

MR. LAMKEN:

That is correct.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is the -

That's a very weird

21

commencement of an action, where what then follows is what

22

is referred to as an "appeal," within the agency.

23

MR. LAMKEN:

For historical reasons, the

Yes.

And it's 13 U.S.C. 1724, and

10

it talks -- or it defines the "demand" as the order to

11

12

when they're talking about what commences the action, it

13

says that the order to pay "commences" the action.

12

Federal Tort Claims Act, for example, is in 28 U.S.C., and

13

it has a provision for administrative adjustment of claims.

14

People must file their claims before an agency first, and

then the agency can do administrative adjustment.

15

defendant for damages, all adjudicated before the

16

Secretary of Agriculture, and that was 85 years ago.

17

seems a little late in the day now to debate whether one

can be a defendant, the person who defends before an

19

agency, as well as the defendant -

And

JUSTICE GINSBURG: That wasn't part of the
original statute, was it?
MR. LAMKEN:
later, Your Honor.

No, that was added about 16 years

And it was added, but it clarifies the

10

scope of the statute.

11

pointed out in cases like Fausto and LaFranca, the later

12

amendment to a statute can clarify its meaning; and,

13

indeed, statutes are ordinarily read, once amended, as if

14

they existed in their amended form from the offset.

15

And, as this Court admitted in -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. LAMKEN:

What -

-- sort of administrative

proceeding.

4

fact, this applies to administrative proceedings, and it

5

simply doesn't apply to administrative offsets, because

6

they're an exception.

7

And that raises the strong inference that, in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They could have said -- if the

8

other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to

9

administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have

10

said the provisions of this section do not apply to

11

administrative proceedings -

12

MR. LAMKEN:

That's -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- which would have -- which

14

would have handled the offset -

15

MR. LAMKEN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

beyond the offset.

Yes.

It would have -- but would have been well

And the fact -

18

MR. LAMKEN:

That's exactly right.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that they only focus on the

20

offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking

21

about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.

22

MR. LAMKEN:

I could not have said it better,

23

and I will not attempt to.

In fact, in addition, it

24

raises another anomaly in the statute, the Government's

25

contrary construction.

And that is, it creates sort of an

irrationality in the hierarchy of claims for the

2

Government.

3

from private individuals must be brought within 6 years.

4

Administrative offsets for the Government to try and avoid

5

paying money, those must be brought within 10 years, under

6

the administrative offset provision that was enacted

7

together with the exception in (i).

8

administrative actions to extract money may be brought in

However, offensive

It simply strains credulity to

10

believe that Congress, at the same time it was saying the

14

allow the individual to know that he will no longer

16

17

pursuing its claims.

Is it also possible to say that

24

there was this disagreement between the Department of

25

Justice and the Comptroller General, and Congress decided
19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the Comptroller General was right?

And, if that's

2

true, should we not accept the Comptroller General's

3

reading of the entire statute?

4

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, if Congress had decided the

5

Comptroller General is right, and had done that in

6

subsection (i), it would have written subsection (i) the

7

way Justice Scalia proposed, which is to say this doesn't

8

apply to administrative claims at all.

9

What it did is, it

and the Comptroller thinks these administrative offsets are

11

important, so we will give a special statute of

limitations period in 31 U.S.C. for those, and exempt them

13

from the more general statute of limitations period in

14

section 28 U.S.C. 2415."

should be read that way.

Well So, the question is, How -- you

know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to

administrative proceedings in this case?

13

pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it

way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations

15

whatever for the Government in these cases.

16

MR. JOSEFFER:

And I find it

Well, the structure of the law

17

here is that in those instances where Congress does

18

authorize administrative recovery, it ordinarily provides

19

a context-specific administrative limitations period, such

20

as in the Contract Disputes Act, which governs almost all

21

of the contract claims the Government can pursue

22

administratively.

23

limitations period for the submission of a claim to a

24

contracting officer.

25

Congress specifically enacted a 6-year

In this unique context, however, Congress had
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

very good reasons for not applying a limitations period

2

until it prospectively enacted a partial one in 1996.

3

reason is that what Congress found here, in context of

4

mineral leasing, based on the findings of an independent

5

commission, was that the companies were historically on an

6

honors system and had abused that by underpaying royalties

7

of up to half a billion dollars annually.

8

Congress directed the agency to do is to audit all current

9

and past lease accounts.

The

So, what

One of the committee reports

10

said to focus on old accounts, because this was a Congress

11

that was not concerned with repose, but with getting some

12

of those vast underpayments back from the companies.

13

Now, when we fast-forward to 1996 --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

Wait.
-- at that point Excuse me.

And this was the

Congress that enacted what?
MR. JOSEFFER:

No, I -- agreed.

What I'm

19

referring to now is the Congress that enacted the mineral

20

leasing provisions.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. JOSEFFER:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

Oh.
-- which is not a good Which is not what we're talking

about here.
MR. JOSEFFER:

No, but -- well, we are, because
24

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the structure of the law here is that Section 2415(a), as

2

we see it, governs court suits.

3

when Congress authorizes administrative recovery, it

4

almost always provides a specific -- context-specific

5

administrative limitations period.

6

And that works, because,

Also, when Congress was telling the agency to

7

focus on old accounts, it certainly wasn't thinking that a

8

statute of limitations applied to that, and the agency, in

9

that contemporary context, did not understand that there

10

was a limitations period, either, because the orders that

11

issued in the aftermath of the 1982 Act went back 7, 8, 9,

12

sometimes more, years than that.

13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As late as 1978, the Justice

Department didn't think that way, did it?

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, the Justice DepartmentThe opinion of the Office of

17

Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner

18

here would urge.

19

MR. JOSEFFER:

No, the OLC opinion was limited,

20

by both its terms and its reasoning, to administrative

21

offsets, not to administrative adjudications.

22

could explain that, an administrative offset occurs in the

23

situation -- this is what OLC was looking at -- where the

24

Government, by statute, owed retirement benefits to a

25

person, and, because it thought that person owed it money,
25
Alderson Reporting Company

And if I

Official

1

what the Government did was to unilaterally reduce the

2

retirement benefits.

3

nothing more than a prejudgment attachment.

4

thought that if the Government is time-barred from

5

obtaining a judgment, it should be time-barred from

6

obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

7

What OLC opined is that that is a -And OLC

An administrative adjudication is significantly

8

different, because it does provide an actual judgment.

9

So, there are a couple of important points from that.

10

First is that the dispute between OLC and the

11

Comptroller General was limited by its terms to

12

administrative offsets, although, Justice Stevens, the

13

Comptroller General did opine beyond that, that the

14

statute specifically applies only to suits in court.

But

15

the actual dispute was as to administrative offsets.

So,

16

when Congress addressed that specific dispute, as Justice

17

Alito pointed out, it resolved only that specific dispute.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- excuse me -- how could

19

OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative

20

offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings?

21

I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which

22

you're urging here, which is that this statute applies

23

only to judicial proceedings.

24

Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position

25

taken by the Justice Department was that this statute

I mean, that's the point.

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

relates to administrative proceedings.

2

MR. JOSEFFER:

No, the position of OLC was

3

limited to administrative offsets, and it did not -- the

4

important thing is, OLC opinion did not interpret the

5

statutory term "action," or, frankly, any other statutory

6

term.

7

that administrative offsets are unique because they are

8

prejudgment attachment devices.

9

went to Congress, and that's the dispute that Congress

10

Instead, it had a theory, which was probably wrong,

That's the dispute that

actually resolved.

11

And, in any event, going forward -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, on that theory, then,

13

there was -- there was no time issue with respect to the

14

right to offset, then, in the OLC's position.

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

No, the OLC's view is that if the

16

Government was time-barred from obtaining a judgment under

17

Section 2415(a), then it would be time-barred from

18

obtaining a prejudgment attachment.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but I thought your -- in

20

answer to Justice Scalia, you said what was essential to

21

the -- to OLC's position was that the offset is like a

22

prejudgment attachment, and, in effect, it's an attachment

Conversely, as Justice Scalia

Alderson Reporting Company

2

therefore, must have been assumed to apply to

4

So, either there's no time question with respect

5

to the offsets, or, if there is a time question with

6

respect to the offsets, it implies an OLC position that

7

this provision applies to administrative proceedings.

We -- I agree, though, that terms -- to get back

13

to the beginning of this discussion -- terms do not always

14

have their ordinary meanings, but they presumptively do,

15

especially when a statute must be strictly construed.

16

here, the context confirms that "action" does have its

17

ordinary meaning, for several reasons.

18

And

First, the ordinary meanings of the other key

19

statutory terms, such as "right of action," "complaint,"

20

and "defendant," as Justice Ginsberg pointed out, all

21

ordinarily refer to aspects of suits in court.

22

23

"defendant" is the person defending in court ordinarily;

proceedings by stating a claim that's seeking relief in a

civil action, which is a suit in court.

Especially when

2

those terms are used together, this Court recognized, in

4

action by filing a complaint ordinarily refers to filing a

5

suit in court, not a pleading before an administrative

6

agency.

7

an action against an administrative proceeding by saying

8

that the time to file an action does not run until after

9

the administrative proceedings have concluded, which

23

mean, historically, administrative -- obviously, court

24

suits have been around a lot longer than administrative

25

adjudications.

I think the reason is that -- I

And, as Congress has authorized

administrative adjudications, it's dealt with them on a

2

case-by-case basis.

3

With

1

respect to the second of those, an issue letter does not

-- is not an allegation of wrongdoing, and it does not

10

11

is that, "We've done an audit, and the audit has raised

12

the following issues" -- that's why it's called an "issue

13

letter" -- "Please provide an explanation."

14

at that point, the agency has not decided yet whether it

15

is, in fact, asserting a claim.

requesting relief, which a complaint definitely does.

it's requesting is information to help the agency assess

to -- unless there is no possible other reading of the

provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years

Government does not have enough resources to audit all of

the reasons that we need to be able to go back farther

15

a result, the notion that we're going to pull auditing

18

One is that the

In addition, the farther we try to go back, the

greater the proof problems, because oftentimes only the

companies have the information that shows what royalties

14

Government bears the initial burden of going forward, if

15

the company destroys the sources of proof, that's, on

16

balance, going to be in its favor.

17

there's not a strict congruence between the 6-year

18

periods, because, first, the companies only have to keep

19

records for 6 years, but, in some circumstances, the

20

Secretary can require they be kept for longer.

21

addition, sometimes the statute of limitations, because of

22

tolling, is much longer than 6 years; and so, the lawful

23

destruction of records would still leave absence-of-proof

24

issues in situations where the statute might, because of

25

tolling, be much longer.

But, in addition,

In

So, there's not a strict

congruence.
There is also no indication that Congress

enacted the 6-year records-retention policy because it was

4

thinking about a 6-year limitations period.

5

been any linkage between the two.

6

There's never

If I could briefly cover, then, also -- I mean,

7

in addition to all the textual points, this is also

8

located in the judicial code.

9

that a couple stray provisions in the judicial code apply

And, although it's true

10

to administrative proceedings, they say that expressly.

11

Every time the word "action" is used in the judicial code

12

-- and Petitioners identified no examples -- every time

13

the word "action" is used in the judicial code, it refers

14

to a suit in court, and only a suit in court.

15

When a provision of the judicial code applies to

16

something else, it will say so.

For example, 28 U.S. Code

17

2462, which is a statute of limitations for penalty

18

proceedings, refers to an "action, suit, or proceeding."

19

The Federal Tort Claims Act is very clear that what

20

it's talking about is submitting something to an agency.

21

So, if Congress was going to legislate against

22

the backdrop of a strict construction canon with terms

23

that ordinarily refer to suits in court, and put the

24

provision in the judicial code, I mean, that just is a

25

totally irrational way of expressing intent, especially
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

clear -- especially a clear intent, when it's trying to

2

govern administrative proceedings.

3

The committee reports also strongly confirm

4

that, because they not only say that the statute defines

5

the time limitation for bringing an action in the U.S.

6

courts, and not only use court terminology from front to

7

back, they also say, like the statute, that they're aware

8

of the administrative proceedings, but what they're saying

9

is that the time to bring an action in the courts does not

10

expire until after the conclusion of those proceedings.

11

The committee has explained that the reason for

12

that provision was the great number and variety of

13

administrative proceedings.

14

was saying, "There's a great variety of administrative

15

procedure.

16

We're taking it off the table by saying this limitations

17

period does not expire until a year after those

18

administrative proceedings, whatever they might be, have

19

expired."

20

So, in other words, Congress

We're just not going to deal with that here.

There's also some relevance in the fact that

21

this legislation was proposed by the Justice Department as

22

part of an overall package of reforms that would govern

23

the civil litigation that the Department was handling in

24

the courts.

25

Committees, not to the House Government Reform Committees

It was then referred to the Judiciary

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that might consider administrative procedure matters, and,

2

as I mentioned before, was enacted as part of the judicial

3

code.

4

From start to finish, this legislation has never

5

had anything to do with anything other than court suits,

6

which is why Congress has expressly provided for

7

context-specific administrative systems -- limitations

8

periods -- which make sense in the context of the relevant

9

administrative procedures.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, except when you -- when

11

you say "this legislation," you limit it to the body of

12

2415(a) and you leave out (i), which -- -- or I guess it's

13

"one."

Is it?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

things doubly clear -- okay? -- that (a) does not apply to

19

administrative proceedings.

20

argument if the way (i) was written is, "The provisions of

21

this section shall not apply to administrative

22

proceedings."

23

that was always the case, and this is just making it

24

clear."

25

And I could

I could understand that

And then I would say, "You know, oh, well,

means, to me, when I read the statute as a whole -- and

7

that's the way I read statutes, I don't ask whether this

8

section was adopted this year, and the other section was

9

adopted next year -- I don't do it bite by bite; you look

10

at the whole text -- and, when you read all this stuff

11

together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that

12

administrative proceedings, despite the fact that "action"

13

is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.

14

MR. JOSEFFER:

I mean, it's -- there's no doubt

15

the statute should be read as a whole.

16

has explained in cases like the O'Gilvie and Vonn cases

17

cited in our brief, when a court's trying to make sense of

18

a statute read as a whole, oftentimes it will find that

19

when Congress faces a specific dispute and amends a

20

statute to resolve that specific dispute, that's all it

21

resolves, and there's no reason to draw further negative

22

inference, especially here, as the Court of Appeals

23

pointed out, where a strict construction canon applies.

is an important point, that the statute applies only if it

4

best that Petitioners can do is to say that some of the

5

statutory terms, in isolation, are ambiguous.

6

all that means, as I said, is that, under the strict

construction canon, we would prevail.

that it begins proceedings, because it comes between an

contexts in administrative procedure in which the word

by 2415(a).
MR. JOSEFFER:

occurral of a right of action, which refers to the right

to bring suit in court, in a statute which then juxtaposes

MR. JOSEFFER:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. JOSEFFER:

-- fundamental point than that,

6

too, is that what Congress was doing here was, when using

7

these terms in their ordinary sense, to lay out an across-

8

the-board rule that applies to suits in court.

9

And, finally, one thing I should also emphasize

10

is that what we have in this context is a comprehensive

11

administrative scheme.

12

"Well, we could just as easily be in court."

13

reason that no administrative royalty proceeding has ever

14

been brought by the Government in a court.

17

gave the agency administrative authority to enforce its

18

administrative orders.

20

"Section 1981(a) does not, however, define the term

'action' as being limited to judicial proceedings.

statutory language, read in context, suggests that no such

limitation was intended."

It has

And that's rather

It is -- that the response to a

complaint is an appeal.
MR. LAMKEN:

The language that has been used,

11

and -- as a result of very odd historical anomalies and

12

attempts to introduce a sense of due process to these

13

proceedings over time -- is odd, and it is awkward.

14

it's clear that when Congress wrote the scope of this

15

statute, it said it applies to "every action for money

16

damages by the Government which is founded in contract."

17

It doesn't say "actions that are begun by complaint."

18

But

Now, the complaint is what Congress assumes will

19

stop the provision from running.

20

Yes.

Of course.

MR. LAMKEN:

Right.

It may have to be from some

MR. LAMKEN:

There are -- there are some

contexts in which there already is a separate

than the relatively more recent claims.

14

Finally, I'd like to say, one moment about the

statute -- the canon of strict construction.

And that is

16

that it doesn't always require the court to narrow

otherwise broad statutory language, particularly where

18

doing so would have the effect of rendering another

19

provision -- here, subsection (i) is superfluous --

20
