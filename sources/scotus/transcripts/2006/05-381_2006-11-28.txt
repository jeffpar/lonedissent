ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The question in this case is whether the

12

standards this Court adopted in Brooke Group to

13

determine whether a seller's prices violate the

14

antitrust laws because they are too low also should

15

apply in assessing the claim that the buyer's purchase

16

prices are illegally high.

17

Group test applies because the four key underpinnings of

18

the Court's ruling apply fully here.

19

We submit that the Brooke

First, there's a high risk of mistaking

20

aggressive competition for anticompetitive behavior.

21

Increasing the prices that are paid for inputs like

22

lowering sales prices is a mechanism by which a firm

23

competes.

24

buyer's ordinary competitive instincts.

25

targeted here is on its face identical to core

It's the result that we would expect from a

Alderson Reporting Company

So the conduct

procompetitive conduct.

2

3

competitor from hard -- to anticompetitive behavior, but

4

the antitrust laws -

5

It's also very hard to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Can I ask you a

6

preliminary question before you get too far into your

7

argument?

8

instructions to the jury were that finding that

9

predatory price cutting was in itself sufficient to

Is it your understanding that the

10

establish a Section 2 violation?

11

Appeals opinion reads that way but is it, do you think

12

the jury was so instructed?

13

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

I know the Court of

Our position is that that

14

is what the jury was instructed, because the predatory

15

pricing instruction said one of plaintiff's contentions

16

is that defendant purchased more logs than needed or

17

paid a higher price for logs than necessary in order to

18

prevent the plaintiffs from obtaining the logs they

19

needed at a fair price.

the appendix to the petition.

21

you find this to be true, you may regard it as an

22

anticompetitive act.

23

I'm reading from page 14(a) of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And then it concluded, if

You may consider it as an

24

anticompetitive act, but it does not say you may regard

25

it as a violation of Section 2.

1

MR. PINCUS:

No.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And as I read the

3

instructions, it did require there be three elements of

4

the violation of Section 2 which, two of which were not

5

discussed by the Court of Appeals.

6

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, there is no,

7

there is no contention here about monopoly power.

8

focus here is on the conduct element of Section 2.

9
10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you concede there is

monopoly power?

11
12

The

MR. PINCUS:

We are not disputing it before

this Court.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is that relevant to

14

the question whether, if there is monopoly power plus an

15

attempt to preserve that power or require that power,

16

plus an anticompetitive act, is that a violation of

17

section 2.

18

MR. PINCUS:

Well, Your Honor, our view is

19

what the Court has said in cases like Trinko, is that

20

the test is monopoly power and anticompetitive conduct.

21

Those are the two elements.

22

monopoly power element.

23

was anticompetitive conduct here.

24
25

We are not contesting the

We are looking at whether there

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But you do agree that the

conduct in itself is not sufficient to establish a
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

violation, the question of whether the conduct plus the

2

monopoly power -

3

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

Because this is a claim

4

under Section 2, there would have to be either monopoly

5

power or a danger of probability to the monopoly power.

6

It's single firm conduct so there would have to be -

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And so you're arguing not

8

only that the pricing conduct was not itself sufficient

9

to prove a violation, but it also was not even an

10

anticompetitive act that may give rise to damages?

11

MR. PINCUS:

Yes, Your Honor.

We are

12

arguing both things.

13

is much space between the two, but to the extent there

14

is, we are arguing both.

15

I think, I'm not sure that there

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Obviously, if there's just

16

an anticompetitive act without a violation of the

17

statute, then there would be no basis for damages.

18

MR. PINCUS:

I think that's right, but I

19

guess the way I think the Court has approached

20

determining anticompetitive act, anticompetitive

21

conduct, is it's the kind of conduct when engaged in by

22

a monopolist or an entity that has a dangerous

23

probability of cheating it, it is a violation of this

24

statute.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course in the Brooke

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case, it may not have even been a monopolist.

2

MR. PINCUS:

Well, because Brooke involved a

3

claim under the Patent Act.

4

Trinko case has certainly interpreted the Brooke

5

Standard as also applying to claims under Section 2.

6

And in fact the Court explicitly said that in Brooke

7

Group.

8
9
10

But this Court in the

As I said, the first critical underpinning
is the risk of mistaking aggressive competition for
anticompetitive behavior.

11

Second, this case involves -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's a little

12

different here in that in the Brooke Group cases, of

13

course, the alleged anticompetitive conduct was pricing

14

too low, which has at least a direct benefit to

15

consumers either in the short term, certainly in the

16

short term, and arguably in the long-term as well, while

17

here that is not the form in which the anticompetitive

18

conduct, that's not the form the anticompetitive conduct

19

takes.

20

should apply the Brooke Group test to this situation?

21

So isn't that a reason not to think that we

MR. PINCUS:

Your Honor, we don't, we don't

22

think that that difference is a distinction that

23

warrants a different test, for several reasons.

24

of all, we are dealing here with single firm pricing

25

conduct and it's recognized that that's key to the
7
Alderson Reporting Company

First

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

proper functioning of the markets.

2

Professional Engineers, fixed pricing is the central

3

nervous system of the economy.

4

ensures that, that they are allocated to the most

5

efficient use.

6

As the court said in

It allocates goods and

Here, although there's no immediate benefit

7

to consumers, there is an immediate benefit to the

8

sellers of the logs, who certainly benefit when

9

competition drives up the prices that they achieve.

And

10

we think that the Sherman Act protects them and gives

11

them the benefit of full competition just as much as it

12

does consumers.

13

Over the course -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Have we ever

14

identified that as a benefit that the antitrust laws try

15

to achieve, people get higher prices for what they sell?

16

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

In Mandeville Farms,

17

which was a Section 1 case, the Court did talk about the

18

fact that the antitrust laws protect sellers as well as

19

buyers, and that was a case in which there was allegedly

20

a Section 1 conspiracy to price too low, and the Court

21

said that's per se unlawful.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So in Brooke Group,

23

we said it's a benefit when prices are low to consumers,

24

and in this other case we said it's a benefit when

25

prices are high to suppliers.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PINCUS:

Because the benefit that I

2

think the Court is looking at in both cases is not the

3

particular price levels, but in achieving and ensuring

4

free price competition because of the central role that

5

price plays in the economy.

6

trying to protect in Professional Real Estate -- in

7

Professional Engineers -

8
9

That's what the Court is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume it's a benefit to

consumers if the supply of the needed goods is increased

10

because of higher prices being paid for those needed

11

goods, and I assume when a higher price is paid, more of

12

those goods will be forthcoming, which will benefit

13

consumers who want those goods.

14
15
16

MR. PINCUS:

That is our second argument,

Justice Scalia.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you don't have that

17

in this case, do you, because I thought the, I thought

18

one of the arguments on the other side was the

19

inelasticity of the supplies, so that no matter what

20

they were paying, basically the same amount of wood was

21

ultimately going to get processed; is that correct?

22

MR. PINCUS:

No, Your Honor.

The claim is

23

that the supply was relatively inelastic, not that it's

24

perfectly inelastic, and as long as the supply market is

25

not perfectly inelastic, an increase in price may lead
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to more supplies, maybe not as much as if there were

2

higher elasticity, but more.

3

benefit to consumers here, which is that if one would

4

expect that a buyer bidding more can make a more

5

efficient use of the product and therefore generate more

6

output, and that output expansion which doesn't depend

7

on supply expansion is also beneficial to consumers

8

because that means there will be more output in the

9

downstream market and a corresponding decrease in price.

10

But there's another

So we have those two benefits to consumers

11

and we also have the fact that as the Court said in

12

Professional Engineers, the Sherman Act reflects a

13

judgment that price competition generally, a free and

14

open price competition will produce lower prices and

15

better goods and services, and the Court has not

16

required that that be traced to consumer welfare in

17

every particular case.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I presume it could lead to

19

lower consumer prices too.

If you have a firm that has

20

developed a new, a new technique for processing the

21

logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and

22

sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and

23

thereby make even more profit, that firm would be

24

willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would

25

sell them for less than competitors might sell them.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. PINCUS:

That's exactly right, Justice

2

Scalia, and that's what the record reflects here, that

3

Weyerhaeuser invested in its lumber mills and created a

4

process that got more value out of a log.

5

reflects that plaintiffs, for example, did not do that.

6

And there is testimony that plaintiff's mill was quite,

7

relatively inefficient compared to Weyerhaeuser.

8

Weyerhaeuser invested new processes that had less waste,

9

produced more output as Justice Scalia suggested, and

The record

10

therefore it was able to sell, sell that output at a

11

lower price and still make a profit, because it was

12

getting more output for log and therefore could pay more

13

for the log.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But was there any argument as to how to

MR. PINCUS:

Well, our view, Justice

22

Kennedy, there really wasn't, because the district judge

23

had made clear his view in the pretrial motions that

24

there wasn't a need to prove prices, and that -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that was the end of it

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at the trial court.

2

MR. PINCUS:

But our position is, and there

3

has certainly been some writing on this in the

4

literature, is that what one does is take the cost of

5

producing the output which includes the allegedly

6

predatory price of the log, and here logs are 75 percent

7

of the cost so it's a very big cost.

8

costs to the revenues that are received in the

9

downstream market and if those revenues exceed costs,

Compare those

10

then you're in a position where the defendant is

11

behaving perfectly economically rationally.

12

less, then you go on to recoup it.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If they're

Mr. Pincus, how do you

14

determine the price of the logs?

Because we, the

15

charges that some logs were purchased at an excessive

16

price, and if we were dealing with only those logs to

17

determine cost, that's one thing.

18

this picture is that some of the logs came from

19

Weyerhaeuser's own land and some came from long-term

20

contracts that it had, and those, the price was not

21

inflated on those.

22

you may get one figure, but if you take only the high

23

bid logs you might get a different picture.

24

what is it?

25

all the logs that were purchased or only the ones that

But we are, also in

So if you take those into account

How do you determine costs?

12
Alderson Reporting Company

So how,

Do you look at

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

were allegedly bid out?

2

MR. PINCUS:

No.

You would look, you would

3

look, Your Honor, at all of the, at all of the logs,

4

just as in the downstream market if you have a sell side

5

case, you look at, you look at prices of all sales.

6

Here it's interesting that the record reflects that

7

plaintiff received more than, between 30 and 50 percent

8

of its logs from the same kind of long-term sources that

9

it argues that Weyerhaeuser received it from.

So in

10

this case there really isn't the kind of disparity, but

11

our position would be that you add all of those up and

12

compare them to revenues.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not clear to me that

14

we have to get into this but if we do, I'm not sure

15

about your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question.

16

you have your own logs that you own already and if you

17

have logs on a long-term contract, the only relevant

18

logs are the logs that both people are competing for.

19

That's the only relevant market that we are talking

20

about insofar as the purchaser is concerned.

21

MR. PINCUS:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If

And it might be And if Weyerhaeuser wanted

23

to drive somebody out of the market, then they go after

24

the logs which are open to both parties.

25

MR. PINCUS:

And Your Honor, as the Court
13

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

observed in Brooke Group, there really wasn't a need

2

there to get into how the test works and we think there

3

isn't here.

4

might be that the focus is on the incremental costs that

5

are associated with the alleged predatory volume, and

6

therefore that might focus on those incremental costs.

7

But in this case there's no dispute that, whatever the

8

measure of costs, there has been no challenge to the

9

position that Weyerhaeuser's prices were above those

10

We think the issue is symmetrical and it

costs.

11

Let me just turn back to, to the other two

12

reasons why we think Brooke Group applies because I

13

think they're important.

14

likely that the high bids here were going to, were a

15

result of legitimate competition than of anticompetitive

16

effort.

17

and Matsushita, predatory conduct is self-deterring.

18

engage in it, the defendant has to be willing to incur a

19

near-term loss against the hope of higher returns later.

20

And as the Court explained in those cases, the loss is

21

definite but the gain depends on a number of

22

imponderables.

23

The third is it's much more

As this Court has observed both in Brooke Group

So there is some self-deterring.

And finally, a test that provides no

24

guidance threatens false positives that will deter the

25

very competition that our economy requires and that
14
Alderson Reporting Company

To

helps our economy reach its most efficient state.

As

2

Justice Breyer put it for the First Circuit in Town of

3

Comfort, antitrust rules must be clear enough for

4

lawyers to explain them to their clients, especially in

5

a sensitive area like pricing.

6

that the Ninth Circuit adopted here has none of that

7

clarity and we think that the Court's Brooke Group

8

decision and that test does.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And certainly the rule

May I ask this question?

10

Supposing the evidence was perfectly clear that the

11

company did engage in a plan to get a total monopoly and

12

there were minutes of the board of directors says that

13

in order to do this we've got to drive company X out of

14

business and so you, we want you to compete in every

15

transaction with company X that you can and buy the logs

16

at a higher price.

17

even if it did not result in loss to the defendant?

18
19
20

Would that be an anticompetitive act

MR. PINCUS:

And the only anticompetitive

conduct alleged was pricing conduct, Your Honor?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

The

21

anticompetitive -- the plan is to drive the company out

22

of business.

23

than proving the whole objective is that you pick on

24

this one competitor and outbid him every time you can.

25

Could that possibly give rise to a damage claim?

acquire a monopoly.

8

MR. PINCUS:

And the reason for that,

9

Justice Stevens, is it's very hard to distinguish,

10

especially for the judicial system to distinguish,

11

between hard-fought competition and anticompetitive

12

intent if all we're looking at is what's in people's

18

MR. PINCUS:

Well, because there won't be a

19

given premise in every case, Your Honor, and the problem

20

is the Court has to write rules that will, that will

21

govern conduct, primary conduct of business people in

22

the market, and a rule that says if you can prove intent

23

then you don't have to worry about prices and costs is a

rule that opens the door to second-guess, judicial

There aren't too many

cases that fit this.
MR. PINCUS:

As the Court has recognized in

8

the section 2 context, the problem of deterring

9

procompetitive conduct is even more serious because you

10

don't have the threshold environment of proof of

11

conspiracy, as one does in section 1.

12

with unilateral conduct, and so -

you to be disputing the resolution of that issue.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

correlative situation where there is an allegation of

Alderson Reporting Company

Namely

3

MR. PINCUS:

It would not establish a

violation, Your Honor.

5

dealt with that very case because the dissent in Brooke

had held that the intent evidence was amongst the most

That did not involve monopoly power.
MR. PINCUS:

predatory pricing, Your Honor, under Robinson-Patman.

15

But the Court said its test was perfectly applicable to

16

section 2.

17

that test in just that way in section 2 cases.

18

the rule would be that even in the predatory selling

19

situation intent can override the price-cost and the

20

recoupment requirements, then you're in a situation

21

where there's no ability for business people to know in

Well, that is also true, and

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In your view, if as the

power, plus anticompetitive acts, does the

10

anticompetitive act have to be in and of itself a

violation of the Sherman Act?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think you need to

have all three of those elements in order to state a

claim of attempted monopolization -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if you do have all

three, is that enough to prove a violation?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but if it was not

correct?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is correct, Justice

Stevens, and the jury was also instructed and in our

view the jury was properly instructed with regard to the

8

other two elements, namely a dangerous probability of

monopolization and a specific intent to monopolize.

10

sole question before this Court is what constitutes

exclusionary conduct for purposes of section 2, what

constitutes it regardless of whether it's a claim of

attempted monopolization or actual monopolization.

it may be powerful evidence, of a monopolistic intent,

though courts have noted that even with regard to that

between a legitimate competitive attempt on the one hand

and an illegitimate monopolistic intent.

conduct that is classed as exclusionary, and in our view

And I think that the

Official - Subject to Final Review

colloquy is that the Court really did confront this

issue in Brooke Group.

3

of monopolistic intent and the majority opinion -

4

There was fairly strong evidence

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But there is no evidence

5

of monopoly power and it isn't even remotely at issue in

6

that case.

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's right, and it wasn't

8

an issue simply because it was a Robinson-Patman Act

9

case and all that is required under the Robinson-Patman

10

Act is the possibility of harm to competition and there

11

was some disagreement about whether a showing had been

12

made of that requisite possibility between the majority

13

opinion and your dissenting opinion.

14

that there was any disagreement in Brooke Group with

15

regard to the relevant standard for exclusionary

conduct.

17

recoupment would be necessary in order to state the

predatory pricing claim in the Robinson-Patman Act

context.

20

But I don't think

Even the dissenting opinion recognized that

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would your answer be the

21

same if you added to Justice Stevens' hypothetical very

22

high barriers of entry that would prevent other

23

competitors from entering the market after the target

24

was driven out?

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

High barriers to entry,
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Alito, would be very relevant to the inquiry

2

under the second prong of the Brooke Group standard,

3

namely whether the defendant had a dangerous probability

4

of recoupment in the long term.

5

predation cases, many predatory pricing cases in the 13

6

years since Brooke Group, barriers to entry have been

7

absolutely vital in resolving predatory pricing claims

8

at the summary judgment stage, because typically

9

defendants will make the argument that the absence of

And indeed in many

10

barriers to entry make the possibility of recoupment

11

unlikely.

12

into the Brooke Group standard and it certainly would be

13

part of the Brooke Group analysis in the predatory

14

bidding context as well.

15

But that is a consideration that is built

I want to say just one thing in response to

16

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kennedy's questions to my

17

friend Mr. Pincus about the question of the appropriate

18

measure of cost if Brooke Group were to apply to

19

predatory bidding claims.

20

believe that it is unnecessary for this Court to specify

21

the exact method of calculating costs in this case.

22

the position of the United States more generally both in

23

the predatory pricing context and in the predatory

24

bidding context is that a Court should look to a

25

defendant's incremental costs, and in this context that

As in Brooke Group itself, we

26
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would mean looking to the amount of the input that was

2

the subject of the alleged predation.

3

the amount of logs that petitioner allegedly predatorily

4

purchased on the open market.

5

approach to be sure is not within its difficulties in

6

application and for that reason a number of lower courts

7

in the predatory pricing context have instead looked to

8

average variable costs or other measures as a proxy for

9

incremental costs.

So in this case

And such an incremental

But we believe that in a case such

10

as this one, looking to incremental costs may be useful

11

because it effectively excludes from the analysis any

12

potential cross-subsidization, whether by virtue of the

13

fact that in this case, for example, petitioner may have

14

harvested logs from its own lands.

15

this case that petitioner entered into various exclusive

16

dealing arrangements as well, obtained logs at a lower

17

price on that basis.

18

the virtue of focusing only on that portion of the

19

market that is the subject of the alleged predation

claims.

There are claims in

I mean, your recoupment analysis would

true, Justice Souter, and again this is an issue that

cost, but I think that the important thing to remember

with regard to the below cost pricing prong of the

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

In this Court's antitrust jurisprudence over

The same approach should apply

Brooke Group's per se rule which carved out a

justified here because raising input prices, unlike

cutting output prices, is moving prices in the wrong

direction for consumers.

5

No safe harbor per se rule is

JUSTICE BREYER:

But even it does hurt the

6

suppliers and the antitrust laws are just as, I don't

know just as, but they are just as concerned about a

group of small farmers or a group of small growers or a

group of small fishermen faced with a monopsony buyer as

they are with a group of consumers having to fight off a

MR. HAGLUND:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Justice Breyer I mean that's pretty well

established, isn't it?
MR. HAGLUND:

Well I'd like to point out

16

that the Mandeville Farms case that Mr. Pincus cited

17

does not stand for the same -

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, Congress has

19

actually passed special legislation that the Mandeville

20

Farms is consistent with the Farmers Cooperative and so

21

-- you want me to write the proposition that the

22

antitrust laws are not concerned -

23

MR. HAGLUND:

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Oh, absolutely -- with the monopoly buyer

who would in fact exploit a group of small suppliers,

MR. HAGLUND:

Absolutely not.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. HAGLUND:

Okay.

But in this particular context

5

which the Ninth Circuit repeatedly emphasized, in an

6

inelastic market like this one raising input prices is

7

not going to increase supply and -

JUSTICE BREYER:
right, can it?

That can't possibly be

I mean if in fact the object here is to

10

strike, is -- suppose their object is what you say.

11

Their object is in fact to try to get a monopoly on the

12

buying side over a group of small woodsmen.

13

might do that if they drove out all the buying

14

competitors, and now what are they going to try to do?

15

What they will try to do if they get that terrible

16

monopoly, which would be bad -

17

MR. HAGLUND:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And they

Drive prices down.
Right.

Drive prices way

19

down, below what the woodsmen could get for them.

20

if that's going to have any effect aside from an income

21

effect, it will leave some of them to go to the bread

22

line or go to other places where they have other jobs at

23

lesser revenue than they would get by staying in the

24

woods business and selling at a reasonable price.

25

would be an antitrust concern.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

And

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HAGLUND:

Absolutely, and that is

2

exactly what Weyerhaeuser's plan was here, as shown by

3

their own materials, that their plan was and in fact

4

they did foresee and project that log prices would go

5

down in 2001 -

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So where we are is at the

7

problem.

8

What we have is possibly a very bad motive and very bad

9

effects.

10

The problem is the same as at the buying side.

On the other hand, low prices are good for the

consumer.

MR. HAGLUND:

But you're not -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here we have bad effects,

13

bad possibilities.

14

good for the woodsmen.

So we need rules to separate the

15

sheep from the goats.

And the other side is proposing a

16

rule, and the rule simply is don't count this as bad

17

conduct, unless the person who pays the money for the

18

goods is in fact buying so many goods that later on when

19

he tries to sell them he will incur a loss.

On the other hand, higher prices are

Now I would have thought for 40 years that

21

was a traditional idea.

If you're trying to decide

whether people are hogging goods unnecessarily for bad

purposes, or rather storing up nuts for winter for good

I don't

And I'm not sure

Well, as to Brooke Group and

what the Court's being asked to do here, Justice Breyer,

is to go down the same path that it did in Albrecht

10

versus Harold Company in '68 when it agreed to treat

11

completely symmetrically minimum and maximum vertical

12

resale price restraints.

13

Later on, in State Oil Company vs. Kahn the

14

Court abandoned and accepted Justice Harlan's dissent

15

that it was wrong to equate those two.

they are sent by a monopsonist, like Weyerhaeuser in

7

And there was evidence in the follow-on cases that

reference that.

9

Here, however,

It was alleged in our complaint in this case

10

but not actually backed up by any testimony at trial,

11

that tree farmers in Oregon and Washington were actually

12

electing not to replant alder and as Professor Noel

notes in his law review article in the issue of the

15

-- half of this issue is devoted to this subject.

16

the sum total of literature devoted to predatory

is that where you have localized monopsony, the result

19

is when the monopsony is in full flower a misallocation

of resources between regions.

reality in this case.

MR. HAGLUND:

Well, I don't think so if you

a retired farmer, they looked at the evidence and they

closer to perfect instruction, and what should we say

must be added to it?

18

MR. HAGLUND:

It's quite simple.

If you

19

look at that paragraph, there are two pieces of it.

20

of them, one portion says that you can regard it as an

21

anticompetitive act if defendant purchased more logs

than it needed.

24

had evidence that they continued -

One

We don't think that needs to be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

40

Why is it easy to

figure out?

As Justice Breyer brought up the

2

stockpiling, how do you know whether they are storing

3

it, or a time when the supply is short, or they are just

4

letting it go to rack and moon in order to put this

5

company out of business?

6

MR. HAGLUND:

Justice Ginsburg, you will

7

know because of the evidence in the case.

If the

8

plaintiff, the defendant is able to show that they were

9

storing up this extra input against a prospect of a

10

price hike in the future or because they were out trying

11

to get enough volume for some promotion for a customer

12

that was going to significantly increase their

13

purchases, then you'd have a different kind of case.

14

have a situation where they warehoused large,

15

unprecedentedly high volumes of lumber because they -

Why did they say they

needed it?

I mean, why do you need all this Ph.D. guy

up there?

Why don't you just prove what you just said?

19

MR. HAGLUND:

We did.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

Then why do you need

21

all these other instructions about pricing?

I suppose

22

the only reason you'd need them is if there's a dispute

23

as to whether it was in their economic interest in the

24

absence of any intent to monopolize these people to buy

25

all these logs or not.

And so it would be very
41

Alderson Reporting Company

interesting if you have a way of proving that they did

not need these for any legitimate purpose, a matter

3

which is likely to be disputed.

4

thing in these cases is to prove that.

5

tell me how you prove that without giving the jury an

6

instruction something like, look to see whether they can

if they can't sell them at a profit, whether they could

on that instruction -

2

MR. HAGLUND:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- is that they can find

4

this person guilty even if all he wants to do is so

5

second-guess that market that he gets the logs and will

6

sell them at a huge profit later on in a competitive

7

selling market.

8
9

MR. HAGLUND:

We don't have a situation

here, Justice Breyer, where Weyerhaeuser presented

10

evidence that they were the most efficient and able to

11

pay higher prices.

12

quantitative evidence that it was the lowest cost

13

producer in terms of costs -

14

Weyerhaeuser presented no

these logs we later can make a profit when we resell

17

them on the competitive market.

18

they're coming up with this test is they don't think you

that you can produce a better one.

11

Bear in mind that, that at JA 901 we have a

12

Weyerhaeuser document showing that very significant

13

foreclosure from their exclusive contracts in the, in

14

Oregon for example, this is a document that shows that

15

62 percent of the market was covered through either

16

exclusive purchase arrangements between Weyerhaeuser and

large landowners, or non-efficiency-based trades were

foreclosure, linked with the anticompetitive behavior

Only 33 percent according to JA

Weyerhaeuser acquired, when it was then at a

44
Alderson Reporting Company

That kind of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

they engaged in that was a variety of bidding practices,

2

some of it was overbuying, some of it was manipulating

3

bidding back and forth, and then putting the last bid in

4

terms of that cost on the other side.

5

I think it's important, I'd like to shift to

6

the instruction again, and make the point that

7

Weyerhaeuser never gave either the plaintiff in this

8

case or the district judge the opportunity to consider a

9

different instruction than was given here.

And the fact

10

that's demonstratively shown if one looks at page 43 of

11

their opening brief in the Ninth Circuit, in the Ninth

12

Circuit they only took the position in the bulk of their

13

brief that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of

14

law on the basis of Brooke Group.

15

the contention -

16

that you couldn't have made it on Brooke Group because

they were selling these logs at a profit?

MR. HAGLUND:

I didn't quite hear that,

Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you agree that you

22

could not have prevailed under the Brooke Group test

23

because Weyerhaeuser was, was making a profit on these

24

sales even though it had bid up the price of the logs?

25

MR. HAGLUND:

We do not agree as to the
45

Alderson Reporting Company

evidence in this case.

2

that we cited to in our brief that when you adjust, as

3

against the Longview mill which our client was literally

4

right next door to, when you adjust for the fact that

5

Weyerhaeuser supplied half of the raw material needs of

6

the Longview mill at way below market transfer prices,

7

when you adjust those to the average price they paid

8

other third parties for logs, the Longview mill ran at a

loss for a significant part of the, of the predation

period.

MR. HAGLUND:

If the Court concludes the

Brooke Group applies to this case, then the instruction

was incomplete, it was not correct, and we would be

2

entitled to a remand and a chance to retry the case.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what about the

4

recoupment prong, given that Weyerhaeuser doesn't have

5

market power in the selling market and that mills were

6

entering, new mills were coming on line during this

7

period.

8
9

How would you satisfy the recoupment?
MR. HAGLUND:

the output end of things.

Well, the recoupment is not in
The recoupment is the

10

opportunity to drive log costs down to recoup the extra

11

costs you pay during the predatory period.

12

evidence in the record that a former executive from

13

Weyerhaeuser testified that they had used this strategy

14

multiple times, that when it was questioned by some in

15

top management that the head of a division would always

16

say once we either acquire or get rid of a competitor,

17

we will recoup those costs many fold.

19

in 2001 where Weyerhaeuser was showing in that

PowerPoint chart the expectation that log prices would

21

be going down in '01, '02, '03, and for every 2 percent

22

change downward it was an extra $2 million in profits to

the bottom line.

24

benefits of those lower input prices to consumers.

Obvious consumer lack of benefit in that situation.

And we had

That's at JA 260,

We also had at JA 903 a planning document

There was no plan to pass on the

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Also as to recoupment, if you look at JA 831

2

to 95, which are the year-end financials for the

3

Weyerhaeuser alder mills in Oregon, Washington and BC

4

during a roughly four-year period, you see a monu -- a

5

huge price differential between the prices in British

6

Columbia and those prevailing in Oregon and Washington.

7

We think there was every expectation on management's

8

part to drive the prices down to the levels that

9

prevailed in British Columbia, which works out to about

10

$40 million a year, way way above the amount they were

11

spending in this predatory scheme predominantly in

12

Oregon and Washington, because there is no competition

13

in British Columbia.

14

But I would like to point out that they

15

never preserved the issue of whether or not the standard

16

that the Ninth Circuit in dictum stated was as a whole

17

sufficient to guide the jury as to a definition of

18

anticompetitive conduct.

19

after quoting this paragraph they so criticize, they

20

note, although that statement of the law -- this is 43

21

of the Ninth Circuit brief, not the blue brief that you

22

have -- although that statement of the law may have been

23

acceptable when Reed Brothers was decided, it is not in

24

the wake of Brooke Group for reasons explained above.

25

The point here is that they never made any charge in the

out that they contributed to the linguistic framework of

8

this instruction in a very significant way.

9

Now we concede, if Brooke

But the

And in fact, I'd like to point

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First -

I'm losing you.

What's the

10

second point that they're trying to make besides the

11

fact that this didn't conform to Brooke Group?

12

MR. HAGLUND:

Well, they have also asserted

13

in their briefing that as an independent ground for

14

reversal, the instruction was so standardless that the

15

verdict cannot stand.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Regardless of Brooke Group.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But isn't that something

18

that we've got to consider because if, if we disagree

19

with them on Brooke Group, we've got to do it in the

20

course of making a choice between a Brooke Group

21

instruction and something else, and the only something

22

else we've got right now is what we have in this case

23

and we ought to, we ought to decide whether in fact that

24

is good enough.

25

MR. HAGLUND:

I agree with that.
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And so I mean, I think,

2

they may not have made that an independent basis of

3

reversal but we've got to consider it.

4

MR. HAGLUND:

I agree with that, but I would

5

like to point out these facts in terms of the way they

6

contributed to it.

7

just like us based upon the ABA model instructions,

8

theirs are at JA 97 to 122, that used the words outside

of this paragraph that we are talking about, fair,

Assuming they don't have a

leg to stand on in complaint, we have still got to face

what the alternative to a Brooke Group kind of

instruction is.

And -- and however they may have tried

MR. HAGLUND:

That's correct.

21

that you look to the type of formulation I gave a little

earlier where you're looking at how much did the

defendant push the market to levels that are above where

it otherwise would have been.

It's not too far from the

brief where they suggest it's, that the conduct be

2

measured by whether it raised the price that the buyer's

3

rivals had to pay for the input beyond a level that

4

could be justified or explained by other market or

5

exogenous factors and substantially affected the ability

6

of the buyer's rivals to compete for the input.

have that concern and they've offered that test that's

12

not too far from what I posited as a way to improve the

instruction that Weyerhaeuser invited.

14

I'd like to make one further point on

15

that subject and that is, if you look at the opening

statement of their counsel, the closing, he used that

2
3

MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a couple of points.

4

With respect to the story of how this

instruction came to be, in fact it closely resembles

6

some language that was requested by respondent that

7

appears on page 93A of the joint appendix which refers

8

to a test that paying a price for logs with higher than

9

market value unnecessarily to drive out or injure

10

competition.

So I do think that this is an instruction

11

that comes from respondent.

12

It's true that we did not request a Brooke

that Brooke Group didn't apply at the summary judgment

phase.

16

district judge on the grounds that it did not conform

17

with Brooke Group in order to preserve our argument here

and we believe that that objection gives the Court the

19

power to adopt an intermediate rule, but it isn't

20

exactly what we requested and there are decisions in the

21

court of appeals of to that effect.

22

We did object to the instruction proposed by the

With respect to the question about

23

purchasing more logs than they needed, as we say in our

24

briefs we think that that claim can't really be

25

separated from the predatory pricing claim here because
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the argument is that by purchasing more logs the price

2

was driven up and it's the increased price, that's the

3

impact that respondent complains of.

4

separate overbuying claim that relies on price for

5

impact would be the same thing as saying on the sell

6

side you can have an overselling claim regardless of

7

whether you flunk the Brooke Group standard with respect

8

to prices, and that's just going to undercut the

certainty that this Court has prescribed.

market might would look like if current, past purchasing

locked up and it doesn't indicate that, and in fact

there's nothing in the record to indicate what the

percentage of logs were that were available to

Weyerhaeuser by long-term contract, in contrast, as I
