ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. GORDON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Crystal Meredith wanted to do what most moms

or tipping percentages that the quota system in

20

There were seats within the school.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How does it compare with

the system that was in effect from, what was it, 1975

MR. GORDON:

I'm sorry.

It's the same

16

remedial program that -- this Court has found even in

17

Dowd that when the remedial program has achieved its

18

result we should no longer carve out that exemption

19

under the Equal Protection Clause.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think that there's

21

something of an anomaly there, that you have a system

22

that is forced on the school, that it doesn't want it,

23

works for 25 years, and then the school board doesn't

have to keep it any more, but it decides it's worked

MR. GORDON:

And in the Hampton case, which

18

I won, all right, they didn't go to any race-neutral

19

alternatives at all.

20

I'm sorry.

21

As Justice Kennedy pointed out -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Gordon, in responding

22

to Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you have to deal

23

with the fact that this Court said in the second Swann

24

case that the -- that a school district, particularly a

25

school district like Swann which had been in violation,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had been found in violation, had the same interest after

2

unitary status had been attained in maintaining the

3

unitary status as it had in reaching unitary status

4

beforehand; that if those interests are identical why

5

doesn't it follow that the means to achieve those two

6

interests, unitary status from segregation in one case,

7

preservation of unitary status in the other, are

8

reasonable if they are identical?

9

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, this

10

Court over and over again has said once a remedial plan

11

is accepted there should be race-neutral alternatives

12

under the narrow and tailored requirement.

13

school board did after I won -

14
15

JUSTICE SOUTER:
for what?

16

What this

Race-neutral alternatives

To accomplish what?
MR. GORDON:

To accomplish the same means.

17

In other words, what they could have done, as

18

Justice Kennedy pointed out, was put more magnet

19

schools, more traditional schools, have more open

20

enrollment.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Gordon, isn't it the

22

case that once you've achieved unitary status, which

23

means that the effects of past intentional

24

discrimination have been eliminated, the only way you

25

can lose unitary status is to discriminate
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

intentionally?

2
3

Isn't that right?

MR. GORDON:

Certainly.

That's the Dow

case, that says you no longer -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And isn't there a

5

distinction between unitary status and unitary

6

condition?

Unitary condition is a descriptive

7

situation.

It describes a district in which there is,

8

in fact, enough of a racial mix so that there is no

9

credible claim either that there is de facto or de jure

10

segregation; isn't that correct?

11

as unitary, a unitary condition?

12

MR. GORDON:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There is such a thing

Certainly.
And is the preservation of

14

a unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling

15

governmental objective?

16

MR. GORDON:

In Hampton, this -- our Court

17

found that it was unitary status as opposed to unitary

18

condition.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

MR. GORDON:

Uh-huh.

If you want to go with unitary

21

condition, then I still think you go back to Brown and

22

you say has it worked.

23

The friends on the other

side are arguing that there's some type of improvement

15

in educational outcome solely because you sit black

16

children next to white children.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not an improvement exactly,

18

but maybe from the Constitution's point of view.

19

Constitution wanted, as they said in the Slaughterhouse

20

cases, to take people who had formerly been slaves and

21

their children and make them full members of American

22

society.

24
25

That

And part of that was that the State couldn't

Now, the question from a constitutional
point of view that you're being asked is how could that
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Constitution which says that this is intolerable, that

2

segregated school, and insist that the school boards in

3

Swann and elsewhere take the black children and white

4

children and integrate them?

5

the day that that decree is removed tell the school

6

board it cannot make that effort any more, it can't do

7

what it's been doing, and we'll send the children back

8

to their black schools and their white schools?

9

How could the Constitution

That I take it is why the Court in Swann

10

said explicitly that you could use race as a factor in

11

the public schools when the school board so chooses.

12

Now, that's the general question that I think

13

Justice Ginsburg began and Justice Souter was following

14

it up.

15

And I would appreciate your response.
MR. GORDON:

My response is that you have

16

those series of cases that say once you've achieved the

17

unitary status, you know longer get to carve out that

18

exemption to the Fourteenth Amendment, and if we're

19

going to carve out these exemptions to the Fourteenth

20

Amendment, if we're going to say we're going to not

21

apply Gratz where it's a quota system and we are solely,

22

without any type of individual holistic review applied

23

to these kids, then there should be some improvement in

24

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How would you apply a

Alderson Reporting Company

holistic review to a kindergartner?

2

MR. GORDON:

Well, of course this system

3

didn't apply to kindergarten anyhow.

4

it's not.

5

But the answer is

You have to decide.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I can understand an

6

approach to an applicant for an elite school and so you

7

judge it on all these merit factors and other factors.

8

But for a child entering the first grade, I don't

9

understand this individualized holistic approach.

else is there other than that the child is of a certain

age and therefore will enter a certain grade?

14

GENERAL CLEMENT:

mean, I think it would depend JUSTICE STEVENS:

The only purpose is racial

integration.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

I think if you build into

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was

2

done in a way that made it express that the teachers

3

were going to be moved, that you were basically going to

4

have five and five, you were going to have a quota at

5

the two schools on the basis of race, I would say that

6

that would be unconstitutional.

7

I would think, though, that there are many

8

ways you can accomplish similar objectives without

9

making it so explicit.

And I do think that in this

10

context, I mean, there is an independent constitutional

11

value in not having these kind of express racial

12

classifications drawn.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I understand, and I'm just

14

wondering whether in your view that independent value

15

could ever be trumped by the obvious countervailing

16

value of having some African Americans see some white

17

teachers and vice versa?

18

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Oh, but I think that's the

19

point, which is that is an important objective, but I

20

have little doubt that that can be accomplished without

21

the kind of five by five quotas.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have doubt -- you have

23

little doubt.

Are you an educational expert?

I mean,

24

the -- it seems to me from what I read, that there is a

25

terrible problem in the country.

The problem is that

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there are lots and lots of school districts that are

2

becoming more and more segregated in fact, and that

3

school boards all over are struggling with this problem.

4

And if they knew an easy way, they'd do it.

5

So I don't know whether this is exactly the

6

only way to do it or not.

I do know courts are not very

7

good at figuring that out.

8

Court previously has said it is primarily up to the

9

school district.

And I guess that's why the

What's your response?

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Whatever it takes.

Justice Breyer, if I could

12

be clear, though, what I was saying in response to

13

Justice Stevens' question was really focused not on the

14

broader problem, but specifically with respect to

15

faculties.

16

the sense that I don't know of any school districts that

17

have tried to maintain the kind of express quotas in

18

teaching that he was indicating.

19

you that this problem is simple to solve.

20

tell you, though, that I think the Constitution provides

21

an answer.

22

And I think that one is a little easier in

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not here to tell
I'm here to

Just say some.

We want

23

to -- we're going to make a decision there will be some

24

white teachers and some African-American teachers in the

25

other.

And we're going to do it no matter -- if the
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Constitution permits it.

2

And that's our only motive.

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, let

3

me tell you what I certainly think they could do, which

4

is to say, look, you know, we don't have any balance in

5

these two faculties.

6

going to mix some of them up, we're going to do it in a

7

way that looks at a variety of factors, including who is

8

good with young kids, who is good with older kids.

9

What we're going to do is we're

JUSTICE STEVENS:

My example is 100 percent

10

motive to avoid 100 percent segregation.

11

GENERAL CLEMENT:

And I think if what they

12

end up doing at the end is not only a hundred percent

13

motive, but a racial classification, then I think runs

14

afoul of the Constitution.

15
16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Just some, any without

violating the Constitution.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

Just to be clear, our

18

answer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation,

19

no racial classification, is that it is still okay.

20

Now, some members of the Court may disagree with us on

21

that.

22

that great an import in practice, because although it is

23

easy to come up with the hypothetical that race is the

24

absolute and sole motivating factor, I think in this

25

context in particular, I mean, nobody -- you know,

But what I would say is it probably doesn't have

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you this, and I

2

think this applies to the case we have got, as well as

3

to Justice Stevens' hypothetical.

4

Justice Stevens' -- in answer to Justice Stevens'

5

hypothetical, that they could achieve a result,

6

legitimately achieve a result of racial mixture within

7

the respective faculties of these schools if they took

8

other things in addition to race into consideration.

9

You mentioned ability as teachers and so on.

10

You said in

But at the end of the day, the object of

11

doing this, which Justice Stevens' hypo assumed, and I

12

think the object of doing it which your answer assumed,

13

was the achievement of racial mixture in the faculties.

14

My question is:

Why do thy have to hide the

15

ball by saying, oh, we're going to consider these other

16

things, ability to teach, educational credits, whatever

17

you could come up with when at the beginning and at the

18

end, the objective is to achieve a racial mix?

19
20

Why can't they do that candidly and employ a
criterion that candidly addresses that objective?

21

GENERAL CLEMENT:

22

there are several responses.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, Justice Souter,
One is that the

concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to

2

hurt or to stigmatize.

3

going on as between black and white, when we say there

4

is a value in mixing them up.

5
6
7

Here, there is stigmatization

Therefore, why should that same concern
about referring to race at all be applied in this case.
GENERAL CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Souter, you

8

may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it

9

was clear there was stigma going on, but you have

10

extended it in Croson and in Adarand across the board.

11

And I have to say -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We have extended it in

13

cases in which benefits were being denied.

14

Justice Stevens' hypothetical, and so far as I know in

15

the kindergarten system in these cases, no educational

16

benefit was being denied.

17

GENERAL CLEMENT:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -

But that is simply another

24

way -- when you say it is the choice that's being

25

denied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that is simply another way of saying you may never use

2

the means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the

3

educational objective.

4

a different way.

5

You're saying the same thing in

GENERAL CLEMENT:

That may be,

6

Justice Souter.

But what I guess I would say is the

7

logic of your argument would certainly require

8

reconsideration of the Gratz case.

9

that context thought that individualized consideration

And this Court in

10

even if it was going to be very difficult in the context

11

of the University of Michigan's 25,000 admissions to the

12

undergraduate program, this Court said individualized

13

consideration was part of the constitutional guarantee.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In Gratz, the

15

characteristics of individuals that could be considered

16

were arguably relevant to a distribution decision.

17

Here, the sole point is not to achieve a quota by

18

relaxing other standards.

19

a value which comes from mixing the races, from

20

distribution.

21

The whole point is to achieve

And, therefore, why is it appropriate to

22

look to other things as opposed to looking at that

23

candidly, if that is a legitimate objective?

GENERAL CLEMENT:

the lesson of history in this area is that racial

classifications are not ones where we should just let

that's what -- you know, Justice Kennedy made the point

5

in his opinion in Grutter that the problem with

6

approving the first blunderbuss opportunity that you see

to use race in a context is that then you deprive the

courts of any role trying to refine matters, and seeing,

What about the other part?

Because I think the Solicitor General -- I hope, I don't

that Brown held out the promise of an equal education,

6

that the country worked for 35 or 40 years to try to get

a degree of integration, and that maintaining it is

important.

MR. MELLEN:

Magnet schools, Your Honor.

And with respect to history, Your Honor, it is somewhat

complex, because although the Court ruled in the Hampton

case in 2000 that the degree was dissolved then, the

17

board honestly felt beginning in 1981 that the decree

18

had been dissolved.

19

to the plan.

And so the board in 1984, 1991,

to introduce more choice into the system including

that the use of race in this plan is self-limiting in

6

Jefferson County continues to decline, which it has

believe that the presence of racially integrated schools

during that period contributed to that -- there are

stereotypes and promoting better cross-racial

understanding throughout the community, we can foresee a
