Mr. Farr.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor

12

Standards Act, Congress made one thing very clear, that

13

it wanted the Department of Labor to define the

14

boundaries and fill in the details of the companionship

15

services exemption.

16

implications for this case.

And I think that has two important

17

First of all, when the Department has filled

18

in the details, after notice and comment rulemaking, its

19

regulations should receive Chevron deference as long as

20

they are permissible implementation of the statute.

21

Second, and particularly specific to this

22

case, if there are ambiguities in the regulations, or as

23

we have here, an apparent facial inconsistency, the

24

court should accept the Secretary's resolution of that

25

ambiguity provided that it is a reasonable one.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

here we submit it's not only a reasonable one, it is by

2

far the most sensible one.

3

Now I'd actually like to turn, if I may, to

4

the second issue first, because I think that's the

5

source of a lot of the concern in this case.

6

Plainly the two regulations, section 10 -

7

552.109(a), which is the regulation directly at issue

8

before this Court, and 552.3, which is the regulation

9

relied on heavily by the Second Circuit to strike down

10

the present regulation, have some inconsistency between

11

them.

12

But it is also plain that the Department

13

could not have intended to say at one and the same time

14

that the only employers entitled use the exemption were

15

homeowners and then say in another section promulgated

16

at the same time that also third-party employers are

17

entitled to the exemption.

18

one resolve this apparent inconsistency?

19

So the question is, how does

And the Secretary says, well, the only

20

regulation that we promulgated that, in fact, deals

21

specifically with the issue of third-party employment is

22

552.109(a), which is in fact headed Third-Party

23

Employment.

24
25

And that section 552.3, while containing
some language that might be read to address that issue,
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in fact deals with several other topics.

2

it deals with the topic of what kinds of jobs are

3

involved in domestic service, maids, chauffeurs,

4

footmen, et cetera; where those have to be performed, in

5

a private home; and in fact, somewhat more than that, in

6

the private home of the person receiving the services.

7

Specifically

So it's not enough, for example, for

8

somebody to conduct a service like laundry or baby

9

sitting in his or her own house, it has to be in the

10
11

house of the person receiving the services.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the words were

12

home of the person who employs, not who receives the

13

services but who employs.

14

MR. FARR:

Oh, that's correct,

15

Justice Ginsburg.

16

specifically what I was saying.

17

is the Secretary's attempt to resolve what is an

18

apparent inconsistency between the literal language in

19

552.3 and the literal language of section 552.109(a).

20
21
22

The literal language is not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What I'm talking about

By -- reading out the

words "of the person who employs" her?
MR. FARR:

Well, essentially reading them to

23

say they, they were not intended to address directly the

24

subject of third party employment which is the subject

25

addressed in 109(a).

And I think if one is -- even
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

leaving aside the question of deference to the Secretary

2

for a moment, Justice Ginsburg, if one is simply talking

3

about making a fair resolution of these conflicting

4

provisions from the ground up, it seems to me the first

5

thing that one would do is apply the canon that the

6

specific provision controls the general.

7

And if one looks at the two provisions,

8

section 109(a) is a provision that deals with one thing

9

and one thing only:

10

that is third party employment.

And it says explicitly and straight out that

11

persons who are employed by third-party employers are -

12

or third-party employers who employ persons performing

13

domestic services are entitled to the exemption.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought it also

15

addressed, unlike the more general regulation, just

16

people who have companionship services.

17

a maid or a cook or a footman, who doesn't provide

18

companionship, then 109 is inapplicable.

19
20
21
22

MR. FARR:

So if you have

That would be true.

Now that

would be inapplicable JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's a footman?

I don't

even know what a footman is.

23

(Laughter.)

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. FARR:

What is a footman?

I think that may be beyond my
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

expertise, Justice Scalia.

2

The -- of course that doesn't address

3

anything beyond companionship services, of course,

4

because there is not an exemption beyond that.

5

that's one of the interesting things about 552.3.

6

addition to generally dealing with this question of what

7

kind of jobs are domestic service, it is, in fact, going

8

well beyond anything that is necessary to a discussion

9

of the exemption for companionship services, because

And
In

10

jobs like chauffeurs, and maids, and all of that are not

11

subject to the exemption.

12

552.3 is doing despite the couple of words that -- at

13

the beginning of it, is giving a general definition of

14

what constitutes domestic employment, what constitutes

15

domestic services for purposes not only of the exemption

16

but, in fact, really for the purposes of coverage as

17

well.

18

So it really looking at what

And the Department has taken that position.

19

It says this is, in fact, the only definition of

20

domestic service that we have in the regulations, and it

21

is not just intended to be limited to the particular

22

situation of the exemption.

23

than that to coverage as well.

24
25

It applies more broadly

So I think in all those senses,
Justice Kennedy, 109 is a very specific provision, 552.3
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

deals with a number of other subjects.
Now, one other thing on the statutory

3

interpretation part is that the reading of 552.3 that

4

Respondent offers also leads to the problem that

5

essentially sets up a tension with another one of the

6

regulations which is 552.101(a).

7

sorry -- I don't have the right page number here -- it

8

is on page 77a of the appendix to the petition -- has,

9

carries over the language from 552.3 about in the home

552.101(a) which I'm

10

of the employer that Justice Ginsburg referred to.

11

then it also says that this includes people who are

12

commonly referred to as private household workers.

13

But

And the one thing we know from the

14

Department of Labor submissions to Congress in 1974 and

15

also from what the Department has said before this Court

16

is that that term at the time was defined by the

17

Department and known by Congress to constitute more than

18

just employees employed by the homeowner.

19

special second category for people who worked in the

20

home of the homeowner at the homeowner's request but

21

were employed by a third party agency.

22

There was a

Now somewhere underlying all of this

23

question, I think, is statutory interpretation and

24

indeed all of Respondent's arguments against deference

25

to the Department is a basic underlying premise, which
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is that Congress really would not have wanted, even if

2

it didn't say so, for the exemption to apply to

3

employees who work for third parties.

4

And I would just like to suggest that there

5

really is no basis for thinking that Congress would have

6

wanted that.

7

First of all, third participate employers

8

such as private agencies provide services for the

9

particular group of people which Congress was trying to

10

assist with this exemption.

11

or disability are unable to care for themselves.

12

Agencies acting as the employers specifically can do the

13

hiring, they can do the vetting and the screening, the

14

background screening for employees.

15

necessary paperwork, filing Social Security documents

16

and things like that.

17

People who by reason of age

They can provide

So, in fact, for Congress to have some sort

18

of bias against covered enterprises seems a little bit

19

unusual.

20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Farr, I'm not sure I

followed your argument with regard to 552,101(a).

22

MR. FARR:

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

But what is your argument there?

25

Uh-huh.

Yes, Your Honor.

Page 77a as you said.
I mean,

that seems to, that seems to reinforce the provision
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you say we should ignore or at least should accept

2

the Secretary's reinterpretation of.

3

MR. FARR:

Well perhaps, perhaps I wasn't as

4

clear as I intended to be.

It does, as I indicated,

5

have the language about the private home of the

6

employer.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. FARR:

9

That's right.

However, the -- the preceding

sentence says the term, referring to the term that is at

10

issue in 552.3, domestic service employment, includes

11

persons who are frequently referred to as private

12

household workers.

13

statements are inconsistent with each other.

14

cannot be limited to employees of the home owner and

15

also include persons who are frequently referred to as

16

private household workers, at least if one means all the

17

persons referred to -

18

The fact is that those two

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yeah.

I see.

The term

Is that

19

clear in the -- in the specific Senate report that is

20

referred to here?

21
22
23

MR. FARR:

In the specific Senate report, in

both the '73 and the '74 reports JUSTICE SCALIA:

This, the one that's cited

24

in the regulation itself.

Because I -- otherwise, I

25

don't, I ignore those things.

That's cited in the

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

regulation.

2

Does that report say it?
MR. FARR:

What?

The report uses the term

3

private households workers frequently interchangeably

4

with the term domestic employees.

5

from the report itself.

6

That is what is clear

Now, the Department of Labor when it was

7

reporting to Congress, as Congress has required it to

8

do, the Department of Labor used the term private

9

households workers, specifically defined in there by the

10

Department, to say this means not just employees

11

employed by the homeowner but also people who are

12

employed by third parties.

13

So I think it is a fair assumption that when

14

the Senate report was using that phrase, it was using it

15

in the same manner that the Department of Labor reports

16

have.

17

further backward in the legislative history, Senator

18

Dominick actually quoted that language, the definition

19

from the Department of Labor, on the Senate floor during

20

the debates.

21

And, in fact, at one point in the -- moving

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

22

Department of Labor's first take on this was that the

23

exemption did not apply to third-party employers.

24

was the original Department of Labor position, wasn't

25

it?

Alderson Reporting Company

That

MR. FARR:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

I believe

that's correct.

3

Department in November of 1975 -- this is an opinion

4

letter that's cited at page 21 of the Solicitor

5

General's brief -- which specifically stated that the

6

exemption applied whether the employee was an employee

7

of the homeowner or of a public or private -

8
9

There was a, an opinion letter from the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm referring to the

notice and comment rulemaking in which you place great

10

stock.

I thought the original notice and comment

11

rulemaking said the exemption does not apply to

12

third-party employers.

13

MR. FARR:

I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.

I

14

misunderstood the time frame we were dealing with.

15

the notice of proposed rulemaking, actually I would

16

disagree with that characterization also.

17

proposed rulemaking made a division among third-party

18

employers.

19

to those third-party employers who were covered

20

enterprises but it would be available to those who were

21

not covered enterprises.

22

Well, that it solicited comments

7

on that proposal.

its position to say no, in fact, all third-party

9

employers will be exempt.

10

And after the comments, it changed

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -- and there was no

11

further discussion of it after -- after it sent out the

12

notice of proposed ruling that said third party

13

employees will not be exempt, and then it said they will

14

be exempt, did it give reasons for the change?

Yes, if I can just -- if I can

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Farr, would you agree

7

that the position expressed in the notice itself would

have -- in the original notice would have been

9

consistent with the statutory language?

10

MR. FARR:

I'm not sure of that,

11

Justice Stevens, to be honest with you.

12

the difficulties here in answering that is that I think,

13

because the Department has such broad authority under

14

213(a)(15) to define and delimit the term, I think

15

what's consistent with the statute has expanded

16

somewhat.

17

I mean one of

On the other hand, I have to say I don't

18

really see where there would be in the language of the

19

statute any basis for drawing a distinction between

20

different kinds of third-party employers.

21

phraseology in the coverage provisions, the phraseology

22

in the exemption provisions, really doesn't allow for

23

that in terms of any sort of statutory interpretation.

MR. FARR:

I mean, it's possible, but as I

2

say, the -- I mean, among the difficulties that covered

enterprises is not just corporations and big and small

4

5

includes state and local governments.

6

would have been addressing here, if it had been squarely

7

facing the issue, would have not just been the question

of how to treat large and small corporations, but

think it would be a little bit unusual for Congress, who

is reasonably solicitous of state interests, to deny

If you're referring to the initial proposed

22

reading of the exemption given the fact that the

25

that exemption that precludes the construction that's

2

consistent with that language.

3

In fact, we think it is the most

The language of 5523 upon which Respondent

4

relies does not change that conclusion.

5

in isolation that language could require that domestic

6

service employees have to provide their services in the

be given that reading for the reasons explained in the

Department's 2005 advisory memorandum.

10

While if read

The Department's construction of its own

11

regulations contained in that memorandum is itself

12

entitled to deference under Our and Seminole Rock and

13

its construction harmonizes the various provisions at

14

issue here far better than Respondent's reading of 553

15

does.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The statute treats

17

together babysitters and elder care people, but I take

18

it the babysitters if they were working for an agency

19

rather than for the householders, there wouldn't be any

20

exemption?

21

Is that right?
MR. SALMONS:

That's correct, and that's

22

tied to a specific term that only applies to the

23

exemption as to babysitters.

24

exempt with regard to babysitters is babysitting on a

25

casual basis.

The only thing that's

Congress certainly could have included a
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

casual basis requirement with regard to the exemption

2

for companionship services.

3

that it did not and we read from that that Congress

4

wanted all domestic service employees providing

5

companionship services to be exempt, and we think that's

6

most consistent with the goal of ensuring that those

7

individuals who most need this type of care have the

8

opportunity to receive them at a reasonable cost.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We think it's very notable

Isn't it odd that this -

10

the basic thing about the '74 legislation, it was going

11

to add to the Fair Labor Standards Act people who were

12

not covered before.

13

yet you say that, while Congress had its mind trained on

14

adding people, it also subtracted people who were

15

covered before, took them out, removed them from the

16

coverage of the Act.

17

So it added household workers.

MR. SALMONS:

And

Well, we think that that is

18

the consequence of the companionship services exemption,

19

but we don't think that's odd based on the Department of

20

Labor's view of what the purpose of that exemption is

21

and based on the textual difference between, for

22

example, the exemption for baby sitting services and the

23

exemption for companionship services.

24
25

The exemption here expresses no limitation
based on the identity of the employer and we think it

was well within the agency's discretion to conclude that

2

what Congress had in mind here was a categorical

3

exemption based on the type of services that are being

4

provided; and while that may mean that there are certain

5

workers who are now exempt who were not previously

6

exempt, that's because Congress for the first time in

7

1974 focused on this problem of companionship services

8

being provided to those who cannot care for themselves;

9

and we think that follows from the text, and for the

10
11

reasons Congress adopted that.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Salmons, can I ask you

12

a question about the importance of the whole litigation.

13

Am I correct in believing that there's a provision in

14

the law that protects the defendants from damages

15

liability if they relied in good faith on the

16

regulation, so that what we're really talking about is

17

whether the regulation would apply in the future rather

18

than there being a damage issue in the case?

19

MR. SALMONS:

Well, there is a safe harbor

provision that allows for reliance by employers on a

21

statement by the agency.

would point to the language of 552.3.

2

example, how the Second Circuit would have resolved that

3

question, given the way it viewed the statute here.

4

we do think that that would apply and so I think one

5

view of that would be it's largely prospective.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not sure, for

But

So in your view we're

7

really faced with a question of whether the regulation

8

should be given prospective effect.

9

MR. SALMONS:

10

I'm sorry?

What would be

given prospective effect?

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

As to whether the

12

Government's position should be given prospective effect

13

because the past liability doesn't -- the damage

14

liability just doesn't exist.

15

MR. SALMONS:

Well, that is our view.

16

Again, I think that would be an issue that would be

17

litigated and I'm sure litigated heavily in the hundreds

18

of cases that are being filed under this provision.

19

I think it's -- one of the concerns I think of the

20

agency here was to provide a clear statement with regard

21

to how these seemingly conflicting provisions of the

22

regulation are to be reconciled and applied.

issue with that.

I think that there are a variety of

things that point to the conclusion that the language in

552.3 that refers to "in the home of the employer"

simply cannot be read literally.

5

the Social Security context and if read the way

6

Respondents do we think would raise a serious question

7

about the scope of coverage because the agency has

always viewed 552.3, notwithstanding the initial line

that says "For purposes of the exemption," to provide

It was borrowed from

10

the relevant definition for coverage as well.

And no

11

party, or amici for that matter, before this Court nor

12

the Department thinks that there's a difference between

13

the identity of the employer for purposes of coverage.

14

And we also think, given the language in 101 that refers

15

to private household workers, the definition of which

16

was provided to Congress in a report by the Department

17

of Labor and is relied upon in the advisory memorandum

18

in 2005, which clearly applies to third party employers,

19

suggests that 553 cannot be read literally.

20

And of course we know that at the same time

21

that the agency adopted 552.3 it felt the need to adopt

22

a specific regulation dealing with the question of

23

third-party employment which would not be relevant -

24

which would not be necessary under Respondent's reading.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD C. BECKER

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6

8
9

MR. BECKER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
On October 1, 1974, just five months after
the 1974 amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act took

10

effect, the Department of Labor exercised its delegated

11

law-making function to define this term "domestic

12

service employment," which exists in the companionship

13

exemption and nowhere else in the amendments.

14

defined its clearly and explicitly to apply only to

15

companions and baby sitters employed by the household.

16

And they

At the same time, DOL provided a persuasive

17

explanation for that definition.

The Department found

18

that such companions and baby sitters when employed by

19

covered enterprises had been covered prior to the

20

amendments and that it could not have been Congress'

21

purpose, when amendments were explicitly designed to

22

extend coverage, to at the same time contract coverage.

23

The very preamble to the Act states that the purposes of

24

the amendments are to expand the coverage of the Act.

25

Therefore, the DOL itself concluded in October of 1974
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that it was not the purpose of those amendments to deny

2

the Act's protection to previously covered domestic

3

service employees.

4

The definition in 552.3, which expressly

5

applies only to the exemption, conflicts directly with

6

the final third-party regulation.

Let's imagine -- it sounds like a

I mean, why

There are lots of specific

If I read that, I would have thought, well,

MR. BECKER:

Your Honor, the definitional

23

regulation, 552.3, explicitly defines a term used only

24

in the companionship services exemption, "domestic

25

service employment."

And it defines it clearly and
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

explicitly to apply only to employment by the household.
Therefore, there is a direct conflict with

3

the so-called third party employer regulation, which

4

appears to say that the exemption can apply to employees

5

employed by third parties.

6

The importance of the conflict is twofold.

7

One, when the original regulation was proposed the

8

Department provided a persuasive explanation.

9

surely didn't intend to contract coverage in amendments

10

designed explicitly to expand coverage.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Congress

Did Congress intend to

12

cover, which I guess is a growing situation, that there

13

is an old woman or man and they're very sick and they

14

live in their house, there's only one way to keep them

15

from having to go to an institution.

Their children

16

hire a companion to look after them.

Now, that's a

17

third party.

18

MR. BECKER:

Your Honor, that question has

19

been posed by some of the amici and it is a good

20

question, but not the question before you.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. BECKER:

Because?

And I submit that if the

23

Department construed section 552.3 to say when our words

24

say "employed by the household" that could include a

25

broader notion of the household, for example a son or
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

daughter living outside the household, that might be a

2

permissible construction of the Department's own

3

regulation.

those words -

5

But the construction which simply takes

she is employed.

12

13

this, obviously -- however -- and I think it's probably

14

very common, that all over the country it's the family,

15

the children, the grandchildren, an aunt, an uncle,

16

maybe a good friend, maybe they're not even related, who

17

is paying for a companion for an old, sick person so

18

they don't have to be brought to an institution.

19

So if we're being literal and if you

And if you win this case, it seems to me

20

suddenly there will be millions of people who will be

21

unable to do it and, hence, millions of sick people who

22

will move to institutions.

23

that isn't totally a legal point, it is of course a

24

legal point because it's a question of what people

25

intended, but a worrisome point, I would be telling the

Now, if I were to say that

Alderson Reporting Company

truth.

2

It is a very worrisome point.
MR. BECKER:

It's a very important question

3

of public policy and therefore let me answer in two

4

ways.

5

under the existing regulations to address that concern.

6

The elderly individual that you're concerned about who

7

is severely disabled and thus needs this care, the child

8

or family member who is employing the companion to care

9

for them could do so as their guardian, and therefore as

One, I think there is a proper procedure even

10

a technical legal matter would be doing so, the

11

employment would be by the person who resides in the

12

home.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It wouldn't take a whole lot

14

of imagination for Justice Breyer to give the money to

15

his mother, who could then hire.

16

MR. BECKER:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

Exactly.
I mean, a clever lawyer

would think of that, I think.

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. BECKER:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A clever lawyer could do this.
And perhaps there are

22

people, lawyers in the Government, who try to see

23

through that kind of thing.

24

MR. BECKER:

But let me answer the second -

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And there are many -- maybe

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Scalia has the answer.

2

MR. BECKER:

Let me answer a second way to

3

what is a serious concern.

And the second way the

4

situation could be dealt with is by the Department of

5

Labor.

6

the industry has changed and therefore, in a way which

7

could certainly be consistent with Congress's intent

8

because it would not be withdrawing coverage from a

9

previously covered employee who was employed by an

They could look at their regulations and say,

10

enterprise, we could say that the exemption applies to

11

companions and baby sitters employed by private

12

individuals, including the homeowner, the son or

13

daughter, etcetera.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You're saying it's

15

permissible to change the rules because the industry has

16

changed.

17

at about the time the statute was enacted?

18

prevalence of third-party employers is something that

19

really developed later?

20

MR. BECKER:

21

clearly the case, Justice Stevens.

22

several things about Congress in 1974.

23

enterprise coverage was relatively new.

24

in 1961, expanded it in 1966, and indeed expanded these

25

very amendments in 1974.

Is it not possible that the industry changed
That the

As an empirical matter, that is
However, we know
We know that the
They adopted it

So Congress was aware of the
29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prior coverage.

We know that the Department of Labor,

2

in the very reports which have been cited by the

3

petitioner, stated both in January of 1973 and in

4

January of 1974 in their reports to Congress on the Act,

5

stated that there was prior coverage of domestics

6

employed by third parties.

7

enforcement activity by the Department of Labor against

8

such third-party employers.

We know there was

9

So while the industry has certainly changed,

10

there were enterprises who employed domestics, including

11

companions, in 1974, and Congress was aware of it and

12

stated over and over again in the preamble, in the

13

committee reports, which indeed, the House committee

14

report said, "Our intention is to expand the act to the

15

extent of Federal power."

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- putting aside

17

-- putting 552.109 aside, how is 552.3 a plausible

18

interpretation of the statute?

19
20
21

MR. BECKER:

Your Honor, we think it is the

most plausible interpretation for the following reasons:
Number one, contrary to what has been

22

suggested, the language in the exemption is not

23

identical to the language in the extension provision

24

extending the minimum wage and overtime requirements.

25

There is an important difference, and that difference is
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the word employment.

Now that's important for several

2

reasons.

3

to be read broadly and exemptions narrowly.

4

an additional word that can and would suggest it should

5

be read as a term of limitation.

Number one, of course, coverage provisions are

6

So there's

Number two, that difference must be given

7

significance, if possible.

8

to mean the same as the coverage provisions when it

9

doesn't exist in the coverage provisions.

10

The word should not be read

And number three, we should avoid

11

redundancy.

There is a reading of that unique language,

12

"domestic service employment", which makes sense and in

13

fact, is exactly the reading given by the Department.

14

Congress did not intend to -

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What employment

16

would someone who's hired by a third party be engaged in

17

if not domestic service employment?

18

MR. BECKER:

The word domestic service

19

employment is not necessary to describe what you

20

described, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

Congress intended to describe, it could have said simply

22

an employee employed to provide companionship services.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that is what the

Well, it could have said a

24

lot of things.

But I find it -- you're hanging your

25

case upon the proposition that there is a difference
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

between domestic service employment and employed in

2

domestic service employment.

3

Wow.

You know, I just don't see how there's

4

any difference in those two at all.

5

MR. BECKER:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor You're saying we have to

7

find some difference no matter how imaginative the

8

difference might be.

9

not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.

10

If there were a difference, I'm

MR. BECKER:

What I'm suggesting is not that

11

our case relies or hangs on that word.

12

suggesting is if that word, that phrase, "domestic

13

service employment", is given the definition which the

14

Department of Labor itself gave it, it avoids reading

15

two phrases which are different to mean the same thing.

16

It avoids redundancy.

17

consistent with every other piece of evidence we have

18

about Congress's intent.

19

What I'm

And moreover, it is wholly

Even the Department of Labor suggested it

20

surely could not have been Congress's intent to retract

21

coverage.

22

The definition is consistent with that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can I ask you what your

23

proposal is with regard to the contradictory

24

regulations, 552.3 and 552. -- what is it, 109?

25

I think they are contradictory.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, the Agency has come up with a solution.

2

We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to

3

mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but -

4

you know -- close enough for government work.

5
6

What is your solution for solving the
inconsistency?

7

Are both of the regulations bad?

MR. BECKER:

My solution, Your Honor, has

8

two parts but leads to the same conclusion.

Our

9

solution is that in applying the Act, which is the

10

question here, does the Act apply to Ms. Coke's

11

employment, this Court should apply the definitional

12

regulations for two reasons, the definitional regulation

13

for two reasons.

14

one disputes, and was promulgated in the exercise of the

15

Department's law making function.

16

expressly defined and delimited its term "domestic

17

service employment" in 552.3 and expressly said it was

18

not doing so in the third-party regulation.

19

entitled to greater deference for that reason.

20

moreover -

One, it is the regulation, which no

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. BECKER:

The Department

So it's
But

What's your other reason?

It is the only definition which

23

makes sense, which doesn't lead to a whole series of

24

problems.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because of employed and

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

domestic employment versus -

2

MR. BECKER:

For -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. BECKER:

-- domestic service?

For the following five reasons,

5

Your Honor.

One, it avoids reading a term in the

6

statute, not only a term in the regulation but a term in

7

the statute, completely out of the statute.

8

the term "employment".

And that is

9

Secondly, as the Department found, it is

10

consistent with what was Congress's clear intent, to

11

expand and not to contract coverage.

12

Thirdly, if one looks at the debates, and

13

there was extensive and vigorous debate about these

14

amendments, the exclusive focus in Congress was the

15

household.

16

with the extension of coverage to the households.

17

applying the exemption to protect only household

18

employees is wholly consistent with what was Congress's

19

exclusive -

20

The opponents were exclusively concerned

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So

Well, you're getting into

21

arguments now that are not about the regulation but

22

they're about the statute.

23

regulations that are entitled to deference.

24

have two regulations that are conflicting.

25

you decide which one prevails?

I'm assuming that we have

9

why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?

10

The agency is given great deference in the

MR. BECKER:

And even if the

Your Honor, of course setting

11

aside, as you do, our argument that Congress has

12

specific intent on this question, looking only at the

13

regulation -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's statutory.

I just

15

want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the

16

statutory -

17

MR. BECKER:

Let me answer in several ways.

18

First, this Court has clearly held that an agency does

19

not have unbounded discretion to construe its own

20

regulations.

21

unambiguous, they cannot be construed away.

When the terms of the regulations are
Now here -

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They aren't unambiguous.

23

They contradict each other.

24

something about it, and here the agency made a choice.

25

Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to

The agency has to do

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words,

2

they were the mistake.

3

mistake.

4

take their word on it?

One or the other had to be the

We decided it was this one.

5

MR. BECKER:

Why shouldn't we

Again, for two reasons, Your

6

Honor.

There's a difference between conflict and

7

ambiguity.

8

simply the -- there's two sets of words which they

9

attempt to read out of the regulation, one of the

The words are unambiguous, and it's not

10

unambiguous words that require employment by the person

11

who's living in the home, and the other is the prefatory

12

language which says the regulation only applies to the

13

exemption.

14

General and the petitioners actually suggest to this

15

Court that it should take apart the regulation and

16

ignore two of its three operative provisions.

17

So in the guise of deference, the Solicitor

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if they're flatly

18

contradictory, doesn't your argument have to be that

19

.109(a) has lesser status?

20

to, isn't it?

21

MR. BECKER:

That's what it boils down

That is certainly my primary

22

argument, that this statute is relatively unique in that

23

it vested two very different sorts of authority in the

24

Department of Labor, one a clear law making authority to

25

actually define and delimit, to specify what the terms
36
Alderson Reporting Company

in the law mean -

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm talking about what you

think the Department of Labor was doing when it

promulgated 109(a).

6

that has the force and effect of law, and we're going to

7

go through the procedure that would be necessary to

issue such a regulation.

9

power here because we want this interpretation which we

It was thinking in effect the

We have the power to issue a regulation here

But we're not invoking that

10

think is the correct interpretation of the statute not

11

to be followed -- not to get as much deference from the

12

courts as it would if we were invoking our power.

13

Does that make any sense?

14
15

That an agency

would proceed in that way?
MR. BECKER:

Your Honor, it not only makes

16

sense, it's been the Department's pattern since the Act

17

was adopted.

18

adopted has split its regulations into those under the

19

exemptions -- for example the primary exemption for

20

professional, executive and administrative employees -

21

has split its regulations under those exemptions into

22

those which define and delimit, into those which do not

23

define and delimit, or other general statements that

24

apply to their interpretation.

25

That is, the Department since the Act was

they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking.

about interpretive regulations.

6

of the significant regulations of the most important

7

agencies are interpretive regulations.

8

MR. BECKER:

You

In fact, probably most

The important difference here,

Justice Scalia, is the statute.

The statute, like the

10

tax statute which was interpreted by this Court in Vogel

11

and Rowan, creates two types of authority.

12

under the Fair Labor Standards Act, but -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And not only

I understand that you say

14

it creates two types, but there is no indication that it

15

intended one type of authority to be entitled to less

16

respect from the courts than the other.

17

rely on for that?

18

MR. BECKER:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What do you

Your Honor Where is the proposition

20

that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a

21

full-fledged binding regulation?

22

MR. BECKER:

Well, let me qualify the

23

question, if I might.

The Petitioner would suggest that

24

we're relying on simply a label, this is in the

25

interpretive section and the other is in the general

regulation section.

2

very clear statement both in the regulations, 552.2(c),

3

as well as in both the proposed regulations and the

4

final regulations, which clearly state that only those

5

in Part A define and delimit.

6

distinction?

7

Congress clearly meant these two grants to be different.

8

Otherwise, why would it have granted an express power to

9

define and delimit which would otherwise be redundant of

10
11

Far from it.

We are relying on a

Why is that an important

It's an important distinction because

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They're different but not

12

necessarily of different -- entitled to different

13

respect from the courts.

14

define and delimit?

15

even purport to be an interpretation of any language in

16

the statute, but the use of authority given to the

17

agency to cut out certain areas, to say the -- this rule

18

won't apply to companies over this -- that can't

19

possibly be an interpretation of the statute.

20

A defined -- what is it,

These are regulations that don't

So Congress says we're going to give the

21

agency that authority.

22

going to give this agency the authority that every other

23

agency has, which is to interpret -- interpret the

24

language of the statute.

25

MR. BECKER:

In addition, of course, we're

Well, Your Honor, I think we
39

can safely assume in 1974 when Congress created these

2

two types of authority, it did so with knowledge of the

3

law.

Addison to its decision in Skidmore, clearly itself

5

distinguished between the exercise of those two

6

different interpretive or rulemaking authority.

7

in Addison, construing a very similar term in a

8

different exemption, giving the Department of Labor the

9

power to define a particular term in the exemption, said

And this Court, if you compare its decision in

Clearly

10

that is law making authority.

11

the Department of Labor says unless it's clearly

12

inconsistent with the statutory -- with Congress's

13

intent.

14

And we will follow what

In Skidmore, where that type of expressed

15

delegated law making authority to define and delimit was

16

not at issue, the Court said we will record only that

17

degree of deference to which the regulation -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Skidmore was before a

19

rather significant case called Chevron.

20

MR. BECKER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

21

was also before the 1974 amendment.

22

is, what was Congress intending in creating two types of

23

rulemaking authority, the power to define and delimit,

24

and the general rulemaking authority, I think we need to

25

consider Congress's intent at that time.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

But it

So if the question

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You mean we're going to

2

divide all administrative law now into those -- those

3

regulations -- those provisions that were adopted by

4

Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress

5

post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're

6

going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by

7

the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the

8

ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently.

9

Do you have any case of ours that suggests something

10

like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of

proceeding?

Let me answer in two ways, Your

particular statutory scheme that is contrary to -

15

One, it would not be any case.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Here we have a

Ought not to get as

much deference from the courts.

17

MR. BECKER:

Here we have a case essentially

18

described by Justice Kennedy in & Haga, where we have a

19

different statutory scheme combined with a explicit

20

statement by the Agency as to which part of that scheme

the Agency is operating under.

cite, or the cases would be Rolo and Rove which have not

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the case I would

Since we're into that,

we're into this fascinating subject, I thought that
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possibly they had -- they promulgated the whole thing

2

pursuant to the rulemaking power under that particular

3

statute, because that's what it says in 552.2.

4

"this part" -- it doesn't say subpart, it says part -

and part is 552.

in the part.

mean interpretive rules, because when you look at those

8

interpretations, they have a whole lot of numbers in

them, and divide by 32.

It says

And both regs we are talking about are

And B says interpretations, but they don't

Nobody thinks that Congress

10

meant in this statute divide by 32, as opposed by divide

11

by 33.

12

So as I read that, I thought the whole thing

13

is promulgated pursuant to their rulemaking authority;

14

Part A has more general things.

15

specific things.

16

Part B has more

Where am I wrong?

MR. BECKER:

Well, I think the question,

17

Your Honor, is which of the regulations were promulgated

18

pursuant to the specific authority -

19
20

JUSTICE BREYER:

All of them.

All of them

is what it says unless I missed something.

21

MR. BECKER:

Well, I think what you missed

22

is that a simple citation to the exemption does not

23

translate into an exercise of the power to define and

24

delimit.

25

as to when it was exercising that power.

Because the Department was very, very specific

42
Alderson Reporting Company

In 552.2(c) it

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

says the definitions required by the legislation are

2

provided in the following sections and it enumerates

3

them and does not include the third-party regulation.

4

Now Petitioners would suggest well, that's

5

just a definition.

6

However, both the notice of proposed rulemaking and the

7

notice of final rulemaking said that we are exercising

8

our power to define and delimit in subpart A.

9

They also have the power to delimit.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

10

MR. BECKER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I got the point.

But part B is different.
Right.

Right.
So why are you sure

13

there's a conflict in the first place?

14

says that the term domestic service employment refers to

15

services performed in the home of the employer.

16

doesn't say it only refers to that.

17

down and 109 says it also includes employees who are

18

employed by a third party.

19
20
21
22
23

You know, 552.3

It

And then you go

I mean, can't they be reconciled in that
way.
MR. BECKER:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

And its certainly not the way that the CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

Agency has done it.

25

to them, anyway.

It's not the way the

But you don't think we should defer

So 43
Alderson Reporting Company

(Laughter.)

2

MR. BECKER:

That's correct.

But the

3

regulation -- 552.3 defines the statutory term which

4

only exists in the exemption, domestic service

5

employment.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but it says it

7

refers to something.

8

regulations and statutes do, is, you know, it is defined

9

as.

10

It doesn't say as many of these

And particularly when you're confronted with

11

what would otherwise be a conflict, maybe refers to

12

should be read to mean includes rather than is defined

13

as.

14

MR. BECKER:

Well, I think we have to read

15

the definitional regulations together.

16

the terms in the exemption, companionship services,

17

babysitting services, casual basis, domestic service

18

employment, are all defined in the set of regulations,

19

point 3, point 4, point 5, point 6.

20

from the prefatory language of each one that what the

21

Department of Labor intended to do was define the terms

22

in the statute.

23
24
25

That is, all of

And it is clear

And so when it said that that term refers
to CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Well it is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interesting when you look at -- I mean, they're -- it's

2

a good point.

3

other definitions, the babysitting, it says this

4

provision shall mean.

5
6

It's interesting when you look at the

Here it just says it refers to.

Let's see, the other ones -- casual basis,
shall mean.

7

Companionship services, shall mean.
This one doesn't say shall mean.

It says it

8

refers to this.

9

that suggests it's not intended to be as exclusive as

10

I'm just wondering if that's something

the other definitions.

11

MR. BECKER:

I do not believe so, Your

12

Honor.

It is an exercise of the power to define the

13

term and I don't think we can take that language "refers

14

to" to be non-exclusive.

15

referred it was defining a statutory term as it said it

16

was.

17

intended, it actually of course reiterated that

18

definition under the interpretive classification.

19

it again said that the term refers to, is defined as,

20

employment by the household.

When the Department said

If we have any doubt about what the Department

And

If we had any doubt -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Becker -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There it says

23

--there it says includes.

And if you're talking about

24

552.101, there it says the term includes persons

25

frequently referred to as private household workers.
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. BECKER:

I'm referring to an earlier

2

provision of the same regulation, not the reference to

3

private household workers, but where it states that the

4

definition includes those individuals who are employed

5

by the household, that is in 552.101(a).

6

any further doubt, the -- that regulation refers to, as

7

its source of the language, the regulation adopted under

8

the Social Security Act, now 20 CFR 404.1057.

9

originally numbered differently, but at the time, in

But if we had

It was

10

1974, that regulation which was explicitly the source of

11

the language the Department of Labor used, said not

12

once, not twice, but three times, that the individual

13

had to be employed by the household.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. -- Mr. Becker, if

15

there is room for the Agency to read this statute either

16

way, one way that the third party employee would come

17

under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the other that they

18

would not, would be treated the same way as the person

19

employed by the elderly person himself or herself, but

20

if the concern of Congress in making this exemption was

21

for the householder with limited funds, if the Agency is

22

subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act, it's going to

23

end up being the householder paying for it anyway.

24
25

So why isn't the most reasonable
interpretation of what Congress meant by the exemption
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the exemption would apply across the board, so that

2

all workers in this category would be exempt?

3

MR. BECKER:

Your Honor, setting aside, of

4

course, all the reasons about Congress's intent in 552.3

5

which we've already explained, we would not say that

6

that there is any credible evidence in the legislative

7

history or the text of the Act to suggest that cost was

8

a factor.

9

And let me explain why.

The Department for

10

the first time when it promulgated its advisory

11

memorandum suggested this was the basis of the third

12

party regulation.

13

As support for the assertion it cited four isolated

14

comments in the legislative history.

15

except the last -- and there is only one of t-h-e-m

16

related in any way to the exemption.

17

related to the exemption in fact directly supports our

18

position, because it describes those people who are not

19

within the exemption as the professional domestics.

20

It said nothing of the sort in 1975.

None of them

The one that

So we don't think that there's any basis for

21

suggesting that cost was the underlying rationale; and,

22

in fact, it is really implausible.

23

time, for example, Congress extended the provisions of

24

the Act which covered nursing homes.

25

as has been pointed out, Congress only exempted casual
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Because at the same

At the same time,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

babysitters.

Now We would submit that if Congress was

2

concerned about cost, in creating this babysitter and

3

companionship exemption, the primary intended

4

beneficiaries of that would have been working families

5

where both people worked and therefore who require a

6

full-time baby sitter -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

covered.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF H. BARTOW FARR,

14

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

15

MR. FARR:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.

16

Respondent in response to Justice Scalia's

17

question about how Respondent would reconcile the

18

regulation 552.3 and 109(a) actually did not I believe

19

attempt any reconciliation.

20

respondent's position correctly, it's simply 109(a) has

21

to be invalidated dated and 552.3 stands in its

22

entirety.

23

If I understand

I think that's incorrect for several

24

reasons.

First of all, the basis for it is essentially

25

this apparent distinction between the define and delimit
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority and the more general authority to enact

2

necessary rules and regulation.

3

Justice Breyer pointed out in his question, both grants

4

of authority were invoked by the Department when it

5

enacted both regulations simultaneously, not limited to

6

either subpart A or subpart B, and for the reasons that

7

Justice Alito points out, it is a very odd thing to

8

attribute to the Department to say that it would

9

exercise two different legislative powers in different

10
11

But, in fact, as

parts of the -- of the regulations.
There's no reason it would do that.

The

12

subpart B regulations clearly are regulations that

13

delimit the terms of the exemption in 213(a)(15).

14

There's no question about that.

15

was doing what Congress authorized it to do under

16

213(a)(15), would it instead of relying on the grant of

17

authority in that provision, rely on some other general

18

grant of authority?

19

attribute that to the Department.

20

So why in fact if it

It makes no logical sense to

And it seems to me, in -- excuse me -- in

21

fact, that that argument points up one of the

22

difficulties here.

23

here are a way of simply trying to push the Department

24

aside so that the courts can ultimately do the final job

25

of exposition on this exemption.

It seems to me that the arguments

Not only contrary to

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the basic principle of Chevron, which is where that

2

where is ambiguity in the statute, or room for

3

interpretation, the agencies are given the opportunity

4

to do that within reasonable bounds; it is also contrary

5

to the statute.

6

It is clear as I said at the beginning of my

7

argument, the Department was the agency chosen by

8

Congress to do the work of defining and delimiting the

9

exception.

10

Now I'd like to say just one other thing in

11

response to Justice Stevens' question about the

12

particular nature of the litigation.
