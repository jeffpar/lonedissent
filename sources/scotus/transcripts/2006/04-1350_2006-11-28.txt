ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. DABNEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. DABNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case concerns a very broadly worded

12

patent claim, claim 4 of the Engelgau patent, that the

13

Solicitor General and the United States Patent and

14

Trademark Office have both told this Court is invalid

15

under Section 103 of the Patent Act and was issued in

16

error.

17

judgment in this case is grounded in a judicially

18

devised test that is fundamentally inconsistent with -

19

The Federal Circuit's vacatur of summary

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask, if that's the

20

position of the PTO, why aren't they proceeding to

21

cancel the patent?

22

MR. DABNEY:

The case is in litigation at

23

this point, Justice Ginsburg, and in patent litigation

24

district courts are

vested with authority and this

invalidity under Section 282 of the Patent Act.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the question is, you

3

say the PTO has recognized that it issued this patent,

4

that it's an invalid issuance.

5

curing their own mistakes, never mind what a court is

6

going to do?

7

MR. DABNEY:

So why aren't they

Well, there is the possibility

8

of director- initiated re-examination of patents as

9

certainly an administrative remedy that does exist.

But

10

where a case is in pending litigation such as this, the

11

traditional way that these disputes are resolved is for

12

a court to apply the law to the facts and render a

13

judgment on a defense of invalidity which has been

14

pleaded to the plaintiff's claim of patent infringement

15

in this case.

16

defense pleaded to a claim for patent infringement and

17

I'm not sure that the Patent Office really could swoop

18

in and cut off the plaintiff's claim in the manner Your

19

Honor is suggesting.

20

This issue arises in the context of a

The Federal Circuit in this case applied the

21

approach it's applied in previous cases, which is a

22

categorical approach.

23

matter what might be the nature of an alleged invention

24

or improvement, no matter how broad might be a claim

25

made in an issued patent, no matter how small might be

The Federal Circuit says that no

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the difference between a patent claim and prior art, and

2

no matter how modest might have been the degree of skill

3

needed to devise subject matter described by a patent

4

claim, the Federal Circuit says regardless of any or all

5

of that a court of the United States can never, ever

6

sustain a defense of invalidity under Section 103 of the

7

Patent Act except in a very limited and narrowly defined

8

circumstance.

9

That circumstance is a record that includes

10

clear and convincing evidence, that yields a jury

11

verdict or specific finding showing what the Federal

12

Circuit calls a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to

13

combine prior art teachings in the particular manner

14

claimed by the patent at issue.

15

case treats Section 103 not, as this Court has said, as

16

a codification of a condition for patentability whose

17

benchmark is skill and ingenuity.

18

case treats section 1 as implementing a supposed

19

entitlement to patent protection that a court -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We're talking about what

24

the law should be.

Would you make, be making the same

25

argument if we were looking at the most recent decisions
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the Federal Circuit, the ones that they issued within

2

the year, and each as I remember they held that the

3

patent was obvious and therefore invalid?

4

were dealing in what was, the cases were, what were

5

they, Kahn, Alpha, and Diestar?

6

MR. DABNEY:

Suppose we

Your Honor, what the Federal

7

Circuit has done in recent times has been after a

8

certiorari was granted in this case to erect a series of

9

escape devices from what is otherwise a categorical test

10

that must be imposed in all cases.

11

matter the Federal Circuit still characterizes as an

12

issue of fact for determination by a jury the presence

13

or absence of teaching, suggestion, or motivation, and

14

so these seemingly remedial steps that have been taken

15

by the Federal Circuit do not materially affect the

16

problem that's praised by this case, which is the well

17

nigh impossibility nowadays of being able to have an

18

efficient, inexpensive, quick and predictable

19

determination of whether claimed subject matter meets

20

the statutory standard.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

As a practical

But what is the difference

22

between asking whether something is implicit in the, in

23

the prior art and simply asking whether it would have

24

been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art?

MR. DABNEY:

precedents make the benchmark of patentability skill,

into motivation, not skill.

9

granted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person

What

Those two are very

10

had hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows

11

he could do.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Of course, the

13

reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this

14

additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say

15

obviousness is, it's deceptive in hindsight.

16

hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that;

17

and that you need -- if you don't have the sort of

18

constraint that their test imposes, it's going to be too

19

easy to say that everything was obvious.

20

MR. DABNEY:

In

Well, the Court, Mr. Chief

21

Justice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant

22

by the term "hindsight."

23

looking at what's claimed now, the subject matter sought

24

to be patented, and comparing that to the prior art, to

25

call that analytical process improper hindsight is to

If by hindsight is meant

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

make a frontal assault on the statute itself.

2

hindsight means to posit a desired result, a clay

3

doorknob, and to ask whether more skill and ingenuity

4

than were required by ordinary skill in the art was

5

needed to do that, to say that that constitutes improper

6

hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the entire

7

body of this Court's precedents construing section 103

8

and its common law predecessors.

9

If by

With regard to the kind of bias Your Honor

10

is talking about, this Court's precedents provide a

11

wealth of mechanisms for protecting against that,

12

including the statement towards the end of the Graham

13

opinion, which is the only source of the word

14

"hindsight" that I've seen cited in the amici brief,

15

which was a discussion of the secondary consideration.

all kinds of motivation to solve it, and the fact that

it was not solved was considered important by this Court

it somehow teaches me to combine these two things, if it

says, Breyer, combine this and that, that's a teaching

and then it's obvious.

15

teaching, it just has the suggestion.

16

suggest you combine this or that; okay, then it's

17

obvious.

18

about 15 or 20 times now, it though I've read it about

So they can't mean that, and if they don't

MR. DABNEY:

Well, in this case what the

11

respondents is Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation

12

to look to the Asano-designed pedal because he was

13

trying to meet the requirements of Fort Motor Company

14

and Asano would not have met those requirements and

15

therefore Mr. Engelgau would have had no motivation to

16

start with Asano.

wouldn't have a motivation to look to the prior art to

MR. DABNEY:

I respectfully suggest You don't have a

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. DABNEY:

Fine, that's fine.

I believe if you study

10

carefully this Court's precedence, including Graham

11

itself and just about every other case this Court has

12

ever decided, what this Court has said is the measure,

13

what our society agreed to pay off on is subject matter

14

that reflects a certain degree of skill.

15

has rejected time and time again the notion that someone

16

who was the first simply to take advantage of the known

17

capability of technology was entitled to a patent.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this Court

Well, would it be, would

19

it be inadvisable for us to say the motive test teaches

20

us something important; it has a valuable place; it's

21

just not the exclusive test for what's obvious.

MR. DABNEY:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Certainly.
Or do we have to reject it

all out of -- out of hand?
MR. DABNEY:

of motivation to devise something.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Motivation in this special

sense.

4

MR. DABNEY:

Well, I'm not sure it is in a

5

special sense.

What the Federal Circuit has done is

6

has, it has attributed controlling significance to what

7

is in most cases at best a factor, and in fact is

8

nothing more than a legal argument about the preemptive

9

effect of prior art.

The motivation debate in this case

10

is all about what is the preemptive legal effect of the

11

Asano reference.

12

It either invalidates the claim -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We're -- I'm asking what the test ought

MR. DABNEY:

Well, the test, I mean in this

21

case, the specific claim at issue in this case is very

22

analogous to the claim that this Court considered in the

23

Anderson's-Black Rock case.

24

is no dispute as to any of the factual inquiries that

25

have traditionally defined patent validity analysis.

What we have in this case

5

The only issue in this case is what legal consequences

6

follow from that.

7

whether or not that difference adds up to a patentable

8

invention?

9

The level of skill is

The quantum of difference between the

What question do you ask to decide

It's very analogous to what was going on in

10

the Anderson's-Black Rock case.

11

was a case like this in which someone had invented a

12

radiant heat burner and the patentee in that case had

13

seen that there was a market for using that by attaching

14

it to an asphalt spreader.

15

case was taking someone else's invention, the radiant

16

heat burner and hanging it on a standard painting

17

apparatus and using it for its, one of its marketable

18

purposes.

19

Anderson's-Black Rock

So the patent claim in that

This Court held in this, in the

20

Anderson's-Black Rock case that the patentee had not

21

done anything patentable in that case.

22

was take a burner that functioned as a burner, and a

23

spreader that functioned as a spreader, and the two

24

components did not affect one another's operation at

25

all.

motivation to use that earlier patent, did he?

MR. DABNEY:

13

there actually was quite a story.

14

was a story that for years and years you'd had this cold

15

joint problem of laying successive courses of asphalt

16

that was interesting, that you could use this radiant

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

No.

It took

2

from 10 years to go from -- I think 10 years from Asano

3

to Engelgau, so it must have been not all that obvious.

4

MR. DABNEY:

Well, the, on this record, and

5

even if you take at face value what's said in the

6

respondent's brief in this case, which is very largely

7

not based on the record, the story is, from Mr. Engelgau

8

is, Fort Motor Company had a particular requirement and

9

Mr. Engelgau sat down to design to it.

He to design a

10

pedal that had would meet Ford's requirements and one

11

way that he did that was to come up with the kind of

12

pedal assembly that's shown in the figures of the

13

patent.

14

But we are not here talking about the

15

patentability of the figures of the patent.

16

talking about the patentability of claims 1, 2 or 3 of

17

the patent; we are talking about claim 4 in which these

respondents got a little greedy.

5

MR. DABNEY:

6

Well, Your Honor, with respect,

I could stand here and make

arguments.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean it seems to

8

me that the whole argument that you're making as to Ford

9

is that anybody knows you could, you use an electronic

10

-- you have an electronic throttle, it serves a purpose;

11

the pedal serves a purpose; put the two together.

12

15

MR. DABNEY:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

Well, because -- because -

MR. DABNEY:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

If they're invalid then I

have -- then I'm struggling to find what your test is.

18

20

Why doesn't -- don't 1, 2

Here's the reason.
I don't know what your

test is.
MR. DABNEY:

Here's the reason.

What's

22

shown in the figures of the Engelgau patent is an

23

adjustable pedal assembly that has a large bore tube

24

from which you suspended a pedal arm on a yoke, and it

25

slides back and forth along the tube.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

And that's the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

way that it provides for adjustment.

And in claims 1, 2

2

and 3 some of that structure is recited.

3

claims would not necessarily be invalid by the Asano

4

reference because the Asana adjustment mechanism doesn't

5

use a tube, and doesn't use a yoke; it uses pins and

6

slots and it provides adjustment by a different

7

mechanism.

8

2 and 3 in this case because those claims don't describe

9

anything remotely like the petitioner's pedals.

So those

The respondents have not asserted claims 1,

They

10

limited their claim to claim 4 because only by claiming

11

this enormous verbal abstraction that is claim 4 can

12

they make a colorable claim of patent infringement

13

against the petitioner in this case.

14

So I would respectfully submit that the

15

Court does not need to decide whether 1, 2 or 3 would be

16

valid but the point would be, the question would be what

17

we did in the Hotchkiss case or in the Anderson's-Black

18

Rock case or any of these cases.

19

more than ordinary skill to devise that claim structure

20

with those additional structural limitations to solve

21

some objectively defined problem, and that hasn't been

22

litigated or briefed.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would it have required

Going back to the asphalt

case, were you suggesting that if they had made a claim

25

for a process patent, that it might have been valid?

there would be a motivation to save money, which might

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

We agree that

11

teaching suggestion and motivation are valid means of

12

proving obviousness, valid considerations for the Court.

13

And this Court's precedents are entirely consistent with

14

that.

15

the Court has looked to suggestion as a means to

16

determining whether a patent is obvious.

A number of cases cited by respondent show that

17

The problem with the Federal Circuit's test

18

is it makes that the exclusive test and precludes

19

obviousness determinations in the absence of

20

satisfaction of that test which this Court's precedents

21

are clearly not consistent with.

22

itself, in the Sakraida case, in Dann against Johnston,

23

lower courts had held patents valid because of a lack of

24

suggestion.

25

even addressing the question whether there was some

foreign to this Court's precedents as a mandatory

legitimate reliance in lower court precedent that's

contrary to Supreme Court precedent, and it was an open

as this Court's Sakraida decision.

endorse that line of argumentation but even leaving that

aside, it's not justified here on the facts.

6

claims 1 through 3 are invalid; the problem here is that

It isn't just the Federal Circuit that has
It's also the Patent Office

and it's been following the Federal Circuit's test for

What, what is -- assuming that we sweep that

test aside and say it's been incorrect, what happens to

14

the presumption of validity of, of patents which the

15

courts have been, have been traditionally applying?

16

Does it make any sense to presume that patents are valid

17

which have been issued under an erroneous test for the

18

last 20 years?

19

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, I think that it

20

would make sense because the statute requires it, and as

21

a practical matter it shouldn't make any difference,

22

because the only category of cases in which the result

23

would change under our test is the category in which as

24

a matter of law, in light of the factual issues that are

25

required under Graham, as a matter of law the Court
23
Alderson Reporting Company

concludes that the difference between the claimed

2

invention and the prior art is so trivial that it cannot

be given the protection of a patent.

circumstances the presumption doesn't come into play.

5

It's a legal determination; the presumption has been

understood to effect the burden of proof, and in the

2

Another problem with the Federal Circuit's

test is that it devalues and de-emphasizes the statutory

focus and this Court's focus in Graham on the

5

capabilities of the person of ordinary skill.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well when you talk

7

about the statutory focus, your innovation test -- I

8

mean, do you regard that, is that a legal conclusion of

9

nonobviousness?

10

Or is it an additional test beyond what

the statute requires?

11

MR. HUNGAR:

We haven't suggested an

12

innovation test, Your Honor.

We were simply attempting

13

to describe in perhaps imprecise terms the holding of

14

this Court in Graham, and the holding of this Court in

15

Graham is that the ultimate inquiry for the court,

16

obviously suggestion, teaching, motivation, teaching a

17

way in the prior art, all of these are factual,

18

subsidiary factual issues that will shed light and a

19

great deal of light on the ultimate question in each

20

particular case, but ultimately the question for the

21

court is whether in light of all those underlying

22

factual showings the differences between the claimed

23

invention and the prior art are sufficient to, that they

24

would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in

25

the art.

And that ultimately is a legal determination,
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you can refer to that as sufficiently innovative to

2

justify a patent, but the ultimate question, the

3

ultimate test is the one set forth in the statute and in

4

the Graham decision.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In this case, would there

have been anything for a jury under your test?

7

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor, because in this

8

case it is perfectly clear that it would have been

9

obvious for a person of ordinary skill to take the Asano

10

patent, add the sensor, the electronic sensor in a

11

manner that that off-the-shelf sensor is designed to be

12

added, and voila, you have a winning combination.

MR. HUNGAR:

There are two

question.

And moreover and more importantly, the

problem with the Court of Appeals analysis, one problem,

and with the experts' analysis, is that they're focusing

17

on the narrow definition of the quote unquote problem by

looking only at what this particular inventor was trying

to solve, but the scope of the claim is far broader.

Federal Circuit means by its test is not obvious, is

5

something that's either apparent or not apparent, and

that's what the Federal Circuit is asking.

that there is an implicit motivation to combine.

Well, the claim goes beyond

that.

Your claim goes beyond the Asano combination and

in your brief you, you, you discuss the case as though

4

your, your limited claim 4 just relates to this

invention that you, you -- nobody would have thought of

6

using the Asano pedal in the Ford car given the limited

space available and so forth, and therefore, this was

If this isn't going to be hindsight, where we just

so -

But all it's asking for is for the

That is what's

You look at that thing, you

8

think what this genius did, and I don't doubt that he's

10

wheels turn around to a fixed proportion to when you

11

make the accelerator go up and down.

high school a person has known that if you have three

13

parts in a machine and they each move in a fixed ratio

14

one to the other, you can measure the speed of any part

15

by attaching a device to any other as long as you know

these elementary mathematics.

Mr. Engelgau, it was probably Archimedes that figured

that one out.

on my garage door at the lower hinge for when the car is

23

coming in and out, and the raccoons are eating it.

24

think of the brainstorm of putting it on the upper

25

So I

Now I just think that how could I get a

company decides to switch to electronic throttles, of

No, I don't.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you're saying that the

Yes, that's right.

And what

addressed this claim.

that it can be implicit, it can be based on common

Could you

Well, all that it adds is an

It's an elaboration.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The word

It adds a layer of

7

Federal Circuit jargon that lawyers can then bandy back

8

and forth, but if it's -- particularly if it's

9

nonexclusive, you can say you can meet our teaching,

10

suggestion, or motivation test or you can show that it's

11

nonobvious, it seems to me that it's worse than

12

meaningless because it complicates the inquiry rather

13

than focusing on the statute.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

15

reason that the Federal Circuit disagrees and over 30

16

years this special court has elaborated this problem -

17

these judges alone, for example, have heard 300 cases on

18

nonobviousness -- is that we need a guidance, we need

19

guidance for the lower courts.

20

the right question, and for patent examiners and patent

21

practitioners, and the right question is not is -- was

22

someone merely capable of putting the two together.

23

right question is is there any reason to believe that it

24

would have been apparent at the time of the invention to

25

create this invention whether it's through a teaching, a

We need to focus them on

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or anything else.
So why don't you say that?
They have.
It is -- I agree with the

7

Chief Justice.

It is misleading to say that the whole

8

world is embraced within these three nouns, teaching,

9

suggestion, or motivation, and then you define teaching,

10

suggestion, or motivation to mean anything that renders

11

it nonobvious.

12

it's irrational.

13

This is gobbledygook.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It really is,

Justice Scalia, I this it

14

would be surprising for this experienced Court and all

15

of the patent bar -- remember, every single major patent

16

bar association in the country has filed on our side -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

that cut?

19

for the patent bar.

That just indicates that this is profitable

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

22
23

Well, which way does

Mr. Chief Justice, it turns

out that actually is not accurate.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It produces more patents,

24

which is what the patent bar gets paid for, to acquire

25

patents, not to get patent applications denied but to

get them granted.

obviousness standard to these three imponderable nouns,

3

the more likely it is that the patent will be granted.

4

And the more you narrow the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, that is not

5

the point of these bar associations' either.

associations, including the American Bar Association,

7

the American Intellectual Property Law Association, have

8

lawyers on both sides of all these cases.

9

looking for a test that has balance and that is what the

10
11

Federal Circuit has done.

These bar

They're

Now, let me just say -

JUSTICE BREYER:

As you know, we've had a

12

series of cases and in these series of cases we have

13

received many, many briefs from all kinds of

14

organizations and there are many from various parts of

15

the patent bar that defend very much what the Federal

16

circuit does and there are many from parts of the patent

17

bar and others who are saying basically that they've

18

leaned too far in the direction of never seeing a patent

19

they didn't like and that has unfortunate implications

20

for the economy.

21

deep issues, is there a reason for me to think, which I

22

do now think, that there is a huge argument going on in

23

those who are interested in patent as to whether there

24

is too much protectionism and not enough attention paid

25

to competition or whether it's about right, or whether

So if you're going to these very basic

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it goes some other way.

2

In other words, your argument now suggests

3

all this is well settled, but I tend to think maybe it

4

isn't well settled and maybe it is a proper thing for us

5

to be involved in.

6

brought it up?

7

So what are your views since you

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Breyer, there is a

8

big debate over whether or not there is too much

9

patenting in this country and Congress is involved in

10

the debate.

11

debate about is whether a properly applied test that the

12

Federal Circuit has articulated strikes the right

13

balance, because that is why all of the patent bar

14

associations have filed on our side, I think, and that

15

is it takes account of the interests of both sides and

16

that is it says, you're right, we have to be concerned

17

about overpatenting, it says on the other hand we have

18

to be very concerned about hindsight determinations of

19

obviousness.

20

What I don't think that there is that much

But I do want to just step back and make a

21

point about judicial administration.

22

conclusion of this Court is that teaching, suggestion,

23

motivation just boils down into an inquiry into

24

obviousness, I still think that an opinion that says

25

that and says that it, that this Court believes that it
43
Alderson Reporting Company

If the ultimate

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is embracing the bottom line of what the Federal Circuit

2

has been doing, is the one that will be much better for

3

the patent system and for the courts, because we have a

4

real concern and that was articulated -- asked about at

5

least by Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, and that

6

is if you purport to change the rules unnecessarily, if

7

you say we're going off in a different direction, this

8

test has -- underlies 160,000 patents issued every year.

9

There is no rhyme or reason to applying a presumption of

10

validity if you're saying the patent examiner applied

11

the wrong test.

12

instability.

13

And it will create genuine dramatic

The question I think is if you think instead

14

that the teaching, suggestion, motivation test is

15

incomplete, what is it that you want to add on top of

16

it, and that's really what I didn't understand from the

17

first half-hour.

18

If it's going to be -

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't have to go on

19

top.

It's just to say what you've been saying, that

20

what you're supposed to look to ultimately is whether a

21

person, as the statute says, who is familiar with the

22

subject, of ordinary skill in the art, whether to such a

23

person this would have been obvious.

24

many, and this Court has listed several, factors that

25

might count in favor of it not being obvious, such as
44

Now, there are

5

If there's a

But to hope to have a nonexclusive list

6

seems to me a little bit like Holmes trying to hope to

have an exclusive list of what counts as negligence.

the law we have many standards that you can get clues

9

about, but you can't absolutely define them, and why

10

In

isn't this one of them?

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Breyer, I think

12

that's the dilemma that the Federal Circuit has been

13

facing and is in answer to the criticism of Justice

14

Scalia and that is the Federal Circuit isn't trying to

15

articulate every single possible thing that can show you

16

that it is obvious.

17

on the right question.

It's trying to say, here's the

18

process of invention:

It's picking out the prior art and deciding how

JUSTICE BREYER:

Supposing we then were to

2

say exactly what this Court already said, that the

3

standard here is obvious, we list a few of these

4

additional factors that they've thrown in, and just as

5

the Court said before, all these additional factors are

6

there.

7

but it is important to remember that the ultimate matter

8

which is for the judge is to apply the word "obvious" or

9

not in light of the evidence and what the experts say

They can be considered in an appropriate case,

10

and the facts as found by a jury or whoever is the

11

factfinder.

12

like that.

Would you have any objection to an opinion

13

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well then, in this case

15

let's assume that we all strike out on coming out with

16

the magic formulation.

17

progresses is we go from case to case, and in this case

18

you have two standards of operation.

One is a pedal

that basically operates by pressure.

The other -- and

by levers.

Let me take you to a picture if I could, and

What we say is there is going to be a fixed pivot.

It looks like this.
It's

electronic throttle control.

12

you can't see it because you're looking straight at the

invention where in fact there are only four or five

21

moving parts on the thing that we have seen, every one

22

of the moving parts is moving with a fixed ratio to the

23

accelerator going up and down, as it must be because

24

they're also moving in fixed ratio with the throttle

25

thing coming out.

And so, whichever of those four that
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you figured out you were going to attach it to, it's

2

obvious, isn't it, that you have to attach it either to

the pedal or to the throttle thing that comes out, or to

4

a part of the machine that moves in fixed ratio to the

5

movements of one of those two?

6

find fairly obvious.

7

Now, that's what I would

Why isn't that obvious?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

All right.

Let me, Justice

8

Breyer.

The experts say it's not obvious and the reason

9

nobody did it for 12 years and the reason that Asano was

10

never combined with an electronic throttle control is

11

explained in the record in this case and it's twofold.

12

The first is, and I have to take you now to the picture

13

of Asano because that's what the claim that is supposed

to make our invention obvious is.

You keep coming

Why do you keep coming back?

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Your claim

Justice Scalia, the way

13

these cases are litigated, and properly so, is the other

14

side says this would be obvious in light of a particular

15

piece or collection of prior art.

going to say something else already exists.

it's Asano, and you're going to combine it with

the argument that was presented to the Federal Circuit,

was that you would take Asano.

You may have a

This is their motion.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They say

Their argument,

That's why -

I think they happened to

23

use Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on.

24

But I think their basis, their basic point, is anybody

25

would have thought to stick it on, whether it's stick it
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on Asano or stick it onto some other mechanical

2

accelerator mechanism.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, that is not -- we did

4

not stick it on Asano.

Nobody stuck it on Asano.

5

picked Asano because it was the prior art of adjustable

6

pedal designs.

7

Justice Scalia, you -

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

They

Well, that's because

the Federal Circuit's approach focuses narrowly prior to

10

our grant of certiorari, allegedly more flexibly after,

11

on prior art, as opposed.

12

To I would say common sense.

And so they

13

say we have to find something in prior art to show that

14

this was non -- that this was obvious.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, that's

16

not correct.

17

under an extraordinary innovation standard, you are

18

going to compare something to prior art.

19

to take what exists now and compare it to what existed

20

before, no matter what standard you're employing.

21

what they did is they compared it to the prior art,

22

which is Asano, and the Federal Circuit said, all right,

23

you want to say it will come from Asano.

24

come from Asano for either of two reasons.

25

Even under a capability standard, even

You're going

It would not

The first is you would never use Asano.
51
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

That's the expert testimony.

The second is the reason

2

given by the PTO in its brief in this case and that is

3

you wouldn't put it on the pin that would render

4

Engelgau obvious.

5

They say that you would put it attached to a lever up

6

high.

7

first is, though the Federal Circuit has in recent

8

opinions been quite emphatic about how inclusive its

9

test is, it has consistently cited earlier Federal

You would put it somewhere else.

What I want to make clear is two things.

The

10

Circuit precedent and said that the other side and the

11

people who claimed that their standard is too narrow and

12

misguided are mischaracterizing it.

13

the judgment in this case quite explicitly acknowledges

14

and implies the implicit teaching, suggestion,

15

motivation standard.

16

And the second is,

So I don't want you to have the mistaken

17

impression that there has been some radical change in

18

Federal Circuit law.

19

about the differential between Federal Circuit law today

20

and Federal Circuit law a year ago or two years ago,

21

there is a quite considerable cost by articulating a

22

desire to head off in a new direction, because there

will be dramatic instability in the patent system, the

incalculable investments that underlie current patents.

something quite explicit in the prior art?

Or that those decisions here

You can't take, in a system that produces so

6

many patents, and say ah, look at this side swing

patent, or the garbage bags, and draw from that the

8

conclusion that the system is fundamentally broken.

9

Justice Breyer, I meant to come back to

10

that.

We can look through the studies, we cite a series

11

of empirical studies in our brief that have looked at

12

this problem, the rhetorical claim that the obviousness

13

rule is leading to gross over-patenting.

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Tell me again, just to be

15

sure I have it my -- tell me very briefly, what it is

16

that makes this invention nonobvious?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Two things.

The first is -

18

and they do arise from the other side's motion under

19

Asano.

20

second is the Federal Circuit explained -- excuse me,

21

the Solicitor General explains that you would have put

22

the electronic throttle control somewhere else,

23

technically on what's called pivot 60, which would not,

24

would have rendered, would have not have rendered

25

Engelgau obvious.

First you wouldn't have chosen Asano.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The invention, to use an

old-fashioned term, is the decision of where to put the

3

control.

4
5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is the extent of the

entire invention.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And just -- what

7

makes it nonobvious is that it's attached to a nonmoving

8

piece?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:
a nonmoving pivot, yes.

15

(Laughter.)

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But just to follow

17

up from Justice Stevens' question, what makes this

18

nonobvious is the decision to place the electronic

19

control on a part of the car that doesn't move?

Isn't there an axis, and

the axis turns?

5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The pivot rotates?
The pivot rotates, but it

8

doesn't -- the difference is that the pivot doesn't move

9

with the adjustment of the pedal.

It spins around, of

10

course, you have to have something that you can -- but

11

the prior art, almost all that involved a pivot that

12

when the pedal moved out, the electronic throttle

13

control would go with it.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the wires would

15

get worn, worn down, right?

16

well, let's not put it somewhere where it doesn't move,

17

and so the wires won't move and it won't get worn down.

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And the invention here is

That would be a motivation.

19

That's absolutely right, why you would want to improve

20

on the part.

21

never do it in the way that was described here.

You may

22

be able to prove it some other way on a remand.

This

23

was a very specific motion, and the Federal Circuit

faithfully addressed the claim of obviousness that was

presented to it.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY JAMES W. DABNEY

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. DABNEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

As someone who tries patent cases, there is

8

no legal regime that is a greater generator of patent

9

litigation than the teaching suggestion motivation test

10

that is urged by the respondent.

11

unbelievable situation where, in the District Court,

12

this Court's precedents were cited, were not followed.

13

In the Court of Appeals, this Court's precedents in

14

Anderson's-Black Rock and others were cited, not

15

distinguished, followed at all.

16

Where in this

If the law of this Court had been applied in

17

the District Court I wouldn't be standing here right

18

now.

19

going on is because of this extraordinary situation,

20

where notwithstanding that this Court has issued

21

precedents in a variety of circumstances dealing with

22

multiple technologies, lots of different kinds of

23

differences, lots of different kinds of alleged

24

innovation, they are simply not paid attention to in the

25

corpus of the Federal Circuit's case law up until about

The reason that we have this, this proceeding

2

So the, this Court could do no greater

3

service to the actual process of determining whether

4

claimed subject matter does and does not comply with the

5

statute than to decide with case.

6

thing that can happen in this case is for the case not

7

to end here, and for the Court not to provide a

8

precedent as it has done in so many particular past

9

cases, and give the public an example of a particular

10

claim and a particular difference that does not meet the

15

approach; it's not as opposing counsel suggests -- is

16

"it" apparent, is "it" obvious, would it have been

17

obvious to do "it?"

18

What we have as a functional

What this Court has held over and over again

19

starting with the doorknob case in 1851 is to pose a

20

problem.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What about in this case

22

where the wires were getting frayed until this

23

disclosure?

MR. DABNEY:

That's not, if you read the

affidavits carefully that is not an accurate

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

characterization of -- of any evidence put in by the

2

petitioner.

3

That was an argument JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So suppose I read the

4

record the other way.

5

saying this invention stopped the wires from being

6

frayed and therefore it was an advance.

7

MR. DABNEY:

Suppose I read the record as

That would be, to the extent

8

that that -- if that is established that could be taken

9

into consideration along with other facts.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why would that be?

I mean,

11

I've worked out that the raccoons are gnawing the

12

machine, at the bottom of the garage door and that's a

13

problem.

14

Does that suddenly -- nobody before thought of moving it

15

to the top of the garage door; nobody before had thought

16

of moving it to a different part that moves in a

17

constant ratio with the accelerator.

18

So I move it to the top of the garage door.

MR. DABNEY:

What the statute calls for,

19

Justice Kennedy, is not to focus on a particular

20

subjective problem like fitting into a Ford F 350, or

21

particular difference between a prior art pedal that

22

provides wire chafing and a claimed invention.

23

has always required that the patentability be determined

24

by the smallest amount of difference.

25

true that there was wire chafing, that that was a
59
Alderson Reporting Company

The law

So if it were

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

problem that would have had to have been overcome, if

2

you started with a prior art pedal that, that provided

3

for wires to move -- well then, maybe that combination

4

would not make the claimed subject matter obvious.

5

But that would not foreclose the defendant

6

from saying well, this other technology over here that

7

doesn't suffer from that problem, it's a simple matter

8

to modify that, so the premise of the question, that

9

because there is some other potential combination that

10

might have been, might have been more difference or less

11

reason to modify it than the one that's relied on by the

12

petitioner, is legally not material to the decision in

13

this case.

14

So I respectfully submit that the -- I

15

really have to emphasize this.

16

litigation between, you know, two real businesses.

17

justified expectations, Justice Souter that I think this

18

Court has recognized over and over again, are the

19

expectations of real innovators, who make real products

20

and have real inventions.

21

come as a great surprise to the owner of the Asano

22

patent to find as Justice Breyer suggested, that in

23

order to supply it to a modern vehicle maker it would

24

have to pay tribute to the Engelgau patent.
