Mr. Steiker.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. STEIKER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case is here for the second time.

In

12

your summary of reversal, this Court held that

13

Petitioner's mitigating evidence could not be given

14

adequate consideration through the Texas special

15

issues or the nullification instructions.

16

the CCA found the error harmless by concluding the

17

opposite, that Petitioner's jury could give

18

sufficient consideration to his mitigating evidence,

19

including specifically the evidence of his 78 IQ,

20

learning disabilities and troubled background.

On remand,

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did they find it could or

22

did they find that it did?

I thought our holding was

23

that given the instructions, the jury would not

24

necessarily take into account those mitigating

25

factors, and I thought that what the Texas court held
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is, yes, that was a possibility, and we have to see

2

whether that possibility came to pass, which is what

3

harmless error analysis involves.

4

MR. STEIKER:

5
6

I think, Justice Scalia,

what the JUSTICE SCALIA:

So they are not

7

contradicting the fact that the jury wasn't required

8

to take it into account, but they are saying

9

nonetheless, in our view, the jury did take it into

10

account, and therefore, the error was harmless.

11

doesn't contradict our opinion.

12

want to argue against it on the merits, but I don't

13

think that will contradict our opinion.

14

MR. STEIKER:

That

I mean, you might

I think it does contradict

15

your opinion, Justice Scalia.

16

Petitioner's mitigating evidence had little or

17

nothing to do with the inquiries of the special

18

issues, and your opinion also said that the

19

nullification instruction, no matter how clearly

20

conveyed or fully understood by the jury, would not

21

solve that problem.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your opinion said that

That's right.

And that

23

means that the jury was not instructed to take it

24

into account.

25

conceding that.

And I think the Texas court is
But it's, it's saying, nonetheless,
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we don't think that the error made any difference

2

because, in our view, the jury did take it into

3

account.

4

MR. STEIKER:

The matter in which the CCA

5

posited that the jury could take it into account was

6

the fact that on voir dire, the jurors said we can

7

follow a nullification instruction and falsify our

8

answers to the special issues in order to give effect

9

to mitigating evidence.

That was the exact same

10

proposition that the CCA had issued in its first

11

opinion that this Court summarily reversed.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it seems to me

13

it's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying

14

the instruction was okay.

15

use it for the purpose of saying even though the

16

instruction didn't require that, it was a fuzzy

17

instruction and a juror could very reasonably have

18

understood it not to allow nullification,

19

nonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the

20

jury indeed thought it had the nullification power.

21

I don't see how it contradicts our opinion.

22

MR. STEIKER:

And it's something else to

I think what's

23

contradictory, Your Honor, is that the notion that

24

the nullification instruction would be an adequate

25

vehicle was what this Court specifically rejected.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They didn't say it was an

2

adequate vehicle.

3

that instruction shouldn't be given again because it

4

doesn't require the jury to do what, what you say the

5

jury must do, and I think they accept that.

6

say, oh, no, I thought it was fuzzy, and didn't

7

require -- we think the jury did indeed think it had

8

the power to nullify.

9

I mean, they acknowledged that

MR. STEIKER:

They

And I would also add that

10

when you actually look at the voir dire on which the

11

CCA relied in which it said jurors express no

12

discomfort, no hesitation about their willingness to

13

falsify their answers to the special issues, the very

14

first juror in this case, a lawyer, expressed exactly

15

the kinds of discomfort that this Court feared and

16

anticipated with the use of the nullification

17

instruction.

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, Mr. Steiker, may I

19

interrupt you or interrupt the course of your

20

argument to get to a more preliminary point before

21

you get down to details?

22

harmless error analysis is ever appropriate, is ever

23

open as an option following an, in effect, a finding

24

of this kind of instructional error, Penry I

25

instructional error?

Do you concede that

Do you concede that?
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. STEIKER:

Justice Souter, we do not

2

concede that, but nor do we rely on that as a basis

3

for relief in this case.

4

purported harmless error analysis that the CCA

5

applied was so interwoven with a rejection of the

6

Federal constitutional -

We believe that the

13

Was the, was the issue of the

the case in the proceedings back in Texas?
MR. STEIKER:

Yes, it was.

It was raised

on remand from this Court.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Also on the same

14

preliminary line of inquiry, are we in as good a

15

position as the State court to conduct harmless error

16

analysis, or can we or must we defer to the State

17

court's harmless error analysis?

18

MR. STEIKER:

I would say ordinarily this

19

Court is not in as good a position as a State court

20

to conduct harmless error analysis.

21

is that the, the basis for the State finding the

22

error harmless was a very unusual rejection of the

23

conclusion that this, these instructions would

24

facilitate consideration of mitigating evidence.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Our belief here

You agree that the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

application of the harmless error analysis is a

2

question of State law, though, correct?

3

MR. STEIKER:

I do not agree with that.

4

think that the application of harmless error

5

analysis, when it's predicated on a misunderstanding

6

of Federal constitutional law, is not an independent

7

basis for decision.

8

Federal claim, and I think this Court's cases have

9

clearly so held.

10

I

It's clearly wrapped up in the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So that if there is an

11

instruction given to the jury and it violates the

12

Constitution, then we, as a de novo matter, can

13

determine the harmless error, harmless error inquiry?

14

MR. STEIKER:

It's, it's certainly

15

possible.

16

and I wouldn't advocate that here.

17

usual case in which the State has conducted an

18

ordinary harmless error analysis.

19

actually in no way disparaged the power and extent of

20

Petitioner's mitigating evidence.

21

I don't think that that's a usual practice

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this is not a

The State has

Well, is the level of

22

harmless error determined as a matter of Federal or

23

State law when there is a Federal law?

24
25

MR. STEIKER:

Generally speaking, it's a

matter of State law with some limitations.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Really.

You mean that

2

they could have something that it has to be harmless

3

beyond a reasonable doubt and we'd be bound by that?

4

MR. STEIKER:

Well, on direct review,

5

Chapman clearly says it's a Federal question what the

6

standard of review may be.

7

it's undoubted that a harmless beyond a reasonable

8

doubt standard is required by Chapman.

9

And on direct review,

This case doesn't present the issue on

10

whether on State -- post-conviction, a State can have

11

the latitude of requiring greater harm, because on

12

the CCA's own analysis, the standard of harm that's

13

applied on State habeas is identical to the standard

14

of harm that's applied on direct review, the standard

15

of Almanza, which posits Chapman error, harmless

16

beyond a reasonable doubt for preserved error, and

17

egregious harm for unpreserved error.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And, and this was

19

unpreserved error.

20

for everything.

21

the instructions at the time and therefore our

22

harmless error standard is -- is more rigorous than

23

it would otherwise be.

24

that?

25

I mean, they are not saying this

They are saying he did not object to

Petitioner plainly objected that the

6

special issues and verdict form did not allow for

consideration of his mitigating evidence.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That was

Yes, but that's a very

10

generalized argument, and what he won on was a very

11

specific point that, that this instruction in effect

12

required, if they were going to give mitigating

effect, required a jury nullification.

different instruction.

21

MR. STEIKER:

Had he

But he didn't.
Everyone at trial understood

22

that the special issues on the verdict form were

23

unalterable, that Texas law required the legislature

24

to specify what was on the special verdict form.

25

What the trial court invited counsel to do was to
10
Alderson Reporting Company

1

offer a different form of nullification in the

2

supplemental instruction that would then interpret

3

the special issues.

4

This Court's opinion in its summary

5

reversal made plain that the problem with

6

nullification instructions is broad and intractable

7

and applies to all nullification instructions.

What's your response?
MR. STEIKER:

I have special responses,

8

Your Honor.

The objection to the special verdict

9

form and the special issues was made plain in

10

pretrial motions and that objection was clearly

11

recognized by the trial judge at trial and denied at

12

trial when the instructions were being considered for

the purposes of voir dire.

applied a legal standard, the egregious harm

standard, that depends on failure of an objection.
12

1

So I would have thought they, they certainly thought

2

that there was an inadequate objection, or they

3

wouldn't have applied that standard.

4

MR. STEIKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I -- I

5

misspoke if I -- I conveyed the impression that they

did not suggest that it was inadequate objection.

the sense that it was made at the wrong time,

pretrial or at trial.

The judge, the judge, I

thought, told the lawyers what the charge would be,

to give these two things.

understanding of everyone.

MR. STEIKER:

It was the understanding of

everyone.

It's reflected in the record in the first

State habeas opinion that the Court of Criminal

21

Appeals acknowledges that the verdict form was

22

sacrosanct.

That was not going to be altered, so the

It sounds like you're

5

MR. STEIKER:

No, Your Honor.

I believe

6

that the CCA misunderstood the Federal law of the

7

relationship between Penry I and Penry II.

8

failing in this case was a verdict form that made no

And if the, if the State court held

I don't think it is an issue

of Texas law, Your Honor, because the basis for the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

argument?

6

assuming there is a harmless error issue, that

here is, if that is a Federal issue, then the

You said earlier that under Chapman,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

If we assume,

2

for the sake of argument, that there is disagreement

on that point, are there any cases of this Court on

the matter of adequacy of State procedural bars that

5

would support you, even on the assumption that it's a

6

State, not a Federal issue?

7

MR. STEIKER:

Well, clearly Ake vs.

8

Oklahoma holds that if the State invocation of the

9

procedural rule is dependent on a judgment about

10

Federal law, and that judgment is incorrect, it is

11

not an independent basis for decision under the

independent adequacy grounds.

MR. STEIKER:

My specific point is once he

18

has made it plain -- and this is all that Texas law

itself says is required -- once he has made it plain

20

that he objects to a special verdict form which

21

cannot allow for the consideration of mitigating

evidence, and this Court's holding is that that is

precisely the error in this case, that no

have applied?

We believe it is the latter.

That we are assuming that harmless error analysis

10

could apply here without conceding that it's

law, and I thought under Texas law you got a Chapman

2

analysis only if you were on direct review and had

3

preserved error.

4

Is that correct?

MR. STEIKER:

I think that the CCA's

5

position and Respondent's position is that Almanza

6

applies dually on direct review and post conviction,

7

and that that's that's their explanation for why the

8

State court didn't impose a procedural default on

9

State habeas.

And one of our views is even if you

10

don't agree that under Federal law this objection was

11

inadequate, we believe that the State could not in

12

effect change its mind about the adequacy of his

13

trial objection only after this Court summarily

14

reversed its rule on the merits.

When four judges signal that this may be a

this Court that -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Wouldn't it be

4

normal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we

5

don't have to reach out and decide whether this error

6

was harmless if we've already decided there's no

7

error at all?

8
9

MR. STEIKER:

I think it would not be in

the case of State habeas, for this reason.

The vast

10

overwhelming number of cases that proceed into State

11

habeas are on their way when they're final into

12

Federal habeas, and the State court was abandoning

13

this argument for Federal habeas.

14

removing any procedural impediment to a merits

15

review.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That is, it was

Well, I just don't -- you

17

say whenever, whenever a court decides the case on

18

the merits instead of using an intervening procedural

19

objection, the procedural objection is waived.

20

MR. STEIKER:

No, I do not make that, I do

21

not make that broad argument, Your Honor.

22

the special circumstances of State habeas, where, as

23

this Court knows, 99 percent of cases are on their

24

way to Federal habeas, and the State does not adopt

this procedural impediment which would from a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it's a very

11

bad -- I think in the long term in the broad category

12

of cases, it would be a very bad solution for

13

defendants, because what's going to happen, once a

14

court's determined there's no error at all, it's much

15

easier for them to say, oh and by the way if there

16

was it's harmless.

17

turns out there was an error, you're going to be back

18

here saying, well, don't be bound by their harmless

error decision because they thought there was no

20

error at all, so they didn't focus on it carefully.

And if they did that and then it

I would say the way they approached it in

this case is the more desirable way.

it's harmless or not in the abstract.

MR. STEIKER:

If you don't

In the vast majority of
22

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases, Chief Justice Roberts, the courts in Texas

2

take that approach, which is if there is a procedural

3

impediment to the case they flag that procedural

4

impediment, rule on alternative grounds, and I think

5

that is good evidence that in this case when four

6

justices urged a procedural element -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why, why, why do you say

8

there are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter?

9

would have thought every case it mattered.

I

Look,

10

isn't it an absolute rule that there's a Federal

11

issue in a case and there's a State ground, the State

12

ground typically is a failure to raise an objection,

13

and a State court says the Federal ground is what

14

we're talking about.

15

State ground and they decide the Federal ground.

entitled to be released because they got the Federal

ground wrong.

case, and this is where you'll correct me, that it's

20

now too late for the State to raise the State ground

21

but the State's waived their adequate and independent

22

State ground and that if they try to raise it again

23

the answer is always, not some of the time:

between waiving it as a procedural bar and waiving it

when the case goes into Federal habeas that

impediment cannot be reintroduced in the case as a

separate ground of decision.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But even if it is,

5

logically anterior to consideration of that

6

procedural impediment is a particular ruling on the

7

merits and the State court didn't make that merits.

8

They thought there was no error.

9

necessary for them to decide whether an error is

It is logically not

10

harmless if they don't think there's an error, and to

11

say that they waive that, that later ground I would

12

have thought would be very surprising.

13

remand these cases for further proceedings not

14

inconsistent with our opinion if there's nothing

15

further to be considered?

16

MR. STEIKER:

Why do we

I think that the concerns

17

for judicial economy in this case would have dictated

18

that if the State court believed that the trial

19

objection was inadequate, it would have rested its

20

decision on that ground to essentially preclude

21

merits review of that Federal constitutional issue.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Otherwise you have a

23

Supreme Court decision that the State court can say,

24

thanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but

25

we -- there was a procedural default here.
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Although

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

we bypassed it the first time, we're not going to

2

bypass it after the Supreme Court has told us what

3

the Federal law is.

4

MR. STEIKER:

I think it's a special risk

5

in State habeas when the -

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it would be a

7

special risk if you, if you, if you allowed them to

8

raise the bar, allowed a State to raise a bar to

9

consideration of the issue.

10

But I want to go back to your answer to

11

Justice Stevens' question.

You, you say you draw no

12

distinction between the, the procedural failing as a

13

bar to raising the issue and as a basis for

14

determining a standard of harmless error review

15

later.

16

there is no distinction because if they may not

17

consider it as the basis for their, their standard of

18

harmless error review, assuming we have such a thing,

19

then what are they supposed to use as their standard?

20

Your answer I take it is Chapman, but Chapman as I

21

understand the statement of Federal law would not

22

apply -- State law -- Chapman would not apply in

23

these circumstances.

24

court and this were a Federal conviction Chapman

25

wouldn't apply on collateral review.

I don't understand why you, you can maintain

And if you were in a Federal

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

So it seems to me that you've either got

2

to accept the distinction between procedural error as

3

bar to issue, procedural error as basis for standard

4

of review, or you have no way to figure out what the,

5

what the standard of review should be.

6

MR. STEIKER:

Well, we would take the CCA

7

at its word that the Almanza standard's appropriate.

8

But if the underlying fact of the adequacy of the

9

trial objection has basically been accepted by the

10

State court, we don't believe that on State habeas it

11

could reintroduce the inadequacy of that.

13

I'd like to reserve if I may the remainder
of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. TED CRUZ

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

MR. CRUZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Two postulates govern this case.

First,

22

reconciling Jurek and Johnson and Graham on the one

23

hand and Penry II and Tennard and Smith II on the

24

other hand is not an easy task and State and Federal

25

courts have struggled for two decades to draw the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appropriate lines and to faithfully apply this

2

court's Penry jurisprudence.

3

default rule in both State and Federal court is that

4

most constitutional errors are subject to harmless

5

error review.

Petitioner suggests that the State habeas

8
9

Second, the usual

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I take it that is not an

issue before us?

10

MR. CRUZ:

It is an issue that on the

11

reply brief Petitioner has essentially conceded.

12

footnote 5 Petitioner states that he is not seeking

13

reversal on the basis that Penry error is structural

14

error.

15

Criminal Appeals did to us.

16

In

But that is the issue of what the Court of

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the Penry error, even

17

if not structural, is not subject to harmless error

18

review and you could say that that distinction is

19

possible because Penry has a built-in harmless error

20

or a harmful error component.

21

that's not -- that issue is not in this case.

22

MR. CRUZ:

But as I understand it

It is not in this case because

23

of Petitioner's concession, but Petitioner's

24

concession has serious consequences because the only

25

ground upon which Petitioner can prevail in this
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court is that the State court's application of

2

harmless error violated the United States

3

Constitution and by giving up his structural error

4

argument he gives up virtually any basis to lay out

5

why that would violate the U.S. Constitution, not

6

simply why it was incorrect but why it is

7

unconstitutional for the State court to apply that

8

doctrine.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a question of

10

waiver, part of it.

11

established that, I guess, I mean, if a State waives

12

an adequate State ground by considering the Federal

13

issue, the Federal courts will go into the Federal

14

ground and they can't later, can they -- is there any

15

case you found anywhere -- I haven't found one -

16

where say any Federal court considered a State case

17

where the State went into the Federal issue, the

18

State had said nothing about a State ground, and then

19

after the Federal court's decided it somehow the

20

State got a hold of it again and they this time said,

21

oh dear, we forgot, we forgot; in fact, there is the

22

State ground here.

23

found like that which says that was permissible?

24
25

I mean, that's -- it's well

And is there any case that you

disagree with you.

case and therefore this would be the first.

3
4

Okay, there's no such

MR. CRUZ:

But that's not what happened

here.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. CRUZ:

Right.

I do not disagree with you that

7

if the State court had concluded for Petitioner on a

8

State ground TO begin with and after being reversed

9

revisited that conclusion -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

I'm saying

11

the State typically decides against the defendant.

12

They decide against the defendant on a Federal issue.

13

There's a perfectly adequate State issue.

14

called failure to object, and they don't mention it.

15

I'd be repeating myself.

16

my -- and I'm saying is there any case you found

17

anywhere which says after that occurred that the

18

State when it gets a hold of the case again can say,

19

oh dear, we forgot, there's also this adequate State

20

ground, bad luck?

21

doubt that you have.

22

MR. CRUZ:

23

Are you following what my,

I've never seen such a thing.

I

Justice Breyer, there is no

suggestion -

And I say this would be

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. CRUZ:

That's not what happened here

2

and so we are not urging that ground to support what

3

the Court of Criminal Appeals did.

4

Justice suggested, the Almanza standard, the State

5

harmless error standard, is a two-step inquiry.

6

Inquiry number one, is there error; and under State

7

law if you conclude no the analysis ends.

concluded there is no constitutional error and so it

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm making a mistake

act of charity.

15

contemporaneous objection or proper one, you don't

16

get any appeal normally.

17

you can show egregious harm.

18

I thought that the reason they bring in the

That is, since there was no

MR. CRUZ:

But we'll let you do it if
I'm wrong about that?

That is not exactly how the

19

State court and State law does it.

20

law does and our position in this case is that

21

Petitioner failed to preserve his objection because

22

he did not object specifically on the grounds -

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What the State

Yes, but Mr. Cruz, is it

24

not true that if he did fail to preserve the

25

objection then there should have been a procedural
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

bar to the case going forward?

2

MR. CRUZ:

3

There is not a procedural bar

--

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

MR. CRUZ:

Why is that?

-- because the State Court of

6

Criminal Appeals has chosen to forgive failure to

7

preserve for purposes of procedural default and

8

subsequent habeas rights.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In other words, they are

10

saying that the failure to object does not

11

constitute -- would constitute a procedural bar if we

12

elected to treat it that way, but we've decided not

13

to, but we're nevertheless going to rely on the

14

failure to object to justify a higher standard of

15

review on harmless error?

16
17

MR. CRUZ:

That's exactly correct, Justice

Stevens.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is there any precedent

19

for that ambivalent use of a potential procedural

20

bar?

21

MR. CRUZ:

Let me suggest it's not an

22

ambivalent use, but rather what the Court of Criminal

23

Appeals has held, in the Black case it held that

24

Penry I was so novel that the State courts would

25

excuse a failure to preserve for purposes of
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

procedural bar.

2

more forgiving to defendant than the Federal courts

3

are.

4

So in this regard the State court is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Cruz, none of

5

this went on in the opinion and there were four

6

judges of that court who said there's a procedural

7

bar here, end of case.

8

why they weren't going along with that.

9

anything in the majority opinion that said, well,

The majority never explained
I didn't see

10

never mind that there's a procedural bar here, we're

11

going to deal with the Federal question.

12

MR. CRUZ:

Justice Ginsburg, you're right

13

that in Smith I, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the

14

majority did not explain why there wasn't a

15

procedural bar.

16

cases where the CCA had decided Penry errors were not

17

going to bar access to the courthouse, and just last

18

week in another decision that was decided after

19

briefing in the case, in the In Re Hood case, the

20

Court of Criminal Appeals made clear that in its

21

judgment Penry II was also so novel that for purposes

22

of successive risk it would excuse a failure to

23

preserve.

24
25

But there had been a long line of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The simple

question is the procedural objection, as the four
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judges suggested, could have precluded consideration

2

of the Federal claim at all.

3

MR. CRUZ:

Correct.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the court said

5

we're going to go ahead and consider it, and then

6

when it turns out that they got it wrong and there

7

was error they had to apply harmless error review.

8

In Texas law, harmless error review turns on the

9

standard whether there was an objection or not, and

10

they went back and said there was no objection.

The

11

contrary assertions assumes that when they let the

12

claim go forward, that they were waiving any reliance

13

on objection for any purposes, not consideration on

14

the merits, but also for any eventual later

15

consideration on harmless error pursuant to the

16

established State standard.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Cruz, would you

18

clarify one thing for me?

19

Appeals say in effect, there is a procedural bar but

20

we're going to waive it, or did they just not address

21

the issue?

22
23

MR. CRUZ:

Did the Texas Court of

MR. CRUZ:

In this case they didn't 34

they didn't say because longstanding CCA

2

precedent made clear that -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, you're assuming

there's longstanding precedents.

5

conceivable that at the time they thought the

6

objection was properly preserved.

7

MR. CRUZ:

It is also at least

It is conceivable, but I would

8

suggest the more reasonable inference is they

9

followed their long line of precedents that said

10

we're not going to interpose, as the Chief Justice

11

suggests, a total bar to raising these claims.

12

for procedural default and for successive writs,

13

we're not going to penalize Petitioners for failing

14

to make objections.

16

that respect does not mean that they also need to

17

apply the lesser standard of -

So

Just because the State court

19

they decided to be more lenient rather than assuming

20

that they may have actually decided and rejected the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

something like this:

that failure to object is a procedural bar but that

MR. CRUZ:

The most reasonable explanation

17

for that, Justice Souter, I would suggest is at the

18

time of Smith III the Court had not decided Hood,

19

which means it had not concluded that Penry II was

20

also so novel that it would forgive failure to raise

it.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't the consequence of

that, though, that for purposes of this case there

was no clear State bar at the time in question and

if on remand the Court of Criminal Appeals had

applied procedural default and refused to consider

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But what it is

10

doing is in effect saying there was a kind of default

11

which is subsumed in what the four dissenting

12

justices said the first time around.

13

going to, we're going to sort of call it a half-loaf

Respectfully, they are

altogether separate concepts that procedural default

is a total bar to the courthouse.

they would be separate concepts if there were a rule

it's unconstitutional as applied to my client, give

me one example in Texas law where that was raised and

MR. CRUZ:

That is not -

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. CRUZ:

What is the argument?

The argument is that he made a

7

different objection, a substantively different

8

objection, because what he filed was an argument that

9

the Texas death penalty was unconstitutional on its

10

face across the board and as applied to him, and he

11

made a conscious strategic choice which is, when the

12

judge presented a charge to the counsel and said do

13

you have any objections, do you have any suggestions,

14

is there any way I can change it, he could have done

15

what Penry's counsel did.

asked the judge, please instruct the jury on

deliberateness so they can consider my mitigating

the counsel for the defendant did one other thing,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. CRUZ:

Yes.

Really?
For two reasons.

Number

one, because Penry I, which has already been decided,

MR. CRUZ:

That's what the Court of

18

deliberateness instruction or a catch-all

19

instruction.

20

Court and the State court have said judges can give

an instruction.

22

So -- but in both cases, both this

And Penry I's counsel made -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is your instruction -

23

I think this is of some importance.

24

in this case is that the judge as well as counsel

25

thought that the judge couldn't say in essence what
41
Alderson Reporting Company

My understanding

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

became the Texas law because the legislature put it

2

in, which is:

3

you can consider all the mitigating evidence and it's

4

up to you if you think that mitigating evidence is

5

enough to have a life rather than a death sentence.

6

That I thought the judge couldn't do.

7

seen a prelegislative change, charge in Texas that

8

says what the legislature provided.

9

Jury, is it two special issues, but

MR. CRUZ:

I have not

Justice Ginsburg, that is in

10

fact what the judge did here.

What the judge could

11

do clearly under Texas law is give any reasonable

12

instruction to cure the error.

13

couldn't do is submit a third special issue.

14

couldn't ask the jury, check, is there enough

15

mitigating evidence to sentence to death.

So it

16

couldn't change the output from the jury.

It

17

couldn't add a new special issue but it could give

18

any instruction possible to correct the error.

19

was Texas law, that you could give instructions, but

20

the special issues are set by statute.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What the judge
It

That

And so the jury, what

22

they take into the jury room is something that says

23

these are the two questions that you must answer.

24
25

MR. CRUZ:

But they also have a written

charge, so they get a written charge with the
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

instruction.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Which tells them that

3

the only way that they can give effect to mitigating

4

evidence is if they answer one of those questions

5

falsely.

6

MR. CRUZ:

But this Court said in both

7

Penry I and Penry II that if the trial judge defined

8

deliberateness appropriately, even under the old

9

special issues, that it could solve the problem.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in this case the

11

judge said I'm going to give the nullification

12

instruction, and the attorney said, and I think quite

13

properly, he said that won't work.

14

MR. CRUZ:

But what the attorney -- the

15

attorney didn't say that won't work because it puts

16

jurors in an ethical quandary, it causes them to

17

violate the oath.

18

give no instructions.

19

strategic choice is that Smith's counsel made the

20

judgment, I want it to be impossible for my client to

21

be subject to the death penalty.

22

What the attorney said is, you can
And the reason for that

Had Smith's counsel made the same

23

objection that Penry made, had he read Penry right in

24

front of him and asked, give me a deliberateness

instruction, it would have cured the error.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

But the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason I would suggest that Smith's counsel didn't is

2

that the quantum of mitigating evidence in this case

3

was so slight compared to the pervious cases that he

made a very conscious strategic choice, I'd rather go

5

all or nothing.

there is -

I would rather make an argument that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENE C. SCHAERR

3

ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA, ET AL.,

4

AS AMICI CURIAE SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. SCHAERR:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

7

I represent California and 20 other states

8

who are concerned about the implications of

9

Petitioner's arguments for their ability to apply

10

their own varied harmless error standards in their

11

own State habeas proceedings, and thereby to strike

12

what they believe to be the right balance between the

13

two competing concerns that this Court identified in

14

Calderon.

15

retrial or resentencing, and the other the desire to

16

ensure that the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus

17

is available to those whom society has grievously

18

wronged.

19

One being the significant social costs of

And with those concerns in mind, I'd like

20

to address three specific points.

The first is the

21

whole question of whether States have the ability

22

under our Federal Constitution to choose their own

23

harmless error standards even when they are

24

addressing Federal error.

25

concede as a general matter that States do have that

Petitioner appears to

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority, but let me just briefly indicate why that

2

concession is well founded.

3
4
5

First of all, as this Court has held in
Pennsylvania versus Finley JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you talking about

6

both collateral review and direct review, or just

7

collateral review?

8
9
10

MR. SCHAERR:

I'm just talking about

collateral review right now.
As this Court has held in Pennsylvania

11

versus Finley, the States are under no obligation to

12

provide collateral review at all, and so it would be

13

extraordinary if they take the step of deciding that

14

they will provide such review, for this Court to say,

15

well, if you're going to do that you have to apply a

16

Federal standard on State habeas review rather than

17

the standard that you choose.

18

Secondly, to the extent the States decide

19

to provide habeas review or any other kind of

20

post-conviction review, the authority by which they

21

do that derives from State law, not from the Federal

22

Constitution or any other Federal law, and this Court

23

obviously does not have general supervisory authority

24

over, over State courts as it does Federal courts.

25

And third, unlike the situation with
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

direct review, this Court could not as a practical

2

matter impose a Federal standard on State habeas

3

proceedings without being highly intrusive.

4

--

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

In, in this case suppose

6

the following circumstance.

has decided in the case of this defendant -

Suppose a Federal court

Right.
-- there was an error of

10

Federal constitutional law, search and seizure or

11

confessions or something, and now we send it back.

12

And let's suppose further the State has no

13

independent State ground, they are not trying to make

14

the argument, whether or not they're trying to make

15

it here.

16

objection to problem, nothing.

17

standard that could be applied is the structural

18

error standard.

19

standard.

20

perhaps my ignorance -- -that's whey want you to show

21

me -- where it's definitively established by a

22

Federal court anyway that there was a serious Federal

23

error, I've never seen a case where this Court said,

24

or I can't recall one, that the State applied yet

25

some third kind of standard, such as, well, I know

There's no independent State ground, no
Now, I read that one

A second is a harmless error

But I've never seen a case, but that's

49
Alderson Reporting Company

there was a very important error, I know it was

2

Federal and constitutional, but nonetheless we're not

3

going to give them any remedy unless it's absolutely

4

egregious harm.

5
6

I've never seen that in the law.

Now, can you point to me in the law where,
which will correct my lacuna?

7

MR. SCHAERR:

I'm not aware that the Court

8

has expressly addressed that precise question, which

9

I think is -

JUSTICE BREYER:

Have you ever seen a State which gets a

13

MR. SCHAERR:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Where?

Where should I

look on that?
MR. SCHAERR:

18

which States have addressed Federal -

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

I'm not talking

20

about that because obviously they can do what they

21

want, I think, in the State courts, but they might

22

violate Federal law if they do it.

7

MR. SCHAERR:

I guess the reason would

12

racially discriminatory way, suppose there are all

13

kinds of things, the State says, well, we admit, we

I have not heard of a

whether the State is free in that circumstance to

ground the States are routinely applying State

Official - Subject to Final Review

it would be a sea change if this Court were to now

hold that, no, when a State court is reviewing the

apply a Federal standard rather than the State.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there any special

have to.

25

apply them -

I mean, they may under State law have to

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In other words, if for

2

example the higher standard only applies to

3

unpreserved error and the record clearly establishes

4

and the several State judges confirm there was no

5

unpreserved error, then would there not be a duty to

6

apply the lower standard?

7

MR. SCHAERR:

There may be under State

8

law, it's not clear why that would raise a Federal

9

issue.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if the State follows

11

the rule in just one exceptional case before the

12

Federal court, can the court said, hey, you're not

13

following your regular rule?

14

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, there may be a due

15

process objection to that, but here the only

16

objection -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there no Federal

18

interest in ensuring that there is a full and fair

19

implementation of a Federal right?

20

higher standard is erroneously applied, doesn't that

21

prejudice the Federal right?

22
23
24
25

MR. SCHAERR:

And if the State

Well, that may be one reason

why we have Federal habeas proceedings.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that reason would

apply equally, however, to determinations of Federal
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rights by State courts.

2

MR. SCHAERR:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.
And I think everybody

4

understands that State courts do this all the time,

5

and indeed a good way to do an end run around what,

6

what, what the other side in this case seems to want

7

is simply for the State supreme court to find a

8

violation of Federal law so that it doesn't get to a

9

Federal court and then have the State lower court

10

apply whatever harmless error standard it wishes,

11

which would be a crazy system.

12

MR. SCHAERR:

That's right.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So if you're going to

14

adopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted

15

not only for references back to the State court from

16

a Federal decision, but you would surely have to

17

apply it to all State determinations of Federal law,

18

and I don't really know what authority we would have

19

to require lower State courts to do that.

20

MR. SCHAERR:

Well, that's, that's exactly

21

right and especially in the habeas context it would

22

be, it would be extremely intrusive and invasive for

23

this Court to attempt to do that.

24

direct review of a State criminal conviction to say

25

as a matter of Federal constitutional law we think

It's one thing on

after the conviction is final and the defendant is

already incarcerated, then on a State habeas

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN STEIKER

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. STEIKER:

I'd like to return to the

17

record in this case because I think once it's

18

clarified what the nature of the evidence was in this

19

case it's clear that this Court could find that the

20

error was harmful under any standard, including the

21

egregious harm standard.

22

200 pages of exhibits documenting a lifelong

23

disability.

24

the guilt-innocence phase of the trial.

25

argued at the guilt-innocence closing argument, in

We have in this case over

This evidence was first introduced in

56
Alderson Reporting Company

It was

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which trial counsel said, this is a 19-year-old ninth

2

grader who has been charged with this crime, and

3

argued that that was the basis for considering him

4

less culpable than his college-educated co-defendant.

5

During the punishment phase, it's clear

6

that the single most important witness, the one whose

7

testimony was the most central, the most

8

time-consuming, was Alberta Pingle, who brought in

9

all of the school records showing from at the time

10

the Petitioner was in school he had been diagnosed as

11

a learning disabled, possibly organic in nature, 78

12

IQ.

13

basis for withholding a death sentence.

14

this man has a 78 IQ, 8 points from being mentally

15

retarded, lifelong learning disabilities, possibly

16

organic in nature.

17

And his counsel emphasized this as the central
He said,

And the argument that there was no

18

evidence of abuse in this case is belied by the fact

19

that the evidence showed that Petitioner's father

20

chased him with a butcher knife in order to steel the

21

family's car in order to support his crack habit.

22

that's not evidence of abuse and evidence that could

23

show reduced culpability for this defendant, coupled

24

especially with his impairment which made him less

25

capable of responding to that role model and avoiding

dangerous behavior CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about

3

General, Mr. Cruz's comments that this was a minor

4

point in counsel's summation before the jury?

5

MR. STEIKER:

It is true that this

6

evidence was presented as only one page of his

7

closing argument, but that was because of the problem

8

in this case.

9

reversal, the prosecutor got up right before defense

As this Court noted in its summary

10

counsel and said:

11

would answer the special issues honestly and that if

12

the evidence supported a yes answer to deliberateness

13

and dangerousness you would give us yes answers.

14

Basically, right before he spoke the prosecutor gave

15

an anti-nullification instruction which said this

16

evidence isn't relevant to the special issues of

17

deliberateness and dangerousness.

18

You promised us on voir dire you

In that posture, he was left to argue that

19

the evidence showed he wasn't dangerous, that the

20

evidence showed he didn't act deliberately, and just

21

hope that the jury would be willing to lie on the

22

special verdict form.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this argument

24

an assertion that the Texas State court was wrong in

25

its determination of this question of Texas State

MR. STEIKER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

His argument No, your argument

right now.
MR. STEIKER:

I'm sorry.

I don't

understand.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is your argument

8

an argument that the Texas State court was wrong on

9

its ruling under Texas State law harmless error.

10

MR. STEIKER:

No.

Our argument is that

11

when you take out the clearly impermissible Federal

12

conclusion that the jury could give effect to this

13

evidence, which was exactly what this Court said to

14

the contrary in its summary reversal -- this Court

15

said this evidence couldn't be considered.

16

court said he has extensive evidence, he has powerful

17

evidence, powerfully presented, dramatically

18

presented, but we think, unlike the Supreme Court,

19

that a carefully crafted nullification instruction

20

will facilitate the jurors' consideration of it.

21

So if you take away the impermissible

The State

22

Federal conclusion, this Court could clearly

23

conceive, conclude, on the basis of the State court's

24

own characterization of this evidence, which departs

25

tremendously from the Respondent's view, that this
59
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

was powerful mitigating evidence.

2

Criminal Appeals' error was to conclude that this

3

could be taken into account after this Court said

4

exactly the opposite.
