ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The per se illegality rule for resale price

11

maintenance is widely recognized to be outdated,

12

misguided and anticompetitive.

13

with the same rule of reason standard that applies to

14

other forms of vertically imposed marketing

15

restrictions.

16

It should be replaced

The Sherman Act bars only unreasonable

17

restraints of trade and the court presumptively applies

18

a rule of reason analysis to determine whether a

19

restraint is unreasonable.

20

Per se rules should be rare and imposed only

21

where the court is virtually certain based upon

22

considerable economic experience that a practice is

23

nearly invariably anticompetitive.

24

retail -- resale price maintenance are plainly not

25

invariably anticompetitive.

Vertical minimum

In fact, a broad consensus
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of economists and decisions of this Court recognize that

2

vertical restraints promote interbrand competition,

3

which is the goal of the antitrust laws and are rarely,

4

if ever, anticompetitive.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was an argument

6

made, Mr. Olson, that it is somewhat difficult to

7

distinguish vertical from horizontal in this context,

8

that in fact, the agreement that the manufacturer made

9

with the dealers was more successful in getting a

10

horizontal accord among the dealers than if the dealers

11

had attempted it themselves, in which case some might

12

have held back.

13

MR. OLSON:

Well, the economists who have

14

looked at the use of resale price maintenance have said

15

that that would very rarely, if ever, be the case.

16

certainly could not be the case in this industry in

17

connection with this participant in the marketplace.

18

There are something like 5,000 dealers that the Brighton

19

products are sold through.

20

thousands of other competing dealers, hundreds of

21

products.

22

There are thousands and

What the Court has said repeatedly is that

23

programs such as this may promote interbrand

24

competition, perhaps -

25

It

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Olson, suppose just

Alderson Reporting Company

the dealers in New York, the retail dealers agreed among

2

themselves on the price.

3
4
5
6
7

MR. OLSON:

Would that be lawful?
No.

I think that that would be

covered by a horizontal prohibition, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Would you say that it's

per se unlawful?
MR. OLSON:

I think it would be, as

8

horizontal restraint among competing dealers, it could

9

be a per se violation under horizontal rules if it was

10

-- if it was -- involved the manufacturer in some way,

11

it could be dealt with by the rule of reason.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Why should that be any

13

different from the arrangement where those dealers all

14

got together in the convention and recommended to the

15

manufacturer that he impose a vertical restraint of

16

precisely the same dimensions?

17

MR. OLSON:

Why -

What this Court said in

18

Sylvania, and said again in the State Oil versus Khan,

19

is that the manufacturer has very, very little incentive

20

to increase -

21
22
23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but I'm asking what if

he did, why should you draw a distinction?
MR. OLSON:

Because the motivation for the

24

arrangement, if it comes from a manufacturer -- you're

25

suggesting a hypothetical in which all of the dealers in
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a particular area would get together to impose this on a

2

manufacturer.

3

would happen.

4

I think it's very unrealistic that that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No.

They just passed a

5

resolution asking the manufacturer to impose this

6

vertical restraint and ways to do it.

7

different from one in which the manufacturer does it

8

independently?

9

MR. OLSON:

Should that be

I think that if the manufacturer

10

makes a decision, whether it's because dealers would

11

like to see that happen or not, as this Court said in

12

Business Electronic versus Sharp Electronics, there's of

13

course relationships between the dealers and the

14

manufacturers, that the dealers may have an interest in

15

doing this, because they may find for the same reason

16

that the manufacturer does that it promotes the sales of

17

products.

18

was an effective strategy for the Brighton company, the

19

Brighton Leegin company that's manufacturing the

20

Brighton products, to enter a very difficult and highly

21

competitive marketplace, and it was successful.

22

The record is clear in this case that this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Maybe, Mr. Olson,

23

you could give us an example where the rule of reason

24

would find a violation in this situation?

25

MR. OLSON:

Well, it might be a situation,
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the economists have written about this, say that it

2

would be very rare, and would require retailers with a

3

strong powerful market power to impose a situation where

4

the manufacturer would do that to help facilitate a

5

horizontal cartel.

6

this case, and that would probably be found to violate

7

the rule of reason.

8

unlawful under the horizontal rules established by this

9

Court.

10

That certainly was not involved in

In addition, it would probably be

That was not an issue in this case.

The

economists say that that would very seldom happen.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You say very.

5

differently.

There are other whose think

So how should we decide this?

6

MR. OLSON:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Now that's one

Well Should we overturn

Dr. Miles and run that risk?

9

MR. OLSON:

In, in the vast majority of the

10

economist whose have looked at this have come out to the

11

opposite conclusion, Justice Breyer.

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Secondly -

We're supposed to count

economists?

14

MR. OLSON:

No. No. I think that -

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. OLSON:

Is that how we decide it?

But what this Court -- what this

18

Court has repeatedly said, that under circumstances such

19

as this where there's a consensus among leading

20

respected economists, that is one factor.

21

another factor -

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I haven't seen a

23

consensus.

24

these people, doesn't that point of view count, too?

25

A consensus?

There's

MR. OLSON:

Isn't, doesn't Sherer and all

This is one factor that the
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court should consider and the Court has considered in

2

the past when dealing with something that the Court

3

itself has said, is an anachronistic and chronologically

4

schizoid rule, to have a rule of reason for certain

5

vertical restraints and a fixed, rigid, per se rule with

6

respect to other vertical restraints.

7

Court itself has made those pronouncements.

8
9

The Court -- the

The enforcing agencies have changed their
view with respect -- and they are here today, the

10

Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, all

11

of whom have announced that they believe that it is very

12

rare for a rule such as this, for an arrangement such as

13

this to be anticompetitive.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it was not so long

15

ago that the Department of Justice took a different

16

view.

17

the only one where Congress has been a player.

18

Congress allowed the fair trade laws to operate.

19

then it withdrew that.

20

they are has been congressional action, where the

21

argument could be made, well, Congress is well aware of

22

this, the Court should allow them to make the change, if

23

they so will.

24
25

And of all of the vertical restraints, this is

MR. OLSON:

I mean,
And

There's no other restraint where

Essentially, the same argument

was made in the Sylvania -- at the time of the Sylvania

case.

The same argument was made just a term or two go

2

in connection with the Illinois Tool case that dealt

3

with tying arrangements.

4

State Oil versus Khan.

5

antitrust laws as an expression by Congress that the

6

courts should be aware of the dynamic potential in the

7

marketplace -

8
9

The same argument was made in
This Court has construed the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in those cases you

didn't have the counterpart to Miller-Tydings and

10

McGuire.

11

in terms of congressional intention.

12

That's what makes this -- this one different

MR. OLSON:

The repeal of those statutes,

13

Justice Ginsburg, repealed per se legality rules.

14

was not a congressional expression against the rule of

15

reason -

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It

No, but there was in the

17

patent case, though, Mr. Olson.

18

that the patent law changed.

We relied on the fact

19

MR. OLSON:

Yes, you did.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

MR. OLSON:

22

factor, however, Justice Stevens.

23

that opinion, the Court was also concerned with the fact

24

that the, the per se rule which -- and the Court said

25

the statement thing just a few weeks ago in the

Yes.

And that was a, that was one
I think, as I read

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Weyerhaeuser case -- to the extent there's practices

2

that can be procompetitive, the Court should not set a

3

low threshold of illegality, especially low per se

4

illegality threshold.

5

it is worth emphasizing that the Court has repeatedly

6

said we don't want per se rules when we don't have a

7

substantial body of economic experience that shows us

8

that this practice -

9

There were -- there have been -

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about -- what

10

about the reliance interest, though?

11

whole industry of discount stores developed in reliance

12

on the Dr. Miles rule?

13

concerned about the disruption to that established

14

practice?

15

MR. OLSON:

I mean, hasn't a

And don't we need to be

There's really no evidence that

16

the marketplace as it exists today is a result of the

17

Dr. Miles rule of 1911, Chief Justice -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't there evidence that

19

the, basically that the rise of the Wal-Marts and the

20

Targets is correlated with the demise of fair trade?

21

So -- that there's that correlation.

22

MR. OLSON:

Actually I looked into that,

23

Justice Souter.

And me, my limited historical research

24

is that the -- those discounters were coming on strong

25

before 1975 which is when the, the consumer price,
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

whatever it was, act was passed in response to that.

2

There are -- the evidence basically shows

3

that -- and this Court has said -- that it's interbrand

4

competition that ultimately produces lower prices.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I don't know.

We

6

have -- you talked about -- just for fun I got out of

7

the library a book by Professor B. S. Yamey, called

8

resale price maintenance where he has five economists -

9

now maybe you're not going to count them as economists.

10

Now I didn't find in that book a single argument that

11

isn't also in your briefs, nor did I find in your brief

12

as single argument that isn't in the book.

13

There's one interesting thing about the

14

book.

It was written in 1966.

15

is what's changed?

16

So I guess my question

Now I know two things have changed.

One is there's evidence in Canada, Britain,

17

and in the states that were under Miller-Tydings, that

18

when you got rid of resale price maintenance, prices

19

went down.

20

changed is there's far more concentration, I gather,

21

today in the retail side of the market than there are

22

used to be, a factor which makes resale price

23

maintenance dangerous because it's more likely to take

24

place at the request of the dealers.

25

That's changed.

And the second thing that's

Now, I see those two changes.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

My question

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to you is looking at Yamey's book which is called Resale

2

Price Maintenance, so you might have found even it even

3

on Google, and --

4

what's changed?

MR. OLSON:

What's new?

Well, a number of things have

5

changed.

The -- the number of respected individuals,

6

notwithstanding that book, who have looked at it and

7

have focused on the marketplace, have said that because

8

it allows -- it increases the possibility of interbrand

9

competition, it can provide incentives for dealers to

10

provide service, differences in the products.

11

things that have happened since then, are this Court's

12

decision in the Sylvania case, which -- which involved

13

an elaborate analysis of vertical restrictions and found

14

that they are largely procompetitive and undermine the

15

ruling -- the reason for a per se rule.

16

And other

This Court's decision in State Oil versus

17

Khan, and the other cases that this Court is very well

18

aware of where per se rules have systematically been

19

dismantled because they are artificial themselves in the

20

marketplace.

21

This -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Olson, does brand

22

competition generally help retailers, or is this a

23

question that can't be answered?

24

MR. OLSON:

Did you say inter -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Interbrand, interbrand

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

competition?

2

Do retailers like interbrand competition?

MR. OLSON:

Well, I don't know that -- I

3

don't know whether people like competition.

4

antitrust laws like competition and this Court likes

5

competition.

6

But the

And this Court has said that interbrand -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but we're talking

7

about inter -- we're talking about retailers.

It, it

8

seems to me at the outset of the argument, you -- you

9

acknowledged, and I think it is the general rule -- that

10

if the retailers themselves have this resale price

11

maintenance, it is invalid.

12

does this just for the convenience of the retailers, and

13

that's -- many of the examples in your brief, it is for

14

the convenience and for the benefit of the retailers,

15

then why shouldn't there be a per se rule?

16

we allow the manufacturer to do something we that

17

wouldn't allow the retailers to do, if it's for the

18

retailers?

19

MR. OLSON:

Well, if the manufacturer

Why should

Well, the manufacturer is very

20

unlikely to do this for the convenience of the

21

retailers, to -- because it's in the interest of the

22

manufacturer to have the retail price as low as possible

23

so that the manufacturer will sell as many of the

24

manufacturers' products as possible.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if, if indeed that's,

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that's what he's aiming at, low price.

2

of the -- is the sole object of the Sherman Act to

3

produce low prices?

4

MR. OLSON:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

No.
I thought it was consumer

welfare.

7

MR. OLSON:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

Is it the object

Yes, yes, it is.
And I thought some

consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.

10

MR. OLSON:

Precisely.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So the mere fact that it

12

would increase prices doesn't prove anything.

13

doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare.

14

in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more

15

service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance

16

consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive

17

products at a lower price, wouldn't it?

18
19
20

MR. OLSON:

It
If,

That's -- that's absolutely

correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I don't know why, why we

21

should have to focus our entire attention on whether

22

it's going to -- going to produce higher prices or not.

23

The market out there has different goods at different

24

prices which have different qualities that attract

25

different consumers.

MR. OLSON:

I -- I agree completely.

I

2

would like to reserve the balance of my time for

3

rebuttal, but let me say that that's what this Court has

4

said over and over again.

5

antitrust laws is not price, but it's competition,

6

because competition between competing manufacturers give

7

the consumers more choice.

8

9

that's more available to them.

If you -- the purpose of the

policy or the warranty policy or the repair policy that

the dealer provides.

12

particularly, that system of providing competition is

13

consistent with the antitrust laws and has produced

14

success in the marketplace.

15

And in this marketplace

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, before you sit

16

down, there's just one thing that wasn't covered in your

17

argument or in the brief, but the complaint alleged in

18

this case that Leegin allowed certain favored dealers to

19

discount; this plaintiff, but others were allowed to

20

discount.

21

then that would be a -- a plain violation of antitrust

22

law, wouldn't it?

23

And if that were true, as a matter of fact,

MR. OLSON:

This -- but the case was never

24

litigated on that basis.

It wasn't considered on that

25

basis in the Court of Appeals.

It came up sort of as a

those three sets of things require a balance.

considerations, and they've come out one way.

out the other way.

Now, the

There are good arguments on both sides.

Why

10

should we overrule a case that's 96 years old, in the

11

absence of any -- any -- congressional indication that

12

that's a good idea, when it's simply a question in a

13

difficult area of people reaching a slightly different

14

weight on some these three sets of things?

15

MR. HUNGAR:

Several reasons, Your Honor.

16

It's not -- it's not a close question whether this Court

17

under its modern antitrust jurisprudence as an initial

18

matter would impose a per se rule in this context.

19

There is economic -- there is consensus among the

20

respected economists -

21

I would think it is quite a

close question.

MR. HUNGAR:

Given that this Court's test,

12

In Monsanto and Business Electronics,

this Court made clear that price vertical restraints,

like minimum resale price maintenance, frequently, in

fact usually, have the same or similar effects to the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

better serving the public and they all agree that they

have to be conscious about the competition from other

10
11

Why can we be absolutely certain that's always

going to be harmful to the consumer?
MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, the reason why we

know that is always or almost always harmful is that the

incentive at a horizontal level of a retailer cartel,

just like the incentives of the participants in a

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They might be precisely

the statement as the manufacturers:

MR. HUNGAR:

We think we'll make

No, Your Honor, because the

21

manufacturer's incentive is not to increase the profits

of the retailers, but the retailers when they get

together obviously have a very different incentive,

Congress, which is in a position to know more about

5

where the shot is going to land than we are?

6

MR. HUNGAR:

This Court -- I'm sorry.

7

There's no empirical evidence that I'm aware of about

8

what impact eliminating Dr. Miles would have on the

9

Wal-Marts of the world.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's my point.

But it

11

seems to me there is a body of some empirical evidence

12

that the success of the Wal-Marts and the Targets and

13

the Home Depots was a success which was correlated with

14

the elimination of price maintenance by the States.

15

MR. HUNGAR:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

16

In fact, as Mr. Olson pointed out, the K-Marts of the

Yes, Your Honor, but I think

considerations likes the opening up of international

trade and the development of markets like China to

Remember, it's perfectly legal under current

that somehow this is going to revolutionize the economy

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the suggestion

Well then, what's

8

the great benefit then in changing the rule if it's

perfectly legal to achieve the same result already?

10

MR. HUNGAR:

As the Ping amicus brief, the

11

12

extremely expensive and inefficient to follow the

13

Colgate regime, that for those manufacturers for whom

14

resale price maintenance would be in effect a strategy

15

like Leegin it's more efficient to do it in many

circumstances by agreement, rather than the disruption

that is entailed when you terminate a dealer without

18

further discussion for discounting one item in order to

19

keep your policy in place.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But doesn't that answer

your argument that there isn't reason to believe that

there is going to be disruption if Dr. Miles goes,

5

just -- there's just no basis for these assertions that

6

somehow the economy is going to be massively changed.

are circumstances in which it is more efficient for a

manufacturer to adopt resale price maintenance.

enhance its ability to compete and it will provide

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If the rule of reason is

6

the one that applies, I gathered, perhaps incorrectly,

7

from Mr. Olson's remarks that this would be -- this case

8

would be thrown out on summary judgment, it would never

9

get to trial.

How do you think the rule of reason would

10

operate if it were the rubric under which this case were

11

to be decided?

12

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, I think it would

13

operate as it does usually, which is the plaintiff would

14

be required to establish an anticompetitive effect

15

resulting from the challenged conduct, and once that

16

burden is overcome the defendant would be required to

17

come up with some legitimate business justification,

some pro-competitive results that outweigh that.

The only economic doubt is whether there are

Ping brief that was referenced earlier made a point that

it made, the prices may be -- resale price -- the

21

current Dr. Miles rule may result in increased prices

22

because of the inefficiencies for those retailers, or of

23

those manufacturers who want to establish a regime where

something other than price is important, and they have

to do that unilaterally, which increases inefficiencies.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, Your Honor, I would

would not decrease the inefficiencies of the Colgate

5

maintenance in order to avoid even a rule of reasoned

6

approach, they would have to go -

7

If they want to impose resale price

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even with the tremendous

8

anomaly that the employer -- that the -- the

9

manufacturer cannot do this by agreement, but he can do

10

it just unilaterally and terminate any dealers that

11

won't go along?

12

Colgate seems to say you can achieve the same end but

13

we're not going to let you do it by agreement, you have

14

to do it on your own, and then you have to do the

draconian thing of terminating the dealer.

Those two are substitute of each other.

MR. COYKENDALL:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There you're striking

MR. COYKENDALL:

that would prohibit the efficient dealer from passing on

6

those efficiencies to its consumers.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

18

ON BEHALF OF NEW YORK AS AMICUS CURIAE

19

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

20
21
22

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
When a manufacturer agrees with its

23

retailers to fix a minimum resale price, the whole point

24

of the agreement is to prevent price competition among

25

retailers, to prevent discounts.

For almost 100 years

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Court has interpreted Section 1 of the Sherman Act

2

to prohibit such price fixing agreements.

3

that fundamental understanding of the statute should be

4

made by Congress and not by this Court.

5

Any change in

The per se rule against resale price

6

maintenance is different in at least three ways from

7

other antitrust rules that this Court has overturned.

8

First, unlike the other rules, it alone has been settled

9

law for a century, reaffirmed over and over again by

10
11

this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's also been

12

settled law for 90 years under the Colgate doctrine that

13

manufacturers can achieve the same results, albeit more

14

inefficiently.

15

adopt the most efficient means to an end that is already

16

completely legal?

17

Doesn't it make sense to allow them to

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No.

That tension that you

18

-- that supposed anomaly that you described is simply a

19

result of the fact that the antitrust rule -- law does

20

not prohibit all anticompetitive behavior.

21

agreements that are anti -- that restrain competition.

It prohibits

22

And so it will often be the case that it is

23

possible for somebody unilaterally to do something that

24

has the same effect as an agreement, or approximately

25

the same effect, as the antitrust law simply draws that
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

line because of a different value, a value in preserving

2

the independent action of individuals.

3

It is, however -

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure it's often the

5

case.

Give me some other examples where you can achieve

6

the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.

7

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, as you have observed,

8

virtually any vertical restriction could be accomplished

9

by having the manufacturer integrate the retailing

10

function and become one entity instead of two entities.

11

Then the possibility of conspiracy or agreement is

12

eliminated and the manufacturer, if he simply integrates

13

the whole function, is -- can fix prices, fix his, what

14

are in effect his own prices and be outside the reach of

15

the antitrust laws.

16

manufacturer might not find it convenient to do that

17

integration, but it is certainly possible by ceasing to

18

be multiple entities and to become one entity to avoid

19

the prohibitions of the antitrust law.

20

There are other reasons why a

It is also -- so, this is old and well

21

settled.

Unlike the Schwinn rule against territorial

22

restraints which was overturned only 10 years after it

23

was established, or the Albrecht rule against maximum

24

resale price maintenance which was overturned 29 years

25

after it was established, this has a much more settled
45
Alderson Reporting Company

pedigree in the law and expectations have grown up

2

around it.

Second, it was endorsed and relied on by

4

5

relied on by Congress, when Congress repealed the fair

6

trade laws in 1975 by amending the very statute this

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Were they relying on

Dr. Miles or were they relying on us?

question.

11

MS. UNDERWOOD:

They were relying -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They left the situation

13

where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as

14

determined by this Court, and we had shown our

15

willingness to update the antitrust law when sound

16

economic doctrine suggests is necessary.

17

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No.

The legislative history

18

described in some detail in the Antitrust Institute's

19

brief shows that actually they were returning the law to

20

the per se rule against resale price maintenance because

21

they thought resale price maintenance was bad and should

22

be prohibited.

23

This is -- it is also true that -

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

But of course, they

could always pass a law saying that if their intent is

2

so clear.

They didn't do that here.
MS. UNDERWOOD:

That's true, they did not do

3

that here and I'm not suggesting that they did, only

4

that, uniquely among the rules that this Court has

5

established in the antitrust area, this rule has

6

received the repeated attention of Congress; and so the

7

Court's deference to Congress and reluctance to overturn

8

the rule should be at its peek as compared with those

9

other rules.

10

And third, price is different.

11

has said that price competition is the central nervous

12

system of the economy.

13

might indirectly affect price, but not with the same

14

absolute force.

15

prevent price competition because customers can travel

16

or order by phone, mail, or Internet, and indeed under

17

territorial restraints there are often multiple

18

retailers in a particular territory who can compete.

have to charge this much and because you have to charge

this much you also have to provide the training, the

19

service, whatever the non-price inducements are.

20

MS. UNDERWOOD:

You could.

You could also

21

require those things without resale price maintenance

and then the retailer would be free to decide to raise

the price to pay for that or to provide it so

24

efficiently that he could in effect engage -

But then the

retailer, but then the retailer might have a real

incentive not to do a good job on the service because

they really want to market it for price, not for

service.

it, on what the consumers in the market want, and if

it's correct, if the manufacturer -- if the claim on
