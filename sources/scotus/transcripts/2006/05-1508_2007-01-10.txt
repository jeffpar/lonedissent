vs. Department of Education.

Mr. Van Amberg.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. VAN AMBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice and may

it please the Court:
In 1994, Congress enacted the equalization

12

formula under the Impact Aid Act.

13

decisively, and described a methodology which was

14

unambiguous, was self contained, reflected a recognized

15

statistical standard, and assisted in actually

16

promulgating -- and -- the intent of the Impact Aid Act,

17

which is to benefit impacted local educational agencies

18

or school districts and not fund the general educational

19

program of the States.

20

It did so clearly and

In so doing, Congress removed from the

21

Secretary the previously delegated authority to

22

establish by regulation the equalization formula.

23

Secretary in turn in 1996, in enacting his regulations

24

in response to the 1994 legislation, disavowed that he

25

was engaging in any rulemaking or in fact in any
3
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

interpretations of statutes.

2

sought and announced that he was proceeding under an

3

exception to the public notice and comment laws,

4

5 U.S.C. 553(b), by stating that his regulations merely

5

reflected changes in legislation, refining regulatory

6

language.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Instead, the Secretary

Mr. Van Amberg, they were

8

essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they

9

not?

10

And those regulations had gone through the notice

and comment process.

11

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Yes.

That is correct,

12

Justice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg.

13

except for a few words here and there, those were the

14

same regulations.

15

congressional directive back in 1974 that the Secretary

16

is to create the equalization formula.

17

Congress came in with legislation and established that

18

formula.

19

Those were essentially,

But they were in response to a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In 1994,

I thought that the

20

formula was proposed to Congress by the Department of

21

Education, which is not something that Congress did in

22

other words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was

23

doing.

24

own language that Congress enacted?

25

But it was indeed -- wasn't it the Secretary's

MR. VAN AMBERG:

The contention is made that
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this 545-page omnibus education bill -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, just as to that,

3

the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you

4

say it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education?

5

MR. VAN AMBERG:

I don't think we know

6

exactly who it was drafted by.

I think there is -

7

there is some references in the Congressional -

8

Congressional Record that this is an administration

9

bill.

But I would, I would like to respond, Justice

10

Ginsburg, based on the assumption that this was the

11

Secretary's bill.

12

Under the statutory formula, the language is

13

clear that what is disregarded in -- in ranking LEAs and

14

eliminating percentiles of LEAs is those LEAs which fall

15

above the 95th percentile -

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before you get into the

17

substance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem,

18

whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill.

19

Was the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94

20

legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the

21

prior regulations?

22

MR. VAN AMBERG:

No.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The prior regulations were

24
25

This -

promulgated when?
MR. VAN AMBERG:

The former regulations were
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

promulgated in 1976.

2
3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

My goodness, that's a long

time before.

4

MR. VAN AMBERG:

That's a long time.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

With a different Secretary

MR. VAN AMBERG:

And a different agency.

6

now.

7
8

There wasn't even -

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So there's no reason to

10

believe that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary

11

continued to have the same view of what was proper, is

12

there?

13

MR. VAN AMBERG:

We view that it did not

14

and, and also, Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, we

15

also view that if this was the chief educational officer

16

of the Federal Government, he was more than capable of

17

developing a statute which reflected his methodology

18

of -

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indeed he could have copied

20

the regulations that were on the book and just put them

21

in the statute, couldn't he?

22

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Well, even in the same act,

23

Your Honor, under when they had the EFIG statute, there

24

Congress was able to reference the regulations of the

25

Secretary.

They didn't do so when they were, when they
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

enacted the impact aid part of it.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -

Well, as -- as far as the

3

difference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the

4

later Secretary's decision to retain, as you

5

acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation.

6

said it didn't go through notice and comment the second

7

time, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in

8

--

9

MR. VAN AMBERG:

You

He didn't -- if I could,

10

Your Honor, he did not retain the second regulation.

11

This was supposed to be a new regulation which was

12

promulgated by the Secretary because the Impact Aid Act

13

had been repealed -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes -

15

MR. VAN AMBERG:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG: -- and I appreciate that.

-- and re-enacted.

17

But the text of it, what the regulation said was not

18

significantly different from what the earlier regulation

19

said.

20

MR. VAN AMBERG:

No.

But it -

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was this the same

22

Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the

23

new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office

24

when the new legislation had been proposed?

25

MR. VAN AMBERG:

The new legislation was
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

'94.

Secretary enacted it in '96.

2

was.

I -- I -- it was the same administration.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it probably

Why, why would the

4

Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he

5

deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula

6

should be?

7

one must think that there must have been some pressures

8

from elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take

9

some power away from me, please.

10

Which is the power he had before.

MR. VAN AMBERG:

I mean,

Well, that, and I would

11

agree, Justice Scalia, that that is not a, a usual event

12

where an administration intentionally disgorges from

13

itself its own authority.

14

out the fact that again, there is a dramatic difference

15

between what, what the statute proposed and, and the

16

methodology described in the regulation.

17

what's very significant is if you go back to 1976 when

18

the original regulation was promulgated, there was a

19

debate that went on in the public notice and comment

20

portion of these proceedings where they discussed

21

whether you eliminate percentile of LEAs directly or

22

whether you add this extra step of eliminating

23

percentage, percentages of pupils and then eliminating

24

LEAs as these pupils are eliminated.

25

And, and I would also point

And what's,

I mean, it's a totally different process,
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

totally different philosophy behind them and as we can

2

see in this particular case, in New Mexico and in

3

Alaska, totally different results.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Van Amberg, is the

5

statutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest?

6

It says above the 95th percentile or below the 5th

7

percentile, but it doesn't say above the 95th percentile

8

of local education agencies or below the 5th percentile

9

of local education agencies, does it?

10

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Well, Justice Alito, I, I

11

think what you, I think it is clear and unambiguous.

12

And the reason is that if you, in order to run a

13

percentile calculation you need units against which to

14

run that, and then you need these, an identified set of

15

variable standards such as they provided here, the

16

average per pupil expenditures of each set of these LEAs

17

or districts.

18

So you rank the, the LEAs.

You've got the

19

variable values and then it, it's, the statute provides

20

that you find that you eliminate those LEAs which are

21

above the 95th percentile.

22

what "such" means and referencing back to other portions

23

of the statute, it's 95th percentile of the revenues and

24

expenditures of the LEAs in the State.

25

similar process for -

And then if you go back to

It's a very

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but what do you

3

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Pardon?

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you distribute?

2

distribute?

5

mean, I agree you have a, some kind of, let's put

6

something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and

7

each one has a number on it.

8

-- the cards?

9

a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution.

10
11
12

What are you distributing

Are you, are you -- what's distribute -

What's it a distribution of?
MR. VAN AMBERG:

It's the distribution of

the percent of the, what is -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it a thing?

14

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Like a thing.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Like a -- like a set of

16
17

things that you're distributing, what are they?
MR. VAN AMBERG:

The thing that you're

18

running the percentile against is the total number of,

19

of expenditures and revenues in the State.

20

I

JUSTICE BREYER:

In other words, you take

21

all the -- there is a set of numbers, each number is a

22

different number and the characteristic of each number

23

is there some school district that spends per, or takes

24

in per pupil, revenue equal to that number.

statistician.

against which -

17

better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.

that you did know what it was.

That's what's

23

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Yes, but -

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry, I don't know how

25

-11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Such revenues or

2

expenditures in the State consist of, the word "such"

3

obviously refers you back to some prior reference to

4

revenues in the State, and that prior reference in

5

subsection A is a reference to district by district, not

6

pupil by pupil.

7

MR. VAN AMBERG:

That, that's correct.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, so in other words we

9

are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers?

10

you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute

11

is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?

12

MR. VAN AMBERG:

If

Well, I'm sorry, Justice -

13

I'm -- Breyer; I'm having a little trouble understanding

14

--

15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I -- I thought not.

Is there a -

17

MR. VAN AMBERG:

-- the question.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You're not certain

19

about the hypothetical but you're certain about the

20

statute, aren't you?

21

MR. VAN AMBERG:

I'm certain about the

22

statute.

You're provided the variable values that are

23

attributed to each of the LEAs; you rank them; and you

24

provide a percentile.

25

described in 1976.

It's a methodology which was

It's a methodology employed every
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

day in ranking students and schools.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah -- that -- right.

But

3

I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so

4

I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you

5

referred to a percentile, you have some group of things,

6

a set of things that's being distributed in a certain

7

order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.

8

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Correct.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if that's what

10

percentile refers to, I just want to know what those

11

things are that are being distributed.

12

where I find the ambiguity.

13

ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the

14

agency at least as I understand it.

15

I asked the question.

16

MR. VAN AMBERG:

And - and that's

And if there is an

So -- so that's why

All right.

And, and I

17

think I understand the question now, Justice Breyer.

18

Thank you.

19

The units that are ranked or distributed are

20

the LEAs or the school districts.

21

in order of their per pupil expenditures and revenues.

22

Those are the units and the component parts of this

23

calculation that are provided for us by Congress.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

you have to do it that way?

And they are ranked

And does the statute say
It has to be the group

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

that's distributed?
MR. VAN AMBERG:

It's my understanding under

3

-- under Brown and Williamson is if Congress speaks to

4

an issue, Congress is to be obeyed.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Clearly.

6

MR. VAN AMBERG:

There is nothing mysterious

7

about this type of a methodology.

8

that Congress chose.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And this is the one

No, you could do it that

10

way and the reason the Government, I think, says that

11

you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an

12

absurd result.

13

MR. VAN AMBERG:

All right.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That the object of the

15

statute is to catch the outliers.

16

example, had one giant school district like New York

17

City which was at the top of the list and another giant

18

school district that was at the bottom of the list you

19

would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half

20

the pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be

21

outliers would they?

22

And if you, for

I mean, that's the problem.

MR. VAN AMBERG:

And you have a similar

23

infirmity associated with the other methodology.

24

is, if you have a number of LEAs which are small in

25

numbers, as in New Mexico, particularly if you had a
14
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

number of small LEAs at the bottom, which is I think a

2

huge problem policy wise, you were to cut them out and

3

let them to float off in their poverty.

4

understand where there is -

I think, I can

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't, doesn't

6

subsection b(ii) address outliers?

7

there wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and

8

maybe it's, it's because of some reason I'm unaware of.

9

That says that the Secretary in making this

I was surprised

10

determination can take into account particular types of

11

LEAs where there is extra, additional costs.

12

have thought for example if you had a very small LEA

13

with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high

14

because you don't have economies of scale, that you

15

haven't -- that would, could be knocked out for that

16

reason.

17

I would

Is that not how that works?
MR. VAN AMBERG:

Yes.

And this is the, the

18

whole problem, that we can argue philosophically how

19

whether Congress's methodology or the Secretary's

20

methodology is better, but the backdrop of this is that

21

the, the statute and also the regulation allows for

22

school, for the States to back out all these

23

disequalizing expenditures so that you, you make an

24

adjustment to more or less end up with a baseline per

25

pupil expenditure.

And there is really no reason after
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you do that for having a wide disparity, even between

2

the top and the bottom LEA.

3

The Secretary's formula, and I don't think

4

we should be arguing whose formula is better, because if

5

they are different, Congress wins, but nevertheless, the

6

Secretary's formula, it eliminates 26 percent of the

7

school districts.

8

look at the top and the bottom school district even

9

after the eliminating of these funding differentials,

10
11

And under New Mexico, if you, if you

you've got a 244 percent disparity.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It, it eliminates 26 school

12

districts but those 26 school districts account for 5

13

percent or 10 percent of the pupils.

14

we are interested in here is not school districts; they

15

are not a thing -- they are a thing of a kind, but we

16

are interested in students, real people who get money.

17

And so that it, that it -- it eliminates 26 percent of

18

the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not

19

a bad thing, because what we are really interested in

20

are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.

21

MR. VAN AMBERG:

And I guess what

And Justice Breyer, I think

22

Congress and in its methodology has disagreed with that

23

view, because it does not rely strictly upon pupils, and

24

pupils are not necessarily the driving force in how we

25

work this formula.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought the problem was

2

disparity in school districts.

3

funding for education is local funding, in some places

4

there are very rich school districts and very, very

5

poor, poor school districts.

6

purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an

7

enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Van Amberg, if there

24

is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant

25

consideration might be how would this work across
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

States, and I think it's true, is it not, that your

2

reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different

3

results from State to State depending on whether they

4

have large districts or small districts at the top and

5

the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils

6

rather than school districts regardless of size, you

7

would get uniformity going from State to State.

8
9

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Justice Ginsburg, the

Secretary recognized in 1976 that both methodologies

10

have their problems, depending on how your districts,

11

the number of districts that you have in a State, their

12

relative populations, how they line up.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -

Am I correct in

14

understanding that at the end of the line here, if you

15

win the Federal money will go to your two districts,

16

whereas if the other side wins the Federal money will go

17

to the State?

Is that what the bottom line is?

18

MR. VAN AMBERG:

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. VAN AMBERG:

That's the bottom line.
Yes.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Let me ask another general

8

question.

If it were true, and I don't think it is in

9

this case, that the biggest district was the one that

10

got the most per pupil money -- the two biggest

11

districts that were at the opposite ends of the

12

spectrum, they would all be taken out, wouldn't they,

13

under your view?

14

MR. VAN AMBERG:

Well, it actually

15

depends -- you get into statistical approaches, but if,

16

let's say, there were less than 20 districts, you just

17

had let's say 18 districts or 19 districts, then if you

18

do the percentile against, if you work the percentile in

19

that particular setting, nobody gets eliminated.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you have the same

21

problem if it's students, I take it?

22

same statistical question whether you, you use districts

23

or students?

But what about

Justice Stevens' question.

6

our State -- it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it -

students, and the poor district has another quarter.

our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating

And the practical effect is that in New Mexico the

formula which the Respondents contend is absurd reduced

only 11 percent of the LEAs.

4

this, that these LEAs should have been more or less

5

equalized anyhow because of removing the disparate

6

funding, that's, that's much more reasonable and

7

certainly doesn't reflect an absurdity, and when you

compare that to the Secretary's approach which

eliminates 26 percent and cuts loose 23 school districts

And with the backdrop that

out of 89 from any consideration and you end up with

forcefully that that's an absurdity.

the better reading, but we certainly think it's not

25

unambiguously foreclosed.

And we happen to think it's

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, Brand X says that,

6

but it's a characterization of the step one inquiry

8

Your Honor.

9

And we can use "foreclosed" if you like,

But the clearest indication that the statute

10

does not foreclose the Secretary's methodology is a

11

provision that I think hasn't been addressed thus far in

12

the argument and that's that in the very same act in

13

Congress in which Congress enacted Section 7709, the

14

provision at issue here, Congress also explicitly

endorsed and incorporated the Secretary's -

acknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument,

although I don't think it's persuasive.

does is to explicitly incorporate the Secretary's

that we want to use it and we want you to continue to

In the one case, in this act we're worried

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, at that level of

8

generality you might be right, but with respect to the

9

purpose of the equalization provisions of both of those

10

acts the purpose is exactly the same.

11

just like in EFIG, the question is to what extent has

12

the State equalized expenditures across school

districts.

14

In impact aid,

It's the very same question.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe let me

15

ask it directly.

If they could so easily just say we

16

incorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why

17

didn't they do it here?

18

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, because -

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They instead went to

20

the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not

21

mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation

22

methodology is.

23

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, they didn't mimic it.

24

They incorporated it.

And so far as the argument is

25

that they incorporated just the regulation qua

2

don't think that that argument can be squared with the

statutory text or the regulatory text.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I ask, is there

5

a difference legally between a regulation and an

6

appendix to the regulation?

7

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't think so, at least

8

not in the circumstance of this case, where the

9

regulation by its own terms incorporates the appendix.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, if you look at 2(a),

3

Your Honor what that says is that the disparity, the

4

disparity standard at its broadest level deals with

5

whether the per-pupil revenues for the highest ranked

6

local educational agency exceeds the per pupil revenues

7

for the lowest one by 25 percent.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It would make no difference

10

if you take into account pupils for that part of the

analysis, and here's the reason why.

12

account pupils with respect to a local educational

agency and you weight the local, the figure by the

14

number of pupils served by the local educational agency,

the per pupil figure that you're going to attach to each

So for purposes of this part of the statute,

whether you took into account the number of pupils or

not you'd still be dealing with the same two figures.

the same, but the fact remains you don't use that

you should take the same approach in A, especially if it

district you don't spend the same amount of money on the

They have a per-pupil number because

of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs

a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars.

have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you

creating this artificial association and then using,

using that methodology?

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It makes sense to speak

It doesn't make

He may

Well, it's an approximation

20

to be sure, and per-pupil revenues by definition deal

21

with approximations across the swath of students that

22

are covered by local educational agencies.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it's only -- the

24

reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a

25

swath of students, the district, that's the way it
32

2

maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the

actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your

4

methodology would make sense.

5

When you're ranking it by pupils,

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, I think what we're

6

really doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by

7

the amount of pupils in the school district, and the

8

reason we're doing that is to get a more accurate

9

picture of the extent to which any one school district's

10

per-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall

11

revenue pictures in the State.

example which I think might help to crystallize why it's

necessary to do this sort of weighting and why education

And so what that does is a piggyback on the
way that the State approaches the situation.

So this,

as -- this provision as the Secretary understands it

allows it to give effect to a State that gives effect to

those sorts of considerations, but it's not an

13

independent grant of authority for the Secretary himself

to take those considerations into account.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then -- then would you

address the text?

3

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure, I will.

4

It's at page 4a of the appendix of the

5

Government's brief, b -- (b)(i).

And what the text says

6

is disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil

7

expenditures or revenues above the 59th percentile or

8

below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or

9

revenues in the State.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

11

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Now one point I make -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So what is supposed to be

13

disregarded are educational agencies?

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

16

are identified how?

17

that would be disregarded?

18

And the agencies

How do we identify the agencies

MR. SRINIVASAN:

You identify the agencies

19

to be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th

20

percentiles of per-pupil revenues in the State.

21

then you disregard -

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And

And we identify their

23

per-pupil revenues, too, don't we?

24

per-pupil expenditures or revenues above or below,

25

right?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes, but -- and -- but the

2

critical test is the 95th percentile and 5th percentile

3

of such expenditures or revenues in the State.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But that critical test is

5

being applied to an agency which is being identified by

6

reference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues,

7

correct?

8
9

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It is.

I mean there is no

doubt that the per-pupil revenues or expenditure figures

10

that lie on the spectrum are associated with the local

11

educational agencies.

12

That's how -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's not merely that

13

they are associated with.

The very definition, the very

14

identification of LEA here is exclusively in terms of

15

per-pupil expenditures or revenues.

16

association.

It's not merely in

It is a definition, isn't that so?

17

MR. SRINIVASAN:

I don't think so.

The -

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then, then what does the

19

phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95

20

or below 5 mean?

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, that's true that each

22

local education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or

23

revenue.

24

59th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures

25

or revenues doesn't foreclose weighting.

But the critical part of the statute which has

38
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the point that Justice Alito made bears, which is -

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, why doesn't it?

It

3

seems to me that the only identification of an entity or

4

person, if you want, to be disregarded is the

5

identification of an LEA, and the LEA is described in

6

terms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues.

7

why doesn't that foreclose your position?

8

MR. SRINIVASAN:

9

the answer, Justice Souter.

So

Well, we -- two parts to
First the Secretary's

10

formulation, no less than Petitioner's formulation, does

11

disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil

12

revenues above the 95th and 5th percentiles.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Where we disagree is in

15

Obviously -

identifying the 95th exactly.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

terms of the expenditures or revenues.

18

you're supposed to do.

19

MR. SRINIVASAN:

After identifying them in

Exactly.

That's what

And I'd -

20

exactly.

21

made earlier, which is that Congress could have

22

compelled the approach that Petitioners compelled -

23

contend, if it would have said -

24
25

And I'd reiterate the point that Justice Alito

JUSTICE SOUTER:

There are lots of things

that Congress could have done differently from what it
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an

2

ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection

3

of the LEA that we are talking about.

4

create an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what

5

is to be disregarded is an LEA as so defined.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

And it doesn't

Well, I think it does, Your

7

Honor, because there are two different ways of ranking

8

the LEAs.

9

associated with each LEA and simply take that list into

One is to take the per-pupil revenues

10

account.

11

weight it by the number of pupils in each LEA.

12
13
14
15
16
17
18

Another is to take the same list but then

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, that's another way to

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Nothing in the statute

--

forecloses that approach.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- do it, but tell me why

that is consistent with the text.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

Because the text refers to

19

the 95th and 5th percentiles of such expenditures or

20

revenues in the State, and the list that includes the

21

weighting does represent a list of expenditures or

22

revenues in the State.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would such be -- of such

24

expenditures or revenues.

That refers back to local

25

educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or

2

of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil

3

expenditures or revenues.

4

It's referring you back not to the totality

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Sure.

And I don't, I don't

5

dispute that the per-pupil revenue figures belong to a

6

local educational agency.

7

that you can't take into account the relative extent to

8

which a particular school district contributes to the

9

overall State picture, and the way you do that -

10

But again that doesn't mean

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Wouldn't the statute

11

have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according

12

to the ranking?

13

which suggests the ranking -- at least to me, that the

14

ranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils.

15

It does tell you to disregard LEAs,

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, it is, it is a

16

ranking of LEAs in the first instance and then it's,

17

each of those LEA figures is weighted by the number of

18

pupils the way we do it, and we do end up disregarding

19

LEAs.

20

is identifying the 5th and 95th percentiles, and on that

21

step we take into account the number of pupils.

22

only at that step that we take into account the number

23

of pupils.

But as Justice Souter pointed out the first step

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I would have thought

proposal to drop, it was the Secretary's proposal to

13

drop the bottom five.

and what was the reason for that?

95th percentile but not the 5th?

16

So it was a different proposal,

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Why keep, keep the

Well, as we point out in a

footnote in our brief there was some education finance

18

experts that suggested there would be no reason to

retain the exclusion at the bottom of the range, and I

20

think that's because when you have low per-pupil

revenues there is a reason not to exclude those figures.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Don't you think

14

Congress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this

15

provision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and

16

your reading prevents the money that Congress meant to

17

go to those particular districts from actually reaching

18

the districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read

19

it the way that, let the money get where Congress meant

20

it to go?

21

MR. MANASEVIT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, because that was on the list of things that I

23

wanted to cover, and I'm sure that petitioners 'counsel

24

inadvertently misspoke.

25

diverted from the district.

Impact aid never ever gets

Federal Government pursuant to a formula CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, sure, but then

3

the question is whether the State can consider it when

4

they're figuring out how much money to give it.

5

effect it's diverted.

6

MR. MANASEVIT:

So in

Well, remember, the State

7

figures a total cost of program for every district

8

starting from zero, number of students and dollars

9

needed to manage those number of students, and the State

10

supplies that amount of money.

So where the district

11

gets some of that necessary money from another source,

12

the State under equalization is allowed to just consider

13

that that amount of money, in addition to what the State

14

is going to provide, will provide the entire amount.

15

Mr. Van Amberg, you

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. VAN AMBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. VAN AMBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice had a

22

question as to whether or not the, an appendix is

23

something different from a regulation or carries a

24

different weight, and I haven't found anything

25

determinative.

But I would refer the Court to Young
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

versus Community Nutrition Institute where it identifies

2

something similar to an appendix as an example, and the

3

Court says an example is just that, an example.

4

And I don't think we need the argument to

5

prevail, but we would submit that it is at best

6

confusion, it's confusing that the Secretary would take

7

the body of the methodology proposed by Congress, put it

8

in his, in the body of his regulation, and then refer

9

the public to an appendix in order to, how to work the

10

methodology.

11

Congress intended and what he had in the body of his own

12

regulation.

13

And in this appendix, he then flips what

I would also suggest that Congress cannot be

14

presumed even in this instance to not be, at least have

15

some input as to what was happening.

16

bill, my understanding is that there was a suggestion

17

that the disparity figure would only be 10 percent and

18

not 25 percent.

19

statute as it was written, and I think lasted for about

20

a year or so, had the disparity amount going from 25

21

percent to 20 percent.

22

and kept back up at the 25 percent level.

23

that this was not a bill where Congress paid attention,

24

I think, is not a warranted assumption.

25

In the Senate

That didn't make it through but the

That was subsequently amended

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the idea

Mr. Van Amberg, could a

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

State get to the same result?

2

the statute is the only permissible one.

3

school districts, it's no longer going to be the X

4

school district and the Y school district, it will be

5

the XY school district, and then the population would

6

increase.

7

Let's say your reading of
By combining

Still only one LEA.
MR. VAN AMBERG:

There is a provision,

8

Justice Ginsburg, in the Impact Aid Act, and I think

9

it's 7113, in which it basically says that if the

10

Secretary of the Education perceives that a State is

11

manipulating its LEAs in a way in which to take

12

advantage of the, of this limited exception, it can

13

disregard that action.

14

think Congress was one step ahead of us and recognized

15

that possibility and addressed it.

So I think there is built -- I
