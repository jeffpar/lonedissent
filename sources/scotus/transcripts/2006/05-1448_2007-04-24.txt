ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MILLER BAKER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BAKER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

After filing for bankruptcy, Crown Vantage

12

decided to terminate 12 over-funded pension plans.

13

terminating these pension plans, Crown was able to

14

provide its plan participants with 100 percent of their

15

accrued benefits and at the same time recover almost $5

16

million in surplus plan assets for the benefits of both

17

Crown's creditors as well as plan members who made

18

individual contributions to those pension plans.

19

By

After Crown made the decision to terminate

20

these pension plans, it received a merger proposal from

21

the PACE union to merge the pension plan into the PACE

22

multi-employer pension plan.

23

proposal.

24

its fiduciary duty by not sufficiently considering that

25

merger proposal.

Crown rejected that

The Ninth Circuit held that Crown breached

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

This Court should reverse the Ninth Circuit

2

for two separate and independent reasons.

First, merger

3

is a nonfiduciary plan sponsor function and Crown could

4

not have had a fiduciary duty to consider the merger

5

proposal by PACE.

6

beginning with Curtiss-Wright and continuing with

7

Lockheed, Hughes aircraft and Pegram hold that decisions

8

to create, to modify, to terminate, or to amend pension

9

plans are sponsor functions, settlor functions under

A series of this Court's decisions

10

trust law, that are not subject to ERISA fiduciary

11

duties.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I could understand that

13

if the plan is being set up or if there's going to be a

14

change to the multiemployer plan while the business is

15

ongoing.

16

employer elects to have an annuity, then choosing which

17

insurance company is going to supply the annuity, that

18

would be a fiduciary function.

19

termination, the merger that's proposed here, is instead

20

of having an annuity we'll put the assets into this

21

other plan.

22

for an ongoing operation and saying, we're out of it and

23

we're now going to try to distribute the assets in the

24

way that will best protect the beneficiaries.

25

But in this situation, you, you say if the

Well, this is, the

It's quite different from choosing a form

MR. BAKER:

Justice -- Justice Ginsburg,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that's not correct.

The answer to that question is that

2

a decision to terminate a plan or a decision to merge a

3

plan requires that a plan sponsor consider as a

4

threshold matter several factors.

5

plan form be of the acquiring plan?

6

would have required the merger into a multiemployer plan

7

as opposed to a single employer plan.

8

form of the plan.

9

in a new plan sponsor and a new plan administrator.

First, what will the
And PACE's proposal

That goes to the

PACE's proposal would have resulted
It

10

would have resulted in a new dispute resolution

11

mechanism.

12

finally, most importantly, the PACE proposal would have

13

gone to the level of benefits provided by the plan and

14

the level of benefits, as this Court has repeatedly

15

recognized is a decision that is a plan sponsor

16

decision.

17

That goes to the content of the plan.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

Well if you're correct and

18

this was a sponsor decision, not a fiduciary decision,

19

let me ask you when you're wearing, when the company is

20

wearing its sponsor hat and says we're going to

21

terminate this plan, does it have a duty to consider the

22

best interests and the security of the employees, number

23

one, when it picks an insurance company?

24

some flaky insurance company if there is a much more

25

solid insurance company, can it?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

It can't pick

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. BAKER:

Justice Kennedy, it depends upon

2

the function at issue.

If the function is the selection

3

of an insurance company to provide the annuity, that is

4

a plan administrator function and it is subject to ERISA

5

fiduciary duties.

6

But you is to analyze it from -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if have this duty to

7

consider the interest of the employees in selecting the,

8

the insurance company, in selecting the amount of the

9

annuity, etcetera, if you have that duty it seems to me

10

that that's a fiduciary duty.

11

MR. BAKER:

It absolutely is, Justice

12

Kennedy, Kennedy.

13

selection of the annuity that the plan sponsor, the plan

14

administrator, must purchase after the plan sponsor has

15

made that threshold decision to terminate the plan.

16

There is that threshold decision.

17

18

But it is only in the context of the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And likewise, merger

No, but that's I think our

19

sticking point.

If the, if the plan sponsor decides to

20

purchase an annuity, it's accepted I think by you and by

21

everybody that there are two decisions being made.

22

Decision one is terminate the plan.

24

gives the beneficiaries what they should get.

Decision two,

And so

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But when we come to the question of merger,

2

you're saying there's only one decision, and I think

3

that's where I'm having trouble with your argument.

4

When we come to the question of merger, it seems to me

5

there are two decisions again.

6

we're going to terminate the plan that we've got.

7

do we do with our assets.

8

one possible decision as an alternative to annuities is

9

to merge the plan with, with another one.

The first decision is
What

We have decided to merge -

Why aren't

10

there two decisions in the merger case just as there are

11

two decisions in the annuity case?

12

MR. BAKER:

There are two decisions in a

13

merger case and the threshold question, Justice Souter,

14

is whether to merge.

15

Whether to merge is a -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why do you say that's the

16

threshold question?

17

whether to terminate what we've got now.

18

I thought the threshold question is

That's a different question,

It's at that point that PACE arrived and said:

10

MR. BAKER:

Justice Souter, there are two

11

different questions.

12

question is merger, and they're not the same.

13

question whether to merge is a sponsor decision because

14

you have to make those threshold questions as to what

15

will the form of the plan be, what will the benefits

16

provided be.

assets, Justice Souter.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Are you saying you can't
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

have a merger of a plan that has already been

2

terminated, so that the merger decision is necessarily a

3

decision that has to be made before the termination -

4

before a termination decision.

5

MR. BAKER:

It is -- once a plan decision,

6

once a termination decision has been made, and once that

7

decision has been executed, it's impossible to merge the

8

plan.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Baker, I thought your

10

position in your briefs, and I don't know why you do not

11

make this reply to this exchange, is that the merger

12

with another plan is not a termination, isn't that your

13

basic position?

14
15
16
17
18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's what I keep

suggesting.
MR. BAKER:

Absolutely, it's not a

termination.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because if it were a

19

termination, in a termination, you must distribute the

20

assets to the participants.

21

with somebody else, the assets are not distributed to

22

the participants, but they are thrown into a pot with

23

other people.

24
25

MR. BAKER:

And here when you merge

That's absolutely correct,

Justice Scalia.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I agree with Justice

2

Scalia, that that's one answer.

3

have -- there are two arguments here.

4

exploring now is whether this is a fiduciary obligation

5

or a sponsor obligation.

6

MR. BAKER:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On the other hand, you
And what we are

That's correct.
So we will have to assume

8

for that -- if you can't do it by merger, then the whole

9

case goes away anyway.

If merger is not permitted under

10

the statute, then we don't need to worry whether it's a

11

fiduciary response, correct?

12

MR. BAKER:

That's correct.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So what we're asking in

14

the first part of this argument is whether or not it's a

15

fiduciary response.

16

I are questioning.

17

there is a meeting of the board of directors, we think

18

we are going to terminate this plan.

19

choices are made as to how to terminate it.

20

difficult for me to see why the interests of the

21

employees are not uppermost in -- in your duties, i.e. a

22

fiduciary duty, when you decide how you're going to

23

terminate it.

24
25

And that's what Justice Souter and
And it does seem to me, assume that

MR. BAKER:

At that point,
And it's

The answer, Justice Kennedy, is

that it is a business decision to decide in what form

the benefits are going to be provided.

2

choice between a termination and a merger goes to that

3

issue.

4

vesting -

5

And the very

For example, in a merger, there is no automatic

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why can't you say it's a

6

business decision as to which insurance company you're

7

going to select.

8
9
10

Maybe you do say that.

MR. BAKER:

Because at that point, it's a

mere execution of the prior policy decision.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that's the way

11

you characterize it.

12

execution, when it's an annuity and it's not mere

13

execution when it's a merger, once the determination

14

decision has been made.

15

I don't know why it's mere

MR. BAKER:

Because the merger decision -

16

you have to ask those threshold questions, Justice

17

Kennedy, what are the level of benefits that are going

18

to be provided in the acquiring plan.

19

there is no automatic vesting of accrued benefits as

20

there is in a termination.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

In a merger,

I'm just listening to this.

22

It sounds to me as if you're saying, one, the employer

23

decides to terminate, okay?

24

go to the next question.

25

in respect to that, I think Justice Kennedy was asking,

Now that's done.

Then we

How would we terminate?

12
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

as I heard him, don't you have a fiduciary duty when you

2

decide how.

3

you do.

4

And your answer, as I heard it, was yes,

And now there is a third question.

Does

5

what happened in terminating mean that although you have

6

a fiduciary duty, you couldn't consider a merger,

7

because that's just not consistent with the basic plan

8

of terminating.

9

even bother to answer it.

10
11

Is that right?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it's wrong, don't

He doesn't like to hear

that he is wrong.

MR. BAKER:

None of us do, Justice Scalia.

13

The answer to the third part of that question, Justice

14

Breyer, is yes.

15

second predicate, which is that the -- the execution of

16

the termination is necessarily -

17

But where I disagree with you is in the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why did you answer yes to

18

his question, Justice Kennedy's, about the insurance

19

company?

20

MR. BAKER:

Perhaps I was imprecise.

If I

21

was imprecise, I apologize.

The answer is, it depends

22

upon the function at issue.

A broad generalization that

23

any decision taken after termination is necessarily a

24

plan sponsor function is just wrong.

25

the function at issue, and the function in connection
13
Alderson Reporting Company

One has to look at

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

with a merger is a plan sponsor decision, because you

2

can't get away from those threshold questions as to the

3

form, the content, and the benefits that are to be

4

provided in that plan.

5
6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why isn't exactly the same

point true with respect to purchasing annuities?

7

MR. BAKER:

Because the decision has already

8

been made, usually it's in the plan document, to provide

9

for annuities.

And the only question is providing the

10

annuity that is best suited to the interest of the

11

principals.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What if the plan document

13

doesn't say anything about what will follow termination.

14

There is nothing in there about annuities.

15

annuity -- the decision to purchase annuities a decision

16

subject to fiduciary obligation.

17

MR. BAKER:

Is the

18

20

of the annuities -- and I note that the Internal Revenue

21

Service will require -

22

Yes, Justice Souter.

recapture a reversion is perfectly permissible, so long

as the plan sponsor complies with all the relevant

19

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

20
21

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

22

An employer does not have a fiduciary duty

23

to consider merger as a means of terminating a defined

24

benefit pension plan.

25

decision to terminate the plan, the decision to merge

First of all, just like the

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the plan is a sponsor function, because it's a choice to

2

alter the design, composition and structure of the plan.

3

And because both the decision to terminate and the

4

decision to merge are sponsor functions, the choice

5

between the two is a sponsor function.

6

The plan administrator has a duty to carry

7

out the sponsor's decision to terminate the plan, not to

8

revisit that decision by considering whether to merge

9

the plan instead.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose the argument is

11

made very forcefully that the insurance companies with

12

these annuities haven't been doing so well, but there is

13

this multi-employer plan that has been just performing

14

so well, and so the -- an appeal is made to the company,

15

you're going out of business, you're not going to be

16

running a plan anymore.

17

those assets to the place where they will serve the

18

employees best.

19

MR. ROBERTS:

Put those assets, distribute

Well, that would be not be a

20

distribution of the assets as a means of terminating the

21

plan, but the employer as a sponsor could, of course,

decide to merge the plan instead of to terminate the

23

plan, if the employer made that choice.

You're making the same

rigid argument that Mr. Baker made, that whatever the
19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

termination, even though the company is going out of

2

business, it's bankrupt, it's always -- a merger is

3

always characterized as a sponsor business, not

4

fiduciary.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

There are two reasons

6

that I say that.

7

of a plan that's going out of business, and that isn't

8

going to be participating in any merged plan, the merger

9

still is a decision to alter the design and composition

10

and structure of the plan, as this case illustrates for

11

the reasons that Mr. Baker said.

12

change fundamentally the plan from a single employer

13

plan to a multi-employer plan, that it's going to change

14

the -- who is the administrator, that it's going to

15

increase the pool of participants, that it's going to

16

affect the benefits, because the assets that were

17

available to pay the benefits are now going to be

18

available to pay benefits of other participants in the,

19

in the successor plan, that the PBGC's guarantee of the

20

benefits is going to be lower in a multi-employer plan.

21

First, even in the case of a sponsor

That it's going to

So for all those reasons, it's going to

22

change, still change the structure of the plan.

23

addition to that, the employer of -- the sponsor of this

24

plan that would either terminate, or possibly merge, has

25

a legitimate interest in choosing termination rather
20
Alderson Reporting Company

But in

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

than merger, because in a termination, the sponsor can

2

obtain a reversion of the surplus assets, and still

3

fully provide all the benefits of the employees.

4
5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could an administrator

make that decision in its fiduciary capacity?
MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor, and that goes

7

back to a confusion that I think was -- was present

8

before, that the decision about the distribution options

9

at termination is a sponsor decision that the employer

10

makes in the plan documents, because those distribution

11

options are benefits under the plan.

12

And while Section 1341(b)(3)(A), in

13

isolation, might appear to permit the plan administrator

14

to choose which of those distribution options that are

15

in the plan to make available, other provisions of ERISA

16

and the tax code prohibit the plan from vesting that

17

discretion in the plan administrator.

18

So in other words, the way it works is when

19

the employer sets up the plan, the employer provides for

20

the forms of distribution that are going to be available

21

at termination.

22

benefits, optional ways of providing the accrued

23

benefits to the participants.

24

get to pick among those options at termination.

25

And those forms are just forms of

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And then the participants

Then why are we having this

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument?

2

the provision for options in the original plan.

3

Why isn't it simply a question of construing

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, we think that one

4

requirement is that it's consistent with the plan, and

5

the plan didn't provide that here.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. ROBERTS:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9
10
11

Then why isn't -

Held it was waived.
Then why isn't the simple

argument, you can't merge because the plan didn't
provide that as an option.
MR. ROBERTS:

That would certainly be a

12

basis on which the Court of Appeals could have correctly

13

decided this case, other than the way it did.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Was that position

15

presented, I should have asked you -

16

MR. ROBERTS:

It was presented.

The Court

17

of Appeals held that Petitioner had waived the argument,

18

based on the terms of the plan, because Petitioner

19

hadn't made that argument in the bankruptcy court, even

20

though the district court had actually addressed the

21

terms of the plan, but mistakenly construed the plan to

22

permit merger, Your Honor.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So we've got to assume that

24

the plan is silent in the sense that, insofar as the

25

plan documents are concerned, merger is at least a
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

possibility.

2

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think that you have to

3

assume that, Your Honor.

I think that because the Court

4

of Appeals vacated the district court's decision, you

5

know, there is no decision on it.

6

to -- to resolving the questions presented, I think the

7

Court could address that question.

8

necessary to resolve the questions presented because we

9

think that merger is a, is a sponsor decision as a

And if it's necessary

We don't think it's

10

choice to alter the design, composition and the

11

structure of the plan even if it arises in the context

12

of termination.

13

And in addition, we also think that

14

merger is not a permissible method of plan termination

15

under the statute or PBGC regulations which treat merger

16

and termination as distinct procedures.

17

requires that the assets of a terminating plan be

18

distributed by allocating them among the participants of

19

that plan.

20

Instead the assets are transferred to the successor plan

21

and in the successor plan they are commingled to fund

22

the benefits of all the participants in that plan.

23

The statute

That just doesn't occur in a merger.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could a plan document

24

provide that upon termination the employer is entitled

25

to a refund of any excess funding?
23
Alderson Reporting Company

And would that then

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be binding on an administrator in a fiduciary capacity?

2

MR. ROBERTS:

The plan document could

3

provide for a reversion for the employer and in fact

4

this -- it does.

5
6

But the -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I take it the

administrator would then have the duty to obey that?

7

MR. ROBERTS:

That.

Yes, because that would

8

be consistent with ERISA and the administrator has to

9

follow the plan in accordance with ERISA.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why doesn't the

11

administrator here take the position that it's going to

12

reserve the five million for itself and merge what's

13

left?

14

PACE doesn't, end of problem?

15

If PACE wants a merger with what's left, fine; if

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, an employer, not an

16

administrator could, could as a sponsor of the plan

17

decide to do a transfer of assets and liabilities of

18

some portion of the, of the plan assets and retain some

19

assets in the plan.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

My question is why -- why

21

isn't it an option here to say all right, number one, we

22

got a $5 million surplus.

23

this plan and we are going to take the five million.

24

Question number two, should we, should we use what's

25

left to merge into the PACE plan?

We are going to terminate

Is that an option?

24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROBERTS:

What the employer would have

2

to do would be make a sponsor decision to make a

3

transfer of assets and liabilities to the PACE plan

4

before terminating the plan.

5

that decision but that, that decision and the decision

6

afterwards to terminate the remains of the plan would

7

both be sponsor decisions that the employer wouldn't

8

make in a fiduciary capacity.

9
10
11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The employer could make

By doing it in that

sequence could it reserve the five million for itself?
MR. ROBERTS:

It -- it could conceivably do

12

that, Your Honor, subject to the fact that there are

13

guidelines that the agencies have put out, the 1984

14

joint guidelines that require in some cases, in order to

15

prevent circumvention of the termination requirements,

16

that require the purchase of annuities or the other

17

distribution of the assets, that those guidelines

18

require that if there is a spinoff or a transfer of

19

assets that's followed by the, by the termination of the

20

remains of the transferee plan, that in some

21

circumstances annuities have to be purchased for the

22

accrued benefits of the participants that are

23

transferred into the other ongoing plan and that are

24

going to be participants of that plan.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If we assume that, can they

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

keep the five million?

2
3

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor but that would

be a decision that they make as sponsor of the plan.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't care how they make

5

it; I just want to know under the terms of the plan and

6

consistently with ERISA, could they keep the five

7

million and in some sequence provide for a merger with

8

PACE?

And I think you're telling me yes.

9

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, Your Honor, subject to

10

the fact that here it's quite possible that the PBGC

11

would consider a transfer of assets and liabilities just

12

to leave assets in a plan as a reversion, that they

13

would be subject to that requirement.

14

have to annuitize the benefits of, of the participants

15

in the plan.

16

that and they would say that looks like an effort just

17

to extract assets out of what's really an ongoing plan

18

because the employer is not going to be participating in

19

that other plan.

20

And so they would

Because the PBGC would -- would look at

The -- they are just stripping it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then why couldn't the PBGC

21

say, you know, we are not quite sure how these insurance

22

companies work.

23

five million is an extra guarantee to make sure the

24

annuities are paid and that also goes to the insurance

25

company?

So we'll buy the annuity and then the

MR. ROBERTS:

If I could answer the

2

question.

The -- the -- they could not -- the plan

3

administrator could decide to give the reversion to the

4

employees and not -- not take a reversion.

5

amend the plan to allow that but the point is it has a

6

legitimate interest in taking the reversion and that

7

that interest encourages plan sponsors to fully fund

8

their plan, and depriving it of that would prevent them

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JULIA P. CLARK,

13

It could

Thank you, Counsel.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

14

MS. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

15

please the Court.

It's notable that neither the

16

Petitioner nor the Government in their arguments here

17

has referred at all to the definition of fiduciary in

18

ERISA.

19

this Court's decisions as to what is a fiduciary

20

function and what is not.

21

from 29 U.S.C., Section 1002(21)(A), it's in the first

22

page of the appendix to our brief, is that a person is a

23

fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent that -

24

and then it goes on and there are three subparts, two of

25

which are relevant in this case.

But that is the beginning point of every one of

The statute and I'm quoting

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

One of them and I'm taking them out of order

2

because I think subpart 3 is the simplest way to resolve

3

this case, "to the extent that he has any discretionary

4

authority or discretionary responsibility in the

5

administration of the plan."

6

relevant is subpart 1, which is "to the extent he

7

has" -- "he exercises any authority or control

8

respecting disposition of its assets."

9

The other one that's

The reason that the plan administration

10

subpart is the simplest way to resolve this case is that

11

Congress in Section 1341 of 29 U.S. Code, and that's

12

quoted just immediately below what I was just citing to

13

the Court, specifically assigned to the plan

14

administrator all of the decisions that must be made

15

with respect to implementing the termination of a

16

pension plan.

17

must be done is stated specifically to be done by the

18

plan administrator.

19

Throughout that section, everything that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course this argument

20

would not have any force whatever if indeed,

21

transferring the assets to another plan does not

22

constitute a termination of the plan.

23

MS. CLARK:

Justice Scalia, that of course

24

is the second major issue in the case, and the

25

Government's attorney admitted that in a two-stage
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

transaction, the assets and liabilities of a plan can be

2

transferred to another plan, and the plan can be

3

terminated and assuming the plan provisions are

4

correctly in place the employer can take the reversion

5

of any excess assets.

6

And then -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the first step would be

7

the transfer.

8

be a termination and therefore it would not be within

9

the authority of the administrator under this provision.

10

And at that, at that stage it would not

MS. CLARK:

Justice Scalia, the

11

implementation guidelines which the Government attorney

12

also referred to have as their entire focus to make

13

certain that two-part transactions of just the sort that

14

you have referred to are treated as a single whole in

15

determining whether a plan has been legitimately

16

terminated or not.

17

is, we are not going to permit an employer by separating

18

things out into two parts, first the transfer of assets

19

and liabilities, then a termination, to do in form what

20

in substance is simply the continuation of the same

21

plan.

22

The entire focus of those guidelines

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's fine, but that still

23

does not convert the termination decision into, into a,

24

an administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's

25

decision.
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. CLARK:

I agree completely -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sure, you can oversee it

3

and make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in

4

the two-step process but the -- but the determination

5

whether to terminate or not is a sponsor's

6

determination.

7

MS. CLARK:

I agree completely, Justice

8

Scalia.

There is no question here but that the decision

9

to terminate a plan is the plan's sponsor decision.

But

10

when the plan sponsor has made that decision and the

11

question on the table is how shall we implement that

12

decision to terminate, it does not matter whether that's

13

done through a two-step transaction in which assets are

14

first transferred to another plan and then the formal

15

termination of what's left remains.

16

guidelines make very clear that you can't tease those

17

apart and say no, we are only going to look at the final

18

step and that's a termination and nothing else is.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The implementation

But they, but they don't

20

say that in, in looking at the two of them, you suddenly

21

transform the decision whether to, to transfer as -- as

22

sponsor to the administrator.

24
25

You transfer that decision from the plan

MS. CLARK:

No, Justice Scalia.

The

implementation guidelines did not address the question
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of in what capacity these decisions would be made.

2

point in referring to it is simply to say that it is, it

3

is a form over substance argument to say that there is a

4

difference between decision to terminate in which the

5

plan administrator then has a choice of implementing it

6

by either transferring the assets and liabilities to

7

another plan or purchasing an annuity, versus as the

8

Government and as the, I mean as the Petitioner would

9

have it, that that's a completely different transaction

10

from merger as a means of implementing -

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

I'm puzzled.

My

Can I just

get myself straightened out a little bit?

13

If there is a decision to terminate you're

14

suggesting, you're suggesting that it's after that

15

decision made, is made, there can be a decision to merge

16

which would not be a termination?

17

MS. CLARK:

18

That is correct, Justice

Stevens.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MS. CLARK:

21

-- that the termination decision

has been made.

22
23

Your, your adversary -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I disagree with you on

that.

24

MS. CLARK:

I'm sorry; I didn't -

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Your adversary takes a

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

position that the merger would be not a termination.
MS. CLARK:

That is what my adversary says.

3

And if I might focus on the termination section itself,

4

29 U.S.C. Section 1341, their position has been that a

5

merger with another plan is completely different from

6

the purchase of annuities to provide those benefits.

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It would seem to me that a

8

merger is a continuation rather than a termination.

9

explain to me why I'm wrong on that.

10

MS. CLARK:

And

The Government's regulations on

11

single employer plan mergers take the very clear

12

position, and we cited them in our brief, it's the

13

regulations under Section 414(1), the clear position

14

that any time there is a transfer of assets and

15

liabilities from one plan to another, whether a complete

16

transfer or not, that is treated as a spinoff of a plan

17

from the original plan and a merger of the spun off

18

assets and liabilities into the other plan.

19

So that merger is a more flexible concept.

20

It is not just the all-in kind of merger where two plans

21

merge and continue down the road as a single entity.

22

Merger also in the Government's own usage describes a

23

transaction in which all or some portion of liabilities

24

and all or some portion of assets are separated from the

25

original plan and transferred to the second plan.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, that being the case, the question

2

really as to whether this is the proposed, the proposal

3

of any merger -- and the question presented to the Court

4

is in the abstract, is any plan merger an acceptable

5

means of terminating a plan under Section 1341?

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

And -- and the

7

argument your adversaries make is that termination

8

requires that the plan assets be distributed to the

9

beneficiaries.

10
11
12

MS. CLARK:

Yes, Justice Scalia.

That's

what it says.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that in the case of a

13

merger the assets are not distributed to the

14

beneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan,

15

which benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan

16

but the beneficiaries of other plans.

17

MS. CLARK:

Justice Scalia, we disagree for

18

the following reason.

Section 1341 specifically

19

provides that the plan administrator implementing a plan

20

termination may -- and here I'm referring to the

21

language that's again in the appendix to our brief; this

22

is the last page of that appendix, right at the top -

23

plan administrator may purchase irrevocable commitments

24

from an insurer, that's an insured annuity, to provide

25

all benefit liabilities under the plan, or, in
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

accordance with provisions of the plan and any

2

applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all

3

benefit liabilities under the plan.

4

Now, this Court just last week in James vs.

5

United States construed a similar statute that had a

6

list of crimes followed by the phrase or otherwise

7

involves a serious risk of potential harm to persons -

8

I'm paraphrasing.

9

the majority and the dissenting opinion in that case

I didn't get it exactly right.

Both

10

agreed that an "otherwise" structure of this sort means

11

that what precedes the "otherwise" phrase is taken as a

12

baseline against which to judge what follows it, and

13

that it tells you what Congress had in mind as something

14

that satisfies in this case the distribution

15

requirements of the statute.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

But now, does

17

indeed the transfer here meet the requirement of little

18

(i)?

19

commitment to provide to these beneficiaries all that

20

they're entitled to, even at the expense of some of the

21

other beneficiaries of that plan?

But I thought we

10

just heard that the PBGC might look at it a little

differently, that they are more comfortable with the

13

benefits as opposed to just throwing the beneficiaries

14

into a pool with your other union members.

15

MS. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, it's very

16

clear that if as we are correct -- I mean, as we argue

17

here, if we're correct that it is a fiduciary

18

responsibility for the plan administrator to select the

19

option on the table that is most secure for providing

20

the benefits in the future to the participants, that if

21

the multiemployer plan in question were poorly funded or

22

shaky for any other reason and there is a solid

23

insurance company offering an annuity, that the plan

administrator would -

Well, why would the

beneficiaries be better off if there were a merger?

What would their benefit be, as opposed to an annuity?

MS. CLARK:

Probably the single advantage to

20

participants in a multiemployer plan is portability,

21

which is to say some of these participants were working

22

for employers that purchased facilities from Crown and

23

if their employer participated in the multiemployer plan

24

in the future they would be able to add to the benefits

25

that they had accrued and perhaps to reach something

of that?

2

MS. CLARK:

They do not.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

They do not, okay.

So I'm

4

trying to understand this, then, the reg under this, and

5

it says:

6

an insurance company, for example, or do the same thing,

7

get an irrevocable commitment in another permitted form.

8

So one question is when they do that the administrator

9

doesn't have to have any fiduciary thought in his mind.

Administrator, you buy the, the annuity from

10

The second position is -- that's their

11

position.

The second position is, even if that's so,

12

this is not another permitted form because a merger

13

isn't a determination.

14

that's what we were just getting to, is that we don't

15

see any way in which this could help the employee.

16

you say, oh yes, there is a way.

17

And the third position is,

Now

Now suppose we're choosing between two

18

insurance companies.

Insurance company A says:

We will

19

pay precisely what is owed, precisely; we're as solid as

20

a rock.

21

it says:

22

and we'll write each of them a check for $500.

23

that something that means then -- remember, this statute

24

says you have to get what they promised them and not a

25

penny more.

Insurance company B is hungry for business, so
We'll give those employees exactly what's owed
Now, is

Is that something that the insurance, the
38

administrator then has to do?

He has to take B because

2

the insurance company is promising him a bonus?

MS. CLARK:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well then, if not that why

MS. CLARK:

The Department of Labor has

No.

made clear that when making a fiduciary choice among

8

annuities that are offered by an insurer, it is the plan

administrator's fiduciary duty to look to the security

of the benefit.

That is its sole guiding concern.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And beyond as well?

12

I mean, let's say we have 5 million extra dollars here.

13

See, that's what I don't understand.

14

it's a fiduciary, I mean, how can they make a decision

15

ever to do anything other than just give the five

MS. CLARK:

24

this purpose.

The other side said that

the district court found that the argument was waived,

2

3

MS. CLARK:

Justice Scalia, it was the court

MS. CLARK:

Mr. Chief Justice, I could

answer that on two levels.

this case does not preclude the possibility that this

would have been negotiated to leave the reversion for

the employer.

6

7

it could have taken it.

8
9

One is that the record of

But that's speculation because, since the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are there a lot of

plans that look like that, that if there's extra money,

10

we've overfunded that it goes back to the union, not

11

back to the company?

12

MS. CLARK:

It never goes to the union.

13

That would be violation of a different section of

14

Federal law.

MS. CLARK:

But to a plan.

The reason -

17

and plans simply don't address this, except for

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, how could the

20

administrator, how could the administrator negotiate

21

with the employer to give the $5 million back if it's

22

with a fiduciary?

23

MS. CLARK:

If the employer had said, had

amended the plan to say, whatever you do by way of

25

terminating this plan, you must protect our right to the

two hats.

10

But what happens, what happens

The employer is also the administrator.

MS. CLARK:

Is

Is

No, Justice Kennedy, it is not,

11

because there there really is an impact on the form and

12

the amount of benefits that will be accrued in the

13

future under an ongoing plan, as well as -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then it's the ongoing

15

significance of the decision to the employer that

16

determines whether there's a fiduciary obligation?

17

MS. CLARK:

No, Justice Kennedy.

It's the

18

ongoing significance to the participants, because then

19

what you have is truly a plan design decision, which

20

does not come within plan administration, while in the

21

case of a merger as a means of implementing termination

22

the law fixes those benefits.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They are what they are.
I can't see why it's a

24

fiduciary obligation in case A -- a sponsor obligation

25

in case A and a fiduciary obligation in case B.
43
Alderson Reporting Company

That

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

just depends on the sequence of timing.

2

MS. CLARK:

Again, it's not, it's not the

3

timing.

It's the context.

In a case like this one,

4

where the employer is clearly going out of business,

5

it's talking termination, it's got annuity quotes on the

6

table, it's, everything is the implementation of the

7

termination of the plan.

8

remains in business and is continuing to employ people

9

who are going to be accruing benefits in the future,

If instead this employer

10

then that is the question of what are the benefits they

11

are going to be accruing in the future.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But what about the

13

employees who are on board at the time the merger

14

decision is made?

15

who continues to operate can say, I'm going to merge my

16

sound plan, I'm sick of having to worry about it, I'm

17

going to merge this financially sound plan into plan A

18

out here, which is very, very shaky, and I know

collapse, but I don't care.

22

Are you saying that an, an employer

Is that an option for the plan sponsor?

decision, but the plan sponsor would be subjecting

itself to obligations for future enhanced funding of the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you go back for just

2

one second to Justice Alito's question, because that's

3

what I'm having trouble with, because I think the

4

question is what, assuming you're right on all the other

5

points for argument's sake, but what is the advantage to

6

the worker here?

7

the advantage is, well, maybe the worker if he goes and

8

works in the right place will get some more money.

9

And the answer I heard you give was

Well, and I wonder is that relevant.

And

10

you told me in respect to the two insurance companies it

11

wasn't relevant.

12

the two insurance companies, how can that be relevant

13

here, and if that isn't relevant here what is the

14

possible advantage to the worker?

15

MS. CLARK:

So if it isn't relevant in respect to

Justice Breyer, I believe I was

16

cut off and didn't finish my answer to your question

17

when you asked it before.

18

annuities on the table are to be chosen, the Department

19

of Labor's instructions to employers have clearly said

20

if they're equal on the basis of safety and security of

21

the benefits, then it's appropriate for the fiduciary to

22

take other considerations into account.

23

here would be that, by parallel to that, if the

24

fiduciary were to conclude that the multiemployer plan

25

is of equal safety and security to the participants

In determining which of two

benefits that they have earned to date, it would then be

2

able to take into consideration in the interest of

3

participants any other difference.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

So then you're saying that

5

the answer -- we have annuity company A and B, they're

6

identical, the worker has a pension that promises them

7

$1,000 a month, not a penny more, and company A says,

8

we'll give you $500 extra.

9

the current regs and so forth, the administrator must

10
11

Then in your opinion under

choose that company; is that right?
MS. CLARK:

Only if the two companies are

12

equivalent in terms of their security.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I said they are equivalent

14

in terms of -- of the security and so forth; they are

15

each good companies and one will write out a check for

16

$500, which is what I thought my example was.

17

you're saying under the law the fiduciary must choose

18

the first but you're hesitating on that which means I

19

think I don't understand it fully.

20

MS. CLARK:

22

And now

I'm trying to make sure that I

understand your question fully, Justice Breyer.

So that the first decision

8

don't read 1341 the way you do.

It seems to me that

9

little (i) at the top of your page 2a is a safe harbor.

10

I don't think that the, even if it is a fiduciary

11

decision that he has to, once he has found an insurer

12

that is rock solid, that is willing to provide all the

13

benefit liabilities, I don't think he has to look

14

throughout the rest of the world to see if there is

15

anything that might be better for his plan participants.

16

I think that's a safe harbor and if he purchases an

17

irrevocable commitment from an insurer and then that

18

insurer is as solvent as any other insurer he is home

free.

consider little (ii) and see what other ways of fully

providing all benefit liabilities might be better for

First, I would like to return the Court to

2

the factual context of this case.

In this case, PACE

made not a two-step proposal, PACE proposed an outright

4

merger in which all assets and liabilities would be

5

transferred to the PACE union.

6

It's Plaintiff's trial Exhibit 25.

upon what the function is, and it doesn't matter whether

2

the business is going out of business or whether the

business is an ongoing concern.

4

it's going out of business, it's important to protect

5

the, the discretion of a plan sponsor.

If anything, because

In terms of the contextual argument it's

7

very important to note that nowhere -- that Section 1341
