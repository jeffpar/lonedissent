ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. ERIC BRUNSTAD, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule creates an

12

unwarranted Federal common law rule that exists outside

13

the structure of the Bankruptcy Code.

14

Code has a distinct structure.

15

has a right to an attorneys' fees valid under State law,

16

after the petition date, the date the debtor files for

17

bankruptcy, that right passes to the bankruptcy estate.

18

If a creditor has a State law right to attorneys' fees,

19

after the petition date, that right becomes a claim in

20

bankruptcy.

The Bankruptcy

For example, if a debtor

21

The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule intercepts

22

those rights even before we get to what the Bankruptcy

23

Code provides or does to them and basically says, if

24

you're litigating Federal issues, you simply cannot have

25

a right to attorneys' fees unless the Federal law
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authorizes that right, in this case, contractual rights,

2

or alternatively rights available under State statute.

3

That, we submit, is an impermissible

4

creation of a Federal common law rule.

5

basis for it under this Court's preemption precedents.

6

There's no conflict between Federal policy and State

7

policy which would justify the creation of the rule, and

8

accordingly, it is unwarranted.

which provides for attorneys' fees, the holder of the

14

15

holder of the note gets his attorney and says:

Is the attorneys' fees, the attorney fee for filing the

18

bankruptcy claim, recoverable as part of the claim?

Are there millions of

I mean, this seems to me fairly rudimentary.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

In our

8

reply brief, we do cite to Collier, where we talk about

9

exactly that scenario and it is described.

And it

10

basically works like this.

A claim under the Bankruptcy

11

Code is defined under Section 1015.

12

any right to payment whether it's contingent or fixed,

13

matured, unmatured, et cetera.

14

literally any right to payment, when the debtor files

15

for bankruptcy, that becomes a claim.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

it's a post-petition action.

18

MR. BRUNSTAD:

The claim includes

Any right to payment,

No, no.

If the right But in my case,

Yes, Justice Kennedy.

The

19

key concept -- and this is explained clearly in Collier

20

-- is where does the right come from?

21

of a pre-petition contract, then the right is

22

pre-petition in nature, even though the fees are

23

incurred post-petition.

24

if PG&E had guaranteed its parent's debt for the $100

25

million, let's say.

If it arises out

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Could you just back up

just for a second?

Supposing at the time of the

3

bankruptcy that the services have not been performed.

4

It's post-petition conduct by the lawyer.

5

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Right.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, in that case,

7

are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees

8

in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor

9

was insolvent?

10
11

And we're assuming insolvency in the

hypothetical, although it may not fit this case.
MR. BRUNSTAD:

Exactly, yes, Justice

12

Stevens, if in fact, though, the creditor bothers to

13

assert the claim for fees in the bankruptcy case.

14

most cases, creditors don't, because it's not worth the

15

effort of asserting the claim for fees subsequently.

16

cases such as this, where you have a solvent debtor who

17

can pay all claims in full, there's no reason why they

18

should be able to get out of their contractual

19

obligations in bankruptcy.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In

Well, why wouldn't it be

21

worth -- I know here.

22

effort, instead of getting $90 on the note, to get 95?

Well, because there's a

transaction cost in actually filing the additional claim

25

setting forth the amount that you've incurred.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

In most

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cases, Justice Stevens, creditors don't even hire

2

attorneys to pursue or file a claim in bankruptcy.

3

most Chapter 7 cases, for example, they are no-asset

4

cases.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you telling me just

6

based on your experience that in Justice Kennedy's

7

hypothetical, normally, no fees are recovered?

8
9
10
11

MR. BRUNSTAD:

In

Normally, there's no

distribution on unsecured claims in most bankruptcy
cases.

So why bother?
JUSTICE STEVENS:

But assuming in those

12

cases where there's some distribution, is it correct, as

13

I'm assuming your answer to Justice Kennedy's question,

14

that the normal practice is you don't bother because

15

there is not enough involved?

16

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Typically, Justice Stevens,

17

that is correct.

18

attorneys' fees are substantial, the debtor is solvent,

19

and there are substantial -

20

But in cases such as this, where the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just in the hypothetical,

21

I would think that in many cases, there's going to be

22

some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of

23

the note tells his attorneys:

MR. BRUNSTAD:

For the work done in

4

performing, filing the proof of claim, that's correct.

5

And even though, Justice Kennedy, the attorney's conduct

6

was after the debtor filed for bankruptcy, the right to

7

payment arises out of the pre-petition contract.

think of the guarantee hypothetical.

beginning of the case.

We don't know what's going to

happen in the future.

You must file your claim at the

beginning of the case.

have a claim at the beginning of the case.

10

that's what we're getting at.

12

and you're out of money.

13

this case, there is no inevitable claim.

14

We can understand the

The claim is inevitable.

MR. BRUNSTAD:

But that's precisely the

15

point of why claim is defined so broadly to include

16

contingent claims.

17

In

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if it is defined as

18

broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this.

19

There has been no default on the obligation, and prior

20

to getting to this Court, $167,000 has been racked up in

21

legal fees that accomplishes absolutely nothing.

22

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Absolutely false, Justice

23

Souter.

In bankruptcy, if you do not present your

24

rights, if the rights of the workers themselves are not

25

properly treated, they are lost.

Under Section 1141,

10

understand it.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but I

properly classified, that their rights were rendered

Then there was the claim that the surety
provides for having had to have done all of that work.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I don't -- there was

6

never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay

7

our workers' compensation.

8
9

MR. BRUNSTAD:

The problem, Justice

Ginsburg, is that the plan said nothing at all.

when the plan says nothing at all, the default rule in

11

bankruptcy is that rights are extinguished; they are

It must be in the

18

That is why one must come to the bankruptcy

19

court, one must file a proof of claim, one must enforce

20

your rights in bankruptcy; if you don't, you lose them.

21

That's why the surety here stepped forward, said it has

22

subrogation rights; the workers have rights.

23

bankruptcy court agreed with Travelers.

24

debtor to put that language in the plan.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the

It directed the
Travelers -

I thought there was a

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

section of the code that preserved subrogation rights.

2
3

MR. BRUNSTAD:

That's Section 509, Justice

Ginsburg.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Yes.

But that's not what I was

6

speaking of just momentarily.

The rights of the injured

7

employees, the workers, when they filed for -- when PG&E

8

filed for bankruptcy, the injured workers had claims.

9

They were going to receive periodic benefit payments off

10

into the future.

11

those claims in the bankruptcy case in their plan, those

12

claims would have been extinguished.

13

though, Travelers would not have been off the hook on

14

its surety bond, Travelers would have had to have

15

stepped forward and make the payments if PG&E did not.

16

If PG&E had not properly provided for

As a result,

But if Travelers hadn't come to the

have a right to recover, a right to payment.

22

PG&E got an order authorizing it to continue to pay but

not requiring it to pay.

That can only be done in the

plan of reorganization.

wrong -

MR. BRUNSTAD:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In -- in this case, I

12

thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification

13

is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time,

14

then the claim can be made and is not lost.

15

MR. BRUNSTAD:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

How do we

predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

I

13

apologize for focusing only on the issue that Travelers

14

was focusing on, which was whether this was, whether the

15

Fobian rule was itself cert-worthy question.

a rational predicate because, as you can see from

times, including in two point headings:

creditors have an allowable claim for post-petition

attorneys' fees, and only if you begin by reading the

code can you figure out whether the Fobian common law

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

affirmative harm that can come from this Court simply

saying, let us conclude that the Ninth Circuit was wrong

in disallowing these claims on the logic that the Ninth

Circuit followed, but we will reserve for a later day an

21

open question of law on what Section 502(b) and 506(b)

22

means.

23

overwhelmingly the lower courts in the last 10 years

24

have concluded that 502(b) and 506(b) mean that

unsecured creditors do not have these claims.

And the harm comes from the fact that

If this Court declares that it is now an
open question -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

contract provides that.

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If that's so, why isn't

20

complete answer to your position?

21

MR. SHORR:

Well, Your Honor, because

22

Congress didn't say that.

Congress gave only one answer

23

to the question whether unsecured creditors get their

24

attorneys' fees allowed, that is post-petition

25

attorneys' fees allowed.

It's either yes or no.
30

Alderson Reporting Company

There

is no on-off switch for solvent or insolvent creditors

2

within the code, which is why Travelers never argued

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They argue it in their

reply brief here.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, Your Honor, and that

is absolutely incorrect.

If you look at the case that

they cite, that case relies on a provision of the code,

9

which is Section 726.

JUSTICE BREYER:

what about their statement from Collier?
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

proposition that we don't dispute, which is whether it

The answer under the code is

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's because 506

2

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius

6

argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, Congress put

506(b) in the code for one purpose and one purpose only,

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we still have to

And your failure to defend it

here means that we're going to have to decide in on that

If you have mentioned that in an

that, and I apologize for not having raised it in the

that it doesn't apply to post-petition attorneys' fees,

But all of their arguments about Section

That's an important section because that demonstrates

that Congress understood that attorneys' fees would be

Congress did not think there was a

problem with respect to this historic practice of going

on over 100 years of attorneys' fees being allowed as

Respondents' argument about Section 506(b) renders

MR. BRUNSTAD:

Justice Stevens, what I take,

2

what I take from their analysis is a hostility towards

attorneys' fees being allowed in bankruptcy.

4

perhaps maybe as a matter of policy, if we were to start

5

from scratch, well, maybe we shouldn't allow attorneys'

6

fees to be allowed in bankruptcy.

7

allow tort claims to be allowed in bankruptcy.
