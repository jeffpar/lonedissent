6

Environmental Protection Agency versus Defenders of

Mr. Kneedler.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Section 402(b) of the Clean Water Act

14

provides that the Environmental Protection Agency shall

15

approve an application by a State to administer its own

16

NPDES program unless EPA finds that the state's program

17

does not satisfy nine criteria that are addressed to

18

whether the State has the legal authority under State

19

law to carry forward with the program.

20

There's no dispute in this case that

21

Arizona's program satisfies those criteria.

The Ninth

22

Circuit nonetheless set aside EPA's approval of

23

Arizona's program.

24

could not approve Arizona's application unless it first

25

insured that there would be in place under Arizona's

The Ninth Circuit held that EPA

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

administration protections equivalent to those that

2

would be applicable under Section 7 of the Endangered

3

Species Act when EPA itself issues permits.

4

holding is inconsistent not only with Section 402(b)'s

5

mandatory directive, it's also inconsistent with Section

6

7 of the ESA itself.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That

Do we take the case and -

8

I'll ask the same question to your colleagues from the

9

other side -- on the assumption that if the nine -- the

10

factors in the statutes are met, that EPA has no

11

discretion to withhold the transfer?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

That is our position,

13

and that I think is clear from Section 402(b).

14

that the administrator shall approve unless he finds

15

that the state legal authority criteria are not

16

satisfied.

17

reinforced by 33 U.S.C. 1251(b), which expresses a

18

strong preference for State protection of waters and in

19

particular states that it's the policy of Congress that

20

the states administer the NPDES program.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I should also point out that that's

How long has that been the

22

government's -- the EPA position?

23

been the EPA's interpretation of the statute?

24
25

It says

MR. KNEEDLER:

How long has that

Well, until 1993 when the

vast majority -- by the time -- by that time the vast
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

majority of transfers or approvals had already taken

2

place.

3

we're aware of under Section 7 of the Endangered Species

4

Act.

5

programs but after the Fifth Circuit -- from then until

6

-- until this one, but after the Fifth Circuit's

7

decision in the American Forestry case, EPA never tried

8

to impose any obligations on a State under Section 7 of

9

the Endangered Species Act.

There had never been consultation, at least that

EPA did consult with the wildlife agencies on six

10

What it did is, EPA and the Fish and

11

Wildlife Service worked out between themselves certain

12

arrangements by which EPA would look at endangered

13

species considerations, but it never conditioned the

14

approval of a State program after the Louisiana program

15

struck down in the American Forestry decision in 1998,

16

on the states having in place certain protections.

17

in fact, I think EPA would not characterize what it did

18

even in the Louisiana programs as the sort of condition

19

that the Fifth Circuit understood.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

Has that always been the

21

EPA's position?

22

the briefs that you changed your position in this Court,

23

to change the position you took even in the lower courts

24

at issue.

25

Because there's an allegation in one of

Is that MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I'm -- there may be two
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

different things that, referring to it.

2

imposes an obligation on Federal agencies in their own

3

actions not to jeopardize -- or to ensure that their

4

actions are not likely to jeopardize a species.

5

Ancillary to that, there is an obligation on Federal

6

agencies to consult with the fish and wildlife agencies.

7

As to the consultation obligation, as I mentioned, EPA

8

has engaged in consultation from 1993 until -

9
10
11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Section 7

But your position was they

didn't have to?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Our position now is that it

12

did not have to, but -- and more fundamentally our

13

position is that because the transfer or the approval of

14

the State application is mandatory if these nine legal

15

authority criteria are satisfied, EPA could not withhold

16

approval of -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

the consultation is a waste of time?

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

So your position is

Basically, yes.

If in the

20

end EPA could not disapprove the State's application,

21

and since consultation is ancillary to the substantive

22

obligation not to jeopardize -

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't there a difference

24

between denying the application because the Endangered

25

Species Act hasn't been attended to adequately, and
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

saying you meet the nine criteria, you're going to get

2

your application.

3

that the thing becomes the State's domain rather than

4

the Federal.

5

called a memorandum of agreement that's worked out, and

6

couldn't the Endangered Species Act concerns be

7

accommodated that way instead of saying one statute is

8

out the window, even though EPA in a number of states

9

has made an accommodation.

10
11
12

But then, so it's not just automatic

But isn't there something rather detailed

Why couldn't the Endangered Species Act
concerns be reflected in that memorandum of agreement?
MR. KNEEDLER:

The memorandum, the

13

memorandum of agreement, is called for under EPA's

14

regulations as really a procedural mechanism for the EPA

15

and the State agency to work out the practicalities of

16

the State's administering the program.

17

address such things as how the State agency will furnish

18

EPA draft permits and that sort of thing, time

19

limitations for EPA to look at, who to contact at the

20

State agency.

21

They typically

It's essentially procedural in order to

22

facilitate EPA's continuing oversight role.

23

vehicle for EPA to impose substantive obligations coming

24

from other statutes.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's not a

No, but the point is why
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can't it be?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Because we think that would

3

been consistent with Section 402(b), which requires,

4

which requires the EPA to approve the transfer.

5

Now, if a State agency chooses to cooperate

6

with Fish and Wildlife Service or NOAA in the Department

7

of Commerce with respect to species under its

8

jurisdiction, that is all fine.

9

out -

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I should point

Doesn't the ESA require

11

something more than voluntary cooperation?

12

quite rightly emphasize the mandatory nature of the

13

approval under the Clean Water Act.

14

Species Act mandate seems equally unconditional.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

I mean, you

But the Endangered

It's unconditional with

16

respect in our view to actions that are within the

17

agency's discretion or consequences that the agency will

18

cause.

19

question, Section 7 imposes obligations only on Federal

20

agencies, not on State agencies.

21

federalism-sensitive -

22

But more fundamentally in response to your

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Like 402(b), it is a

I realize that that's your

23

point.

But doesn't that sort of beg the question?

24

Because it's not that anyone is suggesting here, I

25

think, that under the Endangered Species Act the Federal
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government can keep control or that the Federal

2

Government can in effect provide guarantees of what may

3

happen in response to some future development proposal.

4

What I think they're arguing is that when,

5

when, when the agency gives the approval, it should

6

require that there be some kind of procedure in place on

7

the part of the State so that when problems arise the

8

States will probably respond to them with the same

9

values in mind that the feds would.

10

And the question is why cannot the

11

Endangered Species Act be enforced in that way, to

12

require, in effect, an advanced mechanism before, in

13

effect, the whole business is turned over to the States?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, as to the latter, we

15

don't believe that EPA can condition the transfer.

16

let me point out that in 2001 -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But

I know you say you don't

18

think they can do it.

19

20

seems to be, well, we'll give full effect to one and we

21

will ignore the other.

do what you can with respect to the Endangered Species

24

Act?

25

But the problem is we've got two

MR. KNEEDLER:

First of all, with respect to

the Endangered Species Act, the memorandum of agreement

2

that was entered into in 2001 between EPA and the two

Federal wildlife services does furnish a way in which

after the transfer EPA can take into account endangered

5

species considerations within the scope of its -

6
7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

have any authority left under the Clean Water Act.

8
9

At which point EPA doesn't

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, that's not correct.

Under Section 402(d) EPA has the authority to object to

10

a State permit.

11

a determination that the State permit would not satisfy

12

the guidelines and requirements of the Clean Water Act.

13

So if -

14

And if the -- but to do so on, based on

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That begs the question

15

because the concern is the enforcement of the Endangered

16

Species Act.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

With respect to water quality

18

issues that might affect an endangered species, EPA

19

takes the position -- and I think it's correct -- that

20

EPA can object to a State permit where that permit would

21

not comply with State water quality standards that are

22

necessary to protect the endangered species.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why don't they get that in

24

the memorandum of agreement up front?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

EPA doesn't need the State's
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

agreement to object to a State permit.

2

authority -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That is

Maybe it doesn't, but isn't

4

it the case that if it's in the agreement up front the

5

odds are better that the State will address it, as

6

opposed to the State ignoring the problem, requiring EPA

7

then to take affirmative action to object?

8
9
10

MR. KNEEDLER:

And I wanted to get to the

further mechanisms that are in place under EPA
regulations and the memorandum of agreement.

11

JUSTICE SOUR TER:

No, but would you answer

12

my question first?

13

going to respond or deal with the problem if they have

14

an obligation in the memorandum of agreement right up

15

front?

16

Isn't it likely that the States are

I suppose.

But let me, let me, let me

17

explain what is in place.

18

that a State furnish its draft permits to the public,

19

but also specifically to the Federal wildlife agencies.

20

EPA's regulations require

That gives Fish and Wildlife Service an

21

opportunity to comment about endangered species concerns

22

that may be raised by the draft permit.

23

The regulations also require the State

24

agency to take into account the comments that are

25

submitted by anyone, including the Fish and Wildlife
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Service and NOAA.

2

Federal agencies to bring their concerns to the State

3

agency, and I think there is every reason to believe

4

that the State agencies will -

5

Those provisions built in allow the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is there an obligation on

6

the part of the State agency to take reasonable action

7

in response to them, or can the State agency simply sit

8

there, listen with a tin ear and then do whatever it

9

wants to?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Those regulations do not

11

because they are procedural.

12

State agency does not respond to the concerns raised or

13

does not remedy the concerns raised by Fish and Wildlife

14

Service or NOAA, EPA is notified and EPA can then try to

15

work it out with the State agency, or, failing that, EPA

16

can object to the State permit if it does not satisfy

17

the Clean Water Act standards.

18

Then what happens if the

And again with respect to water quality,

19

those standards are set at a level that is necessary to

20

protect endangered species.

21

impacts are concerned, EPA retains complete control

22

under its ability to object to the permit.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So as far as water quality

You are in effect saying

24

that the, that the, that the enforcement of water

25

quality standards is, in effect, the indirect answer to
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the problem that the other side raises?

2

it's done?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

It is.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the way

EPA -

Except to the extent that a

5

project may be endangering a species, not by reason of

6

change in water quality but, for example, by destroying

7

habitat, constructing a dam or that sort of thing.

8
9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Upland habitat, if it's water

habitat, water quality standards.

EPA has to approve

10

State water quality standards.

11

and Wildlife Service and NOAA in doing so to make sure

12

endangered species would be protected by the water

13

quality standards.

14

permit is measured against those water quality standards

15

to make sure they comply.

16

It consults with Fish

And then each individual State

So therefore, with respect to water quality,

17

Fish and Wildlife Service agreed that the mechanisms I

18

have just described would take care of any Endangered

19

Species Act concerns.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you referring to, in

21

what you just described about the cooperation among the

22

Federal agencies, to what has been called in their

23

brief, it's referred to as a coordination agreement?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, the 2001, February 22,

2001, agreement between EPA and 13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that agreement, I

2

take it from what you just said, is in full force?

3

hasn't retreated from that agreement and it will

4

continue to -

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is correct.

EPA

And some of

6

the things I described were embodied in EPA regulations

7

aside from the agreement, including an agreement that

8

State agencies furnish draft permits to Fish and

9

Wildlife Service and take into account comments that are

10

received in return.

11

Justice Scalia is correct that, that the

12

impacts that would not be covered by this would be

13

non-water quality-related impacts on upland habitat.

14

But in our view that simply reflects the nature of the

15

Clean Water Act and under 402(b) it is a Clean Water

16

Act.

17

that EPA is authorized to withhold the approval or

18

condition the approval of a transfer of permitting

19

authority to a State on the basis of what the State will

20

do with respect to upland, upland habitat.

21
22
23

It deals with water quality, and we do not believe

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Which is the -- the later

act is the Endangered Species Act?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Essentially, the Endangered

24

Species -- there was a subsequent amendment to 402(b),

25

but for these purposes -- but 14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Why doesn't that control?
Because it is -- we do not

3

think it repeals -- it's essentially a repeal by

4

implication question.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you can just as

6

well say that if it does not control then there is an

7

exception by implication, the exception being based on

8

the prior act.

9

satisfactory, but neither answer gives you a reason to

10
11

Neither of them is particularly

ignore the problem.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Beyond that, Section 7 of the

12

ESA is a generally applicable statute, whereas Section

13

402(b) speaks specifically and comprehensively to the

14

question of Federal approval of State programs.

15

think this would be a particularly unlikely candidate

16

for an exception to that because EPA's approval of the

17

State program does not result in any immediate

18

on-the-ground consequences.

19

or in-the-water consequences.

20

after the transfer the State agency actually issued,

21

issued a permit.

22

We also

That would only happen That would only happen if

So what we're talking about is -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but by that very

23

reasoning you could say that if assurance are required

24

that the Endangered Species Act is going to be honored,

25

that does not in and of itself prevent any development
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

program.

2

dealing with something that may happen in the future.

3

Each, in effect, is a kind of mechanism for

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if I could go back to

4

the point I was making earlier, that we think that the

5

central thrust of the court of appeals' opinion and

6

Respondent's position here is that EPA could not

7

transfer the authority unless it and the State together

8

replicated the sort of protections that were in place

9

when EPA itself administered the Endangered Species Act.

10

And as I said, that's inconsistent not only with 402(b),

11

but with Congress's federalism-sensitive judgment, to

12

impose the sort of substantive and procedural

13

administrative requirements in Section 7 of the ESA only

14

on Federal agencies, not on State agencies.

15

And let me also stress that this does not

16

mean that the rest of the ESA is inapplicable once a

17

permitting program of the State is approved.

18

central provision of the ESA, the prohibition against

19

taking endangered species act and other provisions

20

against trading in them and importing, exporting, all

21

those remain applicable.

22

applicable provisions that prohibit the taking

23

of endangered species.

24
25

The

Those are the generally

JUSTICE BREYER:

I understand very well your

argument that if the EPA is going to transfer this, they
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

transfer it to Arizona and the first thing they say is,

2

we look at Arizona's laws and they protect everything.

3

And now we look at our own authority and if they get -

4

start mucking around with this, we can refuse the

5

permit.

6

understanding and the memorandum of understanding or

7

whatever it is, agreement or something, is going to be

8

they're going to pay as much attention as we are.

9

they'll pay attention to this, too, and if they don't we

And besides that, we have a memorandum of

11

not putting any species in jeopardy.

12

standard.

13

I paraphrased it pretty well.

14

So

So no problem; we are
We satisfy the

I've got that part of the argument.

I think

The part I don't get is then you say,

15

anyway, we don't have to do any of this because it says

16

"shall transfer," therefore, it's not discretionary,

17

it's mandatory.

18

nine standards there and it seems to me to say that is

19

rather like saying, well, the ICC used to say you shall

20

let the railroad build a spur, provided it's in the

21

public interest, convenience, and necessity.

22

That part I don't get because there are

I mean, are you suddenly saying every

23

statute that uses the word "shall" is not subject to the

24

ESA?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I think it would
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

require a statute by statute evaluation.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

4

All right, fine.
But we think this one is

particularly clear.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, my problem with saying

6

it's clear is that they have nine criteria.

One of the

7

criteria is you look to five other statutes, which they

8

have their own criteria and one of those criteria is you

9

have to be certain that the State will assure the

10

protection and propagation of a balanced population of

11

shellfish, fish, and wildlife.

12

And by the time you get through those nine

13

criteria, I don't think you'd have to be too imaginative

14

a lawyer to figure out ways that they involve everything

15

the ESA involves.

16

by the word "shall" where the ESA would apply, you would

17

think it would this be this one, which has to do with

18

water, environmental protection, nine criteria, many

19

vague, and they use words like "wildlife," "shellfish,"

20

et cetera.

21

So if there ever was an act prefaced

MR. KNEEDLER:

Several, several responses to

22

that.

Those cross-references -- first of all, 402(b)

23

looks only to whether the State has the legal report

24

under State it law.

25

certification or determination by the attorney general

Among other things, it requires a

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the State to establish that the State actually has

2

the authority to administer.

3

And the references to, cross-references to

4

fish and wildlife that come from incorporating other

5

provisions have to do with the setting of the standards

6

or setting -- under section 302, which EPA has never

7

invoked, setting certain supplementary effluent

8

standards to protect fish and wildlife.

9

standards.

Those are the

EPA does not evaluate the state's water

10

quality standards in deciding whether the State has the

11

legal authority under 402(b) to administer the program.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Of the states to whom a

13

transfer has been made how many have agreed to comply

14

with this provision of the Endangered Species Act?

15
16

MR. KNEEDLER:

I'm not sure.

I don't think

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

In the memorandum of

19

made, in some of them, is there not language in which

20

the State has agreed that we'll consult with Fish and

21

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

There was, there was in the

23

Louisiana memorandum of agreement that was involved in

24

the Fifth Circuit's American Forestry decision, and it

25

was that provision that the Fifth Circuit held was

unlawful on two grounds.

agreement basically said we're trying to do something

3

analogous to Section 7 of the ESA when the State is

4

administering the program; and the Fifth Circuit said

5

that went beyond EPA's authority by conditioning the

6

approval on the State putting in place a compensation

7

arrangement.

That, that memorandum of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You mentioned a whole

string of states, I think, Texas, Florida, Maine were

10

mentioned as states that -- in connection with the

11

transfer of the permitting authority had conditions that

12

made the Endangered Species Act applicable.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's not correct,

14

Justice -- Justice Ginsburg.

15

Circuit's decision, EPA never tried to impose on a State

16

an obligation to go forward in the same way that EPA, or

17

even in a similar way that EPA would under Section 7 of

the Endangered Species Act.

This is a

Mr. Kneedler, may I ask a

14

question about the memorandum of agreement?

15

of a new concept that I have a little difficulty

16

following.

17

That's kind

Is there -- is that, is one of the nine

18

conditions of approval that the State enter into a

19

memorandum of agreement?

20
21

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, it is -- no it is not.

The memorandum of -

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

23

that issues, that requires the states -

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is there not a regulation

Yes.

There, there's -

What's the statutory

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

authority for the regulation?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

33 U.S.C. 1314(i) allows -

3

provides -- excuse me -- for EPA to establish

4

guidelines, basic guidelines, minimum standards for

5

State programs and -- part of that -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What if -- what if the

7

State just refused to enter into a memorandum of

8

agreement?

9

refusing to transfer decision?

10

Would that, could that be a ground for

MR. KNEEDLER:

If, if the, if its refusal

11

was based on an objection to things that are within the,

12

within the legitimate scope of a memorandum of

13

agreement.

14

I think that JUSTICE STEVENS:

Just says don't want -- it

15

just says we don't want to enter into a memorandum of

16

agreement, period.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yeah.

I -- I think -- I

18

don't think EPA has ever confronted that.

19

it probably, it probably could be denied, but the

20

regulations do not -- as I recall -- specifically

21

condition the approval of the program on the memorandum

22

of agreement.

23
24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I think

-- that require the making

of a memorandum of agreement.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

I would, I would

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hesitate to say that EPA could not -- could not insist

2

on that, but it's important again to come back to the -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But how can that be

4

consistent with your shall argument?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

Because there's a separate

6

authority for the, for the, for EPA to issue guidelines

7

for minimum, minimum standards for State programs, but

8

those have to do with -- with communications with EPA

9

and sort of running a program.

And it's not a vehicle

10

as I said before for EPA to impose new substantive

11

requirements outside the Clean Water Act on the State.

12

And that's why if -- that's why if EPA insisted that a

13

State enter into a memorandum of understanding that

14

basically said we will, we will act like EPA does under

15

Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act under the

16

administration of the program, I think the, I think the

17

State agency would be entitled to decline to enter into

18

that agreement.

19

Fifth Circuit held in the American Forestry case, and to

20

what extent we agree with the American Forestry

21

decision.

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court.

6

I particularly start off with the memorandum

Justice Ginsburg's question about compliance with that

memorandum of agreement.

As opposed to upland habitat

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

There's certainly there's

nothing in the memorandum of agreement that says that.

10

But can I just add a critical point on that,

11

Justice Scalia?

12

it doesn't matter.

13

Justice Stevens's question about the change in position,

14

before the Government came to this Court, they never

15

previously suggested what they're now saying, which is

16

that Section 7(A)(2) consultation obligations and the

17

no-jeopardy prohibition don't apply at all to these

The Government's position now is that

under no obligation to even take a look at that under

Their position now is we

the seemingly mandatory requirement of Section 7.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, how do you feel -

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's not quite

4

right.

They would look at that in the context of

5

reviewing the permits that are issued by the State

6

agencies.

7

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Your Honor, and I think

8

that's where we seem to have a little bit of a

9

disconnect.

The assumption that Mr. Kneedler seems to

10

be making is the end of the consultation process that

11

Section 7 requires, not the beginning of it.

12

purpose of the consultation process is to avoid

13

conflicts with other statutory obligations, note to

14

create them, and indeed as that memorandum of agreement

15

language suggests, the consultation process has been

16

used precisely -

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

No, what he's

18

suggesting is there isn't going to be any impact on any

19

endangered species until a particular permit is issued

20

by the State agency, and that those permits are

21

submitted to the Fish and Wildlife Service for their

22

review.

23

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

That's correct, Your

24

Honor.

But to go back to the suggestion that I think

25

Justice Souter made, what the agencies have done in the
27
Alderson Reporting Company

past, and this is a situation where we don't have to

2

speculate about whether the agencies can comply with

3

those statutes.

they've consulted, if you go back and look at the

As I understood Mr. Kneedler to say that that's

5

exactly what they, what they continue to do.

6

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor, and again But that has nothing to do,

8

as the Chief was about to say before I interrupted him,

9

that has nothing to do with, with whether they have to

10

issue the NPDES authorization.

11

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

And I guess the point I'm

12

trying to make, Your Honor, is that the Court's

13

fundamental obligation when it has two statutes that

14

have shall provisions, is to see if there's a way they

15

can be reconciled and worked out.

16

is that the consultation process has been and should be

17

precisely the process where those kinds of issues will

18

be reconciled and that's exactly how this process is

19

working.

20

not use the process that 7(a)(2) calls for, in order to

21

try to avoid the problems, is to really put the cart

imaginable.

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

That's true, Your Honor,

24

but again I think what the Court may be doing is

25

assuming that this consultation process is somewhat more
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

draconian than it frequently turns out to be.

2

only outcome of the consultation process under Section

3

7(a)(2) is for the Fish and Wildlife Service to reach

some understanding with EPA, it says when these permits

are issued by the states, here are the circumstances

6

under which you're going to lodge objections, because

7

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the

And I think this

Are you -- are you saying

10

that the consultation does beyond the nine factors that

11

are listed in the statute?

12

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

No, Your Honor.

I think

13

what we're saying is that consultation goes to the

14

separate obligation under 7(a)(2) of the Endangered

15

Species Act to address the impacts on a listed species.

16

And if I could -

17
18
19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But isn't that beyond the

nine factors?
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

I don't think -- I think

20

what it is is an effort, as there's been discussion

21

here, to reconcile two obligations, both of which

22

Congress felt were important.

23

the agency has done in other circumstances.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's exactly what

I -- I understand that.

But when they sit down and they have the consultation,
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is it proper for the EPA to say now, we're consulting

2

with you, but only with respect to the nine factors, as

3

to permits that are issued by the states afterwards, but

4

then that's something else.

5

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Well, and Your Honor,

6

just on that point, I found the Government's reply brief

7

a little bit odd, because I think consistent with the

8

questioning from Justice Breyer, it acknowledges for the

9

first time that these factors do encompass some

10

consideration of wildlife impacts.

11

one side, I think it's very important to compare what

12

they're arguing now with how they dealt with other

13

cross-cutting legal obligations.

14

example, at how they dealt with the Indian trust

15

responsibility -- I'm only bringing this up by way of

16

analogy, because I think the government's position is,

17

oh, we're trying to elevate the Endangered Species Act

18

to some exalted status, and in fact all we're saying on

19

this administrative record is that's the same status

20

that they accorded to other cross-cutting legal

21

obligations.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But putting that to

If you look, for

But what is your position

as to the propriety of the EPA's saying what I've said

If they -- they say we're

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

we're only talking about the nine factors.
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

I think that my argument

3

is that the Endangered Species Act on its face says that

4

it prohibits jeopardy or the result of habitat

5

destruction, critical habitat destruction, for any

6

agency action that is authorized, funded or carried out.

7

Our view is that they should first look to the Clean

8

Water Act criteria and factors.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We think -

Well, I think you are at

10

issue with the government on that point.

11

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

We are, Your Honor.

What

12

I will say to you, with all respect, Justice Kennedy,

13

and the reason I bring up their other legal obligations,

14

and I think it also reinforces the value of a remand in

15

this case, so some of the issues raised by the

16

government's new position would be flushed out in the

17

administrative process.

18

page 203, when Native American tribes wrote to the

19

agency and said we are concerned about the impact of

20

this transfer on Native American historic properties and

21

cultural and religious attributes, the EPA did not write

22

back and say well, we're sorry, Native American tribes,

23

that doesn't fall within the nine criteria.

24
25

If you look at joint appendix,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
there any limitation?

So what is -- is

Let's say that EPA says we're all
34

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

set to approve this transfer, except OSHA sent us a

2

letter and they don't like the occupational safety rules

3

you have at the State environmental agency; so until you

4

change those rules, or enter a memorandum of agreement

5

that you're going to change those rules, we're not going

6

to approve the transfer.

7

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

I think the line, Your

8

Honor, is whether you've got another crosscutting

9

obligation -

act.

they're not doing it.

Yeah, like the OSHA

So EPA can leverage their

Again, Your Honor, I

15

think the first problem is, with that question is that,

16

I don't mean to be evasive, but I think the problem is

17

you're assuming the outcome of the analysis, which is

18

that they'll have to impose some new condition on the

19

State.

20

that.

21

They said we'll have an agreement with the Native

have to impose the obligation as a condition of

approval.

3

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Yeah.

And what I will

4

say, Your Honor, is we think that in the past they have

5

been able to work these problems out.

6

can't, I think it's important to recognize that Congress

7

created a mechanism precisely for the very

8

rare situation where there is -

But if they

That isn't the -- what I'm

10

It's a cactus.

So can you take that into account?

Is that

20

theoretical?

I think they're trying to raise this

21

question of, suppose you know the IRS, that if you mail

22

a refund check at the time, the person who gets it is

23

going to use the $500 to destroy the last salamander in

24

the world.

25

Does the Act apply to the IRS?

Okay?

Now there we are, endangered species.
I would have thought the

answer's no.

3

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

The answer is no, Your

Honor.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

thought the same reasoning is true here, but what the

Act tells you to do is read your existing authority, but

7

read it in light of informed by the endangered species

And now I wonder if with that approach, is

10

it possible that even the cactus could fall within the

11

nine criteria?

12

you're going to read them generously in light of the

13

objective of the Endangered Species Act, which is itself

14

an environmental objective.

15

Can you do that?

16

do it?

You're not going to depart from them but

Now how does that work?

You're an imaginative lawyer.

17

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

you can.

20

this Court?

21

going to agree with that.

22

therefore, it applies.

Can you

Well, I think you can.
All right.

The answer is

Then are you satisfied with this result in
One, it can be read that way.

They're not

It can be read that way, and

The ESA, the Endangered -

23

Two, that means they consult.

24

But three, the result of the consultation

25

here which has been done means there's no real objection
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the transfer, because it's virtually inconceivable

2

given the weapon that the EPA has, withdrawing permits,

3

given a memorandum of agreement, given the possibility

4

of supervision, given the fact that the wildlife service

5

will object, writing them a letter or a phone call

6

immediately, given all that stuff, there's simply no

7

reason to believe that Arizona will fail to protect

8

endangered species.

9

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

I think that's a good

10

summary of what has happened with these consultations,

11

and on the cactus -

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what's your view of an

opinion that roughly wrote what I just said?

14

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Well, I think the concern

15

I would have is that I think it goes beyond what's

16

necessary here because we're not dealing, everybody

17

agrees, with some purely ministerial situation like that

18

one.

19

I think the other critical factor here, Your

20

Honor, that we haven't talked about, is the funding of

21

this program.

22

government points out, if I can just get across to the

23

Court I think a critical citation, because the

24

government says funding is not before us.

25

reason they say that is because it didn't need to be

And it's very interesting when the

38
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

before us when they took the position that authorization

2

of the program was sufficient to trigger their

3

consultation duties.

4

brief, they say pay no attention to funding, which is of

5

course a discretionary activity, because that's

6

completely separate from the decision to authorize.

7

you look at 40 C.F.R. Section 123.23(3), and I

8

apologize -- this is a response to their reply brief

9

point so there's not any appendix before the Court -

And in a footnote in their reply

but it specifically provides that funding opportunities

are part and parcel of the decision to authorize the

15

I don't know what you're

Funding of what?

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Funding of the NPDES

16

program carried out by Arizona that had to be approved

17

in order to allow -

18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How does the government

fund it?

20

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

They have to -- there's a

21

-- Section 106 of the Clean Water Act provides the EPA

22

with an opportunity, and it's certainly not mandatory,

23

to provide funding to a State.

24

percent Federal -- we're not talking about de minimis

25

funding.

And this is 40

So it's one thing for the State to say well,
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it should get the program.

2

funding.

3

argument we're making to reinforce the propriety of

4

remand in this case.

5

It's another thing to say

And just to be clear about this, this is an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you -- you have

6

other -- let's assume that I disagree with you on

7

whether they could withhold approval of the NPDES

8

transfer.

9

making now is that apart from that approval, there were

10

other discretionary actions taken here, one of which is

11

this funding; and another one of which, I believe, is

12

whether -- never mind the MOAs, but -- I have it written

13

down here, one of the other ones.

14

permits would be transferred to State authority or not.

15

And that is apparently discretionary and can be -- what

16

do we do about that?

17

Even so, I think you -- the point you're

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Oh, whether existing

Well, we suggest, Your

18

Honor -- and I think this goes back to Justice Stevens's

19

question about the change in position.

20

an odd position in this Court quite frankly because we

21

have an administrative record where the administrator

22

conceded a duty to comply with Section 7 of the

23

Endangered Species Act.

24

saying they don't.

25

example you came up with is a good reason why a common

I think we're in

We have a new position here

And we think funding and the other

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sense result in this case is to say we have a change in

2

position, there are new issues brought to the fore.

3

a consequence of that -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question

5

about changing position?

6

that the nine statutory criteria are satisfied?

Have you agreed and conceded

7

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

on that point.

13
14

As

Your Honor, let me be

We never conceded that.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What

What is your view now?

Are they or are they not?

15

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

I think that there are

16

actually arguments that, especially with regard to the

17

wildlife related parts of the criteria, that are not

18

satisfied.

19

didn't feel it necessary to argue that in the court of

20

appeals.

21

Let me -- let me try to explain why we

JUSTICE BREYER:

Before you say why you

22

didn't argue it, it's exactly that point I sort of

23

expected you might agree when I though maybe you have

24

hooks to hang the NSA, the Endangered Species Act on.

25

But it was the other half, which I think is what
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Justice Stevens is saying now.

I read through this

2

record, not completely but pretty well, and I couldn't

3

find a single thing that would suggest that Arizona

4

presents any risk to you.

5

an endangered species that you're actually worried about

6

there?

7

agree with that, but I want to press you to find out

8

what actually is the problem.

9

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

And so, what is the risk to

And you rather -- I didn't think you'd like to

If I can give Your Honor

10

some citations to the record, I think it will help

11

answer that.

12

and Wildlife Service biologists, the expert agency

13

employees, said that there would be significant effects

14

to survival and recovery of listed species through a

15

destruction, degradation and fragmentation of habitats.

16

They specifically pinpointed the flycatcher, the

17

southwestern willow flycatcher is a species that could

18

be devastated.

19

On page 54 of the joint appendix, the Fish

That's at page -

JUSTICE BREYER:

And how would that happen?

20

How would it happen that they would get rid of the

21

flycatcher in Arizona, considering the fact that they

22

have laws themselves that protect endangered species,

23

and that's a bird, and a bird is wildlife; and so if

24

they decide they want to kill all their flycatchers,

25

which I would doubt, you could intervene at EPA and stop
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

them.

So how is that actually a problem?
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Your Honor, the concern

3

that they had was that the mechanism that had been used

4

to protect these wildlife species, and particularly

5

plant species, which I want to get to in a moment,

6

because I think actually the concern is even greater

7

with plants, was that the consultation on federally

8

issued permits had in effect been used, and this was not

9

conjectural, they had been used to safeguard

10

considerable habitat for these species.

11

turn actually to the water level, which is I think

12

actually our best example, and -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if I could

I mean, that's not enough.

14

Why wouldn't -- what would lead you to believe that it

15

wouldn't -- that the same would not happen when the

16

State issued the permits?

17

reason why we don't trust Arizona to do what the Federal

18

government's doing.

19

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

20

question of trusting them.

21

of the consultation -

22

I mean, you have to show some

Your Honor, it is not a

I think part of the outcome

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well then, you have to

23

establish jeopardy.

You have to establish jeopardy.

24

And the mere fact that you're giving it to a State which

25

Congress has been willing to trust with implementing
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

this law is not enough to show that there's jeopardy.

2

Prima facie, we would expect Arizona to do the right

3

thing.

4
5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Just as a technical matter,

don't they have to show there's no jeopardy?

6

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The

7

burden is on the Agency in the consultation process.

8

And it's at, as TVA versus Hill makes clear, the benefit

9

of the doubt is accorded to the species.

10

But, could I

try to answer that question?

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Yes.

We're not saying we don't

13

trust the State.

14

one these prior consultation processes has been where

15

it's appropriate, the service works had an agreement

16

with the State where it says here are our concerns where

17

the expert Federal agency, we listed these species, you

18

didn't.

19

fact, if the State comes back and says we understand,

20

we'll deal with that problem, that is one aspect of a

21

consultation process that the government is now saying

22

we should never have to go through.

23

And In fact, one of the outcomes of

Part of it's expertise, not trust.

And in

On the plants however, Your Honor, there is

24

a very serious concern.

In this respect the service

25

biologists said we have protected these plants' habitats
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

through the Section 7 mechanism.

2

acknowledges that it has no law or regulation which

3

forbids the destruction of federally listed plant

4

species.

5

The State of Arizona

Section 9 of the Endangered Species Act,

6

which Mr. Kneedler brought up and said it was the most

7

important provision, and I would beg to differ.

8

Sweet Home, both the majority and dissenting opinions

9

agree that Section 7 -- and Hill -- that Section 7 is

I think

10

the most important provision.

11

protected generally by Section 9 of the Endangered

12

Species Act, the take provision, except when they're on

13

Federal lands.

But plant species are not

So we have a situation where the service

And that

Official - Subject to Final Review

review by EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service.

2

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

With regard to the plant,

3

Your Honor, EPA's position to date has been that they do

4

not have the authority to protect that plant species

5

under their Clean Water Act authorities.

6

disagree with that, but that is the position they've

7

taken so far.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

That's correct, Your

Honor.

12
13

The position that

EPA has taken.

10
11

Now we may

Under their

authority.

14

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Under their Clean Water

15

Act authority, which is what informs their oversight

16

activities.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So how does it

18

matter whether they have it or if it's transferred to

19

Arizona?

20

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Because again, what the

21

consultation process is designed to accomplish, either

22

through the funding, discretionary decision that was

23

made, other mechanisms that can come into play, the idea

24

behind the consultation on the transfer -- and I think

25

this is critical to our position -- is to say if we're
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not going to be able to protect the species through the

2

State issuance of the permits and the other authorities

3

we have, what understanding can we come to, consistent

4

with our -

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

7

-- other obligations to

protect the plant species.

8
9

I don't understand -

JUSTICE SCALIA:
answer.

I don't understand that

The Chief Justice is asking, if EPA cannot do

10

it itself, how is it creating any jeopardy in

11

transferring the authority to somebody else who can't do

12

it?

13

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your Honor, what the I mean, if you assume that

15

EPA can't protect these plant species under its

16

legislation, what harm is there in transferring the

17

authority to somebody else who can't protect it?

18

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Well, I should just first

19

say that we disagree with the premise of that question.

20

In terms of EPA's position, we happen to think that EPA

21

can protect those kind of plant species, and I think

22

that's one of the additional bases s for a remand.

23

But I think the more important answer to

24

Your Honor's question is that the Fish and Wildlife

25

Service biologist said in this administrative record
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the loss of those protections was an indirect

2

effect of the transfer, that because we have used these

3

protections when we've issued Federal permits to prevent

4

species like these plant species from going extinction

5

-- and this was not speculative -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the EPA can protect the

7

plants when the permit is under its own jurisdiction,

8

why can't it use that same basis for objecting when it's

9

under the State's jurisdiction?

10

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Your Honor, that's an

11

awfully good question.

12

should have been one of the outcomes of the

13

consultations.

14

And in fact we believe that

On the transfer.

If one of the results of

15

the transfer -- and I think this was -- I think what's

16

happening is that the government has basically assumed

17

the answer to the consultation before we've gotten to

18

that point.

19

They've assumed JUSTICE ALITO:

What's the difference

20

between Arizona's situation and all the other States

JUSTICE ALITO:

Just to be clear,

It imposes an obligation on

You say it imposes an

obligation on EPA to require the States to consult.
MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

We don't disagree with

8

that either, Your Honor.

We believe that there are

9

mechanisms that have been used in past consultations,

10

especially after the Louisiana decision that came down,

11

which involve the State not at all, which involve only

12

the Fish and Wildlife Service and the EPA recognizing

13

how they would exercise their -

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I still don't understand the

15

difference between what you think is going to happen in

16

Arizona and what is happening in all the other States

17

that issue permits.

18

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Your Honor, we're not

19

saying that -- particularly with regard to Texas,

20

Florida, Oklahoma, Louisiana and other States that have

21

gone through the consultation process, we're not saying

22

that anything different should happen.

23

through a full consultation process, agree on mechanisms

24

that can protect these species.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

We're saying go

No, in the issuance of a
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

permit in any of these States, pick any State you like,

2

what is the difference between what you envision would

3

happen in Arizona, if Arizona can issue permits, and

4

what's happening in these other States?

5

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

Again, with regard to

6

consultation with Arizona, all we're asking for and all

7

we've ever asked for in this case, and this was what the

8

service biologist said, was use the consultation process

9

to agree on measures that can be put in place

10

post-transfer that will prevent the species from going

11

extinct.

12

That's what happened JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I ask you to follow up

13

on that?

14

short and I'd like to get away from some of the

15

specifics and back to the general.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And how will they put those

12

MR. GLITZENSTEIN:

They would put those

13

mechanisms in legal form either through memorandum of

15

separate agreements between EPA and the Fish and

16

suggest was -- I think if in the end of the day you look

21

at all of these opportunities to protect species and you

22

say there's nothing we can do about it and the State

23

refuses to cooperate, you have what's called jeopardy or

24

destruction of critical habitat, and Congress said that

25

the mechanism for working out the conflict with another
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

law is the endangered species committee, which we have

2

not talked about very much.

3

That was Congress's answer.

But what I was trying to suggest was, long

4

before you get to that point and without imposing a

5

single obligation on the State, simply using the

6

authority under 402(d) of the Clean Water Act, which

7

provides for this oversight opportunity, the service and

8

the EPA can come to their own understanding as to how

9

EPA will in fact carry out its post-transfer review of

10

these.

And we think that is, that is an acceptable

11

answer to the question.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice:

19

First, with respect, stepping back and

20

looking at the legal theory, we think that this case is

21

really on all fours with the Public Citizen case.

22

fact, the court of appeals recognized that the operative

23

regulation here, the definition of "indirect effect,"

24

meaning something caused by the agency, is just like the

25

one in Public Citizen.

In

In Public Citizen this Court
53

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

held that where an agency has a mandatory duty and does

2

not have the ability to control subsequent events, that

3

the agency cannot be regarded as the legal cause of

4

whatever effects happen.

5

That is exactly the case here.

Section 402(b) mandates that EPA approve the

6

State's application.

7

therefore is not the legal cause of any effects that

8

might happen with respect to endangered species.

9

EPA therefore, EPA's decision

I should point out that in this Court's

10

decision in Sweet Home this Court in footnotes 9 and 13

11

read the other principal provision of the ESA, the take

12

provision, to incorporation a proximate cause

limitation.

authority, not ancillary matters addressed under the

11

There was no challenge to that

This was a challenge to the transfer of

agreement.
Also, footnote 18 of the court of appeals

12

opinion makes clear that Respondents did not challenge

13

anything to do with funding, which is an entirely

14

separate administrative determination that there's a

15

regulatory set of criteria for how funding gets

16

distributed, it is not dependent on whether the State

17

has NPDES authority.

18

has a separate funding mechanism for Clean Water Act

19

authority generally.

20

simply not in the case.

21

Section 106 of the Clean Water Act

So funding is simply not, it's

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it's in your

22

discretion -- your distinction to the snail darter case

23

is that the decision to built the dam is discretionary,

24

not mandatory?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and in fact this Court's
55

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decision in Hill can't be understood in any other day

2

because the Court went out of its way to say that, while

3

Congress committee reports indicated, for the

4

appropriations bills, indicated an expectation that the

5

dam would be built, the Court emphasized the fact that

6

there was no mandate in the appropriations statute

7

itself.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you mean the executive

can ignore earmarks?

10
11

That would have been -

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

That part of the

Court's decision would have been unnecessary.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's a mandatory

decision?

No, what's a discretionary decision?

want, like you or me.

a "shall"; there are always criteria.

MR. KNEEDLER:

I've never heard of an

There are always criteria.

But there are few statutes

19

like this, that say the agency shall unless certain

20

things happen.

Write

JUSTICE BREYER:

You mean is it the word

22

"unless," because here we have nine and they're broad.

23

Probably with funding we have 32.

24

others we have 14.

Maybe with some

But I can't get my mind around -

MR. KNEEDLER:

applications of the standard, but that did not deter

2

this Court in Public Citizen, where the Court applied

3

the same principle and said where the agency has a

4

mandatory duty and no discretion it is not the legal

5

cause.

6

other cases where that general principle has to be

7

applied, there will be time enough for that

8

consideration to arise.

That's the general principle.

If there are

Another important aspect of Hill is this

10

Court quoted Representative Dingell, the sponsor of it,

11

saying that agencies are to take actions within their

12

power, which suggest that -- and we think it's clear

13

through the history, as we recite in our brief at pages

14

27 and 28, from the text of the Act and from the

15

evolution of Section 7, it was always understood to

16

apply to situations where the agencies had the existing

17

authority to take action, not to require them to

18

countermand statutory directives the way the Department

19

of Transportation could not countermand statutory

20

directives in Public Citizen.

21

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.
