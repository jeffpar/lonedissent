ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. AINSA:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

The Defendant, in unequivocal language of

12

section 1346, waives sovereign immunity and permits a

13

refund suit by a third party such as Petitioner.

14

conclusion that I've stated to the Court was supported

15

by the holding in United States versus Williams.

16

case, as the Court well knows, dealt with a situation in

17

which the Government sought to recover money through a

18

tax lien as opposed to a tax levy, which is the

19

situation in this case.

Because there was no

It was only a lien.

3

MR. AINSA:

It was a lien case, and of

4

course, 7426 involves a levy.

But nonetheless, the

5

holding that I have read in that case very definitively

6

deals with the breadth of section 1346.

7

of section 1346, according to the holding and United

8

States vs. Williams, is certainly broad enough to

9

encompass a third party like Petitioner.

And the breadth

I do not view

10

the fact that 7426 was not available to be a controlling

11

issue because the question was whether or not 1346 would

12

permit a third party to bring a refund action.

13

was the holding of the court as I read that opinion.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that

But when Congress

15

provides a special remedy for a particular class of

16

persons, that special remedy usually excludes a more

17

general provision.

7426, Congress never made that remedy expressly

22

vs. Williams that if section 1346 was made available to

third parties, like Mrs. Williams, it would render

So the two statutes can live in harmony and can

The Government does cite

Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do

12

MR. AINSA:

Justice Kennedy, I don't believe

13

that's been applied in the tax code, but I can answer

14

your question, I think, by saying this.

18

to do so.

Congress knows how to

In this case, it was not done.
And I would also like to point out that

20

after the decision in United States vs. Williams,

21

Congress amended 7426 to add a special provision.

And

22

in that special provision, it was made exclusive.

And I

23

use that to exemplify the fact that Congress can, when

24

it wants to, make a tax provision exclusive.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In the law, we don't -- we
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision

2

of its whole purpose and effect.

3

the purpose of this especially short statute of

4

limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose

5

of the property that it has seized, and to be able to

6

give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you

7

know, many years later and saying this property should

8

not have been taken.

9

indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a

How is that purpose served if

longer statute?

11

MR. AINSA:

Justice Scalia, 7426 has four

12

different components.

13

pre-deprivation type remedies.

14

a taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to

15

prohibit the Government from either selling property or

16

conducting a levy.

17

Two of the components are clearly
They are the ability of

Those are clearly pre-deprivation.

The other two are primarily post deprivation

18

remedies.

And so the object that the Government was

19

trying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it

20

from a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis.

21

don't believe that the Government's underlying purpose

22

is in any way diminished when the two statutes can live

23

in harmony.

24

expressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346

One of them -- you're not

MR. AINSA:

Petitioner is not challenging

the underlying assessment against the taxpayer.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And isn't that the basic

14

difference between the two statutes, that one of them

15

deals with a fight about how much money the taxpayer

16

owes, and the other one deals with the method of

17

collection.

18

MR. AINSA:

7426 clearly prevents a person

19

from contesting the underlying assessment, whereas in

20

1346, that is possible.

21

enough because it uses the term collected.

22

like in Williams, we are not seeking to contest the

23

underlying assessment.

24
25

But in this case, 1346 is broad

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And just

But it does seem to me if

you think of the two statutes as performing rather
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

separate functions, one primarily focused at the method

2

of collection, the other the amount of tax, makes quite

3

good sense to have different statute of limitations for

4

the two, because there is an interest in the prompt

5

resolution of the former issue that doesn't apply to the

6

latter.

7

MR. AINSA:

Justice Stevens, there is

8

certainly -- Government has demonstrated by -- or

9

Congress has demonstrated by passing 7426, that there is

10

an interest in a shorter statute of limitations in

11

certain cases.

12

However, I return to my original argument

13

that if 1346 is broad enough to encompass third party

14

refund suits, and if Congress has not made 7426

15

exclusive, the two statutes should be allowed to

16

coexist.

17

will not preempt statutes without a very clear

18

expression from Congress.

19

knew how to do it after the Williams case.

This Court has held on other occasions that it

20

And Congress, once again,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I suppose -- tell me

21

if I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong

22

-- but there is this difference also that in a refund

23

suit, you have to pay the money.

24

money before you can bring the refund suit.

25

about that?

The Government has the

Alderson Reporting Company

Am I right

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. AINSA:

That is correct.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Incidentally, I'm just

3

curious, if the underlying assessment -- if you wished

4

to have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a

5

million dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the

6

refund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or

7

do you have to pay the whole amount?

8

MR. AINSA:

The whole amount.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about the

10

underlying principle that waivers of sovereign immunity

11

are strictly construed.

12

the broader statute, but shouldn't you read them

13

together with the specific to suggest that they weren't

14

waiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute

15

governed, except to the extent of the provisions in that

16

more specific statute.

MR. AINSA:

And when you have a waiver on

Mr. Chief Justice, when I read

18

the opinion in United States vs. Williams, the Nordic

19

case was brought up by the dissent in that case, that

20

there must be an absolutely unequivocal waiver of

21

sovereign immunity in order to allow a particular suit

22

against the United States.

23

versus Williams was that 1346 was sufficiently broad.

24

And given that holding, and given the fact that the

Government was asserting that Mrs. Williams had other

where Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the

In the case of

Well, the whole case was

21

about whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having

22

voluntarily paid the tax.

23

MR. AINSA:

In this case, the levy was an

24

involuntary act on the part of the Government to take

25

the money from EC Trust, from the deposit that was put
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

up.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

It was an

3

involuntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped

4

forward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that

5

she was the taxpayer.

6

MR. AINSA:

Justice Ginsburg, the situation

7

in Williams, however, involved the tax lien.

8

Mrs. Williams would not have paid the tax had the

9

Government not asserted the tax lien and forced her to

10

pay the tax out of the proceeds of the house when it was

11

sold.

12

that I'm talking about.

13

It was no more voluntary than a levy in the sense

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why isn't the obvious

14

difference -- I may have missed this -- but you say, in

15

the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government

16

via a lien took property from a different person who

17

then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the

18

lien and wanted it back.

19

exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy.

20

you say if the first could sue so could the second.

And in this case they did
So

21

But the difference, the obvious difference,

22

which maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in

23

the second case, namely this case, there is a specific

24

statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine

25

months, and in the other case there wasn't such a
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute.

Why isn't that the obvious difference?

2

MR. AINSA:

Justice Breyer, the answer is

3

because 1346 also permits a third party to bring a

4

refund action.

5

is a specific statute dealing with levies, 1346 was held

6

to be broad enough to -- to encompass the refund action.

7

It is not restricted even though there

JUSTICE BREYER:

Encompasses a lien for a

8

refund action in the case where you took the property

9

via a lien.

And you'd say -- they say, I guess, but it

10

doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy.

11

not?

12

said.

13

that.

14

Why

Because of the specific, the same thing I just
Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to

MR. AINSA:

My answer to that is there is no

15

substantive distinction between a levy and a lien.

16

that while Williams dealt with a lien, and I fully

17

understand that, the taking by the Government was just

18

as involuntary under the levy as it is with a lien.

19

once section 1346 is deemed to be broad enough or held

20

to be broad enough to encompass a refund action, it

21

should encompass an action by the levy.

22

Essentially I'm arguing that the two

23

statutes can coexist together and should coexist

24

together in the absence of a clear declaration from

25

Congress that 7426 is exclusive.

I can support my

13
Alderson Reporting Company

And

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

argument by the fact that after Williams, Congress did

2

make, did amend 7426 and did make a specific new remedy

3

and they're exclusive.

4

the time 7426 was originally enacted in 1966 but did not

5

do so.

6

Congress could have done that at

JUSTICE BREYER:

If your interpretation is

7

correct then are there many such cases where the

8

Government takes property via a levy and the person who

9

wants to sue would get worried about nine months,

10

because obviously he would think I can sue under a -

11

kind of thing.

12

where he would have to worry about nine months?

It's two years.

13

MR. AINSA:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So are there still some

No.
In other words, are -- in

15

your interpretation, does the nine-month statute become

16

meaningless?

17

MR. AINSA:

It, it does not become

18

meaningless because 7426 offers certain remedies that

19

are clearly post deprivation such as filing for an

20

injunction to stop the levy, filing for an injunction to

21

stop a foreclosure.

22

and would fall within the nine-month period but

23

essentially Congress has permitted two different

24

complementary actions to seek a refund.

25

Those are still viable under 7426

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's why the code has

15

that nine-month period instead of the two-year or in

16

fact four-years because you have to go to the

17

administrative process first.

18

nine-months is to get people to act quickly.

19

MR. AINSA:

The whole purpose of the

But I can say to you that with

20

some degree, I think, of sound legal argument, that once

21

1346 was found to have unequivocally waived sovereign

22

immunity for third party refund actions in the context

23

of a lien it should also follow that it waived sovereign

24

immunity for levies because there is no fundamental

25

legal difference between the manner in which the money
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is extracted from the third party.

2

core logic of the decision in United States vs. Williams

3

is that money was involuntarily taken from Mrs. -- from

4

Mrs. Williams.

5

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There is no, the

It doesn't seem to me that

6

the fact that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity

7

with regard to levies answers the statute of limitations

8

question.

9

but the question is how long does the -- how promptly do

10

Sure, there is a waive of sovereign immunity,

you have to act?

11

MR. AINSA:

Justice Stevens, the -- the

12

issue of the statute of limitations I believe is

13

dependent upon whether or not 1346 provides for

14

remaining a viable method of seeking a refund.

15

position is that if 1346 does provide that in the

16

context of a levy, then you have in effect two statutory

17

schemes which coexist; one is 7426 and one is 10 - uh,

18

1346.

19

there is a refund provision that could be sought under

20

either one of them, but 7426 is distinctly different in

21

that it offers pre-deprivation relief that is not

22

offered under 1326.

23

And my

It is true that they overlap in the sense that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Getting back to my earlier

24

question, if there is a million-dollar tax liability,

25

and there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do

the refund suit?

difference.
Yes.

7

million dollars, it was $3 million and the entire amount

8

was paid in order to bring the refund suit.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if the amount wasn't

10

paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the

11

assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized

12

by the Government.

13

is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to

14

satisfy the tax?

15

Would the 1346 action still lie?

MR. AINSA:

Or

1346 in my view would not apply

16

to that situation, in that if property was seized and

17

used to, under a tax lien, if that was seized and the

18

Government proceeded to sell, then the third party,

19

Petitioner, would have to file for an injunction to stop

20

the foreclosure sale under 7426.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's the, it seems to

22

me the principal problem that the Government was facing

23

and justified the short statute, wasn't it?

24

need to get, to be able to convey clear title to this

25

property that it has seized.

That is the

But once -- once the money

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

is put up, and what the Government has taken is in

2

effect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in

3

proceeding under 1346.

4

MR. AINSA:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

MR. AINSA:

Justice Scalia I'm helping you.

There is no harm in proceeding

7

under 1346 once the money is paid because you're dealing

8

with a simple refund action.

9

trying to stop a foreclosure suit or stop a levy.

10
11

You're not dealing with

You're dealing with a simple foreclosure action.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but there may

12

be situations where the Government, having levied,

doesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies

16

proceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have

17

left the country, may have dissipated the funds that

18

they would otherwise go after.

19

on that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have

20

levied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a

21

short statute to clear that up as soon as possible.

22

And if you then allow a challenge to

MR. AINSA:

They need to know early

Mr. Chief Justice, there is

23

rationale for having a short statute, but once again I

JUSTICE BREYER:

And with that

The -- the, the statute

that you point to talks about taking a civil action

against the United States.

When there has been a

wrongful levy, is that right?

12

MR. AINSA:

7426.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say an

14

injunctive action.

So I would reading it think it

15

encompasses both actions for injunctions, which are

16

rare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an

17

action for damages or money back.

18

the statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people

19

are just suing to get back some money, and it says our

20

nine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless.

21

All it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are

22

far and few between.

You can tell me I'm wrong on that.

MR. AINSA:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. AINSA:

You want to say no to that.

In the Williams case, the very

10

same argument was raised, that 7426 would be rendered

11

meaningless if, and other, the quiet title action and

12

other actions would be rendered meanings less if 1346

13

was construed to allow Mrs. Williams to have a third

14

party action.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why would it have?

Because

16

there I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't

17

cover liens, the specifics statute.

18

MR. AINSA:

The Government contended that

19

Mrs. Williams had remedies available to her, certainly

20

not a levy, because there was no levy, but the

21

Government was contending she could have sought relief

22

under the Quiet Title Act.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

She could never complete a

MR. AINSA:

6

you've found that in the opinion.

7

I'm pointing out that the Government was contending that

8

the Quiet Title Act was available to Mrs. Williams, and

9

also that she could have simply put the money up.

10

-- put the money up, and the land would have been

11

released and there was an argument over whether the

secretary would have discretion to turn her down.

the point is there were other remedies out there, and

they were not deemed -

Justice Ginsburg, I, I know

statute there enacted after the more general statute?

MS. MAYNARD:

Both of those statutes, it's

5

been a long time, Your Honor.

6

--

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not, I'm not totally

The reason I ask is we -

8

we do have a principle which I think is a sound one,

9

that repeals by implication are not fatal.

And what

10

you're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow

11

statute impliedly repeals the cause of action that

12

existed under 1346.

13

that you cite, even those outside of the Internal

14

Revenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted

15

after the general statute that they supposedly limit?

16
17

Do you know if any of your cases

MS. MAYNARD:

I'm not sure if they answer

that precise question, but -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, I guess -

-- the implied repeal analysis

20

is not the proper analysis to apply here, because the

21

proper principle is that the specific remedy forecloses

22

resort to the more general remedy, when two things are

23

true.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's certainly true

when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously.
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Or even when the, when the general is enacted after the

2

more specific one and does not thereby limit the more

3

specific one.

4

But, well -

MS. MAYNARD:

In -- in this Court's case, if

5

I can answer your, the principle of your question, Your

6

Honor, which is that the replied repeal doctrine is not

7

the proper analysis here because the specific controls

8

the general.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

If 7426 had not been

10

enacted, wouldn't this case have fallen within 1346 as

11

interpreted by Williams.

12

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, we would certainly have

13

a more difficult argument here if that were the case,

14

Your Honor.

15

didn't answer the question at issue here, because it

16

only held that a person who had been subjected to a

17

lien, involuntarily paid it under duress, could be a

18

taxpayer within the meaning of 1346.

answer the question here, which is whether or not when

20

Congress has provided specifically for parties in

21

Petitioner's situation and created a remedial scheme

22

that would be wholly frustrated -

23

But Williams' specific withholding was -

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it didn't

What could you point to in

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. MAYNARD:

That would be a difficult

argument to make, that it doesn't fall within the

the same case in A.S. Kreider.

5

language in A.S. Kreider, the erroneously collected tax.

6

Yet the Court held that the more specific refund statute

7

of limitations there applied.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that was

That was the same

But if this case would have

fallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams until -

10

then you must be arguing that 1346 was in part impliedly

11

repealed when 7426 was enacted.

12

MS. MAYNARD:

One can look at it that way,

13

Your Honor.

14

then I think this Court's cases in Brown and Block are

15

how you apply the implied repeal analysis when a

16

specific statute would be wholly fully frustrated by

17

application of a more general statute.

18

particularly true where it's uncertain at the time

19

Congress enacted the specific statute.

20

But I think if one looks at it that way

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's

I don't, I don't see how

21

you can say there's frustration.

Perhaps I'm missing

something.

schemes.

7

So these are two different schemes and here

So those are two very different

Am I wrong about that?
MS. MAYNARD:

Well, they are two very

8

different schemes, Your Honor, and one is for the

9

situation that Petitioner faces, which is a third party

10

whose property is levied upon to collect the taxes of

11

another, and it has its own venue provisions, its own

12

jurisdictional provisions, its own short statute of

13

limitations.

MS. MAYNARD:

Not -- I think, Your Honor,

22

the Flora requirement, which is a judicially

23

interpretation on the refund statute which requires you,

a taxpayer to pay all of its tax liability for a given

7

wrongful levy statute has a short statute of limitations

8

for the precise reason that if we seize the property of

9

the trust the Government needs to know promptly if the

We

It believes the trust is a

10

trust claims it's not the taxpayer's property because

11

the Government, as the Chief Justice indicated, will

12

cease going after the taxpayer if it believes it has

13

already collected the tax from someone else that it

14

believes to be holding the money for the taxpayer, which

15

is different and crucially different than in a refund

16

suit, as Justice Stevens alluded to, because in a refund

17

suit where the taxpayer brings the challenge and has

18

paid the tax, at the end of that suit either the

19

Government has to pay the money back to the taxpayer in

20

a refund or the Government gets to keep the tax and

21

that's the end of the matter.

22

In a third party challenge, whether the

23

third party brings it pre- deprivation or

24

post-deprivation, the Government's interest is knowing

25

whether or not the third party has taxpayer property or

the expression suspension of the Government's period of

time that it can pursue the taxpayer.

7426 expressly suspends the time period during the

running of a third party challenge whether that's pre or

9

post deprivation.

10

Because if it turns out that it's not the

And Congress accounted for that not only in

The, the section

In addition, the -- if I can go back to

11

Justice Scalia, I would like to impress upon you why we

12

don't believe the implied repeal doctrine is applicable

13

here, and not only is it because the specific controls

14

the general when it would be wholly frustrated as it

15

would be here by both the statute of limitations

16

provision and its express suspension, but also because

17

the availability of the general remedy was uncertain at

18

the time that Congress passed -- and for the purposes of

19

the implied repeal doctrine that's the proper analysis:

20

What did the 1966 Congress think it needed to say in

10

what the Congress saw at the time it passed the statute

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

did the Government make that argument, in Williams?

23
24
25

Did you make that argument,

MS. MAYNARD:

Did we make the argument in

Williams?
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, that -- that Congress

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

had enacted another statute which presumes that there is

2

no cause of action under 1346?

3

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, the Government conceded

4

in Williams that 7426 was not available to Ms. Williams

5

there because she had only been subjected to a lien, not

6

a levy.

7

in that case as exclusive of the 1346 remedy were the

8

quiet title action and a discretionary -

9

So the remedies the Government was pointing to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but even if it wasn't

10

available to her, the fact that there was another

11

statute the whole premise for which is the

12

unavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me

13

that would have, that would have strengthened the

14

Government's case in Williams.

15

MS. MAYNARD:

Well, we did point to the

16

statute, Your Honor, and suggest that the Congress had

made it available.

syntax of the statute in question.

Kreider was that the more general statute was phrased in
