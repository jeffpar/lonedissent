CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

this morning in 05-983, Winkelman versus Parma City

5

School District.

Mr. Andre.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. ANDRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case asks the Court to decide to what

11

extent non-lawyer parents of a child with a disability

12

may litigate an IDEA case pro se in Federal court.

13

Under two distinct theories, the answer to that question

14

should be without limitation.

15

today on petitioner's primary and first theory, which is

16

that parents are real parties in interest in IDEA suits

17

regardless of the claims being asserted.

18

But I would like to focus

Under 28 USC 1654, a party has a right as a

19

matter of Federal statutory law to litigate their own

20

case.

21

our position they are suing in their own right and are

22

suing on their own case.

23

because the right to sue provision that Congress enacted

24

in IDEA uses the broad phrase "any party aggrieved" when

25

it allows judicial review of an adverse administrative

Accordingly, when a parent sues under IDEA, it is

This is particularly so

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hearing officer's decision.

2

is the underlying administrative complaint or the due

3

process complaint that frames both the claims that can

4

be brought eventually in court, and also identifies who

5

the parties are that can appear in court.

6

The parties agree that it

Those complaint provisions in IDEA, and

7

there are eight of them in all we cite in footnote seven

8

of our reply brief; all eight of those provisions refer

9

unambiguously to the parents' complaints.

Congress did

10

not describe this due process complaint that starts the

11

whole dispute process as the child's complaint, the

12

child's complaint by and through the parents, or the

13

parents' complaint on behalf of the child.

14

Accordingly, when a parent files that due

15

process complaint, they are the real party in interest,

16

and again, the provisions make no distinctions about the

17

kinds of claims that can be brought.

18

matter that when they get to Federal court that -- or

19

there shouldn't be any limitation on who is the real

20

party in interest in Federal court, or what claims may

21

be asserted.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It shouldn't

If we say that the parents

23

are the real party in interest and are entitled to sue

24

in their own right, is that the end of the case, or do

25

we reach the second -- a second question as to whether
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

or not they can represent the children?

2

MR. ANDRE:

I don't think you would need a

3

reach a second question, Justice Kennedy.

It's our

4

position that the remedies in an IDEA case are

5

co-extensive and that the rights are inseparable.

6

so, this case was pleaded in such a way as to have both

7

the parents and the child be before the court.

8

this court were to agree with us on our first and

9

primary theory, we don't believe it would be necessary

And

But if

10

to have the child listed as a plaintiff to a future

11

suit, and we imagine that on remand the child might be

12

dismissed from the suit.

13

not an indispensable party.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's our position that he's

What can the parents get

15

out of this case other than reimbursement for the

16

tuition they've paid to private schools and procedural

17

rights that are given them by the Act?

18

get out of this case other than those two things that do

19

not depend upon their status as representatives of the

20

child?

21

MR. ANDRE:

What can they

Well, clearly the relief

22

primarily sought by my clients -- in fact, if you look

23

just at the relief section of the complaint that my

24

clients filed, which is in joint appendix, page 19, the

25

only relief they actually seek is reimbursement.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

There's a number of ways -

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What other possible relief

3

could they seek other than giving them a procedural

4

right accorded by the Act?

5

could they seek that they would not be seeking as

6

guardians of the child?

7

MR. ANDRE:

What other possible relief

Of course, it's our position

8

that parents are never acting as guardians, at least in

9

the legal sense, or lay representatives of a child in a

10

court action.

11

able to assert any one of the -- a claim asserting

12

violation of any one of the many rights conferred in the

13

Act.

14

And so, therefore, a parent should be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It depends upon their being

15

a party aggrieved.

That is defined in Black's Law

16

Dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.

17

MR. ANDRE:

Correct.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now if the only remedies

19

the parents are entitled to in their own right are

20

reimbursement, which is at issue here, and procedural

21

guarantees, why would not their ability to sue or to

22

appear pro se be limited to those two categories?

23

win this case, but I'm talking about how broad is the

24

rule that you're urging us to adopt?

25

MR. ANDRE:

You'd

Well, in -- and this could be a
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

very easy case if the Court wants to look just at the

2

specific procedural violations that my clients assert

3

and also the reimbursement claim that they assert.

4

it's of course our position also that the full bundle of

5

rights can be asserted by parents.

6

best way to answer your question, Justice Scalia, is

7

that -- to direct you back to the definition of a free

8

appropriate public education itself, and that's in

9

1401(9) and (29) in the statute.

But

I think maybe the

That definition

10

provides that a free appropriate public education is one

11

that's provided at no cost to parents.

12

district provides a free and inappropriate public

13

education, then it's the parents' obligation -- or not

14

obligation -- they have the choice of whether to

15

supplement the inappropriate public education with

16

additional services, or to replace the public education

17

with one that provides an appropriate bundle of

18

services.

19

So if a school

So I guess my point is that even in a case

20

where the parents don't necessarily seeks reimbursement,

21

they still are intended beneficiaries of the right to a

22

free appropriate -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The child is.

The child is

24

entitled to an appropriate public education and the

25

parents are entitled to have it provided free.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

really the only interest they have on the table, it

2

seems to me, separate and apart from their status as

3

representatives or guardians of the child.

4

MR. ANDRE:

We also believe that the parents

5

have an interest in the education being appropriate

6

for -- in addition to the reason I just explained, that

7

they may have to supplement education, but parents are

8

also the co-architects of the individualized educational

9

program that is eventually -- that eventually defines

10

the bundle of services that it provides the child.

11

they're integral to the -

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Well, you say

13

they're the co-architects.

14

anything more than they are given the procedural right

15

to participate in the hearing?

16

MR. ANDRE:

I mean, are you saying

I think they're given -- I

17

haven't counted them -- but I think they're given 10, 12

18

of the 15 procedural rights outlined in the statute.

19

And this Court explained in Rowley, Congress placed

20

every bit as much emphasis on parental involvement in

21

the shaping of the individualized educational program -

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't there a bit

23

of -- there's a leap from saying they have these various

24

procedural rights and they're are a party aggrieved by

25

the decision rendered after the hearing, that's a
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

different question, isn't it?
MR. ANDRE:

Well, typically a parent would

3

file a due process complaint, challenging the bundle of

4

services offered by the school district, and alleging a

5

procedural violation.

6

case where a parent would, by the time they get to

7

Federal court, try to be a party aggrieved is something

8

that they didn't exhaust -- that would render the

9

exhaustion requirement.

10

And so I think it would be a rare

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They are an aggrieved

11

party for purposes of the administrative process.

12

question is whether that -- when that is done, whether

13

they also constitute an aggrieved party.

14

the -- one of the points made by the other side is that

15

there is an express provision for proceeding without

16

counsel at the administrative level, and there's no

17

provision for proceeding without counsel in court.

18
19
20

The

And one of

So doesn't that suggest that the right to
proceed pro se is limited to the administrative process?
MR. ANDRE:

No, not at all,

21

Justice Ginsburg.

Congress sensibly recognized that

22

because the process proceedings are run on a State by

23

State basis, certain unauthorized practice of law

24

statutes or other laws require prohibiting counsel in

25

administrative proceedings might come into play.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress had to make it express in section 1415(h)(1)

2

that any party may appear in the administrative

3

proceedings with or without counsel.

4

In contrast, in Federal court, there's

5

already 28 U.S.C. 1654, which has been on the books

6

since 1789 as part of the Judiciary Act.

7

allows any party to litigate their own case.

8

actually makes a lot of sense that Congress would have

9

included the express right to proceed pro se -

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That provision
So it

Which just begs the

11

question, doesn't it?

12

parents are a party to the case in Federal court.

13

MR. ANDRE:

I mean, you're assuming that the

Well, again, it is our position

14

that they are because they're parties aggrieved by the

15

administrative proceedings, so long as they have

16

exhausted their claims.

17

other provisions, for example, the attorneys' fees

18

provision of the statute refers repeatedly to parents as

19

a possible prevailing party.

20

And that this is confirmed in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought it was the

21

unanimous view of the circuits that parents, as a

22

general matter, do not have the right to represent their

23

children in Federal court, that the provision of the

24

judicial code that you cited does not confer on parents,

25

generally, the right to represent children.
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ANDRE:

That's correct, Mr. Chief

2

Justice.

But our primary theory in this case is not

3

that parents are seeking to represent their children as

4

lay advocates in court.

5

parent suing under the statute is suing in their own

6

right.

7

with -- as -- with themselves on the caption, and

8

asserted claims that are their own, because they

9

believed that those claims are their own, and they

Our primary theory is that a

In fact, that's why my clients pleaded this case

10

believed they should be able to litigate those claims

11

under section 1654.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, it's not an

13

insignificant matter at issue here.

14

referred to as officers of the court, protect the court

15

from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no

16

basis.

17

and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a

18

lot more work for Federal district judges.

19

we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual

20

result?

21

Counsel, who are

When we give that authority to appear in court

MR. ANDRE:

Why should

Well, I'm not sure that the

22

policy considerations would be relevant to the statutory

23

construction question of whose rights are being asserted

24

in a case like this.

25

theory, the public policy considerations would be

But certainly under our second

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

appropriate.

2

It is our position that those public policy

3

concerns about pro se litigants burdening the court,

4

burdening opposing counsel are dramatically outweighed

5

by the fact that -- by the reality that two-thirds of

6

the disabled children in the United States come from

7

families that cannot afford counsel -

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The statute already

allows the shifting of fees to a prevailing party.

So

10

presumably attorneys can be found to take the

11

meritorious cases.

12

with are cases that can't attract attorneys, even though

13

the attorneys know that if they win, they will get their

14

fees.

15

And What we are probably dealing

MR. ANDRE:

Two responses Mr. Chief Justice.

16

First, in other regimes, where you have a fee-shifting

17

statute, the cases are usually still brought by pro se

18

litigants.

19

child, really, it is an all or nothing proposition.

20

Either bring the case and you have the potential to

21

recover attorneys' fees, or the case doesn't get brought

22

at all.

23

in our position and the amicus briefs from the Council

24

of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, and the Autism

25

Society of America.

Here because you are dealing with a minor

And this is borne out by the statistics cited

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Was their an argument at

any point in this case that the claim was frivolous?

3

MR. ANDRE:

No, there was not.

And then

4

that brings me to my last point, which is, as a

5

practical matter, there is a very limited private

6

special ed bar and they cherry-pick only the best cases.

7

But that doesn't mean that all the cases that are left

8

are frivolous or meritless.

9

cases out there, some of which may be quite strong, some

10

of which may be on the borderline, and some which may be

11

meritless.

12

There's a whole universe of

But Congress cannot have intended to create

13

this important and robust substantive statutory

14

guarantee to a free and appropriate public education,

15

and guarantee all these procedural safeguards, including

16

judicial review to enforce it, and then expect that that

17

right would never be fulfilled because -

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if they had

19

that overriding intent, it would have been easy enough

20

for them to make clear that this was an exception to the

21

normal rule, that parents don't have the right to

22

represent children in court.

23

to the administrative proceeding, as Justice Ginsburg

24

pointed out.

25

with respect to the proceeding in court.

They did that with respect

They perhaps conspicuously did not do it

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ANDRE:

Well, actually, if I could

2

clarify one thing.

3

1415(h)(1), it does not provide that a parent can

4

represent their child in the administrative proceeding.

5

It just says that any party may litigate that

6

administrative proceeding.

7

If you look closely at section

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know, but 14 -- is

8

it 1415(f)?

Specifically says that parents have the

9

right to participate in the due process hearing.

I'm

10

looking at 1415(f)(1)(A).

11

the right to participate in the due process hearing.

12

MR. ANDRE:

In other words, parents have

But that's also -- our position

13

is they have the right to participate in the due process

14

hearing as parties, in fact as the kind of plaintiff

15

side parties.

16

that we cite in footnote seven of our reply brief that

17

talk about the parents' complaint.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And that is confirmed by the provisions

It doesn't say they

19

have the right to participate as parties.

20

it says they have the right to -- for an impartial due

21

process hearing.

22

figure out who is the party to that case, you would

23

still think of it in terms of the child and not the

24

parents.

25

They have -

I would suppose if you're trying to

MR. ANDRE:

Well, we thought that -- we
15

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

believe that Congress thought of it as the parents

2

because of all the statutory references to the parents'

3

complaint.

4

that the child could not also be a party to those

5

proceedings.

6

Of course, we don't take the absurd position

But in any event, my point was simply that

7

the express Lesesne argument that some courts relied on

8

to suggest that Congress consciously decided not to

9

allow parental lay representation, I mean, that argument

10

simply doesn't have a strong foundation, because the

11

provision on which that argument is based, which is

12

1415(h)(1), is ambiguous at best.

13

suggest just the opposite.

14
15
16

And, in fact, could

I'd like to address a point that Respondents
have relied on JUSTICE ALITO:

Before you do that, how much

17

of a practical benefit would it be for children with

18

disabilities and their parents, if you are successful

19

here, in light of the complexity of the IDEA and the

20

fact that this is an area where some parents are going

21

to have difficulty maintaining any kind of emotional

22

detachment from the litigation?

23

If parents can represent their -- can -- a

24

non-lawyer parent can appear in court, isn't there a

25

risk that in some instances where a lawyer could be
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

found if the parent made an effort to do that, they're

2

going to be lured into trying to provide the

3

representation themselves?

4

MR. ANDRE:

Well, first of all, parents

5

already have to get to know the statute and the

6

applicable regulations when they bring these cases at

7

the administrative level.

8

court, they are intimately familiar with the facts and

9

intimately familiar with the relevant law.

By the time they get to

The only

10

thing that's different about the court action and the

11

administrative proceeding is now you have the Federal

12

Rules of Civil Procedure.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

These disadvantaged parents

14

that you are referring to who comprise the majority of

15

parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1)

16

and all that stuff?

17

mean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are

18

the people least likely to have familiarized themselves

19

with the statute and the procedures.

20

I find that hard to believe.

MR. ANDRE:

I

I'm not sure we agree, with all

21

due respect, Justice Scalia.

But even if that's true,

22

the nature of IDEA court action, I think, addresses some

23

of the concern.

24

proceedings, like in merit systems protection board

25

cases, or immigration cases.

These are not pure record review

MR. SALMONS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Congress made parents of children with

administrative and judicial proceedings under the IDEA,

25

and granted parents their own rights under the Act.

Alderson Reporting Company

One

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the rights granted expressly to parents is the right

2

to seek reimbursement for private educational expenses

3

when the parents believe the school has failed to

4

provide an appropriate education.

5

That is the claim that's at issue in this

6

case, and the parents are clearly the appropriate party

7

for that claim because they're the ones that have

8

incurred the financial harm.

--

10

When they are reimbursed

That argument proves

11

a little too much.

12

victim of a tort, for example, and suffers a serious

13

injury, it is the parents who are going to have to bear

14

the costs of accommodating that injury.

15

tort action, it's still the child who is the party and

16

not the parent.

17

If you have a child who is the

MR. SALMONS:

And yet in any

Well, I think that's right,

18

Your Honor, but the difference here is that the statute

20

Petitioner's brief, expressly provides a right to

21

parents to seek reimbursement for the -- for their -

the educational expenses that they incur.

23

And while the parents have to show that

there was a denial of a free appropriate public

education, we think it's clear that the statute makes

example, out of the Fourth District, in Emery, that

would suggest that it is not even clear that the child

who have no alternative, they have to take what the

school district gives them because they don't have the

wherewithal to enroll their child in a private school.

MR. SALMONS:

It's the people who can't -

Well, that's not the sum total

of our argument, Your Honor.

that actually there's a relatively narrow way to decide

21

this case if the Court so chose, by focusing on the

22

reimbursement claim in this case.

23

I was just pointing out

Our position is that parents share in the

24

substantive right to a free appropriate public education

25

under the Act.

And there are two things we would point
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

to in regard to the definition of a free appropriate

2

public education that we think makes this clear.

3

this is in section 1401 of the Act on pages 2A and 4A of

4

Petitioner's brief.

5

And

The first is the definition says that the

6

term free appropriate public education means special

7

education services provided, quote, without charge and

8

at no cost to parents.

aspect, again, is first and foremost a right of the

We think clearly the free

10

parents, because they're the ones that bear the cost.

11

With regard to -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
Where is this provision?

14
15
16

I'm not following you.

1401 what?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think you quoted from

4(a).
MR. SALMONS:

There's -- That's correct.

17

The definition begins on page 2(a) "which says free

18

appropriate public education on section 1401 and it

19

says, "the term free appropriate public education means

20

special education related services that -- and under

21

subparagraph A have been provided at public expense

22

under public supervision and direction and without

23

charge -- Then in subparagraph 29 on page 4(a)the term

24

special education is defined which is again the term

25

from the definition of free appropriate public
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

education, is defined to mean "specially designed

2

instructions at no cost to parents."

3

And so again the right to a free appropriate

4

public education is defined expressly in part as terms

5

of the parents interest.

6

any question about what is the appropriate, if you look

7

back again on 2(a), subparagraph D of the definition of

8

free appropriate public education, it says that it has

9

to be special education services that are provided in

We also think that regards to

10

conformity with the individual education program

11

required under the Act.

12

And now the individual education program or

13

IEP process is the process by which parents are given

14

the right to participate as full members of the IEP team

15

and to have a say in helping to define what is an

16

appropriate education for the child.

17

pointed out in Rowley, this is the essential feature of

18

this Act.

19

specify or flesh out a substantive standard for what is

20

appropriate for a child' instead it ensured -- it

21

mandated, excuse me -- that an appropriate education is

And as this Court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So their, their

rights -- so their right to proceed in Federal court

should be limited to the rights that you've identified

under the statute as opposed to the right to proceed on

MR. SALMONS:

That's correct.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other words, you

13

think -- you think their -- their, their rights -- the

14

rights they can assert are only ones they can identify

15

as their own as opposed to the child's?

16

MR. SALMONS:

Well it, that is essentially

our position although I would add that our position is

18

that all of the rights of the statute are rights that

19

are shared by the parent.

haven't said anything.

I thought you were saying that

23

24

procedures.

25

they're still not satisfied with the public education

But if all the procedures are given and

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that is given, they would not be able to sue claiming

2

that it was inadequate under the terms of the Act.

3

You think they can sue then, too, as well.

4

MR. SALMONS:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, you haven't said

anything then.

7

MR. SALMONS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

We do -

Well You really haven't limited

the scope of the parent's right to sue at all.

10

MR. SALMONS:

Well -- well -- just because I

11

haven't limited the rights of the parents right doesn't

12

mean that I haven't been trying to make a point about

13

how to interpret the statute.

14

not limit the parents' rights to sue on behalf of their

15

child and on behalf of their own rights under the

16

statute.

17

The statute we think does

We think the way to think about this -

18

again, keep in mind that the right to initiate a due

19

process hearing and the right to seek review of that in

20

court, those are rights that are contained in Section

21

1415, which is the procedural protection, the procedural

22

guarantees of the Act.

23

that belong to the parents.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

And we think those are rights

Fine.

You've given the

procedure but where does the Act guarantee the parents

Official - Subject to Final Review

the proper outcome?

The proper -- assignment?

2

MR. SALMONS:

Well, we think the way -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It does give the parents

4

the right procedures explicitly and the rights to

5

reimbursement for -- for private tuition.

6

MR. SALMONS:

The -- that -- that's correct.

7

The way we look at the question, Your Honor, is to say

8

it gives the parents those rights, it gives the parents

9

the right to be full members of the IEP team that

10

determines the appropriate education for that child.

11

While the school district has the final say as far as

12

the contents of the IEP, the parents as members of that

13

team have the right to initiate litigation through

14

administrative procedures and then ultimately in court,

15

if their view of what is appropriate for their child is

16

rejected by the -- by the -- by the IEP team.

17

while, and no doubt -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

And that right, where -

19

where is that right contained?

You have given us

20

citations for the other ones.

MR. SALMONS:

2

education given to my child in the public school was

4

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, what I would refer

5

you to are the many provisions of the Act, and you can

6

turn to pages 16 A and 17 A for example of Petitioner's

7

brief that has these, in part, where the Act repeatedly

8

refers to the parents' due process complaint, the

But do they have the

They have a right Do they have a right in and

19

of themselves -- not as guardians -- do they have the

20

right to a particular outcome in the hearing?

21

that's the point I'm inquiring to.

22

MR. SALMONS:

That's,

Our way of looking at the

23

statute, Your Honor, says that if they are the ones that

24

initiate the hearing, they file the complaint, they are

25

parties to that hearing, then when, when their claims
26
Alderson Reporting Company

are denied, they are parties aggrieved within the

2

meaning of the statute.

3

aggrieved, that refers to the right to an appeal in the

It's the same term, parties

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PIERRE H. BERGERON,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

9

MR. BERGERON:

Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
The common law rule banning parental pro se

10

representation is as longstanding as it is pervasive.

11

Appreciating the fact that the IDEA does not abrogate

12

the common law rule, Petitioners instead seek to

13

circumvent that through this substantive rights theory.

14

If a due process complaint never raised any issue of

15

parental substantive rights, nor even did their cert

16

petition, which at page 11 said children had substantive

17

rights but parents have procedural rights.

18

Now, however, they tell this Court that the

19

right -- the parents' substantive right is so ingrained

20

in the fabric of the statute that the courts should

21

recognize it.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

How do you classify right

to reimbursement?
MR. BERGERON:

Your Honor, I would classify

that as not a right, it's a remedy.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

It is a remedy

premised on the denial of the FAPE to the child.

2

a result, it is simply a derivative claim for the

3

parents to recover those funds.

4
5
6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And as

The right to recover

money, it's just a remedy, it's not a right?
MR. BERGERON:

That's, and that's how 1412

7

is structured, the provisions about reimbursement.

It

8

depends upon the predicate finding that the child was

9

denied a FAPE and therefore one of the remedies, among

10

other remedies, compensatory education and so forth, is

11

reimbursement.

12
13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the provision

that says at no cost to the parent?
MR. BERGERON:

Your Honor, certainly that

15

has been one of the emphases by Petitioners, but the

16

response to that is that the free aspect of the free

17

appropriate public education does not give parents a

18

substantive right to the education itself.

In an instance in which the

MR. BERGERON:

Your Honor, I think it is no

4

different than a basic attorney fee award.

5

there's not a claim that -- that, you know, if someone

else, if the uncle pays the attorneys' fees that didn't

negate the award of fees on behalf of the child.

JUSTICE SOUTER:
negating the award.

There's not,

No, I'm not talking about

I'm -- if that theory is sound, if

10

the child is the proper recipient of the reimbursement,

11

I presume that ultimately the reimbursement is supposed

12

to go to the person who paid the money?

13

MR. BERGERON:

That's right.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Which would be the parent.

15

My question is how does the child in that case get the

16

money to the parent?

17

MR. BERGERON:

Well, because the claim would

18

have to be brought on behalf of the child, because they

19

would not have the capacity to bring the claim itself,

20

the award would go straight to the, to the guardian, who

21

may be the parent that is proceeding on their behalf.

Just So I'm looking at the

the confusing aspects about what the nature of the

substantive right is, and I think we've heard some

different versions of that this morning, is what is the

scope.

to retreat a little bit and make the rights more

palatable.

what is the right different than the child's right?

And

10

we simply do not have the answer to that, and for the

school districts applying this act on a daily basis, and

for courts interpreting it, it simply poses numerous

13

problems trying to apply to a parent a statute that was

14

designed to benefit children.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Your argument, I guess, is

16

this argument.

Now you're conceding the parent does

have a right to go to court, but he can only complain

18

about something that hurts him.

against the parent and if he doesn't decide against the

parent, obviously the parent can't go into court because

he doesn't have anything to complain about, the parent.

Isn't that your point?

MR. BERGERON:

Well, he can't decide against

3

the parent because the only issue at stake is the right

4

of the child.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:
Then you go ahead.

Oh, well -- right.

I'm

6

sorry.

I thought I heard you say

7

that the problem is that the parent didn't have a right

8

taken away by the hearing officer, and that's why the

9

parent can't go to court.

10

MR. BERGERON:

Well, he won't have a right

11

taken away from him because it's not -- it's not his

12

claim at stake in the due process hearing.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, I would agree, we can

be on the same grounds there.

15

MR. BERGERON:

Right.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I agree that if the parent

17

isn't hurt, if the parent wasn't deprived of anything,

18

the parents can go to court but doesn't have anything to

19

complain about, you know, whereas another section of the

20

statute says that reimbursement is something supposed to

21

be reimbursement for the parent, so it would seem as if

The parent
Now

We simply feel that

10

because the reimbursement, as I said before, hinges on

11

the deprivation of the right to the child and not the

12

deprivation of the substantive right to the parent, it

13

is the child's claim to bring.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I appreciate -

Mr. Bergeron, I have a

15

basic conceptual problem, both with that response and

16

with your larger argument.

17

classify the reimbursement right or classify

18

reimbursement, you make a broad distinction between the

19

substantive right of the child to the free appropriate

20

public education and on the other hand, the procedural

21

rights of the parent in going through the process that

22

ultimately comes to a conclusion for the child's

23

benefit.

Leaving aside how we should

24

The conceptual problem I have is that I

25

don't understand why it makes sense to say that the
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

parents have procedural rights unless that procedural -

2

or unless those procedural rights of the parents are in

3

aid of some substantive entitlement for the parents.

4

give procedural protection to people in order to

5

vindicate some substantive interest that they can claim,

6

and you're, in effect, splitting those two apart.

7

You're saying one person has a substantive right, the

8

other people have procedural right.

9

conceptually how you can make that split.

We

And I don't see
And if you

10

don't make that split, then it only makes sense that the

11

right to the free public -- the free appropriate public

12

education is, as the statute in one place seems to say,

13

a right of the family group, the parents and the child

14

together, rather than the right of the child alone.

15

So conceptually, how do you defend the

16

distinction that you make between substantive rights on

17

one person and procedural rights in another?

18
19

MR. BERGERON:

And here's how I would

explain it, Justice Souter.

20

The right, the substantive right is the

21

right to a FAPE to the child.

And because the child

22

does not have capacity, Congress implemented a pragmatic

23

system to allow the parents to protect those rights.

24

It's derivative for the parent to protect the child's

25

right 40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why don't we say that

2

they are the procedural rights of the child and the

3

parents are simply stepping into the child's shoes to

4

vindicate them?

5

MR. BERGERON:

That is exactly what 1415(m)

6

says, Your Honor.

That allows a transfer of rights.

7

And 1415(m) is at 11a and 12a of the red brief, and I

8

hope I've got the cite right this time.

9

for states to require, and Ohio does, to require the

1415(m) allows

10

transfer of all rights under subchapter 2 that a parent

11

would otherwise have, straight to the child.

basically -

reaches majority.

That's right.

MR. BERGERON:

The child is no longer a

And that's my -- that's part

of what I was trying to say.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

21

MR. BERGERON:

I'm sorry.
Oh.

You go ahead.

Well, what I'm trying to

22

say is because the child lacks capacity, they can't do

23

all these things on their own until they reach majority.

24

But once they do and the rights transfer, it illustrates

25

that it's not really the parents' rights, it is the
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

child's right that they are protecting.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if -- what stands in

3

the way of that analysis is the text, which says all

4

other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter

5

transfer to the child.

6

Not only doesn't that help you, it seems to

7

me it hurts you.

8

accorded to parents.

9

It acknowledges that there are rights

MR. BERGERON:

Right.

And those would be

10

the procedural safeguards that are delineated in the

11

Act.

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But then you were denying

them, as I understood the argument.

14

MR. BERGERON:

Well, let me clarify then.

I

15

wasn't denying the existence of the procedural

16

safeguard.

17

they are not redressible independent of themselves in

18

Federal court unless -- and this is what 1415(f)(3)(E)

19

clarifies, is that you have to have a substantive

20

violation.

21

the child is provided a FAPE, no one disputes that, but

22

a parent says well, you didn't invite me to a meeting,

23

what's your remedy there?

24

that's what Congress was trying to clarify.

25

To the contrary, what I'm saying is that

Because if you think of a situation in which

There is no remedy.

Isn't that the problem?

42
Alderson Reporting Company

On

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the analysis that you're coming up with, parents end up

2

without even the procedural rights, because you're

3

saying the only person who can basically invoke a

4

violation of procedural right is the person whose been

5

denied the substantive right.

The parent hasn't been

6

denied the substantive right.

Therefore, the parent

7

cannot invoke even the procedural right which ostensibly

8

on your own analysis, the parent has been given.

9

can't be correct.

10

MR. BERGERON:

That

Your Honor, if you look at -

11

I'll direct you to the DiBuo case and the Lesesne case,

12

I'm probably mispronouncing both of them -

JUSTICE SOUTER:
me to cases -

MR. BERGERON:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but before you direct

Okay.
What's wrong with the

analytical point that I just made?
MR. BERGERON:

Well, Your Honor, the -

19

that's what Congress was trying to clarify in 2004.

20

They did not want technical procedural violations to

21

eclipse the substantive rights, and so what they

22

provided was the substantive right is the only one that

23

is important.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but instead of saying

they're not eclipsed, you're saying they are totally
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

blocked out.

2

response to my earlier objection, that the procedural

3

right, in fact, can only ultimately be invoked for the

4

vindication of the substantive right.

5

substantive right is the child's, not the parents, it

6

would follow that the parents cannot even invoke their

7

procedural rights, and we know that that can't be

8

correct.

9

Because you analysis, I thought was, in

MR. BERGERON:

And because the

Right, and I'm not saying

10

that the parent -- the parent's procedural rights are

11

gone.

12

I mean, remember JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if the parent's

13

procedural rights are not gone, then the parents must be

14

able to invoke those procedural rights based on what

15

they claim to be a denial of some substantive

16

entitlement.

17

the child, but if the parents are going to have any

18

procedural right worth having, they've got to invoke it

19

for the purpose of vindicating that substantive right;

20

isn't that correct?

You're saying that's the entitlement of

MR. BERGERON:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

Then why do not the

6

cases make clear that notwithstanding procedural

7

violations, there must actually be a causation, there

8

must actually be substantive harm before any relief can

9

flow from that.

And if you look at the DiBuo case and the Lesesne

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Does a parent have a

11

right to bring a 1983 action if their procedural rights

12

under this statute are interfered with by the state

13

actors?

14

MR. BERGERON:

Your Honor, if the parent

15

would otherwise have a 1983 claim under 1415(l), if it

16

relates to an IDEA claim, there would have to be

17

exhaustion first.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think I understand

19

your argument based on 3(E), but when I look at 21a of

20

my blue brief there's another provision on attorneys'

21

fees and it's phrased in a very curious way.

22

that fees are allowed to a prevailing party who is the

23

parent of a child with a disability.

24

that's the most difficult express language for you to

25

deal with.

It says

It seems to me

It doesn't say attorneys' fees happen to be
45
Alderson Reporting Company

1

allowed to parents, it's to a prevailing party who is a

2

parent.

3

parent can never be a prevailing party.

And I understand your argument to be that a

4

MR. BERGERON:

That's right.

And let me try

5

to explain why.

If you look at 1411(e)(3)(E), which is

6

5a of the red brief, and I'm sorry to keep jumping

7

briefs on you, that provides that litigation brought to

8

secure the right of the child to a FAPE is brought on

9

behalf of the child.

So Congress added both that

10

section and the section you were just referring to at

11

the same time, and the only way to read them

12

harmoniously is that any action that is being brought on

13

behalf of the child to secure the FAPE, it's not the

14

parent's own action that they are bringing, they are

15

bringing it on their own -- on behalf of the child.

disability to ensure a free and appropriate public

2

education for such child.

3

What do you think that proves?

4

MR. BERGERON:

What I'm saying is Congress

5

recognized that when legal action is being brought to

6

secure FAPE, just like it's the child's right to the

7

FAPE under subchapter 2, it is being brought on behalf

8

of the child.

9

problem with the common rule law, because the common law

And that's where petitioners run into

10

rule that they don't dispute is that parents cannot

11

bring claims on behalf of the child pro se.

12

have to find a way to abrogate, and they initially

13

argued in the opening brief for an exception to the

14

common law rule, which from my reading of the reply

15

brief they have abandoned.

16

as far as the petitioners go is what is the nature of

the substantive right.

pointed to that says disbursements under subparagraph

(d), but your brief doesn't include subparagraph (d).

MR. BERGERON:

It's the high cost, one of

the high cost funds for states, Justice Ginsburg.

24

I'd like to make -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well then, if this

Alderson Reporting Company

provision is limited to subparagraph (d), how can you

2

argue that it covers the waterfront?

3

MR. BERGERON:

Well, Your Honor, I think

4

it's indicative of what Congress appreciated the claim

5

would look like on any level, and it's not simply saying

6

that those funds aren't provided under subparagraph (d).

7

That is the nature of the claim.

8

what section we are looking at, that is the nature of

9

the claim that could be brought in order to secure a

10

FAPE for the child, and in every circumstance, it is

11

brought on behalf of the child.

12

Regardless of under

Your Honor, I'd like to make one point, if I

13

can, about the spending clause, in response to

14

petitioner's argument in the reply brief.

15

Petitioners effectively say that the

16

spending clause doesn't apply because this is not an

17

issue of liability.

18

again to Rowley, where at footnotes 11 and 26 the Court

19

recognized the difference between the educational

20

benefit which is the FAPE, and maximizing the

21

educational outcome.

22

I'd like to direct your attention

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are attorneys' fees

23

allowed to a parent who is bringing one of these cases

24

on behalf of a child pro se?

It's a convoluted

So there's no issue under the spending

MR. BERGERON:

That's what -- I think there

6

have been four circuits who addressed that in the

7

context of attorney parents, and they've all said that

8

they cannot get fees.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So how is the

10

spending clause issue very significant in terms of the

11

exposure of the school boards?

Well, Arlington did not limit

it to simply liability.

and conditions.

have -- have to have a line item that there's going to

17

be X dollars in damage.

18

between an educational benefit and maximizing that

19

benefit that triggered spending cost concerns in Rowley.

20

Just like in South Dakota v Dole the issue of whether

21

someone was 21 in order to consume alcohol was not

22

necessarily a liability but it was a very important

23

obligation or condition imposed upon the State.

24
25

It said repeatedly obligations

And that's exactly what Rowley was
We don't necessarily

It was simply the difference

And their second point regarding the
spending clause is that not every single detail needs to

be fleshed out in clear notice.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So I take it your argument

3

is, your red brief argument is that Congress said,

4

states, if you get some judgments against you and they

5

award attorneys' fees, you pay for it, we won't?

6

that what it said?

7

MR. BERGERON:

No.
You don't pay for it, you

can't pay for it out of the grant?

claims against you under this because you didn't have a

good plan for the child and your attorneys' fees are

19

awarded against you, don't pay for it out of this grant.

20

Isn't that what you're saying it says?

21

MR. BERGERON:

Well, Your Honor, it's a

22

little bit different because part of the -- part of the

23

real issue here is not necessarily an award of

24

attorneys' fees to the other party, but it's the

25

incurrence of attorneys' fees defending 50

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought what your

2

argument was -- and if it's not, forget it, it's just

3

that I don't understand it.

4

says pay for this out of your own pocket, and then its

5

defines what you're supposed to pay out of our own

6

pocket is, as a parent representing a child, not his own

7

action.

8
9

That here the Government

And then later on they say, they define it
differently.

11

12

wouldn't make sense for the Government to say pay for

that out of the grant but not this out of the grant.

That's your argument?

MR. BERGERON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. BERGERON:

Because it

And -- I think that's right.

Congress hasn't provided any funds for this.

they, they recognized in 2004 they were only funding 19

20

percent of the obligations of the statute, and we have

21

to pick up the balance of the tab.

22

I mean

And their other argument on the spending

23

clause is that it's, you don't have to flesh out

24

everything in the statute but here we're talking about

25

two core issues.

One is abrogating the common rule law
51
Alderson Reporting Company

and the other is creation of substantive rights to an

2

entirely new class of beneficiaries.

3

If there's ever anything that demanded clear

4

notice, this is it.

It is much more serious and severe

5

than the expert fees at issue in Arlington, and school

6

districts and states simply have to have notice, what is

7

the parameter of the right that you are being requested

8

to recognize?

9

what we have heard in argument, it is simply not clear

to the school districts not only what the nature of the

right is but how to apply it.

Well, that's where I

13

have a little bit of trouble.

14

underlying right is still the same.

15

the child to a free and appropriate public education.

16

And that can be vindicated in court actions by attorneys

17

who get their fees paid if they prevail, and all we're

18

talking about is a situation where the parents can

19

assert that same right when an attorney won't.

20

It's not -- the
It's the right of

And I'm just wondering how significant

21

additional exposure we're talking about?

22

on that is whether to take the spending clause argument

23

seriously or not.

MR. BERGERON:

And what turns

Well -- and I think the

answer to that is it's still not clear to me from 52
Alderson Reporting Company

from listening to the argument today, I mean, Petitioner

2

acknowledged the child falls out of the equation.

3

This is a statute that needs to benefit the

4

child, and they're taking the child completely out.

5

so what is the nature of this parental right?

says well, it's all, it's all intertwined.

look at what Petitioner said -

What is the toll on the states, it seems

10

to me that if the state would have to pay for a lawyer,

if it lost, and that parents who brings the case is not

entitled to reimbursement, how is the state's pocketbook

13

affected?

14

MR. BERGERON:

Justice Ginsburg, in

litigating this case while the Winkelmans were pro se,

16

we expended far greater than the $8,000 at issue in

But you

19

would have had to do that if they had gotten a lawyer to

take the case.

21

is, the State agreed to undertake this liability, that

they would have to provide a free and appropriate

education, that if they litigated, they would have pay

implausible.

6

MR. BERGERON:

That seems a little

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

remember at the time the Congress reauthorized in 2004,

every circuit that had addressed it besides the First

had agreed that parents could not bring a pro se.

So

10

the states reasonably would not have believed,

11

especially in the circuits where it was decided, that

12

they would have to -- have to come up with these funds.

The rule is the same.

That's right.

Unless they're

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Bergeron, on, one of

14

the points you made on the spending clause argument, I

15

thought, was that if there are lawyers representing the

16

parents, the lawyers are going to screen out the more

17

frivolous cases.

18

are going to be brought.

19

intuitive appeal to that argument.

If they are not, more frivolous cases
And there's --

there's an

20

Do we have any -- any figures on the

21

comparative numbers of frivolous cases in lawyer

22

representation and pro se representation under the Act?

23

MR. BERGERON:

Justice Souter, we don't

Mr. Andre, you have three minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEAN-CLAUDE ANDRE,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

13

MR. ANDRE:

14

I would like to turn briefly to Respondents'

15

assertion that Petitioners somehow waived their claim to

16

reimbursement by not exhausting it below.

17

this in our reply brief, but if the Court wishes to look

18

at pages 78 and 88 of the joint appendix, particularly

19

page 78, there it is clear that the Petitioners were

20

seeking reimbursement in their own right.

21

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

We addressed

On the page 153, that Respondent refers to,

22

I assume that that point in time we were now on appeal

23

to the second tier of the Ohio administrative

24

proceeding, and perhaps at that point in time, Monarch

25

School was actually paying for Jake's education on a
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

grant-like basis, because that was something that

2

happened in this case.

3

in time Petitioners referenced reimbursement to Monarch

4

because Monarch had actually been expending the fund.

5

But by and large my clients expended the funds to

6

educate Jake at Monarch School, and they certainly did

7

exhaust that claim to reimbursement.

8
9

And that perhaps at that point

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you claiming that

hiring an attorney would be a cost, if the phrase "at no

10

cost to the parent," if they have to hire an attorney,

11

that the cost -

12

MR. ANDRE:

Certainly.

And I mean, I think

13

that's why Congress included the attorneys' fee

14

provision in 2004 that recognized that parents can be

15

prevailing parties.

16

that a free appropriate public education has not been

17

provided, then they can recover attorneys' fees as part

18

of their, their right to try to vindicate Congress's

19

purposes at no cost to them.

20

And if they prevail on establishing

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So why didn't

21

Congress just add the provision making this very clear

22

that the Senate had passed, why did the House boot it

23

out of the conference bill?

24
25

MR. ANDRE:

We don't know.

record is entirely silent.

The legislative

But one plausible inference
57

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

could be, could be reached based on looking at the

2

addition of attorney's fees provision and the timing of

3

the Maroni decision in the First Circuit.

4

down after the parental lay representation provision was

5

proposed by the Senate.

Maroni came

6

Maroni was the first court of appeals case

7

to recognize that parents may litigate these cases pro

8

se.

9

primary argument here today, which is that parents

The way Maroni did it however was by adopting our

10

possess the right to -- to sue in their own name, as pro

11

se litigants, not as lay representatives of their

12

children, and seek to enforce the full bundle of rights.

13

Congress very well could have looked at

14

Maroni and said aha, that's what we intended all along;

15

Maroni got it right, and then they just put -- Congress

16

just put the thumb on the scale a little bit by enacting

17

the attorneys fee provision which made it clear that

18

parents can be, or are the prevailing party if the

19

plaintiffs prevail in an IDEA action.

20

Finally, I would like to address two -- two

21

points about the spending clause.

22

the spending clause is totally inapplicable, but I want

23

to respond to Respondent's suggest that we're advocating

24

creation of a new substantive right here.

25

Of course we believe

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
58
Alderson Reporting Company

Why do you think

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's totally inapplicable?

2

MR. ANDRE:

We think that this Court's

3

spending clause jurisprudence is concerned with

4

providing clear notice to states with respect to

5

liability and certain fiscal obligations.

6

Respondent is complaining about here -

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. ANDRE:

9

And what

Please -

Oh, what Respondent is

complaining about here is essentially a disparate

10

impact.

11

impact claim under the spending clause.

12

And this Court has never recognize a disparate

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you think it is

13

not violated, not that it doesn't apply for some reason?

14

There is no doubt this is spending clause legislation,

15

right?

16

MR. ANDRE:

Well, absolutely spending clause

17

legislation.

18

concerns of the spending clause are not even implicated.

19

But that if the clear notice concerns were implicated,

20

the statute is -- clear.

21
22
23
24

But we believe that the clear notice

Thank you, Counsel.
