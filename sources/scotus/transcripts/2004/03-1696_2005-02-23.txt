ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY S. COLEMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. COLEMAN:

Good morning, Justice Stevens.

May it please the Court:

12

I will begin with that, if you would like.

13

This case is not moot because there is an

14

ongoing case or controversy between the parties.

15

a judgment, it is true, from the Delaware State court,

16

which has now been affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court.

17

But preclusion doctrines not Rooker-Feldman and not

18

mootness govern the resolution of the claims that we

19

asserted first -­

It is still in existence.

We've not yet

But I don't believe that mootness turns on

6

whether you have, in fact, collected on a judgment.

There

are very few cases out there in which a party has, in

fact, obtained two judgments, one from a State court and

9

one from a Federal court, usually because a party waived

give you the relief that you have -- that you are seeking,

MR. COLEMAN:

under preclusion doctrines.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If you win on preclusion, what do you do then?
MR. COLEMAN:

Well, hopefully we'll win on

22

preclusion with respect not only to this suit, the New

Jersey II suit, but also the New Jersey I suit, which we

say the district -- or the Delaware judgment precludes.

Ginsburg posed.

MR. COLEMAN:

We thought we would not seek

further monetary relief.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

1

MR. COLEMAN:

We have affirmative defenses to

2

the New Jersey I, but -- but the claims in New Jersey II

3

and Delaware are the same, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is your answer that you might

5

want equitable relief, an injunction to continue making

6

payments in the future, or something like that?

7
8

MR. COLEMAN:

No, Your Honor.

We're not seeking

additional monetary or equitable relief.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you would be stuck

10

anyway because you made a counterclaim and -- and it would

11

be -- on which you prevailed.

12

you would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything

13

that you could get.

14

And in that counterclaim

But -- but at this stage at least, the -- the

15

door -- there -- there is still conceivably an avenue of

16

further litigation because, SABIC hasn't yet said that

17

it's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to

18

petition for cert, for example.

19

MR. COLEMAN:

And, indeed, Your Honor.

I mean,

20

SABIC has represented to the Court that it likely intends

21

to seek certiorari relief from this Court in the Delaware

22

suit.

MR. COLEMAN:

Getting back to the Rooker-Feldman

5

issue, which is the issue on which the Court granted cert,

Rooker-Feldman is a narrow, limited doctrine, but it bars

7

only appellate review not parallel litigation in Federal

district courts.

vanishing original jurisdiction, nor is it a

Rooker-Feldman is not a theory of

10

jurisdictional substitute for the preclusion analysis

11

mandated by Congress in the Full Faith and Credit Act.

12

The expansive interpretation asserted by SABIC

13

misperceives the fundamental nature of appellate review.

14

It's untethered to any natural negative implication in 28

15

U.S.C. 1257.

16

of section 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act, in most

17

cases to which it is traditionally applied, and it serves

18

absolutely no useful purpose.

19

It illegitimately displaces the application

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the problem that bothers

20

me -- and I don't know that there's an answer to it -- is

21

you have plaintiff.

22

brings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit.

23

he decides he'd also like to go to Federal court.

24

brings exactly the same suit.

25

and exactly the same thing running along at the same time.

Plaintiff goes into State court.

He

And then
He

And here we have two suits

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Now, I know there are principles from this Court's case

2

law that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen.

3

They've always bothered me.

4

But now let's take a special instance.

The

5

special instance is that in court one in the State, the

6

plaintiff loses.

7

the Federal court, we want you to review what they did in

8

the State court.

9

Now, what he decides to do is to say to

Can't do that.

MR. COLEMAN:

10

Right?

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So he brilliantly

11

figures out I will omit the word review from my -- from my

12

motion.

13

use that word review.

14

their decision which happens to be -- in my opinion should

15

be -- 100 percent the opposite of what the State court did

16

showing they're wrong.

17

Now, you say because he cut the word review out, he can do

18

it.

19

I will ask for precisely the same thing just not

I will ask them to go and make

13

be precluded.

14

Then the second case -- the parallel case will
That's not Rooker-Feldman territory.

MR. COLEMAN:

That's -- that's -- Your Honor,

15

that's our position that -- concurrent jurisdiction is a

16

separate issue from the appellate review issue that

17

Rooker-Feldman raises.

18

Justice Breyer, the answer to your hypothetical

19

is that appellate review is something different from

20

having a parallel action.

21

best defined by two characteristics that I'll try to flesh

22

out for you.

23

Appellate review is probably

The first is that the proponent alleges some

24

sort of injury-causing error by the trial court and not by

25

the adversary and then seeks an order reversing, vacating,

Page 11

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

or otherwise nullifying that lower court order.

2

party alleges an injury by his adversary rather than the

3

trial court, the most that can really be said is that you

4

are continuing on a parallel litigation but not that you

5

are seeking appellate review.

6

like appellate review.

7

lower court.

8

nullifies or otherwise undoes the State court judgment.

9

When a

You do not have what looks

You're not alleging errors by the

You're not seeking an order that directly

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the argument -- it

10

seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when

11

you try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the

12

State case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in

13

some sense to review what happened in the State court.

14

Justice Ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the

15

answer.

Is that your answer?

16

MR. COLEMAN:

Absolutely.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Because if that -- if that is

18

-- if we accept that as the answer, then there's no

19

argument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to

20

include the de facto review as opposed to the -- the very

21

strict sense of review that you're talking about.

22

MR. COLEMAN:

That is absolutely our position,

23

Justice Souter, that preclusion addresses all of these

24

issues.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but can you -- can you

Page 12

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

expand on this a little?

2

I'm trying to clear up what's a confusion in my mind.

3

see how you could do this on the parallel business with -­

4

with delaying it on the docket and using the doctrine of

5

preclusion.

6

I'm not taking a view on it.
I

I understand that.

But we've still got this doctrine called Rooker­

7

Feldman out there, and as long as you have that doctrine,

8

it strikes me as odd if -- say, it weren't a plaintiff.

9

Say it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the

10

Federal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket.

11

Let's move it up.

12

the word review, but everything else is the same.

13

wants a decision out of that court that is going to be the

14

opposite of what the State court did.

15

concerning me -- maybe I shouldn't be concerned, but

16

what's concerning me is whether he can get it or not seems

17

to turn completely on whether he uses the word review in

18

the petition.

19

Let's decide it now.

MR. COLEMAN:

23

25

It should not and does not turn on the words
What it turns on is the

One reason why you don't need to be necessarily
concerned about this is that in all of these cases in

Page 13

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

which one case has gone to judgment and there is a -­

2

either a continuation or a new case, preclusion is going

3

to cover these.

4

The only extension of Rooker-Feldman that SABIC

5

is asking for is what they call the actually litigated

6

test. That is the heart of the Full Faith and Credit Act.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Rooker-Feldman, if I

8

understand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction

9

bar.

Is that --

10

MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. COLEMAN:

Yes.

It -­

And -­

-- it arises from a negative

13

implication taken from section 1257 and a second negative

14

implication from 1331.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, to -- so if the two

16

lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit -­

17

they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance

18

waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter

19

jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.

20

MR. COLEMAN:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

To apply Rooker-Feldman in

22

that context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction

23

at the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the

24

line.

25

MR. COLEMAN:

And -- and -- yes, Justice

hypothetical and Justice Breyer's.

3

-- if I understand it correctly, is that the Federal suit

4

starts after the State court is done.

5

have parallel actions at the same time.

6

Federal claims are parallel or even filed first, as in our

7

case, you can't say that the moment you file those that

judgment.

You're simply asking for relief from something

that your adversary did to you.

MR. COLEMAN:

Of course.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Is it your position that what

should have been done in this case, not in the

hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just

stayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware

case?

MR. COLEMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.
And then when the Delaware

case was over, then what should he have done?

MR. COLEMAN:

Well, we could either ultimately

7

dismiss it or the Federal district court could say, looks

8

like your Delaware case is over.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -- and he has given you

10

all the relief your entitled to.

11

and dismiss the case.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

SABIC brings a motion -­

Therefore, you go ahead

Yes, or SABIC brings a motion -­
And therefore, my next

question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.

15

MR. COLEMAN:

Because the question before the

16

Court today is a question of jurisdiction, not of

17

practical consequences other than the mootness question

18

that SABIC has raised.

19

that what we may -­

20

But practical consequences are

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, maybe we could vacate

21

the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong,

22

but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the

23

judgment.

25

MR. COLEMAN:

I think, as in Feldman, that's a

question that should be first addressed by the district

Certainly we hope that you will vacate or reverse

2

the Third Circuit's judgment and allow the district court

3

to address those issues.

4

Perhaps we dismiss it.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if you don't tell us what

5

issue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct

6

the suit to be dismissed.

7

MR. COLEMAN:

There -- there is a live -- in -­

8

in the terms of Article III, there are live claims that

9

remain pending before the district court.

10

And while it is

true -­

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And I take it that's because

12

you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first

13

action and you don't have the check.

Has this Court ever said

anything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from

preclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation

instead of you go into Federal court after the State court

MR. COLEMAN:

I don't think this Court has ever

with at least Feldman itself.

jurisdiction over the constitutional claims in Feldman

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We will allow the district court to address that in

And so we think that the actually litigated

13

revision of Rooker-Feldman is simply inconsistent with

14

Feldman itself, that it improperly displaces full faith

15

and credit that is not true to the negative implication

16

from section 1257 which has to be a very narrow

17

implication, indeed, because 1257 gives this Court

18

jurisdiction, and it's only appellate jurisdiction, to

19

suggest that another court doesn't have that appellate

20

jurisdiction must be -- must be narrowly limited to the

21

context, the type of lawsuits that this Court would seek,

22

which is not simply they did me wrong, please -- please

not.

For these reasons, we would ask the Court to
reverse.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

This case is moot.

There is nothing for Exxon

cert.

20

MR. CASTANIAS:

That's right, and that's -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then why is it moot?

22

Because something could happen.

We might get this case in

23

theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional

24

problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision,

25

and should that happen, there luckily for them they have

this other case going.

2

I take it, to say you're going to ask for cert.

3

what you're going to say, I don't see how the case is

4

over.

5

So as long as -- you're prepared,
If that's

It's up to you.
MR. CASTANIAS:

Okay.

Well, I'm -- I'm not

6

going to take the Hobson's choice, Your Honor, but I am

7

going to tell you, first of all, that SABIC is going to

8

apply for cert.

At least that's my current understanding.

9

And second of all, that shows why this case is

10

not justiciable at this point because if the most likely

11

event in the -- in the event of this Court's review of the

12

Delaware determination, is a reversal on a statute of

13

limitations problem.

14

brought as the, quote, insurance policy that the Third

15

Circuit identified, which was if the Delaware Supreme

16

Court or the Delaware Superior Court had kicked this suit

17

on the ground of the 3-year statute of limitations -- and

18

if you look at page 20a of the supplemental brief, the

19

corrected supplemental brief that we filed with the Court,

20

including the Delaware Supreme Court's opinion, you'll see

21

that they had a whale of a time getting over the plain

22

language of their own statute.

23

That's the reason this suit was

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If for -- somehow

24

you won on that, even though it sounds a little like a

State law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and

My response, Justice Breyer, is

10

twofold.

First of all, with regard to the mootness

12

there may be a justiciable issue for a Federal district

13

court.

14

hypotheticals and what may happen in the future.

Not now.

15

We've been talking about ifs and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Castanias, was there a

16

proper case in the district court when the complaint was

17

initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in

18

Delaware?

19
20

MR. CASTANIAS:

We've never disputed that,

Justice Ginsburg.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

All right.

So you can bring

22

two cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and

23

that's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action

24

pending.

25

MR. CASTANIAS:

Right.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Now, you are urging that

2

Rooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had

3

parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is

4

ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine.

5

would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to

6

me rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you

7

rush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo

8

that State court judgment, I don't like it?

13

preclusion doctrine may accomplish this in a certain

14

number of cases, but I think it's important -- and I think

15

I have to correct my colleague on the other side here with

16

regard to the state of the record.

17

of the New Jersey II trial court litigation, but it wasn't

because of the Colorado River application that we made.

25

one is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a

abstention or anything like that.

3

That's not Colorado River

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, I -- I think, Your Honor,

4

you will see that that is a component of Colorado River,

5

and that was part of the application that we made to the

6

district court in this case under Colorado River.

7

only answer -- the only reason that I'm bringing this up,

8

Justice Ginsburg, is that if you'll look in the appendix

9

to the petition for certiorari, you will see that SABIC,

10

my client, made an application for Colorado River

11

abstention, and the district court denied that.

Justice Breyer, I think this is

the point in the argument where I want to turn to the

definition of review as this Court has -- has put it forth

10

in cases like ASARCO.

11

dismisses in their reply brief as mere dictum.

12

think that this -- the discussion of Rooker-Feldman and

13

the ASARCO case can be dismissed as dictum in that it was

14

a specific response to a specific proposal by the United

15

States appearing as amicus to dismiss the case for lack of

16

standing and instead remit plaintiffs to pursuing a second

17

suit.

18

This is a case that Exxon Mobil
I don't

In that case, the Court wrote that to re­

adjudicate -- and I'm quoting here from the opinion, and I

20

don't have the particular page here -- to re-adjudicate

21

the very same issues that were determined in the State

22

court proceedings would be -- again quoting -- in essence,

23

an attempt to obtain direct review of the Arizona Supreme

24

Court's decision in the lower Federal courts.

25

In ASARCO, there was no reference to what the

version of Rooker-Feldman.

as the vehicle to decide this, the -- the definition of

O'Connor, the Third Circuit's view is broader than that

which appears to be adopted by the Ninth Circuit, as well

as the Seventh Circuit.

And I think this brings me back to the

there's something wrong here, and -- and Federal court

2

should determine the -- in fact, the -- the claim

answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by

The

You don't appeal

Out.

There's no such claim being made here.

The only

8

claim that's being made here or the only conceivable

9

claim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might

10

want to do some litigating in the Federal case after the

11

State case is over.

12

preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because

13

there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not

14

apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about

15

is simply claim preclusion doctrine.

16

add a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal

17

with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if

18

they try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice

19

Ginsburg says, you -- you plead claim preclusion.

Why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?

There's no claim here that claim

I'm certain, as certain can be, that that court would have

reached the same result if res judicata had been before

it.

And I'm -­

But the -- the fact is that Rooker-Feldman is

7

there and, again, as -- as with my response to Justice

Ginsburg earlier, your -- your question would effectively

rub out any need for even Rooker and Feldman themselves.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, no, because the -- it -­

it would not rule out the need to have some answer when

15

unfair about doing it here.

16

what you're really asking us to do, when you say don't

Well, you're asking us to

extend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken

it, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for

this.

The Third Circuit injected Rooker-Feldman into the

Is that not true?

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, that's true, Justice

Ginsburg, but it's true because of the briefing cycle.

answer to the asserted mootness here.

9

don't have to move to dismiss it as moot.

I mean, you -- you
All you have to

10

do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that

11

has resolved this question.

12

Do you know of any case in which the existence

13

of a prior judgment in another court has been held to

14

render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second

15

judgment moot?

16

on that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that

17

because the other side is always going to plead res

I mean, you'd think there would be a case

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, or the other side is going

to give up.

established by the fact that there is a prior judgment of

Well, Justice Scalia, in the -­

in the realm that we're talking about here, the Fourth

mootness conclusion.

two cases in which the Court either -- either dismissed or

remanded for consideration of mootness in light of another

10

yesterday looking at Wright and Miller on this issue, that

11

when complete relief has been accorded by another

tribunal, that is the classic case of mootness.

We've also cited in our brief -- and

is that you don't need it, that claim preclusion is -- is

the remedy for the party who wants to get out of it.

2

why does claim preclusion apply?

3

what you've said -- somehow convince us that this refusal

to apply the State statute of limitations properly

show that the State statute of limitations applied and

barred their claim.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure I understand the

statute of limitations, if -- if it applied to the State's

case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the

14

identical ground that everybody agrees that the State

statute governs?

there could be issue-preclusive grounds on such a ruling,

Then -- then they say, okay, it's not going to be

May I ask you?

It's perhaps

an unfair question.

13

confine our attention to cases of this Court rather than

the courts of appeals for our primary guidance, and most

of the Rooker-Feldman law is court of appeals law, as we

-- we both know.

21

The Chief Justice generally likes to

Well, I -- I would have to say

22

that Feldman, of the two of them, is probably stronger

support.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And that is the case in which

the court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.

MR. CASTANIAS:

That's right.

But at the same

2

time, the -- the Rooker case also dealt with relitigation

3

of the identical issues.

4

And if I could just sum up here, seeing that the

5

light is on here, the issue in this case is limited to

6

identical lawsuits, identical claims.

7

decision in this case, if it constitutes an extension of

8

Rooker-Feldman at all, is only a modest extension because

9

it recognizes, consistent with ASARCO, consistent with

The Third Circuit's

10

Heck, and consistent with the very notion, Justice Souter,

11

of de facto appeals, not actual appeals, but de facto

12

appeals being prohibited by the doctrine -- it recognizes

13

that claims actually litigated in a State suit to a

14

judgment, if they are litigated anew in the Federal court,

15

that is de facto appellate review.

The judgment of the Third Circuit should be

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

24
25

MR. COLEMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Castanias.

And I'll take just a few of them,

Your Honor.
I believe the concession that the Federal court
exercised original jurisdiction at the time our case was

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

filed is an important concession because I simply do not

2

see yet still any rationale for this idea of vanishing

3

original jurisdiction.

4

I also see the concession made in response to -­

5

to your question, Justice Breyer, about what happens if

6

they win on the statute of limitations issue.

7

of the cases they cite on page 12, footnote 5 of their

8

brief, the Northern Natural Gas case itself makes clear -­

and there are other cases.

Well, one

They went to Delaware to apply

10

the Delaware statute of limitations.

11

front of the Delaware Supreme Court that even if they had

12

won that, it wouldn't bar another lawsuit in a different

13

forum applying a different statute of limitations.

14

only way they could even hope to get the shorter statute

15

was in Delaware.

16

to our Federal claims, so that if somehow it went back on

17

that procedural ground, it would not bar a trial in

18

Federal court.

20

moot.

21

They conceded in

The

The Delaware statute would never apply

We don't think that that's likely to

We also cited to the Court the Male case.

It is

22

an old case, but it does make clear that when there is the

23

question of jurisdiction before the court and some other

24

court rules on the merits, that does not make the case

25

moot.

In fact, you really wouldn't have a need for claim

preclusion if that were the rule in -- in mootness,

2

because once the case is final over there, they'd all be

3

moot, and you wouldn't need to apply -­

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. COLEMAN:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that depends on who wins.

You're right.
I mean, if you lost in the

7

other suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot.

8

-- it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.

9

MR. COLEMAN:

10

I mean, it

I -- I think that's right.

I'd also like to address, just very briefly, the

11

ASARCO question.

The language that the Court used in

12

there we don't necessarily think was loose or

13

inappropriate, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason was the

14

Court cites at that point an amicus brief by the United

15

States and it cites a particular footnote.

16

footnote says is it's a recommendation that the mining

17

company in that case could file a Federal lawsuit seeking

18

a judgment that the invalidation of the statute was not

19

necessary.

20

that -- that looks more like a direct challenge to the

21

State court judgment.

22

that behind the Court's language there -- and of course,

23

it was really just addressing standing.

24

directly addressing Rooker-Feldman.

suggestion in that case was a suit challenging the State

adequately cover all of this, that it is not true -­
JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Coleman, I don't mean to

7

take your time, but in the ASARCO case, was the State

8

court judgment final at the time in dispute?

Your Honor, there's a question

10

about that.

11

there was a determination that the statute was invalidate
