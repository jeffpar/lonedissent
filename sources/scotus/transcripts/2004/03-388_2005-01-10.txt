ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

may it please the Court:

10
11
12

We'll hear argument in Bates

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

Pesticides are economic poisons designed to kill
living things.

Sometimes they do not work as designed.

For more than a century until the 1990's, courts

13

routinely permitted farmers to bring claims against

14

pesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by

15

pesticides.

16

Congress did not intend to displace those preexisting

17

State law remedies.

18

In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972,

The farmers here allege claims for defective

19

design, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of

20

warranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that

21

severely damaged their peanut crops.

22

with our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate

23

for three reasons why those claims survive preemption.

24
25

I'd like to start

The defective design and manufacturing claims
challenge the product's composition, not its label.

The

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general

2

legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the

3

failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or

4

in addition to FIFRA requirements.

5

Now, with respect to the first point, Dow

6

concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective

7

design and manufacturing claims generally are not

8

preempted.

9

this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers

10
11

That concession warrants a remand here, as

to develop their claims.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But couldn't you make every

12

failure to warn claim a defective design claim?

13

they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects

14

would not have been present if the product had been

15

designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse

16

effect on the peanut crop.

17

MR. FREDERICK:

That is,

Justice Ginsburg, the way the

18

Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1

19

and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that

20

products liability claims can proceed on:

21

design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings.

22

The restatement explains that they are distinct legal

23

theories that go to different problems that the

24

manufacturer has caused with respect to the product.

25

defective design claim asserts that the composition was

a defective

A

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

inadequate and that a properly designed product could have

2

been put on the market that would not cause the harm.

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Frederick, on the

4

defective design claim, presumably that's based on a

5

factual theory that Dow could have reasonably designed

6

Strongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acid

7

soil.

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Correct.
But doesn't that mean your

10

client should have to put forward some evidence

11

establishing a material issue of disputed fact on that

12

point?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Certainly, but here -And it didn't do that.

Well here, Your Honor, the

16

motion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not based

17

on the merits of the claims.

18

preempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law.

19

also asserted a limitation of -- of remedy provision.

20

It was based on them being
They

But we never had discovery in this case.

The

21

District Court, after finding jurisdiction, considered

22

Dow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked

23

us out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance

24

to prove that a safer design for the product could have

25

been made.

And that's where we think the court's decision

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

below was overbroad and should be reversed.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the problem I have with

3

-- with the Government's case and with the respondent's

4

case is that -- it's really the obverse of what Justice

5

Ginsburg said.

6

everything as a warning.

7

MR. FREDERICK:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Their problem is that they would recast

That's absolutely correct.
Does the restatement have some

specific provisions that say no matter how good the

10

warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's

11

a -- I don't know -- dangerous product or defective

12

product or something?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Restatement sections 1 and

14

2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if

15

you can show that the product could have been reformulated

16

to be properly designed, then the existence of a warning

17

that might go to certain of its uses would not negate a

18

defective design claim.

19
20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even -- even if the warning

specifically covered that design defect?

21
22

The Texas Supreme Court --

MR. FREDERICK:
correct.

23

That -- that's -- that's

And what the restatement -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24

warning:

25

not good enough?

So even if this product said,

may not be effective in high pH soils, that's

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FREDERICK:

Under the restatement rule,

2

which Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've

3

cited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true

4

because the restatement explains that there are certain

5

warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not

6

understood properly and that if it can be proved that a

7

properly designed product would be on the market, there

8

are public policy reasons why that's what we want to

9

encourage manufacturers to do.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, under --

At any cost?

I mean, what if

11

it -- you know, yes, I can -- I can sell you stuff that

12

will -- that will work in high pH soil, but it's going to

13

be three times as effective.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do I have to sell it?

Well, the -Can't I just sell it for those

16

people who don't need it for -- for high pH soil at a

17

third the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way,

18

don't use this in high pH soil?

19

can't do that.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

It's crazy to say you

Justice Scalia, to answer your

21

question in several ways, that's a jury determination to

22

-- to ascertain the reasonableness of the alternate design

23

that the manufacturer would be asked to -- to do or to

24

market a separate product that was separately designed for

25

high-acid soils.

Washington, DC 20005

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it's never a question of

the reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

I don't think it's a question of

4

warning in this sense, Justice Kennedy.

5

their theory, which is that a defective design claim

6

always collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a

7

defectively designed product that admittedly causes harm,

8

and all they have to do is change the label and say, if

9

used in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm,

10

If you take

because that would necessitate a change to the label --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, not necessarily.

It

12

wouldn't be always either way.

13

fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a

14

subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury

15

could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not

16

having designed the super-safe product or the

17

unreasonableness consists of not having had a different

18

label.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

I would think that if in

And that -- there are -- that's

20

why the restatement makes clear that there are distinctive

21

theories for defect --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

case you have the first.

24

MR. FREDERICK:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And you're arguing that in this

That's correct.
It seems implausible on -- you

1

know, --

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Well, we have both actually.
-- because all they'd have to

do is don't use it in pH soil.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

We have defective warning

6

too, and -- and if I can address that as well.

7

statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or

8

misleading statement in the label as to any particular.

9

Our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for

The

10

peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are

11

grown.

12

misbranding, and that is actionable as -- both as a

13

failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of

14

warranty.

That was false.

15

Under the statute, that is a

Now, the Medtronic majority made absolutely

16

clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in

17

fact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law

18

claim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the

19

existence of a State law remedy is not an additional

20

requirement.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So on -- on that aspect of the

22

case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation

23

of FIFRA.

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

We don't necessarily need to say

a violation of FIFRA is -- so long as the requirement is

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the same, although we can certainly --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's a -- that's a bit

3

different.

4

thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- that this was

5

a violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.

You were -- you were asserting a moment ago I

6

MR. FREDERICK:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -It seems to me that you then

8

have a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was the

9

theory of your complaint.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

The theory of our complaint

11

was a failure to warn both for negligence and as a

12

defective product.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But the reason for that, I take

14

it, is that FIFRA does not -- I mean, I think you agree

15

FIFRA does not provide an independent private right of

16

action.

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's correct.
So you've got to sue under

19

State law, but you would -- you would kind of have a slam

20

dunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said,

21

the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the --

22

the warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an

23

inadequate warning.

24

within the -- the -- in effect, the -- the Federal limit,

25

and it would also make clear that you had a State law

That would -- that would keep you

cause of action, not a Federal cause of action.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct, and because --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and that's in effect

4
5

what you're arguing.
MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

And -- and because of the

6

preliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly

7

should have the opportunity to amend our complaint.

8

are counterclaims that this is done at the motion for

9

declaratory judgment.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

There

In your view -- in your -- your

11

opinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA -- suppose

12

EPA does the following.

13

publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of

14

cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we

15

think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think

16

that State tort suits will interfere with our ability to

17

promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're

18

preempted.

19

EPA looks into this and they

Can the EPA do that on your theory?

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes, it can and the -- the

20

interesting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of

21

course EPA hasn't done that.

22

never tested for efficacy.

23

comment so that --

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

efficacy data requirements.

EPA has made very clear it
It never even gave notice and

Well, EPA has -- has waived
Right?

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FREDERICK:

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.
Now, is it your position that

3

a State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy

4

claims?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

They have to do it pursuant to

6

their powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale

7

or use or under 136v(c) which says that when a State

8

designates a particular locality requirement and a special

9

need, it can impose a label -- it can impose requirements

10
11

that the manufacturer has to comply with.
Now, the EPA importantly -- and this is in their

12

regulations at 163.152 -- has specifically said that

13

States have labeling authority.

14

labeling requirements.

15
16
17

The States can impose

Now, there's no reason why --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But you're not relying on

that in this cause of action.
MR. FREDERICK:

No, Justice -- no, Justice

18

O'Connor, except to the extent that if the State can

19

affirmatively do it through a positive regulation, their

20

theory has to be wrong that the -- that any incidental

21

effect that induces a change to label is preempted.

22

theory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuit

23

relied on.

24
25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

That

Well, does -- does FIFRA

require the manufacturer to say on the label what the item

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

can be used for?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, but I want to address -So how -- how does an express

4

warranty claim escape preemption --

5

MR. FREDERICK:

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

As the --- where -- where Dow just

7

says the federally mandated statement is included on my

8

label and it's true?

9

MR. FREDERICK:

A warranty claim, Justice

10

O'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case,

11

is not a requirement under State law because it's a

12

voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties.

13

The Court I think has made clear that what has to be

14

ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the

15

State law create a requirement.

16

warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements

17

in -- as to warranties.

18

other ways.

19

That's not true in the

It speaks to requirements in

So what Dow did here with its warranty was

20

completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that

21

warranty by putting on the market a product that was not

22

suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown

23

is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook.

24

Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State

25

law.

And that has been, I think, verified by seven

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Justices of this Court in the -- in the Cipollone case.

2

Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is

3

important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a

4

footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where

5

there are general legal duties that are not observed by

6

the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product

7

itself, those claims are not preempted.

8

Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market

9

a -- a product that was mislabeled and that they went out

10

and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses.

11

We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages.

12

Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific

13

ones.

14

136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try

15

to prove to a court that fraud was committed here.

And the existence of the preemption clause of

16

Now, if I could briefly address two points.

One

17

is that the inducement to change theory should be

18

rejected.

19

decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for

20

several reasons.

21

That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit

First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b)

22

which says requirements for labeling.

23

requirements that induce a change to the label.

24

that's how many of the courts have gone off track since

25

the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court.

It doesn't say
And

They

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have read FIFRA as saying just because the word

2

requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that

3

imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to

4

change the label is thereby preempted.

5

overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on

6

manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they

7

can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy

8

so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced

9

to change the label.

10

We think that's

Because EPA does not evaluate the specific

11

contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are

12

made on -- on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly

13

ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer

14

has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to

15

court and say we would have to change the label and

16

thereby 136v(b) preempts it.

17

Now, I'd also like to stress that the other

18

side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap.

19

question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not

20

evaluate efficacy on the front end.

21

history behind these provisions is that EPA understood

22

from the very beginning that common law claims would serve

23

an important incidental regulatory effect.

24
25

As your

And in fact, the

If we could review the history for a moment.
Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

had brought claims against manufacturers for design

2

defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law

3

claims that we have asserted in this case.

4

established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the

5

American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and

6

explained what the common law duties of pesticide

7

manufacturers were.

8

Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages

9

of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there

It was so well

Yet, notwithstanding that, when

10

is not one mention of any effort to displace those

11

preexisting common law claims.

12

And when EPA, in discharging its

13

responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by

14

the requirement that it re-register products that were

15

already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's

16

standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you

17

should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't

18

do this.

19

administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood

20

except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor

21

General changed the position of the Government, that these

22

kinds of incidental common law suits would have an

23

important regulatory effect.

Congress responded, but importantly in the

24

If we could just take the case of DDT.

25

years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages

1

until it became clear that the groundswell over the course

2

of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only

3

at the back end that the expert agency regulators

4

determined that in fact the product needed to be banned,

5

but that was only after a very long history in which

6

common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and

7

others who were harmed by that product.

8

Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA

9

expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater

10

products than had been done in the Carter administration

11

in 1979.

12

that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the

13

EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done

14

is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who

15

put on the market ineffective products.

Justice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b)

doesn't include common law claims at all.

about the existence of the parallel requirements is the

same.

I want to address the point of the discordance

4

between what State juries can decide and what State

5

regulators can decide because Dow and the Government have

6

featured that in their case.

7

Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said

8

there was no problem to be had with juries rendering

9

supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were

falsity.

The Federal standard here

Tell the truth.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what

Well, that's their strong point.

15

So what is the response to that?

16

get two juries in different parts of the country to decide

17

absolutely opposite things as to what the label should

18

say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're

19

in an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed

20

this statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries

21

in different places.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Because you can easily

First, the juries -- unlike a --

23

a declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy,

24

Justice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is

25

not saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. FREDERICK:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

And

I don't have to go into all the argument.

3

5

I'm speaking practically.

Sure.
You know the argument.

It's a

very familiar argument.
MR. FREDERICK:

Sure.

The answer is that --

7

that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of

8

disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very

9

clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b --

10

surround -- by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow

11

States to depart in significant respects from what was

12

nationally uniform.

13

States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose

14

extra requirements for special locations.

And the way it did so was to say

15

Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the

16

way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a

17

problem was identified with their product in the States of

18

Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it

19

petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label

20

a supplemental label.

21

is for distribution in those three States only and it

22

provided 10 important changes to the label that it

23

otherwise had as a nationally uniform label.

24

the system is supposed to work.

25

regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims

And that supplemental label says it

That's how

If the incidental

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that

2

can be done without an adverse effect to national

3

uniformity through the supplemental labeling process.

4

what Dow did here was it has its label and then it

5

attaches the supplemental label that addresses the

6

particular conditions that exist in the State.

7

And

And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly

8

appropriate and valid way to address the geographic,

9

environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the

10

different regions of the country that engage in

11

agriculture.

12

if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in

13

Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly

14

instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow

15

the appropriate Federal standard.

16
17
18

There's nothing that is uncertain about that

Now, I would like to turn -- sorry.

Did you --

no, go ahead.
I would like to turn briefly to the -- the

19

requirements aspect of the case because we do think that,

20

under our broadest theory, this is a different situation

21

than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important

22

statutory indications that are in the provision 136v.

23

Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that

24

is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from

25

Medtronic.

Where in Medtronic there was a provision that

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to

2

requirements and whether or not the States should be

3

displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a)

4

and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be

5

imposed.

6

is.

7

somewhat different way because the States have this

8

authority that they did not have under the Medical Device

9

Amendments.

10

They're in addition to what the Federal standard

That means that you have to look at requirements in a

There's a textual indicator under (b) also which

11

refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that

12

shall issue these requirements.

13

in Webster's means what has been already described -- is

14

in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate

15

regulations.

16

for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court

17

-- five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would

18

encompass common law claims.

I'd like to reserve the balance -JUSTICE BREYER:

you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute,

FIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress

2

specifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity,

3

preempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling

4

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why doesn't the other

6

amendment limit your argument?

7

passed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses

8

to get in to the business of -- of passing on efficacy, it

9

-- it need not do so.

Because Congress has also

And in fact we know it is not doing

10

so.

11

those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't

12

the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of -- of the

13

-- the whole preemption claim?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to

There are -- there are two

15

fundamental reasons.

16

requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains,

17

that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide

18

with the precise labeling to the word and font size that

19

EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the

20

wording relates to human safety, environmental protection,

21

or efficacy.

22

The first is that it is a principal

Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr.

23

Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA

24

to Congress -- and Congress' -- the -- the committee

25

report plainly indicates this -- that the EPA was not

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no

2

longer concerned with efficacy.

3

because the Department of Agriculture and the extension

4

services and the State universities are all involved in

5

this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory

6

requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for

7

registration, even submit a registration application, the

8

manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing,

9

which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive

10

11

didn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss.

design without impeaching the labeling.

Powers, the University of Texas Law School, for the -- the

21

Texas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law,

22

and he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why

23

they are all preempted and all invalid under independent

24

and adequate State grounds.

But what we did is we didn't move to dismiss.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

We filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion

2

for summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this

case to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, and

over again about how this was decided on the pleadings,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Under Texas law -- and the Court of

subjects.

allowed, and we -- we actually filed this in Lubbock,

Texas, which is the geographic center of where these 29

farmers operate.

Now, with respect to defective design, yes,

11

under Texas law if they had a -- they have to allege and

they have to prove that there is a safer alternative

design for this product, which they never even introduced

14

one quantum of evidence about.

you're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than

Therefore, preemption.

That is exactly right.

What they

could have done in response to our motion for summary

judgment is to say this product assertedly harms -- when

it is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the

product it is -- the plant that it's supposed to protect

what you have just said that there is no -- even though

4

the statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way

5

that that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is

6

something strictly for EPA to deal with, that the statute

7

has a prohibition on misbranding?

8

that all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says

9

no misbranding.

10

I can see the argument

So is EPA the only the player in the

misbranding --

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Insofar as labeling is concerned,

12

the answer is yes, and that's because the statute -- the

13

statute has many, many instances in which it makes it

14

clear that in service of the objective of a nationally

15

uniform label, the expert agency that approves and

16

dictates the language of that label be the one to decide

-- that is, a little bit different

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The problem that I think some

4

of -- several of us are having is that both the -- as I

5

understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument

6

draws no distinction between the two following kinds of

7

situations.

8

manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the

9

label, but the manufacturer didn't.

Situation A:

there's something that the

Situation B:

the

10

manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is

11

wrong and in Justice Stevens' example is in fact false and

12

it causes harm.

13

It makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption

14

purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the

15

ground that I bought it in reliance on the label, the

16

label was false, I should get damages for -- for whatever

17

harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for

18

preemption purposes differently from the situation in

19

which the -- the manufacturer made no false statement.

20

simply should have said more.

21

distinguish between those two situations, then the -- the

22

prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing
