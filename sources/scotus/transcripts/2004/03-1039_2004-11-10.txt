ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA N. CORTINA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MS. CORTINA:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

10

In this case, the Ninth Circuit violated AEDPA

11

by reversing the California Supreme Court's decision

12

affirming Payton's 1982 death sentence.

13

Supreme Court applied the exact right case, namely Boyde

14

v. California, in the very manner contemplated that -- by

15

that decision when assessing Payton's claim that his jury

16

misunderstood the court's instructions and, in particular,

17

factor (k) so as to unconstitutionally preclude

18

consideration of his mitigating evidence.

19

The California

The California Supreme Court's application of

20

Boyde is precisely the type of good faith application of

21

Federal constitutional law to which AEDPA demands

22

deference.

23

and this can be demonstrated in three aspects of the

24

decision.

25

It is manifestly not objectively unreasonable,

The first is that the California Supreme Court

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

recognized Boyde's specific holding that factor (k)

2

facially comported with the Eighth Amendment.

3

The second is -

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I thought the holding was

5

that factor (k), standing alone, does -- does not raise a

6

-- does -- does not, standing alone, raise a question of

7

reasonable probability of -- of misunderstanding or

8

misapplication of the law.

9

claiming here.

10

And that's not what they're

They're claiming here that there was something

11

much more than (k) standing alone.

12

they're claiming that the difference between this and

13

Boyde and why this is not a standalone kind of case is

14

that the prosecutor deliberately argued or argued law that

15

was in fact wrong and -- and continued to do so even after

16

the court interrupted the argument and that the court

17

never gave an instruction that corrected the erroneous

18

statements of law that the prosecutor had made.

19

-- that's why they're -- they're saying this is not a

20

Boyde situation.

21

MS. CORTINA:

As I understand it,

So that's

Your Honor, Boyde has two specific

22

components to its decision, which is, first, what factor

23

(k) means standing alone, and you need to resolve that

24

issue, which California did, in deciding the impact of the

25

prosecutor's misstatements concerning factor (k).

So

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that, first, you start from the premise, as the California

2

Supreme Court did, in following Boyde, that factor (k)

3

facially directed for consideration of Payton's mitigating

4

evidence.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, no, no.

The -- the

6

mitigating evidence that Boyde held could be considered

7

without a -- (k) being a bar, was mitigating evidence

8

about the -- the character of the individual prior to or

9

at least up to the moment of the crime.

So this is -

10

this is different kind of evidence, and I -- I mean, this

11

is post-crime evidence.

12

that Boyde's holding is so broad as obviously to cover

13

this at all.

14

question if it hadn't been for the prosecutor's argument

15

and the judge's failure to correct it.

16

without those elements, there would be a serious question

17

whether Boyde covered this at all.

18

And -- and I don't see that -

It might be a -- it would be a -- a closer

MS. CORTINA:

But even -- even

Your Honor, the -- respectfully I

19

disagree.

20

correctly and -- and reasonably determined that Boyde's

21

holding encompassed Payton's character mitigating --

22

Payton's mitigating character evidence because the holding

23

in Boyde -- or the issue directly presented by Boyde was

24

whether factor (k) limited consideration to circumstances

25

related to the crime or allowed for non-crime related

I believe that the California Supreme Court

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

mitigating evidence in deciding the appropriate penalty.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do we make of the Chief

3

Justice's clear statement, not once but twice, in Boyde?

4

The prosecutor never suggested that background and

5

character evidence could not be considered.

6

take Boyde with that qualification when we have a case

7

where the prosecutor, indeed, suggested that this

8

information could not be taken into consideration as a

9

mitigating factor?

10

MS. CORTINA:

So mustn't we

No, Justice Ginsburg.

First, you

11

must assess factor (k) facially and that's what Boyde did.

12

Then the next question is did the prosecutor's

13

misstatements concerning factor (k) mislead the jury to

14

believe that they could no longer consider Payton's

15

mitigating character evidence.

16

second component of Boyde which is a general test for

17

assessing the reasonable likelihood a jury misunderstood

18

the instructions in the context of the proceedings.

19

the particularly relevant and important inquiry in this

20

case is the California Supreme Court's application of

21

Boyde's reasonable likelihood test in the context of the

22

proceedings.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that would be the

And

Well, do we take -- do we take

24

the case on the assumption that the trial court erred in

25

not giving a curative instruction and in saying, well,

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

this is a matter for the attorneys to argue?

2

don't argue about what a statute means.

3

of law.

4

that it's mitigating or not mitigating or that it's

5

extenuating or not extenuating, which is I think how you

6

can interpret a lot of this.

7

that the trial judge does make a mistake when he says,

8

well, well, this is for the -- this is for them to argue

9

when the -- the point of the objection was that there was

You don't argue that.

But it -- it seems to me

a misinterpretation of the instruction.

11

point.
MS. CORTINA:

That's a question

You can argue the facts,

10

12

You -- you

That's a legal

And that is a fact that was

13

expressly considered by the California Supreme Court in

14

appropriately applying Boyde's general test for whether

15

the jury misunderstood the court's instructions and an

16

instruction that facially called for consideration -

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not that -- that the jury

18

misunderstood the judge's instruction, that there was no

19

instruction.

20

is the defense attorney says, I can use this to mitigate.

21

The prosecutor says this is not legitimate mitigating

22

evidence, and he said that several times.

23

said, well, you can both argue it, and the judge never

24

instructed the jury.

25

argue the law to the jury and for the jury to make that

I mean, the -- the picture that's given here

And the judge

He left it to the prosecutors to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

legal determination.

2

that is surely an error.

3

even so, it was harmless.

4

there be any doubt when the judge tells the attorneys, you

5

argue the law to the jury and let the jury decide what the

6

law is?

7

It -- it seems to me that that -

MS. CORTINA:

Now, you could still say, well,
But -- but I don't think -- can

Yes.

There -- there is a

8

reasonable likelihood that the jury did not take the

9

prosecutor's statements so as to preclude consideration of

10

Payton's mitigating evidence because the prosecutor's

11

statements cannot -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, even -- even if -- even

13

if that's argument is -- is on point, just taking your -

14

your response on its own terms, where do you get a

15

reasonable likelihood?

16

MS. CORTINA:

Because the prosecutor's

17

statements cannot be construed in a vacuum.

18

look, as Boyde required and as California did, at the

19

context of the entire proceedings.

20

what the jury was doing in Payton was deciding whether

21

Payton should live or die, the sentencing determination.

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You have to

What we're here -

Well, but let's get specific.

23

You -- you said there isn't a reasonable possibility.

24

Why?

25

reasonable possibility?

Get -- get down to facts.

Why isn't there a

1

MS. CORTINA:

Why there is not a reasonable

2

likelihood the jury misunderstood?

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

The prosecutor stands

4

there and twice says, before the judge interrupts him and

5

after the judge interrupts him -- says, you cannot legally

6

consider this evidence.

7

the judge never corrects it.

8

reasonable likelihood of -- of jury mistake?

9

MS. CORTINA:

It does not fall within (k), and
Why is there not a -- a

One, Your Honor, the judge

10

admonished the jury that the prosecutor's statements were

11

that of an advocate, and that -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

Precisely, if I recall -

13

and you correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought what the

14

judge said was that the prosecutor's statements were -

15

were not evidence.

16

issue isn't whether they were evidence.

17

statements of the law.

18

about whether they were correct or incorrect statements of

19

the law.

20

objection was totally beside the point.

21

Of course, they're not evidence.

The

They were

The judge didn't say anything

It seems to me that the judge's response to the

MS. CORTINA:

The -- nevertheless, the judge's

22

response relegated the prosecutor's statements as to his

23

personal opinion as to that of a -- some -- as -- as -- of

24

-- of -- to argument, which is a statement of an advocate.

25

And the jury, from the time it was empanelled, guilt phase,

and through the penalty phase, and at the concluding

instructions was repeatedly instructed that they would be

And the court didn't give them

an instruction on this contested point.

And

I respectfully disagree.
He didn't come out and say,

yes, you can consider this under (k).
MS. CORTINA:

He never said that.

No, but (k) says you can consider

it under (k).
JUSTICE SOUTER:

(k) says you can consider

13

evidence that -- that goes to the gravity of the crime.

14

will be candid to say I think you're stretching things

15

about as far as you can stretch, as Boyde held, that -

16

that character evidence pre and up to the time of the crime

17

can be considered reasonably under that factor.

18

certainly evidence of what an individual did after the

19

crime is committed does not naturally follow within (k) at

20

all, and I don't know why any juror would consider it

21

unless a judge came out and said flatly you can.

22

MS. CORTINA:

I

But

Your Honor, the California Supreme

23

Court reasonably applied Boyde's holding, that factor (k)

24

did call for consideration of character evidence, and

25

that's precisely what Payton presented -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what if we conclude

that there was an error here?

argument that you fall back on?

4

MS. CORTINA:

Is there a harmless error

Yes, Your Honor, there is a

5

harmless error, but before we even get to harmless error,

6

the fact that you disagree with the ultimate conclusion of

7

the California Supreme Court under AEDPA is not

sufficient.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The California Supreme Court's

May I ask a question that goes

13

sort of to the beginning?

whether or not the prosecutor correctly stated the law?

MS. CORTINA:

What is your position on

The State concedes, and as the

16

California Supreme Court recognized, the prosecutor

17

misstated the law, but the jury would not -

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you also concede he did so

19

deliberately?

20

misconduct is what I'm really asking.

21

Do you concede there was prosecutorial

MS. CORTINA:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

The

22

prosecutor did not commit misconduct.

23

a mistake, and the misconduct analysis, which is similar

24

to what Boyde contemplated when they set forth the general

25

standard for assessing whether a jury would misunderstood

The prosecutor made

1

-- misunderstand an instruction is -- is almost the same

2

when -- when you're analyzing whether the question is

3

prosecutorial misconduct.

4

how to assess a misstatement by the prosecutor, and Boyde

5

said that at the first instance, a statement of the

6

prosecutor is not to be considered as having the same

7

force as instructions from the court.

8

was recognized by the California Supreme Court and

9

reinforced -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Boyde sets forth the test for

And that principle

That -- that statement went to

11

whether the jury was apt to accept it, not to the question

12

of whether the prosecutor acted improperly.

13

MS. CORTINA:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

The -- in

14

this case, the prosecutor made a mistake.

15

that there's any evidence to support the conclusion that

16

the prosecutor committed misconduct in this case,

17

particularly -

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't think

Well, I -- I can see that a -

19

a prosecutor could say, you know, this isn't factor (k)

20

evidence, as a way of saying that this evidence is of

21

little weight.

22

you have not heard any legal evidence of mitigation, and

23

-- and that -- that's the troublesome part.

24
25

He did say at -- at one -- at one time,

MS. CORTINA:

Your Honor, the -- the State

concedes that the -- the prosecutor did make

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

misstatements, but I think that the bulk -- as you pointed

2

out, the bulk of the prosecutor's argument went to the

3

weight to be attributed to Payton's mitigating evidence,

4

and actually most of the argument by the prosecutor

5

indicating that Payton's evidence didn't mitigate the

6

seriousness of his rape and murder is -- there were

7

similar arguments that were made by the prosecutor in Boyde

8

and which Boyde found were not objectionable.

9

But again, the important scrutiny is that the

10

California Supreme Court evaluated the prosecutor's

11

statements within the correct analytical framework matrix

12

established by Boyde.

13

principles, the -- the effect of argument of counsel.

14

They considered the instructions, and like Boyde, they

15

found that factor (k) facially directed the

16

consideration -

17

They considered all the correct

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose -- suppose I were to

18

take the view that it is a violation of clearly

19

established law for a court to allow a prosecutor

20

repeatedly to misstate the law, misinform the jury about

21

what the law is on a life or death question without

22

correcting that misstatement, without saying to the jury,

23

jury, it's not for the prosecutor to argue what the law

24

is.

25

that, then that meets any standard of violating clearly

I tell you what the law.

death question, it is the judge's obligation to say, jury,

6

You take your instruction from me and here's

Suppose that's my view of this case.

I don't --

7

Boyde and all these other cases -- it just strikes me that

8

that's clearly wrong.

9

MS. CORTINA:

What do I do with that?
Well, you can find that the court

10

was wrong and not like what you did -- what the court did,

11

but the inquiry is whether the jury misunderstood the

12

instructions as a result of the court's conduct.

13

requires an analysis of the context of the proceedings,

14

and that is precisely what the California Supreme Court

15

did.

16

And that

18

minutes ago about are you urging, yes, this is error, but

you look at the instruction itself, the other

instructions, and that's an inquiry the California Supreme

And that is, the jury was

1

presented with -- with a instruction that said, you shall

consider all the evidence unless otherwise instructed, and

3

nothing out of any of the factors (a) through (k) limited

4

the jury's consideration of Payton's mitigating evidence

5

or precluded -- pardon me -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Oh, are you taking the

7

position that as a matter of California procedure, the

8

jury was entitled to consider matters that -- matter that

9

was not within (a) through (k)?

10

MS. CORTINA:

I think that the instructions

11

encompass the jury considering something not specifically

12

in (a) through (k) for purposes of mitigating evidence

13

because the instructions say, you shall consider the

14

evidence presented, and that was Payton's evidence -

15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Have the California courts

said that?

17

MS. CORTINA:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That?
Have the California courts

19

said that (a) through (k) are -- is not intended to be

they said that pre-Payton?

22

MS. CORTINA:

Yes.

I don't think that that issue has

23

been presented and decided by the California Supreme Court

being argued to us -- correct me if I'm wrong -- on -- on

2

the theory that this was factor (k) evidence.

3

MS. CORTINA:

It is our position that it -- it

4

does fall within factor (k) evidence, but in deciding

5

whether the -- whether Payton's jury was

6

unconstitutionally precluded from considering the

7

evidence, you look to the -- all the instructions.

8

when you consider the direction to consider all -- that

9

you shall consider all the evidence and then the

concluding instruction -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But Ms. Cortina, the -- the

12

red brief -- maybe it's not accurate.

13

instruction was all the evidence received during any part

14

of the trial in this case, except as you may hereafter be

15

instructed, and then that followed what -- the factor (k)

16

discussion came after that.

17

possible that the jury would have thought except for the

18

following things?

19

missed?

20

They say the

So would it not have been

Or is there something more that I

MS. CORTINA:

No.

The written instruction

followed the arguments of counsels.

22

no, there was no instruction after that.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what -- and so

So if they misunderstood the

24

factor (k) instruction, they would have thought they could

25

not consider all the evidence.

evidence under factor (k), and the California Supreme

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, if they believed the

MS. CORTINA:

But there -- but as analyzed by

8

the California Supreme Court, it is not reasonably likely

9

that the jury would have accepted the prosecutor's first

few misstatements.

11

jury would have had to -

And as I was saying, to do so, the

But all -- all I'm directing

consider all the evidence, except that which may not be

admissible, as I now -- or may not be relevant as I shall

hereafter instruct you.

MS. CORTINA:

I think it's they could

However, nothing in the following

instruction says you shall not consider Payton's

not objectively unreasonable, including -- in concluding

that the -- that the jury would have accepted the

just sat through eight witnesses testifying to Payton's

recognized that they had heard this evidence and that it

Then they heard the arguments of counsel

And we know that the fact -- in fact, that the

23

jury did consider Payton's mitigating evidence by virtue

24

of the questions that the juries -- the jury asked the

court during deliberations.

The jury asked whether Payton

would be eligible for parole and whether any change in the

law could retroactively make him eligible for parole.

3

only get to a consideration of whether -- what the effect

4

is of saving Payton's life, under the California

5

sentencing scheme that was -- existed at that time, if you

6

believe that there's mitigation evidence to consider

7

because California, at the time of Payton's sentencing,

instructed the jury that if the aggravating circumstances

death.

MS. CORTINA:

I mean, we don't know how they

That might be one reasonable

conclusion, but the other reasonable conclusion JUSTICE SOUTER:

But I mean, that -- that is a

18

possible conclusion, and therefore, it doesn't follow from

19

the fact that they raised the question about life without

20

parole that they necessarily had found -- that they were

21

necessarily considering the mitigating evidence.

22

MS. CORTINA:

It's a reasonable inference to be

23

made from the questions asked, and that's what you're

24

looking at.

Isn't that all?
MS. CORTINA:

It's one reasonable inference, and

3

that's what's the important inquiry, is that the trial -

4

the California Supreme Court reasonably considered the

5

relevant, pertinent facts and all the applicable law in

6

reaching a decision that Payton's jury was not

7

unconstitutionally precluded from considering his

8

mitigating character evidence.

9

the California Supreme Court's decision demonstrates that

And I think that -- that

10

it applied Boyde to the letter faithfully and

11

methodically, and that it -- it considered all the

12

relevant facts and that its decision under these

13

circumstances is manifestly not objectively unreasonable.

14

And that is the requirement, and that is the inquiry that

15

we're here today to resolve.

16

The -- the Ninth Circuit failed to give the

17

appropriate deference to the California Supreme Court's

18

decision in deciding that the penalty should be --

19

Payton's penalty should be reversed.

20

Circuit instead conflated objectively unreasonable with a

21

determination that it personally felt that there was

22

constitutional error and doesn't respect the distinction

recognized in AEDPA between a incorrect decision -- or a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN R. GITS

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MR. GITS:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

it please the Court:
I'd like to start off, if I may, by addressing

16

some of the points that were brought up just earlier, and

17

I'd like to indicate to this Court that the California

18

Supreme Court has held that factors (a) through (k) are

19

the exclusive considerations that the jury must encompass

20

in deciding whether or not to impose death or life.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Has factor (k) been

supplemented with a CALJIC instruction since Payton?
MR. GITS:

It has.

In 1983, 2 years after

24

Payton's trial, it was supplemented to include all of the

25

mitigating evidence that this Court has indicated the jury

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is entitled to consider.

2

But what is important -

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Excuse me.

Do they still call

4

it factor (k) or do they just have a supplemental

5

instruction that follows factor (k)?

6

MR. GITS:

It's been a couple of years since

7

I've done a death penalty trial, but I think it's still

8

called factor (k).

9

that way.

10

It's just supplemented and changed

The second thing is that this Court has

11

indicated some concern over the jury question that was

12

raised first in -- in the State's reply argument.

13

need to put the Court, I think, in -- in proper context as

14

to what occurred in -- in that jury question.

21

-- the question that is now before the Court.

22

to suggest to this Court that it is not reasonable to

23

believe that during that 10-minute span of time the jury

24

considered the -- whether or not factor (k) applied.

25

5 minutes -- they went into the
5 minutes later they came out and

They didn't commence their deliberations

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what was the question?

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GITS:

The question -- there were really two

2

questions.

3

possibility Mr. Payton could be released on parole if we

4

give him life, and the second one is if the law is

5

amended, could that be construed to be retroactively

6

applicable to Mr. Payton.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

One -- and I'm paraphrasing -- is there any

Those were the two questions.
Those don't sound as if they

thought his conversion to Christianity made a difference.

9

MR. GITS:

I think, Your Honor, what the jury

10

articulated is what this Court has seen on many occasions,

11

the jury's concern about does life without possibility

12

mean life without.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. GITS:

Yes.

They never went beyond that at this

15

point in time.

16

that the short span that they had to write that question,

17

which I agree, given enough time, might permit an

18

inference that they did consider factor (k), isn't

19

applicable in this case.

20

So what I'm suggesting to this Court is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, an equal inference is

21

they just felt that it was entitled to no weight at all

22

given the horrific nature of this -- of this crime.

23

MR. GITS:

Yes, I agree.

And my position isn't

24

that -- that the short span of -- you know, assists our

25

position.

Our position is that this won't assist this

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court in arriving at a decision about whether the jury

2

considered it.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you have to show there's a

4

reasonable likelihood that the jury might have come to an

5

opposite conclusion.

6

MR. GITS:

Yes.

And Boyde teaches that the way

7

to do that is to look at the context of the entire case in

8

conjunction with the -- the instruction that was given in

9

this case.

And I want to start out that I -- I agree with

10

the State that the first thing this Court should do is

11

look at the instruction standing alone.

12

indicate that without reference to the context of the

13

case, the instruction standing alone does not support the

14

inference that Payton's post-crime evidence could be

15

considered.

16

And I want to

Now, I agree that in the context of the case,

17

the context of the case could change that consideration.

18

For instance, if the court, as this -- some member of this

19

Court already indicated, told the jury that factor (k) is

20

to encompass Payton's evidence, or even if the prosecutor

21

may have said to the jury during his argument, ladies and

22

gentlemen, although it might not seem like Payton's

23

evidence could be considered by you under factor (k), in

24

fact it can, then we would be left with a situation very

25

similar to Boyde where there really is no argument among

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

counsel as to whether or not the evidence could be

2

subsumed under (k).

3

case, would permit it.

4

And that, in the context of that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, on -- on that point -

5

and I -- I recognize it's -- it's not nearly as clean as

6

the hypothetical you present -- he did say -- this is the

7

prosecutor.

8

aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors, the

9

sentence should be death, and so let's just line these up,

The law in its simplicity is that if the

10

and then he talks about the -- the conversion.

11

were other parts of his argument that indicated by one

12

interpretation this is not mitigating under special (k) -

13

under factor (k).

14

up and you weigh one against the other.

15

MR. GITS:

So there

But here he does say that you line that

I -- I would respond to that by

16

saying two things.

17

ladies and gentlemen, I want to address some of -- of

18

Payton's evidence.

19

don't believe that it applies under factor (k).

20

he went on to discuss that evidence.

21

I certainly can't say he didn't.

22

He does say that, but after he says,

I'm not suggesting and I'm -- and I
But then

And I agree he did.

But -- but the real issue here is what effect

23

likely did that have on the jury, and I -- I'm indicating

24

that -- that given the preliminary -- his preliminary part

25

about it still doesn't apply but I will address it, that

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

is unlikely to give the jury any confidence that that

evidence could be considered.

3

concession that occurred in this case whatsoever.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's not at all a

Well, why wouldn't the jury

5

conclude -- why isn't it the most logical conclusion that,

6

gee, the judge had us sit here through eight witnesses and

7

listen to all that and he didn't exclude any part of it,

8

so of course we must consider it because otherwise we

9

wouldn't have been exposed to all of it?

10

MR. GITS:

That was a relevant consideration in

11

Boyde and I think a powerful consideration in Boyde and in

12

California v. Brown.

13

it's not relevant here.

19

Because of the context of this case,
Once the judge permits both

In order to

Well, they -- they always have

20

to say whether or not we're going to really weigh this or

21

is it just too tangential, and that's one way of saying,

22

well, this really isn't mitigating.

23

lawyers that it is mitigating in a sense that is -- that

24

is relevant and that it's there for the jury to give it

25

the weight that it chooses.

But jurors say, well, you

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

know, this -- this just is not important is what they're

2

saying.

3

MR. GITS:

Well, when the prosecutor says this

4

doesn't fall under (k) and the defense attorney says it

5

does fall under (k), all I'm indicating is that the

6

argument that this would be viewed as a charade no longer

7

has any effect.

8

court -- that the jury must look to.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It is now a preliminary thing that the

Well, it's a shorthand for

10

saying it doesn't fall under (k) because it just is of so

11

little weight.

12

have interpreted it.

13

Now, that's I think how the jury might

MR. GITS:

Yes, Your Honor, they might.

But the

14

issue here is whether or not there's a reasonable

15

likelihood that the jury did not consider that, and -- and

16

that's -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Actually that isn't really the

18

issue.

19

-- is whether the -- a person who thought about it

20

differently than me, a judge, would have -- be objectively

21

unreasonable.

22

The question you're arguing is not hard.

23
24
25

I think -- I find that easy.

The harder issue is

At least for me, that's the hard question.

MR. GITS:

I don't think I understand Your

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

come to a different conclusion than California Supreme

2

3

they're objectively unreasonable.

4

the hard thing because -- for me.

5

MR. GITS:

Yes.

And that's -- that's

I -- there is very -

6

relatively little guidance that we have so far on the

7

AEDPA.

8

relevance are both Wiggins v. Smith and Taylor v.

9

Williams.

I think the -- the cases that do have some

Wiggins v. Smith dealt with the failure of the

10

State court to actually evaluate evidence that occurred in

11

this case.

12

The California Supreme Court opinion on the

13

issue of whether or not the -- the court properly

14

conducted itself has one sentence, and the sentence says

15

-- and I'm paraphrasing -- something to the effect of the

16

fact that the court refused to adorn factor (k) is not in

17

itself a -- an error.

18

would concur that that's true, but that doesn't address

19

what happened here.

20

all-encompassing event that happened, something close -

21

and I have to be careful here -- something close to

22

structural error where the judge gives over the obligation

one JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, no, but I mean, that's -

3

that's really wrong what the judge did.

4

that -- that's tangential to the question.

5

is, is it reasonably likely, if that hadn't occurred, that

6

the jury would have considered the evidence that he was

didn't consider it.

considered it?

10

But -- but the The question

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Except if they heard so much

4

of the evidence, isn't it unlikely that the jury thought

5

they couldn't consider what they heard?

6

MR. GITS:

The more evidence they hear, the more

7

likely it is I think that human beings are going to

8

consider the evidence.

9

The evidence -- the -- the penalty evidence took

10

place over a 2-day period of time, but I want to indicate

11

that it took place over two half-day periods of time, and

12

that if you put the time together, I think it comes to

13

around 70 pages, which should be substantially less than a

14

half-day altogether.

15

and there was a lot of evidence brought out about post-

16

crime conduct.

17

as there was in Boyde, 400 pages and weeks of testimony.

18

So I think that that's a -- a -- an important

consideration too.

He starts off with an

instruction that's against him that supports, under any

natural reading, the prosecutor's language, and then he's

buttressed with a prosecutor that given the plain and

natural meaning of the language, is going to have a far

14

more compelling position with the jury about whether or

15

not it could be considered.

attorney's position is really nothing more than an

assertion, when he looks at the language itself -- an

assertion that it was awkwardly worded.

it is important evidence, but that's not the question.

The question is whether or not it could be considered

Well, as we pointed out in our brief,

20

this Court in -- in Skipper -- some Justices in -- in that

decision indicated that -- well, in fact, the majority

indicated that the post-crime evidence of rehabilitation

culpability.

given the right context, the right events happening at

trial, a jury would reasonably likely look at it as

3

covering that.

4

there wasn't anything that happened in Payton's trial

5

which permitted a reasonable inference that in fact that

evidence should be considered.

But not under this case, though, because

And as to harmless error, I -- as we pointed out

8

in our brief, it -- under the California statute, which in

9

effect requires that if the aggravating evidence outweighs

10

the mitigating evidence, the jury shall return a verdict

11

of death, if there's no reasonable likelihood that the

12

jury considered factor (k), then in effect Bill Payton was

left without any mitigating evidence to be considered by

the jury at all.

And that means that the jury had to come

Now, that brings this Court, once the Court -

if the Court becomes satisfied as to constitutional error,

18

that brings the Court, I think, very closely to -- to this

case -- this Court's case in Penry v. Johnson because

there the jury will not have had a vehicle in order to

21

give effect to Payton's mitigating evidence.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I see where you're going,

3

and I -- I see that there's some parallel.

Penry was that the jury -- the jurors had to actually

5

violate their instructions, and you have to escalate your

argument a bit before you get to that point.

7

MR. GITS:

Yes, I -- I agree.

The problem in

It's not exactly

8

identical, but we're very close to -- to that point in

Penry.

10

Beyond that, the prosecutor did argue

vociferously that the jury should -- in its determination,

12

should be concerned about whether or not Bill Payton is

13

going to stab the prison guards in the back, in effect,

14

argued dangerousness, which was appropriate.

evidence which plainly pointed to his lack of

dangerousness, his good adjustment in prison, his

conversion to Christianity.

was able to argue its side and -- and the jury wasn't

It's not relevant in terms of its impact as to
future cases.

There are some cases left that are still

dealing -- out there, dealing with factor (k).

11

12

there is about 70 cases dealing with the old, unadorned

factor (k), but of those 70 cases, none of them from -

14

and we haven't reviewed all of them, but of the ones we've

reviewed, none of them deal both with Payton's pure post-

made the decision that he thought the -- it could be

At the time of the

And the court

The -- the Court earlier talked about other

19

instructions as impacting upon the -- the context of the

20

case, and those were important considerations in Boyde,

21

especially the observation that the jury was to consider

22

any other evidence presented at either time in the trial.

23

But in the context of this case, Your Honor, it means

24

nothing.

25

ignore any evidence it heard at either phase of the trial

As I've indicated, the jury was required to

didn't fit within there, even though they heard that

3

evidence, they were instructed to ignore it.

4

If it

Beyond that, they were also instructed that the

5

-- that they were to consider the arguments of counsel.

6

Now, being that there was no clear instruction to the jury

7

that they had to consider factor (k) as being relevant

8

evidence, the jury then likely put greater weight on

9

counsel's argument, and that's why it becomes important.

10

So the other instructions, when you put them all

11

together, rather than putting in proper context what did

12

occur in this case, in effect make it even harder for Bill

Payton's position that the jury should consider factor (k)

to be relevant.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREA N. CORTINA

MS. CORTINA:

Justice Stevens, the real inquiry

objectively unreasonable.

20

-- Payton's counsel -

21

It is not whether there was a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Could you help me on that?

I

22

thought it was two steps.

23

whether there's a reasonable likelihood that the jury was

24

misled, and then you have to ask whether it was

25

unreasonable for the State supreme court to conclude that

I thought the question is

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there was that reasonable likelihood.

2

I'm wrong.

3

MS. CORTINA:

Or correct me if

That is one way of approaching the

4

case, but I think under AEDPA, what you'd look at, which

5

would be the more appropriate way, is how the California

6

Supreme Court analyzed the claim and not first conduct a

7

de novo review about whether there was a reasonable

8

likelihood.

9

much difference -

10
11
12

I don't think that in the end that there's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you can't overturn it on

habeas unless there's a reasonable likelihood.
MS. CORTINA:

Right.

That would be -- right.

13

You would have to find that the -- you would have to find

14

an error and one that was objectively -- and then the

15

California Supreme Court objectively unreasonable in not

16

finding the error.

17

reasonable likelihood test is a -- is a relevant inquiry,

18

but it is not the inquiry.

19

This is true.

So obviously the

And I think that -- that that's what Payton's

20

argument demonstrates and the Ninth Circuit's analysis

21

demonstrates, is that they are effectively equating a

22

decision that the California Supreme Court's conclusion

23

was incorrect with their personal -- in their subjective

24

opinion with a -- with the standard that the decision must

25

be objectively unreasonable.

And in this case, the

The California Supreme Court had little to no

Boyde's holding is broad.

Boyde held that

4

factor (k) was a broad, catchall mitigation instruction

5

that allowed for any other circumstance that counseled a

6

sentence less than death and specifically found that

7

background and character fell within the ambit of factor

8

(k).

9

Supreme Court in analyzing character has ever drawn a

And no decision of this Court or the California

10

distinction between post-crime and pre-crime character

11

evidence -

12
13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's a footnote in Boyde

that seems to draw that distinction.
MS. CORTINA:

The footnote in Boyde actually

15

supports more California's position that factor (k)

16

encompasses any other circumstance that would counsel a

17

sentence less than death as opposed to the Ninth Circuit

18

and Payton's interpretation that factor (k) is limited to

19

the crime.

20

In both the first part of footnote 5, the -- the

21

-- Chief Justice Rehnquist rejects the dissent's argument

22

that the gravity of the crime focused the consideration to

23

the circumstances of the crime.

24

jury to assess the seriousness of what the defendant has

25

done in light of what's the appropriate punishment, and

Rather, it allowed the

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that involves a consideration of the defendant's

2

background and character.

3

And then the last part of footnote 5 expressly

4

recognizes that factor (k) allows for consideration of

5

good character evidence, and good character evidence is

6

only relevant to a decision about whether the person

7

should live or die, not to circumstances related to the

8

crime.

9

Ninth Circuit's interpretation of factor (k) would not and

And good character evidence under Payton and the

10

could not, whether it existed pre or post-crime, fall

11

under the meaning of factor (k).

12

So the footnote 5 actually bolsters the ultimate

13

broad interpretation that the California Supreme Court

14

adopted when it applied Boyde -- Boyde's specific holding

15

concerning factor (k) to the analysis of Payton's claim.

16

And although they did, in footnote 5,

17

distinguish the fact that it did not involve post-crime

18

evidence in mitigation, it didn't decide the question.
