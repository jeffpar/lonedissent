Mr. Bullock.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT G. BULLOCK

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9

MR. BULLOCK:

Justice O'Connor, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about whether there are any

10

limits on government's eminent domain power under the

11

public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment.

12

home, church or corner store would produce more tax

13

revenue and jobs if it were a Costco, a shopping mall

14

or a private office building.

15

justification for the use of eminent domain, then any

16

city can take property anywhere within its borders

17

for any private use that might make more money than

18

what is there now.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Every

But if that's the

Mr. Bullock, you are

20

leaving out that New London was in a depressed

21

economic condition, so this is distinguished from the

22

case where the State has no particular reason for

23

wanting this, but the critical fact on the city side,

24

at least, is that this was a depressed community and

25

they wanted to build it up, get more jobs.

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, it's

2

important to point out it -- in first place that

3

chapter 132 of the statutory section at issue here

4

applies to every city within the State of

5

Connecticut, not those that are simply depressed.

6

And there is a fundamental difference

7

between an area like what was at issue in Berman, an

8

area that actually had problems and a city that has

9

certain problems.

Every city has problems.

Every

10

city would like to have more tax revenue, but that

11

cannot be a justification for taking the property -

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you concede that on

13

the facts, more than tax revenue was at stake.

14

community had gone down and down and the town wanted

15

to build it up.

16

MR. BULLOCK:

The

It is a desire to try to

17

improve the economy through tax revenue and jobs.

18

That is certainly the case.

19

justification for the use of eminent domain because

20

if the trickle down effects of economic development

21

are a justification, then there really is no limit on

22

the -

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that cannot be a

You don't concede, or do

24

you, that elevating the city from a depressed to

25

prosperous is a better justification than elevating a

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

city from prosperous to more prosperous?

2

MR. BULLOCK:

That is not -- that is

3

correct, Your Honor.

4

again applies to not so prosperous cities and

5

prosperous cities.

6

We do not.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And chapter 132

The line you draw is

7

between blight, which Berman says was in the public

8

use, lighted conditions okay, but depressed

9

conditions, not the best in line with the -

10

MR. BULLOCK:

Yes, Your Honor.

We think

11

that that is a line that this Court has drawn that is

12

area specific that focuses on the conditions in a

13

particular area.

14

removed the problematic areas.

15

blight.

16

And the condemnations in Berman

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It removed the

Oh, but Berman spoke,

17

in the opinion, said that the determination of the

18

legislature about these things is virtually

19

conclusive, that there is only the narrowest,

20

narrowest role for the judiciary.

21

standard are you proposing we should get into here to

22

second-guess the public use aspect?

23

MR. BULLOCK:

What kind of

Your Honor, it is clear that

24

eminent domain power is broad, but there has to be

25

limits, and that's what we are really talking about

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

here.

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, have we ever in

3

any case from this Court said that the limit has been

4

exceeded?

5

MR. BULLOCK:

In a few cases from earlier

6

in this century, Your Honor, the Missouri Pacific

7

case, the Thompson versus Consolidated Gas case, but

8

this Court has recognized for over 200 years that

9

there are limits on eminent domain power, that they

10

cannot be used for private cases.

11

a consistent strain throughout this Court's -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that has been

Justice Douglas says

13

there that as long as it's an objective within

14

Congress and legislature's legitimate grant of power,

15

they can do it, I mean, as long as there's a -- so

16

why does there have to be a limit within that broad

17

limit?

18
19

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, the limit

is that there cannot be takings for private use.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course, there can't,

21

purely.

22

you could imagine in reality that wouldn't also have

23

a public benefit of some kind, whether it's

24

increasing jobs or increasing taxes, et cetera.

25

That's a fact of the world.

But there is no taking for private use that

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And so given that fact of the world, that

2

is law, why shouldn't the law say, okay, virtually

3

every taking is all right, as long as there is some

4

public benefit which there always is and it's up to

5

the legislature.

6

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, we think that

7

that cuts way too broadly.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. BULLOCK:

And it puts Because?

Because then every property,

10

every home, every business can then be taken for any

11

private use.

12

For any private development project.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

It could only be

13

taken if there is a public use and there almost

14

always is.

15

not agree with my last empirical statement?

16
17
18

Now, do you agree with that, or do you

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, again, the eminent

domain power is broad, but there has to be limits.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, that's, of course,

19

my question.

20

empirical statement that there almost always is some

21

public benefit attached, then my question is, why

22

must there be a limit within that broad framework?

23

The question is, if you agree with the

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, I think

24

with public -- with just having a simple public

25

benefit, then there really is no distinction between

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

public and private uses.

2

upon this Court to state, for instance, in the Berman

3

case and in the Midkiff case, which we think are

4

really at the outer limits of government's eminent

5

domain -

6

And that is what we call

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But do you think those

7

were correctly decided or do you take issue with the

8

decision in those two cases?

9

MR. BULLOCK:

We think that those

10

decisions can be consistent with ruling in favor of

11

Petitioners in this particular case, Your Honor,

12

because -

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But you take the

14

position that a city that is suffering from enormous

15

lack of jobs and depression, economic depression,

16

that there is no public use purpose for taking land

17

to enable the creation of jobs?

18
19
20

MR. BULLOCK:

That is correct, Your Honor.

We do not JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, let's assume that

21

the city instead of taking the property by eminent

22

domain simply used its, its own -- some of its own

23

regular tax income to buy up the property, and

24

assembled parcels of land with the purpose of selling

25

them to an industrial developer to raise the tax base

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

and hence ultimately to raise taxes.
Would you say just within the meaning of

3

general understanding of proper governmental purposes

4

that the city was acting in a way that had no

5

legitimate public purpose?

6

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, I think

7

the question goes to whether or not the government

8

could use its police power to acquire property and

9

then sell it to a private developer.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I'm not interested

11

in the label.

12

we need to increase the tax base because we have a

13

depressed city, so we are going to take some of our

14

tax money now, and we are just going to buy up

15

property that people are willing to sell to us, and

16

we are going to assemble parcels.

17

big enough one, we are going to sell it to a

18

developer for industrial purposes.

19

that will raise the tax base.

20

illegitimate as a purpose for governmental spending

21

in doing that?

22

I'm just saying if the government says

MR. BULLOCK:

And when we get a

And that will,

Is there anything

No, Your Honor.

We do not

23

believe that that would be some legitimate because

24

it's not a public use.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why isn't there a public

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

purpose here?

2

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, because

3

this case affects the eminent domain power, which is

4

regulated by the Fifth Amendment -

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but we are talking

6

about -- I mean, I realize that, but I mean, I

7

thought your point was that it was use of eminent

8

domain power for an improper purpose.

9

characterize that purpose as conveying property to

10

And you

private owners.

11

Well, in my example, the same thing is

12

going on except that it's not using the eminent

13

domain power.

14

proper public purpose, why isn't it a proper public

15

purpose when the government does it by eminent

16

domain?

If the purpose in my example is a

What changes about the purpose?

17

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, because of the

18

public use restriction of the Amendment.

19

we really -

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what

Mr. Bullock, do you

21

equate purpose with use?

22

Does the public use requirement mean nothing more

23

than that it have a public purpose?

24

MR. BULLOCK:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are the two terms the same?

No, Your Honor.
That's your answer to

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Souter.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if that is your

3

answer then the slum clearance cases have got to go

4

the other way.

5

MR. BULLOCK:

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm sorry If that is your answer,

7

then I suppose the slum clearance cases were wrongly

8

decided.

9

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, your Honor, this Court

10

did hold in Berman and Midkiff that the police power

11

and eminent domain power are coterminous.

12

holding especially of this Court's opinion in

13

Midkiff.

14

filed in this case, amicus briefs filed in this case

15

that have called upon this Court to re-examine that.

16

And of course, this Court is free to do so.

17

That was a

And there are certain amici that have been

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you are saying we

18

don't have to re-examine it, but I think your

19

adoption of Justice Scalia's approach puts you in a

20

difficult -- I think you're moving in the direction

21

of saying we really have got to overrule the prior

22

cases.

23

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, I think under

24

a -- perhaps an original understanding of the takings

25

clause, there was a difference between public use and

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

public domain.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Just for the moment, what

3

about my question?

4

you want to, and I tend to be interested in that, but

5

my immediate concern is, if you give the answer that

6

you have just given, doesn't it jeopardize the

7

precedent of the slum clearance cases?

8
9

And you can get into history, if

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, I don't think

so, because of the caveat in Berman and Midkiff that

10

eminent domain cannot be used for private uses.

11

that is what is really at issue here.

12

was the focus of -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

What I think

But that's what they

14

were being used for in Berman and -- everybody knows

15

that private developers were the beneficiaries in

16

Berman.

17

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, I believe the

18

justifications focused upon the removal of the

19

offensive conditions in Berman, that the public

20

purpose, if you want to call it that, was served once

21

the blight was removed, the public purpose was served

22

once the oligopoly was broken up.

23

that --

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Here the focus is

As I understand, you're

test then -- you want me to make a distinction between

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

blight which is a permissible governmental use,

2

governmental objective and economic revival, which

3

isn't?

4

MR. BULLOCK:

Under the eminent domain

5

authority, Your Honor, we think that -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

want me to draw.

8
9

Is that the line you

MR. BULLOCK:

Yes.

And we think that that

is a line -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose an

11

economist or even a judge might say, well, it's

12

very clear that if this economic depression continues

13

for another five years we are going to have blight.

14

Blight is in the eye of the beholder, I know that.

15

MR. BULLOCK:

Exactly.

And I think that

16

that is really one of the dangers of the majority

17

opinion here is that it puts any property up for

18

grabs.

19

to -- governments have to meet a certain objective

20

criteria to satisfy that this is actually a blighted

21

area.

22

Under the blight statutes, they actually have

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why isn't it an

23

objective criteria to say that we are going to have

24

economic revival, avoid economic downturns?

25

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, because, I

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

think -- to get back to the decisions in Berman and

2

Midkiff, what this Court I think focused on there is

3

that the public use or the public purpose was direct

4

and immediate.

5

condemnations and it was immediately served by the

6

removal of the blight and the breaking up of the

7

oligopoly.

8
9

It was served directly by the

In economic development condemnations, the
only public benefits that come about, if they come

10

about at all, are completely dependent upon private

11

parties actually making a profit.

12

profits then somehow -

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that those

That's the same thing

that is true in the railroads in the west.

15

MR. BULLOCK:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But Precisely the

17

description you gave applied to the railroads in the

18

west.

19

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, Your Honor, those were

20

justified under I think the line of cases that held

21

that those were really essential for land assembly

22

for instrumentalities of commerce.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They were -

And this seems to be

24

really essential for the purpose of developing

25

industrial property to increase the tax base.

The

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

argument is, and I don't know of any reason to doubt

2

it, that doing it seriatim by voluntary acquisition

3

and sale doesn't work.

4

So the rationale for this is essentially

5

the rationale for the railroads, for the public

6

utility line condemnations and so on.

7

another practical way to do it.

8

public benefit at the end, and that ought to qualify

9

it as a public use.

10

MR. BULLOCK:

There isn't

And there is a

Your Honor, there are many

11

ways to do economic development without condemnation.

12

It happens every single day in this country.

13

the states that prohibit the use of eminent domain

14

simply for private business development, those states

15

do make the distinction between blighted areas and

16

simply their communities wanting to take advantage of

17

more tax revenue.

18

And in

And those states are doing fine.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though in Berman,

19

there was a department store that was not blighted,

20

and it was permissible because the whole area was to

21

be improved to raze that department store, even

22

though it wasn't contributing in any way to blight.

23

MR. BULLOCK:

Yes, Your Honor.

But the

24

Court in Berman held that there were certain

25

properties that even though they might have been

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

nonblighted, it was essential to have those

2

properties in order to remove the blight from the

3

area that was at issue.

4

government to get certain properties even though they

5

might have been nonblighted.

6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So there was the ability of

Here Mr. Bullock, would you

7

articulate the test that you would propose the Court

8

adopt.

9

should use the substantially advances test, so-called

Some amici and others have argued that we

10

test from regulatory takings.

11

articulate?

12
13

MR. BULLOCK:

What tests do you

Well, for our bright line

rule, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

MR. BULLOCK:

Yes.

The test should be that the

16

government cannot take property simply so that the

17

new owners can put it to ordinary private uses of

18

land.

19

That's really the test.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And the Well, that's not what's

20

asserted here, of course.

21

doing this for purposes of enhancing economic

22

development of a very poor city.

Here the city says, we are

23

MR. BULLOCK:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

that alleged purpose?

True, Your Honor, but So what do we do with

What is your test?

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3
4
5

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, the test, Your Honor,

for JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Is it no economic

development purpose?
MR. BULLOCK:

Yes.

Yes.

When it's only

6

justified in order to gain the secondary benefits

7

from ordinary private uses of land, and the way that

8

businesses always make use of their land to try to

9

make money or to try to make a profit.

10

That's our

bright line rule.

11

But for our second test, if this Court

12

accepts that economic development can be a public

13

use, then we advocate a test of reasonably

14

foreseeable uses and minimum standards in order to

15

counter the dangers posed by such private involvement

16

in the use of eminent domain power.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's the latter.

I

18

mean, I understand the former.

19

and it comes to me now you're getting to what I

20

think is a possible realm of reason here.

21

second part now you said and minimum standards.

22

What minimum standards?

23

MR. BULLOCK:

That's a big retreat

But the

Well, the dissent in the

24

Connecticut Supreme Court talked a lot about minimum

25

standards that should be in place in order to ensure

17
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that public benefits actually come about.

2

could be such things as a commencement date for the

3

project, a construction schedule, financial

4

eligibility for the developers, there's a number of

5

different things.

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I mean, are you

advocating particular ones?

8
9

Those

MR. BULLOCK:

Not particular ones, just

the standard actually be in place and we think that

10

the dissent provides some good guideposts for

11

establishing -

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

The remaining test is the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that approaching --

--

14
15

Isn't that in effect changing the test from public

16

use to efficient public use?

17

know, if I condemn land for a public utility and the

18

public utility turns out to be very inefficient, has

19

the condemnation been invalid?

20

MR. BULLOCK:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

I mean, what's -- you

Your Honor.
Do you want us to sit

22

here and evaluate the prospects of each condemnation

23

one by one?

24
25

MR. BULLOCK:

No, Your Honor, what we are

advocating for, and utilities of course are

But what we are talking about are certain

4

minimum standards in place at the time of

5

condemnation to try to have some type of reasonable

6

certainty that the public benefits are to come about

7

so we are not talking about ongoing oversight.

8

are simply talking about minimum standards at the

9

time of the, at the time of the condemnation.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We

I take it there isn't,

11

but maybe there is, there isn't any question in this

12

case that the city was acting in good faith and

13

did -- and I presume still does -- intend to convey

14

it to developers who will, will actually proceed to

15

develop a project.

16
17
18

Is there a question about that?

MR. BULLOCK:

A question of whether or not

the procedure JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, in other words, I

19

can understand perfectly well, why we would want to

20

draw a distinction between the use of the eminent

21

domain power that takes a parcel of property from

22

private person A and simply then reconveys it to

23

private person B without any particular object in

24

mind except that the city likes B, you know, the

25

mayor is the Democrat and B is the Democrat.

That

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

kind of thing.

2

So I can understand the need for some

3

distinction between that case and what we've got

4

here.

5

minimum standards, I guess, is do we have a problem

6

historically or in this case about the good faith of

7

the taking so that we need the minimum standards to

8

make sure that we are not getting into the first

9

example?

The question is when you say there have to be

10

Yes, Your Honor.

is a number of reasons why there has to be reasonably

Is there a reason in this

Is there some doubt here?

15

MR. BULLOCK:

Well, it goes to the doubt

16

about whether or not the public benefits will

17

actually come about in this case.

18

are really for speculative purposes, pure speculative

19

purposes.

20

come into play to ensure -

The takings here

And that's where the minimum standards

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But do you really want

22

courts to be in the business of trying to weigh the

23

evidence to see if the utility will be successful or

24

the hospital will be successful or the road will be

25

well constructed?

I mean, what kind of a test are

1

you proposing?

2

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, our test is

3

limited really to the condemnations that are

4

completely dependent upon the private businesses

5

actually being successful, and that those benefits

6

coming about so it would not affect utilities or

7

anything like that.

8

should require that the government actually name a

use.

But at a minimum, this Court

Does the record tell us

11

anything about how often takings by eminent domain

12

for economic development occur in this country?

13

it frequent?

Is

What are we dealing with?

MR. BULLOCK:

It is, it is frequent, Your

15

Honor.

16

that looks specifically at condemnations for economic

17

development, but after the Michigan court's decision

18

in Poletown, they became commonplace.

There's no -- we do not know of any study

19

And you had properties -- business that

20

were being condemned for casinos, other homes that

21

were taken for automobile manufacturers.

22

Michigan Supreme Court saw that as a disaster.

23

overturned that.

In all of those cases, I

Let me ask you this, and it's a little

opposite of the particular question presented.

8

there any writings or scholarship that indicates that

when you have property being taken from one private

person ultimately to go to another private person,

11

that what we ought to do is to adjust the measure of

12

compensation, so that the owner -- the condemnee -

13

can receive some sort of a premium for the

14

development?

15

MR. BULLOCK:

16

scholarship about that.

17

held that the property owner is simply entitled to

18

just compensation of the appraised value of the

19

property.

20

There may be some
This Court has consistently

Of course, the property owner JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you have to prescind

21

the project when you fix the value.

22

MR. BULLOCK:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm sorry?
You have to prescind the

24

project -- you have to -- you have to ignore the

25

project when you determine the value.

The value is a

to the project.

Yes, that is right.

And so

they simply get the -

if there has been any scholarship to indicate that

maybe that compensation measure ought to be adjusted

when A is losing property for the economic benefit of

B.

10

MR. BULLOCK:

I believe there has been

11

some scholarship about it, but we think it's vital

12

that there be a public use requirement in those

13

takings as well.

JUSTICE BREYER:
standard.

Can I ask you about the

Go back for a second.

16

MR. BULLOCK:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
I gather that the Iowa

18

courts have a standard that includes whether there is

19

a reasonable likelihood that the intended public use

20

will take place.

21

advocating?

22

Now, is that the standard you're

MR. BULLOCK:

It's similar to our

23

reasonable foreseeability test that we set forth in

24

our brief that this Court actually talked about in

25

the Vester case as well, and a number of the other

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

state cases that are cited in our brief that

2

establish that there has to be a use for the property

3

and that that use has to be reasonably perceived.

4
5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there a lot of

disagreement about this?

6

MR. BULLOCK:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, there's not.
I mean, it seems to me

8

you might -- whether there is a reasonable assurance

9

that there will in fact be the public use which the

10

state uses as the justification for taking the

11

property.

12
13
14

Is that going to help you that much?
MR. BULLOCK:

I think it will provide

important minimal standards of protection for JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I mean, I don't see

15

how this Court could get into the business of saying

16

you have to have this by a particular day or you have

17

to have 14 witnesses.

18

that sort of thing, could we?

19
20
21
22
23

I mean, we couldn't impose

MR. BULLOCK:

Your Honor, I think just the

standard needs to be in place.
JUSTICE BREYER:

There needs to be a

reasonable assurance.
MR. BULLOCK:

Exactly.

Or at the very

24

least, a reasonable foreseeability as well, which is

25

at a minimum that is not even in place in this

divided into what, seven areas?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Right.
And there's some -- to

No, Your Honor.

being conveyed.

Okay.

I completely agree with that,

but if the primary purpose of the takings clause is

15

not to regulate legislative determinations of that,

for is two tests.

Railroad, and another test for Kelo.

will in fact take place.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That may be, but what do

you think of that test?
MR. HORTON:

I don't, I don't agree.

I

don't think it's necessary to do that, because if you

13

have that test, you have to say, well, what do I do

14

about, about other areas than this.

Berman is an excellent example of that,

because as Justice Ginsburg said, Mr. Berman's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Horton, what, what

2

difference does it make that, that New London was in

an economic depression?

4

much, under your theory of a public use, for a city

5

to say, yes, we are not doing badly, but we could do

better.

You can't possibly draw a line between depressed

cities and undepressed cities, can you?

Would it not be fully as

Let's attract some high-tech industry here.

MR. HORTON:

I would not draw a line.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You wouldn't.

And you

wouldn't ask us to do it either.
MR. HORTON:

I would not ask -- I have a

13

back-up argument that you do not need to reach that

14

issue here in light of the facts of this case.

15

I -- to be candid with you, my view is that the test

16

you have is -- there is no principle -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Any city can do it.

And

18

in the hypothetical that Justice Souter gave earlier

19

where, you know, you couldn't take it from A and give

it to B, because B is a good Democrat, you could take

21

it from A and give it to B if B is richer, and would

pay higher municipal taxes, couldn't you?

Yes, Your Honor.

a caveat on that.

Isn't that exactly what

MR. HORTON:

Your Honor, my position is

7

that purely taking from one person to give to another

8

that shows no public benefit other than just giving

from -- taking from one person to another would not

10

be a public use.

11

A good example is the Missouri Pacific

14

taking that was not a regulatory taking.

15

The one case in 200 years of this Court's

I would also point out that there are a

16

few cases around the country where it does not

It -- the trial judge there didn't say it

was just for a public purpose -- a private purpose,

but he said it was overwhelmingly just for the Trump

5

Scalia's hypothetical about more taxes, then I say

6

that's sufficient, as long as you get over -

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that what the

8

Connecticut Supreme Court that we are reviewing said,

you -- you are arguing, it seems to me, for something

10

that goes beyond what was adjudicated in this case.

11

I mean -

12

MR. HORTON:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
It was a finding, a

14

finding before to be a fact in the trial court that

15

this development was going to be primarily for the

16

benefit of the citizens of New London, and not for

17

the benefit of Pfizer or the private developer.

18

MR. HORTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

I agree

19

with that and that is why I say my back-up position

is you don't need to determine whether you go beyond

The next phase is then three and four,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What's planned for 3

and 4-A?

5

MR. HORTON:

What's planned for 3 is that

6

it's going to be office space.

7

is there is going to be a demand for class A office

8

space, which is the best quality office space in this

9

area by 2010.

And the expectation

And the expectation is that it will

10

attract the sorts of offices that will feed on the

11

Pfizer.

They spent $300 million on a site here.

12

In addition, I may point out, this is the

13

Amtrak line going along here.

14

get to parcels 1 and 2 is to go right by parcel 3 or

15

go right by parcel 4-A.

16

The only way you can

This is a waste water treatment facility.

17

Parcel 4-A is for park support or marina support.

18

Now, it isn't more definitive, but obviously, one

19

possible use is for parking here because you've got a

20

waste water treatment facility here.

21

park here.

22

the other parcels here.

23

You've got the

You've got the marina here and you've got

It's not like we are talking, as in

24

Berman, you're talking about something that's in the

25

parcel.

And in Berman, they said it's not for the

1

court to decide where the boundary lines ought to be.

2

It seems to me that's another point, Justice

3

O'Connor.

4

It's not like parcel 3 JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, can't the courts at

5

least -- can't the courts, could the courts -- do you

6

object to this, and I'm not advocating it, I want

7

your reaction.

8

MR. HORTON:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, Your Honor.
Could the courts, under

10

this clause, at least review what you've just said

11

for reasonableness?

12

reasonableness of a claim that this is for -

13

basically for a public use.

14

reasonableness of the claim that we should do it this

15

way, rather than excusing the people who don't want

16

to sell their houses no matter what and doing it a

17

little bit differently.

18

I mean, look at the

Look at the

Reasonableness is a concept that's already

19

in the Constitution in terms of what the legislature

20

can do, but I'm thinking of the stronger kind of

21

reasonableness review that you might have in an

22

administrative action.

23

want a case.

24

you might find appropriate here?

25

Now, is, Overton Park, if you

Is that a possible kind of review that

MR. HORTON:

No, Your Honor, if what

37
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you're defining as reasonableness is being higher

2

than rational basis.

3

you're applying a higher standard for a taking where

4

we are paying for it than you would be for -

5

Because in that situation,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the reason that you

6

would apply a somewhat higher standard is because the

7

rational basis, with tremendous deference, applies to

8

the power of Congress to act in an economic area in

9

the absence of a particular constitutional provision

10

designed to protect a minority from the actions of

11

the majority.

12

And if you read that public purpose

13

doctrine, a section here as having that in mind, you

14

might want a somewhat higher level of review.

15

that's the whole thing spelled out.

16

advocating it.

17

to get your reaction.

18

Now,

I'm not

But I am putting it forward to get -

MR. HORTON:

Your Honor, that same type of

19

remark could be made about rational basis equal

20

protection review.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, and indeed with equal

22

protection, we very often do have a somewhat higher

23

standard of review.

24
25

MR. HORTON:

Ah, yes, Your Honor, but the

point here is that you should not have a higher

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

standard of review because we are paying for it.

2

would be ironic to have a higher test than for

3

example in a regulatory taking or even the same test.

4

You have a test in Nollan and Dolan, for example,

5

which is an exactions case.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It

So that's to say Mr. Horton, you're paying

7

for it, but you're also taking property from somebody

8

who doesn't want to sell it.

9

nothing?

Does that count for

Yes, you're paying for it, but you're

10

giving the money to somebody who doesn't want the

11

money, who wants to live in the house that she's

12

lived in her whole life.

13
14
15

MR. HORTON:

That counts for nothing?

No, of course not, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, then, let me ask -

16

would, would the reasonableness standard, if the

17

project is indeed reasonable, and there is genuine

18

prospect that all of these good things that you're

19

talking about will happen, why wouldn't private money

20

come in to further the project?

21

to condemn it if it's so reasonable.

part, parcel.

plaintiffs who are not going to sell at any price.

They want to stay there.

9

you can say, well, go somewhere else.

You have a situation where you've got the

12

That's the only place anything is going to work and

it's -- and it's five to six square miles of town.

How much, how much of

this was voluntarily sold, is that correct?

19

MR. HORTON:

The large share of it was,

21

background the possibility of being able to condemn

22

it.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That may be.

Now, that's

2

why I'm back to reasonableness.

3

in the briefs that the people who often might hold

4

out, might be doing so to get more money, but it

5

might also be because they are poor, they are not

6

well connected politically, and their only hope is to

7

go to a court and stop this thing.

You see, we are told

So you'd give them two weapons.
one is you have to pay them.

Weapon

That's correct.

Compensation.

11

a test of being reasonable.

12

deferential test, so you might have every leg up.

13

But they at least could catch the instances where

14

this is really not reasonable to do to them what

15

you're doing to them that they don't want.

16

And weapon two is they can put you to

MR. HORTON:

That might be quite a

I have two responses to that,

17

Your Honor.

First of all, that applies to all sorts

18

of takings.

If I'm building a road, let me give you

19

an example of the Rindge case that Your Honors

20

decided in the 1920s.

21

That was the road to nowhere.

It was a

22

road that went through a farm to the county line.

23

And the other county had no intention at that point

24

of building a road, but Your Honors said, well, they

25

might get around to it at sometime so it's a good

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

idea to build it now.

2

We had a similar situation in Hartford.

3

There is supposed to be a ring road around Hartford,

4

and the State condemned all this land for a ring road

5

around Hartford.

6

and then just this, this year, in very low print in

7

the last page of the newspaper, we see about the

8

state getting around to selling the land because they

9

didn't, they didn't do it.

10

Well, one little bit of it was done

I mean, this can happen in the railroad

11

case is a good example.

12

Your Honors decided.

13

carrier makes all the difference, then how come the

14

ICC just didn't order the Boston & Maine to fix the

15

railroad?

16

to make a -

17

The railroad case.

The one

If it's -- being a common

You know.

Why?

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, you didn't look

Common carriers are

18

subject to state regulation to a degree that private

19

companies are not.

20

comers alike.

21

utility cases are at all comparable to condemning

22

land in order to get a new company to move in and pay

23

more taxes.

24
25

They must, they must treat all

I mean, I don't think the public

I just don't think it's similar.
MR. HORTON:

Well, I would like to point

out that the -- there is a difference, the whole

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

point is about having a test about reasonable

2

assurances about whether something is going to happen

3

and that's where the railroad case makes a

4

difference.

QUESTION:

6

MR. HORTON:

I agree with you on that.
That's the only point I was

7

making, Your Honor.

8

that.

9

made a point about poor people.

I didn't mean to go further than

But coming back to Justice Breyer's point, you
And I'd like to

10

point out, unless you're going to overrule Berman,

11

you know, poor people and minorities are more likely

12

to be vulnerable in the blight cases than in this

13

case.

14

I mean, this is a good example.

Economic

15

development can take place anywhere in town.

16

happens in one area of town where the poor and the

17

minorities are likely to live, and in fact, this very

18

case, we have got middle class people.

19

blight that's been alleged in the condemnation

20

papers.

21

Blight

There is no

The other thing is if you stick to blight,

22

this is the problem you're going to have.

23

going to end up making a blight jurisprudence

24

because -- because what's going to happen is the

25

cities are going to say, we can only do this by

You're

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

blight, so they are going to have marginal

2

definitions of blight.

3

Florida, for example, says property is

4

blighted if it's vacant.

5

you're going to have a big headache in that -

6

Is that blight?

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean,

No, I'm accepting that

7

you can't make that kind of a distinction.

8

where I'm focusing on a test that would possibly

9

apply only where you transfer property from one

That's

10

private person to another, but still wouldn't make

11

those distinctions of blight or not blight.

12

MR. HORTON:

Yes.

But I mean, the other

13

thing is, are you going to make -- would the Court

14

make a distinction between a case where the city is

15

doing the developing itself, and another case where

16

the city gives it to a private person.

17

I'd like to point out, my client is going

18

to keep the property.

19

leased to a developer.

20

the developer.

21

building on this property, and then doesn't comply,

22

they are in big trouble.

23

It's -- it's going to be
It's not going to be sold to

So I mean, if this developer builds a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It does seem ironic that

24

100 percent of the premium for the new development

25

goes to the, goes to the developer and to the

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

taxpayers and not to the property owner.

2

MR. HORTON:

Well, that's an interesting

3

point.

4

side about whether there should be -

A question was raised earlier about the other

5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The compensation

measures.

7

MR. HORTON:

The compensation measures.

8

Exactly.

9

if there is some -- if there is some scholarly

10

By the way, the answer to your question is

articles on that, I'm not aware of it either.

11

But I would point out that's something,

12

you know, in terms of social costs and things like

13

that, that is something that this Court might or

14

might not wish to consider in a just compensation

15

case, but I don't think it should affect whether you

16

take the property or not.

17

I'm not taking a position on that one way or another,

18

but it seems to me that's -- you have to assume in

19

this case that there is going to be just

20

compensation.

21

It seems to me that is -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

On that point, just in

22

Connecticut, if the property owner goes to the jury

23

and receives more than the state offered, does the

24

state also have to pay those attorneys' fees?

25

MR. HORTON:

Under -- under state law?

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Under Connecticut law,

2

if the property owner is offered $100 but goes to the

3

jury and gets $200, does the property owner have to

4

pay the attorneys' fees or does the state pay the

5

attorneys' fees?

6

MR. HORTON:

The state does not pay

7

attorneys' fees, Your Honor.

8

attorneys' -- and likewise, the other way, if it's

9

lower amount than what was put in than, you know,

10

it's not as though the state gets attorneys' fees

11

back.

12

Everybody pays his own

It works both ways.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Horton, what do you

13

think is the reason that there are not a lot of

14

examples of the sort that I think one of Justice

15

O'Connor's hypotheticals raised, in which the, I

16

don't know, the Econoline Motel gets condemned so

17

that the Ritz can be built, thereby increasing tax

18

revenue and so on, kind of parcel by parcel

19

augmentations to the tax base and so on.

20

there a lot of examples like that?

21

MR. HORTON:

Why aren't

I think there is two good

22

reasons for it, and that it's a theoretical more than

23

a practical problem.

24

sorts of transaction costs when you, when you go

25

through eminent domain, as opposed to doing things

First of all, you've got all

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

voluntarily.

2

So you are not going to do things -- as a

3

as a practical matter, to take Justice Scalia's

4

earlier example, for one piece of property because of

5

the transaction costs involved.

6

going to make up -- unless it's to, you know, to

7

favor the governor's friend or something like that,

8

as you say.

the democratic process, Your Honor.

19

especially if the taxpayers are paying for something

20

and you know, they are getting a bad reason or run

21

around about the reason, you know, that's subject to

22

review.

23

And the other thing, there is
I mean,

It seems to me democracy can make good

24

decisions and -- or bad decisions under the

25

Constitution, but the important thing is that when

are, you know, the taxpayers don't see that until

You know, in this type of taking, the

He bought the

It's worth half a million.

He

He pays 30 percent to the Government and

13

the state in taxes, and then he has to live

14

somewhere.

15

He now has probably 350,000 to pay for a house.

16

gets half a house because that's all he is going to

17

do, all he is going to get for that money after he

18

paid the taxes, or whatever.

19

Well, I mean, what's he supposed to do?
He

And I mean, there are a lot of -- and he

20

has to move and so forth.

21

Kennedy's point, is there some way of assuring that

22

the just compensation actually puts the person in the

23

position he would be in if he didn't have to sell his

24

house?

25

So going back to Justice

Or is he inevitably worse off?
MR. HORTON:

whether they were loans or not, and it is correct

that they are loans.

in relocation funds.

The other side pointed out that

That's not

But the loans don't make

Isn't -

12

MR. HORTON:

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's true.
I mean, what bothered

14

Justice Breyer I guess bothers a lot of us.

15

is, is there a problem of making the homeowner or the

16

property owner whole?

17

that is that goes to the measure of compensation

18

which is not the issue here.

19

MR. HORTON:

And that

But I suppose the answer to

Yes.

And that's, and I had

20

said that earlier.

21

talking about roads is that applies to -- that could

22

apply to any type of case.

23

a case like this.

24
25

But another point when I was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't just apply to

And that would really

overrule a bunch of prior cases and really throw

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

condemnation law into chaos.

2

MR. HORTON:

Yes.

And Justice Scalia, a

3

question you -- or actually it was a comment you had

4

made about public use versus public purpose.

5

that would not only overrule -- and my opposing

6

counsel said there is a difference between the two.

7

And when pressed by Justice Souter -- and I would

8

point out, that's just overruling cases going back to

9

Berman.

10

And

That's overruling two decisions by JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the remedy?

11

Let's repose the problem to which I want to remedy

12

then.

13

And maybe this isn't the right remedy.
But the remedy that they are saying, and

14

I'm really repeating it, is an individual has a house

15

and they want to be really not made a lot worse off,

16

at least not made a lot worse off just so some other

17

people can get a lot more money.

18

the right -- is there no constitutional protection?

19

If this isn't the right case, what is?

20

MR. HORTON:

Now what, what is

Well, the right case is in

21

the just compensation concept, but going to your,

22

your point, if this were here as just compensation, I

23

would say in terms of just compensation, in deciding

24

what the fair market value is today, you can

25

certainly take into account the economic plan that's

50
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

going into effect.

2

You know -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Really?

I thought that

3

that was a fundamental of condemnation law that you

4

can not value the property being taken based on what

5

it's going to be worth after the project.

6

just -

7

MR. HORTON:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

is much different from any other state.

13

MR. HORTON:

That's

subject, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

to pay more taxes.

that's an objection in principle, and an objection in

Holmes' decisions to be overruled.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I think you'd

8

have to take some substantial chunks of language out

9

of Berman as well, because Justice Douglas spoke very

10
11

expansively in that case.
MR. HORTON:

Plus I think Holmes was right

12

when he said that to say that the public actually has

13

to use the property is not an appropriate meaning of

14

the phrase, so I would not think you'd want to

15

revisit that case, even if you want to revisit some

16

other of Holmes' decisions.

17

But the -- I guess the best answer I have,

18

Justice Breyer, to your question, after I, after I

19

misspoke is simply to go back to the point that the

20

time at which you consider what just compensation is,

21

is in the just compensation proceedings.

22

And while I misspoke about what the test

23

was, and I apologize for that, certainly this Court

24

can consider if social costs should be taken into

25

account at that time.

I'm not saying they should.

I

haven't thought that through as can you obviously see

2

by my misanswering the question, but it seems to me

3

because my primary answer is that you don't look at

4

that now.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, the tax

6

code does have special provisions for involuntary

7

sales and reinvestments.

8

MR. HORTON:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

Yes, it does.
The tax hypothetical is

not accurate.

11

MR. HORTON:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
Mr. Horton, I'm not

13

proposing that the state has to use the property

14

itself.

15

private use which has incidental benefits to the

16

state.

17

condemnation power.

I'm simply proposing that its use not be a

That is not enough to justify use of the

18

MR. HORTON:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I don't think You can give it to a

20

private entity, you can give it to a railroad, to

21

some public utility.

22

that railroad and public utility is a public use.

23

That's why it's a public utility.

24
25

But the use that it's put to by

It's quite different to say you can give
it to a private individual simply because that

53
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

private individual is going to hire more people and

2

pay more taxes.

3

out entirely the distinction between private use and

4

public use.

5

That, it seems to me, just washes

MR. HORTON:

Well, I don't agree, Your

6

Honor, because I think, you know, I think if a person

7

is without a job and if a person is not able to get

8

basic services that they need from the town because

9

the town can't afford it, that's just as important as

10

a trains running on time or eliminating blight.

11

And Justice Breyer, I thought of another

12

answer to your question that has to do with this

13

case.

14

because the Connecticut Supreme Court applied a

15

higher test in this case.

16

And that is even on a higher test, we win

And just -- I would say that in this case,

17

the essence of federalism is to let various courts

18

make various decisions about what they consider an

19

important public purpose.

20

Utah from the way it is in Connecticut, and it's

21

different in Florida, and I don't think this Court

22

should be having a new jurisprudence for this area

23

and having two separate tests, and maybe having a

24

test that even approaches the Nollan Dolan test where

25

you certainly want to discourage people from taking

It may be different in

54

1

these actions.

2

And so it seems to me the four words I

3

think that this Court should consider -- and I'm not

4

going to tell you the four words since my red light

5

is on.

7

Thank you, Your Honor.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY SCOTT G. BULLOCK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Bullock, do you know

those four words?

12

MR. BULLOCK:

I wish I did.

I could

13

respond to it if I -- if I actually did.

14

Honors, first of all, just a couple of matters

15

regarding the Connecticut Supreme Court's decision.

16

The Connecticut Supreme Court did not apply the test

17

that we suggest in our case, they explicitly, the

18

majority explicitly declined to apply heightened

19

scrutiny in this, in this instance.

20

Your

I think the key to understanding their

21

argument is the answer to the question of, can you

22

take a Motel 6 and give it to a fancier hotel?

23

answer is yes.

condemns the 99 cents store in order to give it to

3

Costco.

Now, were they giving enormous benefits to

4

Costco?

Of course they were.

5

because they wanted to get the tax revenue, and

6

that's the problem with these types of condemnations,

7

the desire to help a private party and the desire to

8

help the public are really one and the same.

public only benefits if the private party is

The NLDC is a private body.

Also, Your Honor, the Rindge case that was

cited by the Respondents, they actually knew what was

They knew what

And finally, Your Honors, the Respondents

4

talk about the effect that this may have upon poor

5

people.

6

neighborhoods are blighted.

7

all poor neighborhoods share in common is that they

8

don't produce much in the way of tax revenue, so

9

you're going to put poor neighborhoods and working

Not all neighborhoods, not all poor
But the one thing that

10

class neighborhoods like the ones that exist in Fort

11

Trumbull in jeopardy if the Court affirms the

12

decision below.

13

And that's why so many organizations that

14

are concerned about the rights of senior citizens and

15

the rights of minorities and poor folks like legal

16

services corporations have joined in our side to

17

support the property owners in this case.

is no further questions, Your Honors, I will close.

Thank you.
