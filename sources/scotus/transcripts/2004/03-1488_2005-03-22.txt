CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 03-1488, Ulysses Tory v. Johnnie L. Cochran.
Mr. Chemerinsky.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Good morning.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The injunction in this case violates the most

11

basic principles of the First Amendment.

12

restraint.

13

It's vastly overbroad.

14

those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as

15

Petitioner Ruth Craft.

16

It's a prior

It's a content-based restriction on speech.
It even restricts the speech of

The injunction in this case is inconsistent with

17

this country's unique and profound commitment that speech

18

by public officials and public figures be open, robust,

19

and uninhibited.

20

One way in which the injunction is clearly

21

unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who

22

are not a party to the lawsuit.

23

is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about

24

Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party

25

to the lawsuit.

For example, Ruth Craft

And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the

2

lawsuit.

3
4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

How about you?

You're in

trouble too, aren't you?

5

(Laughter.)

6

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, I am, Your Honor.

This

7

injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie

8

Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this

9

Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any

10

reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I

11

could be held in contempt of court.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak

13

about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts.

14

I thought that you were not challenging -- at least the

15

question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging --

16

the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from

17

Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which

18

is an anti-harassment provision.

19

correctly that it is only the second one that you're

20

challenging?

21
22
23

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Do I understand

No, Your Honor.

The question

presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional.
One of the reasons why the injunction is

24

unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's

25

protected by the First Amendment.

All of the statements

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the

2

First Amendment.

3

malice.

4

itself is unconstitutional.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is not the requisite actual

And so it's our position that the injunction

But your question is

6

preventing all future speech about an admitted public

7

figure, and the first and third provisions of this

8

injunction do not prohibit all future speech.

9

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, that's

10

correct.

11

is based on speech that's protected by the First

12

Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is

13

that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of

14

speech.

15

It's our position, though, that the injunction

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But that isn't what you've

16

said in the question presented.

17

limited to answering the question presented?

18

would leave the other parts there.

19

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Why shouldn't we be
And that

Well, of course, you're

20

limited to the question presented.

21

is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is

22

unconstitutional.

23

injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech

24

that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by

25

the First Amendment.

Our position, though,

And one of the reasons why the

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, but you understand

2

Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine

3

that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would

4

affect the first and third parts.

5

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, Your Honor, certainly we

6

believe that the injunction is most clearly

7

unconstitutional in its overbreadth.

8

We believe also and separately the injunction is

9

unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible

10

remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public

11

officials and public figures.

12

But it's also our position that the injunction

13

is based on speech that's protected by the First

14

Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First

15

Amendment.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18
19

Well, but that doesn't -Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true

that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

We don't

20

believe our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran.

21

believe that all of his speech is just opinion.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

We

Does he intend to continue

making the same comments that he made before?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

His exact words were that

perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr.

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Cochran owes him money.

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

All right.

Now, let me ask

3

you this.

4

judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if

5

the statements are defamatory?

Under your theory, if -- if the defendant is

6

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

8

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

9

Yes, Your Honor.
What is it?
There is, of course, a remedy.

Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is

10

the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said

11

in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure.

12

is a damage judgment that's available.

13

Honor, there can't be a different rule --

14
15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

There

Certainly, Your

But if -- if the defendant is

judgment-proof, what good does that do?

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, there is a damage

17

judgment that forever would be available against the

18

person.

19

poor will have injunctions --

20

And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- well, your -- your

21

answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective

22

legal remedy under your theory of the case.

23
24
25

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, I disagree

with that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, you -- you say he has

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the remedy of -- of counter-speech.

2

that's really that doesn't answer the question.

3

question is, is there anything he can get from the courts

4

other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.

5

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

We're talking -The

That's correct, Your Honor.

6

From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't

7

accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a

8

person may be poor.

9

be collected for the person who gets assets in the future.

10
11
12
13
14

The damage remedy will be that they'd

Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it
can't be -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it -- it seems to me

that that really avoids the problem -- the problem.
So suppose we disagree with you about that.

15

Then it's true that there is no -- there is no legal

16

remedy that he can get.

17

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But then, Justice Kennedy, it

18

can't be the rule that poor people have their speech

19

enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in

20

the future.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it also can't be the rule

22

that poor people can defame ad libitum and -- and people

23

who have money cannot.

24

fair rule either.

25

I mean, that's -- that's not a

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, but that's why

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue

2

a damage judgment.

3

damage judgments can't be collected.

There are many instances in which

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

against a person who has no assets.

6

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

7

But that's true everywhere in

the legal system, Your Honor.

8
9

It's worthless against a --

And I would also argue here that none of Mr.
Tory's statements were defamatory.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would point --

Now that's another one that

11

is

12

opinion not fact.

13

your question.

14

made that these statements were defamatory, and your

15

question presented does not seem to me to encompass at

16

all the question whether these statements were defamatory.

17

in your brief.

You say that these were statements of
But that surely is not presented in

You -- you don't -- there were findings

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I would disagree, Your Honor.

18

The question presented is whether this injunction, that

19

forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment.

20

reason why --

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

One

Not -- not this injunction.

22

The question presented is whether a permanent injunction

23

as a remedy in a defamation -- in a defamation action,

24

preventing all future speech about an admitted public

25

figure, violates the First Amendment.

There's no

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular

2

case there was no defamation.

3

it's fairly included within the question.

4

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I -- I just don't think

Your Honor, what I am saying

5

is that the question presented does ask whether this

6

injunction, which permanently restricts speech --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, it doesn't.

It says

8

whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation

9

action preventing all future speech about an admitted

10

public figure violates the First Amendment.

11

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We would argue -There's nothing about this

13

particular injunction which is based upon speech that is

14

not defamation.

15

There's nothing in there about that.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, our position is

16

that question asks whether an injunction violates the

17

First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case.

18

our position is that all of the speech that was expressed

19

in this case is opinion.

20
21
22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

And it's important -All right.

Now, if that's

so -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well -- well, there really --

23

there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer

24

is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell

25

us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

should just proceed on -- on some other basis for this

2

argument.

3

We have other questions to discuss.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Sure.

But, Your Honor, I want

4

to just respond to that.

5

and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the

6

joint appendix.

7

Can a lawyer go to heaven?

8

Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that

9

charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion.

The exact statement there was --

Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief.
Luke 11:46.

Your Honor, this

10

In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling

11

somebody a traitor is opinion.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

That -- that --

13

what you've quoted many -- much of this I wouldn't repeat

14

in polite company.

15

and in fact there are two findings.

16

defamation.

17

tort of invasion of privacy.

18

first, that this was done intentionally to create a

19

negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is

20

not a matter of speech-related issues.

21

use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading

22

communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce

23

payment of money in tribute for -- for desisting from that

24

type of activity.

25

findings against you.

You've reported one of the most mild,
One, this is not just

It was an action for defamation, as well as a

All right.

And there is a finding,

It is simply the

Now, those are the

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that

2

that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by

3

the First Amendment.

4

words, you convince me of that.

5

to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I

6

was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a

7

boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in

8

-- with methods similar to this one.

9

transpose those two cases which are both on my mind.

10

All right?

Now, suppose, in other
Now, I want to know how

See, it's easy to

And I want to know if in your opinion that these

11

restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of

12

thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a

13

way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on

14

what theory.

15

say is it absolute.

16

And what I'm trying to get you to do is to
Are there limits?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

If so, what?

I would suggest three

17

different ways in which you could write the opinion that

18

distinguished the case.

19

The first is that this injunction is vastly

20

overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say

21

that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say

22

anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I

23

can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the

24

First Amendment.

25

A second way of distinguishing is that

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was

2

adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to

3

prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not

4

permitted in defamation actions.

5

than a harassment action.

That's quite different

6

And third, as I've argued, what makes this

7

different is the basis for this injunction is speech

8

protected by the First Amendment.

9
10
11

With regard to the findings that you referred
to, you mentioned two.
The first is invasion of privacy.

Your Honor,

12

the only privacy claim in this case was false light

13

invasion of privacy.

14

is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false

15

light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when

16

it's based on the same fact.

California law is clear.

17

The second basis you pointed --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

When there

Mr. Chemerinsky, this

19

case comes up to us from a California appellate court.

20

Surely they know California law better than we do.

21

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, but they did

22

not base their decision on the privacy claim because

23

California law is clear that when it's false light

24

invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation

25

action, the false light claim is dismissed.

That's a

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School

2

District.

3
4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, we're not going

to debate among ourselves over what California law is.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

All I'm

6

saying is it's important to be clear about what the

7

privacy claim is.

8

there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions.

9

Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not

As I was saying to Justice Breyer,

10

the privacy claim in this case which was just about false

11

light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted

12

is treated together with defamation.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose this picketing had

14

taken place in front of his house, every day in front of

15

his house.

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, under Frisby v.

17

Schultz, that would be a different situation.

18

Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

Under

Well -- well, then

20

this -- this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the

21

sky is falling and so forth, I -- I think we have to be

22

more precise here.

23

house, it would be different.

I think if it were in front of his

24

If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages,

25

it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least -- I

2

don't know California law -- says that you -- would you

3

agree that you can enjoin a trade libel --

4

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, Your Honor --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- that disparages quality of

6
7

goods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Actually, Your Honor, the vast

8

majority of cases have held that you cannot have an

9

injunction for product defamation.

And so I think while

10

that's a different and more difficult question, most

11

courts have said no even there.

12

And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never

13

be injunctions.

14

there's a very strong and heavy presumption against

15

injunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year

16

history of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld

17

an injunction as a remedy in a defamation action.

But I am saying that this Court has said

18

And, Your Honor --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, if -- if this under --

20

the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is

21

essentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this --

22

your client wants tribute to go away.

23

but it's defamation.

24

Therefore, damages is the only remedy.

25

And you say, yes,

It's a defamation action.

Is there nothing that one can do to stop another

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

from engaging in blackmail?

2

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, there is.

3

this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could

4

have filed a criminal complaint with the police.

5

have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion.

6

Honor, this wasn't extortion.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He could

But, Your

What kind of a jurisprudence

8

is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed

9

from an injunction?

10

If

I mean, why -- why do we do this?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But Your Honor, that's

11

because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are

12

even worse than criminal penalties.

13

Court --

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I would refer this

But -- but why -- is that true

15

in every case?

16

sure -- I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in

17

the first area, but let's -- let's assume the timid person

18

is not sure.

19

ruling first, declaratory judgment.

20

take an injunction.

21

going to jail.

22

I mean, take the timid person who's not

So he wants -- he wants to get an equitable
He -- and he would

That's certainly much easier than

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, Your Honor, I'd remind

23

you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal

24

Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior

25

restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader

16
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

than against limits on criminal penalties.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I know, but I'm asking you why

3

that -- why that should be.

4

not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse,

5

having an injunction that you can argue about or going to

6

jail, I -- I think they would say that going to jail is

7

worse.

8
9

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

If -- if you asked a person

But, Your Honor, in terms of

the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction

10

has always been regarded as worse.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Always?

Do you want to apply

12

that to an harassment action too against a woman who has

13

the restraining order?

14

cases in case they're against speech because even if

15

violence is threatened, even if -- et cetera.

16

-- how far do you want to push that principle?

17

No restraining orders in divorce

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I mean, how

Your Honor, I don't want to

18

push the principle at all to harassment.

19

injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment

20

actions.

21

thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of

2

the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed

3

out --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why can't we say that speech

5

that is -- is being used for extortion is different, just

6

as speech which is being used for harassment is different?

7

And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you

8

ought to be able to get an injunction for the former.

all speech, but only when speech is being used to -- to

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, there can be

12

an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion.

13

There was never the criminal complaint.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, this Court is

required to do an independent review of the record under

Bose v. Consumers Union.

4

Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside.

5

It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed

6

money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage

7

Mr. Cochran to pay.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Chemerinsky, the district

12

-- I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm

13

looking at page 42 of the joint appendix.

14

that these statements were actually made for the purpose

15

of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which

16

Tory was not entitled.

17

finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to

18

cease picketing unless he was paid money -- a monetary

19

settlement by Cochran.

20

simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to

21

coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in

tribute for desisting from that type of activity.

23

those sound like findings.

25

That's one finding.

The first is

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, Your Honor, since this is

a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules

Well, so this finding -- the

Was there an objection to the

testimony that established this?

15

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Tory,

16

who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very

17

outset objected that he was being held liable for speech

18

protected by the First Amendment.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but it seems to me -- and I

20

think what bothers me is -- is what bothers Justice

21

Kennedy.

22

is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the

23

findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were

24

irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten --

25

that the court should not have gotten into extortion and

It seems to me that the argument you just made

so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion,

2

quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate

3

remedy, constitutional or otherwise.

4

to me, is -- is something that we -- we are not here to

5

touch.

6

And that, it seems

That's a question of California law.
What we are here to touch is, number one,

7

whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure

8

speech, and maybe we are here -- that we have a question

9

about the -- the breadth of the case we took.

But maybe

10

we are here to determine whether there can be an

11

injunction against blackmail or harassing activities.

12

But I -- I think we're not here to decide

13

whether California could have gotten to the question of

14

blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that.

15

agree with that?

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

Do you

I certainly

17

agree with the first point.

18

is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is

19

in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and

20

whose regulated.

21

One issue before this Court

But as to the second point that you make, this

22

is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this

23

Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is

24

whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a

25

defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public

injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure

5

and simple.

has read and part of the order in question here seems to

7

go beyond pure defamation.

8

demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have

9

been in aid of extortion.

10
11

But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has --

It goes to the kind of

And that, it seems to me, is an

entirely different question.
We may -- I'm not saying we will, but we may

12

agree with you that it's overbroad.

13

that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it.

14

doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this

15

injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant

16

as to whether the -- the State of -- the courts of

17

California should have reached extortion.

18

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

We may agree with you
But that

I would disagree in this way,

Your Honor.

20

it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate

court has to do an independent review of the record.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

But, Your Honor, it was not

treated here as an action for extortion or harassment --

let me put the question this way.

8

not have a civil action for extortion.

9

criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion.

Suppose a State does
It provides
Why

10

does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that

11

State at least, a civil action for defamation which has

12

within it elements of distortion differently from pure

13

defamation?

14

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, I would say the

15

history of the First Amendment is different.

16

create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of

17

this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in

18

defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any

19

defamation case, somebody might plead something about

20

extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be

21

the norm.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

A State can

2

from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's

office?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, because the

law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy

have for that proposition?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

What's the best authority you

11

injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation

to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's

21

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Well, again, as I said to

judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that

authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has

If we restricted the injunction to

10

specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie

11

Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief,

12

the response will be that he'll come up with five new

13

words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting --

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, maybe there are

15

different grades of specificity.

16

precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways

17

to draft it that say no picketing.

MR. COLE:

Maybe it doesn't meet

Well, there could be no picketing for

purposes of -- no -- which contains defamatory speech for

20

purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran.

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But --

All I'm suggesting is just

22

draft it -- just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2

23

would not necessarily solve the problem completely.

24

Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or

25

Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.

MR. COLE:

Well, I would disagree based upon the

2

prior -- continuing course of -- of repetitive conduct and

3

the fact that this -- over a period 3 years, once a week,

4

this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr.

5

Cochran at his law office.

6

doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles

7

Superior Court.

9

When we enjoined him from

And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a
public figure actually favors the breadth of this

10

injunction.

11

public forum issue would not be as effective.

12

Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets

13

protection is in the public forum because this gentleman

14

could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica

15

Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public

16

figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation.

17

that is the problem we were contending with in attempting

18

to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet

19

could control Mr. Tory --

20

If this was not a public figure, then the

just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored.

2

I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test

3

we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this

4

-- there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in

the least restrictive means.

6

And

I also continue to advance the argument that

It's the use
This -- this
The

12

we can craft --

13

If that is not protected, then I believe

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

You can -- you can

14

certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in

connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll

16

shoot you.

17

other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and

18

saying give me something.

which gets into free speech here.

20

But that -- this was a far cry from that.

MR. COLE:

In

It's denouncing the victim,

It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist.

21

But what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr.

22

Cochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions

23

other than to draft the injunction in a form that would

24

preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct

25

without regard to whether it was -- and to let him know

could not say.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

isn't limited to the same conduct.

MR. COLE:

But the injunction

But I don't think it needs to be

because of the pattern and practice that this man has

7

engaged in over 3 years.

9

And if we take the example, which is so he has a
change of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr.

10

Cochran and that's become his -- and he's going to promote

11

him as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into

12

the court and modify the injunction.

21

letter brief, there's -- California doesn't adopt the

22

Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one,

and two, in the -- in the more unlikely event that someone

3

was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging

the State of California because the collateral bar rule

has no impact.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What you're saying is that the injunction -- we're

MR. COLE:

Justice Kennedy, all

MR. COLE:

All I'm -- all I'm saying is that if

California does not adopt that rule.

from other citizens because he's at -- he's at risk of a

I don't dispute that.
I mean, his speech is being

chilled with -- with respect to protected speech.

MR. COLE:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But there's nothing unusual -So the collateral bar rule

8

doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt

citation.

10

MR. COLE:

He's subject to it, but there's a

11

check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the

12

potential remedy for Mr. Cochran -- what -- what is going

13

to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs?

14

balance that against the -- the breadth of this

15

injunction, I think we have to look at -- one of the

16

biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in

17

terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if we

I

19

mean, it's virtually no burden.

20

saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart

21

is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting

22

he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me

23

$10,000.

24

that's what it's aimed at.

Then I'll stop.

JUSTICE BREYER:

it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a

defense.

It would violate the First Amendment.

have to do it?

doesn't apply outside of it.

MR. COLE:

It's so easy.

10

Justice Breyer.

I agree that was the whole purpose for

11

the injunction.

That's the basis of the injunction.

12

you could always remand for further proceedings,

13

consistent with any opinion you would write, that the

14

injunction has to be tailored to -- to deal with

15

defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with

16

the intent to extort.

19

And I --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what he's arguing.

You're -- you're conceding that it's overbroad.
MR. COLE:

I'm saying if this Court -- well, I'm

20

gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's

21

overbroad.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. COLE:

25

And

Ah, you're very perceptive.

And having gleaned that perception,

I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on

2

paragraph 2.

indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First

4

Amendment issues.

5

And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have

And I think it's important to point out that if

6

we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in

7

this day -- modern age --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

opposite of what your opponent said.

10

You're sort of saying the

has it ever been there?

11

MR. COLE:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

MR. COLE:

It's never been there.
What are we taking away?

I -- I agree it's never -- you've

14

never found it there and you've never said it can't be

15

there.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

How does California work in

17

that respect?

18

mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of

19

State law boxes, that California seems to have an action.

20

Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words.

21

what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind.

22

It's defamation accompanied by extortion.

23

have defamation accompanied by extortion -- call it

24

whatever you want -- an injunction is proper in these

25

circumstances.

Because what I've been thinking of in my

2

not talking about all defamation actions?

about this beast in California which uses the word

defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues

-- also finds extortion and therefore issues an

6

injunction.

MR. COLE:

We are talking

Yes, I think that you could limit the

8

injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature

designed to extort.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would -- would that make Mr.

Cochran happy?

lot of money.

16

think Mr. Cochran would be any -- any happier simply

17

because the guy says I'll -- hasn't said I'll stop if you

pay me $10,000?

19

What -- what's the big deal about

I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in

He just pickets every day and says Cochran

MR. COLE:

Do you

No, and I think that would be subject

20

to the same injunctive relief.

21

unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree,

22

Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says

23

injunctions in defamation actions would be improper.

24

think people would start defaming with impunity.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think this case is

You've got to give us some

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

line.

2

extortion is that -- that there's reluctance to say you

3

can issue injunctions in all defamation actions.

4

what -- what limitation do you want to place upon the

5

ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation

6

combined with extortion?

I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto

7

MR. COLE:

Now,

I don't think you need to place a

8

limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory

9

conduct.

Take, for example, the Internet.

A posting goes

10

on of a -- of a business that -- a startup company.

11

can't -- damages of -- for a startup company -- they're

12

very difficult to prove.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

But then you run into the

public figure.

of rule of law, isn't it?

action against a public figure, which they want to say

17

this is.

You can write all kinds of things about public

18

figures.

People can and do, for better or for worse.

19

-- is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation

20

action an injunction?

21
22
23

I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind

MR. COLE:

I mean, a pure defamation

Do

There's no authority, but there's no

authority that says you can't do it.
But what I am suggesting is in -- is in a pure

24

defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful

25

conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin.

For

44
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory

2

on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only

3

way to get that posting off the Internet would be to

4

enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the

5

problem.

6

you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting,

7

similar to -- to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed

8

a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude

9

it.

10

And if it's -- even if it's purely defamatory,

There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it

in the future.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you've just said

12

something that I think that's inconsistent with your

13

earlier presentation.

14

posting.

15

enjoin the particular placards that were used, the

16

particular words because then there would be other words.

17

So the same question could come up with an Internet

18

posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was

19

posted but anything about this particular individual that

20

might be posted in the future.

21

You said you could enjoin that

Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to

MR. COLE:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where

22

that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of

23

balancing about the -- how narrowly tailored the

24

injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and,

25

you know -- and -- and in this -- and what test we would

45
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny,

2

or the Ward test.

3

those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the

4

balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific

5

type of speech or -- then that -- that would be a -- a

6

reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of

7

actions, well, so be it.

8

for that posting or postings of a similar nature.

And -- and I think that in applying

But at least there's a remedy

conduct, one.

12

also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the

14

is speech designed for an improper purpose.

Cochran.

It's

That was the whole theme -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does California law require

6

MR. COLE:

Notice pleading based on facts, but

7

we do label the causes of action.

8

trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled,

9

if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge

The -- the point I'm

10

implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is

11

not protected.

12

correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified

13

cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were

14

seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from

15

defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money.

16

And whether we named the cause of action

We attempted to achieve that.

We thought we did

17

a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack

18

and I agree is not fairly included within the question

19

which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the

20

underlying finding.

21

But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I

22

agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr.

23

Tory other channels of communication other than the public

forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of

25

repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran.

suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

2

Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about

Thank you.

how an opinion might be written, and there are three

different ways not mutually exclusive.

5

One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad

6

for all the reasons that have been identified.

7

said a couple of things.

8

go to court and ask for modification of the injunction,

9

but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr.

10

Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets

11

permission.

12

Mr. Cole

One, he said that Mr. Tory can

Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go

13

before the media.

14

Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public

15

forum.

However, under California law, under

16

A second way the opinion could be written is

17

that this for speech protected by the First Amendment.

18

Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether

19

that's in the scope of the question presented.

20

is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying.

21

it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the

22

First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion

23

claim.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it
Because

Yes, but you're asking us now

to -- the -- the trial court found there was defamation,

was mere opinion.

in the question presented.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

5

It

I really don't see how that's included

I think it is because it goes

to the question whether the injunction is permissible.

6

But I go on to the third way that the opinion

7

could be written, and that's that injunctions are not

8

permissible as a remedy in a defamation case.

9

that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can

We agree

10

have an injunction as a remedy.

11

action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a

12

remedy.

14

We agree if the cause of

But those have specific elements that have to be

Those elements weren't met in this case.
History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed

15

in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite

16

important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow

17

injunction in a defamation case.

18

too narrow or too broad.

19

Any injunction is either

In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it

was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First

21

Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by

22

this Court in a defamation case.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No --

There have been -- there have

stalking.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, and we have

no objection to injunctions of that sort.

an injunction that is directed at speech.
