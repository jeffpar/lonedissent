ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

We'll now hear argument in the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:

10

At issue in this case is the safety of police

11

officers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in

12

an inherently unsafe situation.

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

May I ask one preliminary

14

question, Mr. Phillips?

15

question at all about qualified immunity?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Do we have before us here any

Well, we do believe that a

17

qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying

18

merits.

19

because --

20
21

It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
the questions --

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

But it wasn't -- it wasn't in

This Court --- on which we granted cert?

This Court in Procunier treated

the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

underlying merits of the case and -- and, in fact, skipped

2

over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address

3

the qualified immunity issue.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

And presumably --

How -- how --- the Court could do the same

thing here.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do we do it?

It goes right

8

to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity

9

thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and

10

circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close

11

question as to whether the police did or did not exceed

12

the reasonable bounds -- reasonable bounds.

13

Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury

14

verdict against you, and -- and then I think, well, yes,

15

but I begin to come -- become disturbed if I think of

16

qualified immunity.

17

so having read through the thing, I -- I preliminarily

18

start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive

19

force, I mean, given -- you know, I'm using that in

20

quotes.

I mean, it isn't that clear.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

So --

Right.
The jury said it was.

Who am I

to say it wasn't --

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I mean, this -- this --- in that situation?

But

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

qualified immunity.

2

So now, what do I do?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, in the first instance, it's

3

reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's

4

determination here.

5
6

This Court has already --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

We -- don't we have to give

any weight at all to the jury finding there or --

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

With respect to the historical

8

facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you

9

have -- that -- that's subject to clearly erroneous

10

review.

11

issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at

12

least a mixed issue of fact --

13
14
15
16
17

On the issue of whether or not the conduct at

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, a lot of it may depend on

the -MR. PHILLIPS:

-- and law that this Court has

decided as de novo.
JUSTICE BREYER:

-- on the music as to

18

handcuffing and what did they say and what was the

19

atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how

20

risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses

21

and -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from

22

the testimony.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

It -- it seems to me that --

24

Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions

25

go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard

2

that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in

3

Michigan v. Summers.

4

And that's a question of law.

To be sure, there are lots of elements of it,

5

but what my position would be -- and obviously the

6

officers' position in this case -- is that in exercising

7

unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as

8

you've just described them and none of that is excessive

9

because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than

10

what is necessary in order to achieve complete control

11

under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection

12

of the individual officers and -- and candidly of the

13

other individuals who were being -- being detained, all

14

four of them, under these circumstances.

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

16

initial question?

17

qualified immunity?

18

Have you responded to my

Have you said all you want to say about

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Justice O'Connor.

My -- my

19

basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed

20

that issue in Procunier.

21

immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even

22

though it hadn't been presented in the question presented,

23

and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a -- a

24

stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case

25

because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit

It considered that the qualified

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

specifically addressed the issue.

2

Saucier.

3

was appropriate and -- and did the two-part test, the

4

first part being whether it was a constitutional violation

5

and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under

6

these particular circumstances.

7

It looked at under

It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity

So if I -- if I cannot persuade you that this is

8

constitutional, which obviously I -- I hope I can do, it

9

seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there -- that

10

what the officers did here under these circumstances were

11

perfectly reasonable.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

the function of a jury in this case?

14

15

verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z.

16

the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we

17

know from the jury verdict.

18

Well, what is the -- what is
What does the jury

And the jury doesn't return a special
It finds whether

Other -- I think what you're saying is that

19

these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a

20

demurrer.

21

alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds

22

up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth

23

Amendment.

24
25

You assume all the facts as the plaintiff

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I'm not saying that that

would be true in all cases.

I do think in this particular

case you did not need to have a jury verdict.

have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were

found ultimately and -- and giving the benefit of all of

the inferences to the --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We would

We don't know the fact --

6

what facts were found because all we have is in the jury

verdict that this was excessive force.

8

all.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Period.

That's

But that's just a conclusion of

10

law, Justice Ginsburg.

11

are the facts as they're described --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the -- the facts that you know

But it's like was --

-- by the respondent's brief.
-- the defendant negligent.

15

Is that more or less a conclusion of law?

16

in what respect from the jury verdict.

17

these police officers acting -- did they use excessive

18

force.

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

We don't know

And here, were

Well, we know precisely what they

20

did.

21

of the -- of the search.

22

there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her

23

physically.

24
25

They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We know that.

There's no --

Wasn't there a fact issue as

to whether she was handcuffed for -- even for a short

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

period after the search had been completed?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't think there is a factual

3

question like that because I don't think that question was

4

presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis

5

on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in

6

this case.

7

the jury that this -- that this extended beyond the -- the

8

period of the end of the search.

9

made to the jury was that the search should have -- should

10

have been limited to the room where the suspect was -- was

11

a resident or that the police should have made a decision

12

somewhere in the -- before the end of the 2-hour search

13

that she was no longer a threat to them.

14

were arguing that -- that it even went a little further in

15

terms of the timing of it.

16

to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth

17

Amendment violation in its own right.

18

There -- there was never an argument made to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The argument that was

And then they

But they never asked the jury

But if -- but if it made a

19

difference as a matter of law, what -- what should we

20

assume about that extra 15 minutes?

21

they found the facts in the way that the -- a plaintiff

22

argues them or that you think they are?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Do we assume that

I think if the jury had been

24

asked to make that finding, that you -- and -- and the

25

jury determined that there -- that it was unreasonable,

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes

2

were, in fact -- that it did, in fact, go beyond 15

3

minutes.

4

whether that's de minimis under the circumstances.

5

I do think there is still a legal issue as to

But -- but I agree.

I mean, obviously there is

6

a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them

7

a certain amount of respect.

8

reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police

9

exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean,

But on the core questions of

10

this Court has already decided that in the Fourth

11

Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a

12

matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police

13

officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a

14

particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, in doing it as a matter of

16

law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in

17

this case, if -- if I remember correctly, one of the

18

officers testified that had they followed normal protocol,

19

once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the

20

building, the -- the main building --

21
22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the -- all of the grounds

actually.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is that the whole compound?
Yes.
That -- that they would have --

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he

2

wasn't sure why they didn't.

3

consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as

4

-- as to what is or is not excessive?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

We -- do we -- do we

I think if this Court could

6

determine that, as a matter of course, the -- the standard

7

operating procedures in a particular way, that might

8

certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis.

9

That -- I think what's important to keep in mind in this

10

context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about

11

four individuals who are being detained under these

12

circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for

13

the police officers under the -- under -- when trying to

14

decide how best to proceed.

16

17

individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing.

18

One of them had been found
One of them had been

So, you know, is it possible that police

19

procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a

20

single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes

21

that he can take away -- you can remove the handcuffs?

22

That may be, although I don't think there's much in the

23

record here to -- to reflect that.

24
25

But what the police said here -- and I think
it's extraordinarily important.

Officer Muehler testified

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that if something had gone wrong, if either a police

2

officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that

3

house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a -- in the

4

context of executing the search warrant, the first

5

question that would have been asked is what was the least

6

that could have been done to prevent those injuries from

7

occurring.

8

rightly -- and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace

9

under the unquestioned command theory of -- of law -- is

And he said to himself and he said it quite

10

that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of

11

a reasonable search, we will make our way through the

12

search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order

13

to minimize the detention and we will eliminate -- and I

14

mean, literally eliminate -- the entirety of the risk

15

either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the

16

detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

I take it you obviously

18

don't want us to -- to come down with a kind of a finicky

19

version of -- of excessive force as the touchstone, and I

20

take it you don't want us to come down with simply a

21

blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do

22

anything in -- in restraining occupants so long as it is

23

not wantonly cruel.

24

-- a statement that would be the kernel of the holding

25

that you want?

Somewhere in between.

Do you have a

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm -- I'm quite comfortable with

2

the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that

3

the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the

4

intrusion to be imposed by the seizure.

5

you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the

6

ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in

7

order to --

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
were no handcuffs.

That is, you --

But in the facts there, there

He -- he was just detained.

MR. PHILLIPS:

So --

I understand that, and -- but my

11

-- my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect

12

the detention under these circumstances other than to

13

assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command

14

of the situation.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- I mean, I don't -- would

16

-- would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for -- for

17

purposes of applying Summers?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, but it's important to put

19

that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to

20

the -- not an exception.

21

the Fourth Amendment.

22

It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we

23

know that there has either been a crime that's likely to

24

be taking place in the premises.

It's a narrow circumstance under

only when the search is for contraband, not just for any

2

evidence.

3

time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find

4

evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's

5

reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and

6

anybody else who happens to be on site.

7

So, for instance, when the police go the 60th

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it doesn't -- why is

8

contraband magical?

9

when -- when the reason they're investigating gives cause

10

Wouldn't -- wouldn't your point be

to believe that there may be physical danger --

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

Justice Scalia --- from letting people wander

around?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- absolutely.
Which is the case with

16

contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons

17

as well.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

is that we're talking about guns.

20

are guns.

possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different

2

conclusion in an unusual case.

3

And the only verdict part that I think we're

4

concerned with here -- it was not about four people.

5

was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena,

6

the jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her

Fourth Amendment rights.

8

found -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke.

It

You

In looking at it,

10

I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or

11

more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond

12

the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs,

13

both after the time they had secured the place and also

after the time the search ended.

15

basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that would seem a

Well, it -- it could have been a

17

basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the

18

issue of whether or not they were detained --

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, Mr. -- Mr. -- but may I

20

point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue

21

to the jury at page 203.

22

release an individual detained in connection with a lawful

23

search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the

24

search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever

25

is sooner.

A police officer is required to

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

That -- I understand

2

that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply

3

brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record

4

and it was never argued to the jury that this search --

5

that -- that her detention lasted beyond the period of the

6

search in this case.

7

officers specifically said in his closing argument, there

8

is no issue but that she was released at the time of the

9

-- that when -- as soon as the search was -- was ended,

10

the -- the warrant was executed.

11
12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I wonder why the judge gave

this instruction then.

13
14

Indeed, counsel for the police

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because -- because what he's --

well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And why -- why there was --

16

there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one.

17

But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page

18

255 of the joint appendix --

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
One question concerns whether

21

the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find

22

that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable?

23

Those two questions -- my first is a procedural

24

question.

jury?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

We didn't.

And -- and -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it seems to me that the

5

judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is

6

whether there was a -- a detention, was force greater than

7

was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the

8

duration was longer than reasonable under the

9

circumstances.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Justice Ginsburg, you

11

have to put that in context.

12

plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have

13

ended at either of two points:

14

cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at

15

some point after that when they had asked her questions

16

and determined that she had no particular involvement with

17

Mr. Romero.

18

unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found,

19

was that that was the reasonable break point.

20

The argument of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

MR. SHANMUGAM:

1

violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable

2

restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise

3

unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate

4

the orderly completion of the search.

5

The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the

6

officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the

7

Fourth Amendment.

8

Under the standard for excessive force claims

9

first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as

10

informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers,

11

the degree of force used here was not excessive.

12

considerations that justified the detention of the

13

occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern

14

of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants

15

themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use

16

of handcuffs during the detention.

it's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for

motion was denied.

force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by

10

11

detentions.

excessive force is not a jury issue?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We would concede, I think,

Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where

18

there are disputed issues of historical fact.

question subject to de novo review, over your dissent,

admittedly.

7

the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that

officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive

guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

only basis on -- on which the jury could have ruled for

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We believe that that certainly

is the primary issue that was at stake.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in fact --

that.

we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you

I think that that's true, but I

10

think that the instruction didn't really provide any

11

guidance on excessive force specifically.

12

an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the

13

detention more generally, rather than with regard to

14

excessive force specifically.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It was really

It was not a Graham v.

17

was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying

instruction and to bring this -- the denial of that

19

instruction here.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, there were objections to

21

the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps

22

an argument could be made -- and perhaps Mr. Phillips will

23

make the argument on rebuttal -- that it is fairly

24

included within the questions presented.

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

you can say that the only thing that was before the jury

2

was the handcuff when the -- there was evidence that she

3

was treated very roughly in -- in the first instance, she

was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were

That doesn't drop out of the case and what the

other issues.

those -- and I would add that those are the two factors on

13

which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's

verdict.

15

initial use of force and with regard to the continued use

16

of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support

17

the officers' use of force in both instances.

I think that the other relevant use of

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9

All right.
-- with regard to a challenge to

the manner of the detention itself.

In that instance,

10

then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I

11

think even then the teaching of Ornelas --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then it's not a question of

law.

14

degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of

MR. SHANMUGAM:

ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

So this instruction should not

That's correct -I thought your position was

that it -- it may be submitted to the jury, but that it

10

may be reviewed as a question of law simply because that's

11

the way we are able to set standards for later cases.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that's exactly right,

13

and I think that that is the teaching of Ornelas.

14

may very well be that a more specific instruction should

15

have been given so as to make clear that the jury had

16

specific issues of historical fact to resolve.

17

ultimately we do believe that it's a question of law in

18

the sense that it should be reviewed de novo for precisely

19

the reasons given in Ornelas.

20

And it

But

And if I could just say a couple words on the

21

substantive issue of excessive force.

22

cases involving violent crimes, officers should routinely

23

be allowed to use handcuffs.

24

add that there were several additional case-specific

25

factors that justified the use of handcuffs.

Alderson Reporting Company

to the fact that this was a violent crime, the officers

2

had reason to believe that at least one and possibly two

3

members of a violent gang were living at the house.

4

addition, the officers had previously visited the house on

5

two occasions to investigate other violent crimes and had

6

encountered resistance on at least one of those occasions.

7

In

And our fundamental problem with the Ninth

8

Circuit's rule is that it seems to suggest that officers

9

in the course of a detention should really stop and

10

investigate whether or not each -- each individual that

11

they encounter poses a safety threat.

12

that rule is as unworkable as it is unwise.

13

effectively divert officers from the primary task at hand

14

and could perversely have the effect of prolonging rather

15

than expediting the completion of the search.

16

that reason, we believe that the Ninth Circuit's rule, its

17

substantive constitutional rule, was erroneous.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And we believe that
It would

that it lasted 90 minutes.

the special verdict asked the jury to find whether Ms.

Mena had been kept beyond the time that the search ended.

In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was

consistent with prior testimony by the videographer

15

herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at

16

trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted.

17

The -- the point being -- and if you take the

18

distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer

19

Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was -- was kept in handcuffs

20

at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a

21

period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't

22

even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account.

23

24

there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of

20

that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and

21

that he also visited his -- his mother from time to time.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They had

Then that would make it even

23

more curious if the place where the dangerous man was

24

wasn't searched extensively and -- and the mother --

25

nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this -- they knew

pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, they knew right away.
Yes.

And that's, I guess,

4

your -- your point, that the place where the dangerous man

5

was is not --

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think that that explains one of

7

the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here

8

because they -- they knew that at 8:45, at the time that

9

Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the

10

officers were out of the house and -- and everything was

11

done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana

12

possession.

13

sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe

14

longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted

15

garage with her hands behind her back.

16

And at the same time, from 8:45 until

JUSTICE BREYER:

You might be able to keep your

17

verdict, I -- I think.

18

the Ninth Circuit -- you go to the Ninth Circuit and you

19

say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's

20

definition for reasons that you say.

21

Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the

22

Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give

23

some reasons.

24

half pages written the reason that this was

25

unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about

But I think the problem here is

And -- and the Ninth

And two of those reasons are, A, four and a

her immigration status, which you -- I don't think you

2

even raised.

3

the bulk of the -- of -- of -- that's the bulk of the

4

analysis.

5

Maybe you did.

But anyway, that's -- that's

And -- and these are the words that I think

6

they're objecting to.

7

reasonableness, Mena was -- the -- the officers should

8

have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear

9

that she posed no immediate threat.

And by any standard of

And that was long

10

before the -- the -- because she wasn't a threat.

11

that was long before the end of the search.

12

And

And what their point is on that is, you know, if

13

that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT

14

teams because they can't operate that way.

15

can't evaluate the individual.

16

if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a

17

gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there

18

for the search for a couple of hours, then they release

19

her.

20

They -- they

They put the individual --

Now, that's their argument.
So they're objecting not so much to -- to the

21

fact they have to pay $30,000 -- or they may object to

22

that.

23

the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I

24

guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again,

25

though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way

But they're -- they're objecting to the holding of

not to do it.

But -- but I want to know your view of what I

3

see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's

4

analysis was wrong.

5

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

I mean, first of all, I'd --

6

I'd say that the -- the Court could affirm the judgment in

7

this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that

8

we --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:
reach the issue.

Yes, but then we can't really

That's a possibility.

MR. HOFFMAN:

I see that.

And in fact -- and I -- I think

that would be the appropriate thing to do.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but then suppose that the

14

reason that this case is here is because of the

implications --

-- not necessarily the extra 30

minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.
MR. HOFFMAN:

I think -- I think that there -- I

23

would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two

24

parts really.

25

that that -- that was not an issue that was presented to

On the questioning issue, I would just say

violation.

4

It wasn't.

And we didn't argue it in the

What we did -- we did say in our -- in our brief

5

to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her

6

immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to --

7

to Summers detention.

8
9
10
11

We did say that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, we could say is their

opinion -- that's their opinion.

It's beside the point,

et cetera.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

So, I mean, I -- I think

12

on questioning, you know, we -- we haven't been pushing

13

that issue.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if two of the reasons

15

that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why

16

wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without

17

-- to make the judgment without taking those two factors

18

into account?

19

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think what -- first of

20

all, it's a separate alternative holding.

21

is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation

22

while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on.

23

The jury found that she had been detained longer than was

24

reasonable and with more force than was reasonable.

25

is a jury verdict.

What they said

This

The Ninth Circuit affirmed that.

37
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

And we've argued in our brief that if the Court

2

did something on questioning, it would really be issuing

3

an advisory opinion in this -- in this situation.

4

you know, we've -- we've argued the point and we're

5

prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that

6

question because it's obviously an important question.

7

our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the

8

more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't

9

question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited

And,

10

purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that

11

that's contested.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

In

Well -I don't --- well, it does seem to me

that --

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Excuse me.
It -- it does seem -- seem to

18

me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on --

19

on this key point of when she had to be released.

20

officers should have released her when it became clear she

21

posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

its holding.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that implies that they

2

have a -- a duty at the outset to determine whether --

3

what her status is rather than to go around looking for

4

guns and -- and to secure the premises.

5

one of my concerns with that.

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's -- that's

Well, I would have a different

7

position on that.

8

can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of

9

this issue because it was a -- a jury verdict and -- and

First of all, I think that the judgment

10

the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question

11

5 or 6.

12
13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The -- the first ground being?

Just an unreasonably long -MR. HOFFMAN:

15

of the search.

16

can be affirmed on that ground.

17

And so I think technically the judgment

But with respect to the handcuffing, the

18

position that we would say is that, first of all, you --

19

you would have to view the facts in the light most

20

favorable to the verdict.

21

a lot of questioning about what that means and what the

22

jury's role is.

23

to this decision, which we assume the Court would do --

24

and that is, that you would first have to take the light

25

-- all the facts in the light most favorable to the

Now, it's been -- there's been

verdict, including the possibility that the -- the jury

2

rejected as being incredible the statements that the

3

officers made in terms of justification, if there was

4

evidence in the record to show that there was

5

contradicting evidence, which there is in this record.

6

And so the facts that -- that the other side has tried to

7

argue are the facts on which you would make that

constitutional decision are not the facts in the light

10

In the light most favorable to the verdict,

there was -- there was lots of planning.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

court level, the -- the district court heard a rule 59.

2

But one of the things about this case is it was tried

3

right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and

4

in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got

5

to decide qualified immunity.

6

actually.

7

the proper standard of qualified immunity had been

8

applied.

9

This was June 2001

And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether

The district judge, looking at the facts, found

10

that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including

11

evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the

12

search.

13

the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's

14

published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of

15

these issues.

16

The district judge found that.

And then in -- in

And basically the -- the qualified immunity --

17

on the -- on the over-detention claim, I think they've

18

conceded that there just isn't any justification for -- I

19

mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes.

20

I mean, that -- this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is

21

too long on a -- on a Terry stop when there's actually

22

reasonable suspicion.

Here, there's nothing to hold her.

23

With respect to the handcuffing issue --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. HOFFMAN:

Is it clear that it was 30?

Well, I think in viewing the light

45
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to

2

assume that -- that the jury could have found an hour.

3

But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own

4

testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the

5

verdict, it's at least 27 to 32.

6

something that just could not possibly be considered de

7

minimis under any kind of exception.

8
9
10
11

And so you've got

And -- and that's why they fought it on the
facts.

They haven't even made an argument on the law at

any point in this.
And with respect to handcuffing, I think our

12

position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all,

13

doesn't deal with handcuffing.

14

consistently tried to equate detention with restraint.

15

And I think what -- what Summers indicated was that this

16

Court was willing to allow people to be detained during

17

the course of a search for three specific reasons.

18

when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the

19

justifications, this Court specifically said it was

20

endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be

21

very much different asking someone to sit around --

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the other side has

And

Doesn't that just go to the

point that it's not clearly established at least?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, no.

I -- I don't think that

is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in -- in -- Summers

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

2

about having to justify force based on a -- on a Fourth

Amendment analysis.

4

Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the

5

Court, first of all, used the -- the analysis that we have

6

argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to

7

decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out

8

in an unreasonable manner.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- unclothed, et cetera -I -- I understand that the

14

facts were more egregious, but the -- the Court's analysis

15

for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity

16

standpoint -- for a reasonable officer reading that

17

opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think.

18

is that the proper analysis to determine whether

19

handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is -- is

20

allowed has to be decided under the kinds of

21

justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham

22

analysis when it comes to force.

23

cases that -- that allow officers to do that.

24

lower court cases.

25

court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out

The second thing, the -- the point about the

particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those

were additional factors, not the line.

7

didn't say that the constitutional standard was

9

traditional Fourth Amendment analysis.

10

The Ninth Circuit

It -- it applied

And finally and I think very important and not

11

dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is

12

that the Ninth Circuit in -- in Franklin rejected a

13

blanket handcuffing policy.

14

Portland.

15

that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search

16

is over.

17

kind of policy because Summers and -- and Graham require

18

it to be individualized justification for that -- for an

19

additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's

20

allowed in Summers.

21

That's what the policy was in

The Portland police department had a policy

And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that

And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of

22

its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing

that.

-- I would like to -- if we were reaching that, I would

20

argue that the Ninth Circuit -- that -- that there is --

21

there should be a limit on questioning in a -- in a

22

Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of

23

Terry analysis that the majority of the -- the circuits

24

apply.

I mean, I would -- on the merits of the question, I

thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that

and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word,

disingenuous when it talked about a garage?

and she was --

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

She wasn't standing by a grease

11

rack, but she was made to sit initially by an open door

12

because the door had basically been obliterated on a very

13

cold, rainy February morning where she was very cold, and

14

after -- and had been taken through the -- the pouring

15

rain in bare feet and with only a T-shirt and was left

16

there for at least 20 or so minutes without being given a

coat or shoes.

unnecessary.

2

in the Ninth Circuit certainly under Franklin that the

3

manner of a search that was unnecessarily prolonged or

4

painful or an unnecessary invasion of privacy was clearly

5

established law in the Ninth Circuit as of 1994.

6

And that -- that was clearly established law

I think in the Heitschmidt case, which is very

7

similar in a lot of ways to our case, that came out after

8

the search, but applied the same reasoning to a 1994

9

search.

You had the same kind of handcuffing of a non-

10

suspect as to whom the -- the officers didn't have that --

11

that kind of -- of suspicion.

12

that that was a violation and denied qualified immunity to

13

the officers.

And the Fifth Circuit found

14

So from our standpoint, on the issue of being

15

detained past the time, I think it's just a clear case.

16

think the other side has conceded that if -- if there's

17

this evidence in the record, which there is, the judgment

18

has to be affirmed on that basis.

I

19

On -- on the handcuffing issue, we believe the

20

same principle has to apply because the facts have to be

21

viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, and

22

when you view those facts, I -- it -- it is -- no

23

reasonable officer would believe you could do those things

24

to Ms. Mena in these circumstances based on the law at the

25

time.

MR. PHILLIPS:

that Justices Breyer and Kennedy raised, which is what do

18

you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit is wrong, that

19

the questioning here violated the Fourth Amendment, and

what do you do when you know that the Ninth Circuit was

21

wrong in saying that the officers have an affirmative duty

22

in the middle of a Summers detention to make an assessment

23

on an individualized basis as to the risks posed by any

24

individual detainee.

25

you are plainly erroneous and warrant reversal on that

2

At that stage, if the respondent wants to argue

3

to the Ninth Circuit that that 15 minutes is, in fact,

4

proved by the facts of this case, that's fine, but

5

understand, those issues were put to the Ninth Circuit,

and the Ninth Circuit did not affirm on the alternative

was based on the jury's determination that we had detained

her beyond the period we had done the sweep.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if the district court got

it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why
