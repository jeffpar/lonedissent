ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SALMONS:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:

11

Section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code

12

defines gross income to include all income from whatever

13

source derived.

14

is sweeping and represents an intent by Congress to exert

15

the full measure of its taxing power.

16

As this Court has held, that definition

The court of appeals decisions below, by

17

excluding from respondent's gross income the portion of

18

litigation proceeds paid to their attorneys under

19

contingent fee agreements, is inconsistent with two

20

longstanding Federal tax law principles for defining gross

21

income.

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, if -- if this didn't

23

involve the alternative minimum tax, would the amount be

24

deductible?

25

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, but for the

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

alternative minimum tax, there would be an -- a

2

miscellaneous itemized deduction --

3
4

MR. SALMONS:

-- under section 212 of the

MR. SALMONS:

-- that would be subject to the

code --

5
6

limit of the 2 percent of adjusted gross income that

7

applies to itemized deductions.

8

56(b)(1)(A) --

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
Right?

That's of annual income.

2 percent of -- of the person's annual income?

11

MR. SALMONS:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. SALMONS:

14

But section

Of the adjusted gross income.
For the year.

For the year.

That's correct,

Your Honor.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, gee, in the case of a --

16

of a major award, that 2 percent is very likely to be

17

exceeded, isn't it?

18
19
20

MR. SALMONS:

It -- it certainly may, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So this is a problem that's

21

going to exist even -- even after the alternate minimum

22

tax is abolished.

Right?

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. SALMONS:

25

I'm not sure entirely what you're

referring to as the problem, but it is the case that --

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

that --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you don't think -- the

3

Government doesn't think it's a problem.

4

about taking a huge percentage of the -- of the person's

5

recovery.

6

case where there's no minimum tax -- alternative.

7

That -- that will happen even -- even in the

MR. SALMONS:

8

correct, Your Honor.

9

points about that.

10

I'm talking

That is correct.

That -- that is

Now, I mean -- and let me make two

The first is that as a -- as a general matter,

11

the tax code defines gross income expansively, and there's

12

a number of this Court's cases that make that clear.

13

-- then the question becomes are there deductions provided

14

that allow for certain expenses to be deducted.

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Then

Don't some States such as

16

Oregon require a plaintiff to remit a portion of punitive

17

damages recovered to the State so they don't even go to

18

the taxpayer?

19

But is the taxpayer saddled with that too?

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, I would think the

20

answer to that question is no.

21

have examined in depth in -- in this case because it's not

22

presented, but as a general matter --

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It's not a question that I

Well, what about attorney's

24

fees in class actions?

25

regarded by the Government as attributable all to the

As I understand it, those are not

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

taxpayer.

2

MR. SALMONS:

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Your Honor -A plaintiff who's part of a

4

class in a class action suit where attorney's fees are

5

paid.

6

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, we believe that the

7

same principles would apply to class action lawsuits as to

8

other lawsuits in terms of the taxation of litigation

9

proceeds.

It may very well be the case in a number of

10

class action contexts that when applying those principles,

11

the proper -- the proper analysis leads to the conclusion

12

that the taxpayer doesn't exert sufficient control and

13

that the payment of attorney's fees is not in response to

14

a debt owed by the taxpayer.

15

different result.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And so there might be a

Well, I -- I thought we were

17

-- our attention was pointed to a number of instances

18

where the Internal Revenue Service did not require the

19

taxpayer to show all the attorney's fees as income in

20

those class action situations.

21

MR. SALMONS:

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

23

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, that is correct.
Yes.

I want to be clear.

We think the

24

same principles apply across the board to defining gross

25

income.

In applying that in a number of class action

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

contexts, the proper answer may be that it's not included

2

in gross income because there wasn't sufficient control

3

and because it wasn't paid in -- in lieu of a debt owed by

4

the taxpayer.

5

But here --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why isn't there as much

6

control in each case?

7

lawyer with a claim and says, press the claim for me,

8

recover if you can.

9

of control?

I mean, the -- somebody goes to a

What's the difference in -- in terms

So that if you win this case, why doesn't it

10

apply to class action?

11

MR. SALMONS:

12

Again, the principles would apply

and there may very well be class actions --

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

why the result would be different.

15

MR. SALMONS:

Yes, and I -- I want to know

Again, I'm -- I'm trying to be as

16

specific as I can.

17

in the class action context, there's a fee agreement

18

between the -- the class member and the lawyer so that the

19

payment of attorney's fees is in satisfaction of a debt

20

owed by the class member, and in that situation we think

21

that it would be --

22

There may be situations in which, even

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why would -- why would

23

that analysis appear?

24

going to be any fee paid in the -- in the paradigm example

25

of the class action without a recovery.

Certainly there's -- there's not

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SALMONS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

2

-- there are situations --

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4
5

So we're in the -- so we're in

the situation we're in right now, aren't we?
MR. SALMONS:

We are in the situation in which

6

there's a need to apply the general principles for

7

defining gross income.

8
9

There

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

But let me just --

I'll just press the point one more time.

I don't

10

understand, based on what you've said, why the class

11

action result would be different from the result that

12

you're arguing for here if you win this case.

13

MR. SALMONS:

And -- and what I'm trying to

14

point out, Your Honor, is that there may very well be

15

class actions where it's not different.

16

when -- where it is if it's the case that there's no

17

contractual obligations to pay the fee -- pay the fee

18

between the class member and the attorney, and if it's the

19

case that the class member really exerts no meaningful

20

control over the -- over the attorney's fees portion --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

There may be some

I thought the class action

22

distinction that the commissioner had was between opt in

23

and opt out.

24
25

MR. SALMONS:

That is certainly one of the

factors that -- that the commissioner has looked to in

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

those class --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

So if you opt in, then you did

3

exercise control.

4

opt out, you didn't have control over the suit because you

5

didn't opt out.

So all the money is yours.

But if you

I mean, you just were lethargic.

6

MR. SALMONS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Again, those are all facts -That's the basic thing.

I

8

mean, I'm trying to understand what the principle is for

9

the reason that it's pretty hard for me to reconcile the

10

commissioner's view in the class action case with the

11

punitive damage case because there the person has control

12

over the lawsuit.

13

attorney's fees that come out of that, and so forth belong

14

to -- in other words, it sounds to me, as I read this,

15

something of a mess, and I'd like to know what the clear

16

principle is.

17

So why doesn't all the punitive damage,

MR. SALMONS:

Yes, Your Honor.

And -- and just

18

to be clear, I -- I don't think the commissioner has ever

19

taken the position that all class actions don't present

20

the -- the possibility of the attorney's fees portion of

21

the award being included in -- in the class member's gross

22

income.

23

Now, there are real enforcement issues, as a

24

practical matter, to trying to -- to trying to implement

25

that.

You can imagine a number of class actions --

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you say the class

2

member, do you -- you mean the named representative.

3

class may include thousands of people, but it would be

4

income to the named representative?

5

MR. SALMONS:

The

Is that --

Well, presumably, Your Honor, that

6

-- only the portion of the attorney's fees that would be

7

attributable to the -- the named representative's recovery

8

would be included in the named representative's gross

9

income.

I don't think that the named representative would

10

be on the hook, if you will, for all of the attorney's

11

fees that would relate to other class members' recoveries.

12

But I think what all this points out is that --

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, then -- then would it

14

be -- would the income then go to each class -- would each

15

class member have a share of the income?

16

MR. SALMONS:

In a number of instances, yes,

17

Your Honor.

18

class action cases should be resolved is the same way that

19

-- that these issues are approached in all cases, which is

20

to look at the type of relationship that exists between

21

the -- the client and the attorney to see whether the

22

payment is made in -- in response to a debt owed by the

23

client and also to look to the degree of control that the

24

client has over the -- the underlying source of income.

25

And in this context, it is --

Again, the -- the way that we think that

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose -- suppose the same

2

amount were paid, as was paid here, to the attorney, but

3

it was not by way of a contingent fee, that the -- the

4

client had committed to pay this dollar amount in a dollar

5

amount.

6

MR. SALMONS:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

would the tax treatment of that be?

9

MR. SALMONS:

As a flat fee?
As a flat fee.

What -- what

Your Honor, I think in fact it is

10

undisputed in -- in the -- in these cases that if the

11

payment of attorney's fees had either been under an hourly

12

rate arrangement or a flat fee arrangement, that the

13

entire amount of the litigation proceeds would be included

14

in the -- in the respondent's gross income and nothing

15

about the contingent fee arrangements here should --

16

should alter that result.

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

The respondents -Well, let -- let me ask you

18

about Professor Davenport's theory.

19

amicus brief here saying that the contingency fee or the

20

attorney's fees should be capitalized as a transaction

21

cost increasing the basis of the property which was the

22

claim in the lawsuit.

23

MR. SALMONS:

He filed a -- an

Your Honor, I'm trying to recall

24

that amicus brief.

25

argument, I believe, about the application of section 83

I believe that -- was that an

12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

of the tax code when you have a transaction --

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

3

MR. SALMONS:

4

Yes.

-- in exchange for services and

you provide property?

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

6

MR. SALMONS:

Yes.

We think that the better way to

7

analyze this is that in fact there was no transfer of the

8

underlying cause of action, and so we think that -- that

9

we -- that gets into a very complicated area as to how you

10

value the attorney's fees at the time.

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, you -- you don't need a

transfer of the -- I don't understand what you mean --

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I don't either.
-- a transfer of the -- the

15

cause of action.

16

estate and -- and there's lawyer's business connected with

17

it, you -- you don't -- you don't take an ordinary

18

deduction which is subject to the alternative minimum tax

19

for those lawyer's fees.

20

transaction, and it goes onto the basis of your property.

21

Right?

22
23
24
25

Certainly if you buy a piece of real

MR. SALMONS:
Honor.

You just say that's part of the

I believe that's correct, Your

But the point I was making -JUSTICE SCALIA:

very similar to this?

Why isn't -- why isn't that

I mean, what difference does it

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

make whether there's a -- there's a transaction here,

2

isn't there?

3

Isn't there a transaction?

MR. SALMONS:

Well, there is an agreement to pay

4

a fee for a service, and in that sense there is a

5

transaction, yes.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but a -- the service is

7

connected to a transaction, namely the conversion of the

8

chosen action into a money payment.

9

MR. SALMONS:

10

You have this --

That -- that is correct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- this unformed chosen action.

11

You're entitled to it, but there's a transaction

12

converting it into a money payment.

13

you attribute to that transaction all -- which is

14

profitable to you, all of the costs that go along with the

15

transaction?

16

MR. SALMONS:

Now, why shouldn't

Well, again, Your Honor, we think

17

that transaction is essentially identical to numerous

18

transactions that take place every day out in the real

19

world where -- where taxpayers retain professional

20

services in exchange for a commission or a percentage of

21

the income that's generated.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

to me.

24

you can't draw a line.

25

MR. SALMONS:

That is a problem that occurs

I don't know where you draw the line.

And you say

That is absolutely correct.

I

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

don't see any basis for distinguishing between --

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MR. SALMONS:

How does it work?

-- the attorneys here and -- and a

4

-- and an agent negotiating a book contract for an author

5

or a financial analyst.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- on that, that example,

7

you gave the book contract with the author and you gave, I

8

think, the investor.

9

cases or would the author get an above-the-line deduction?

10

MR. SALMONS:

Would this problem arise in those

No, Your Honor.

I believe that

11

the author in those -- in that situation would receive the

12

same deduction that prior to the enactment of section 703

13

of the American Jobs Creation Act where Congress just

14

addressed in part the -- the issue raised in these

15

cases --

16
17
18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you say the author -- that

these people are all in the same -MR. SALMONS:

They would have an itemized --

19

excuse me -- a miscellaneous itemized deduction for the

20

cost incurred in -- in producing income that under the

21

alternative minimum tax would not be allowed.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is there any argument -- you

23

-- you said at the outset that it has to be an itemized

24

deduction subject to the two percent rule even if we set

25

aside the alternative minimum tax.

Is that conceded by

15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

everyone, or does somebody -- do some people say this is

2

an ordinary and necessary expense?

3

business, but it seems to me an ordinary and necessary

4

expense to recover the -- the -- for employment

5

discrimination, which is really part of your work.

6

don't know why -- is it -- does everybody agree that this

7

is subject to the 2 percent rule?

8
9

MR. SALMONS:

I know it's not your

I

I will -- I will have to allow

respondents to speak for themselves to that question, but

10

as far as I'm aware, that is not in dispute in these cases

11

or in any of the cases that have been litigated that --

12

that but -- that but for the alternative minimum tax, the

13

way this would have been handled is that there would have

14

been a miscellaneous itemized deduction under section 212

15

of the code for the cost incurred in producing income, and

16

that the alternative minimum tax, along with, by the way,

17

a large number of other perfectly valid deductions, get

18

disallowed under the alternative minimum tax.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I can't get out of my

20

mind in this case that the mechanics of the particular

21

case may control.

22

forth.

23

is a settlement or a judgment paid under a case where

24

there's a contingency fee contract, the check is made out

25

both to the attorney and to the client and is put in the

I know we need a national rule and so

My recollection is that in some States when there

16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

attorney's client's trust account.

2

has control over it.

3

MR. SALMONS:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

in most of the States.

6

MR. SALMONS:

So the client never

Well -Let's assume that that's true

That -- that -- I know that were

7

-- that was the facts, Your Honor, in the -- in the Banks

8

case, that there was a check made out to both.

9

in fact, there was --

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In fact --

So in a very real -- in -- in

11

a very real sense, in a -- in the legal sense, the client

12

just doesn't have control.

13

MR. SALMONS:

Well, Your Honor, we disagree with

14

that for, it seems to me, at least three reasons.

15

first is that at the time the client entered into the fee

16

agreement, he certainly had control then.

17

control over his cause of action.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, he -- he did or he

didn't, but there was no money there.

20

there.
MR. SALMONS:

He had complete

He was --

24

entitled to recover based on the injury he suffered that

25

was cognizable at law and that gave raise to a cause of

action.
Now, in exchange for legal services, he promised

3

to pay a portion of the recovery to the lawyer.

4

promise to pay a fee.

5

other transfer of the underlying cause of action.

6

is undisputed, I think --

7

That is a

That is not an assignment or any

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And it

Mr. Salmons, doesn't the

8

plausibility of your argument here rest on the assumption

9

that what the -- that the cause of action at the time the

10

-- that the plaintiff made the agreement with the lawyer

11

is a cause of action which has the same value as the

12

ultimate recovery that the lawyer gets?

13

the cause of action at the time of the agreement with the

14

lawyer has an inchoate value.

15

actually realized is going to depend in part on the -- on

16

the skill and -- and the -- the gumption of the lawyer.

17

Whereas, in fact,

The -- the value that is

So that the -- what I'm getting at -- and -- and

18

going to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems to me that

19

the value realized as opposed to the right to sue are two

20

different figures.

21

client has complete control over the value realized, which

22

we don't even know until the lawyer has done his work and

23

gotten the check.

24
25

And I don't see realistically how the

MR. SALMONS:
question, if I may.

Your Honor, two responses to that

The first is that, as a matter of

18
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

law, it is the client that controls the cause of action

2

and throughout the time period, even after they -- they

3

enter into an -- a contingent fee agreement, it is the

4

client that owns and controls the cause of action and he

5

decides whether to settle.

6

forward or withdraw the case.

7

the lawyer or not.

8

the income.

9

He decides whether to press
He decides whether to fire

He is a -- he controls the source of

Therefore --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even -- even the potential

12

says, dentist, I'm going to give you a deal.

13

like to take risks.

14

case you get everything; and I may lose, in which case you

15

get nothing.

16

the client in that agreement with his dentist give what

17

will be the lawyer's fee, the part that will go to the

18

lawyer under the contingency fee agreement?

19

I mean, suppose this client has a major

I know you

I may win big in my lawsuit, in which

The dentist says, fine, I'll take it.

MR. SALMONS:

Can

Well, presumably, Your Honor, if

20

he's already -- he's already promised that to the

21

attorney, he would be in violation of his agreement with

22

the attorney if he did so, and his attorney could sue him

23

to recover or the dentist could sue him to recover.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then he doesn't have -- then

he doesn't have dominion over that portion.

19
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. SALMONS:

Well, because he's -- he's given

2

it away.

3

this, if I may just go back to one point that Justice

4

Souter made and that is that I don't think it's the case

5

that our analysis turns at all on how you value the claim,

6

either at the time of the fee agreement or afterwards.

7

Our analysis says at all relevant times, regardless of

8

whether the value changed or not, the client was at all

9

times in control of the underlying source of income, and

10

it's just as if in Helvering v. Horst the father assigns

11

the -- the bond coupon to his son, but he controls the

12

underlying source of income.

13
14

In that sense I think -- and -- and in answering

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but the bond coupon has a

certain value at the time the father assigns it.

15

MR. SALMONS:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's true.
The only thing that has to be

17

realized after the assignment of the coupon is the passage

18

of time at which it will be payable.

19

a definite value.

20

for sure what that value will be until the lawsuit is over

21

with.

22

Here we do not have

We don't know -- there's no way to know

The -- the two are not comparable.
MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, that would be equally

23

true of an assignment of a stock dividend while I retain

24

the stock.

25

going to be, but if I control the underlying source of

I may not know what the dividend payment is

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

income, i.e., the stock, then the transfer to someone else

2

of the dividend doesn't alter the incident of tax, even if

3

it's unknown.

4

And I would point out that in Lucas v. Earl, the

5

husband and wife in that case entered into agreement to

6

assign to each other 50 percent of their income in 1901,

7

long before the income tax was even instituted, and the

8

tax years at issue in that case were 1920 and 1921.

9

anything, it was much more speculative and uncertain what

If

10

income would have been earned 20 years later in that case,

11

and that did not stop the Court from --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. SALMONS:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're -- you're --

-- applying this principle that -Can I -- can I ask you a

15

question relating to the Davenport -- what's been referred

16

to as the Davenport theory?

17

the service has used the -- the transaction theory with

18

regard to legal fees payable for a lawsuit seeking

19

increased compensation for the condemnation of real estate

20

where the taxpayer had objected to the amount that the

21

condemning entity was offering and brought suit in court

22

and with a contingent fee to the lawyer and that the

23

service treated that as -- as part of the transaction

24

cost.

25

I had thought that -- that

Am I wrong about that?
MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, to my knowledge, the

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- the IRS has had a consistent position that the entire

2

amount of litigation proceeds, including the amount that

3

may be paid to a lawyer under a contingent fee agreement,

4

even in the condemnation context, is tax -- is included in

5

the gross income of -- of the taxpayer.

6

And I would point Your Honor to the case out of

7

the Federal Circuit, Baylin v. United States.

8

involved a condemnation action, and the court of appeals

9

in that case addressed the issue that's presented in these

That case

10

cases and concluded that it was includable in gross

11

income.

12
13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe my recollection is wrong.

I'll look again.
MR. SALMONS:

And -- and I would point out, Your

15

Honor -- and this has to do, I think, with the impact of

16

the new legislation that's been pointed to in the

17

supplemental briefs -- that at least six of the court of

18

appeals cases addressing the issue presented in these

19

cases involved claims that would not be covered under the

20

new section 703 because they -- they don't involve claims

21

for unlawful discrimination or -- or FCA claims or certain

22

Medicare claims --

JUSTICE BREYER:

But can -- can I ask you to go

24

back for a minute?

I guess the IRS -- you're seeing the

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SALMONS:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And you're looking at the

3

control of the plaintiff, for example, over the lawsuit as

4

something that determines whether it's his income.

5

he, of course, can't give away his income.

6

theory, to go back to Justice O'Connor's original

7

question, then the punitive damages also must be his

8

income because he has equal control over them and they

9

grow out of the income-producing asset.

And

But on that

And that, of

10

course, is what's bothering me because it seems to me that

11

your theory, which is a well-established theory, coupled

12

with a Congress that seems to be willing to take away

13

deductions for expenses that lead to the income, could

14

produce an income tax that in many cases, not just a few,

15

exceeds the income that an individual has.

16

like to know what in the law is there to guard against

17

that result.

18
19
20
21

MR. SALMONS:

And I would

Well, Your Honor, I guess my

response to that is that, first -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Other -- other than the mercy

of the Internal Revenue Service.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, the fact of the matter

24

is, is that Congress has looked at -- at this issue, and

25

in the new section that I just referred to, section 703 --

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but does that happen?

2

You haven't answered the question.

3

where plaintiffs in lawsuits end up receiving tax bills,

4

as a result of this scheme, for more money than they

5

received in the lawsuit?

6

MR. SALMONS:

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

8

MR. SALMONS:

9

concerns about that very result --

10
11

That has occurred, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- in the new section.
-- something basically flawed

about your whole theory?

15

MR. SALMONS:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

Well, but doesn't -- doesn't

that indicate -MR. SALMONS:

17

Yes.

And -- and Congress responded to

14

Are there instances

No, Your Honor.

It is --

This is not income in any --

in any real sense.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any constitutional

19

protection?

20

tax, and perhaps that doesn't include a tax that grossly

21

exceeds in many cases a person's income.

22

quite a far-out theory at the moment.

The Sixteenth Amendment refers to an income

23

MR. SALMONS:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

That would be

I think it would be, Your Honor.
But I -- that's why I ask you.

Is there any protection in the law whatsoever?

Or if

24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress decides to tax a set of people who, let's see --

2

say, earn $10,000 a year and because they're small

3

business people, they happen to have $20,000 expenses.

4

it taxes them on $20,000, and the tax exceeds the income.

5

There's no protection in your view against that result.

6

And you just said, well, Congress decided to do it, it

7

decided to do it.

8
9

MR. SALMONS:

But we do think, Your Honor, that

the only limit on Congress' taxing authority would be the

10

Constitution, and I don't see a constitutional violation

11

in disallowing a deduction, but --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about an assumption, for

13

example, that when we read the code, we read it with a

14

view towards thinking Congress did not want to produce

15

such unfair results?

16

So

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, if I may.

The way I

17

would respond to that concern is that the proper way to

18

address it is not as the courts below did and as

19

respondents urge, to alter or distort the general

20

definition for gross income under the -- under the tax

21

code which may have broad ramifications in a number of

22

areas outside of this one, but to go to Congress, as in

23

fact people have done, and to get them to make -- make

24

additional deductions or otherwise alter the alternative

25

minimum tax, which generates the primary concern I think

at issue in these cases.

that.

have to deal in hypotheticals.

was $99,000, if I remember right.

were pointed out to Congress and that was part of what

17

motivated Congress --

actually happened in that case, do you know?

my understanding is that the tax was assessed and I don't

know whether --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Salmons, I -- I -- you've

2

cited the -- the Baylin case to me and I -- I've looked at

3

the description of it in the brief, which I had recalled,

4

and what it says is that it did, indeed, involve a taking

5

by the State, and when the State didn't offer what Baylin

6

thought was -- was enough, he went to court, he prevailed,

7

and recovered a much larger sum than the State had offered

him.

Professor Davenport has misdescribed the case in -- in his

may.

23

that the definition of gross income cuts across the tax

code.

proper result is to go to Congress, as has been done.

I think the -- the basic point to recall here is

If there are concerns about application, then the

Alderson Reporting Company

would say is that the thing to focus on is what Congress

legislation itself makes clear that it's included in gross

income and an above-the-line deduction is provided, and

22

that the colloquy was referring to a prior version of the

this Court to rule is -- is not the partnership or joint

venture theory.

simply look at the application of the assignment of income

doctrine and ask it -- if it is being misapplied.

determined by the litigation.

search for buried treasure --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -Why do we need the question of

raised, even to arise if -- if the principal criterion is

going to be economic non-tax purpose?

MR. JONES:

I agree completely.

I was trying to

those cases, but I agree --

The Court in that case was

attacking a result because that arrangement stayed in

place after the income tax was -- was enacted.

asking you to dishonor this relationship because Mr.

16

Those relationships are all respected and honored

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think probably what's --

17

what's one of the problems here is that the reason this is

19

hiring the attorney to get that income is not an ordinary

20

and necessary business expense under what used to be

section 162.

agree that it's not an ordinary and necessary business

expense?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, I suppose that's the

reason -- that's the reason why it's taxable to begin

because I'm wrongfully discharged and I get -- I get my

job back, it seems to me that's an ordinary and necessary

reasons I have problems with this.

odd result here of a person having to pay more in taxes

The Oregon question is part IV of

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what do you make of

20

Professor Davenport's proposal to capitalize the

contingency fee as a transaction?

I believe Professor Davenport is

completely correct.

We didn't make that argument because we believe the

I support his theory wholeheartedly.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, if you took a settlement

3

-- his theory, I take it, was seeing the lawsuit as a

4

capital asset.

Is that right?

5

MR. JONES:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Well, I -- I think so.
Well, then whenever you settled

7

a lawsuit, it would be -- you'd have to pay capital gains

8

instead of ordinary income.

9

MR. JONES:

I -- I'm sorry.

10

I'm not sure that's his theory.

11

I'm --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think I misspoke.

I'm not certain, and

I'm sure it's not his theory.

13

He -- he thinks it's -- it's attached to transactions, and

14

-- and much of his argument is devoted to showing that

15

capital transactions are no different from other

16

transactions as far as the Internal Revenue Code's desire

17

to match the -- the gain with the expenses concerned.

18

that's the part of his theory that I'm not so sure about

19

because aside from the -- aside from the condemnation case

that I mentioned, I -- I don't know of any other cases in

which the Internal Revenue Service has treated transaction

out, that at the time of the agreement between the husband

the agreement certainly was in existence after the income

your view the moment the client gets the check for the

And I have some problems, incidentally, with

doctrine.

MR. CARTY:

I would state, Your Honor, that the

assignment of income doctrine simply does not apply when

fundamentally different from the types of relationships

you cited, and that's because an attorney here is the one

the critical decisions.

I think there's a -- there's a fundamental difference.

Presumably a -- a actor or an entertainer -- their --

their market value is -- already has some type of tangible

value.

The -- the agent might --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your client, in effect, earned

8

the money by having this -- undergo this -- this

9

discrimination.

That -- that's --

MR. CARTY:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, Your Honor -This is not the plumber

12

hypothetical, which is I think quite misleading.

13

I don't think that even the Government will defend that.

14

MR. CARTY:

No.

Again, Your Honor, I think with

15

respect to an entertainer, an entertainer necessarily

16

doesn't need an agent.

17

No,

Neither does an athlete.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Take an investment advisor

18

and the client is not at all -- doesn't know anything

19

about the market, and he's got this whiz-bang advisor who

20

makes millions for him that he never could have made on

21

his own.

22

MR. CARTY:

I -- I think that might be more

23

similar to the attorney-client relationship.

But Mr.

MR. CARTY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
The husband did.

So you want

14

to say where the -- and then your answer, I guess -- don't

16

find out later.

JUSTICE BREYER:

hypothetical about the agent and so forth is, well, so be

let him.

expert -- it doesn't matter since, after all, it would be

deductible anyway.

on this.

MR. CARTY:

Again, I -- what we're saying is the

5

unique situation of an attorney and a client, it is the

6

attorney who's taking the laboring, or unlike the

7

entertainer example where the -- where -- or the athlete

8

example --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay, I see.

You say double.

10

Both the income is earned by the attorney, and at that

11

stage the client does virtually nothing.

12

reverse of the Earls or the Lucases where the husband was

13

doing the work and the wife is getting the income.

14

would be as if the wife was doing all the work and the

15

husband just sat there and clipped coupons or whatever.

MR. CARTY:

So it's the

That's correct, Your Honor, and in

Lucas v. Earl, it was the assignor who earned the income

that was subject to disposition.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm not so sure about that

because why doesn't the theory that -- that applies to the

JUSTICE SCALIA:
You should --

JUSTICE BREYER:

You should agree with that.

times.

MR. CARTY:

Nevertheless -- nevertheless, I -- I

8

think there may be some -- some difference in degree that

9

you might even recognize between the two cases.

10

Another issue I'd like to address is the impact

11

of the fee shifting statutes, if I could get to that

12

quickly.

13

settlements of a claim are taxed the same as a judgment

14

would have been taxed.

15

in lieu of his claims under title VII and 42 U.S.C.,

16

sections 1981 and 1983.

17

It is a bedrock principle of taxation that

Mr. Banks' settlement was achieved

Now, each of these statutes contains a fee

18

shifting provision which enables a court to award

19

attorney's fees to a prevailing plaintiff.

20

in Mr. Banks' case, the California Department of Education

21

-- they therefore settled Mr. Banks' claim in lieu of

22

their exposure under these fee shifting statutes.

23

The defendant

An award pursuant to these fee shifting statutes

24

is separate and distinct from a damages recovery and

25

therefore should not be taxable to a plaintiff.

And the

1

Federal tax consequences to Mr. Banks, the litigant who

2

settles, shouldn't be any different as well.

Otherwise,

3

this Court would be discouraging settlement.

Therefore, a

4

judicial anti-abuse rule should not be misused to

5

undermine the statutory scheme devised by Congress to

6

encourage civil rights litigants to bring meritorious

7

claims and vindicate national policy.

8

Unless the Court has any further questions?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

one thing.

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SALMONS:

It is clear that the only thing that

respondents' attorneys earned under the fee agreements was

6

the right to be paid a fee for their services.

petitioner's view, those agreements don't even give rise

8

to an assignment of income in the ordinary sense.

9

look at the text of the fee agreement in the Banaitis case

In

If you

10

-- the Banks' fee agreement is not in the record -- among

11

other things, it makes clear that if there is a

12

termination -- and it provides lots of grounds on which

13

the attorney-client relationship can be terminated -- that

14

the attorney will be paid a reasonable fee, calculated at

15

the sum of $175 per hour.

16

assignment of any income or even an assignment of the

17

underlying cause of action.

18

that in every assignment of income case, the assignor

loses control over that income that he assigned.

however.

States at issue here -- and in fact, in all States of

To address just a couple of questions that came

up, I would point out that in the class action context,

again, as I indicated, there are a number of differences.

22

generally speaking there's no unilateral right to settle a

fee.
