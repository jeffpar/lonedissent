CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in American Trucking Associations v. Michigan Public

5

Service Commission and a companion case.

Mr. Digges.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230

9
10

MR. DIGGES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case is a challenge to Michigan's $100 per

12

truck flat annual fee that is imposed on all trucks that

13

are registered to do point-to-point operations in the

14

State of Michigan.

15

truck fee, has the same impermissible effects on

16

interstate commerce as the two flat truck fees that were

17

struck down by this Court in American Trucking

18

Associations v. Scheiner.

19

We submit that this fee, this flat per

In the American Trucking Associations v.

20

Scheiner case, this Court looked at the practical effect

21

of these fees and found that because of their

22

unapportioned structure, that the fees had four

23

interrelated types of impermissible effects on interstate

24

commerce.

25

First, the Court found that these kinds of flat

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

fees were a financial barrier against out-of-state motor

2

carriers even coming into the State that imposed the -

3

the fee.

4

Michigan flat fee has the same kind of protectionist

5

quality.

6

There's no question in this case that the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it -- it does for trucks

7

that want to deliver things within the State of Michigan.

8

It doesn't for anybody else.

9

MR. DIGGES:

Yes, it -- it discriminates and it

10

-- it has an exclusory effect on trucks -- out-of-state

11

carriers that want to compete in the -- and bring their

12

trucks across the -- the border of Michigan and compete

13

against local carriers for intrastate hauls.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It would have that -- it

15

certainly has that tendency.

16

fact what the effect is?

17

many trucks does it affect?

18

MR. DIGGES:

19

don't have that fact.

20

Do we have -- do we know in

Is it deterring anybody?

There was not a trial below.

How

So we

We believe that as in the Scheiner case, these

21

-- these tendencies are inherent there.

22

structure of the fee, it not only has this effect, it has

23

what this Court called a hydraulic pressure effect, and

24

that is to -- for carriers, once they have paid this fee

25

as an entrance fee, to pull their trucks out of interstate

Because of the

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

commerce and to concentrate them into -- in the State of

2

Michigan in the local activities.

3

the State acknowledges that.

4

motor carriers should allocate or dedicate their trucks to

5

the State of Michigan in order to avoid these

6

consequences.

7

recognized that, saying a local carrier would be

8

discouraged from operating in interstate commerce.

9

And that -- in fact,

Below, the State said that

And even the Michigan Court of Appeals

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, it also -- I mean,

10

you say it -- it favors the in-state -- intrastate carrier

11

because if you're doing nothing but intrastate carriage,

12

you -- you amortize the $100 over many more miles, whereas

13

the interstate carrier, much of whose business is out-of

14

state, doesn't do that.

15

On the other hand, you can certainly argue that

16

-- that this tax discriminates against intrastate carriers

17

in -- in another respect, that is to say, interstate

18

carriers who -- who do nothing within the State do not pay

19

it, whereas the -- the Michigan carrier that does a lot of

20

interstate business but if he does one piece of intrastate

21

business -- interstate business, he still pays it.

22

that right?

23

MR. DIGGES:

Isn't

Well, Your Honor, I think what -

24

what that's saying -- and I know that was the argument

25

made in the Solicitor General's brief -- is that you can

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

discriminate against one component of interstate commerce,

2

those carriers that want to actually compete and do

3

intrastate business in the State, as long as you give a

4

benefit to another component of interstate commerce, those

5

who just wish to operate in the -- in the State of

6

Michigan in interstate commerce.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, it's not so much that you

8

necessarily can do it, but it -- it sort of interrupts the

9

-- the kind of the a priori reasoning and you're thrown

10

back on a -- on -- on a practical effects analysis under

11

Pike.

12

MR. DIGGES:

No, Your Honor.

I think what

13

happens is that -- that there are the segment of carriers

14

that would like to compete against intrastate carriers.

15

The fact that other carriers may be getting a break in

16

terms of regulatory fees -- and we don't know that to be

17

the truth, getting the other interstate carriers.

18

the Boston Stock Exchange, and I think it was said again

19

in the Scheiner case that -- that you can't discriminate

20

among interstate carriers.

21

It's

And as we pointed out in our brief, you could

22

set up a situation in which a -- a State discriminated in

23

favor of interstate carriers in situations or industries

24

where their locals had no interest in competing, but where

25

their -- their locals were interested in competing, they

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

could set up a discriminatory system.

2

timber industry in -- in Oregon and -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you can protect

But may I ask this question?

4

Suppose you have an interstate carrier that does 100,000

5

miles of business in Michigan and you have an intrastate

6

carrier that does a 100,000 miles of business in Michigan.

7

They both say the -- pay the same tax, don't they?

8
9

MR. DIGGES:

If they each do 100,000 miles of

intrastate business in Michigan -

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

MR. DIGGES:

12
13

Yes.

-- they would pay the same flat

fee.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

They would both pay the same

14

tax, both the intra and the interstate.

15

sound to me like discrimination against either one.

16

MR. DIGGES:

Now, that doesn't

If -- if this -- if this tax was

17

apportioned based on mileage, it would not be

18

discrimination, but unfortunately, it is not and -

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but I'm just saying if the

20

intrastate and interstate carriers both have the same

21

intrastate mileage, they both pay the same tax.

22

MR. DIGGES:

And we -- we would -- and again, if

23

this was a mileage-apportioned fee, it would be -- it

24

would be fine.

25

of-state carriers, because the interstate carrier is -- is

But the fact is as in Scheiner, the out-

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

operating -

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but you might have an

3

intrastate carrier that does a smaller amount of mileage,

4

only 50,000 miles, and an interstate carrier that pays -

5

does 100,000 miles.

6

everybody is treated alike on their intrastate business.

They both pay the same tax too.

7

MR. DIGGES:

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

And

That would be true but that And the tax only operates on

intrastate business.

10

MR. DIGGES:

The factual situation is going to

11

be that the interstate carrier is just not going to have

12

the opportunity to do as much business in Michigan as the

13

intrastate carrier.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it seems to me you should

15

have introduced some evidence on that point.

16

-- it really is an assumption of your unfairness argument

17

that purely intrastate carriers do significantly more

18

intrastate business than interstate carriers who choose to

19

do some interstate business.

20

self-evident?

I mean, it

Now, does that strike you as

It does not need any -

21

MR. DIGGES:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. DIGGES:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

-- demonstration?

It does strike me as self-evident.

24

In fact, to courts below -- we have -- we've made this

25

argument.

We've seen this argument now.

The cases have

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

called it intuitively obvious.

2

-- in the Scheiner case and from the discussion in the

3

Nippert case, the very difference between interstate and

4

intrastate commerce means that on average the interstate

5

carrier is just not going to use the State's facilities as

6

much as the in-state carrier.

7

And from the discussion of

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Wouldn't we be better

8

able to decide this question after a trial rather than

9

speculation on both sides?

10

MR. DIGGES:

I don't think a trial is necessary

11

because, as I say, this -- this Court quoted Justice

12

Frankfurter clearly, and I think the Solicitor General in

13

his brief says that on average the out-of-state carrier is

14

not going to get as much benefit from this fee.

15

variable cost fee.

16

having to pay more than its fair share of the cost of the

17

-- of the State's regulatory system.

18

something that was accepted in the Scheiner case, accepted

19

in -- in the Nippert case.

20

every time that it operates in the State, it is using that

21

privilege.

22
23

This is a

In effect, the out-of-state carrier is

And again, that's

And the intrastate carrier -

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, Nippert was over

100 years ago, wasn't it?

I think the Nippert case was from

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

It seems like 100

years ago.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. DIGGES:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's -Mr. Digges, this -- the -

7

the -- there was a question about the ramifications of the

8

position that you're presenting.

9

situations in which there is some kind of licensing fee

That is, there are many

10

that is imposed on everyone, the same dollar amount,

11

although some people who are licensed will be doing

12

business in other States and have to get licenses there as

13

well.

14

briefs on the other side of the lawyer who is licensed,

15

say, in Massachusetts and also in D.C. does not get any

16

break on his D.C. Bar admission because he is also

17

admitted in Massachusetts, and in fact, does most of his

18

practice out-of-state, out of the District.

19

The example that was featured in the -- in the

MR. DIGGES:

Yes, Your Honor.

I know that -

20

that example was given.

21

flat fees that would be unaffected by this.

22

fees that would be administrative charges and -- and if

23

all the State is doing is charging, for example, the cost

24

of a background investigation or the cost of a truck

25

inspection, a fixed cost, then it's fair to ask the

I think there are a variety of

carrier to pay a fixed fee or to ask the taxpayer to pay a

2

fixed fee.

3

With respect to the bar fees, they are obviously

4

different than the trucking industry and -- and the

5

taxation of an instrumentality in interstate commerce.

6

But we think that there may be impracticalities in

7

apportioning a bar fee.

8

office in Virginia that is working for a California

9

customer or California client that is being -- for a case

You could have an attorney in his

10

that is being tried in the court system of Oregon, and

11

then for transaction work, he could be working for a

12

customer or a client in -- in Missouri for -- a multi-

13

state.

14

haven't really examined that.

15

So it may be difficult to apportion fees.

We

But we know from this Court's decisions that -

16

that is easy and can be apportioned for truck fees, and

17

truck fees -- this Court said in Scheiner that the

18

technology is now available to look at the extent of the

19

activity and the taxpayer in -- in -- of the truck in the

20

State, and later on in a subsequent decision said that you

21

can easily track large physical objects over States.

22

you can apportion these fees on trucks to their mileage in

23

the State, to their loads, to the gross revenue associated

24

with the -

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

The Scheiner case didn't

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

make a distinction based on in-state activity.

2

that that -- that flat fee was applicable to every motor

3

carrier that went on the roads in Pennsylvania.

4

MR. DIGGES:

I thought

That is accurate, Your Honor, but

5

-- but nominally Scheiner -- for instance, the

6

Pennsylvania Supreme Court in the Scheiner case did say

7

that -- did uphold the fee because they said only

8

Pennsylvania could charge for the privilege of using

9

Pennsylvania's highways.

So like a lot of -- like all

10

interstate commerce, you can always -- as -- as the Court

11

said in Nippert, you can always find -- carve out a local

12

activity to say that this is going to be the focus of the

13

tax.

14

I think a problem here is with the -- the

15

approach taken by the State and the Solicitor General is

16

they suggest that you go back to the days in which you're

17

trying to draw a line between interstate and intrastate

18

activity, this time not because the intrastate activity is

19

going to be immune from the tax, but this time because

20

you're going to have some separate, different kind of test

21

applicable to something that clearly is subject to

22

Commerce Clause protections, but is -- is, in their view,

23

subject to a more lenient Commerce Clause protection.

24

I don't think this Court wants to retreat back to the days

25

of having to draw a line between interstate and intrastate

If there are no more questions, I'd like to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. HANSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1234
MR. HANSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In contrast to the ATA case, the question before

vehicles operating solely in interstate commerce is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Do -- do I understand that the

10

two distinctions in what is done with the -- or the way

11

the fee is collected and what's done with it is that the

12

-- the fee is charged against the -- is it the operator as

13

opposed to the owner, if there is a distinction?

14

that correct?

15
16

MR. HANSON:

Is -- is

All of the fees under subsections

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now, let -- that's -- that's a

2

premise for a question I want to ask you, and the question

3

is in economic effect, is there any difference really

4

between charging this $100 fee with those differences from

5

the registration fee and simply jacking up the

6

registration fee by $100?

7

any economic difference to the -- to the public or -- or

8

indeed even to the carriers if they simply jacked up the

9

-- the registration fee by $100?

Would there -- would there be

Because the -- the

10

registration fee is passed on to the carrier, if it's not

11

the owner, and the carrier -- it doesn't make any

12

difference to the carrier whether the -- whether the State

13

diverts the $100 up front or -- or divides the -- the

14

registration fee after it's paid.

15

economic difference?

16

MR. HANSON:

So is there any

Yes, there is and the reason why

17

there is a difference is that the -- the fees that are

18

paid for plating are under the -- under the International

19

Reciprocity Plan, the registration plan, the IRP.

20

that is an apportioned fee.

21

vehicles, all commercial motor vehicles, regardless of

22

whether it's for-hire or private, regardless of it's in

state or -- of interstate.

to the money after it's paid, but it doesn't make any

difference to the person who is paying the money, does it?

That -- that tells us what happens

in one place, and -- and if they -

Yes, it does.

MR. HANSON:

In terms of the plating fee?
Yes.

Each State is free to charge its -

its own amount as the plating fee.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, but it -- so -- so

6

regardless of what Michigan does with the apportioned

amounts, the amount it charges to the -- to the owner, in

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. HANSON:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So what -- and -- and the -

the virtue of the apportionment is that the -- that the

not have to pay fees in 49 other States.

of the -- the end effect on the person who has to pay it

and on the consumers to whom it is ultimately passed on,

5

what difference does it make?

6

MR. HANSON:

Well, the -- the difference for the

person who is paying it under IRP is that if only 20

percent of their interstate miles as a solely interstate

9

10

they would, in fact, only pay $20 per vehicle.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

Mr. Boynton, we'll

MR. BOYNTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

The petitioner, American Trucking, began its

8

reply brief with the claim that the central reality in

9

this case is that the Michigan intrastate fee places

10

significant burdens on interstate commerce.

11

Court of Appeals rejected this claim squarely, saying that

12

as a matter of -- that that was a matter of pure

13

speculation.

14

The Michigan

There's no evidence in the record before this

15

Court that the trucking companies' route choices are

16

affected by the intrastate fee.

17

evidence in the record that the intrastate fee keeps

18

anyone out from engaging in intrastate trucking in

19

Michigan.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Furthermore, there is no

It sure does make sense to me,

21

though.

22

nothing but intrastate Michigan business will, by and

23

large, log in many more miles intrastate than a company

24

which does interstate business but part of its business is

25

intrastate Michigan business.

Surely it's the case that a company that does

2

MR. BOYNTON:

Well, the Michigan Court of

Appeals said that that very well may be the case, but they

pointed to the fact that there were no facts to support

5

that finding.

And this is completely different than in

the cost to an interstate trucker in that situation was

12

here.

13

You just simply don't have those facts

What you have is a discrete or a distinct local

14

activity that is something that doesn't affect the

15

interstate commerce.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -- it's the case that a

17

company that does only intrastate Michigan business logs

all of its miles on -- in Michigan.

19

outside of Michigan.

20

MR. BOYNTON:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right?

No miles

That's right.
And it seems to me it's obvious

22

that a -- a company that does interstate business does not

23

log all of its miles in -- in Michigan, and likely -

24

likely -- very likely does -- does less miles in Michigan

25

than -- than a purely intrastate Michigan trucker.

MR. BOYNTON:

well may be true, but we don't have any way of -- of

qualifying or quantifying the burden here because we don't

have those facts.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Is it difficult to apportion

6

the intrastate fee based on the number of miles traveled

intrastate?

8
9

MR. BOYNTON:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I think it

is very difficult to do that.

As the United States noted

10

in its brief, they didn't think that mileage would be

11

appropriate because this -- this fee doesn't support the

maintenance of the highways.

Michigan?

2

MR. BOYNTON:

Well, Your Honor, the Michigan

3

Court of Appeals had taken the position that this was a

4

fee, not a tax, and under a fee -- if -- if a fee was

5

$10,000, if the expenses matched the -- the revenue from

position, that -- that it doesn't violate the Commerce
Clause so long as it's a fee not a tax?
MR. BOYNTON:

Your Honor, we think that the -

12

if it's a fee and not a tax, the Michigan Court of Appeals

13

applied the correct standard, and that was the standard of

14

Pike v. Bruce Church.

15

whether the statute regulated even-handedly, whether it

16

affected a legitimate local -

And you would look to the -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

you immediately go to Pike Church.

Whenever it's a fee, not a tax,

19

MR. BOYNTON:

20

the Michigan Court of Appeals -

21
22

I think that -- that that was what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know.

I know that's what

they said.

23

MR. BOYNTON:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. BOYNTON:

of Appeals opinion -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What makes it a fee instead

8

to operate in the State of Michigan.

9

pointed out that it was in relation to the services

They were able

Second of all, they

granted, being able to do that, and then the third

11

component would be the voluntariness, whether they could

agree to -- they didn't have to engage in intrastate

trucking -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You could say the same about a

15

tax.

16

tax if you operate in Michigan.

17

operate; you don't have to pay it.

18

unless you pay the tax, you cannot operate in Michigan.

19

Does that make it a tax or a fee?

20

You could say, you know, you only have to pay this

MR. BOYNTON:

You don't want to
And you could also say

Well, I think in the Michigan

21

Court of Appeals opinion, it -- it was a fee, and I think

22

-- I think what we come back to, Your Honor, is the idea

23

is there a specific class of individuals or businesses

24

that are benefitted.

25

distinction between a fee and tax.

And I think that that's the

Also, a tax is a general revenue-raising

is that this fee, this intrastate fee, does not go to

purchase additional temporary permits as the need arose

referring to the interstate fee -

Are you going to address the

9

Are you going to address the

MR. BOYNTON:

I was going to do that right now,

Your Honor.

10

The position that the State of Michigan and the

11

Michigan Public Service Commission has is the SSRS does

12

not preempt the interstate fee.

13

is -

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And the reason for that

Well, what's the point of the

15

limitation in SSRS to $10 if the State can impose any

16

additional fee it wants just by calling it a different

17

name?

18

MR. BOYNTON:

Well, Your Honor, I think what you

19

have to realize is you have -- when you look at the text

20

of the statute, I think what is very clear from reading

21

the text is that the SSRS does not preempt all State fees

22

and charges on motor carriers.

23

fees and charges that are specifically related to the

24

registration of that motor carrier's interstate authority.

25

The interstate fee, or the Michigan-plated vehicle fee

It only preempts those

35
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

here, is not preempted because it's a regulatory fee that

2

does not relate to the registration of the motor carrier's

3

SSRS interstate authority.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, it -- it does.

5

Number one, it's somewhat suspect at the outset because it

6

applies only to interstate travel.

7

MR. BOYNTON:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Well -And -- and then the -- the

other vehicles pay $100 for the -- for the in-state fees,

10

and so this seems to me that -- that on -- on its face

11

shows that it's like a registration fee.

12

MR. BOYNTON:

Well, Your Honor, I think a couple

13

things.

14

look at the structure of the Michigan statute, you'll see

15

that under section 2, which contains both the interstate

16

fee and the intrastate fee, virtually all Michigan

17

vehicles that are plated in Michigan -- the effect of it

18

is that all vehicles that are plated in Michigan will have

19

paid this $100 fee.

20

Number one, I think that -- I believe that if you

And furthermore, if you look at section 7 of the

21

Michigan statute, which is 478.7, that involves the

22

registration procedure.

23

the registration of interstate authority.

24

section 7, subsection (4) deals with the payment of the

25

$10 fee for -- and -- and it's to be made by vehicles that

That's specifically applicable to

MR. BOYNTON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -- that's the problem.

Well, that's the argument.
That's the problem because here

5

we're dealing with the fee to be paid by the people who

are plated in Michigan, and it looks like that $100 is the

7

fee for them.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Boynton, may I just -- may

13

the Federal statute does not prevent Michigan from waiving

14

the $10 fee on -- for this particular purpose?

15

MR. BOYNTON:

Is part of your position that

Our position, with respect to

16

that, Your Honor, is the fact that under section 7 of the

17

Michigan Motor Carrier Act, 478.7, Michigan has no

18

authority to charge a Michigan-plated vehicle any fee at

19

all.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Right.

So that -- but you're

21

saying to Justice Breyer then is they have waived the $10

22

and they do it to a narrow class, those vehicles who are

23

plated in Michigan because they've already charged them

24

$100, a very heavy charge for the privilege of being

plated.

-- that it is vehicle-specific because it identifies the

5

you have to read the statute, the preemption statute, the

all State fees and charges on motor carrier vehicles are

Do you place any reliance in

this scheme on the fact that the only people subject to it

are people who have their principal place of business in

MR. BOYNTON:

No, Your Honor.

The triggering

event for the interstate fee is the plating of the vehicle

The United States as amicus curiae supports the

10

With respect to American Trucking, in our view

11

the central question in resolving the constitutional issue

12

is not whether it would be possible to apportion the

13

intrastate fee on a more precise basis.

14

whether the Constitution requires it.

15

The question is

16

brief, both the older cases dealing specifically with

17

intrastate transportation and the more recent cases

18

dealing with authority to engage in other intrastate

19

businesses, this Court has repeatedly upheld the authority

20

of States and municipalities to charge flat fees for the

privilege of engaging in the local business within the

jurisdiction during the -- the relevant period of time.

away from deciding Commerce Clause questions on the basis

2

of whether it is interstate commerce or local commerce,

3

you know, the original package doctrine and things that

succeeded it.

5

this -- this inquiry into whether it's really interstate

6

or -- or rather local.

7

MR. STEWART:

And you're -- you're just dragging back in

Well, with -- with respect, Your

8

Honor, I think the Court has certainly abandoned the

9

notion that there is a bright, absolute line between

10

intrastate activities which are subject to plenary

11

regulation by the States without any Commerce Clause

12

inquiry and interstate commerce which is wholly immune

13

from State regulation.

14

question is more complicated than that.

15

The Court has recognized that the

But in cases like Jefferson Lines, for instance,

16

the Court held that the sales price of a ticket for an

17

interstate bus trip could be taxed in -- in its entirety

18

by the State in which the ticket was purchased because the

19

sale of the ticket was regarded as a separate, discrete

20

event properly severable from the underlying interstate

21

transaction.

22

And the case for severance is all the more

23

powerful here.

24

an aspect of an interstate transaction, we're dealing with

25

point-to-point hauls within the State of Michigan.

That is, here we're dealing not with a -

true that those may be undertaken by trucks that also do

interstate business, and it's even true that in some

instances the intrastate load may be carried on the same

7

wholly irrelevant, in most instances, that the -- the

8

truck is also doing an interstate business.

9

But the intrastate haul is itself a
To the shipper it's

And to differentiate this case from Scheiner,

10

one of the things that the Court has looked at in the

11

dormant Commerce Clause inquiry is the risk of multiple

12

taxation.

13

taxation in -- in the abstract because it's necessarily

14

going to be the case that an entity that does business in

15

many States will be taxed in many States.

16

question is whether there's an undue risk of multiple

17

taxation on the same transaction or the same conduct or

18

the same activity.

19

And the Court doesn't just mean multiple

Rather the

And that was at real risk in Scheiner because if

20

you imagine a truck that's delivering cargo from Maine to

21

Florida and passing through several States on the way, and

22

it's required to pay a fee that is, in essence, a fee for

23

entering the State, has nothing to do with the mileage

24

traveled within the jurisdiction, it's entirely reasonable

25

to say that the imposition of those cumulative trips -

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

cumulative taxes for a single haul of goods from Maine to

2

Florida is an instance of multiple taxation of the same

3

event.

4

Here we don't have a problem with that.

The tax

5

is being levied solely on point-to-point hauls within the

6

State of Michigan.

7

point-to-point hauls in some other State within the

8

calendar year, it may be subject to two taxes, but they

9

can't be characterized as two taxes on the same conduct or

10

If a particular truck also makes

the same transaction.

11

The second aspect of -- of Scheiner --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, it could.

I mean, if -

13

if this -- this truck is making one -- one haul, it's

14

carrying some goods from Texas to -- to Maine, but some

15

other goods it picks up along the way within Tennessee and

16

just carries it to another place within Tennessee, and

17

then it picks some other goods in New Jersey, carries it

18

elsewhere to New Jersey, you're going to be taxed.

19

seems to me it's -- it's one trip.

It

20

We never used to -- used to divide railroads on

21

the basis of well, the ICC has jurisdiction over just the

22

interstate portions and -- and the two stops within a

23

State can be regulated by the State.

24
25

MR. STEWART:

I mean, I think you're right that

it wouldn't be reasonable to regard the within-Texas

segment or the within-Oklahoma segment of a transfer of

2

goods between States as a discrete, separable event.

3

if the truck is picking up goods at one point in Texas and

4

depositing them at another point in Texas, again from the

5

shipper's point of view, that's clearly a discrete

6

transaction.

in whether the same truck is simultaneously carrying goods

And it's reasonable to regard that as a

occurs.
The other point to make about Scheiner is that

12

even if we assume, as the petitioner argues, that the

13

average interstate truck that makes some point-to-point

14

hauls within Michigan will do so less frequently than the

15

average truck that does business solely within that State,

16

there's still a whole different class of interstate

17

truckers that makes substantial use of Michigan's roads

18

that could be charged taxes on the basis of mileage

19

traveled and they're being let off the hook because the

20

State has chosen to focus this tax on intrastate activity.

21

Petitioners' response to this is that you can't

22

discriminate against one class and then make up for it by

23

-- by discriminating in favor of a different class.

24
25

And if this were, to use title VII terminology,
a disparate treatment case, we would agree.

That is, if a

49
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

State overtly discriminates against one class of

2

interstate or out-of-state activities and on the face of

3

the law those people are treated less favorably, then we

4

would entirely agree that the State couldn't make up for

5

it by giving more favorable treatment to a different class

6

of out-of-state entities.

7

But here the petitioner is making what amounts

8

to a disparate impact claim, and the essence of a

9

disparate impact claim is not that any particular

10

individual has suffered unfair treatment.

11

prove a disparate impact claim is to show the effect

12

cumulatively upon the class, upon interstate truckers in

13

this case in the aggregate.

14

feel any kind of confidence that interstate truckers won't

15

do better as a group by virtue of Michigan's decision to

16

focus this tax on intrastate activity rather than on the

17

basis of mileage, which would sweep in a lot of out-of

18

state truckers that are not currently covered.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'd like to know the text you

That was For -- for preemption, the text

of the current statute that you rely on.
MR. STEWART:

The text of the current statute is

10

set forth at page 82 of the appendix to the certiorari

11

petition in Mid-Con, and it's now 49 U.S.C. 14504(b).

12

the statute says, the first sentence, the requirement of a

13

State that a motor carrier providing transportation

14

subject to jurisdiction under subchapter 1 of chapter 135

15

-- and that refers to interstate transportation -

16

providing interstate transportation and providing

17

transportation in that State must register with the State

18

is not an unreasonable burden on transportation referred

19

to in section 13501.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. STEWART:

And

13501 deals just with SSRS.

No.

13501 is the provision that

22

-- that defines the general regulatory jurisdiction of the

23

Department of Transportation and the Surface

24

Transportation Board.

25

agencies have general regulatory jurisdiction over

transportation.

that be permissible?

12

MR. STEWART:

Well, as long as the -- again, to

14

of the current statute is that subsection (2) is imposed

interstate commerce.

17

extra -

18

And if Michigan reduced to $90 the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I'm not saying -- they reduced

19

to $90 the plating fee, but then they enacted a new $10

fee specifically designed to comply with the statute.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. STEWART:

As long as Could they do that?

As long as they were still

said only -- only Michigan-plated vehicles pay the $90.

2

Everybody else -- everybody -- and everybody also pays the

3

$10.

4

MR. STEWART:

As long as that $90 fee was

5

imposed not just on Michigan-plated vehicles generally,

6

but specifically on Michigan-plated vehicles that operate

7

entirely in interstate commerce, we would say that's

8

preempted because our reading of the statute is that

9

basically Congress has said there's a severe limit on what

10

you can do to interstate carriers that you don't do to

11

intrastate carriers.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Where does it say that?

Let -

13

let me come back to the -- to the section of the statute

14

you're quoting.

15

that it's not an unreasonable burden when the State

registration is completed under standards of the Secretary

May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?
Briefly.

The State doesn't argue that this

registration was completed in accordance with this

standard.

all because this is not the sort of registration

25

requirement that the statute speaks of.

It argues that the provision doesn't apply at

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

because it's imposed strictly on interstate carriers.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT DIGGES, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 03-1230

7
8
9

MR. DIGGES:

Thank you.

I'd like to just

briefly cover three points.
First, I believe that -- that is accurate to say

10

that the Solicitor General's position is returning us to

11

the pre-Complete Auto days of line-drawing, but more than

12

that, the Solicitor General's position is ignoring the

13

practical effect of these fees on taxpayers.

14

-- the citation to the Peddler v. Drummer line of cases

15

illustrates that.

I think the

16

The only difference between the Peddler cases

17

and the Drummer cases was that in the -- in the Nippert

18

case and -- and the Drummer case, they looked at the

19

practical effect on an out-of-state salesman and whether

20

that salesman would be discouraged by the $50 fee that was

21

being imposed from coming into the State.

22

case, they simply said that the fee fell on an essentially

23

local event, didn't look at the form of the fee, didn't

24

look at the form of the fee on the out-of-state salesman.

25

I don't think it can be disputed that to out-of-state -

In the Wagner

54
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that out-of-state salesmen would be equally discouraged

2

from coming into a State because a $50 fee or a $100 fee,

3

whether or not they're carrying the goods with them in at

4

that time or whether the goods are later mailed in.

5

So, again, I think it is returning to the line-

6

drawing issues, and really there is no test that is made as

7

to, after you -- you draw these lines, what the appropriate

8

test should be.

9

The second point is it -- with respect to the

10

administrative practicality of apportioning these fees.

11

The purpose of apportionment would not be, as in a highway

12

tax, to -- to show the amount of highway damage that was

13

done by a truck.

14

simply to show the extent of the taxpayer's level of

15

activity in the State.

16

tax in which we're trying to allocate the taxpayer's

17

activity to particular States, make sure that that

18

taxpayer is paying its fair share of the State's costs

19

with respect -- of the State's generic costs, in this

20

case, generic regulatory costs.

21

apportionment would be very easy.

22

The purpose of apportionment here is

It would be like a general revenue

So, again, I think that

As Justice Scalia said, the trucking industry is

23

willing to take the onus of this.

24

You could do it on number of loads.

25

lot -- a lot of ways.

We bill by the mile.
You could do it in a

And by apportioning the fee, you

55
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

eliminate the burden and you make the out-of-state

2

carrier, who would be otherwise prohibited from only

3

hauling a load or two -- he would then have the ability to

4

haul that load and -- and not be discriminated against.

5

The final area I'd like to talk about a little

6

bit is the need for additional -- the need for evidence in

7

this case.

8

there -- they -- they -- it was expressly said that there

9

was no need for evidence in the cases because in the

Again, in the Nippert and the Scheiner cases,

10

general average of instances, the out-of-state trucker

11

will always pay more than the in-state trucker.

12

And in answer to your question, Justice Stevens,

13

I think it was recognized in those cases that there would

14

be some exceptions to that rule.

15

out-of-state carriers that would operate more heavily in

16

the State than in-state carriers.

17

wasn't -- wasn't what was going to happen and the most

18

often, and that the average of instances, it would always

19

work to the disadvantage of the out-of-state carriers.

20

There would be a few

But that exception

And -- and the final point is that with respect

21

to evidence, you have here also a failure of internal

22

consistency test, and this Court has said a number of

23

times that failure internal -- of internal consistency is

24

not a test related -- it doesn't rely on specific facts

25

but it relies on hypotheticals.

56
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And in this instance, I think there's a very

2

clear failure of internal consistency.

3

there's a cumulative burden on an out-of-state trucker.

4

If a trucker wants to operate in intrastate commerce

5

around the country, it has to -- and just haul one load in

6

every State, it has to pay 48 times a $100 fee or pay

7

$4,800 in eligible -- in order to be eligible to haul in

8

all of those States.

9

to balkanize commerce, that that carrier is not going to

Like in Scheiner,

So that illustrates how that's going

10

be able to pay that kind of entrance fee nationwide.

11

that carrier will operate in less intrastate activities in

12

-- in only a few States or maybe none.

13

So

And again, we think that that defeats the

14

purpose.

15

the trucking industry, that they wanted to open it up to

16

out-of-state carriers to be able to augment their

17

interstate loads.
