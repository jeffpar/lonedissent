ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. KAPLAN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6
7

MR. KAPLAN:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

8

I received word that the Court is interested in

9

46 U.S.C. 801, and I intend to focus my attention on that

10
11

before I get into my argument.
46-801 is referred to as the Shipping Act, and

12

it was enacted in 1916 and the amendment in 1918.

13

time, the United States Government was involved in a war

14

and we were interested in developing the merchant marine

15

for purposes of transporting cargo, equipment, and people

16

back and forth.

17

fashioned after exactly 1 U.S.C. 3, but it had some

18

additional features involved, one of which was that a

19

vessel that was under construction was included as part of

20

the act, one of which was if the owner intended to use the

21

vessel for transportation, it was included.

22

no circumstances affecting a Jones Act claim because the

23

Jones Act requires, number one, a vessel in navigation and

24

it can't be on the dock or being under construction, and

25

if it was under construction, it wouldn't have a crew.

At that

And so the amendment that was filed was

It is under

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

So under the circumstances, with all due

2

respect, it is our judgment that we -- we would win on

3

both sides.

4

that act as well as under 1 U.S.C. 3.

5

this goes a little too far and not appropriate.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

10

MR. KAPLAN:

Is the Super Scoop

It is more than practically

capable, it actually is -- actually transports its
equipment and its personnel at work and its --

11
12

But we think that

practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?

The Super Scoop would indeed, qualify under

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Didn't it come from the west

-- did it come from the west coast originally?

13

MR. KAPLAN:

Indeed, it did.

It came through

14

the west coast, unmanned, however.

15

coast through the Panama, through the Gulf, up the east

16

coast, and, sir, if anything had occurred on that trip, that

17

-- that would have been considered a vessel.

18

it came in to Boston --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

However, when

But there was nobody on it in

that trip.

21

MR. KAPLAN:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It came from the west

Sorry.
There was nobody -- there was

no one on it --

MR. KAPLAN:

In fact, it's unmanned.

1
2

MR. KAPLAN:

There was nobody injured and

unmanned, yes, indeed.

3

But what -- what I'm saying is historically

4

there has never been a decision in which a dredge was not

5

considered a vessel until this case that we appear here

6

now.

7

Of course, I'm here to seek to have you overrule

8

the decision that was rendered.

9

are having a morass in the lower courts, and I'm here to

But more importantly, we

10

try and persuade this Court to establish, once and for

11

all, that there is a standard, that there is a definition

12

for the use of the word vessel under the Jones Act.

13

Now, in 1920, when the Jones Act was enacted,

14

there was no reference to the use of the word vessel, and

15

we know that when that happens, we have to seek to find

16

what was the meaning, what was the established meaning at

17

that time.

18

statutory law, and in addition we look to case law.

19

And the way we do that is to look first to

The statutory law is clear.

In 1873 in the

20

revised statutes it makes it very clear that section 3

21

describes a vessel is any watercraft that -- or other

22

artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used, for

23

transportation on water.

24

Court in 1907 tried the case of Ellis v. the United States

25

and did apply that revised statute and decided that the

With that standard in 1873, this

dredges that were working in the city of -- in the Boston

2

Harbor were indeed vessels and that the --

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, now, that -- that

definition, used or capable of being used -- right, now.

5

After one of the hurricanes, I saw a -- a

6

tugboat that had just been washed up on shore down in the

7

Gulf.

8

fitted that out like a -- like a diner, you know, a -- a

9

restaurant and they have staff in the diner and they're

What if somebody -- some enterprising person had

serving the meals off of this boat?

11

from the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland,

MR. KAPLAN:

However, this Court --

17

Now, the boat, apart

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It -- it goes to whether we

want to use, you know, section 3 as -- as our definition.

18

MR. KAPLAN:

This Court seemed to have focused

19

right on point in the cases of Cope in -- Cope was early,

20

1903, and in the case of Evansville in 1926 when they

21

added the two words, practically capable.

So they said it's not practically

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Is that what we would say

12

about all these gambling casino boats that are parked on

13

the side of the Mississippi River?

14

MR. KAPLAN:

Your Honor, these are a problematic

15

case, and the whole thing is determined on whether or not

16

it's in navigation.

17
18

If a vessel is --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. KAPLAN:

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

22

There

are lots of these gambling boats that are parked --

19

21

What's your answer?

If the --- along the side of the

river.
MR. KAPLAN:

If the gambling boat has lost its

23

ability to be in navigation, if it's affixed to the land,

24

if it has connections to the land, if it doesn't expect to

25

go into navigation, it is out of navigation.

It's owner

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has taken that vessel from a navigable vessel into out of

2

navigation.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then what is the standard

4

you use, the definition to use to get to that result?

5

this your practically point again?

6

MR. KAPLAN:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is

Say that again, please.
You've given us the answer.

8

What's the standard that you use to get to that answer?

9

Do you go back to the definition that it -- it cannot

10
11

practicably be used?
MR. KAPLAN:

Well, the standard that I'm seeking

12

to have the Court employ is 1 U.S.C., section 3, which

13

says, any -- a vessel is any watercraft or other

14

artificial contrivance used, or capable of being used --

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then -- and then the

16

riverboat -- it depends on how -- how permanently it's

17

affixed to the land.

18

It -- it can go anytime, but it stays there for 10 years.

19

MR. KAPLAN:

Suppose it stays there for 10 years.

If in fact it stays there for 10

20

years and it does not move, that's evidence that the owner

21

intended that vessel to lose its position in navigation.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So there's an intent component

to your test now?
MR. KAPLAN:

There -- there -- technically one

could say break the bonds that hold it to the dock and

8

then take it out and use it because once a vessel, always

this Court said --

The answer is no.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. KAPLAN:

According to this Court,

Mr. Kaplan?

-- when it's not practically

capable of doing it.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kaplan, you said two

8

things and I -- I'm wondering whether these are separate or

9

they're really one concept.

I thought your answer was

10

going to be to the boat that is used as a diner or to the

11

casino that's tied up to the land, that it's not in

12

navigation.

13

vessel, but it has to be in navigation to be covered by

14

the Jones Act.

15

something that's taken out of navigation would not qualify.

16

It may satisfy the 1 U.S.C. definition of

So I thought that's what you would --

MR. KAPLAN:

The answer is no.

It -- it does

17

not qualify if it's removed from navigation.

19

situation where that vessel is on the land, it is being

used as a completely different --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you say it is a vessel.

I

It's out

that, I take it, you do not wish us to adopt, or maybe you

do.

MR. KAPLAN:

I'm trying to establish that if

it's in navigation, then it is a vessel.

and it's out in the water so that the riverboat is the

vessel and presumably we've got seamen working on it.

3

MR. KAPLAN:

Justice Souter, if on that

4

situation where all they have to do is cast the lines off

5

and go out to sea, then of course it remains a vessel, and

6

it remains in navigation.

7

elements of the requirements.

8
9

And it is -- it fits all the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But if that --

So you're saying -- and I -- I

don't mean to disagree with you.

You're saying, yes,

10

there are going to be a few tough results under this

11

definition.

12

MR. KAPLAN:

There may be, but there's got to be

13

some practically capable influence that this Court has

14

already focused on to say whether that particular vessel

15

is practically capable of being in navigation.

16

out of navigation, it's never going to be back in

17

navigation, and there's nothing more that's going to

18

happen to that as a vessel, then of course it's no longer

19

a vessel that would qualify.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

If it's

So -- so what is -- I see the

21

First Circuit as trying to grapple with the very question

22

you're raising, which is I think difficult.

23

MR. KAPLAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

let section 3 apply.

Yes.
Of course, it seems to me fine,

No problem so far with me.

But that

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is so broadly stated that if you read it literally, my

2

garage door is a boat or a vessel because, after all, it's

3

capable of being used in navigation, if worst came to

4

worst.

5

that absurd result.

6

That's what they were trying to do, and you got caught up

7

in it.

8
9

And now you're trying to narrow it to get out of
Well, so did the First Circuit.

But that's -- so -- so what -- that's why I
think we're struggling with the words, and -- and perhaps

10

practically -- if you mean by practically that it is not

11

practically capable of navigation, even though it really

12

is, if it just hasn't been used for navigation for a long,

13

long time and has connections to the land like Jimmy's

14

Harborside probably or -- or --

15

MR. KAPLAN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KAPLAN:

But is -- are those the words?

Like the establishments from the -What?

-- pier 4, yes.
Yes, yes, or one like that.
Do we need some

20

other words as well?

21

practically capable has a technical meaning here that it

22

means if there's a close to permanent connection to the

23

land, it doesn't apply?

24
25

MR. KAPLAN:

We say practically capable but

Justice Breyer, we're talking

primarily of Jones Act.

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. KAPLAN:

Yes.

Jones Act requires a relationship

between the worker and the vessel.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

So --

So could we say -- could we say

5

that, as well, it must be unlike my garage door?

6

must be a -- a structure that normally would have a crew

or that -- a significant amount of the time.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So that would be the answer to

2

the riverboat problem.

3

riverboat is capable simply of being let go in the water

4

by casting off lines, the riverboat is a vessel.

5

don't have to worry about turning all the -- the croupiers

6

and the waiters into seamen because they're not

7

contributing to the transportation function of the vessel.

You'd say sure, if the -- if the

So then the --

There is a safeguard between the

13

vessel and whether a person qualifies as a Jones Act

14

seaman on that vessel.

So you -- you think that the

person who operates the dredge, since he's not navigating

the vessel, is not covered by the Jones Act?

MR. KAPLAN:

No, but --

They don't hand me any money, I'll

4

What I'm trying to establish here is that there

5

really is a distinction between the law applicable to

6

whether or not there is a vessel, and I'm suggesting that

7

1 U.S.C. clearly describes what a vessel is and should be

8

for Jones Act purposes.

The second part of the issue is whether or not

the individual qualifies and is warranted to have the

11

Jones Act coverage.

12

coverage, we know, through Wilander and through Chandris,

13

this Court has established some very sensible and good

14

standards by which a person can or cannot be a -- a Jones

15

Act seaman.

So as to the vessel -- as to this

16

Now the only thing that's necessary is we have

17

to round the circle up to determine what is a vessel for

18

Jones Act purposes.

19

1 U.S.C. seems to satisfy it.

It's important to note that in this particular

20

case this is a Coast Guard-certified, inspected vessel.

This vessel is -- carries -- it has a 1290 ton itself and

22

it carries cargo of 466 ton.

24

When it goes to work, the way in which it moves is as

25

follows.

It is -- it has navigation

It has to be ballasted.

It has to be load-lined.

The tugs take the anchors out 50 feet.

Now, as

by order of the Coast Guard, because it is exposed to all

the weather and navigation problems that exist in the --

in Boston Harbor, because the risks are inherent in this

Justice Ginsburg, I take it the reason that the

Justice Scalia that I thought what was an answer isn't

recommended, has a rather specialized meaning where we get

I think the -- the -- you look at

the physical characteristics and the surrounding

circumstances of any type of watercraft, and if it's out

12

13

What I think is bothering -- what was bothering the First

they have a high center of gravity because of those

The Government has taken the position,

as has petitioner, in their briefs and here today that

11

it's still in navigation if it can be used.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but I think what the

13

Government has said is that though it's in navigation, we

have a case that says that the -- that the seaman's

connection to the ship has to be related to the

functioning of the ship in navigation.

18

does in the course of its navigation, and a dredge

operator does that.

MR. CONNELLY:

He doesn't have to

Well, I don't think a dredge

operator does that any more than the waiter on the casino.

movement of the dredge was incidental.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Should we clarify that?

Because I don't -- I didn't read the case saying what

8

Justice Scalia just said or what you -- what it says is

that a seaman must have a connection to a substantial --

MR. CONNELLY:

MR. CONNELLY:

Well, again, Your Honor, if -- if

2

in navigation means what it should mean, which is an

3

instrument for transportation or commerce over navigable

4

waters, and not simply as the petitioner and the

5

Government want it to mean that anything that once might

6

have been in navigable waters and stays in navigable

7

waters and isn't mothballed is still in navigation -- if

8

it means what it should mean, then that's something I

9

think the First Circuit is -- was trying to get to anyway.

10

They -- they were looking at it in terms of vessel status,

11

vessel in navigation versus just in navigation.

12

they were trying to get there and that's why they used

13

what is really a -- a temporal look and looked at what was

14

the business use.

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, exactly.

They --

And -- and in

16

Chandris, this Court rejected the snapshot approach to

Well, Your Honor, there -- there

are always -- and this is answering Justice Ginsburg's

7

question earlier as well.

8

difficult situations where some people, doing the exact

9

same work, using the same equipment on the same structure,

There are always going to be

10

some are covered and some are not, a situation where one

11

has the requisite connection 30 or 40 percent to a vessel,

12

the other person doing the same work next to him only has

13

10 percent.

14

One is covered.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, but it might be much

15

simpler to rely on 1 U.S. Code, section 3 and our -- our

16

definition, as we've described it there, and then deal

17

with other situations within the framework of the

18

definition of seaman and the other issues that arise.

19

it seems like the First Circuit went backwards from

20

Chandris back to Giovanni which basically had been

21

rejected.

22

And

So that's the concern.
MR. CONNELLY:

that if 1 U.S.C., section 3 is adopted, then every vessel

-- in several cases that Congress left it to the Court to

5

decide which persons are -- should be granted Jones Act

6

14

also point out that the petitioner is a recent convert to

15

this position, and it -- it hasn't been followed in the

16

17

where a lot of circuit judges have stated section 3 should

I have never thought of that,

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. CONNELLY:

Your Honor, I think in that in

that situation, there are -- there can be vessels involved

15

with transportation, getting back to the Cope case and

other cases, where there -- it's -- it's a barge being

We're not disputing

I don't think it needs to have a captain and crew

But you hit the nail on the head, Your Honor,

21

and that's -- that's where the First Circuit was befuddled

22

in -- in trying to come up with a regional -- reasonable

23

test because they're dealing with this situation where it

24

seemed like everything is a vessel in navigation.

25

yet, that doesn't serve Congress' intent of only persons

Act.

MR. CONNELLY:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Correct, Your Honor.
And this is the -- the only

8

purpose of the vessel inquiry that we're involved in is to

9

-- to say is this person within one injury compensation

11

MR. CONNELLY:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Correct.
Now why, in making that

13

inquiry, should the courts go off on their own and be

14

inventive and come up with a definition when Congress has

15

given a definition that can be used by default?

16

Congress thinks it should be other than the general

17

definition they have provided, Congress can also do that.

18

But in the meantime, why should the courts go creating

19

definitions instead of using the one that's right there in

20

the statute book?

21

MR. CONNELLY:

If

practically capable.

MR. CONNELLY:

Your Honor -- and I realize that

14

is what Justice Scalia said earlier.

15

petitioner, as he stated as he was standing here not too

16

many minutes ago, was that they seek to have the Court

17

employ 1 U.S.C., section 3, not the Evansville change to

18

that section.

19

it's in both of their briefs, that Evansville did change 1

Congress says so.

definition of vessel.

left it, of course, to the courts to decide who is

entitled to the Jones Act status.

Obviously, a compromise was reached

They limited it to that and

8

If I may have a second, Your Honor.

9

The term vessel can and often has had a

different meaning for the Jones Act, which this Court has

11

stated is a vessel in navigation, than it does with the

12

Longshore and Harbor Workers Act.

13

filed on behalf of the petitioner, Mr. Hillsman writes

14

that the lower court unanimously -- unanimously -- have

decided that the definition of vessel for purposes of the

Longshore Act is much, much more inclusive than it is for

the Jones Act, and it has worked perfectly fine.

However, as this Court saw in Gizoni, a perfect

that there are always cases and will be dealing with the
