ORAL ARGUMENT OF COURTLAND REICHMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. REICHMAN:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:

10

On occasion a prior conviction that's used to

11

enhance a Federal sentence turns out to have been obtained

12

in violation of the Constitution.

13

the procedure for handling those challenges in Custis and

14

15

circumstances, the facts that would show the prior

16

conviction is unconstitutional do not support a claim

17

either at sentencing or under section 2255.

18

This Court addressed

21

the State court vacatur is the fact supporting the claim

22

for three reasons.

23

It's the key part of the fourth
In this case,

First, as expressed, Daniels made clear that the

24

underlying facts, those facts that you use for the

25

challenge to the prior conviction, do not support a claim

under 2255, leaving the vacatur as the operative fact.
Second, the plain meaning of the word fact

3

encompasses a vacatur just like courts often refer to

4

convictions as historical facts.

5

And third, there's no reason to dispense with

6

the plain language of the statute to serve policy ends.

7

The policies animating both AEDPA and section 2255 are

8

served by the rule advanced by petitioner.

9

petitioner's rule will be a lot more straightforward in

10

And moreover,

application.

11

Let me -­

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

One little complication here.

13

Under 2255, even if that applies in this situation, it

14

does establish a 1-year statute of limitations.

15

MR. REICHMAN:

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Right?

Correct.
And subsection (4) of that

section says:

20

requirement that the defendant seek State relief on a

21

timely basis?

22

before going back to the State and seeking a vacatur?

23

does that due diligence requirement apply to the efforts

24

to get State action?

25

the date on which the facts supporting the

Now, is that a

Can the defendant just wait indefinitely

MR. REICHMAN:

Or

Well, there -- there are several

Page 4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

levels to the response.

2

Let me work through them.

The first is that the petitioner's position

3

relies on a straightforward reading of the statute, and we

4

think that the due diligence requirement is satisfied when

5

the vacatur is discovered through the exercise of due

6

diligence.

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but you're not being

8

responsive to my question.

9

to the State courts and got this -- the earlier

10

convictions vacated.

Here the defendant did go back

Right?

11

MR. REICHMAN:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But I asked you, is there any

13

requirement that the defendant act promptly in going back

14

to the State to get the vacaturs?

15

MR. REICHMAN:

16

the fourth trigger.

There's no requirement in -- in

However -­

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

18

itself speaks of diligence.

19

Well, except that the statute

Now, can the -- suppose he's been given a very

20

long Federal sentence and part of that is the result of

21

prior State convictions.

22

before going back to the State to seek to overturn those

23

earlier State convictions.

24

he act promptly?

25

MR. REICHMAN:

And suppose he waits 10 years

Is there no requirement that

And to elaborate on the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but the Federal statute

says -- it puts a burden of diligence on the defendant.

7

MR. REICHMAN:

Reading the plain language, we

8

think that burden of diligence applies to discovering the

9

vacatur.

10

If you -- if a vacatur is a fact -- and I think

the Government has all but -­

11
12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How -- how could one not

discover the vacatur?

13

Here's my problem.

I -- I frankly don't think

14

the text of -- of (4), part (4), really fits comfortably

15

with either your interpretation or the Government's.

16

says the date on which the facts supporting the claim

17

could have been discovered through the exercise of

18

diligence.

19

It

Well, as you point out in your brief, the fact

20

supporting the claim here is simply the elimination of the

21

prior conviction, the vacatur of the prior conviction.

22

That's the fact supporting the claim, not the facts which

23

led to the vacatur, but it's the vacatur.

24

the Government's case a little uncomfortable.

25

So that makes

But it seems to me you have to acknowledge that

Page 6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

your case is pretty uncomfortable when you -- when you

2

talk about discovering the fact of the -- of the vacatur.

3

I mean, it's a matter of public record.

4

discover a -- a public record?

5

due diligence to discover a public record?

6

seems to me it's -- it's automatically -- isn't the

7

vacatur always served on the -- on the person whose

8

conviction is vacated?

9

seeks the vacation?

How does one

How -- how could you need

Isn't it always that person who

So what sense does it make to talk

10

about his discovering that particular fact?

11

me it makes no sense.

12

I mean, it

It seems to

So you're left with -- with two competing

13

interpretations, both of which have some textual problems.

14

I'm inclined to think you take the one that makes sense,

15

given the purpose of the statute, and the purpose of the

16

statute, as Justice O'Connor has suggested, is to make

17

people bring up their claims promptly.

18

purpose would -- would be served by the Government's rule

19

and not by yours.

20

statute of limitation, this -- this Federal requirement of

21

due diligence goes begging.

22
23
24
25

And -- and that

You say unless the State has some

What's -- what's your response to that?

You

really think -- especially about the discover.
MR. REICHMAN:

I do and here's why, first,

starting with the language before I turn to the policy

Page 7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

side of your question.

2

On the language, paragraph (4), the fourth

3

trigger, is broad language that was meant to cover a

4

variety of circumstances, things from ineffective

5

assistance of counsel, to Brady violations, to vacaturs.

6

I'll grant you that if Congress only intended the vacatur

7

situation to be covered by paragraph (4), we might wonder

8

why they chose those particular words, but we know they

9

didn't intend this one circumstance.

10

I think the Government's position as to discover

11

boils down to this.

12

when could the vacatur have been discovered through

13

reasonable diligence, is easy, the answer must be wrong.

14

And we don't believe that to be the case.

15

you can easily ask when could the vacatur have been

16

discovered through the exercise of reasonable -­

17

Because the answer to the question,

JUSTICE BREYER:

We think that

And when it could have been

18

discovered I guess if he had taken due diligence and gone

19

and made the motion within a year, at least, of his having

20

been convicted in the Federal court.

21

I mean, I don't see how you can have it both

22

ways.

You want us to read that phrase very broadly to

23

include under the word facts something like a vacatur, and

24

then it sounds to me you're being very literal and

25

linguistic when you say that due diligence to find the

Page 8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

facts shouldn't mean what I would take it as ordinarily

2

meaning, that -- that you have to, when you had a chance,

3

go back and generate this fact.

4

MR. REICHMAN:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

I -­
I don't see how you can do

both, in other words.
MR. REICHMAN:

I think we can.

I think both the

8

interpretations of each of those contested words are

9

strict interpretations right within the plain meaning.

10

And our case can boil down to asking whether there's

11

something wrong with my English language when I say, on

12

what day could the vacatur have been discovered through

13

the exercise of due diligence.

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. REICHMAN:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

On the pure English language,

it's not exactly a fact.

16

18

It's -­

determination.

Well -­
I mean, it's a legal

We usually separate law from fact.

MR. REICHMAN:

And -- and as we point out in our

20

brief, there's nothing -- in this context in particular, a

21

vacatur is like a conviction.

22

is -- is commonly referred to by the court.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's a fact, you know, that

Well, just so that I understand

24

your argument then, going back to Justice O'Connor's

25

question, if you get a long sentence, can you sit there

Page 9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

for 10 years, then initiate the process to get the earlier

2

conviction vacated and then say, as soon as it is, with

3

due diligence I'm here at the courthouse because, although

4

I waited 10 years, I have brought my 2255 as soon as I

5

learned that my earlier sentence had been vacated?

6

answer to that question, I take it, is yes, he satisfies

7

the statute.

8
9

MR. REICHMAN:

Your

He satisfies the statute, but I

need to point out something that I think is critical to

10

understanding this question.

At the end of the day, we're

11

talking about at most six States where this might be at

12

issue.

13

limitations.

14

about a rule -­

The rest of them either have laches or statutes of

15

And these are small States.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We're talking

Okay, but in -- in six States,

16

I would have thought that, A, the due diligence language,

17

together with the general obvious policy of AEDPA, to get

18

this over with, would have made it very difficult to

19

conclude that he can sit there without doing anything for

20

10 years.

21

MR. REICHMAN:

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23
24
25

Well, I -­
Maybe it's only in six States,

but six States count.
MR. REICHMAN:

They do count.

But it ties into

the response -- the second part of Justice Scalia's

Page 10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

question is, isn't finality served?

Isn't that what AEDPA

2

is all about?

3

that they propose will serve finality in the vast majority

4

of cases because in the vast majority of cases, you're

5

talking about claims that will have no merit in State

6

court.

7

State court habeas process before the 1 year in the first

8

paragraph, these petitioners will file placeholder

9

petitions in Federal court and have them held while they

We don't believe that the Government's rule

But because it's very difficult to complete the

10

finish their State court review.

11

you're talking about these six States, maybe 10 guys a

12

year, you're going to cause, as the Brackett court on

13

remand said, thousands of placeholder petitions to be

14

filed, and you're needlessly extending all of those cases

15

so that you cut off the rights for maybe 10 people who

16

happen to be in these States.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So what you're doing is

All right.

Here's -- here's a

18

simple way of looking at it.

The minute that you're

19

convicted and you are subject to the enhanced sentence

20

based on a prior conviction, the obligation of due

21

diligence begins.

22

That's the point at which you've got to file your petition

23

so that you can come into court with reasonable

24

promptness, if not by the sentencing hearing itself, as

25

soon afterwards as the State process allows you.

You can't sit there for 10 years.

Page 11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

That would be a simple due diligence point.

It

2

wouldn't involve placeholder petitions, and it would get

3

things concluded with reasonable promptness.

4

that a way of -- of applying the statute?

5

MR. REICHMAN:

Why isn't

Because if you were going to be

6

strict about it -- and -- and I'm not sure I understand

7

all of the parameters of the hypothetical -- in -­

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Easy.

The minute he's

9

convicted, the State has charged him and -- and -- or his

10

-- by some charging document has made clear that there is

11

going to be an invocation of a prior conviction for an

12

enhanced sentence.

13

later offense in which that sentencing possibility has

14

been raised, he has an obligation to go into the State

15

court and start the process of -- of getting his earlier

16

conviction vacated.

17

As soon as he is convicted of the

Easy.

MR. REICHMAN:

If Mr. Johnson had done that in

18

this case, he still would have missed the 1-year statute

19

of limitations.

20

Circuit case by Judge Wilkinson, he still would have

21

missed the 1-year statute of limitations.

22

If Mr. Gadsen had done that in the Fourth

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But he would have acted with

23

due diligence and he would have had as -- I suppose, a

24

very powerful argument, which -- which the Government

25

apparently would accept, for -- for tolling.

Page 12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. REICHMAN:

For equitable tolling?

Well, I

2

don't know that the Government would accept equitable

3

tolling.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, as I understood Justice

5

Souter's question, it is the alternate that the Government

6

said.

7

alternate argument sounds to me just like what Justice

8

Souter put to you, that is, he has to move diligently to

9

challenge those underlying convictions, that he cannot

The Government puts forward two arguments, and its

10

challenge in Federal court because of -- was it -- Curtis

11

and Daniels.

12

Why isn't that an -- an accommodation of what we

13

know was the concern of the Federal court -- of the -- of

14

the Congress that people act diligently?

15

2255 wasn't framed with Curtis and Daniels in mind.

16

isn't any indication that the drafters of 2255 were aware

17

of this peculiar situation where you can't make the

18

challenge in Federal court, you must go back to the State

19

forum.

20

It happens that

But we do know they were concerned with diligence.
MR. REICHMAN:

Well, AEDPA was enacted after

21

Custis was decided and I think we presume that the

22

Congress was aware of the precedent, but the -­

23

There

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Now, wasn't -- didn't Mr.

24

Johnson here wait a couple of years after the Federal

25

sentencing before he tried to go back to the State courts?

1

MR. REICHMAN:

2

The -- the -- our answer -­

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

4

Yes, he did.

I'm not sure that was a

diligent sort of a -- an effort.

5

MR. REICHMAN:

We believe it was diligent within

6

the -- the fourth trigger because, again, we rely on the

7

plain language.

8

address your question and Justice Souter's question, is

9

that we don't believe -- we believe this is engrafting a

And the -- the fall-back position, to

10

whole different statutory scheme on top of the one that we

11

have.

12

all right, let's interpret the statute or rewrite it to

13

say that we're going to trigger the date on when the

14

vacatur could have been obtained, not when it could have

15

been discovered.

16

well, let's give him a year from the time of the Federal

17

sentencing.

18

back to the time of the original conviction in State

19

court.

20

Then they say then we'll add a provision that tolls during

21

the pendency of State habeas, and then we'll add another

22

1-year statute of limitations on top of that after the

23

vacatur is obtained.

24

plain language, we have two 1-year statutes of limitations

25

with a tolling provision in between, the type of tolling

The fall-back position of the Government is to say,

And to do that, what they're saying is,

So -- or -- or maybe even earlier, dating

So they add that 1-year statute of limitations.

So we end up with -- instead of the

Page 14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

provision that is, by the way, in section 2244.

2

We believe that petitioner's interpretation,

3

although the answer is not difficult, it -- it is the

4

correct answer.

5

have been discovered through the exercise of due

6

diligence?

7

On what date did the -- could the vacatur

And the answer I think was -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then you -- you have to

8

concede that you are watering down almost to nothing any

9

due diligence requirement because on your reading of the

10

statute, there isn't -- there isn't any such requirement.

11

MR. REICHMAN:

Well, we think that that is -­

12

I'll -- I'll say that there's no -- we don't believe that

13

there is a requirement in the Federal statute, in

14

agreement with -- with your statement, to exercise

15

diligence and seeking the vacatur.

16

that is a necessary consequence of the administrative

17

decision that this Court made in Custis and Daniels to

18

send these back to the State court.

19

But we believe that

It -- it could have been the case that these

20

were all challenged at sentencing, and in fact, I think

21

that was the prevailing practice before Custis, that they

22

were challenged at sentencing.

23

followed on by Daniels made a different decision, and I

24

think a good one.

25

challenges back to the State and that inevitably will

But Custis and then

It made the decision to wrap these

Page 15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

result in delays as it works it way through the State.

2

The rationale for the Court's decision makes

3

perfect sense when you apply it to this context.

4

the key concerns, it seems to me, that the Court had was

5

that if you allow these Federal challenges that are

6

outside the State statute of limitations, then it's very

7

possible the State is not going to have the records

8

necessary to defend it because they wouldn't be expected

9

to keep records outside of their statute of limitations.

10

One of

And that's simply not the case here because

11

these challenges, under the petitioner's rule, would be

12

within the State statutes of limitations, and as this

13

Court recognized in Daniels, the States have a powerful

14

interest in defending their convictions and that powerful

15

interest, it seems to me, would lead them to preserve the

16

records necessary to maintain their convictions.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you make the argument or is

18

it implicit in your argument -- maybe you don't have this

19

concern -- that if you imply a Federal due diligence

20

standard on your duty to vacate the State conviction, that

21

it's just too burdensome on the petitioner who has to

22

begin fighting the vacatur battle at the same time that he

23

has only 1 year to complete his habeas with reference to

24

the other challenges to his conviction?

25

MR. REICHMAN:

That is not something that we've

Page 16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

argued in the briefs.

2

especially when you're talking about a pro se petitioner.

3

It -- it, no doubt, is true

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask?

You mentioned -- I

4

just want to be sure I understand your point -- that there

5

are only six States that are really affected by this rule.

6

Is that because all the other States have State

7

limitations periods that require the prisoner to act

8

promptly?

9
10
11

MR. REICHMAN:

Limitations period by statute or

they have a laches principle that would limit the ability.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

So that the -- the

12

hypothetical of the prisoner waiting 10 years to challenge

13

the State conviction can only arise in a few States.

14

that right?

15

MR. REICHMAN:

Is

That's right, and from what I can

16

tell from the Department of Justice statistics, there are

17

even fewer number of convictions in those States, and best

18

I can back-of-the-envelope it, we're talking about maybe I

19

think less than 10 people per year.

20
21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In those -- in those six

States or those few States --

22

MR. REICHMAN:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- have those States all made

24

clear they'd say we will never apply laches, or is it just

25

the case that there have never -- there's never been an

Page 17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

instance where the laches issue was presented to them?
MR. REICHMAN:

The latter is more accurate.

I'm

-- I'm -- I was trying not to overreach, but I went with

the cases that States that were clear that laches would

5

apply either by statute or by case law.

6

And why this becomes particularly important to

7

me is because we think the petitioner's rule serves the

8

ends of the Federal court overall, especially when you're

9

talking about finality because it seems to be the tail

10

wagging the dog, in a way, to have a rule that cuts off

11

the possibility of the 10-year scenario for these few

12

cases and then causes thousands of placeholder petitions

13

to be filed and managed.

14

know, average non-merits dismissal, we're talking about

15

roughly 260 days.

16

unnecessary, particularly to bring it back, when we think

17

that in light of Custis and Daniels, the plain language

18

takes us all the way there.

that he's pro se and has limited education.

14

I want to point out one thing that -- that I

think is important perhaps, if -- if the Court were to go

extent that we are concerned with equitable tolling and -­

the process is familiar to the court because it -- it's

what happens when you have these pro se petitioners.

4

The important thing in this case, we believe,

5

the core concern is with the plain language of the

statute.

7

underlying facts to a State court vacatur do not support a

paragraph (4) to say that, okay, then the operative fact

Because Daniels in substance said, the

And this case -- it's a very real concern

because without the prior convictions that were later

vacated, Mr. Johnson would have a roughly 7-year sentence.

15

can conclude now were unconstitutional -- added 8 more

18

of course, the sentencing scheme depends on reliability of

the information used for purposes of sentencing, and

20

that's why Congress chose to enact the fourth paragraph

opportunity to correct unreliable information when it came

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN HIMMELFARB

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6
7

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner's State court habeas corpus petition,

8

which challenged his guilty plea on a ground available at

9

the time of the plea, was filed nearly 9 years after the

10

plea was entered and nearly 2 years after a subsequent

11

Federal conviction became final.

12

nevertheless, contends that the challenge to his Federal

13

sentence was timely under AEDPA's 1-year statute of

14

limitations because it was filed within a year of the date

15

on which his State conviction was vacated.

16

interpretation, which enables a defendant to extend the

17

limitation period for challenging his Federal conviction

18

by delaying a challenge to his State conviction, is

19

fundamentally at odds with the statutory text, the

20

statutory purpose, and the overall statutory scheme.

21

Petitioner,

That

To begin with the statutory scheme, under clause

22

(1) of AEDPA's limitation provision, the presumptive rule

23

is that a defendant wishing to -- to collaterally

24

challenge a Federal conviction has a year from the date on

25

which the conviction becomes final.

Page 21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Clauses (2), (3) -- (2), (3), and (4) create

2

exceptions to that general rule when a prisoner is unable

3

to comply with the rule in clause (1) for reasons beyond

4

his control.

5

interpretation is that it would excuse compliance with the

6

presumptive rule in clause (1) for a reason that is not

7

beyond his control, a failure to exercise diligence in

8

challenging his State conviction.

9
10
11
12
13

The fundamental flaw in petitioner's

Petitioner's interpretation is also inconsistent
with the statutory purpose of the limitation provision.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, are you saying that (4)

is inapplicable?
MR. HIMMELFARB:

No, Justice Kennedy.

We agree

14

that (4) is applicable in a case like this.

15

that our position is that petitioner's interpretation of

16

it is wrong.

17

how paragraph 6(4) would apply in a case like this.

18

It's just

We offer two alternative interpretations of

Before I get to them, I'd like to respond to a

19

question that you asked when petitioner's counsel was

20

standing up here, and that had to do with the difficulty

21

of getting everything that needed to be done done in the

22

space of a year.

23

It's critical to keep in mind that in the

24

typical case of this type, the factual basis for the State

25

claim is going to available at the time of the State

Page 22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

guilty or trial, which in almost every case is going to be

2

years before the Federal conviction becomes final.

3

since the limitation provision under AEDPA runs from the

4

latest of the four dates, in a typical case a defendant is

5

going to have many years to seek the vacatur of a State

6

conviction and he'll have up until a year after his

7

Federal conviction becomes final to challenge it.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And

But do you agree with your

opponent that most States have their own limitations

may well be true, Justice Stevens, but laches is a much

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It -- it does seem to me that

the State has a greater interest than the Federal

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Government does in the finality of its own convictions,

2

and so the State would be the primary guardian of

3

preventing dilatory tactics, it would seem to me.

4

MR. HIMMELFARB:

The -- the State does have an

5

interest.

The problem is that when there's a delay in

6

filing a challenge to a State conviction, one of two

7

things can be happen -- can happen, and the cases bear

8

this out.

9

perfectly diligent and wants to defend the conviction but,

10

because of the lapse of time, can't because the requisite

11

records aren't available.

12

of these cases is that because the State sentence has been

13

served by the time it's challenged in cases of this type,

14

the State prosecutor doesn't have the same kind of

15

incentive -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

recognize that that's going to be the ultimate issue, but

your point was, oh, well, the State is powerless because

the prosecutor might not have the records.

9

MR. HIMMELFARB:

The States

Justice Kennedy, we're not

10

saying that States are powerless, and there are many

11

cases, probably the majority of them, where States do

12

diligently defend their own convictions in cases of this

13

type.

14

are many cases where either they're not able to or they're

15

unwilling to because the State sentence has long since

16

been served.

Unfortunately, the reported cases show that there

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Himmelfarb -­

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, in this case now, the

19

22

Isn't that so?

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Don't we accept that as a

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But he did succeed.

And then

2

we have to look at whether the petitioner has complied

3

with section 2255 of AEDPA.

4

(4), do we not, in this case to answer that?

5

MR. HIMMELFARB:

And so we look to subpart

Well, in a case of this type,

6

you would have to look to both subpart (1) and subpart (4)

7

and determine which one gives him more time, and whichever

8

one gives him more time is the one that applies.

9

that 6(1) applies because under 6(4) he waited far too

10

We think

long to challenge his State conviction.

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, that's possible, but

12

you also question whether the vacatur can be a fact under

13

subsection (4).

MR. HIMMELFARB:

We don't really, Justice

O'Connor.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's -- go on.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Would -- would you comment on

10

-- on one difficulty I have with what, I take it, is your

11

preferred position of measuring due diligence from -- as I

12

understand it, from the -- the date at which the State

13

conviction became final?

14

Most of these -- I think it is fair to say that

15

most of the State convictions, like most convictions in -­

16

in general, are going to rest on -- on guilty pleas.

17

just is not realistic to assume that Congress assumed a

18

due diligence system which was going to require a State

19

defendant immediately to start a collateral attack on a

20

guilty plea.

21

reasons for the collateral attack that seemed strong and

22

worthwhile, he wouldn't have been entering the guilty

23

plea.

24
25

It

I mean, if -- if there -- if there were

And it seems to me that if we're going to
measure due diligence from the date of conviction, most

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

convictions resting on pleas, as a practical matter under

2

your system, a conviction that rests on a plea is never

3

going to be subject to a timely challenge for purposes of

4

applying 2255.

have I missed something?

6

Is -- is that a fair comment, or have I -­

MR. HIMMELFARB:

No.

We -- we disagree, Justice

7

Souter.

And if I could, I'd like to say a little bit

8

about the -- the proposal you made when petitioner's

9

counsel was up here about when the diligence could be

10

measured from.

And I think your suggestion was that it

11

could be measured from the time of the Federal conviction

12

or -­

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes.

14

MR. HIMMELFARB:

-- perhaps the time that

15

Federal charges are brought because at that time, that's

16

when the defendant has the incentive to -- to challenge

17

the State conviction.

18

interpretation to the one offered by petitioner.

19

We obviously prefer that

We think the two that we offer are better than

20

that one for a couple of reasons.

21

think that our two -­

22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The first is that we

Well, would you comment

23

specifically on your preferred position which starts at

24

the very -- as I understand it, starts at the earliest

25

date, which would be the date of the State conviction?

Page 28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's right.

We think that's

2

consistent with the text because the diligence has to be

3

connected in some way to the facts supporting the claim,

4

and we think you could take the view that in a case of

5

this type, particularly given the diligence requirement,

6

the facts supporting the claim either means the facts

7

supporting the State claim or it means the vacatur of the

8

State conviction.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but isn't it -- I guess my

10

problem is isn't -- isn't it a sense -- isn't your

11

argument for a sense of diligence which is really other­

12

wordly?

13

upon his plea becomes final, it simply is unrealistic to

14

expect that any defendant would have an incentive to

15

attack that conviction.

16

to me, of -- of your position, your preferred position, is

17

if -- if diligence is measured from that moment, that no

18

defendant will ever be diligent because no defendant will

19

ever have an incentive at that point to be diligent.

At the moment the defendant's conviction based

20

And -- and the result, it seems

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, Justice Souter, the -- we

21

think that there's a -- a textual problem with the

22

interpretation you're offering because it doesn't tie

23

diligence to facts supporting a claim.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, how about the one you're

Before you tell me why mine is bad, tell me why

yours does not suffer the -- the -- at least I think, the

2

objection that I've -- I've raised?

3

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Because it avoids the problem

4

that you could have a Federal conviction long after, years

5

or a decade or a more after, the State conviction.

6

-- on your view, you would not be -- the -- the petitioner

7

would not be required to challenge a State conviction for

8

a decade or more until after -­

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's -- that's right.

And on

But

10

why is the requirement on your reading to challenge it

11

promptly after it is entered in these plea situations, not

12

a just totally unrealistic requirement that will never be

13

met and will result in a consequence that all State

14

convictions, resting upon pleas, will be, in effect,

15

insulated from later collateral attack when -- under -­

16

for purpose of 2255?

17

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Justice Souter, an argument

18

along those lines was actually raised in Daniels itself

19

and rejected by the Court.

20

said is that whatever the incentives may be at the time of

21

the State conviction, the remedies are available, the

22

procedures are available.

23

avail himself of those remedies and procedures, at a

24

minimum he will know that so long as his State conviction

25

remains on the books, if he goes out and commits another

And essentially what the Court

And if a defendant does not

Alderson Reporting Company

crime, he runs a risk that he will be subject to an

2

enhanced sentence based on the fact that he's committed

3

the prior crime.

4

We think the same --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you say we're all stuck with

6

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think that -­

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You don't mind, but -- if -- if

5

that.

8

you think -- if you think there's anything to my

9

objection, you're in effect saying, too late.

10

MR. HIMMELFARB:

I think that the arguments

11

against your objection weigh in favor of our

12

interpretation.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not sure I agree

14

with your argument, but I suppose one answer to Justice

15

Souter is that you get the longer of (1) or (4), so that

16

you would always get at least 1 year.

17

State conviction was 10 years prior to the Federal

18

conviction and he waited and did nothing, I take it, he

19

still has 1 year because he gets the longer of the two

20

provisions.

If the -- if the

21

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's right, Justice Kennedy.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is right?

Because I thought

23

that Justice Souter provided that, but you don't because

24

if you're relegated to (4) -- let's say it becomes final

25

quickly.

If you're relegated to (4), what you're saying

Page 31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

is the date on which the facts supporting the claim could

2

have been discovered, if this is a conviction that took

3

place 10 years earlier, you are saying the date on which

4

those facts could have been discovered was 9 years earlier

5

or whenever he could have brought it -- brought the claim

6

in the -- in the State court.

7

MR. HIMMELFARB:

That's right.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, therefore, it is not true

9

that he always has that year.

10
11

Under -­

MR. HIMMELFARB:

No.

Under paragraph 6(4), what

you say is absolutely correct, as we see things.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

13

MR. HIMMELFARB:

But the -- the limitation

14

period under AEDPA runs from the latest of the four

15

dates -­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if the date of judgment

17

became final prior to the running of (4), then he would

18

not have a year.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's true.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

21

Now, my question actually is the -- aside from

22

Justice Souter's practical point, it seemed to me that the

23

language here is different from Daniels and different in

24

the other cases.

25

supporting the claim or claims presented could have been

The language is the date on which facts

Page 32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

discovered.

And facts supporting the claim prior to there

2

being a claim are not facts supporting the claim.

3

therefore, it seems as if it would run no later than the

4

moment when he presents the Federal claim.

5

than that could it run.

6

that you present the Federal claim.

7

those facts that could have been discovered earlier, now

8

he has a year to call them to the attention of the court.

And

No earlier

So you have a year from the time
At that point, all

9

And of course, for reasons that you point out,

10

this is certainly a fact that could have been discovered

11

earlier.

12

He could have brought his motion long before.
So what's

wrong with that?

It combines the

13

practical reason that Justice Souter mentioned with the

14

language of the statute.

15

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Let me comment on the language,

16

if I could.

17

supporting the claim, completely in isolation, keeping in

18

mind only Daniels, but ignoring the broader statutory

19

context and the statutory purpose, it might well be the

20

case that the better reading is that the facts supporting

21

the claim is the vacatur of the State conviction not the

22

factual basis for the State claim.

23

If one were to read the phrase, facts

But if you take into account the broader

24

statutory context and statutory purpose, in particular if

25

you take into account the due diligence requirement, we

Page 33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

think the better reading is that facts supporting the

2

claim, in the context of this limitation provision, is the

3

factual basis for the State claim.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It is true -­

But I -- I thought that you

5

conceded at the outset that the facts supporting the claim

6

is the vacatur.

7

that.

8
9

I -- I thought that you opened up with

And it -- it -­
MR. HIMMELFARB:

No, Justice Kennedy.

What I

was agreeing to was the idea that a vacatur of a

10

State motion, is pending in State court.

MR. HIMMELFARB:

10

actually a critical point, Justice Kennedy, because our

11

view is that a -- a State defendant should be required to

12

challenge his State conviction at the earliest possible

13

opportunity, and in most cases that will be soon after his

14

conviction in State court because that will be the time

15

when he knows about the basis for his State claim.

That -- that's right, Justice

We agree with that.
The -- the purpose of AEDPA's limitation

Walker, is to reduce the potential for delay on the road

6

to finality by restricting the time that a prospective

8

think petitioner's interpretation is inconsistent with

12

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Well, the -- the important

13

point is that -- we think is that petitioner's

14

interpretation doesn't work because it gives a defendant

15

an indefinite period to challenge his State conviction,

16

and the only diligence that's required under his

17

interpretation is that you have to exercise diligence in

18

seeing whether the motion to vacate your State conviction

19

was granted whenever it was filed.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that may be but that also

21

may be what it says.

I -- I don't follow your

interpretation of what is the meaning of facts supporting

the claim or claims.

24

supporting the claim is the vacatur of the -- of the State

25

conviction, I mean, it seems that's the end of it.

diligence, yes, it doesn't seem to make much sense in that

context, but as pointed out by your friend on the other

5

side, it makes sense in all other contexts and -- and you

6

don't expect the language to be applicable all the time.

7

So what's wrong with that?

8

MR. HIMMELFARB:

What's wrong with it is that we

9

think it's not only inconsistent with the basic principle

10

embodied in AEDPA's statute of limitations, we think it's

11

inconsistent with the very idea of a statute of

12

limitations.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How can this be a fact

supporting the -- you -- you want us to say a fact

18

supporting the conviction includes the facts that lead up

19

to the facts supporting the conviction or -- or supporting

20

the claim.

21

MR. HIMMELFARB:

Justice Scalia, if the Court

22

rejects our view that the facts supporting the claim under

23

paragraph 6(4) as the factual basis for the State claim,

24

we think it should still reject petitioner's

25

interpretation and should adopt our alternative

Page 41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

interpretation which is not subject to that objection

2

because our alternative interpretation assumes that the

3

facts supporting the claim is the vacatur of the State

4

conviction.

5

at the end of paragraph 6(4), the question is when could

6

that vacatur have been obtained and thus discovered

7

through the exercise of due diligence.

But in light of the due diligence requirement

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In other words, you're saying

due diligence applies to an extraneous fact when you

MR. HIMMELFARB:

It applies to a

question?

17

affects a handful of enhancements that don't really affect

18

the basic conviction or sentence; and secondly, that it's

19

clear that the -- from both the text of the statute and

20

whatever we know about the legislative history, that it's

21

a problem Congress never even thought about?

22

Am I correct in assuming that this really isn't

MR. HIMMELFARB:

As to your first question,

23

Justice Stevens, one -- one would think that this is a

24

little bit of an unusual situation and you don't see too

many cases where it arises.

Perhaps surprisingly, though,

there are quite a few reported decisions where this

2

arises.

3

There are some district courts from other circuits that

4

have weighed in.

6

Eleventh Circuit that raise the same question.

7

There is a 2 to 1 circuit split on this question.

I believe there may be three or four

course, it wouldn't be the -- the first time the Court

there's a set of facts that Congress didn't necessarily

18

consider when it was writing the text.

think it was a case-by-case determination.
