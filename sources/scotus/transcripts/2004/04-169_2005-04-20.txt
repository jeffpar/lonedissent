v. the United States.

Mr. Browning.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BROWNING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether Congress

12

expressly provided for a limitations period for

13

retaliatory discharge action under the Federal False

14

Claims Act.

15

The 6-year limitation period set out in section

16

3731(b) of the act is tied to a violation of section 3729,

17

that is, the submission of a fraudulent claim to the

18

Government.

19

limitations running under section 3731(b) is a violation

20

of section 3729.

21

not an element of the cause of action for retaliatory

22

discharge, Congress did not intend to provide a

23

limitations period in section 3731(b) for a retaliatory

24

discharge action.

25

The triggering event to start the statute of

Because a violation of section 3729 is

The Government in its amicus brief argues that

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress must have intended a uniform limitation period so

2

that all three actions created by the False Claims Act

3

could be brought in the same proceeding.

4

Government's argument undermines the very purpose of the

5

Federal False Claims Act and the retaliatory discharge

6

provision.

7

The -- the

The retaliatory discharge provision, section

8

3730(h) of the False Claims Act, not only protects people

9

who blow the whistle, the initial whistleblower, but it

10

expressly protects people who testify at trial.

11

have seen time and again in many of these cases the

12

Government will keep a case under seal for 5, 6, 7 years.

13

We've seen repeatedly situations, because of the

14

complexity of the underlying violation of the false claim,

15

that it might take a decade from when the complaint is

16

filed to when the case actually is put before a jury.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we

Mr. Browning, this argument

18

that you're making, where you seem to be having great

19

solicitude for the -- for the whistleblowers, for the

20

people who might be retaliated against -- the respondent

21

and the Solicitor General answer your argument by saying

22

in all the years that 3730(h) retaliation claims have been

23

available, there has been no instance of qui tam plaintiff

24

barred because the retaliation occurred outside the 6

25

year limitation.

Yes, one could hypothesize these cases,

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

but are there any actual cases where the retaliation in

2

fact fell outside the 6-year, dated from the submission of

3

the false claim?

4

MR. BROWNING:

Justice Ginsburg, I cannot cite

5

to a specific situation where that has occurred, and the

6

Government, you're right, makes very much of the argument

7

that this is simply hypothetical.

8

and concrete problem when you have cases that go to trial,

9

that it takes so long to go to trial, and those people who

But it is a very real

10

are testifying at trial have no protection because it's

11

more than 6 years from the violation of section 3729.

12

-- I would -

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Maybe they don't get

retaliated against if they testify at trial.

15

MR. BROWNING:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well And if the question is

17

whether there is a problem out there in the real world on

18

-- for people whose interest is certainly not identical to

19

yours.

20

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, I recognize that, but

21

you have to look at the statute as a whole to construe it

22

in its proper context.

23

where there -- a number of years pass from -- from when

24

the complaint is filed to when the testimony takes place

25

at trial.

And there are many situations

And -- and as the amicus brief of the National

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Work Right Institute points out, an organization that's

2

designed to protect the human rights of employees, an

3

organization that's a spin-off of the American Civil

4

Liberties Union, that organization clearly views the

5

interpretation advocated by the respondents and adopted by

6

the Fourth Circuit as detrimental by employees.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

All that's true,

8

but the question that I think Justice Ginsburg asked was

9

you have on your side the whole National Defense

10

Industrial Association.

11

Advisory Council that represents dozens and dozens, I take

12

it, of businesses.

13

in the firm.

14

brains to say has there ever been such an example, and I

15

take the answer is no, never.

16

find one instance where this happened.

17

Because that's what I think unless you provide the

18

example.

19

You have the Equal Employment

We have your own client.

Everybody.

MR. BROWNING:

We have you

I imagine you all racked your

Not all of you could even
Now, am I right?

I cannot cite a specific example.

20

Justice Breyer, I would direct your attention to the case

21

in the Eleventh Circuit, Childray v. UAPGA, in which 4

22

and-a-half years had passed between when the initial

23

allegation of -

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So -- so what would be

so unreasonable about a Member of Congress concluding the

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

following?

2

know?

3

that you think of, and so we are going to end them all

4

after 6 years from the time the thing took place, the

5

cheat took place.

6

other problem of the kind you're worried about that comes

7

up, we will worry about that later through amendment,

8

tolling, et cetera.

9

day statutes of limitations or 90-day statute of

We want these things to end after 6 years, you

And there's never been an example of this horrible

And that's it.

And if there's some

Why is that an -- we don't want 30

10

limitations.

11

And if there's an odd case that doesn't, we'll worry about

12

it.

We want 6 years.

That helps most people.

What's the answer to that?

13

MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, if Congress had

14

said that, they certainly could have made that decision,

15

but it would run completely contrary to almost 200 years

16

of precedent from this Court that as a general rule, the

17

limitations period does not begin to run before your cause

18

of action even comes into existence.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, that's true, it would be.

20

And the reason we're doing it is because there's a period

21

of time when somebody lies to the Government and we don't

22

want actions that are related to that.

23

into that proof to take place more than 6 years later.

24

Now, that would be the reason, and I agree it would be

25

contrary.

We'll have to go

But the difficulty for me is the language seems

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to point to that reason.

2

MR. BROWNING:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4
5

Well -And I can't find that reason

idiotic.
MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't

6

think the language points to that because the language of

7

the limitations period, 3731(b), which is set out in the

8

appendix to the cert petition at page 135a -- the language

9

of the statute is a civil action under section 3730 may

10

not be brought more than 6 years after the date of the

11

violation of section 3729.

12

There are two material aspects of -- of the

13

statutory language:

14

is not an element of the cause of action -

15

the violation of section 3729, which

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I -- I don't mean to

16

interrupt, but it is true that this is a civil action

17

that's brought under 3730(h), is it not?

18

MR. BROWNING:

The -- the action is brought

19

under 3730(h), and Justice Stevens -

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21
22

So it is literally within the

plain language of the statute.
MR. BROWNING:

Well, it is and it isn't.

It is

23

clearly in 3730(h), but when you look at the False Claims

24

Act, Congress has used the phrase, an action under 3730,

25

to mean different things in various portions throughout

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the False Claims Act.

2

six different occasions, and I would particularly direct

3

the Court's attention to 3731(c).

4

provision, Congress has provided that in an action brought

5

under section 3730, the United States must prove the

6

elements of the cause of action by a preponderance of the

7

evidence.

8

have this literal reading of section -- the phrase, an

9

action under 3730, and it means all three causes of action

10

in 3731(b), but that -- but when you turn to 3731(c), that

11

virtually identical phrase appears and you have to read

12

that statutory provision in context, and read in

13

context -

14

Congress has used that phrase on

In -- in that

The respondent and the Government say you must

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It seems -- it seems if you

15

read a provision like this, it says what the United States

16

would be required to prove.

17

any action brought by the United States under 3730.

18

think -- think (c) is clearly talking about cases in which

19

the United States is bringing the action.

20

MR. BROWNING:

Implicit in -- in that is in

Exactly, Justice Ginsburg.

I

You

21

have to read it in context, and I think when you read

22

3731(b) in context and that limitations period is tied to

23

a violation of section 3729, it is clear that Congress did

24

not intend the phrase, an action under 3730, to -- to

25

include a retaliatory discharge action in which a

violation of section JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, I don't think that's at

3

all as clear as that (c) is directed to cases brought by

4

the United States for the reason that Justice Breyer just

5

explained.

6

limitation and say, well, maybe there would be this

7

hypothetical case that you're worried about, but for the

8

most part, 6 years will take care of everybody.

9

Congress might want to have one 6-year

MR. BROWNING:

And, Justice Ginsburg, my point

10

is just as section 3731(c) is not intended to cover all of

11

the causes of action under the False Claims Act, 3731(b)

12

is not intended to cover all of the actions under the

13

False Claims Act as well, that it's only intended to cover

14

the causes of action in which a violation of section 3729

15

is an element of the cause of action.

16

The -- the Government makes the argument that

17

you need a uniform limitations period so these actions can

18

be tried together, but the Government ignores the fact

19

that a qui tam action or an action brought by the

20

Government is a completely different cause of action than

21

an action for retaliatory discharge action.

22

different substantive claims.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They involve

That's true, but is it also

24

not true that some of the people who get retaliated

25

against may be the same people who bring the qui tam

10

Alderson Reporting Company

action?

3

MR. BROWNING:

In some cases, that is -- is the

case, Justice -

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So if they don't get the -

5

recover as being the victim of retaliation, they may still

6

get a very handsome reward for what happened to them.

7

MR. BROWNING:

That is the case, but -- but I

8

also want to point out that in many cases, the person who

9

brings the qui tam action is a completely different

10

plaintiff than the person who brings the retaliatory

11

discharge action.

12

retaliated against for testifying at trial -- in that

13

situation, it's clearly going to be a different plaintiff

14

than the plaintiff who brought the original qui tam

15

action.

16

The example of someone who is

It can also be a different defendant.

Section

3730(h) is intended to preclude an industry from

21

second employer recognizes or -- or learns that this

22

employee had previously been involved in an investigation

under the False Claims Act, that second employer is

24

precluded from retaliating against the -- the employee.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In the real world, do we have

such cases?
MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor.

I cannot cite

4

to a specific case, but I'm aware that that is very much a

5

issue that practitioners face day in and day out.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Another real-world question.

7

Do we -- do we have any -- do you have any experience that

8

you can rely on either to show that in fact these

9

subsection (h) claims are brought customarily with the

10

main qui tam action or, conversely, that they are brought

11

separately?

12

Do we know what's going on?

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is a real

13

mix, that on many cases you will see a retaliatory

14

discharge action brought independently, and in other cases

15

you'll see the qui tam action and the retaliation action

16

brought simultaneously.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In connection with what's

18

included and what isn't included, the -- in that same 3731

19

provision in (d), (d) is limited to (a) and (b) and so

20

excludes (h).

21

to the 6-year period, they could have said the same thing,

22

that it relates to (a) and (b) and not (h).

23

And if Congress had meant that with respect

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, I would recognize

24

that there is different language that Congress could have

25

-- have chosen to state this in a different way, but -

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and you're right, that in section 3731(d), Congress did

2

specifically reference section 3730(a) and 3730(b), but

3

Congress did not use that precision in drafting throughout

4

the Federal False Claims Act.

5

of ambiguities that exist throughout the Federal False

6

Claims Act.

7

Accounting Office as the Government Accounting Office.

8
9

Just -- there are a number

Congress even referred to the General

JUSTICE SCALIA:
in 3731(c) also.

They could have done the same

Instead of just saying any action

10

brought under section 3730, they could have said any

11

action brought under -- which one?

12

is the one that allows the Government suit?

13

MR. BROWNING:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16
17

and they didn't.

(a) of -- of -- which

3730(a), Justice Scalia.
(a).

They could have said (a),

They said all of 3730.

MR. BROWNING:

Yes.

So -- so all you can really

take from the statute is that the phrase -

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. BROWNING:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. BROWNING:

22

to look at the context.

23

and when you're dealing with a statute that is drafted in

24

a way that's sloppy, you have to look at what Congress

25

really intended, and when Congress -

Sloppy Yes.
-- is what you can take.
Yes, Your Honor.

That you have

You have to look at the meaning,

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask -- may I ask you a

2

question about the alternative?

3

statute, you -- you refer to State law for the correct

4

cause -- statute of limitations I guess.

5

MR. BROWNING:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If we don't follow this

Yes, Your Honor.
And I imagine because there

7

are different forms of retaliation -- sometimes it's a

8

discharge, sometimes it might be slander by defaming the

9

person for his next employer, it might be a tort, they

10

beat him up or something, there could be a lot of

11

different kinds of retaliation -- each of which would give

12

rise to a different statute of limitations under State

13

law.

14

Does that seem reasonable?
MR. BROWNING:

Well, Your Honor, this Court has

15

faced that situation with 1983 in a variety of contexts,

16

and there are a number of -

17
18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We had to make up a rule to

fill a gap.

19

MR. BROWNING:

And -- and in North Carolina it's

20

easy.

21

everything.

22

look at the -- in North Carolina, you look at the

23

limitations period for -

24
25

It is basically a 3-year statute of limitations for
And for a retaliatory discharge action, you

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But what about Wisconsin,

Michigan, Illinois, and -- and Florida?

Maybe they all

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

have different statutes and they have different kinds of

2

causes of action that may be relevant in the retaliation

3

case.

4

MR. BROWNING:

Your Honor, that is certainly an

5

issue.

6

a matter that is clear and simple because North Carolina

7

you look to a retaliatory discharge action -

With respect to the parties in this case, that is

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but in our construction of

the statute, we have to think about its application

10

throughout the United States, not just in North -- North

11

Carolina.

12

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, and a rule that would apply

13

the residual limitation period for personal injury would

14

certainly be appropriate for a situation like this.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is it -- is it a necessary

16

element of a successful action for retaliatory discharge

17

that -- that the action under the False Claims Act have

18

succeeded?

19

MR. BROWNING:

No, Your Honor.

The courts have

20

repeatedly held that for a retaliatory discharge action,

21

it is not necessary to have a violation of section 3729.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What does the Government

23

contend is to be done under (b)(1) when no violation of

24

section 3729 is committed?

25

MR. BROWNING:

Well, the way I read the

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Government's brief is they want to modify the language of

2

section 3731(b) by inserting the phrase alleged before the

3

phrase, violation of section 3729.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But don't we have to do that

5

anyway when -- when in fact a person brings an ordinary

6

claim?

7

cheated the Government.

8

committed.

9

all, he might lose.

10

I mean, Joe Smith brings a claim that XYZ company
Now, that doesn't mean it was

It just means he says it was committed.

MR. BROWNING:

After

But -- but, Justice Breyer, when

11

the jury renders its verdict, if there is a violation of

12

section 3729 that's proven to exist, but that -- that

13

proven violation is beyond the 6-year period, the

14

defendant would be entitled to judgment based upon the

15

affirmative action -

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You mean if in fact the

17

plaintiff loses because the jury finds for the defendant

18

in the qui tam action, then it should have been dismissed

19

on statute of limitations grounds.

20
21
22

MR. BROWNING:

No, Your Honor.

What I'm

saying JUSTICE BREYER:

No, of course not because -

23

because the word is committed there refers to the claim of

24

a plaintiff.

25

Doesn't it?

MR. BROWNING:

What I'm -- what I'm saying is

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you have to look at the facts that are ultimately proven

2

at trial, and if the fact of the violation is more than 6

3

years from the filing of the cause of action, clearly

4

that's going to be barred by the limitations period.

5

word alleged does not appear in the statute, and the

6

Government tries to -- they essentially confuse the issue

7

by saying, well, you -- you could never -- a defendant

8

could never prevail on a motion to dismiss because you

9

have to look at the allegations for a motion to dismiss.

10

But that's the very nature JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, it seems to me that if

12

-- if there's no violation, then there's no triggering

13

event to start the statute of limitations running.

14

The

MR. BROWNING:

Yes, Your Honor.

That -- that's

15

the real problem, that even under the Government's

16

reading, that there is not a triggering event.

17

you look at 3731(b) as a whole, when you try to discern

18

congressional intent, Congress intended a -- the

19

triggering event to be a violation of section 3729 which

20

doesn't apply to a retaliatory discharge action.

21

So when

Your Honor, the -- the statute here is worded in

22

such a way that throughout the Federal False Claims Act,

23

there are a variety of ambiguities, but when you look at

24

the statute as a whole, when you look at the stated

25

purpose that Congress had of protecting people who testify

way that's harmonious, and that's to read it so that

3731(b) only applies to section 3730(a) and 3730(b) -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Browning, is it proper to

5

consider in the calculus that if you use 6 years from the

6

date the -- that the false claim was made or was alleged

7

to be made, then you don't have to get into the question

8

which State's statute of limitations, the choice of law

9

question, and then when you identify that State, which

10

limitation period within that State?

11

two inquiries which can sometimes be rather complicated.

12

They are obviated entirely if we take the 6 years from the

13

Federal statute.

14

MR. BROWNING:

I mean, those are

Justice Ginsburg, you're

15

absolutely right, that if the respondents' and the Fourth

16

Circuit's reading of the statute is correct, that Congress

17

did intend this bizarre result to take place for all three

18

causes of action, then you don't have to look to a State

19

law cause of action to fill the gap.

20

But there are many circumstances where this

21

Court has recognized that you do -- when Congress has not

22

expressly provided a limitations period, the most

23

appropriate vehicle is to look to the most closely

24

analogous State law cause of action.

25

one of the comparable situations here is ERISA.

MR. HURT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The text of this statute could not be more clear

10

on this issue.

under section 3730, and a civil action under 3730 is

12

subject to a 6-year limitations period.

13

A retaliation claim is a civil action

Petitioners argue, in effect, that the Court

14

should disregard the plain language here and claim that

15

Congress really meant that only two of the three causes of

16

action under section 3730, should be subject to the 6

17

year limitations period, those brought under sections (a)

18

and (b), and that Congress told us this indirectly by

19

changing the limitations trigger -- this simply makes no

20

sense for two reasons.

21

First, there is no reason why Congress would

have limited the scope of the limitations period in such a

cryptic manner.

you're going to have situations where as little as 180

1

the argument that unlike most retaliation situations, here

2

if you take that 6-year period, which is much longer than

the general run of retaliation statutes take it, then you

would have a qui tam plaintiff who waits while the back

exactly that situation, the -- the whistleblower damages

are going to be mounting during that period of 1 or 2 or

MR. HURT:

Isn't that what your argument

I think that -- that that is a

possible case, but I think that that's -- the priorities

16

for the Government and -- and Congress in drafting this

17

law was to get money back for the Government.

18

their number one concern here and to incentivize that

19

whistleblower.

20

takes much -- takes a long time to prepare his qui tam and

21

brings his -- his retaliation action at the same time and

22

ends up getting some more damages, I -- I think that ranks

23

low on the list of Congress' priorities in drafting this

24

retaliation provision.

25

Government's money back, giving the whistleblower

That's

If it so happens that the whistleblower

It's the -- getting the

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

protection and an incentive to bring that qui tam claim is

2

really Congress' core concern here.

3

And I think these other issues about damages

4

mounting can be readily addressed with the mitigation

5

defense and -- and dealing with that that will take care

6

of double damages so -- so if the whistleblower is just

7

sitting around waiting for that, then the mitigation

8

defense would take care of that.

9

Also, I think the petitioner raised the idea

10

that this is some kind of -- the -- the retaliator can

11

bring some kind of nebulous fraud allegation if it doesn't

12

-- isn't really tied to a specific false claim.

13

that the courts are not interpreting it that way because

14

this is a False Claims Act retaliation claim, not just a

15

generalized fraud claim.

16

be a claim that -- that the whistleblower will -- will be

17

able to point to and say I think that this claim is false.

18

I have a good faith belief that it is false, and then it

19

-- and that's what the trigger would be based on.

20
21

I think

So in a typical case, there will

I mean, in summary, if there's no further
questions, I'd like to just summarize.

22

I think this Court should uphold the plain

23

language of the statute.

24

unusual, it is the one that Congress set forth in the

statute.

It makes sense.

none of the reasons given by the petitioners come close to

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

19

Section 3731(b) provides the statute of

20

limitations for, quote, a civil action under section 3730.

21

There is no question that Ms. Wilson's claim of

22

retaliation is a claim under section 3730.

asks the Court to construe section 3731(b) to include an

24

implicit limitation to claims under subsections (a) or

(b) -

5

interpreted to -- to include only those causes of action

that the rest of that provision applies to, namely, those

-- those actions under 3730 that involve the United

States.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Section 3731(c) does

11

not require, in its application, the Court to construe a

12

civil action under section 3730 to mean anything other

13

than what its words import because it only relates to the

14

United States' burden of proof.

15

The petitioner suggested that it implicitly was

16

limited to an action under 3730(a).

17

certainly not true because if -- if an action is brought

18

under 3730(b) and the United States intervenes, section

19

3731(c) establishes the standard of proof.

20

were to amend section 3730(h) to allow the United States

21

to bring a claim on behalf of the employee who was

22

retaliated against, section 3731(c) would, by its terms,

23

establish the burden of proof that the United States would

24

have to meet.

25

But a statute of repose can come in and instead tied to

5

the act, say, for instance, in which the date that a

6

product was first sold into the market.

7

of action, for purposes of statute of limitations, will

limitations start to run when the cause of action accrues.

11

But in each of those case -- cases, the Court was very

12

clear that that was the rule that applied in the absence

13

of contrary indication by Congress.

14

very explicit contrary indication by Congress, that the

15

statute of limitations for any civil action under section

16

3730 runs from the date on which the violation of section

17

3729 was committed.

18

And here we have a

In other words, Congress has opted here to

19

establish a single uniform statute of limitations for all

20

claims that might arise under the False Claims Act.

21

as I said before, that serves the purposes of the False

22

Claims Act better, far better certainly, than petitioner's

23

alternative.

24
25

And

As we have pointed out, many State statutes of
limitations, assuming that one can determine which one

any number of adverse consequences follow.

6

As a practical matter, then an employee might be
If they split their claims,

First, they could find themselves barred from

7

bringing a subsequent qui tam action on behalf of the

8

United States by the public disclosure bar of the False

9

Claims Act.

The Eleventh Circuit has a rule that says

10

that the two claims are one for purposes of res judicata.

11

So in the Eleventh Circuit, apparently they could be

12

barred by res judicata from bringing a qui tam action.

13

The disclosures in the course of the wrongful

14

termination of retaliation claim action would, of course,

15

alert the defendant to the scope and extent of any

16

Government investigation.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, he's already alerted to

18

the extent that he's taking retaliatory action as true.

19

He may not whole -- know the -- the whole extent of -- of

20

what the employee knows, but he's already been tipped off.

21

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, as a practical

22

matter, oftentimes the employer fires the employee as soon

23

as the employer has a sense that the employee is on to

24

something.

25

large extent.

There's also the fact of just the litigation

23

And

You -- you want us to say that (b)(1) must

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

The -- the most close

24

reading of the text would be that any civil action under

3730 can be brought within 3 years of when the official of

on this.

the facts relevant to bringing a cause of action that the

5

United States could bring, i.e., the cause of action under

3730(a).

action under 3730 could be brought, including the qui tam

action or including a retaliation action.

10

We believe that is only a Government official,

But we think that 3 years from that date in the

But that reading is not essential to the
position that we advocate here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So that -- that could exclude

12

even a retaliation action by an individual who -- who

13

doesn't -- who doesn't know when the -- when the

14

individual -- the official of the United States found out

15

about those facts.

16

reasonable.

That -- that doesn't seem to me very

17

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, of course -

That provision is very -- very

19

reasonable as applied to qui tam actions.

20

to me to make any sense as applied to a retaliation

21

action.

22

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

It doesn't seem

Well, Your Honor, it -

23

it does make sense applying it to a retaliation action

24

because it could be, for instance, the employee who was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It might be, but maybe the

came forward.

7

States.

8
9

Maybe there was an official in the United

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

That's -- that's

possible.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so he's -- you know, he's

11

-- he's out of -- out of time before he even knows about

12

it.

13
14

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, there may be

events that -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Strange.
There may be instances

17

where the employee would not know that they could take

18

advantage of that provision.

19

But in the Bay Area Laundry case, the Court

20

considered and rejected a virtually identical argument.

21

That case -- the statute of limitations also was stated in

22

the alternative, and the second one was 3 years after the

23

information necessary to the claim had arrived.

24

party who was opposed to the position the Court ultimately

25

adopted said that the Court's interpretation of the first

37
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

of the two alternatives would render the second

2

superfluous.

3

this category of claims, but it's not superfluous to other

4

categories of claims, and so that does not prevent us from

5

construing the first provision in the way that we are.

6

And the Court said, it may be superfluous to

So likewise, even if the Court were to conclude

7

that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a retaliation claim or

8

unavailable to a qui tam claim, as some courts of appeals

9

have held, it would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is

10

unavailable, just as holding that 3731(b)(2) is

11

unavailable to a qui tam relator would not mean that

12

3731(b)(1) is unavailable to a qui tam relator.

13

A couple of Justices, Justice Souter -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, but it -- but it would mean

15

that just as 3731(b)(2) can be selectively applied to some

16

categories and not to others, so also, by parity of

17

reasoning, (b)(1) can selectively be applied to some

18

categories of violation and not to others.

19

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, again, we believe

20

that the best, most faithful reading of the text is that

21

(b)(2) is available to all causes of action under 3730.

22

The -- Justice Souter asked a question about

23

statistics and the frequency with which the claims are

24

litigated together.

25

decisions, there were 51 court of appeals decisions

In a review of court of appeals

In -- in -

That's -

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

-- 14 claims an

13

It may be that the Government had sought this -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

being brought separate.

15

the other 5.

16

Well, I would county that as
I think you should add that with

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, Your Honor, in -

17

in fact, if we -- if we look more closely at those 14

18

cases, 5 of them were dismissed because the plaintiff was

19

not even involved in protected conduct under the statute.

20

So the closer you get to the core of what Congress had in

21

mind, when it enacted the statute, of -- of pulling out

22

employees who have the information that only they have

23

that the Government needs in order to recover fraud, the

24

closer you get to that core, the more likely it is that

the claims that are going to be litigated together.

And

1

that's the way the Court ought to apply the statute.

2

the way Congress wrote the statute, to serve those

purposes.

It's

The -- I -- I think that the alternative of

5

applying State statutes of limitations raises -- North

6

Carolina does not dispute that, for example, in Florida

7

the -- the analogous statute of limitations under Florida

8

law -- it's the Florida State False Claims Act which has a

9

retaliation provision -- would be 180 days.

180 days is

10

far too short to put together the complicated qui tam

11

complaint that is called for under the False Claims Act.

12
13

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
Florida didn't think so.

MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

didn't think it was too short.
MR. HALLWARD-DRIEMEIER:

Well, Florida may have

18

made an alternative policy decision in terms of wanting

19

the claims to be litigated together or apart.

20

Congress has established a single uniform statute of

21

limitations which allows the claims to be litigated

22

together, and as I've said, that is in fact the practice

23

that when someone is going to bring a qui tam action, they

24

almost invariably -- there -- there are 5 exceptions -

bring the cases together.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER G. BROWNING, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. BROWNING:

9

The Government argues that there will be

Thank you.

10

problems that will arise from splitting the qui tam action

11

and the retaliatory discharge action.

12

examples that the Government use -- uses is the public

13

disclosure doctrine which is set out in section

14

3730(e)(4)(A) of the False Claims Act.

15

disclosure doctrine, however, is a red herring here

16

because the public disclosure doctrine is designed to keep

17

-- to avoid parasitic lawsuits where information is in the

18

-- the public domain, somebody taking that information,

19

and then filing a -- a qui tam lawsuit.

20

And one of the

The public

The -- the public disclosure doctrine,

21

3730(e)(4)(A), also provides that when someone is the

22

original source of the information, even if the basis for

23

the lawsuit has been made public through a congressional

24

hearing or elsewhere, that person can still bring an

25

action if they're an original source.

So it's a complete

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

red herring here.

2

The other red herring that was put forth is a

3

statement that there's a rule in the Eleventh Circuit

4

relating to claims splitting.

5

recall the name of the case that the Government is

6

referring to, but it is a decision by James C. Hill.

7

that specific case involved a situation where the qui tam

8

action was brought, a settlement was reached, and then

9

well after the fact, the plaintiff said, oh, and I have

And forgive me, I cannot

10

this retaliation claim.

11

situation to -- to apply principles of res judicata.

And

It makes perfect sense in that

12

What the Government is ignoring is there are no

13

reported decisions anywhere where a retaliatory discharge

14

action was brought and then res judicata was used to bar

15

the qui tam action filed at a later date.

16

perfectly logical reason for that because they are

17

different causes of action, and they involve different

18

parties.

19

A qui tam action is an action brought on behalf of the

20

Government.

21

And there's a

A retaliation claim is personal to the individual.

One final point that I'd like to make is the

22

respondent takes the position that the False Claims Act is

23

unique.

24

when you look at the Major Fraud Act, there is a

25

retaliatory discharge provision that is virtually

Well, it's not unique.

MR. BROWNING:

The Major Fraud Act is a criminal

12

provision that provides a retaliatory discharge provision

13

for anyone who assists the Government in bringing the

criminal prosecution.

16

years in which the prosecution has to be brought by the

17

United States.

There -- there -- in the Major

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. BROWNING:

But -- but there is -- it -- but

21

the criminal statute provides for a civil remedy for a

22

retaliatory discharge, and with respect to that

23

retaliatory discharge provision in the Major Fraud Act,

24

there is no limitations provision.

25

One other point that I want to make is that the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

4

ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1140.

5

have consistently held that there is no express

7

the limitations period under the most closely analogous

8

State law cause of action.

9

ERISA is a statute that has essentially a
