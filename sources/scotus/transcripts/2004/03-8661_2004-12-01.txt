ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. NATHANSON:

the merits and unequivocally so.

Smith's acquittal placed him in jeopardy for that same

15

offense twice.

That acquittal entitled

Instead, what he got was a moving

The trial judge's later reconsideration of

Smith's position on the matter is completely

17

faithful to this Court's precedent, and it makes sense in

18

the real-world practice of criminal law.

19

The State, on the other hand, asks this Court to

20

make exceptions to the rule, long-held, that acquittals

21

terminate jeopardy.

22

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No.

Just to say that this -

what happened here was not a final determination.
Take an analog -- an analogy to rule 54(b).

The

judge can say, yes, I've made this ruling and it sticks.

Why shouldn't it operate the same

The Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't

rare exceptions.

11

What I think the best way to -- to really define

12

finality here -- and -- and whatever finality is, I really

13

do think we -- we do have it here because this Court has

14

said an acquittal under Martin Linen, a resolution,

15

correct or not, of some or all if the factual elements -

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but I looked at Martin

17

Linen, and there, there was something labeled judgment of

acquittal entered.

19

motion, and then we have an entry by the clerk saying -

20

what does the entry say?

21

that.

25

Here we have an endorsement on a

MR. NATHANSON:

Motion granted or something like

Allowed, and it was attested by

the clerk.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
might be significant.

Yes.

But is there -- this

Is there in Massachusetts, when a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

motion for acquittal is granted and there are other

2

charges still going on, is there a piece of paper that

3

says, judgment, acquitted on count whatever it was?

4

MR. NATHANSON:

No, Your Honor.

The -- the

5

formal rule, which is not always observed, but the formal

6

rule is that it must be recorded on -- on the docket and

7

announced in an open courtroom.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That happened here.

Well, suppose you have a State

and the State has a statute, and the statute says any

10

motion for acquittal may be granted by the -- the trial

11

court at the close of the prosecution's evidence, but that

12

motion shall not be deemed final and may be reviewed by

13

the district court at any time before -- or by the trial

14

court at any time before the submission of the case to the

15

jury.

16

defendant is on notice that this may not be final.

17

would be the -- your position in that case if a statute

18

like that were on the books?

19

different, then I'll say, well, suppose the supreme court

20

of Massachusetts just makes up this rule as a judicial

21

matter.

22

Then there's no repose element because the -- the

MR. NATHANSON:

What

And if you say that that's

Well, to answer the first

23

question, I think that if -- if such a statute were

24

enacted, I'm willing to grant, for purposes of this case,

25

that it wouldn't be a double jeopardy problem.

It may in

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a later case -- and you know, I'd be very interested in

2

that -- a problem under a combination of Jackson and

3

Winship because the defendant may have a -- a right to

4

that determination.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay, well, let -- let's just

6

assume that you've conceded that.

7

guarded about it.

8

we do that by a judicial decision by the supreme court of

9

-- Judicial Court of Massachusetts?

10

Now, you've been

If we can do that by statute, why can't

MR. NATHANSON:

Well, first of all, the Supreme

11

Judicial Court of Massachusetts is the one who promulgated

12

the rules in this case.

13

Supreme Judicial Court of -

14
15
16
17
18

Rule 25(a) is promulgated by the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but they put a gloss on

the rule by their decision.
MR. NATHANSON:

Well, that was the Massachusetts

Appeals Court, I might add.
Second of all, the rule itself requires that the

19

motion shall be ruled upon at that time.

20

about reconsideration, and clearly --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

It says nothing

They've held that in this case.

22

We have a Massachusetts decision.

23

under their law in Massachusetts, the judge can revise it.

24

MR. NATHANSON:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's their law and

Actually Well, if it isn't their law,

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

then I don't know how -- why they affirmed this conviction

2

rather than reversing it.

3
4

MR. NATHANSON:

I'm not sure I know either, Your

Honor.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right, but I mean, I -- I

6

take it that it is their law, otherwise I'd see reversal,

7

wouldn't I, and not affirmance?

8
9

MR. NATHANSON:

Actually I think what they

did -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. NATHANSON:

What?
-- Your Honor, is they assumed

12

that there was an error in -- in -- when dealing strictly

13

with the rule, at the -- at the end of the section dealing

14

with this, they assume that there was an error and said no

15

prejudice, which I've contended in the brief --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so in other words,

17

they're saying that in this case -- how could there not be

18

prejudice?

19

I don't understand this from beginning to end then.

20
21
22

He had another trial.

I mean -- how could -

But let me go back to my original question.
What rule do you propose?
MR. NATHANSON:

As for finality, the rule I

23

propose is, first of all, we have to start with the basic

24

foundation, which is an acquittal, under Martin Linen with

25

a resolution -

MR. NATHANSON:

What I'm saying is, for double

Yes.
-- an acquittal in your view is

an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes when?

6

MR. NATHANSON:

7

that I think Court should look at.

8

because we treat acquittals from the bench for double

9

jeopardy purposes the same as acquittals from a jury, a

There's -- there's three things
One, first of all,

prosecutor can poll a jury immediately after the verdict.

11

A prosecutor clearly -

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

I'm asking you for a -

I'd have to write -- if I agreed with you, I'd have to say

14

we have here a judge who changed his mind.

Now, go ahead.

Under the

According -- I know what their

rule is.

the point that the jury is dismissed, something like that.

21

I understand that.

22

is your rule a judge cannot change his mind once he writes

the word acquittal on a piece of paper, even if he says,

oh my God, I meant to say no acquittal?

Now, I want to know what your rule -

Too late.

that the rule?

MR. NATHANSON:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. NATHANSON:

No, Your Honor.
Okay.

What is the rule?

The -- your first question -

5

the constitutional point of no return, shall we say, is

6

further proceedings.

7

are further proceedings -

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

If there is an acquittal and there

There is no further proceeding

if he writes the word acquittal, I guess until he changes

10

his mind.

11

Now there are further proceedings.

12

MR. NATHANSON:

So 3 minutes later, he says I change my mind.

Well, then at that point you

13

look to other indicia of finality that this -- this Court

14

referenced that in -- in Vincent, and that -- that's

15

generally compliance with State procedure.

16

with State procedures -

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Compliance

I need to write a simple rule.

18

All I'm trying to get from you is what is your rule.

19

your rule that when a judge writes the word acquittal --

20

an acquittal, by the way, happens to mean there's nothing

21

left for the jury to do on that charge.

But your answer just isn't

When has it become final?

MR. NATHANSON:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It ripens at the When?

When the judge says

10

something, when he writes something?

11

final?

MR. NATHANSON:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. NATHANSON:

does it become final?

Just one thing.

Just when

Let's limit it to one thing.

MR. NATHANSON:

It -- it becomes final when

there are further proceedings initiated.

22

What -- what I'm suggesting is

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

19
20

What is your proposed rule?

-- is two things.

What I'm suggesting is -

case.

Can he do

I'm not entirely sure of the

6

answer to the question, Your Honor, but I -- I think,

7

first of all, we look at compliance with State procedure.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

What I thought from

reading your brief, which you're confirming, is your rule

10

-- once the judge says acquittal, that's the end of it.

11

If he decides 3 seconds later, he cannot change his mind.

12

Now, that rule to me is inconsistent with most law.

13

MR. NATHANSON:

If we're talking about a

14

clerical error, Your Honor, the Massachusetts rules and

15

the Federal rules provide for correction of clerical

16

errors.

17

clerical error, but the judge clearly intended to do what

18

she did.

What -- what we're talking about here is not a

19

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, was your client --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But a very plain error -

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

-- was your client prejudiced

22

in any way by not putting on some evidence that the -- he

23

would have put on?

24

MR. NATHANSON:

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

May I begin, Your Honor -Just answer the question for

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

once.

2

MR. NATHANSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

There -- there

3

was a defense that he essentially forfeited by not being

4

aware that the judge was going to, at some point -

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was a terribly risky

6

defense because his main defense is I wasn't there, I

7

didn't do it, somebody else did it.

8

turn around and say I missed the opportunity to tell the

9

jury I really was there, but it was okay for me to have

How could he then

10

the gun?

11

that after having spent his whole effort to say it was the

12

other guy, it wasn't this defendant?

13

this defense that he had a right to possess this gun

14

because he belonged in the house, that would be

15

extraordinary.

16

I mean, what -- what defense counsel would do

MR. NATHANSON:

And then to make

Your Honor, counsel for co

17

defendant, Felicia Brown, presented just such a defense

18

and she was acquitted.

19

Melvin Smith did not shoot Christopher Robinson, but if

20

Melvin -

21
22

She presented the defense that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
possessing a gun.

23

MR. NATHANSON:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Nobody charged her with

But what I'm saying is That's -- look, there were a

lot of charges in this case, and we're dealing with what

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is a relatively lesser offense of this whole string of

2

events so that Brown being acquitted of other offenses

3

doesn't say anything about this offense, which relates to

4

the possession of a gun.

5

MR. NATHANSON:

That's -- that's all that it is.
What I'm saying is that it

6

wasn't risky, Your Honor, because the -- this jury was

7

willing to consider an alternative defense that would have

8

otherwise appeared as a concession.

9

as a concession.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They did not take it

But he would be -- the

11

defendant -- you know, he hasn't gone to the jury yet, and

12

the jury would say, my goodness, this is like a common law

13

pleader.

14

I got it.

15

say I wasn't there, that's my main defense, but then,

16

jury, I'd like you also to consider that if you think that

17

I was there, then -- it -- it really doesn't fly as a

18

criminal defense.

19

I didn't borrow the kettle.
Or, I returned it unbroken.

MR. NATHANSON:

It was broken when
To -- to do that, to

I'd just respectfully disagree,

20

Your Honor.

21

allow this rule in general, we are going to engender

22

serious problems.

23

some reliance here, but we're going to engender much more

24

serious problems in other cases where a defendant perhaps

25

presents a defense that is helpful to the remaining

But -- but the -- the larger point is if we

I'm saying that there -- that there was

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

charges, but damaging on the acquitted charge.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but if -- if -- you

3

know, we shape the expectation by what we say.

4

we say that a judge is always free to consider his ruling

5

and as long as the -- there's a right to reopen, then any

6

kind of reliance is -- is misplaced.

7

MR. NATHANSON:

If -- if

What Massachusetts law says in

8

-- in the Zavala case, they said that there is not a right

9

to reopen where the judge has determined that the evidence

10

is insufficient.

11

Second of all --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is when the case is not

13

ongoing.

14

and -- and the judge said, oops, I made a mistake, which

15

is common at the trial level.

16

she made this decision in a split second.

17

too hasty, and then a trial judge will say, my law clerk

18

went to the library at lunch, there was a Supreme Judicial

19

Court of Massachusetts case going just the other way, so

20

of course, I confess error, but the defendant isn't

21

prejudice.

22

I mean, here we had a case that was continuing

I mean, these decisions Maybe she was

The defendant hadn't put on a -- well, the -- it

23

came up at closing.

24

prejudice, anyway he could have said, wait a minute,

25

judge, I want to put on that defense that I really was

Right?

So if the defendant was

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

there but I had a right to have the gun.

2

MR. NATHANSON:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He didn't say that, Your Honor.
But he could have.

So he -

4

so I don't see that you have a realistic claim of

5

prejudice.

6

MR. NATHANSON:

Well, I -- I don't think

7

prejudice is a factor in double jeopardy jurisprudence.

8

Either the defendant has been placed twice in jeopardy or

9

he has not.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but you have to set a -

11

a point in time, and your point is -- well, it's not

12

exactly clear, but there's one point that says when the

13

jury is discharged.

14

there's unfairness to the defendant so that you wouldn't

15

permit it, other than double jeopardy.

16

isn't that a sensible place to draw the line?

17

Then there may be other reasons why

MR. NATHANSON:

But if -- why

Because if -- if discharge of

18

the jury is the rule, then the judge can reconsider an

19

acquittal at any point in a defendant's case.

20

into a defense case, the judge could reconsider an

21

acquittal.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2 weeks

The question -- we're talking

23

about a Federal constitutional rule, and suppose -- you

24

pointed out this went only to an intermediate appellate

25

court.

Suppose the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

interpreted its rule at 25(a) and it says, that rule

2

allows some leeway for the judge to say I got it wrong as

3

long as there's no prejudice to the defense.

4

our rule means.

That's what

5

MR. NATHANSON:

6

permissible, Your Honor.

7

purposes of this argument, that it's permissible for

8

States to order judges to withhold rulings, that there

9

of Massachusetts to say that an acquittal has no force is

14

simply straight contravening what this Court has said.

15

It's -- it's essentially a continuing jeopardy argument.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you do agree, I take it,

17

that if the judge says, yes, I agree with you, there isn't

18

a scintilla of evidence, and -- and at some point I'm -

19

I'm going to enter an acquittal, but I'm not going to do

20

it now just in case I have a second thought, but at least

21

by the -- the end of the trial, I'll take care of it, you,

22

I take it, concede that that is permissible.

23
24
25

MR. NATHANSON:

I think that is permissible

they are not going to be confident in their ruling.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I don't

No, but every judge knows he

drops a catch once in a while, and -- and if he wants to

17

guard against wrecking the whole trial or -- or creating

18

an appellate issue later, he's just going to be cautious

19

and hold onto it.

20
21

MR. NATHANSON:

And judges should be cautious,

Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

there's any practical effect to your winning in this case?
MR. NATHANSON:

There is a practical effect.

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

11

MR. NATHANSON:

What is it?

Firearm possession offenses in

12

Massachusetts have restrictions as to parole and good time

13

deductions that the other offenses do not have.

14

is a practical effect, aside from the fact that it's a -

15

it's a conviction on his record, Your Honor.

So there

16

Moving on, Justice Breyer, just to address the

17

question that you were asking me, I think perhaps a good

18

way to phrase it is -- is if the first factual resolution

19

of the elements of -- of the offense results in acquittal,

20

there can be no further proceedings.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

What I was thinking is -- I

22

mean, here a judge -- I guess she was harried in the

23

trial, she's thinking to herself, well, let's see, is

24

there any evidence here that this was less than the

25

shotgun -- this was not a shotgun.

You know, it had to be

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

a barrel less than 16 inches.

2

here of the shotgun?

3

was a lot of evidence that it was a pistol.

Now, there

4

aren't many pistols that are 16 inches long.

So she's

5

thinking, something may be missing here.

6

uncertain, but she writes acquittal, and then a few

7

minutes later, she thinks, let's say, oh, my God, there

8

was all that evidence about the pistol.

9

have done that.

10

So is there any evidence

And she, I guess, forgot that there

She's a little

So I shouldn't

I mean, how -- how is a judge like that, a

11

hypothetical -- what's she supposed to do?

12

supposed to say, I better not enter anything, because

13

after all, I don't care if the defendant has to produce a

14

case?

15

well, I could change my mind before it's over?

16

she supposed to do?

Or is she supposed to enter something and think,

17
18

Or what is

She just thinks she made a mistake.

MR. NATHANSON:

So your hypothetical is that

there's evidence of two guns?

19
20

Is she

I thought here there was

evidence there was a pistol, but maybe I'm wrong.

21

MR. NATHANSON:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry.

Yes, in this case -

There was evidence it was a

23

pistol.

24

there was evidence.

25

I'm just using it as an example where a judge might think

So I -- I would have thought, reading this, that

2

that it wasn't a shotgun, and I guess she forgot that

3

there was evidence it was a pistol and a pistol is not a

4

shotgun.

5

She thought there was no evidence

MR. NATHANSON:

She -- she clearly didn't

6

forget.

7

testified to that it was a pistol, it was a revolver, it

8

was a .32 -

9

The prosecutor said to her the evidence was

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I'm quite sure -- not

10

quite sure then why she wrote down there was no evidence

11

it wasn't a shotgun, but she had some reason.

12

few minutes later, she thinks, boy, whatever my reason is,

13

it couldn't have been that good.

14

that's a reason an hour from now or maybe a day from now.

What's the line?

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, I would like to know,

5

given that answer, why is this final under State procedure

6

because it seems as if the State courts of Massachusetts

have said, no, it is not a constitutional error to go and

8

look into this again.

that's what I'd like you to focus on because I agree that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHRYN A. NEAVES

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16
17

MS. NEAVES:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to start with where the Court left off

18

on the notion of reconsideration and finality.

19

Massachusetts Appeals Court here specifically stated that

20

a judge's right to reconsider his or her legal rulings is

21

firmly rooted in the common law and permitted Judge

22

Donovan in this case to reconsider her legal ruling that

23

the evidence was insufficient.

24

right of reconsideration could not run afoul of this

25

Court's double jeopardy jurisprudence, but the appeals

The

Certainly that common law

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

court specifically stated that the Double Jeopardy Clause

2

was not violated because there was no second proceeding

3

and that the judge in this case, therefore, was permitted

4

to reconsider her ruling.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if -- what if this had

6

been the sole count, the gun possession count had been the

7

sole count, and -- and the same ruling had been made by

8

the judge?

9

attaching or not?

10

Would you say that there was double jeopardy

MS. NEAVES:

Not so long as the jury was still

11

there.

12

Judge Donovan, give me 10 minutes, I know there's a

13

Supreme Judicial Court case on the point that I'm arguing

14

to you, which is that you did not need a witness to

15

directly testify that the gun barrel length was less than

16

16 inches, I know there's a case, give me 10 minutes, take

17

a recess, and if the judge agreed to do that and the

18

prosecutor came back and gave the case to the judge and

19

the judge said, absolutely, you're -- you're correct, I'm

20

going to send the charge to the jury, there's no double

21

jeopardy violation there.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MS. NEAVES:

If the prosecutor had the opportunity to say,

And what if it's a bench trial?

A bench trial is a very difficult

24

situation.

25

hardest case here, but bench trials present different -- a

And the Smalis case certainly seems to be the

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

different situation because the judge is both the fact-

2

finder and the law-giver.

3

more difficult -

4
5
6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And in that context, it's much

I know it's difficult.

What's

your answer?
MS. NEAVES:

My answer to that is I believe that

7

if the judge stated the evidence is insufficient, as -- as

8

the judge did in Smalis, as the trier of fact and law, I

9

find the evidence -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MS. NEAVES:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The minute -

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What if in the case -

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- the minute he -

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- we have before us the State

It's over.

It's over.

It's over.

16

allowed an interlocutory appeal on behalf of the

17

prosecution right after the judge's ruling?

18

MS. NEAVES:

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MS. NEAVES:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In a jury case, Your Honor?
Yes.

I think Conceivably they could allow

22

an interlocutory appeal from a judgment of acquittal at

23

the close of the prosecution's case.

24
25

MS. NEAVES:

If such a -- if such a process

could be put in place where there was an appellate panel

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that would be willing and available to hear that while the

2

jury remained empaneled, I don't think it would run afoul

3

of the Double Jeopardy Clause.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But is that necessary?

I -- I

6

mean, that's what I think is the difficult question here.

7

Can you say that it's final for purposes of the decision-

8

maker outside that courtroom, namely an appellate court,

9

but it's not final in respect to the judge having a right

10

to change his mind within the court?

11

lot of sense to me, but I don't know if it's possible to

12

get there.

13

Why not?

That -- that makes a

I -- I think, well, the reason is that

14

you want judges to be able to reconsider things and you

15

don't have that problem when you're talking about an

16

appeal.

17

MS. NEAVES:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is Or is there any -- is there

19

any, in other words, to reconcile our case that you're

20

talking about, Smalis?

21

MS. NEAVES:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MS. NEAVES:

The Smalis case?
Yes, yes.

I think there are a number of ways

24

to reconcile it.

25

that it's the difference between a bench trial and a jury

Certainly Massachusetts' position is

trial, but there is also no doubt that the case left the

2

trial court and went up on appeal.

3

factors are significant.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I think both of those

No, but isn't -- isn't the

5

significance supposedly the existence or nonexistence of

6

our continuation of the jury panel, going back to Justice

7

Stevens' question?

8

had a procedure whereby the trial judge would simply

9

decline to discharge the jury panel if an appeal were

And what if the -- what if the State

10

taken from the acquittal motion so that if he was tipped

11

over, it could come right back to the same jury panel?

12

Would -- would the -- would the answer have to be

13

different?

14

MS. NEAVES:

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MS. NEAVES:

I don't think it would.
Why?

I think -- I think for a -- I think

17

for my -- to my way of thinking about the cases, the jury

18

is what matters and it's the defendant's right to his

19

particular tribunal, and that's the first jury that's

20

empaneled -

21
22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but on my hypothesis he's

going to get the same jury.

23

MS. NEAVES:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

MS. NEAVES:

Exactly.
They have not been discharged.

Exactly.

So I would say that it

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would not be a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause,

2

and that's why -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wow.

It goes all the way up on

4

appeal and the jury -- I -- I don't know what the -- I

5

guess he lets the jury go home for a couple of months or

6

while the appeal is pending and then when the decision is

7

overturned by the court of appeals, he comes back and

8

recommences the trial?

9

Wow.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

If that's so, then

10

why shouldn't Smalis have gone the other way?

11

they can send it right back to exactly the same judge.

12
13

MS. NEAVES:

Because he -- he is the trier of

fact, and I think at that point -

14
15

Because

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the jury is the trier of

fact.

16

MS. NEAVES:

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's I mean, on the hypothesis

18

before, you're saying if they don't discharge the jury and

19

it can go back to them, no double jeopardy problem.

20

Smalis, it's going to be the same judge.

21

trial.

22

In

It was a bench

It should have come out the other way.
MS. NEAVES:

Well, I think the difference is the

-- the judge in Smalis was the trier of fact.

24

rule -- he is both the trier of fact and the law-giver.

25

He's decided that the evidence is insufficient.

He made a

MS. NEAVES:

Well, he certainly had some sense

of reliance, but it wasn't a double jeopardy reliance.

5

And I would -- I would point the Court to -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, if the Double

7

Jeopardy Clause did apply, if it were treated as a true

8

acquittal, he could just say, well, we can forget about

9

that, send your witnesses home, we won't have to worry

10

about it.

11

I understand under your view they could send the

12

witnesses home, and a week -- a week later the judge could

say, well, we haven't submitted it to the jury, I've

14

decided to change my mind.

17

You could bring all those

That's the way you think it should work.

MS. NEAVES:

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

And I

think -

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what about a judge who

thinks -- should the judge -- should a judge in trial be

20

able to change his mind as long as the jury is still

there?

Yes.

22

MS. NEAVES:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Should you be able to take an

24

appeal in the same circumstance while the jury is still

there?

No.

Now, suppose a judge thinks both those things.
Is that judge, like me, for example, hopelessly confused?

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is the judge thinking

5

contradictory things or is there a way of reconciling

6

those two instincts?

7

MS. NEAVES:

I -- Justice Breyer, I -- I

8

certainly believe that the -- that the double jeopardy

9

rule that we're -- we're advocating would permit that, but

10

I -- I think that most trial judges would not be very

11

pleased about doing something like that.

12

speaking, there's -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And practically

By the way, if it's

MS. NEAVES:

I think it -- I -- well, it's -

it's -- I think if -- I think if you accept the notion

3

that jury discharge is what matters for purposes of the

4

Double Jeopardy Clause and permitting a trial judge to

5

reconsider a legal ruling up to that point, then if a

6

State court could fashion an interlocutory review process

7

of that legal ruling, that would not violate the Double

8

Jeopardy Clause.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What is the conceptual basis

10

for saying that jury discharge makes the difference?

11

is that the touchstone?

12

MS. NEAVES:

Why

I think this Court has said over

13

and over again that it is the jury -- the defendant's

14

right to hold onto his chosen jury that matters in a

15

number of different contexts in the double jeopardy area.

16

This Court has drawn the line at attachment of jeopardy

17

when the jury is empaneled and sworn based on the

18

historical value of a defendant having that particular

19

jury resolve the government's case against him.

it is the sort of prejudice that falls within the rubric

of due process and -- and --

deus ex machina of the Due Process Clause.

the judge's dismissal, and which this defendant had every

reason to rely upon as being the end of that part of the

I'm inclined to say if -- if that is a problem, in

5

motion for acquittal.

6

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No.

We -- we think that the

and to bench trials such that an appeal, an interlocutory

20

appeal, in the midst of a jury trial would not be

21

22

basis for drawing a distinction between -

23

But we also think that there is a sound

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But my question is assuming a

State procedure in which the interlocutory appeal was

25

permissible, you -- you would say Double Jeopardy Clause

MR. SRINIVASAN:

3

be the holding of Smalis.

4

Right, because we read that to

But we think there's a basis for distinguishing

5

between appeals on one hand and continuing proceedings

6

before the initial tribunal on the other hand.

7

all, this Court has drawn that distinction in Swisher v.

8

Brady where it initially said that the two-stage system of

9

adjudication is -- in Maryland that was at issue in that

First of

10

case was permissible because it entailed continued

11

proceedings before the initial tribunal rather than an

12

appeal to a second tribunal.

13

distinguished its prior decisions in Jenkins v. the United

14

States and Kepner, both of which involved appellate

15

review.

And the Court specifically

16

And the other basis for drawing a distinction

17

between appeals on one hand and reconsiderations by the

18

trial court on the other is historical tradition.

19

the Court could look to history and history would show

20

that on one hand trial courts have always had inherent

21

authority to reconsider their mid-trial rulings because

22

the practical exigencies of trial are such that trial

23

courts inevitably will err on occasion, and the ends of

24

justice require trial courts to have the authority to

25

revisit their mid-trial rulings.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would -- would you allow a

2

trial judge to reopen -- to -- to permit the prosecution

3

to reopen the case?

4

MR. SRINIVASAN:

We would, Justice Kennedy, but

5

it raises a distinct problem because one value that's

6

served by the Double Jeopardy Clause is the defendant's

7

interest in preventing the prosecution from honing its

8

evidentiary case by repeated efforts.

9

judge were permitted to reopen the case to give the

And if the trial

10

prosecution that opportunity, it at least would implicate

11

that interest.

12

Now, we still think that the proper line is jury

13

discharge, but we understand that that hypothetical would

14

present a distinct interest.

15

Now, with respect to historical tradition on

16

appeals, the historical tradition is clear that the

17

government has lacked authority at common law to take an

18

appeal in a criminal proceeding.

19

that common law tradition as early as Sanges v. the United

20

States and it's repeated that understanding in Carroll v.

21

the United States and Arizona v. Manypenny, and that's why

22

the Court construes statutory grants of authority to the

23

government to take an appeal in criminal cases quite

24

narrowly.

distinction between reconsiderations by the trial court

This Court relied on

Court often looks at history to shape the contours of

double jeopardy protections.

4

case -- the Court a basis for saying that in Smalis, while

5

appeals were forbidden, in this case trial court

6

reconsideration should be permitted.

7

And that would afford the

And I think the lens through which the Court

8

would do that under the Double Jeopardy Clause is the

9

valued interest in giving the prosecution one full and

10

fair opportunity to prove its case in the sense that while

11

that full and fair opportunity may exclude an appeal,

12

because the Court held as much in Smalis, it doesn't

13

exclude reconsiderations.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why -- why doesn't the -- the

15

prosecution gets its full and fair opportunity if we have

16

a rule that says to trial judges, when you make a ruling

17

on acquittal, you better be serious and you better not

18

make a snap judgment, think it over, because once you've

19

done it, it sticks?

20

have a perfectly fair opportunity under that rule?

21

Everybody knows where he stands and judges, we hope, are

22

going to be careful.

23

Why -- why doesn't the prosecution

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Justice Souter, we think a

24

constitutional rule that would turn on the definitiveness

25

of a trial court ruling would be flawed in three respects.

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

First, the line between a definitive ruling and

2

a tentative ruling is not altogether clear, and we've

3

outlined in our brief at page 24 in a lengthy footnote a

4

variety of factual scenarios that come from real cases

5

where trial judges, as they often do, rendered a ruling on

6

a motion for acquittal orally, and whether you think that

7

ruling was definitive or tentative might depend on which

8

page of the transcript you happen to be looking at.

9

But even if we're dealing with a situation in

10

which the ruling clearly falls on the definitive side of

11

the line, you'd still have the problem that a trial court

12

might be convinced that it's correct and rule definitively

13

but still be incorrect.

14

That's why this issue comes up as often as it does.

15

example, in this case -

16

Trial courts make mistakes.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

For

All these cases -- we've

had several, not too many over the -- the whole line of

2

these double jeopardy claims arise in cases in which the

later, you say, gee, he goofed.

should consider the plainness of the error or the fact

example, we cite a decision of the Washington Supreme

Court, State v. Collins, which involves essentially the

that after the trial judge initially announced her ruling,

the prosecution had the precedent in hand and within a

her error and to correct her ruling and reinstate the

MR. SRINIVASAN:

It -- there -- there -- that

13

would be the basis of a claim, Justice Souter, but the

14

right to rely is, in essence, a notice prejudice sort of

15

claim and that could be handled in the way that trial

16

courts typically handle claims by the defendant that

17

they've detrimentally relied on an initial ruling the

18

trial court has subsequently reconsidered.

19

It would be equally the case, for example, as

20

the State mentioned with respect to an evidentiary ruling

21

that barred the prosecution from introducing a category of

22

evidence, but then the trial judge, later in the

23

proceedings, wanted to revisit that ruling.

24

would be whether revisiting the ruling resulted in

25

prejudice to the defendant because the defendant had

Right?

It can't be discharge of the

foremost, in defining a line for bench trials, if the
