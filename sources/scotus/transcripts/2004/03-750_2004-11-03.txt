ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. BOAS

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. BOAS:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

9

This case presents the issue of whether, when

10

deciding the meaning of a statute, we will focus, as the

11

Government suggests, on two words only, any court, or

12

whether we will look at the statute as a whole, whether we

13

will consider the statute as a symmetrical and coherent

14

regulatory scheme and decide the meaning of the statute by

15

appreciating how sections relate to one another.

16

In this particular case, 922(g)(1) of 18 U.S.

17

Code is a -- represents a merger of two old sections,

18

title IV and title VII, that were passed in 1968 in the

19

Omnibus Crime Control Act.

20

statute, we had two redundant and overlapping sections,

21

and one talked about prohibiting persons who have been

22

convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than

23

a year.

24

convicted in any court of the United States or a State of

25

a felony.

In -- in those -- in that

One, title VII, talked about prohibiting persons

There were different penalties, slightly

different classes of people.

2

receiver; title VII more on the possessor.

3

nothing about the -- these two titles, about the

4

legislative history suggests that Congress at any time

5

meant something different from the term, any court, in

6

title IV and any court of the United States in title VII.

7

Title IV focused more on the
But nothing --

And when these two were merged in 1986 in the

8

Firearms Owners' Protection Act, again, nothing suggests,

9

nothing in the comments, nothing in the statute, that

10

these two terms -- that the elimination of the language,

11

any court of the United States, was --

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I guess we have held,

13

though, several times that Congress meant to define very

14

broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm

15

statutes.

16
17
18

Did we not?
MR. BOAS:

O'Connor.

That's -- that's correct, Justice

However -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So it makes it a tougher case

19

when you use the word any because we've given the -- the

20

word any generally a broad definition.

21

MR. BOAS:

Well, earlier this year in the Nixon

22

case, this Court said that when we look at any -- and that

23

was a case dealing with the meaning of any entity.

24

mean any entity, public or private, or any private entity?

25

The Court said any can and does mean different things

Did it

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

depending upon the setting, and the Court said when using

2

it broadly would lead to strange and indeterminate

3

results, we'll give it a more narrow reading, which the

4

Court did.

5

Now, you're right, Justice O'Connor.

This Court

6

has said that the purpose of the felon in possession

7

statute was to be broad and sweeping, but the Government

8

reiterates that view, citing repeatedly three cases,

9

Scarborough, Bass, and Lewis, and all three of those cases

10

in which the Court referred to Congress' comments and this

11

Court's own comments about the broad sweep of the statute

12

were 1202(a) cases.

13

the Court said this is a broad statute, each one of those

14

cases, Lewis, Bass, and Scarborough, were cases where by

15

definition the prohibition was against persons convicted

16

in any court of the United States or a State.

17

language doesn't help the Government at all because those

18

were 1202(a) cases which limited specifically the Court to

19

any court of the United States.

20

And so notwithstanding the fact that

So that

So to take the -- and I -- and -- the simplistic

21

view that as the -- as the Fourth and Sixth Circuit did

22

and as the Government does here, that any means any,

23

without regard to the rest of the statute, is simply -- is

24

-- is too narrow a focus.

25

Let's look at the statute.

It's true that the

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

word -- the term, the two words, any court, is not

2

defined.

3

term, crime punishable by more than a year, is defined.

4

And so what we should really be focusing on is the phrase,

5

convicted in any court of a crime punishable by more than

6

a year.

7

punishable by more than a year, excludes any State or

8

Federal antitrust or business regulatory offense.

But if we look in the definitions section, the

And that definition says the term, crime

9

Now, if we exclude from the definition of crime

10

punishable by more than a year and the Government's -- if

11

we exclude from that any State or Federal antitrust law

12

and the Government's interpretation is adopted, then we're

13

left with the anomalous result that if a person is

14

convicted of an antitrust offense in this country, they're

15

allowed to possess a firearm.

16

in France or England, they can't.

17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

If they're convicted of one

Are there any such cases?

I

mean, I never heard actually --

19

MR. BOAS:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.
-- when people -- no.

I mean,

21

are there any cases in which France or England has

22

convicted people of an antitrust violation punishable by

23

imprisonment for more than a year?

24

that their antitrust laws had a criminal aspect, though I

25

haven't looked it up.

I -- I didn't know

MR. BOAS:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Nor have I -Fine.

Well, I -- I've never

heard if anyone in any foreign country, other than ours,

though I gather my law clerk found that in Japan, in fact,

5

Japan does have a criminal antitrust law.

6

only ones outside the United States, and I don't know that

7

anyone has ever been convicted under it because they're

8

not too -- or they didn't used to be too fierce on

9

antitrust enforcement.

10

MR. BOAS:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

They may be the

Well, 921(20) or -I'm just wondering how

anomalous or your anomaly is.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. BOAS:

15

excludes antitrust offenses, it excludes any business

16

regulatory offense.

Yes.

this anomaly exists?

business regulatory crimes throughout the world.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why did they say any State or

2

Federal?

3

you may say that the -- that the substantive effect of the

4

provision supports your interpretation, but the text of

5

the provision supports the Government's --

I mean, in -- in a way this provision -- you --

6

MR. BOAS:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well --- because if any only means

8

State or Federal, there was no need to say State or

9

Federal in this provision.

You could have simply said any

10

in this provision, just as you said it elsewhere.

11

would think that they said State or Federal because they

12

wanted to exclude foreign antitrust matters.

13

MR. BOAS:

So one

Well, this same limitation, Justice

14

Scalia, existed as a limitation under 1202(a) where any

15

court said any State or Federal court and the exclusion

16

said any State or Federal court.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's consistent --

Well, I don't care how it got

18

there.

19

means what you said it means, namely State or Federal,

20

there would have been no need to limit this other

21

provision to State or Federal because the whole statute

22

would only cover State or Federal.

23

I'm just saying there -- there -- if -- if any

MR. BOAS:

Well, but at some point in the

24

statute, Congress has to give an indication of their

25

intent, and this is where it is.

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

For example, there's another limitation

2

immediately following it which says it shall also not

3

include any State offense which is described as a

4

misdemeanor in the State and carries no more than 2 years.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

Well, but -- but Justice

6

Scalia's point -- and I -- I think he's correct -- is that

7

this cuts at least as much in favor of the Government as

8

you and probably more because you would make Federal and

9

State unnecessary surplus.

10
11
12

MR. BOAS:

Well, there has to be some

indication -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You don't -- you don't set

13

forth the main qualification to the main definition in a

14

-- in a later subsection.

15

MR. BOAS:

Well, if we go further with 921(20),

16

there's another limitation that again clearly deals with

17

States, and that's the restoration of civil rights

18

provision.

19

that was an effort to essentially statutorily reverse the

20

Dickerson v. Banner Institute case -- that that applies to

21

State situations.

22

State pardon or his record is expunged, that wouldn't be a

23

disqualifying factor.

24

foreign state being what determines whether it's a

25

conviction or not.

The Government concedes in their brief -- and

The idea that if a person receives a

And they talk about the law of the

Now, clearly we're not looking at

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

going to some pardon process in Germany or Uruguay to

2

decide whether a person still has a conviction.

3

Another part of the statute that's very clear,

4

924(e)(1).

5

That section says that if a person's who's convicted under

6

922(g)(1), our statute, and has three prior serious drug

7

convictions in a court described in 922(g)(1), then they

8

get 15 years.

9

conviction is a State or Federal conviction.

That's the armed career criminal section.

Now, that definition of serious drug

10

Now, let's flip over to 21 U.S.C. 802(44), the

11

drug statute where you have a similar recidivist type of

12

statute where you go from a 5-year mandatory to a 10-year

13

mandatory if you have a prior drug conviction.

14

802(44), a serious drug offense is defined as a State,

15

Federal, or foreign drug offense.

16

can differentiate when it wants to.

17

Now, they're --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we see that Congress

other places.

terminology?

Because

Shouldn't they be -- be consistent in their

MR. BOAS:

Well, perhaps they should be more

24

consistent, Justice Ginsburg, but the overall -- I mean,

Mr. Boas, I think you make a

strong argument that Congress probably didn't think of

this particular problem.

hearings before the committee, the process of the

Do you suppose if at the

10

legislation, some witness came in and said, do you realize

11

this language is so broad it will cover the person who is

12

convicted of a felony in Japan, as well as person who's

13

convicted of a felony in Illinois, do you think they would

14

have modified the statute?

15

MR. BOAS:

I think they would have.

I think

16

that -- I don't concede that there was really a need to,

17

but I think they would have because they would have said

18

it's --

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, there would have been a

20

need to under your view now.

21

MR. BOAS:

That's right.

But they would have

22

historically going back to '68 and before, we always

23

intended this to just cover domestic situations.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I suppose somebody on the

committee might have said, well, we don't want this kind

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

1

of person to have a gun, and the fact he's convicted in

2

Japan rather than in Brooklyn really doesn't make any

3

difference with regard to the purpose of the statute.

4

MR. BOAS:

If the individual is convicted in

5

Japan, Justice Stevens, then he would not be under our

6

immigration laws allowed to come to this country, and if

7

he did come --

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. BOAS:

10

Well, but this person --

-- he'd be an illegal alien.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But the defendant in this case

11

was convicted in Japan and he somehow got to the United

12

States.

13
14

MR. BOAS:

Well, because he's an American

citizen.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. BOAS:

Well --

So -- but Congress can't cure every

17

problem that exists in the world, and this statute is

18

fairly comprehensive.

I think Congress would say the perils

Plus the Government, it seems to me, should put on its

3

form that this includes foreign conviction, and that

4

solves that problem.

MR. BOAS:

Well, but what if it's a foreign

conviction where there's no due process?

checklist that in that foreign conviction, did you have a

8

jury, did you have the right to confront your accuser, did

you have the right to remain silent?

to realize that the Government's position that any

what's very important to me is that 924(e)(1) says if you

And frankly, to the extent it's not totally

2

clear and it could go either way, I think then the rule of

3

lenity requires that it be decided with a more narrow

4

construction, that is, that any court meant any court of

5

the State or of the United States.

6

I believe it was in the -- in the '90's when

7

this Court's opinion, authored by Justice Thomas in I

There was some sloppy

drafting here and it could have been more clear, but when

we look at the statute as a whole and try to harmonize the

various parts of that statute, it would be almost absurd

22

to think, when we look -- and -- and maybe these anomalies

23

won't occur all the time, as you point out, Justice

24

Breyer, but it would almost be absurd to think that with

all of these limitations, exclusions, when we run down the

that while we're debating how American citizens should be

But Justice Breyer, I understand this being a

14

very important concern, and -- and there are no doubt

15

particular applications that could seem unappealing, just

16

as in Lewis v. United States where this Court held that an

17

invalid, a patently unconstitutional State conviction

18

counts for section 922(g)(1).

fact, be unconstitutionally entered.

They could have been

the product of a coerced confession.

The allegation there

was lack of representation of counsel.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that -- that example,

which you gave in your brief, gave me this concern.

10

problem that you've just been describing, the State

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

imagine that in our criminal system it doesn't work the

MS. MILLETT:

Well, certainly in immigration and

extradition, you don't get to appeal the validity of your

14

foreign conviction or the -- the processes that led to it.

15

So this is not an alien concept.

18

And it's very important to understand what
Congress was doing here.

This isn't --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm asking if it's alien in

19

our criminal justice system, not in deportation, not in --

20

extradition is somebody who did somebody -- something

21

abroad, and we don't send people just to anyplace.

22

we have to have a treaty?

23

MS. MILLETT:

Right.

Don't

We have treaties with more

24

than 100 countries and we don't -- and -- and the courts

do not examine the fairness of the proceedings or --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because the person is going

2

to be tried in that other system, and we have bound --

3

within our international system, we say we're part of a

4

world community and we want Japan to extradite people who

5

have done bad things here to the United States, and so

6

similarly, we will extradite to Japan.

7

to look at our system and judge it.

8

somebody to be tried there.

9

something entirely different than --

10

MS. MILLETT:

We don't want them

extradite, just to serve sentences, where there may have

already been a trial that could be as flawed as anyone

could conceive or articulate.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -Well, we have the check

15

already that these are -- these are places with whom we want

16

to do criminal justice business together.

17

MS. MILLETT:

So --

Well, what we have is the check

18

that the political branches have decided that it's

19

important to attach significance to foreign court --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then we have the -- we

have the document where it's very clear we want to have

court, then that would be it, but it hasn't said that and

2

we have to determine does it mean the same thing as it

3

means in the extradition context or the deportation

4

context where you have a clear statement that Congress

5

means a tribunal abroad.

6

MS. MILLETT:

In fact, in 8 U.S.C. 1182(a) which

7

-- which -- admissibility criterion for aliens,

8

convictions of moral turpitude, there's no reference to

9

whether it's a conviction by a foreign court or a domestic

10
11

court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if somebody is coming

12

into the country, somebody is asking to come in, any

13

conviction that you're talking about, of course, refers to

14

someplace abroad.

15

MS. MILLETT:

No.

No, it doesn't, Justice

16

Ginsburg, because frequently and throughout that same

17

statute, it refers to convictions in the United States.

18

lot of times the reason for inadmissibility, including the

19

Mariel Cubans cases this Court heard last month, is -- is

20

convictions committed in the United States.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And I think

There has been no

And how are we to decide

whether such tribunal should be treated as a court within

10

the meaning of the statute when there is no statutory

11

definition of the term court?

12

MS. MILLETT:

Through traditional rules of

13

statutory construction.

14

looking at the other -- the -- the background that

15

Congress would have enacted the statute against, first of

16

all, and that -- that may well have -- it may not have

17

been courts of just the United States because, as we know,

18

Congress twice deleted that limitation from the statute.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if you concede that there

are some tribunals that are not courts within the meaning

of the statute, are you not conceding that the word court

is inherently ambiguous?

23

MS. MILLETT:

I -- I am -- I am conceding that

-- that it has to be given meaning.

25

would call it ambiguous, if we have to figure out.

be a court capable of entering convictions.

don't think it's ambiguous in a sense --

If -- if somebody asked where

this man was convicted, they'd say in a Japanese court.

addition, we don't decide that a word is ambiguous just at

looking at that word.

books for so long with very, very few prosecutions.

to the attention of Congress, they would have defined the

probably because they didn't think of the problem.

carefully and deal with matters with which it was familiar

No, but how -- how familiar an

example is it that price-fixers would -- would be placed

And yet, Congress dealt with it.

11

MS. MILLETT:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, the problem -And if it can deal with a

problem that is as little pressing as that, it seems odd

that it would not have averted in any way to equally non-

Senate's definition of felony.

The other thing to keep in mind is when Congress

enacted this statute in 1968, it also enacted an

administrative mechanism for relief that would deal with

exactly the uncomfortable situations that have been

identified.

You know, this is a very

interesting case because there are three ways to answer

the question of what is a court.

fill in a hole in the statute.

we should knock out this -- interpret the statute in the

But, Justice Kennedy and Justice

Stevens, the important thing to keep in mind here is we

don't just have a statute that appeared out of nowhere.

It's been on the books for a long time and there was a

legislative --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but it is pretty clear

that Congress didn't really think about this problem.

MS. MILLETT:

No, but it thought -- it -And it is also clear on your

side that they would like to prevent this guy from having

Exactly, and -So there are two competing

considerations, both of which are very powerful.
MS. MILLETT:

Well, if nothing else -- and this

22

guy is squarely within what Congress wanted to capture.

23

If nothing else, you don't have to decide anything more in

24

this case than that it covers persons like this whose

25

convictions are fundamentally fair and it's not contested

about -- and really what led the Sentencing Commission to
