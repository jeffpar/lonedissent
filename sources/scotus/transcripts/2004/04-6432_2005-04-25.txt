Mr. Rashkind.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. RASHKIND

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. RASHKIND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We confront today the Eleventh Circuit's

11

categorical and jurisdictional prohibition of rule 60(b)

12

in habeas corpus cases absent fraud.

13

has been rejected by nearly all of the other circuits and,

14

in fact, has been rejected by the United States in its

15

amicus brief filed in this case.

16

That is a rule that

We urge the Court to adopt instead the approach

17

of the other nine circuits that have commented on this

18

issue, the functional approach, in which a court is deemed

19

to examine each motion individually to determine whether

20

or not the motion comports with both rule 60(b) and AEDPA.

21

I think the test we proposed here is a fairly

22

simple one, although I'm not sure in the briefing it comes

23

across as being as simple as it really is, but the test we

24

are proposing, as opposed to the test proposed by the

25

United States, is the one being used in nearly all of the

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

other circuits and it has percolated through the system as

2

one that seems to work very well.

3

and it's very simple I think.

4

It's a two-part test

First, does the motion that's filed challenge

5

the Federal judgment on a ground cognizable under one of

6

the six prongs of rule 60(b)?

7

new claim, if it is not within one of the six prongs of

8

rule 60(b), then simply the district court denies it.

9

If, on the other hand, the motion is a true

If not, if it's really a

10

60(b) motion, as ours was in this case, then the court

11

goes to step two, which is to examine which is the six

12

prongs is implicated, what is the jurisprudence regarding

13

the six -- that particular prong, and how would it apply

14

in this particular case.

15

that most of the circuits have been using.

16

That's the functional approach

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At that point when the court

17

makes that examination under your rule and it comes to

18

point six -

19

MR. RASHKIND:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
-- does it refer at any point

21

or in any circumstance to AEDPA?

22

MR. RASHKIND:

It does not but -- but point six

23

has been cabined by jurisprudence.

24

appears to be a wide-open door for any motion to be filed

25

and granted, the courts, even before AEDPA, have treated

Although point six

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

category six as one that requires extraordinary

2

circumstances.

3

We have been able to quantify.

Both an amicus

4

who filed on behalf of the petitioner and the United

5

States and the respondent have quantified the number of

6

cases that have gone through the rule 60(b) process.

7

There have only been, since AEDPA was passed, 28

8

successful motions that we can quantify, that are

9

published in any way.

And we would like to think, at

10

least, that if the State or the Federal Government thought

11

there was an inappropriate application, it would have been

12

raised on appeal and we'd have that statistic.

13

9-year history of the statute means fewer than 3 per year

14

-- or slightly more than 3 per year for the whole country,

15

a fraction for circuits.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

28 in the

Well, if we were to make

17

clear that 60(b) is widely available, even category six,

18

don't you think -- and as a result the AEDPA restrictions

19

don't apply, don't you think that number would increase

20

rather dramatically?

21

MR. RASHKIND:

I do not.

And I do not because

22

at this point apparently nine circuits are following the

23

rule we propose, and so the statistics that both the

24

respondent that we bring to you are that small, are that

25

infinitesimal because the courts have always treated 60(b)

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

as a last ditch, extraordinary circumstances required.

2

One can go through each of the six prongs and easily

3

hypothesize examples that are appropriate, (b)(1),

4

(b)(2) -

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, there's no language in

6

category six referring to extraordinary circumstances, any

7

other reason justifying relief.

8
9

MR. RASHKIND:

The Court in the Ackermann

decision -- there were two early decisions construing

10

60(b).

11

Court recognized that 60(b) is intended to correct the

12

kind of errors that might occur that are important.

13

Ackermann decision followed a year later and said,

14

however, this is not a wide-open door.

15

circumstances are required.

16
17
18

The first was the Klapprott decision in which the

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

The

Extraordinary

But it's still very

vague.
MR. RASHKIND:

It is but it isn't.

It's vague

19

in terms of reading the simple rule, but it's not vague if

20

one considers the jurisprudence that surrounds the rule.

21

One cannot ignore a half-century of -- of decisions, which

22

have rejected 60(b)(6) and other 60(b) -

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

All that is true, but I think

24

that the court below and the other parties say -- almost

25

everybody is on your side.

However, they also note a

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

problem, and the problem is that given the very rigid

2

structure of AEDPA and the imagination of lawyers, that if

3

60(b) hasn't proved an escape hatch for getting around the

4

AEDPA restriction, it will, and that what the lawyers will

5

do is they will reconstruct what they'd like as a second

6

habeas and put it in the form of a 60(b).

7

And so I can accept everything you say, but if

8

that in the back of my mind is a concern running around

9

Congress in this way, what form of words could you put in

10

to restrict 60(b) to its domain which is the domain in

11

which it's been used so far?

12

Now, the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation filed

13

a brief in which they tried to do that.

14

was a constructive effort.

15

MR. RASHKIND:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. RASHKIND:

I thought that

So what's your opinion -

Well, I would -- about how best to do that?
I would prefer to rely upon the

18

Court's principles in this regard.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. RASHKIND:

No, but that's Rhines -- Rhines v. Weber is of

21

good help here.

22

just very recently, considered the interaction of a rule

23

and of AEDPA, and I thought it very clearly set forth

24

three principles which work well within the test here.

25

Rhines v. Weber, that the Court delivered

First, that there has to be good cause and good

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

cause, of course, is clear in the jurisprudence here, that

2

we're talking about extraordinary circumstances, not a

3

simple legal error.

4

extraordinary circumstance is that, for all intents and

5

purposes, my client has been denied his first petition of

6

right because the court foreclosed the issues erroneously.

7

So good cause is the first thing that I learned from

8

Rhines.

9

In this case, for example, the

Secondly, that there have to be potentially

10

meritorious underlying issues.

11

filter out a lot of the cases because you can't come into

12

court with another issue that might not be good, it

13

mightn't be an unexhausted issue, it might be -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. RASHKIND:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

Potentially meritorious?
MR. RASHKIND:

Now, that's going to

It's pretty flabby.
-- one procedurally defaulted.
It's pretty flabby.
Not probably, potentially.
Well, it is -- it is the

19

terminology used in Rhines.

20

here for the Court is to draw upon your own authority, the

21

words you've spoken, as opposed to the test proposed by

22

the Criminal Justice Foundation and by the United States,

23

which are interesting tests but in no way depend upon the

24

Court's own jurisprudence.

25

its own tests that have worked.

And what I'm trying to do

I'm trying to offer the Court

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But this is going to

2

be taken up by some 800 district judges and a couple

3

hundred appellate judges, and they're the ones who have

4

the final say in most of these cases just because we

5

decide so few.

MR. RASHKIND:
works.

9

The third point would be that there be
timeliness.

10
11

And I think that's why this test

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, aren't we dealing here

with a time bar issue?

12

MR. RASHKIND:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

We are.
I mean, there -- there was

14

not a determination below, but an extraordinary amount of

15

time expired before the application was made.

16

that count as some extraordinary circumstance?

17

shouldn't the petitioner be stuck with the time bar?

18

don't see how this fits even under your proposed rule.

I was going to ask the same

MR. RASHKIND:

I mean, this is not a

It really isn't as pedestrian as

24

it may have seemed.

25

AEDPA, that the Court has recognized is not fully clear.

We underwent a change in the law, in

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And so this was one provision the Court had to clarify in

2

Artuz v. Bennett, and there was a very small number of

3

cases.

4

granted because district courts had incorrectly barred a

5

petitioner from the first petition because it really

6

wasn't a violation of -- of the statute of limitations.

I think we totaled eight in which relief was

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8

relief in -- in the post-conviction?

9

that looks like it might apply is that Florida had a 2

10

year statute of limitations and this was brought up 14

11

years later.

12

MR. RASHKIND:

Why -- why did Florida deny
I mean, one reason

Well, it wasn't a 2-year statute

13

of limitations, Your Honor.

14

different from the Federal statute of limitations as well.

15

There is a provision that allows for newly discovered

16

evidence to bypass the standard 2-year statute of

17

limitations, which by the way, the Florida statute of

18

limitations wasn't even adopted until well after my client

19

was convicted.

20

In fact, it was slightly

As you know, he says that he was told at his

21

sentencing proceeding, you'll serve 13 years, thereabouts,

22

on a 99-year sentence, and that induced his plea of guilty

23

in this case.

24

what's happening and they said, no, that's not going to

25

happen.

And when 13 years came about, he inquired

You have a release date of 2057.

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And as I think the Court knows from its decision

2

in Linz v. Mathis, Florida -- Florida statutes really

3

changed in that way.

4

then much more quickly so that someone who might have

5

served 13 years in 1982 is really looking at serving the

6

99.

7

Gain time was reduced gradually and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you saying that counsel

8

-- what -- what he alleges counsel told him was, in fact,

9

accurate at the time counsel said it, that somebody who

10

got a 99-year sentence wouldn't have to serve more than 13

11

years?

12

MR. RASHKIND:

To be clear -- and -- and I want

13

to be clear about his allegation is -- because he does not

14

speak English -- that the interpreter told him this, and

15

this was not during a plea colloquy.

16

discussions between the lawyer and the client through an

17

interpreter in advance of the plea itself.

18

allegation has consistently been that that's what the

19

interpreter told him his lawyer said.

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

MR. RASHKIND:

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

And so his

And it's never been.
And so we have to know how

6

the time bar element folds in here, and in an ordinary

civil case, a time bar would be an adjudication on the

8

merits.

9

would it be a different, more liberal rule in habeas?

10
11

MR. RASHKIND:

It is because that's the way the

Court has treated the rule.

I mean, that -- that would end the case, and why

That's an affirmative defense of

Counsel, what -- that -

that brings me to a question that I don't understand about

8

me as though you would.

9

you're not making it.

It seems to me you're biting off more than
Would you win on the following

And I will tell you in advance that it looks to
But maybe there's some reason

10

Number one, your statute of limitations claim is

11

not the kind of claim that AEDPA is concerned with when it

12

deals with limits on second and successive petitions.

13

Number two, although a statute of limitations

14

issue is on the merits, it is not on the merits in the

15

second or successive petition category.

16

don't have to worry about making a -- an -- an AEDPA end

17

run so far as second or successive goes, and therefore,

18

60(b) can be used simply not as a wide-open door, but as a

19

door that could be opened when your claim is a claim about

20

a rule that barred you from getting into Federal court,

21

which is what the statute of limitations rule does.

22

That's all you're asking for.

23

MR. RASHKIND:

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

In this case, you

That's right.
And finally, you have an

extraordinary situation here because you have a later

determination in Artuz which declared the law not as a

2

change in the law, but as what the law presumably meant

3

from day one.

4
5

As I understand it, if we accepted that
argument, you would win.

6

MR. RASHKIND:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

8

Do you agree?
Yes, sir.
Then why don't you make that

argument?

9

MR. RASHKIND:

I do make that argument, and to

10

the extent -- and -- and I make that argument, but that

11

argument was rejected in the court below which addressed

12

it with a completely different approach.

13

in this Court by having to address where I was in the

14

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but your -- your immediate

concern is how do I get into a Federal court.

with here.

Whether you

you can say -- if you argue all I've got in front of you,

under -- to raise under 60(b) and I have an extraordinary

claim here because of the subsequent Artuz decision, that

You -- you had a question.

6

Remember my -- you were giving me the three principles to

prevent the end run.

MR. RASHKIND:

And the first was good cause.

10

The second was potentially meritorious underlying issues,

11

and the third is?

13

MR. RASHKIND:

No indication of dilatory tactics

by the plaintiff.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. RASHKIND:

Thank you.
And this is very helpful I think

16

because it gives those three rules, which the Court has

17

given us in Rhines, helped us and helped the district

18

court to sort out the things that shouldn't be stopping or

19

reopening proceedings.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May -- may I ask you a

21

question that may be a little bit collateral?

22

disagreement on the court of appeals, as I remember it, as

23

to whether or not a COA requirement applies to a denial of

24

a 60(b) motion.

25

There was

What is your view on that issue?

MR. RASHKIND:

1

believe that it shouldn't require a COA.

2

is because -- part of the reason is because this case

3

began before Slack v. McDaniel and continued after.

4

think that's where Judge Tjoflat's opinion came from.

5

can someone whose case is dismissed procedurally ever get

6

a COA?

a constitutional issue.

impossible, in the typical case of a procedural resolution

13

of the case, to ever get a COA.

14

In this case, majority would point to the

15

fact the my client did receive a certificate of

16

appealability, but I don't think there are many others who

17

will every get it because the question presented was, is a

18

rule 60(b) still viable post AEDPA?

won't recur, certainly not after the Court rules here.

And I think the very genuine concern that Judge Tjoflat

21

had was and that he -- that he articulated is it's

22

virtually impossible to get appellate review.

Then, of

But what has happened to the appeal in a habeas

16

corpus case is it has become so constrained that in many

17

respects it doesn't exist, and that's what happened here.

18

Here's my client who faces a situation in which he has

19

clearly been thrown out of court improperly, and he goes

20

to the court of appeals to have that decision reviewed and

21

can't get past the gateway of the certificate of

appealability.

that's the concern that I think my client has here.

But at what point do we bring

this all to a halt?

to make that the last court to rule against me was wrong.

15

I mean, there's always one more argument

There are six

23

important opportunity for a judge to be able to look at an

18

MR. RASHKIND:

I will.

Are

With due deference to my

19

colleagues, it's 177 words long, over two pages.

20

that's why I thought that the approach that we brought to

21

the Court from the other nine circuits is a simpler -

22

what I would call a simple two-step.

23

And

Their approach actually can be read, as we did

24

in our reply brief, to fit within our own rule, but I

25

think the problem with the Government's rule is it is so

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

broad and it does not rely upon any of the Court's

2

precedents in -- in its writing.

3

you adopt a rule like that, first of all, is create

4

confusion.

6

-- the Court has previously done in its AEDPA

jurisprudence.

14

interpret as being unfavorable to my client, I think just

15

puts the kind of difficulty in the courts that this case

16

should try to avoid.

17

So my comment on it is that it may well, if it's

18

read as we did in our reply brief, be the same thing that

19

we're saying and what I refer to as a simple two-step

that -- that civil rules are applicable but have to be

modified to be compatible with habeas jurisdiction.

6

And here you

So -- and -- and given that the habeas rules say

MR. RASHKIND:

I think it's very important to

7

realize that both rule 81 of the Federal Rules of Civil

8

Procedure and rule 11 of the rules of habeas procedure,

9

which the State would have us use as a constraint, really

10

are the first things that tell us that there's supposed to

11

be a functional approach.

12

that the rules apply to the extent that they're

13

compatible, and so that's certainly not a categorical

approach.

15

Both of those rules tell us

That is a functional approach.

it rules out is new legal claims or new evidence.

It's a decision interpreting what the law was

there would be no statute of limitations.

If -- if that

in this Court on a 60(b) motion, which I would submit is

JUSTICE SOUTER:

If there had been an Artuz

13

violation and not every statute of limitations

14

determination implicates Artuz.

15

MR. KISE:

That's correct, Your Honor.

But at

16

the same time, there may be some other mistake or some

17

other excusable neglect or some other issue that comes up.

18

I mean, what Congress intended to prevent is not

19

just the successful filing of a 60(b) or the successful

20

revisiting, if you will, of the judgment.

21

intended to prevent the actual attempt itself.

22

once we've had this adjudication, you are not to come

1

principally concerned with -- Congress was concerned with

2

two things.

3

That's not what is before us.

4

with a 1-year statute of limitations.

5

on that point is that this guy did not get the benefit of

6

the statute of limitations that he had a right to get the

7

benefit of, that there was a flat mistake of law.

8

-- by recognizing his statute of limitations claim, we do

9

not open the door to second and successive litigation.

It was concerned with second and successive.
Congress was also concerned
What is before us

So by

We

10

open the door simply to Artuz problems on statute of

11

limitations rulings and that's a pretty narrow category it

12

seems to me.

13

MR. KISE:

But I would -- I would respectfully

14

disagree with Your Honor's premise that -- that he -- he's

15

not seeking to revisit an adjudicated petition.

16

he is seeking, as -- as we see it, to -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure.

Sure, he does.

He did -

And if

18

it's second and successive, he's going to get thrown out

19

again.

20

MR. KISE:

And we would submit that it is second

21

and successive because it's seeking to revisit that

22

adjudication, an adjudication that was had on a non

23

technical procedural basis.

take that discretion away from the district courts.

2244(b)(1) says you will not look at it again, and

5

2244(b)(3) says, in fact, that when you do go back to

MR. KISE:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe that's the problem.

Perhaps I You explain.

I -- I thought

4

when I first read this, that this was quite broad, but I

5

may not have read it perfectly.

6

MR. KISE:

Well, and I don't want to pretend to

7

speak for the United States because -- because that -

8

that might cause me to misspeak.

9

But to answer your question about why fraud is

10

different, I -- I have three bases for why fraud is

11

different and why we think that that exception is the

12

right exception.

13

One, this Court has said in the past that fraud

14

is different than other things.

15

cited in Calderon, this Court has said that tampering with

16

the administration of justice through fraud involves more

17

than an injury to a single litigant.

18

against the very institutions designed to safeguard the

19

public, institutions that cannot tolerate fraud.

20

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the Hazel case that's

It is a wrong

So is that also true if his own

witness has committed the fraud?
MR. KISE:

Well, I -- I would -- our fraud

23

exception that -- that we -- we are delineating here is

24

material, intentional conduct that subverts the process.

25

And it can't be just anyone, Your Honor.

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. KISE:

Yes.

It needs to be someone in a position

3

to subvert the process for -- for a purpose like the

4

Government or the court if you -- if -- a judge that's

5

been bribed in the unusual example of that, or -- or the

6

-- the subornation of perjury in the Hazel sense.

7

examples -- that would be fraud that I think is what this

8

Court was talking about in Hazel -

9

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

What about a claim

10

that a witness perjured himself, a witness for the

11

government, during trial?

12

MR. KISE:

Those

Well, a witness for -- a -- a claim

13

that a witness for the government perjured himself during

14

the trial would certainly implicate material, intentional

15

conduct designed to subvert the process.

16

advantages to using fraud is -- is that it is a familiar

17

bright line, workable standard for district courts.

18

with fraud, you have to plead a little bit more

19

particularly, and so you would avoid in some respects some

20

of the question marks that would come up -

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

And one of the

And

And all I'm saying is exactly

22

whatever criteria is met, that it happens to be his own

witness, and sometimes your own witnesses do have their

24

little games, you know, with prisoners, and so it's the

25

same thing.

to contain the potential for -- for abuse.

But returning again to Justice Breyer, because I

19

I mean, they never obtained the

near paramount under certain circumstances, must yield

23

that's why Florida maintains that this is the correct and

24

-- and only exception.

25

reasons that we maintain that this is the correct and only

And -- and so

And -- and there are several

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1
2

exception.
The first and -- and most important, and -- and

3

as I started this presentation, is that this is the only

4

exception that preserves congressional intent.

5

The second is -- is that AEDPA and rule 60(b)

6

cannot coexist except in very narrow circumstances because

7

they address the same subject matter in fundamentally

8

different ways.

9
10
11

And the third is, as I mentioned before, because
the court JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is it correct that they

12

address the same subject matter?

13

the integrity of the habeas proceeding, whereas AEDPA is

14

directed at the integrity of the original conviction?

15

MR. KISE:

Isn't 60(b) directed at

Well, I -- I would respectfully

16

disagree with Your Honor because 2244(b)(1) does deal with

17

the -- the revisiting of the Federal habeas petition.

18

2244(b)(1) specifically applies to the revisitation of the

19

Federal habeas petition.

20

deal with the same subject matter in different ways, as I

21

began, AEDPA's whole purpose is to provide one basket of

22

claims within 1 year so the State has to defend one time,

23

and 60(b) allows for the potential -- and -- and I would

24

submit to you more than just the potential if this Court

25

were to approve a standard -- for -- for repetitive

The

And in -- in terms of how they

Washington, DC 20005

1

claims, many baskets, many -- many years, and -- and many

2

times that the State has to come back.

3

And as I say, in this case the -- the principle

4

of finality is all but abolished in this case and all be

5

eviscerated simply by the fact that nearly 25 years later

6

Florida is still in this Court defending this judgment

7

that was based on a guilty plea, not even a -- a

8

conviction.

9

not as part of the holding, but -- but mentioned in -- in

And -- and as this Court recognized, albeit

10

Calderon with respect to the enduring respect for

11

finality, this is something that has survived both direct

12

and post-conviction review in the State court system.

13

I mean, this is -- this is Federal review of a

14

sovereign State's determination as to the application of

15

its criminal laws, and Congress has made a policy

16

determination that -- that that Federal review must be

17

limited because State -- State exercise of its -- of its

18

police power and -- and the enforcement of its judgments

19

is something that needs to be respected.

20

And Congress -- because the power to grant

21

habeas is given by written law, Congress has the power to

22

make that policy determination.

23

argues that 60(b) somehow strikes a balance, I would

24

submit to this Court that Congress has already struck that

25

balance.

And while the petitioner

Congress has already made that determination.

39
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

There isn't another balance to be struck by the use of

2

60(b), but that a balance has already been struck by

3

Congress and Congress has made a determination that in

4

most circumstances finality is going to trump.

5

And this isn't a perfect system.

There are

6

going to be exceptions with any bright line rule.

7

any bright line rule that this Court has ever carved

8

out -

MR. KISE:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. KISE:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

Didn't Congress rule -- rule

11
12

With

Yes, yes.

-- in -- in capital cases.
Yes.

I don't know -- under the statute?
Yes.

I may be wrong about

having -

19

MR. KISE:

I'm not certain.

We -- we're

20

submitting that the Congress under -- under AEDPA ruled

21

out 60(b) in all cases with the exception of -- of the

22

fraud.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought there was a special

24

provision for capital cases.

25

MR. KISE:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

But with respect to the bright line rule that -

2

that we submit is necessary to effectuate congressional

3

intent, as I was saying, that it's not a perfect system.

4

And the petitioner can come up with all manner of examples

5

that -- that seem to implicate various policy

6

determinations about what should or should not happen in a

7

given situation.

8

But -- but our position -- and we believe the

9

position of the Eleventh Circuit is -- is that Congress

10

has already weighed that now.

11

that determination.

12

the line is going to be drawn and it's going to be drawn

13

on the side of finality and it's going to be drawn on the

14

side of respect for State sovereignty.

15

Congress has already made

Congress has already told us where

And I would -- would also submit that -- that

16

the Sixth Circuit test and the functional equivalent

17

approach test that's advanced by the petitioner ignores

18

really both the statute and it ignores reality.

19

ignores the statute because AEDPA tells us you can't

20

revisit an adjudicated habeas petition unless there are

21

certain limited circumstances that are met.

22

ignores reality because the only reason to revisit a

23

habeas petition is to ultimately revisit the underlying

24

State court judgment.

25

there is to ultimately get at that State court conviction

It

that is -- that is under siege.

2

With respect to the coexistence, the petitioner

3

made a point about this case is somehow like the Rhines

4

case that was decided recently by this Court.

5

Rhines case, this Court was balancing the exhaustion

6

requirements with the statute of limitations provisions.

7

Here there's nothing to balance.

8

a prohibition.

9

these isolated, limited circumstances.

But in the

Here this is just simply

Congress says you cannot revisit except in
And so rule 81,

10

habeas rule 11, and this Court's decision in Pitchess all

11

say that 60(b) does not trump if the habeas statute holds

12

differently.

13

And finally, the courts do need a bright line

14

that's not subject to variance, as I mentioned earlier.

15

This is a workable standard.

16

It's well defined in the case law.

17

particularized pleading which makes less room for

18

mischief, and it -- it gives the courts an easily

19

identifiable standard by which they can effectuate that

20

congressional policy, that congressional policy of one

21

basket of claims within 1 year and the State will come

22

into this Federal court one time to defend its sovereign

23

judgment.

They're familiar with fraud.
It requires more

on the grounds that it was incorrectly decided is a second

gatekeeper.

If you are seeking to upset a final

3

If you are not seeking to upset a final

4

determination, let me give you the two -- the two

5

circumstances that come to mind right away.

6

One is the fraud exception recognized by the

7

court of appeals, and there could be similar errors like

8

that -- and this is what we talk about in our brief -- that

9

essentially vitiate the existence of a determination in

10

the first place.

11

rudimentary.

12

recognizes to be a determination and what Congress wanted

13

you to have.

14

They are that profound and that

Then you are not upsetting what our system

The other exception is essentially 60(a),

15

clerical -- you're not -- errors.

16

upsetting anything.

17

or effectuate the actual ruling by the court of appeals.

18

The only gap -- I'm not sure it's a gap at all

You're not really

You're actually trying to implement

19

after the argument here -- is that we don't limit it to

20

fraud.

21

foundational, rudimentary, fundamental errors that

22

conceivably could occur.

23

but something like a biased judge addressed by this Court

24

in Toomey v. Ohio.

25

We recognize that there are some other

8

follow 60(b), maybe not the evidentiary, maybe not the new

9

evidence part, follow it, but be sure you do so strictly.

10
11

Are you saying more than that?
MS. MILLETT:

I am saying a lot more than that,

12

and that is, first of all, because the vast majority of

13

things that are covered by 60(b) do not qualify as

14

tantamount to fraud or a biased judge.

15

And -- and the second incredibly important thing

16

is that Congress changed the decision-maker.

17

you have 645 individual district court judges applying the

historic equity power to -- to overturn final judgments.

errors of similar magnitude like a biased judge or some

other complete breakdown so that our system doesn't

recognize that to be a judgment -- it's not what Congress

thought it was giving you -- then that would be -- I can't

MS. MILLETT:

In -- in this case, the Artuz

problem is only an argument, and I -- we're not even

13

accepting that it's accurate, but only an argument that

14

the court made a mistake of law.

Why is the policy under 60(b) the same in

MS. MILLETT:

Justice Souter, there's two

answers to that.

13

will be hard to limit this to a statute of limitations

14

because the next argument is going to be procedural

15

default, and the next argument is going to be

16

misapplication of Teague's non-retroactivity principle,

17

and the next one is going to be mistake in applying

adequate, independent State grounds.

19

The first is that this won't be -- it

The -- a bulk -- a huge percentage of Federal

20

court decision-making in habeas cases is procedural rules

because Federal habeas is not a roving commission for

show it's proper for Federal courts to act.
