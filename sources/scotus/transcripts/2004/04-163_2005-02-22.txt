Attorney General Bennett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK J. BENNETT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9
10

MR. BENNETT:

Justice O'Connor, and may it

please the Court:
For 70 years the Federal courts have

11

deferentially reviewed both the efficacy and the wisdom of

12

legislation, even when it affects property interests.

13

This case squarely presents the question, should we now

14

turn back the clock?

15

We make two main arguments:

first, that the

16

substantially advance test should not be a standalone test

17

for determining whether regulation affects a taking

18

because such a test is fundamentally divorced from a major

19

principle of the regulatory takings doctrine itself,

20

economic injury; and second, if there is such a standalone

21

test, it ought to be no more searching than the rational

22

basis test of due process.

23

As this Court has stated in First English, the

24

Just Compensation Clause is not designed to interfere with

25

the ability of government to affect property interests,

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

but rather to require just compensation in the event of an

2

otherwise valid taking.

3

In this particular case, we had a circumstance

4

where one single Federal judge conducted a fact trial

5

where she evaluated the demeanor and credibility of one

6

expert from Chevron and one expert from the State of

7

Hawaii in order to make a determination of whether or not

8

garden variety economic regulation was constitutional or

9

unconstitutional.

There was no -- the test applied would

10

have been no different if this had been an act of Congress

11

instead of an act of the Hawaii State legislature.

12

this case, what the district court did was wholly

13

inconsistent, we submit, with any reasonable concepts of

14

federalism, and if it had been an act of Congress that

15

this district court judge was sitting in judgment of, it

16

would have been entirely inconsistent with the respect

17

that this Court has consistently said is due to a co-

18

equal branch of government.

19

In

A particular irony of the way the Ninth Circuit

20

applied what it believed to be the Agins test, which it

21

indicated the standard of review fell somewhere between

22

rational basis and rough proportionality, but the -- the

23

supreme irony of that, we suggest, is that if that test

24

were applied, it would have the effect of overruling the

25

very cases that Agins cited in supporting the language it

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- it used, that if indeed you have this type of

2

intermediate scrutiny, cases like Nectow and Euclid v.

3

Village of Ambler could not stand because, as this Court

4

has said, those cases set out a rational basis test,

5

whether the object was in the power of the legislature or

6

-- or the municipal authority and whether the means used

7

to achieve it were rational.

8

Circuit set up in this case, and as applied by the

9

district court, would have overruled those very cases

And the test the Ninth

10

because there would have been a fact trial necessary to

11

determine whether or not the -- the zoning ordinances at

12

issue in that -- in those cases were efficacious or

13

inefficacious.

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, does the fact that

15

discrete or individual property rights are being affected

16

and, indeed, taken justify some higher level of scrutiny

17

than we would apply to general economic regulation by the

18

State?

19

MR. BENNETT:

No, Your Honor.

We -- we would

20

think, first of all, this -- this Court has established

21

that it doesn't look at whether some stick in the bundle

22

of rights is affected by the regulation.

23

parcel as a whole.

24
25

It looks at the

And second, this Court has said that it is
shying away from per se tests, and indeed, it -- it looks

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

at these types of cases under the rubric of Penn Central

2

where the primary factor that the Court looks at is the

3

extent of the economic injury and also the extent to which

4

it interferes with reasonable investment-backed

5

expectations.

6

A particular irony of this case is that the

7

Ninth Circuit has said this particular statute of the

8

Hawaii legislature affects a taking without any regard to

9

whether or not it caused any economic injury to Chevron at

10

all.

11

legislation or the -- the major argument as to why

12

legislation should be deemed to be unconstitutional turns

13

on the legitimacy of the legislation, that finds a natural

14

home in the due process analysis, rather than in an

15

analysis that looks at whether or not the legislation

16

actually effects a taking or not.

This Court has found that when the major flaw in

17

Indeed, this Court, Your Honor, despite what it

18

said in Agins in relying on the due process analysis, has

19

never found a taking based upon doubt as to the likely

20

efficacy of economic legislation.

21
22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:
though, haven't we?

Well, we've said it a lot,

Why do we keep on saying it?

MR. BENNETT:

Well, Your Honor, I think that in

24

-- in Del Monte Dunes, every opinion in the case discussed

25

this language and -- and said that the Court has never

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

indicated that this sets out a more exacting test than

2

rational basis other than in the rough proportionality

3

context of Nollan and Dolan.

4

used in Agins, which came from due process cases, has

5

somewhat taken on a life of its own, and the lower courts

6

and the -- the supreme courts of the several States have

7

had quite -- have had a great deal of difficulty in -- in

8

dealing with what exactly the language means.

9

as we've set forth in our brief, that to the extent it

And I think the language

We believe,

10

establishes this intermediate scrutiny, as the Ninth

11

Circuit felt it did, that it would be dicta in Agins, but

12

if the Court viewed it as not dicta, we think that the

13

Court ought to reconsider the constitutional rule under

14

the standards for such reconsideration that the Court has

15

identified in cases like Payne v. Tennessee.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose -- suppose a person has

17

a piece of property, and they zone it suddenly, no

18

building -- no building -- which destroys the value of the

19

property pretty much.

20

those might be the cases where this language began to

21

appear, something like that.

22

rational basis review too?

23

case where it might be -- arguably you should have

24

something stronger since the property value is -- is

seriously hurt and --

MR. BENNETT:

Your Honor, if -- if the claim was

that the legislation was irrational, that it -JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

They're going to say,

4

well, we can imagine a reason, but if you look at it

5

realistically, you know there's no good reason.

6

MR. BENNETT:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

No -I mean, if you put your mind to

8

it, you can make one up, which is sort of the test for

9

rational basis in the economic context.

But as soon as we

10

become more realistic, there isn't much of a reason.

11

can't satisfy the stronger test, though it could satisfy

12

the weaker.

13

MR. BENNETT:

No, Your Honor.

It

We would suggest

14

that this Court's jurisprudence indicates that that type

15

of a claim of a taking ought to be analyzed under the Penn

16

Central test where you first do look at the extent of the

17

economic devaluation, if you will, of the property and you

18

look at whether there is an interference with reasonable

19

investment-backed expectations --

JUSTICE BREYER:

What are we supposed to do, to

return to Justice Scalia's question, with the fact that

22

this appears -- I counted about 12 cases, I mean, where it

implicitly or explicitly appears, something like it.

MR. BENNETT:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

We would

to be a standalone test, it ought to be part of due

Clause, it ought to find a home in the -- in the public

12

use portion of the Just Compensation Clause where if,

13

indeed, the economic impact in a regulatory takings

14

context is so severe that it constitutes a taking, then

15

whether it rationally advances a State goal ought to be --

16

ought to inform the question of whether or not it's a

17

public use, but that it shouldn't be a standalone test for

18

really sitting as a super-legislature to determine whether

19

or not this really advances the government's goals as

20

opposed to whether it could rationally have advanced

1

there's a public use than you would feel our doing it in

2

order to decide whether there's been a taking?

3

MR. BENNETT:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

Well -I mean, wouldn't all of your --

all of your objections apply equally?

6

MR. BENNETT:

Certainly if it were more than

7

rational basis.

8

oughtn't, wherever it's put, be more than a rational basis

9

test.

10

So we're -- we're suggesting that it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're -- you're not really

11

urging us to -- to defer the -- the evil day and simply

12

say, well, this test, which is more than rational basis,

13

may well apply to -- to whether there's been a -- a public

14

use or not, but it certainly doesn't apply to whether

15

there's been a taking.

16

MR. BENNETT:

17

No, absolutely not.

It shouldn't

-- it shouldn't --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

MR. BENNETT:

I hope you won't do that.

-- it shouldn't apply to -- to

20

either one, and wherever this -- if the Court wants to say

21

that this language needs to find a home somewhere and it

22

isn't in due process, then it shouldn't be more than a

23

rational basis test wherever it's put.

24
25

In many ways, Your Honor, this statute, Act 257
of the Hawaii legislature, is -- is almost identical,

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

although less intrusive, than the statute that this Court

2

upheld in Exxon v. Maryland.

3

both cases was the same.

4

in the retail market, and in Hawaii, where we have at the

5

refinery level a duopoly and at the wholesale level an

6

oligopoly, it certainly was rational for the legislature

7

to believe that trying to prevent the -- the oligopolist

8

from projecting their market share into the retail level

9

would have the effect of preserving competition.

The goal of the statute in

It was to preserve competition

And it

10

was certainly rational for the -- the legislature to

11

believe that limiting the rents that oil companies could

12

charge their independent service stations so that they

13

couldn't charge excessive or predatory rents would serve

14

the goal of preserving competition in the retail market in

15

a State where the oil -- where the gasoline prices at the

16

pump are the highest in the country and the -- the market

17

at the two levels above the retail level is

18

extraordinarily concentrated.

19

This Court, indeed, has said --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose it were clear,

21

from what the legislature said, that the only purpose of

22

this legislation was to help out some local dealers who

23

were politically powerful and the gasoline prices would go

24

up.

25

I assume you would be here defending the statute.
MR. BENNETT:

Well, Your Honor, what we would

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

say is that this Court's jurisprudence is that in applying

2

a rational basis test, one doesn't look at what the

3

legislature said was the purpose of the statute, but one

4

looks at what could be advanced as a purpose for the

5

statute and --

6
7
8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you would be here

defending the statute on -- in my hypothetical case.
MR. BENNETT:

Yes, Your Honor, and we would --

9

we would be, I imagine, positing additional reasons why

10

the statute would pass a rational basis test than those

11

actually reflected in the legislative history because I

12

think, as this Court has indicated a number of times, that

13

requiring the legislature to state reasons or, indeed,

14

looking at the precise reasons stated by the legislature

15

in deciding whether the statute furthers those goals as

16

opposed to other goals the legislature might have had,

17

simply sets this Court up as a -- as I said, a super-

18

legislature, and -- and really opens the door to the type

19

of intrusive review of legislative acts that this Court

20

has not engaged in for more than 70 years.

21

The number of cases that the Court has looked at

22

in which it has indicated that it is not going to get into

23

the business of determining efficacy or wisdom is, indeed,

24

legion, and really since the New State Ice era, the

25

Lochner era, this Court has not engaged in that type of

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

review.

2

stated that we do not believe in the soundness of the

3

views which uphold this law, and one can take that and

4

look at the Ninth Circuit opinion in this case in which

5

the Ninth Circuit does essentially the same thing.

And in fact, in Lochner itself, the -- the Court

6

decisions as to the wisdom of economic legislation are for

8

the political branches, not the courts.

21

Very well, General Bennett.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. KNEEDLER:

Justice O'Connor, and may it

please the Court:
The reasons why this Court has applied the

22

rational basis standard to review economic legislation of

23

the sort involved here go to the heart of the role of

24

courts in our democratic society.

25

courts, are elected to enact the laws, and courts,

Legislatures, not

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

therefore, do not substitute their judgment for the

2

economic wisdom of legislation for that of the

3

legislature.

4

ability and expertise of legislatures, especially to make

5

the sort of predictive judgments that the Ninth Circuit

6

relied upon in this case.

7

And courts typically lack the fact-finding

These fundamental principles about the role of

8

courts in our society would be greatly undermined if a

9

plaintiff could simply -- could obtain heightened scrutiny

10

of legislation by simply recasting his claim as a takings

11

claim.

12

notion doesn't find support in the Just Compensation

13

Clause.

And therefore, it's not surprising that this

14

When the government affirmatively exercises the

15

power of eminent domain to take property, the requirement

16

that compensation be paid doesn't rest on the proposition

17

that the legislation is ineffective.

18

taking presupposes that the -- that the action will --

19

will further a legitimate governmental purpose or at least

20

that the legislature could have rationally so concluded.

21

To the contrary, the

Any inquiry into the legitimacy of the

22

governmental purpose or whether it will be served,

23

instead, arises under the Public Use Clause, not whether

24

there is a taking.

25

or the legislature could not rationally so conclude, it is

And if those purposes are not served

Washington, DC 20005

1

not a public use and it's invalid and it should be

2

enjoined, the consequences not to trigger the payment of

3

-- of compensation.

4

And the -- the same analytical approach applies

5

for regulatory takings.

6

regulatory taking, this Court has developed tests to look

7

to see whether the nature of the government's restrictions

8

are essentially the functional equivalent of the exercise

9

of the power of eminent domain or appropriation.

In deciding whether there is a

And that

10

-- that the Court has done by looking principally at the

11

impact on the property owner, not the rationality of what

12

the legislature has done.

13

That has not been part of it.

For example, in the Lucas case, the -- the test

14

for finding a taking is whether all economic value has

15

been destroyed.

16

the Court has said that's such a fundamental interference

17

burden on the landowner that there is a per se taking.

18

And similarly under the Penn Central test, the central

19

inquiry is on the economic impact and the interference

20

with investment-backed expectations, things that look to

21

the impact on the -- on the landowner.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

along those lines in Penn Central, but in Agins, which

11

most people see as -- as the origin of it, the Court, as

12

was pointed out, relied upon Village of Euclid and upon

13

Nectow, both of which were due process cases and both of

14

which applied a rational basis test.

15

pages 24 and 25 of our brief, we set out the quotations

16

from Nectow and Euclid which show that the Court -- the

17

Court there was using the notion of whether the measure

I would point out that throughout the course of

history, the Court has sometimes used takings and due

5

example, the -- this Court's Rowan decision which refers

6

to the plaintiff's constitutional claim as saying that the

regulatory action violates the Fifth Amendment because it

8

constitutes a taking without due process of law.

9

sometimes the Court has used or parties have used those

And we -- we quote, for

I think

10

terms interchangeably, and that may well be what the Court

11

was doing in Agins.

12

And I think if you look at Penn Central where

13

that phraseology was -- was used, the same is true where

14

the Court was -- was relying upon the due process part of

15

Goldblatt, and the Court put the word taking in -- in

quotes, I think perhaps indicating that it was not looking

whether that doctrine includes the inquiries called for by

articulated in Agins, but which is grounded in principles

the Court has long recognized both before and after Agins.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it a regulatory taking in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How do I know that this is a

regulatory taking, in other words?

12

MR. STEWART:

It's a -- it's a regulatory taking

because the government has not physically appropriated the

14

property or condemned it.

15

regulation, it has taken the property interest from

Chevron.

Instead, by operation of its

It's like -JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but that -- that means if

it's a taking at all, it's got to be a regulatory taking.

19

But Justice Kennedy's question is what is the test for

20

determining whether it is a taking.

21

MR. STEWART:

And I believe that question, Your

22

Honor, is answered by Pennsylvania Coal where the Court

23

found that the fact that the statute at issue there

24

prevented Pennsylvania Coal from mining a certain amount

25

of the coal that was in the ground that it was otherwise

2

as assuredly as a condemnation of it would.

Court said, but the seemingly absolute protection of the

4

Just Compensation Clause in the context of a -- of a

5

regulation that affects that kind of appropriation, as

6

opposed to an outright condemnation of it, that that

7

protection is subject to an implied limitation that

8

exists to allow the government to serve its purposes, as

9

Pennsylvania Coal described it, if the government could

And then the

10

hardly function at all, if it were required to pay for

11

every interference with property rights occasioned by its

12

regulation.

13

Coal is a -- a rationale for allowing the government to

14

interfere with private property rights that would

15

otherwise be protected and otherwise could not be taken

16

without compensation in order that the government may

17

serve its legitimate purposes.

18

So what we have growing out of Pennsylvania

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then the question, of

19

course, is let's imagine you're either right or you're

whether their reason is quite a good one or just barely

2

good enough?

3

that the other side is putting to you, and I must say I'm

4

rather moved by their argument because it seems to me

5

whether it's a very good reason or just a barely adequate

6

reason has nothing to do with whether they should pay

7

compensation.

8
9

And that's -- that's the puzzle, I think,

MR. STEWART:

I think it goes to the difference,

Your Honor, between the public use standard and the --

10

which governs in a situation in which the government is

11

paying compensation.

12

discussing today, in that context, the Court has applied

13

a very deferential standard because the -- the burden on

14

property rights is lesser and the -- the impediment --

And in that standard, as we've been

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. STEWART:

-- to governmental action is

greater.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe I'm not -- I thought --

19

are we in the world in which you agree the government can

20

do it even though their reason -- or is your basic

21

argument, no, they can't do this at all?

22

it's not a compensation question.

23

whether the Constitution of the United States forbids them

24

from doing it.

It's a question of

it is a compensation issue.

It's a compensation issue.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So you want money?

5

You want a

I thought you wanted them to stop it.

MR. STEWART:

We wanted a declaration from the

6

court that the -- that they cannot proceed with a statute

7

that takes our rents without paying -- paying for us.

8

What's happened here is that this legislature has

9

enacted --

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but isn't -- I thought

11

your premise was that because the statute doesn't

12

authorize any payment, that is a way of stopping it.

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

The statute does not

authorize payment.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

So if -- if Hawaii modifies its

statute and says, we will give to you the difference

what our statute requires, you'd be perfectly happy.

look at how severely the State law burdens the property

rights.

Don't you?
MR. STEWART:

Your Honor, the -- in Lucas, this

Court found that a -- a complete deprivation of the

7

economic value of property constitutes a categorical

taking.

it mandates is to determine those circumstances in which a

deprivation that is less than a complete destruction of

economic value require compensation.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The point of the

my question because I haven't heard the answer.

in a world, imaginative if you like, where Hawaii passes

this statute, and what we're interested in is not whether

20

they can do it, but whether they have to pay compensation.

21

And my question is, what in heaven's name has the goodness

22

or badness of their reason to do with that question?

23

After all, I can imagine instances in which their reason

24

for the regulation is pretty bad.

the goodness or badness of the reason, once it has passed

the minimal point, has anything to do with whether you

9

should have to pay compensation.

10

MR. STEWART:

And my answer to that, Your Honor,

11

is that it goes -- it stems from the rationale expressed

12

in Pennsylvania Coal for allowing the government to

13

interfere with private property --

the regulation goes too far is whether there is a basis

for imposing the burden on a particular property right.

Here we have --

Holmes did not use the word legitimate.

your argument.

the -- growing out of Pennsylvania Coal, the Court has

have a barely adequate reason.

MR. STEWART:

Do you think that they

Your Honor, I -- to me there's a

15

threshold question of whether a general building

regulation of that type really would be a -- a regulation

17

that would implicate the Takings Clause at all.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it is an -- it does

there's a rational reason, but it isn't so you can do it,

hypothetical, why have the test at all?

test.

17

Penn Central is

Why do we bother

What's -- what's its value?
MR. STEWART:

I mean -- part of my answer to

18

that, Your Honor, is that this test, in our view, does

19

have very narrow application, which is the reason why we

20

don't believe that the State is correct in suggesting that

21

it will result in the invalidation of all kinds of

22

economic regulation.

23

Having said that, though, I do believe that it

24

is an important threshold requirement that should be met,

25

and if the government has not identified a basis for

the burden of a regulation and if it has not demonstrated

that the burden it is imposing is related in a -- in a --

imposed, then in that circumstance, the -- the rationale

for imposing that burden without compensation, in

contravention of the compensation requirement in the Fifth

Amendment, is missing.

of the sensible tendency of the test, to suggest that the

23

I'm not saying that should be the test for whether

relying upon there, Your Honor, is -- is the question

question.

MR. STEWART:

protections of the Bill of Rights.

circumstances in which the government may proceed.

14

would be a rational basis for it to proceed under a very

15

deferential standard that would be applied under the Due

MR. STEWART:

Your Honor, the State's position

2

in this case is that by preserving a network of lessee

3

dealers, there will be benefits to the public in terms of

4

lower gasoline prices.

5

is that those benefits would far outweigh the -- the

6

modest decrease in rent, lost rent to the oil companies.

7

And so that it -- it would make sense if the government

8

wished to make that choice and -- and to pay compensation,

9

if the government's theory were correct.

And I think their -- their theory

10

And one of the values of the Just Compensation

11

Clause and the constitutional rights that it protects is

12

that it forces that choice to be made.

13

decision on budget as opposed to off budget.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It -- it puts the

Well, why wouldn't it make

15

sense then for the government to say, Chevron, you charge

16

what you want and, station owner, we, the government,

17

gives you -- Hawaii gives you this money so you'll be able

18

to pay the excess rent?

MR. STEWART:

In fact, we believe that is -- is,

20

in essence, what is occurring here.

claim that the rents that Chevron or the other oil

22

companies were charging are excessive or that they have

6

then, but it should have to pay compensation just because

7

the benefits are not obvious, that they're bizarre, that

they don't -- may not really exist?

9

I'm having a problem?

10

MR. STEWART:

12

the Just Compensation Clause, would be that the government

13

should pay compensation in those circumstances where it is

14

depriving property owners of protected property rights.

But in Pennsylvania Coal, the Court said in the regulatory

circumstances to -- to interfere with rights without

the burden being imposed serves that need.

the Constitution, on the basis that its needs, its

legitimate interests require that intrusion, then the

court's role to enforce the constitutional protections is

to make that inquiry into whether the need is -- is being

actually served.

7

Now, I'd like to at -- at this point emphasize

8

that our position is not that no deference may be given to

legislative judgments under this test.

Our position is

10

simply that it must be more than a mere rational basis

12

Lochner-era cases, has held that mere rationality is

enough to satisfy the constitutional standard is that

there was no specific constitutional prohibition.

12

telecommunications companies could charge for access to

MR. STEWART:

them in those terms.

But I would like to, if I could, address the

broader point that I believe Your Honor was -- was making,

24

which is can these claims just simply be repackaged and --

and sweep into the takings analysis all of the regulation

and apply to it the very same test that the Court has

2

repudiated in Lochner.

3

is clearly no.

And the answer to that I believe

4

The -- the Just Compensation Clause is limited

5

to rights of private property, would not extend -- and I

6

don't believe there's anything in this Court's precedents

7

that would require it that it extend to the kinds of laws,

8

minimum wage laws, wage and hour provisions, regulations

9

on the size of bread loaves, that were the professional

10

licensing requirements that were the subject of the

11

Lochner-era cases.

12

And the Due Process Clause extends even to

13

expectancy interests or -- or reliance interests on

14

governmental benefit programs.

15

here would -- would apply to that because those, we don't

16

believe, have ever been held and -- and should not be held

17

to be covered within the specific provision of the Just

18

Compensation Clause.

19

Nothing in our position

Your Honors, in Nollan and Dolan and First

20

English, this Court recognized that the Just Compensation

21

Clause is not a poor relation among the provisions of the

22

Bill of Rights.

23

that the constitutional provisions by their very nature

24

limit the freedom and flexibility of the government in

25

order to protect constitutional rights.

In First English, the Court recognized

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

First English said that the Just Compensation Clause of

2

the Fifth Amendment is one such provision.

3

And our position here is that this

4

constitutional right, that private property shall not be

5

taken without just compensation, should be entitled to the

6

same protection as the other constitutional protections in

7

the Bill of Rights, and that just as with respect to those

8

rights, when the government seeks to intrude on those

9

interests, the court should properly inquire into the

10

nature of that intrusion and the justification for that

11

intrusion.

3

That type of a test belongs under the Due

This Court has time and time again said that it

is not going to set up separate per se tests except in

5

very limited circumstances and, indeed, it's not going to

divide parcels in the way Chevron suggests here and

7

whether it's in Tahoe-Sierra or Penn Central or Keystone,

8

the Court has said, absent taking all value or use of the

property or in Loretto, in the case of a physical

10

invasion, it is going to allow these types of regulatory

11

takings tests to be judged under Penn Central.

12

What Chevron is arguing for here is a separate

13

test outside of Penn Central, divorced from economic

14

impact, that concerns solely the legitimacy of the

15

regulation.

We suggest that that belongs in due process.
