ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC H. ZAGRANS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ZAGRANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, good morning,

and may it please the Court:

11

In Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, the Court

12

recognized an important limitation on the Court's prior

13

substantial Federal question cases.

14

should have followed Merrell Dow rather than ignoring it

15

in deciding whether the presence of a Federal issue in

16

this Michigan quiet title action properly gave rise to

17

Federal question jurisdiction.

18

The Sixth Circuit

According to Merrell Dow, any State law claim

19

that alleges a violation of a Federal statute as an

20

element of the State law cause of action does not state a

21

claim arising under Federal law for section 1331 purposes

22

unless -

23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Do you take the view that

24

Merrell Dow somehow just silently overruled about five

25

cases dealing with quiet title actions?

MR. ZAGRANS:
take that position.

3

We take Merrell Dow -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

4

position.

5

had that effect.

6

No, Justice O'Connor, we do not

That seems to be your

I mean, I don't think Merrell Dow necessarily

MR. ZAGRANS:

Agreed.

We believe that Merrell

7

Dow's decision can be synthesized with the holdings in

8

those cases that Your Honor is referring to by reference

9

to the nature of the Federal interest that is at stake and

10
11

the role that Congress plays.
In the Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust

12

Company line of cases and in Hopkins v. Walker, both of

13

those are different sorts of cases from Merrell Dow where

14

Congress provided the Federal right that was alleged to

15

have been violated, and the Court held that when Congress

16

provides a Federal statute that is -- is serving as an

17

element of a State law claim, then Congress must have

18

intended also to provide a Federal private right of action

19

in order for there to be arising-under jurisdiction.

20

That's the distinction.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Haven't we -- haven't we got

22

something equally different here?

23

as I understand it, is -- is not litigation of the State

24

law claim, but a claim under Federal law with respect to

25

the passage of title when property is taken for taxes.

The -- the issue here,

As

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

I understand the -- the original plaintiff's claim, it

2

simply is that if he's right, under Federal law he is

3

entitled to a declaration that the property is still his.

4

If he's wrong, the other side is entitled to property.

5

But the issue is a Federal issue, and the only way the

6

State has a role in it is that the State provides a

7

mechanism, the quiet title action, analogous maybe to

8

1983, for getting it into a State court.

9

me that the issue is a Federal issue, not as in Merrell

So it seems to

10

Dow, a -- a State cause of action that incorporates by

11

reference a Federal standard.

12

MR. ZAGRANS:

Justice Souter, I agree that it is

13

a Federal issue.

14

different from Merrell Dow because in both that case and

15

this quiet title action under Michigan law, the alleged

16

Federal issue is one element that needs to be alleged and

17

proved in order to make out the State law claim.

I disagree, with respect, that it's

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19

that's where we're parting company.

20

there is a State law claim as distinct from a State law

21

procedure for trying that claim in a State court.

22

as I said a second ago, it's sort of like 1983.

23

doesn't create causes of action, but it provides a -- a

24

jurisdictional basis for getting into court if you've got

25

a cause of action.

Yes, but I don't -- I guess
I don't see that

As I It

And in this case, it's a Federal

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

cause.

2

MR. ZAGRANS:

I see, Your Honor.

Under

3

Michigan's Compiled Laws and under the rule of procedure

4

that this action was brought under, the plaintiff had to

5

allege and prove four things:

6

alleged nature of the defendant's title.

7

describe the property with reasonable particularity, and

8

finally, he had to allege why his title was superior to

9

the defendant's title.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

MR. ZAGRANS:

that he had title, the
He had to

Which was a Federal issue.

And that is the only Federal

12

issue, just like in Merrell Dow where the Federal -- the

13

violation of the Federal labeling standard was alleged to

14

constitute one element of the product liability claim in

15

that case.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But as Justice Souter pointed

17

out, the State law incorporated the Federal standard and

18

made it its own.

19

very strong Federal interest, which was lacking in Merrell

20

Dow.

21

can be no doubt that the Government has a very strong

22

interest in seeing that tax sales convey a secure title.

23

Here you have the Federal tax sale and a

Justice Stevens said that.

MR. ZAGRANS:

But here I think there

No doubt, Justice Ginsburg, but I

24

think it is the wrong emphasis to look to what the State's

25

interest is, which was a -- a part of the focus that the

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Solicitor General's brief was on.

2

whether or not Congress intended there to be Federal

3

question jurisdiction, I don't believe the focus should be

4

on the State's interest.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. ZAGRANS:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

to interrupt you.

9
10

For purposes of deciding

Well, my --

Yes, sir.
Please, please.

I didn't mean

Did you finish your answer?

MR. ZAGRANS:

No, but go ahead, Justice Kennedy,

please.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Well, my -- my initial view of this case was

No, please.

13

much like Justice Souter's and -- and I still think that

14

that may be -- may be correct.

15

to Justice Souter would be that there are many cases in

16

which there is an antecedent Federal title which then goes

17

down through successive purchasers, mining claims, for

18

instance, and those are always under State law.

19

thought that would be your answer to Justice Souter and -

20

and also to Justice Ginsburg.

21

MR. ZAGRANS:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I thought your answer

Justice Kennedy And you rely on Merrell Dow,

23

which is fine.

24

cases that support you, as well as Merrell Dow.

25

I -- I

But I thought there was a separate line of

There are, Your Honor, but I think

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that to give a -- an honest and principled answer to

2

Justice Souter's and Justice Ginsburg's questions, I have

3

to face it in line of Merrell Dow and the cases that

4

Merrell Dow relied on.

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
answers will be principled.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. ZAGRANS:

9

We hope all your

Yes, sir, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

hope so too.

10

Justice -

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, Justice O'Connor had

12

asked you about the -- the quiet title cases, but Kansas

13

City Title & Trust is still good law.

14

overruled.

15
16
17

MR. ZAGRANS:

It wasn't

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree.

It is good law.
And I think the distinction that I am asking the

18

Court to draw between that case and Merrell Dow is this.

19

Both cases should be decided under the rubric that

20

arising-under jurisdiction depends upon whether a Federal

21

issue in an otherwise State law case provides a -- a -- an

22

outcome-determinative means of resolving the case, and

23

that -- in other words, where the resolution of the case

24

depends upon a substantial question of Federal law.

25

But the difference between Kansas City Title &

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Trust and Merrell Dow is the nature of the Federal

2

interest at stake and the different ways they should be

3

applied.

4

-- or the alleged violation was a Federal constitutional

5

violation.

6

In Kansas City Title & Trust, the interest was

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but the Court didn't

7

make it -- the Court's proposition in Kansas City Title &

8

Trust was if it appears from the complaint that the right

9

to relief depends on the construction or application of

10

the Constitution or laws of the United States.

11

asking us to take out or laws as dictum, or what is your

12

position?

13

MR. ZAGRANS:

So are you

I believe that the Court in

14

Merrell Dow made a limitation on that phrase that Your

15

Honor is quoting from, and the limitation is where

16

Congress controls the jurisdiction of the Federal courts,

17

such as with Federal statutory law, then the limitation of

18

Merrell Dow that Congress must also have intended to

19

create a Federal private right of action obtains.

20

believe that's -

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Well, when does -- when does

22

the -- when do the words, or laws, in Kansas City Title &

23

Trust have operative effect?

24
25

MR. ZAGRANS:

When -- when, as Merrell Dow says,

Congress intended there to be a Federal private right of

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

action for violation of the statute is alleged to be JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You mean that the -- are you

3

saying then in the context of this case that the Federal

4

law would have to create a quiet title action, which is

5

traditionally State law?

6
7
8
9
10
11

MR. ZAGRANS:

Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly

what we are arguing.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But doesn't Congress have to

create causes of action for constitutional violations as
well, or at least for most of them?
MR. ZAGRANS:

Your Honor, Congress has not

12

created a jurisdictional statute for Federal

13

constitutional claims, which is why the Bivens doctrine

14

arose, unlike section 1983.

15
16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, maybe this needs -- I

mean, if were to clarify -

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sorry.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm -- I'm not sure that I -

20

that I'm satisfied with the answer.

21

trying to give us one rule for constitutional claims and

22

another rule for statutory claims?

23

MR. ZAGRANS:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

understand it.

You're -- you're

I am, Your Honor.
On -- on what basis?

I don't

Certainly in the text of the

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdictional statute, there's no such distinction.

2

-- what is the basis for it?

3

MR. ZAGRANS:

What

It derives from footnote 12 of

4

Merrell Dow where the Court was attempting to explain this

5

-- this difference that we are discussing.

6

footnote 12 of Merrell Dow, the Court says that the nature

7

of the jurisdictional answer will frequently depend upon

8

the different nature of the Federal interest that is at

9

stake.

And in

And it distinguished between Smith and -- and

10

Moore in that case, Smith being a Federal constitutional

11

question, Moore being a Federal statutory question.

12
13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you think that that

explains all of these cases.

14

MR. ZAGRANS:

Well, Your Honor, yes, I do

15

because of the nature of Congress' control over whether or

16

not there should be Federal private rights of action.

17

is consistent with the Court's implied private right of

18

action jurisprudence from Alexander v. Sandoval, from the

19

Central National Bank of Denver case, et cetera.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It

But you can't get anything out

21

of the words of the -- of the statute arising under to

22

help you.

23

MR. ZAGRANS:

No, Justice Kennedy, I don't

24

believe you can because as many of the cases that this

25

Court has decided point out, those words are broad.

They

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

are the exact same language that the constitutional grant

2

of Article III jurisdiction uses, and therefore, they have

3

to be given content in some other fashion.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

Federal interest is the --

6

MR. ZAGRANS:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. ZAGRANS:

9

So just the strength of the

Clearly the --- the controlling test?

-- the strength of the Federal

interest is important, Justice Kennedy, but as Merrell Dow

10

pointed out, the Federal interest is not deemed to be

11

substantial enough, or the Federal question at stake in

12

the case is not deemed to be sufficiently substantial

13

unless Congress has created a Federal private right of

14

action for violation of the particular statute that is

15

being pled.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's what I -- I wanted to

17

follow up on this because I think it's a confusion that's

18

embedded in my mind in some of the cases, exactly what

19

Justice Scalia was asking you.

20

comment on whether the confusion, as I see it, that's

21

involved here is the words -- arises out of the words,

22

private right of action.

23

where, A, one private person sues B, a non-Federal person,

24

under a Federal statute.

25

confusion is because where you have a statute that governs

And I'd like you to

Private right of action is

And the reason that can lead to

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the relation between the Federal Government and a private

2

person, the words private right of action are out of place

3

normally, because an action between the two parties takes

4

place usually under the APA.

5

Now, that's what it seems to me is at work here

6

because the real question is not whether we have a private

7

right of action or APA review.

8

Congress wanted to allow a private person to use this

9

particular Federal provision as the basis for judicial

The question is whether

10

review in a lawsuit.

11

the answer here is obviously it did.

12

And if that's the right question,

It happens that we would have titled that

13

normally administrative procedural review under the APA.

14

But whether you call it private right of action or you

15

call it APA review is beside the point.

16

Congress did not want actions to come into a court under

17

the statute there at issue.

18

doesn't mind at all.

19

into court under this statute.

In Merrell Dow,

In this case, Congress

In fact, it expects actions to come

20

I'd like you to comment on that thought.

21

MR. ZAGRANS:

Justice Breyer, I disagree with

22

the premise of that thought.

23

provide what I would like to call a Federal private right

24

of action.

25

Government, not another private party, for damages in the

Congress in section 7433 did

It's an action by a private party against the

event the Government violates Federal law in the tax

2

collection process.

3

Solicitor General concedes it did not do -- is create a

4

Federal private right of action for quiet title claims in

5

disputes between two private parties.

6

What Congress did not do -- and the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How did Congress -- surely

7

Congress did not expect any pronouncement of -- of title

8

by the Federal Government to be immune from challenge by

9

private individuals.

If Congress did not anticipate that

10

a wrongful assertion of title through the Federal

11

Government could be challenged by a State action of this

12

sort to clear title, how did Congress expect it ever to be

13

challenged?

14

would attack somebody who -- who claims that he has

15

Federal title.

16

I mean, I can't imagine how else you -- you

MR. ZAGRANS:

You would bring, Your Honor, a

17

State quiet title action, as Grable did in Michigan court,

18

and allege, as the basis for the superiority of

19

plaintiff's title in that case, the violation of Federal

20

statute by the Federal agents.

21

purchaser at this Federal tax sale, Darue Engineering in

22

this case, does not have superior title.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And therefore, the

that differ from what happened here?

Honor.

11

the removal of that State law quiet title action to

12

Federal court under arising-under jurisdiction merely

13

because of the presence of a Federal issue as an element

14

of the State law claim.

15

What Congress, we are arguing, did not approve is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I think you -- you have

16

to acknowledge there are at least three situations then:

17

number one, where Congress did not create a Federal cause

18

of action and did not expect that the States would create

19

a cause of action to vindicate or challenge the asserted

20

Federal interest; number two, where Congress did create a

21

-- a Federal cause of action; and number three, falling

22

between the two where Congress did not create a Federal

23

cause of action but, in the nature of things, must have

24

anticipated that there would be State causes of action

25

resting upon the Federal claim.

MR. ZAGRANS:

Yes, I agree, Your Honor.

And in

Merrell Dow, the Court held that in those middle cases -

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. ZAGRANS:

Why was that a middle case?

Why was that a middle case?

5

Because in Merrell Dow, the State of Ohio had product

6

liability tort law -

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Congress would not have

8

necessarily anticipated that the States would glom onto a

9

Federal criterion for purposes of their State -- of their

10

State tort law -

11

MR. ZAGRANS:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But --- whereas here, Congress must

13

have anticipated that quiet title actions of this sort

14

would be brought.

15

MR. ZAGRANS:

Your Honor, when Congress enacted

16

the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and did not

17

provide a Federal cause of action for it and yet laid out

18

Federal standards of conduct for labeling of drugs like

19

Bendectin in that case, Congress must have understood that

20

without it creating a Federal private right of action, the

21

States -- the State product liability law, State

22

inadequate warning law would subsume claims -

4

State has the prerogative to ignore the effect of a

Federal tax sale.

the two cases:

Federal standards when it doesn't have to, and here,

there's no question that the Federal law governs the

11

to ignore it.

I don't think a

It's not an option for the State

Justice Ginsburg, that's an

13

argument that appears in the Solicitor General's brief as

14

well, and I believe that the Solicitor General's focus on

15

a difference in State interests is misplaced when one is

16

dealing with Federal jurisdictional principles.

17

I think the focus should be on the expression of the

18

Federal interest, and the best expression of the Federal

interest at stake is congressional intent when one is

dealing with acts of Congress, Federal statutory law.

To -- to try to -- to try to not have to

And that's not what we are

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- so you are -- you

10

are proposing one way to reconcile Kansas City.

11

well, that's the constitutional claim.

12

at least as good a reconciliation to say once you go

13

through -- there's -- there's a Federal claim -- there's a

Federal question that's dispositive of this case, and you

agree that that's so here.

Federal question is what determines this case, and you

satisfy the well-pleaded complaint standard.

19

You say,

The whole thing turns on the
So the

Then at that point, when you satisfy the basic

20

Kansas City Title & Trust provisions, then to see which

21

way to swing, why isn't it appropriate to say is this a

22

case where the State has a large interest and the Federal

23

interest is not significant?

24

a case where there is a large Federal interest in seeing

MR. ZAGRANS:

Because, Justice Ginsburg, I think

2

the focus is on the substantiality of the Federal question

3

and that's where the difference between the two situations

4

you are positing lies.

5

are almost always substantial Federal questions.

6

substantial enough to confer arising-under jurisdiction

City Title & Trust.

Yes, Your Honor.

1

we could leave the -- the Kansas City formulation, the

2

oral laws, intact and say that the distinguish -- that the

3

distinction between Merrell Dow and this case, which

4

leaves it intact is the distinction between in Merrell

5

Dow's case, the adoption by the State of a Federal

6

standard, though the State did not have to adopt it in its

7

tort law, purely optional, and in this case, the

8

application of Federal law which, under the Supremacy

9

Clause, the State had absolutely no choice but to apply.

10

If we recognize that distinction, we could leave the

11

language in Kansas City exactly where it is, couldn't we?

12

MR. ZAGRANS:

No, Justice Souter, I don't think

13

you could because I think to do that would federalize a

14

great many State law causes of action that just happen to

15

have, as an element of them, a violation of some Federal

16

law that, due to the Supremacy Clause, the States would,

17

of course, be obliged to enforce.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What -- what are the -- sort of

the -- the horribles that you have in mind?
MR. ZAGRANS:

An example would be anytime a tax

21

preparer makes a mistake of Federal income tax law in -

22

in preparing a return for a client and, as a result of

23

that, the client pays more tax than they otherwise should

24

have and they have a claim against the tax preparer either

25

for common law negligence or professional malpractice

Because of an interpretation of Federal tax

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yes, but in -- in that case,

5

the action is not enforcing the Federal tax law, whereas

6

in this case, the action is, indeed, enforcing the passage

It depends on whether the

Federal question has to be pleaded or not.

And the

14

justification for the well-pleaded complaint rule that the

Court has authored is that it provides a quick rule of

thumb for determining at the outset of the litigation

17

which cases are most likely to be ones where the Federal

law issues are at the forefront.

was part of the test that I announced.

9

in Merrell Dow is completely different than it was in this

First, this case falls within the Hopkins

10

case and in the Hopkins line of cases.

11

in Merrell Dow is that the State adopted a Federal

12

standard as presumptive evidence of State law negligence,

13

and when a State adopts a Federal standard into its own

14

State law standard, the -- the action remains one that is

15

fundamentally State law in character.

question in the case is not regarded as substantial.

What was going on

17

But here, the situation is entirely different.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

19
20

We do occasionally

review that kind of a decision here.
MR. GORNSTEIN:

You do, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

the Court in Merrell Dow drew a distinction between what

22

is substantial enough of a Federal question to trigger

arising-under jurisdiction as an original matter and what

24

is substantial enough of a Federal question to obtain this

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume that a fact in a

4

particular case which affects nobody else in the country,

5

but which is determinative of the Federal question is

6

never a substantial question of Federal law.

7

you -- you would not agree that -- that it's not only the

8

-- the content, but also the application of Federal law

9

that's -

10

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Is it?

So

Let me draw a distinction

11

between those cases where the cause of action is supplied

12

by Federal law, in which case factual issues are resolved

13

by Federal courts as long as there's a Federal cause of

14

action and cases where there's not a Federal cause of

15

action.

16

depend on a substantial question of Federal law.

17

the only issue in the case, in that kind of case, is a

18

factual dispute and everybody agrees on the law, then

19

there's no substantial Federal question, no removal

20

jurisdiction.

21

Federal law and the meaning of Federal law and there's

22

also a factual issue in the case, that would be removable.

23

Then you need -- the right to relief has to

But if the right to relief depends on

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

If there were only a

24

dispute about when the notice was given and not a factual

25

dispute, then it would not have been removable I take it.

MR. GORNSTEIN:

It's -- it's removable if the

2

only question was whether notice was given.

3

question is was sufficient notice given such as to

4

transfer title under Federal law, then that's removable.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But if the

Well, that's a very -

sliced baloney very thin.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that

9

slices the baloney the way this Court's cases have sliced

10

the baloney, and that -- the rule is that there has to be

11

a substantial question of Federal law.

12

the action depends on the meaning of Federal law, but not

13

one where everybody agrees on the meaning of Federal law

14

and all that's at issue is a dispute about the facts.

15

There is one when

Now, this case, as I said, does fall within the

16

Hopkins line of cases, and in each of those cases, the

17

Court held there was arising-under jurisdiction in a quiet

18

title action where the plaintiff's claim that it had

19

superior title to the land in question depended on the

20

meaning of Federal law.

21

The quiet title action provides the mechanism for review

22

of this question, but the question is entirely one of

23

Federal law as to who has the superior interest in the

24

land, the tax sale purchaser or the taxpayer.

25

And, of course, that's true here.

If the Court has no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC H. ZAGRANS

The test is a State cause of action that

law arises under for 1331 purposes.
The difference between my argument and the

12

argument of respondent is the meaning of substantial or

13

what constitutes substantiality.

14

Court held for all Federal statutory purposes the Federal

15

law is not substantial enough to confer arising-under

jurisdiction unless Congress created a private remedy

17

along with the statute.

And in Merrell Dow, the

Mr. Zagrans, there is

22

demands of reason and coherence, dictates of sound

Dow's emphasis on making pragmatic, sensitive judgments,

judgments that are both principled and common sense,

dictated the holding in that case which was when it's an

act of Congress that is being inserted as an element of a

State law claim, in order then to bootstrap that State law

claim into Federal court on removal jurisdiction, there
