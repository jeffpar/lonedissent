ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. CASEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

In this facial challenge to the Michigan

11

statute, court of appeals rulings that these lawyers have

12

third party standing and that their potential clients have

13

a constitutional right to appointed counsel in

14

discretionary appeals are both wrong.

15

First, with respect to the standing argument, in

16

our brief we argue that the respondent attorneys could not

17

meet any of the criteria for standing.

18

like to focus on the element of prudential standing that

19

considers whether there is a hindrance to the ability of a

20

third party to protect his own -- to protect his own

21

interest.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This morning I'd

-- there is an injury in

23

fact.

These lawyers claim that if the State were

24

compensating for this service and they're on the list to

25

be appointed, they would have more money in their pockets.

You're not -- you're not challenging that there is an

2

injury in fact.

MR. CASEY:

Yes.

In our -- in our brief we have

4

challenged that.

5

an injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or

6

imminent injury in fact.

7

The -- the requirement is that there be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- you said now you

8

were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked

9

were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and

10

you said no.

And -- and why not?

Because it seems so

11

obvious that they would get appointments if the system

12

were --

I -- I would like to rest on the brief.

17

But I -- in answer to your question, we believe

18

yes, there is a likelihood that these lawyers on the list

19

for appointed counsel will some day -- if they stay on the

20

list and a case comes up in that county, there is a

21

likelihood that there will be a case.

22

that on these facts in this facial challenge, we don't

23

know how many lawyers are on the list for appointments in

24

Saginaw County.

We don't know how many appeals of this

25

nature come up.

So it may be many years before the

situation arises.

This is not a concrete and

2

particularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and

3

we've argued that in the brief.

4

At -- at best, if there is an injury in fact and

5

if there is -- another factor is the close relationship to

6

the third party.

7

we've argued in our brief that they don't exist.

8

it is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning

9

the hindrance to the third party does not exist here.

10

We believe those are weak at best, and
I think

This is a facial challenge bought by -- brought

11

by lawyers before the statute took effect, claiming not

12

that the statute violates their own constitutional rights,

13

but that it violates the rights of potential future

14

clients, and that the lawyers will suffer economic harm.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

May I clarify something about

16

this case?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Didn't -- didn't the Michigan

Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the

8

statute was constitutional, that there was no right to

9

counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel,

10

paid counsel?

11

MR. CASEY:

That's correct.

In -- in 2000, the

12

-- the -- while this case was pending, the Michigan

13

Supreme Court issued an opinion, the Bulger decision

14

that's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice

15

of denying appointed counsel was constitutional.

16

statute was not in effect at that time.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the position you've

3

taken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should

4

take the case?

5

MR. CASEY:

What I said in the Halbert case is

6

that the Court need not grant this petition now because,

7

although it's an important question, the issue is pending

8

in -- in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v.

9

Tesmer.

If this Court rules in our favor on standing and

10

then does not reach the constitutional question, then it

11

would be appropriate to grant certiorari in either the

12

Halbert case or the Harris case because the -- the

13

determination of the constitutionality of this statute is

14

important to the State of Michigan.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do they have lawyers in those

cases?

MR. CASEY:

Now, the Halbert petition is pro se.

petitions.

prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential

standing, because I guess there's article III standing

2

now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore

3

that aspect of the case?

MR. CASEY:

As a matter of judicial economy,

5

there is a point to be made that it -- the issue has been

briefed and argued.

No, but in that case there was

the interests of the litigant or a potential client.

13

there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.

14

MR. CASEY:

That's true.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's true.

Of course, also bearing upon

view, the -- the most logical, most appropriate

very important question, whether the Michigan law can

opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by

tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means

Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in

Your Honor, the only kind of case to

which this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case

exactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the

underlying change in the law or the underlying law

disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because, first of all, if the

indigent or the client still has representation, then

there is no hindrance to the third party raising it

Suppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and -­

That's the claim that the -- that the client would

suits.

I can demonstrate that.

That's my specialty,

antitrust law.

11

wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection

13

I'm going to lose a lot of business.

MR. MORAN:

Why

trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to

standing is never predicated on the idea that third party

standing is appropriate only if it is impossible for some

3

MR. MORAN:

That may well be a wise course of

action -- action, Justice Ginsburg.

4

I should point out that Mr. Casey, when he filed

5

the response to the Bulger cert petition, brought this

6

Court's attention to the fact that this underlying

7

litigation was proceeding in a case that was then called

8

Tesmer v. Granholm.

9

attention that we had already prevailed in Federal

And so he brought to this Court's

10

district court in Tesmer v. Granholm as a suggestion as to

11

why this Court did not need to grant cert in the Bulger

12

case, and so this Court did not grant cert.

13

of course -- I don't know why this Court did not grant

14

cert in Bulger.

15
16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't know,

But he said now he's not

taking that position in the Halbert case.

17

MR. MORAN:

But I can be confident that if there

18

are any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of

19

jurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will

20

alert this Court of them.

21

example, in the Melody Harris case, the Michigan Supreme

22

MR. MORAN:

I'm willing to concede that because

18

it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an

19

impediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying

20

to get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal

21

district court -- for an indigent, a typical person who is

22

very likely -- someone like Mr. Carter, functionally

23

illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his

24

rights, to try and navigate the -- the procedural hurdles

25

of the Michigan system to get all the way through the

daunting hurdle.

has recognized time and time again in -- in plea cases,

4

Roe v. -- Roe v. Flores-Ortega.

5

time and time again in Peguero that even in a plea case a

6

typical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or

8

through multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for

the first tier.

And that's Evitts v. Lucey.

This Court has recognized

10

On the merits, I certainly would like to correct

11

Mr. Casey's representations about the -- the nature of the

12

Michigan system.

13

leave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in

14

the grounds presented.

15

look at each and every one of the cases that Mr. Casey has

16

cited for the proposition that that is not a determination

17

on the merits because not one of them says that.

18

of them specifically says that a order denying leave for

19

lack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision

Your Honor, Michigan requires that

12

then the indigent would have to recognize that by -- by

himself, and then raise that issue, the ineffective

15

So if counsel has not raised the issue,

Further, even if counsel has recognized it, what

a result of the order in Melody Harris, a typical Michigan
