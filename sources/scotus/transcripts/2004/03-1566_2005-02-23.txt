ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. SMILAND

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. SMILAND:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

10

The relevant language of the 1963 contract, as

11

illuminated in the surrounding circumstances, was

12

confirmed in the express terms of the 1986 stipulated

13

judgment which commanded the district and the United

14

States to perform the contract.

15

In particular, the first sentence of paragraph

16

4.2, which is at joint appendix page 111, states -- and I

17

quote -- the district acknowledges that it entered into

18

the 1963 contract for the benefit of Areas 1A and 1B.

19

That's the premerger -­

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Smiland, do you mind

21

telling us why the petitioners never filed suit in the

22

Court of Federal Claims?

23

MR. SMILAND:

Yes, Your Honor.

24

history of litigation here.

25

in 1979.

There's a long

It began with the first suit

We were in the district court there.

There were

Page 3

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

administrative and constitutional and equitable issues as

2

well, and we were able in that initial case to combine all

3

those forms of relief in the district court.

4

course, we got this judgment that I began to read from.

5

And from then on, we had four or five other cases all in

6

the district court.

7

And then, of

We do acknowledge that on the breach of

8

contract, there is concurrent jurisdiction under the

9

Tucker Act.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it concurrent?

I mean, the

11

-- the statute I'm reading, the one you brought is consent

12

is given to join the United States as a necessary party

13

defendant.

14

as a necessary party defendant?

Is that what happened here?

15

MR. SMILAND:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

They were joined

Well, we think so, Your Honor.
They were?

I -- I think that's

17

-- isn't that -- what rule of -- I thought there's a -- a

18

Rule of Federal Procedure.

19

what's the -­

20

MR. SMILAND:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23
24
25

I can't remember what -­

Rule 19(s)?
Yes.

Is that what they were

joined under?
MR. SMILAND:

That -- that procedure was not

invoked here.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

Well, all right.

Were

Page 4

Alderson Reporting Company

1

they -- there's technical phrase well known in the law to

2

be joined as a necessary party defendant.

3

normal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is

4

that what happened here?

5
6
7

MR. SMILAND:

No.

Given the

What happened -- what

happened -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, okay.

If it did not

8

happen, then how could you possibly sue in that court

9

rather than the Court of Claims where the statute says you

10
11
12
13

can sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?
MR. SMILAND:

Because the waiver of sovereign

immunity statute says in any suit.
JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't mean in any suit in

14

sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1?

15

mean any suit in the universe?

16

Any tort suit?

17

refers to sentence 1.

18

Does it

Any suit in the world?

I would have thought that sentence 2

MR. SMILAND:

Well, it -- it does and that case

19

was litigated against the United States by my clients and

20

-- and we won in the Peck case.

21

have ended the matter.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And we think that should

But don't -- how can we, if we

23

have -- if -- if I read this -- this as meaning

24

technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter,

25

how could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of

Claims, you're in the wrong court?
MR. SMILAND:

Any suit is also in the first

sentence, Your Honor.

12

MR. SMILAND:

Yes.

It says -­

And -- and -­
-- in any suit you can join the

The -- the -- in the sue and be

sued cases, this Court construes that very broadly, and
this is the same root word and -­
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but we don't give broad

construction to waivers of sovereign immunity.

13

MR. SMILAND:

I -­

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Quite the reverse.

And it

15

says to join the U.S. as a necessary party defendant in a

16

suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the

17

contractual rights of a contracting entity in the United

18

States regarding any contract executed pursuant.

19
20

Now, I guess the farmers were not technically
the contracting entity.

MR. SMILAND:

They were not the signing -­

So you've got more problems.

Our -- our argument -- and again,

this has been resolved in the lower courts against the

Government.

3

the intended beneficiary doctrine, the duty is owed to the

4

third party, as well as to the promisee, and it's

5

enforceable by the third party, as well as the promisee.

6

But our -- our view is that by the nature of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you -- if the lower courts

7

were of this view, why did the district court in this case

8

give you three opportunities to have your contract claim

9

transferred to the Claims Court?

10

MR. SMILAND:

Once the determination was made

11

that we were not intended third party beneficiaries, that

12

was the law of the case, and had it been transferred to

13

the Claims Court, we -- we would have been bound by that

14

determination.

15

resolution the -- the intended beneficiary issue before we

16

could proceed in the Claims Court either.

17

We felt we had to bring to a final

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it does suggest that the

18

district court had at least some concern whether the case

19

-- your claim had been lodged in the right court.

20

MR. SMILAND:

Yes, although again that -- that

21

court had been hearing these matters for many years in -­

22

in numerous cases without this issue ever having come up.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but it's a -- see, I want

24

to know what I'm supposed to do.

25

you're out.

As I read the language,

As I understand the purpose of the statute,

Page 7

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make

2

sense to me if you're in.

3

court precedent to the contrary, which I'd certainly read,

4

but is there any Supreme Court precedent to the contrary

5

that supports you?

6
7

MR. SMILAND:

And maybe there's some lower

Just the -- the language of in any

suit definitely is -­

8

limiting part.

10

certain kind.

No, no.

The limiting part is in any suit of a

MR. SMILAND:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
What they give consent to is

13

joinder as a necessary party.

14

happened here.

15
16

But that isn't the

MR. SMILAND:

And that is not what

Only the -- the general principle

that language should be read in its ordinary meaning -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's ordinary meaning, you're

18

out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary

19

party is you weren't joined as a -­

20

MR. SMILAND:

There -- there at least is no

21

evidence that Congress had rule 19 in mind when it enacted

22

either the '52 statute or the '82 statute that we -- we

23

stand on.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's something that I

hadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that,

Page 8

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

well, if you're transferred to the Court -- to the Court

2

of Claims, that you bring with you all of the previous

3

rulings of the United States district court in California

4

and that those are somehow binding because of the law of

5

the case -- what is the authority for that?

6

court that's transferred has to accept all the rulings

7

that have been made previous to the transfer?

8
9

MR. SMILAND:

12

I -- our understanding is if,

obviously -­

10
11

The -- the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, what's the authority

for that?
MR. SMILAND:

I can't cite you authority, Your

13

Honor, but I -- we were very concerned about that.

14

there was no waiver of sovereign immunity in the first

15

instance, then the lower court's ruling on intended third

16

party beneficiary I would think should be vacated.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If

Could I -- I -- I guess I'm not

18

following this.

19

have not referred to the last sentence of -- of what you

20

assert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says

21

any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any

22

United States district court in the State in which the

23

land involved is situated.

25

I don't know why, Mr. Smiland, you -- you

talking about in any suit -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

How does that help you?

Because it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of

4

course, this section starts off by talking about addition

of a person as a necessary party.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. SMILAND:

9

So how does the last

I -- I --

Well, it -- it -- if the words,

join necessary, limit any suit and the language that

10

Justice Scalia referred to, then -- then maybe we're in

11

trouble.

12

But otherwise -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I take that to mean that

13

when you sue one defendant and you also sue the United

14

States as a necessary party defendant, that suit -- any -­

15

that would be a suit pursuant to this section.

16

don't know what other meaning that -- that sentence could

17

have.

18

States, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party

19

defendant, that suit is a suit pursuant this section and

20

it can be brought in any United States district court in

21

the State in which the land involved is situated.

22

don't know what -- what other suit that -- that sentence

23

could refer to.

I -- I

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I guess we have to figure

out what is the right meaning of that initial phrase.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Perhaps you can explain.

5

This was not your suit originally.

6

Right?

This was started out by the water district.

MR. SMILAND:

The district sued the United

We intervened.

And then after some, I think,

It has settled its case.

17

It's a mystery what it

At least, I didn't see it in any of the

Why did the water district, having brought this

MR. SMILAND:

The record is very sparse, Your

18

Honor.

There is the district's motion which says pretty

19

much what it said in its brief, that there was a -- a

20

thing called the principles between it and the United

21

States and various parties.

22

principles, which are not in the record, although they are

23

a matter of public record, the -- the district in its

24

discretion elected to dismiss the case.

25

We would have hoped the district would have kept going.

And as a result of those

We opposed that.

1

We lost that opposition.

2

we were allowed to proceed on our own.

3

The district was dismissed, and

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Smiland, can I ask this

4

question?

If Justice Breyer is -- the thrust of his

5

question is right, I -- I think the district itself could

6

not have brought the suit under his reading of the

7

sovereign immunity.

8

United States ever taken the position that the district

9

could not have initiated this litigation?

And I'm just wondering, has the

10

MR. SMILAND:

Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could -- could we hear your

12

argument on -- on the sovereign immunity point as opposed

13

to the venue point?

14

United States has waived its -- its immunity from suit in

15

this case?

What -- on what ground do you say the

16

MR. SMILAND:

There are two statutes.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May -- may we just back up to

18

the question -- your answer to Justice Stevens?

19

that this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water

20

district for money damages.

21

declaratory relief against the United States.

22

MR. SMILAND:

I thought

I thought they were seeking

They pled both, Your Honor.

23

Although at that time the water still was available for

24

delivery, it hadn't flowed to the ocean.

25

had not yet been collected and spent.

And the money

So the focus

Alderson Reporting Company

2

initially was on equitable relief to stop -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because one could -- one

3

could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm,

4

validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for

5

declaratory relief but not encompassing damages.

6

MR. SMILAND:

Both statutes we cite say that

7

judgments can be entered in the same manner, to the same

8

extent as a private individual under like circumstances,

9

language I believe from the Federal Tort Claims Act.

10

Again, both in the 491 F.Supp. decision under the McCarran

11

Act and in the Peck case, the district court held that

12

money damages were encompassed by that.

13

-- statutes on which we rely have language in it taken

14

from other sources of law, with which this Court is very

15

familiar and has opined on several times.

16

So both statute

The -- the only unique parts of -- of either of

17

the two statutes that we stand on are -- are the rights.

18

One refers to administering a previously adjudicated right

19

to the use of water, and the other is the contract

20

language we've discussed.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

immunity now?

23

MR. SMILAND:

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Can you turn to sovereign

it easy for you.

Yes.
And -- and let me make -- make

Do you know of any case, other than

Page 13

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

cases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a

2

suit has been allowed against the United States based on

3

nothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary

4

of a contract to which the United States has -- on which

5

the United States has agreed to be sued?

6

any such case?

7

MR. SMILAND:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9
10
11

Is -- is there

No.
And -- and you think it's clear

that -- as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such
a third party beneficiary can sue the United States?
MR. SMILAND:

For example, in the U.S. v.

12

District Court case decided by this Court in 1971, under

13

the McCarran Act, that fact situation was not before you,

14

but the Court did say that the rights to which the statute

15

referred were all inclusive.

16
17
18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It read it broadly.

I -- I don't understand that.

The rights were all inclusive.
As -- as I understand the law of third party

19

beneficiaries, it -- it used to be -- and -- and perhaps

20

at the time this statute was enacted still was -- quite -­

21

quite restrictive.

22

agree with the Government's argument that -- that you have

23

to, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third

24

party beneficiary's rights.

25

is at issue, it's -- it's a different question, it seems

It's only in more recent -- I don't

But when sovereign immunity

to me.

2

MR. SMILAND:

Well, we have explicit rights here

3

and -- and it would seem to me that if -- if -- and this

4

was certainly the legislative history behind section 221,

5

not -- not behind McCarran.

6

owed by the promisor to the third party that it owes to

7

the promisee, and if the third party has the same rights

8

of enforcement as it does under 304 of the Restatement

9

that the promisee would have, why should it be any

10

different?

11

that?

But if -- if the same duty is

Why would Congress have intended to exclude

And it used the word contract.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Because -- because we have a

13

rule that says when Congress wants the United States to be

14

sued, it -- it must say so clearly.

15

MR. SMILAND:

You also have the rule that the

16

word contract means the law of contract and not parts of

17

it.

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But yes, isn't it arguable,

19

though, that in this case the Government probably thought

20

that it would be efficient to have the district represent

21

all the farmers for whatever their -- to the extent their

22

interests were shared with one another, rather than having

23

every individual have the same right to bring -- bring a

24

lawsuit?

25

MR. SMILAND:

Efficient in -- in collecting land

assessments and water charges, but there's no evidence in

2

the -- either the language of the statute, I submit, or

3

the -­

JUSTICE STEVENS:

district is the party to the contract, though.

6

MR. SMILAND:

Nothing was said about litigation,

9

Except for the fact that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but the -- the whole

point of the district -- correct if I'm wrong.

This is

10

your area.

11

easier for the United States to know with whom it was

12

dealing to have an efficient system, and if you say, well,

13

that doesn't include lawsuits for damages, it seems to me

14

that destroys much of the purpose of the formation of the

15

district.

16

The whole point of the district was to make it

MR. SMILAND:

There's a lot of legislative

17

history there, and it talks a great deal, as you say, Your

18

Honor, about efficiency and -- and the convenience.

19

it's not talking at all about litigation, about remedies,

20

about rights once there's a breach.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But

But you haven't really achieved

22

very much efficiency if you simply get the United States

23

out of the business of collecting the payments and of

24

keeping track of the payments but leave the United States

25

subject to suit when the person who has authority to do -­

the United States saved itself?

3

ride herd over -- over the person with -- with whom it's

4

dealing.

5

MR. SMILAND:

I mean, what -- what trouble has
It would still have to

Well, it -- this is a transaction

6

between a water seller and many water buyers.

Yes, in

7

1926 districts were put in the middle, but it's also true

8

in 1939 in -- in the section 9(e), Congress authorized the

9

particular type of contracts we have here, so-called water

10

service contracts, and it doesn't mention district.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Minear, do you think it

8

does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the

9

district?

10

And

MR. MINEAR:

In one circumstance, Your Honor.

11

This suit allows a district that has been sued by

12

individual water users to join the United States in the

13

ongoing suit and, in fact, remove the case to Federal

14

court if necessary, so there can be a determination of all

15

the rights in those -­

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Did this suit begin as a suit

17

by a water user against the district and then you were

18

joined later?

19

Is that --

MR. MINEAR:

No, it did not, but that did occur

20

in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation that ran between

21

1978 and 1980.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, in this suit, did not

That's correct.

That suit was brought under the

what I'm asking you.

MR. MINEAR:

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

8

MR. MINEAR:

9

But was it properly brought is

That suit was properly brought.
Okay.

But it was not brought under 390uu.

Instead, there was an allegation that the United States

10

had acted unlawfully and the Westlands relied on the

11

Administrative Procedure Act.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. MINEAR:

And no money damages.

And no money damages as well, and

14

that's what distinguishes this case.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that -- so your view -- I

16

mean, what -- what makes sense to me is that the section

17

means what it says, that consent is given to join the

18

United States.

19

And it makes sense because what the United States wants is

20

anyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court

21

of Claims.

22

between two other people, we'll make an exception because

23

there it's already in another district and we'll let you

24

bring the United States in as a necessary party.

25

other exception is when you don't sue for money damages.

That means join them in an ongoing suit.

But of course, where you have an ongoing suit

So the importance is that we get the

ongoing suit.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- that is to say, there's

3

a suit between only two individuals and then the United

4

States is brought in.

5

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, this -- this provision

6

was enacted in response to a specific problem that's

7

illustrated by the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation.

8

Individual farmers sued an irrigation district.

9

irrigation district was concerned that it might be subject

The

10

to inconsistent liability to the farmers on the one hand

11

and the Federal Government on the other, and it sought to

12

join the United States.

13

for that type of suit.

14

There was no mechanism in 1978
Congress acted -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that.

That's one

15

situation that this provision could cover, but there are

16

other situations that this provision could -- could cover.

17

Let's say a farmer wants to bring suit against the

18

district, but it doesn't really know whether the fault is

19

with the district or whether the district was -- was

20

compelled to do what it did by the United States.

21

sues the district and just in case the United States was

22

-- was responsible, it joins the United States.

23

doesn't the language entirely permit that kind of a suit?

24
25

MR. MINEAR:

So it

Why

The language could be construed to

allow that, but -- but waivers of sovereign immunity are

construed narrowly, and the language I think is more

2

properly construed, as Justice Breyer has suggested, to

3

allow joinder as a necessary party.

4

enacted in specific reaction to that problem in the

5

Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation where we did have ongoing

6

litigation and there was a sense by the irrigation

7

district they needed to join the United States so they

8

would not be subject to inconsistent suits.

9

And in fact, it was

So although I think that the language can bear

10

the -- the interpretation that you're suggesting, Justice

11

Scalia, nevertheless, I think the better interpretation is

12

the more narrow one that is -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Then -- then how do you explain

14

the last -- the last sentence of that provision, which is

15

any suit pursuant to this section?

In any event, I have to say that with regard to

The fact is that this

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Minear, when you say -­

15

when you say not money damages, do you read the words that

16

I read to Mr. Smiland restrictively or do you think they

17

accommodate money damages, that is, suit to adjudicate,

18

confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a

19

contracting entity?

20

MR. MINEAR:

We think that under your cases,

21

such as Pena v. Lane, there needs to be a specific

22

reference to money damages.

23

declaratory relief, and so we do not believe it would

24

allow an award of money damages.

25

go to the Claims Court if they're seeking money damages.

This simply is referencing

Rather, the party must

there is somewhat broader.

It does, as mentioned before,

adjudicate the rights under the contract, that doesn't

10

MR. MINEAR:

When it says

No, I do not think in this context

11

it would.

I think there needs to be something more

12

specific.

We're really talking about declaring rights

13

here and not providing a specific remedy.

14

has always taken the view that the Claims Court

15

jurisdiction is the appropriate forum for deciding money

16

damages.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And this Court

What about the second sentence?

The United States, when a party, shall be deemed to have

manner and to the same extent?

judgments, orders, and decrees of the court to the same

MR. MINEAR:

refers back to the previous sentence, which refers to

interpret that to include money damages, then the second

sentence would follow, but I -- I think the two have to be

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but if contractual rights

include a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you

14

get a money judgment in a case like that?

sentence certainly covers the possibility of a contractual

16

right to be paid something.

17
18

MR. MINEAR:

That first

Your Honor, again, waivers of

sovereign immunity are construed narrowly.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. MINEAR:

Now, let's -­

That's pretty clear language.

conceivably be -- be interpreted in -- on -- that broadly.

MR. MINEAR:

That might well be, but this is -­

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And -- and the next sentence,

4

as Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall

5

be treated just like a private party.

6

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

But Your Honor, ultimately I

7

think that we have to focus on that this is a waiver of

8

sovereign immunity.

9

on the question of whether these parties -­

10

And -- and so far we have not touched

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I think you've got a

11

very strong argument when you talk about an incidental

12

third party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but

13

now you're asking for a much broader holding than really

14

necessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me.

15

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, I think I started with

16

that point, that an incidental beneficiary cannot invoke

17

this -- this provision.

18

with that point because the party here is merely an

19

incidental beneficiary and not an intended beneficiary.

20

Under any of the -- the tests that have been applied for

21

third party beneficiaries, the party here would not

22

qualify as an intended beneficiary.

23

And I'd like to -- to continue

Most importantly, the contracting parties here,

24

the United States and Westlands, expressed no intent to

25

give this party enforcement rights.

The contract is quite clear that performance

This is a contract in which the

Separate from -- where does

that -- that obligation come from?
MR. MINEAR:

That arises from the regulations

provides for the delivery of water from Westlands to the

individual farmers.

MR. MINEAR:

That is -- and

17

Westlands has the -- has the option of either engaging in

contracts with the individual farmers or distributing the

19

water through regulation, and it has opted for

that agreement and that accord that had been reached.

2

Finally, I'd like to make a brief -­

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Can the district get damages

from the Government?

5

MR. MINEAR:

Technically yes, but their damages

6

are limited by the terms of the contract.

Westlands could

7

sue the United States in Claims Court for a breach of the

8

contract, but the contract itself says that any damages

9

that are -- that the sole liability of the United States

10

in these circumstances would be an adjustment of the

11

account.

In other words, there are not consequential

12

damages.

Rather, if we do not provide Westlands with the

13

water that Westlands believes it's entitled to, then we

14

stand liable for an adjustment in the payments that

15

Westlands would make to us.

16

The suit that is being brought here is asking

17

for consequential damages, and we believe that the

18

contract here does not allow consequential damages.

19

of course, is a merits question that there's no need for

20

the Court to reach, but that is the way it would be

21

resolved in Claims Court in -- in our view.

22

That,

I'd like to also raise the question of property

23

rights since that has -- has come up, that one of the

24

arguments that has been made by Westlands is that they're

25

entitled to status of a third party beneficiary because

Page 31

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

they claim they have water rights in these circumstances.

2

The fact is that the United States, the State of

3

California, and Westlands, as well as the California Water

4

Resources Board and the first tier of California courts,

5

have all concluded they do not have the -- the water

6

rights that they claim.

7

that that issue is irrelevant to the inquiry here.

8
9

But in any event, our view is

Rather, the question of third party beneficiary
status turns on the intent of the contracting parties.

10

Did they or did they not intend to give enforceable rights

11

to the third party?

12

that that was an intent -- there was an intent to create

13

enforceable rights in that third party.

14

Here there's not a shred of evidence

Quite to the contrary.

The only reference of

15

third parties, the farmers, in the contract here is

16

directed to limitations on what the district can do once

17

it receives its water.

18

-- the individual farmers.

19

it does it restricts the ability of the district in order

20

to protect the United States' interests, to make sure the

21

United States will be paid for the water that it

22

ultimately provides to the district.

23

It doesn't create rights in them
Quite to the contrary.

What

The central point that I would like to leave you

24

with, though, here at the end is the importance of

25

protecting the relationship between the United States and

Page 32

1111 14th Street, N.W., Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Westlands.

2

are able to reach accommodation and agreement, and when

3

we're able to do that, it's to the good of all concerned.

4

The contracts and the laws here are structured to allow

5

those types of agreements to be reached, and we think that

6

allowing third party beneficiary suits would be very

7

disruptive of that -- that operation.

of the district why this must be so.

20

I want to make two points from the perspective

First, allowing a direct right of action by

21

petitioners is not practical or consistent with the

22

district's need and ability to function as a governmental

23

entity and to allocate all of the water that it receives

24

under contract to all of the landowners within the -- the

25

district.

This is a scarce and valuable resource, and

these types of third party lawsuits jeopardize the

2

district's ability to be able to provide water pursuant to

3

California Water Code provisions to all of the landowners

within the district.

14

anything other than the district avoiding litigation.

15

You know, and unfortunately, the -- the history

The -- the whole concept of a water district is

16

not to individualize or incrementalize the water and

17

interests in water in any one group of landowners or any

18

one landowner.

19

landowners to all of the water under the contract are to

20

be treated as a whole and allow the district to provide

21

protection to all of the landowners within the district as

22

a whole, the point there being that the water doesn't

23

belong to any one landowner or a group of landowners.

but rather broad rights of water throughout the district.

5

To allow a small group of landowners to decide how to

administer the contract, how to enforce the contract in

to all of the landowners solely in the hands of an

Now, at that point in time certainly, these

petitioners had the normal and ordinary rights that any -­

That includes, for example, writ proceedings, to argue

that the decision of the board was arbitrary, capricious,

otherwise unlawful, and that it should -- should be

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. SMILAND

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4

MR. SMILAND:

5

What happened here is that the United States

6

sold half the water it was obligated to sell under the

7

contract.

8

on the other half.

9

I'm sure you understand.

10

Thank you, Your Honor.

It doubled the price it was permitted to charge
It was a massive harm to the farmers.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, you say under the

11

contract.

12

that said that the United States will not be responsible

13

for under-deliveries, and I think it listed the drought

14

and the last thing was any other cause.

15

I thought there was a provision in the contract

MR. SMILAND:

Well, that's what we were about to

16

go to trial on, Your Honor.

That's a merits issue.

The

17

Ninth Circuit has abstained on whether there was a

18

mandatory statutory duty to cut off this water, and I urge

19

the Court not to -- to dive into that pool.

20

We're trying to get in the courthouse doors.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you were saying there's

22

-- there's a right under this contract to recover from the

23

United States for an under-delivery.

24
25

MR. SMILAND:

We have massive cross summary

judgment motions on that issue and we were entitled to go

11

that you are promising?

12

MR. SMILAND:

I -- I don't make much of it.

The

13

parties here and -- and the parties in the West fully

14

understood for 20 years, after Allen Orchards, that the

15

farmers were intended third party beneficiaries.

16

17

parade of horribles just has not come to pass.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's

Is -- is it correct, as Justice

19

Scalia suggested earlier, that so far as State litigation

20

is concerned, it would be limited simply to arbitrary,

unreasonable behavior?

That's true.

not to -- not to -- for an agency, of which you're -­

insist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can

contracts.

in front of the -- in front of the district court, and -­
