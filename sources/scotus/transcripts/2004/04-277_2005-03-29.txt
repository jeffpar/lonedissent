ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-281

11

MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress

12

declared that it is the policy of the United States to

13

preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that

14

presently exists for the Internet unfettered by federal or

15

state regulation.

16

directive in the order under review by concluding that

17

cable modem service should be classified as an information

18

service and not a telecommunications service under the

19

Communications Act.

20

be upheld, because it is consistent with the text,

21

history, and purposes of the Act.

The FCC implemented that clear policy

That reasonable determination should

22

The Act defines "telecommunications" as the

23

transmission of information without change in form or

24

substance, and "telecommunications service" as the

25

offering of telecommunications directly to the public for
4

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a fee.

2

Given that focus on the nature of the "offering

3

to the public," the FCC reasonably concluded that the

4

integrated cable modem service offering should be viewed

5

as a whole in determining its classification under the

6

Act.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

Why is that reasonable?

8

I mean, why is it offered to the public if it's offered

9

alone, but it's not offered to the public if it's offered

10

with a tie-in?

11

know, I'm selling you a windshield alone, I guess I'm

12

offering a windshield.

13

to buy the windshield with a car, am I any less selling

14

you a windshield?

15

I mean, if -- you know, if I say, you

MR. HUNGAR:

But if I say, you know, you've got

Well, I don't think we would say,

16

in that example, that you are offering windshields, per

17

se.

18

for sale over the Internet, but I don't think we would

19

ordinarily say that they are offering windshields or

20

steering wheels or tires for sale.

21

been necessary construction of a regulatory regime that,

22

say, is designed to focus on sellers of tires.

23

wouldn't automatically, as a matter of law, have to be

24

applied to entities that are selling cars instead.

25

the same is true here.

I mean, to give an example, carmax.com offers cars

Certainly, that's not

-- regime.
But don't you think that the

13

telecommunications aspect of what's going on here is at

14

least as important as the information aspect of it?

15

information is useless unless it can be conveyed.

16

MR. HUNGAR:

The

Well, the -- and, by the same

17

token, the transmission component is useless unless it

18

offers all of the -- all of the information-services type

19

functionality that Internet service offers.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Not necessarily.

You could --

21

you can use that broadband service to go to other

22

information providers.

23

MR. HUNGAR:

But, Your Honor, it's the -- it's

24

the capabilities that you purchase in the integrated

25

package -- not the pure transmission, but the other

capabilities, the computer data-processing, data-access

2

capabilities that are an essential part of that.

3

you had was the transmission, with none of the other

4

computer functionality -- if you typed in the Supreme

5

Court's Website, for instance, supremecourtus.gov, nothing

6

would happen, because all of the computer functionality,

7

like the domain-name system, which is a very

8

sophisticated, complex, distributed database involving

9

literally millions of computers around the world, that's

10

data processing.

11

that you use every time you type in a Website.

If all

That's information-services capability

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. HUNGAR:

I understand that.

It's not just transmission.

It's

14

much more than that.

15

computer data-processing aspects, it doesn't do anything.

16

And without the -- without the

I agree, but the question isn't

21

the end of it, and you're using this broadband to do all

22

sorts of good stuff, going where you want, getting what

23

you want, conveying what you want.

24

rules and I say, "You know, in the future the only way I'm

25

selling the broadband -- or offering the broadband to the

4

public?

Have I suddenly stopped

I just don't think that's a reasonable --

MR. HUNGAR:

Well --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. HUNGAR:

-- use of language.

-- well, two points.

Your question

8

starts with, I think, an incorrect assumption about the

9

nature of the world.

The pure transmission function has

10

not been offered to the public, to consumers, separately

11

and apart -- again, it doesn't do anything.

12

don't use the pure transmission functions by itself.

13

"Internet service," by definition, includes the data-

14

processing aspects that the Commission so found on this

15

record, and that factual determine is reasonable and

16

supported by the record.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Consumers

I was giving you a

I --

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, in the -- in the

20

hypothetical, it's conceivable that a different result

21

might be reached by the regulatory agency with authority

22

for construing the statute and applying it to particular

23

fact situations.

24

necessarily and always compels the conclusion that any

25

component of an integrated offering is also separately

But I don't think the word "offering"

8

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

being offered within the meaning of the statute.

2

depends on the purposes of the statute, as construed by

3

the regulatory agency.

4

therefore, what the agency has done here is reasonable.

5

It

"Offering" is ambiguous.

And,

And it's supported, I would add, by the

6

consistent pre-1996 regulatory approach in this area,

7

which all parties agreed Congress incorporated into the

8

1996 Act.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But if you do the same

10

combination over telephone lines, you say they are -- they

11

are selling --

12

MR. HUNGAR:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

Your Honor --- offering to the public

communications service.

15

MR. HUNGAR:

That's because the telephone

16

companies have always offered a standalone transmission

17

component which other -- which other ISPs can utilize.

18

They've done that because of the preexisting regulatory

19

regime.

20

therefore, it is a telecommunications service.

21

They've always made the separate offering;

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What bearing does history have

bundled offering of information technology and

communications, you are selling communications?

4

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, it's certainly not

5

unusual for this Court, in construing a statute, to look

6

to the regulatory history that led up to the enactment of

7

the statute, particularly where it's clear in the

8

legislative history that Congress was in -- was

9

essentially borrowing from the pre-1996 regulatory

10

definitions, the definitional scheme that the Commission

adopted in 1980 in its Computer II report.

agree that that definitional framework forms the

tentative decision the FCC has taken on the DSL

That's

Your Honor, the FCC has tentatively

concluded that when a telephone company makes an

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

-- telephone lines have

always been subject to common-carrier regulation.

3

MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct.

And even though --

4

when a telephone company is making a separate standalone

5

offering of just the pure DSL transmission capacity, which

6

is useful only to ISPs, to Internet Service Providers, not

7

to consumers, that that would be viewed, has traditionally

8

been viewed, as a common-carriage offering, because it's

9

pure transmission.

But when it's a bundled -- or when

10

it's an integrated offering -- again, this goes back to

11

1980.

12

the Commission in 1980, and it said, if the offering is

13

limited to pure transmission, it is basic

14

telecommunications, basic service, the precursor to

15

telecommunications service; but if you add any computer

16

functionality to the offering, then it is not basic, it is

enhanced service.

MR. HUNGAR:

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. HUNGAR:

It just doesn't seem to --

It depends on the nature of the

5

offering.

If the entity is offering -- if cable

6

companies, tomorrow, start offering pure cable

7

transmission on an -- on a nondiscriminate basis, that

8

would regulated as a telecommunications service.

9

the Commission has always said is that you look at the

But what

10

offering as a whole, and if it's a -- an integrated

11

offering that encompasses not just telecommunications, but

12

data-processing, and computer-type services, as well, it's

13

in the enhanced or information-service category that --

14

the Commission said, in 1980, "We're doing this, in part,

15

because it's not clear -- it's clear that Congress didn't

16

intend, in the 1934 Act, to extend regulation to this new

17

-- this novel, new type of intermingled service, and it

18

would be inappropriate, we think, to try and extend the

19

Act to that, for a number of reasons, including that it's

20

very hard to draw lines between which is -- which has more

21

of a communications versus data-processing component.

They had tried that, and concluded that it was

unworkable."

limited to that, it is on the telecommunications service,

It's peculiar.

I don't think so, Your Honor.

Respondents have attempted to mischaracterize or

misdescribe what is going on here.

15

in 1980, the FCC was regulating in an environment when

16

there was only one avenue into the home, one

17

communications avenue, the telephone line, and they said,

18

"Under these circumstances, telephone common carriers are

19

not going to be allowed to escape Title II regulation

20

completely by offering enhanced services, if they can

21

offer an enhanced service, an intermingled -- integrated

22

transmission and computer data-processing service, and

23

that service, as a whole, when it's offered, will be

unregulated, because Title II does not extend to those

The FCC has never said that an

integrated offering of DSL that -- DSL Internet service,

16

the combined integrated offering, the analog to what we

17

have here, in the cable context -- the FCC has never said

18

that that is not an information service.

19

they have tentatively concluded now that it is.

20

have said -- what they said in the 1998 order that

21

Respondents cite was that the telecommunications -- the

22

telephone companies are already offering DSL on a

23

standalone, pure-transmission basis to other competing

24

Internet Service Providers; therefore, it is a

25

telecommunications service.

They have -- and

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

that it was a telecommunications service.

2

reason they were doing that, we assume, is because the

3

preexisting Computer II and Computer III framework

4

required the telephone carriers to make that standalone

5

offering.

6

offering is also a telecommunications service, and it has

now tentatively concluded that it is an information

service, in keeping with 25 years of regulatory history

Well, any standalone, pure-

rationale, to the extent the Commission adheres to it --

15

and it hasn't overturned it yet; it's considering the

16

extent to which it should create an exception in the DSL

context -- but under Computer II, a basic, traditional

18

common carrier cannot get away -- cannot get out of Title

19

II regulation by offering an integrated offering.

will also have to make the standalone offering, unless and

21

to the extent the Commission determines that that's not

competitive that it's not necessary and there are adequate

saying a bundled offering isn't.

And the reason, you say,

Your Honor, I'm sorry, but -That's not my understanding --

-- that's --- of how definitions work.

Let me try to clarify what the

20

Commission's position is.

The Commission has never said,

21

that I am aware of or that Respondents have pointed out,

22

that the integrated -- bundled, if you will -- the

23

integrated offering of transmission plus Internet service

24

functionality is a telecommunications service.

25

never said that.

They have

They have said that some companies,

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

telephone common carriers, will be required to make the

2

separate offering, but it is not correct that the

3

integrated offering is, itself, going to be classified as

4

a telecommunications service.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

6

MR. HUNGAR:

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's classified --

So it's --

-- as information.
-- in effect, it's the

8

unbundling requirement which is your answer to Justice

9

Scalia's -- Why should that make a difference?

I mean,

10

you could just as well make an unbundling requirement with

11

respect to cable.

12

MR. HUNGAR:

You could.

And, in fact, the

13

Commission is -- has issued a notice of proposed

14

rulemaking and an invitation for comment in the order

15

under review here to consider whether it should make such

16

a requirement under its ancillary Title I authority in

17

this context, and what -- and, if so, to what extent?

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the reason for a

19

distinction, at least at the present time -- the reason

20

for the reasonableness of the distinction at the present

21

time, as a source of applying this definition, is history,

22

basically.

23

MR. HUNGAR:

me -- Internet service does not work unless you have

15

transmission from wherever the telephone call goes into

16

the central office, and it has to be transmitted from

17

there to the Internet Service Provider's point of presence

18

on the Internet, and from there out onto the Internet.

19

And Internet Service Providers either own or lease that

20

transmission capacity and offer that as part of the

21

bundled offering that they make.

22

But, of course, traditional information service

So every Internet Service Provider would be a

telecommunications carrier under their position, and that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL T. CAPPUCCIO

11

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 04-277

12
13
14

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Let me begin by trying to answer Justice

15

Scalia's question.

The question here, Justice, is, Are we

16

offering two products, or are we offering two ingredients

17

that come together to form a separate product?

18

would submit that if you go back and read paragraph 120 of

19

the Computer II order, 1980, that's exactly what Congress

20

said was happening.

21

-- not Congress, I'm sorry; the FCC, of course -- when you

22

take the communications component and the data-processing

23

component and combine them, they are ingredients into what

24

is a new offering, and a new and unregulated offering.

25

They said, "We can't separate them.

And I

What Congress said is, when you take

It's not useful to

2

ingredients, forming a product that is a distinct

3

product."

6

And we view them as two

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the -- what is the

data-processing part?
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

In the case of cable modem

7

service, Your Honor, it's a number of things.

8

ability to, for example, retrieve information from a

9

server that somebody has on the Web --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's the

So I guess, on that one, if, in

11

fact, you had a telephone system, and, at the other end of

12

the wire, Joe Smith, your friend, had recorded a message,

13

and when you rang the call, the service simply picked up

14

the message and played it to you, wouldn't it still be a

15

telephone system?

16

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Well, I think in your situation

17

-- in the hypothetical you give, Your Honor, that would be

18

somebody using just a regular transmission-only path to

19

hear what the other person --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

And how is this different?
Well, because here, in the

22

example that I used, for example -- it's certainly not the

23

only one -- it is the capacity to retrieve information

24

that is stored otherwise.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that follows, Your Honor -Information that other people

telecommunications than my answering service?

And not -- and not

necessarily --

5

Yes.

Well -You know, I pick up my

messages.

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

-- I would say, Your Honor, for

10

one thing, it fits squarely within the definition of

11

information service, which says --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, yes, of course it does,

13

and so does my answering service.

I got -- what about the next

You were going to -- what I want to do is write down

18

20

-- of those things that are not

telecommunications.
MR. CAPPUCCIO:

It's the ability to engage in --

to use your e-mail, it's the ability -JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the ability to engage or

24

use my e-mail is an ability to access messages that other

25

people, who don't work for you, have left for me.

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

But, anyway, what's the third

different.

you to browse the World Wide Web and to -- and to retrieve
information from the World Wide Web.

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, indeed.
Right.
What it is, is a system where I

pick up the phone, and what my phone does is -- let's say

15

it had the ability to survey a number of possible people

16

who wanted to talk to me.

17

from a phone to a computer or an information system?

18

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

Would that suddenly change it

The -Because the other people are

20

leaving the information; it's not the phone that's doing

21

it.

22

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Your Honor, the ability to

23

retrieve information that is stored somewhere out on a

24

server is not the raw transmission functionality.

25

more than that.

It is

It is what the Congress has said it is,
22

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it is the ability to retrieve information.

2

simply sending bits over a line and having those bits not

3

changed and not interfered with.

4

something from a server, you have to take it in form it is

5

on the server, you have to then put it through the

6

transmission system, and you have to reconvert it back

7

into what you want to see.

8

that is more than just sending information.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

It is not

When you retrieve

It's an interactive process

Rather like when I phone

10

Europe, and they take the message and turn it into

11

electronic packets, and they send it all over the world

12

and on computers and so forth, and it comes back to me

13

eventually, sounds a lot like my brother-in-law.

14

[Laughter.]

15

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

Yeah, I guess -- look, Your

16

Honor, I am not disputing that an information service has

17

a component of it that's communications.

18

have a component of it that's communication.

19

FCC said in Computer II is that when you combine the --

20

you combine the communications with, for example, the

21

data-retrieval function, that that combination of things

22

is no longer the two separate products, it is a new

23

enhanced service that is beyond Title II.

24
25

It may, indeed,
But what the

And, Justice Scalia, part of the evidence that
these are not two separate products is, if they were, then
23

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Congress never could have said if enhanced services were

2

outside of Title II.

3

and overruled, even though it's now 20 --

Computer II would have to be wrong

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. CAPPUCCIO:

6

The FCC -Yeah, I'm sorry, I keep saying

Congress; I meant the FCC.

7

The FCC could not have said that, because it

8

would have been forced -- if, as the theory goes, the

9

enhanced service has in it the separate product of

10

communications and has a separate status, then they

11

wouldn't have been able to take it out of Computer II.

12

But let me suggest, stepping back for a second

13

-- and, by the way, I should add that in this case, in the

14

paragraph 39 of the order under -- below, the FCC said the

15

two were not separable.

16

they are ingredients intertwined, they are not separate

17

products.

18

was to decide which of two things is happening.

19

two separate products?

20

McNuggets being bundled together?

21

ingredients that are so interwoven, as they said in

22

Computer II, as to form a distinct product? -- is a

23

classic example of what an agency does, and it's really

24

not one that this Court, I think, would be likely to

25

secondguess.

Okay?

I understand that to mean

the telephone companies do, in fact, provide the

14

that, Justice Souter, is, as Mr. Hungar said, historical,

15

though it wasn't without basis in reasons in history, but

16

they do, in fact, provide it separately.

17

Congress required them to do it through a separate

18

subsidiary in Computer II.

They wanted to avoid cross-subsidies, they were the only

20

platform, they were worried about discrimination.

There were reasons for that.

So is that really the nub of

the difference?

It's Congress that is requiring them to

whether the words "offering telecommunications" are

nothing in the English language, Justice Scalia, that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

red brief of the Respondents Earthlink, et al., because I

16

Mr. Chief Justice, cable modem service refers to

17

the bundled sale, purely for marketing reasons, of two

18

different things: highspeed telecommunications over cable

19

wires, and computer software, like e-mail, that you can

20

access over that highspeed telecommunications.

21

Commission admits -- and it is a critical admission --

22

that the standalone sale of the telecommunications piece

is a telecommunications service, notwithstanding that it

is on cable wires rather than telephone wires.

6

I think we can demonstrate that through the text of the

And

I'd like to take you to two provisions at the

9

The first one is on 2a of the appendix, and it

10

goes, Justice Souter, to the question of whether there's

11

some difference that Congress has adopted between

12

telephone wires and cable wires.

13

question is, no.

14

"telecommunications service," this is the provision that

15

leads to common-carrier regulation.

16

"telecommunications service" means "the offering of

17

telecommunications for a fee directly to the public or to

18

such classes of users as to be effectively available

19

directly to the public" -- and here is the critical clause

20

-- "regardless of the facilities used."

22

cable wire versus telephone.

Now, that's the answer to the question,

Let me now step back to what the FCC said in its

7

ruling.

The FCC backed into its decision here, and it

8

will turn on the definition of "information service,"

9

which will be on 1a of the appendix.

It said this.

Look,

10

cable modem service fits within the definition of an

11

"information service."

12

construe the definition of an "information service" to be

13

mutually exclusive of a telecommunications service.

14

that is legal error.

15

definition.

It's this bundled thing.

And we

And

And let me take you through the

16

Subparagraph 20, information service.

17

"information service" means the offering of a capability

18

for, in a variety of things -- generating, acquiring,

19

storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing,

20

or making available information -- via telecommunications.

21

That is not language of exclusivity; it is language of

22

dependence.

23

If you all came to the court today via car, or I came via

24

metro, there was a car or a train involved.

25

There has to be telecommunications involved.

Now, I want to contrast that with another series

of statutory provisions.

demonstrate, beyond peradventure, that Congress address

3

the problem you are now facing.

4

that there are definitional provisions that might

5

otherwise fall within the definition of 'common carriage.'

6

And if we don't want it to be a common carrier, we will

7

tell you expressly."

And what these provisions do is

It said, "We recognize

There are four of them.

the exclusion that appears at the bottom of the

11

definition, three lines from the bottom, "But a person

12

engaged in radio broadcasting shall not, insofar as such

13

person is so engaged, be deemed a common carrier."

14

There's nothing like that for "information services."

15

be particularly illustrative.

Justice Scalia, you are quite right, this is a

case about a statute, and the language has none of the

indications that the Commission is relying on here.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it does have this, that

18

what -- if you look at the definition of

19

"telecommunications," it means "transmitting information

20

without change in the form or content of the information."

21

Now, in respect to some of their services -- not, maybe, a

22

lot, but in response to some -- they certainly change the

23

content and the form.

24

there are a number of others that do.

25

says the FCC -- I look to "telecommunications service."

E-mail, for example, does.

And

So the language,

1

They provide telecommunications service sometimes, and

2

sometimes this other thing, as well, and it's all bundled.

3

And we read the word "offering" to mean "offering

4

separately."

5

a bundled service is not a person who's offering a

6

telecommunications service.

7

trying to understand their argument.

8

that argument is logical, and it fits the language.

telecommunications piece, we're going to call it a "basic

The D.C. Circuit, however, rejected that conclusion, the

one that's being proposed here by the Commission, as a

could not have been intended because it would allow the

becomes completely circular.

looking at the competitive necessity, market power, the

I think it's a very fair

But also, Justice Breyer, I think -- you

know, I think we're all on the same page about what

5

Congress intended, and that is, first of all, Congress was

6

aware of cable modem service.

7

the Court's opinion in Gulf Power.

8

the cable industry in Gulf Power itself.

9

there are several statutory provisions that refer to cable

That's said expressly in
It was emphasized by
There is --

10

11

what they said is this, "We have broad encompassing

12

definitions, and that is, it's not going to make a

13

difference if you combine two things together.

14

Commission, you go make those" -- Justice Breyer, all the

15

findings you're talking about are listed in the section 10

16

forbearance proceedings.

17

But, Justice Breyer,

But,

Now, imagine the world as the Commission sees

18

it.

It says that forbearance applies to

19

telecommunications service.

20

that aren't telecommunications service, it's "Katie bar

21

the door."

22

regulatory scheme is that?

23

Commission is constrained with respect to its expertise.

24

But things that are information services that are outside

25

telecommunications, it can do whatever it wants.

But when it comes to things

We don't have any rules.

What kind of logical

And that is that the

47

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Breyer, I did want to make one

2

additional point, and that is, again, there is a statutory

3

provision here that addresses their claim that they can

4

force you to provide telecommunications service, and that

5

is the definition of a "telecommunications carrier."

6

it is on 2a.

7

with the second sentence of the definition, "A

8

telecommunications carrier shall be treated as a common

9

carrier under this Act only to the extent that it is

10
11

And

I read the exception, so now I'm dealing

engaged in providing telecommunications services."
This lines up perfectly with this Court's

12

decision in Midwest Video.

13

it -- what regulation you could impose on broadcasters.

14

This one says, "You are only going to be a common carrier

15

if you're providing a telecommunications service."

16

the FCC has this vision that it can, sort of, solve all

17

the problems through its raw discretion and to force

18

someone to provide common carriage.

19

very clear, if you are not providing a telecommunications

20

service, you are not going to be a telecommunications

21

carrier; and, therefore, you are not going to be providing

22

common carriage.

23

There was a constraint on what

But

But the statute's

And, as I've said, I don't understand how it is,

24

even if one looked at this particular context, you could

25

decide that Congress thought the bundle made regulation
48

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

less regulated -- less necessary, rather than more

2

regulated -- more necessary.

3

I want, next, if I could, to talk about the

4

notion that you can self-deregulate, and how utterly

5

implausible this is, how is it that the Commission could

6

imagine that Congress created the following regime.

7

that is, if you want to provide common carriage, you'll be

8

subject to this regulation; but if you don't feel like it,

9

well, that's okay.

And

That will render the definition of

10

"telecommunications service" -- if you just want to tack

11

e-mail onto the thing, that will render the definition of

12

"telecommunications service" -- in the Internet, you're a

13

dead letter, because who in the world would ever do it?

14

If it's up to the regulated entity, why in the world would

15

anyone provide common carriage?

16

I think this has, actually, a remarkable

17

parallel to the Court's decision in the Oneida Indian

18

Nation case, where the Court rejected the suggestion that

19

what you could do is -- that it would be up to the Indians

20

to decide whether or not they would be able to get

21

property back.

22

unilaterally reassert sovereign control and remove those

23

parcels from the local tax rolls, little would prevent the

24

And then, Justice Ginsburg, the opinion goes on

5

to talk about section 465, which is exactly like section

10 forbearance, "Recognizing these practical concerns,

Congress has provided a mechanism for the acquisition of

You can't

Now, let me return to, then, Mr. Cappuccio's

suggestion, Justice Scalia, that this is an ingredient,

it's not a product.

19

there's no mention of ingredients or products in the

statute.

question under the definition of "telecommunications

service" is, Are you providing telecommunications?

25

bet, it's kind of expensive, actually.

The straightforward answer is,

It says "telecommunications service."

Sure, anybody can buy it.

that Congress cared about.

Now, this is not a question of whether or not

there's butter in a cake, because you -- it -- there are

two reasons.

telecommunications is the same; it hasn't been "cooked"

into something else.

The first is, fundamentally, the

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

The second is, the reason all those

12

hypotheticals are -- wheels and cars and those sorts of

13

things -- don't make any sense here is that they assume a

14

few things.

15

that gets regulated.

17

it's never regulated at all.

18

poof, escapes all regulation.

the car example, it's because there's -- the reason it has

intuitive appeal is that there's a regulatory scheme about

Right.

The first is, they're assuming a first sale

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER IN 04-281

8

MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

9

Turning first to the question of the regulatory

10

history, Respondents continue to rely on the fact that,

11

under Computer II, the FCC required telephone common

12

carriers to separate out and separately offer the basic

13

transmission component.

14

refutes Respondent's attempts to rely on history, Congress

15

did not -- excuse me -- the FCC did not impose that

16

requirement on enhanced service providers.

17

entities called "value-added networks" that obtained the

18

telecommunications functionality, bundled it together with

19

information servicing protocol conversion-type computer

20

functions, and offered that bundled service as an enhanced

21

service.

22

is an unregulated enhanced-service offering, it is not

23

subject to Title II of the Act, because we don't think

24

Congress intended Title II, which is aimed at traditional

25

telephone communications, to deal with this new form of

But, importantly, and what

There were

And the Commission said, in Computer II, "That

2

even though it is true that there was a communications

component.

4

or that value-added network should have been required to

5

make it file a tariff and comply with all the regulations

of Title II of the Act.

cites the orders discussing this fact.

It is not regulated,

And, under Respondent's rationale, that offer

And in addition, under Computer II, the
Commission required AT&T and, later, the Regional Bell

Operating Companies, if they were going to offer enhanced

11

services, to offer them separately through subsidiaries,

unregulated subsidiaries, even though they were offering

13

bundles of enhanced service and telecommunications, the

15

their parent corporation.

16

was unregulated.

17

But the entire bundled offering

And that's been true for 25 years.

And, again, Congress, in 1996, gave no

18

indication that it was overturning this well-established

19

situation in which enhanced services, now information

20

services, were not regulated.

21

Congress, in an act that talks about preserving the hands-

22

off approach to the Internet, in fact, regulated all

23

Internet Service Providers in a way that they had never

24

been regulated before, we submit, is certainly an unlikely

25

interpretation of the act, and clearly demonstrates that

And to suggest that

1

the FCC was reasonable in rejecting that position.

2

Justice Breyer, you asked about voicemail or

3

similar type systems that would preserve a message.

If

4

provided by a computer functionality, that service is an

5

information service.

6

But the FCC has at least suggested that voicemail and

7

basic telecommunications -- if a telephone company tried

8

to offer it -- say, "We're going to offer this bundled,

9

and we don't think it's regulated," telephone companies

Voicemail is an information service.

10

try that sort of thing from time to time, and then the FCC

11

is faced with a decision, in its discretion, of whether

12

that should be viewed as an integrated offering or,

13

instead, as really two things that have just been added

14

together but aren't really -- that are really two distinct

15

services.

16

that telephone service and voicemail service, even if

17

they're bundled together, are two distinct services.

18

And the FCC has suggested, in that context,

And there's an important difference, I think,

19

between that type of offering and the one here.

You can

20

use your -- even if your telephone company offers you

21

voicemail, obviously, you -- a lot of your use of the

22

telephone system has nothing to do with the voicemail;

23

it's pure telephony, pure telecommunications; whereas,

24

with cable modem service, every time you use it,

25

essentially, you are utilizing at least some of the data54
