ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO A. LANGE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LANGE:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
Stay and abeyance is the proper way to

11

administer the total exhaustion rule under the unique

12

facts of this case.

13

already have endorsed stay and abeyance, and seven of the

14

eight circuit courts of appeals that have considered the

15

issue have permitted stay and abeyance under similar

16

circumstances.

17

Several Justices of this Court

Section 2254 and the decisions of this Court in

18

Granberry v. Greer and Strickland v. Washington make clear

19

that exhaustion is not a jurisdictional requirement.

20

District courts have the inherent authority and the broad

21

discretion to issue stays in cases that are within their

22

jurisdiction.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think that's unquestionable.

24

The -- the issue really is whether it's an abuse of that

25

discretion to -- to grant a stay and abeyance when the --

1

the petitioner comes before the court for habeas without

having exhausted in State court.

3

question.

4

power to -- to stay proceedings, but is it an abuse of

5

discretion to do so in these circumstances given the

6

statute that -- that wants a 1-year, prompt resort to the

7

Federal courts.

8
9

I mean, that's the

I think everybody will stipulate that there's

MR. LANGE:

Justice Scalia, I agree with your

framing of the issue.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

MR. LANGE:

Okay.

And I also believe that a stay under

12

these circumstances is appropriate under the statutes,

13

section 2254 and 2244, and is consistent with those

14

statutes.

15

his concurrence in Duncan v. Walker, that prohibits the --

16

the granting of a stay under circumstances such as these.

17

Indeed --

18

There is nothing, as Justice Souter noted in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, there's no -- there's no

19

abuse of discretion here.

20

interest in having all of the claims exhausted?

21

it's no more -- if it's as broad as that, then there's no

22

AEDPA statute of limitations.

23

MR. LANGE:

Why?

Because we have an

No, Your Honor.

If -- if

I believe there is

24

no abuse of the discretion here because if a stay had

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, why shouldn't -- why

2

shouldn't the petitioner for habeas have to first go to

3

the State court and exhaust the State court claims?

4

that wasn't done.

State claims, for goodness sakes.

court?

MR. LANGE:

Why shouldn't those

Well, in an ideal world, they would

10

be presented in the first instance, but we're dealing with

a -- a world where 93 percent of petitioners are

12

proceeding pro se.

force a petitioner to present unexhausted claims in State

14

Your Honor, stay and abeyance does

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

At the price of suspending the

16

1-year statute of limitations that Congress thought was

central to AEDPA.

MR. LANGE:

No, Your Honor.

I do not see this

as a suspension of the statute of limitations.

20

met the AEDPA statute of limitations.

21

by the State's own admission, 8 to 14 days had run on his

22

1-year AEDPA statute of limitations.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Rhines

He filed when only,

Well, but it's a free ride if

24

you say -- so long as you get in within the 1-year period,

25

the court can then give you another 3 years or as long as

Washington, DC 20005

1

the court thinks is reasonable for you to go back and --

2

and do what you were supposed to do before you arrived.

3

mean, that seems to me is a frustration of the 1-year

4

statute of limitations.

5

MR. LANGE:

I disagree that that is a free ride,

6

and I do not see that as a frustration of the 1-year

7

statute of limitations when a petitioner has met the

8

1-year statute of limitations.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

thought people should apply first to State court and, when

20

I mean, what do we do to encourage the procedure
Congress did want all this compressed and

But this -- this scheme does something

MR. LANGE:

Your Honor, Congress wanted to

21

compress certainly the time between exhaustion of the

22

State remedies and the time when the petitioner came to

Federal court.

24

while there is any proceeding going in -- in State court.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there a difference --

5

would you say there's a difference between a case where

6

the petitioner comes into Federal court in the first

7

instance with this laundry list or as, if I recall

8

correctly, this case, goes first to the State court and

9

then, when it's dismissed from the State court, comes to

10

Federal court with the same basic list which has been

11

exhausted, plus others which have not?

12

distinguish the case on the propriety of stay and abeyance

13

of passing up the State court, going to Federal court

14

first, going to State court with your pro se petition

15

raising a bunch of claims but not all of them, and then

16

coming to Federal court?

17

MR. LANGE:

Would you

18

circumstances which of those two hypotheticals present a

19

more compelling case for stay and abeyance.

the vast majority of the 35 separate claims that he has

raised.

longer than 16 months, Your Honor.

11

referred to 16 months, but it's almost 2 and a half years,

12

from February of 2000 to July of 2002, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The district court

One of the problems is that

14

the statute encourages prompt resolution in -- in the

15

Federal system as well, and under a stay and abey

16

procedure, you could have a district judge who lets the

17

matter sit for 9-10 months and all of a sudden issues a

18

stay and abey.

19

How are we going to control that?

MR. LANGE:

Your Honor, I think the alternative

20

that the State proposes presents an even more troubling

21

illustration.

22

its own -- at its own rate, grant a stay, grant the terms

23

of the stay as it sees fit, and I believe that takes care

24

of the consideration that -- that Your Honor's question

25

indicated, Justice Kennedy.

A district court, of course, can proceed at

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

The suggestion of the State sets up a situation

2

where, according to the State, they want Rhines to purge

3

his -- his claim -- his petition of the unexhausted claims

4

and proceed in State court at the same time, which is

5

unseemly to have Mr. Rhines proceeding on 27 exhausted

6

claims in Federal court at the same time that he is

7

proceeding on 8 claims in State court.

Now, South Dakota is a little bit unique.
it allows a second State habeas action.

There's no time

10

bar to a second State habeas action.

indigent prisoners are entitled to representation of

counsel in their first habeas.

MR. LANGE:

Your Honor, the problem is the eight

18

claims that he is now exhausting in State court, if the

19

State's approach is taken, he forever sacrifices, loses

20

the right to Federal review of those eight claims.

So --

Thank you for throwing me the life

I --

(Laughter.)

13

MR. LANGE:

I understand this Court grants fewer

14

than 1 percent of the cases, so as a practical matter, for

15

there to be an independent review, as contemplated by

16

section 2254(a), it does require a district court's

17

involvement.

18

cert can't be expected to -- to conduct that review.

19

As a practical matter, this Court on -- on

2254(a), which is the statute that grants

20

jurisdiction, does indicate that a Federal court shall

clear in (b)(2) and (b)(3) that it is not jurisdictional.

MR. LANGE:

I don't believe so anymore than you

4

would have to reverse in part Rose v. Lundy to go with the

5

State's view.

6

And let me explain.

The approach of stay and abeyance is more

7

consistent with the principles of Rose v. Lundy than the

9

concerned about comity and federalism.

In Rose, this Court was

would not unreasonably impair the petitioner's right and

would give the petitioner the choice of either purging the

unexhausted claims or going back to State court,

23

court with one fully exhausted --

Again, Congress granted

Congress was not attempting to frustrate

10

or impede the petitioner's right to seek State court

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, but Congress, I think

13

under this scheme, envisioned having someone make all the

14

State claims the first time around, gather them up and go

15

to State court, and let them take as long as they like --

16

no statute will run until that's complete -- and then go

17

to the Federal court.

18

that approach.

MR. LANGE:

And this does an end run around

20

does an end run because this is different than -- than

Also, Mr. Rhines has complied with the AEDPA
period.

He did file.

4

The unusual situation that could result here is

if you assume a prisoner B who's in Rhines' same position

6

and files at the same time, when only approximately 9 days

7

have elapsed on his AEDPA period.

8

assume, files three claims:

21

situation, it's simply unfair to someone in Rhines' place

22

to have his right to a review of the eight unexhausted

claims cut short because he had a complicated case or the

district court was slow in getting to a decision.

25

I mean, it depends on when the court

What do you do about -- about our opinion in --

4

in Duncan v. Walker where we refused to toll the

5

limitation period during the pendency of a -- of the

6

Federal proceeding and -- and said, in -- in justification

7

of that holding, by tolling the limitation period for the

8

pursuit of State remedies and not during the pendency of

9

applications for Federal review, 2244 provides a powerful

10

incentive for litigants to exhaust all available State

11

remedies before proceeding in the lower Federal courts?

12

You are now urging us to eliminate that incentive

13

entirely.

14

MR. LANGE:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. LANGE:

No, Your Honor.
Why not?

I believe there's always a very

17

powerful incentive to prisoners to exhaust in full because

18

if they file a mixed petition, they're not going to have

19

relief.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

MR. LANGE:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Sometimes --

(b)(1) says it shall not be granted.
Well, you said -- you said in

your brief that -- that it's always in the -- with the

24

possible exception of capital cases, it's always in the

25

interest of a habeas applicant to get -- get it decided as

The district
It can alter

I believe that is a decision that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you think the procedure

24

should be any different between capital cases and

25

noncapital cases?

We're basically talking about what

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

would be an abuse of discretion, as you indicated at the

2

outset.

3

or do you think there might be -- because there is a

4

greater incentive to delay in the capital case than there

5

is in the noncapital case.

6

Do you think the same rule should apply to both,

MR. LANGE:

You're right, Justice Stevens.

I --

7

it's difficult to develop a rule that distinguishes

8

between the two classes, but I do believe that's in the

9

realm of the discretion of the district court.

The

10

district court can set very tight deadlines on a

11

petitioner returning to State court to exhaust remaining

12

remedies like the Court here set a deadline of 60 days,

13

and in the circuit courts, more commonly the deadline is

14

30 days to go back to State court and then 30 days to

15

return once the State proceeding is -- is completed.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you -- you don't really

17

think we can hold that line, giving less favorable

18

treatment to somebody who's -- who's trying to argue

19

against a capital penalty, less favorable treatment to him

20

than somebody who's -- who just wants to avoid 10 years in

21

jail?

22

That's just not going to work.
MR. LANGE:

I'm not advocating less favorable

23

treatment or more favorable treatment for that matter.

24

believe the rule has to be consistent between the two.

Isn't that what would happen in -- in most other

MR. LANGE:

I think that's an excellent point

4

and on footnotes 9 and 10 of the yellow brief, there is a

5

litany of the State procedural rules, and many States

6

would bar a second habeas or would put a strict time limit

7

that the petitioner could not meet.

8

different in that regard.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. LANGE:

South Dakota is

Yes.

South Dakota allows a second habeas

11

and, indeed, allows a petitioner in a second habeas to

12

show cause for a default by proving that he received

13

ineffective assistance of habeas counsel, which is unique

14

among the States.

15

Yes, many States that don't allow a second

16

remedy would -- would not -- we would not be in this

17

situation that we are here.

18

And in fairness to Mr. Rhines, it makes sense to stay the

19

Federal petition and to allow him to exhaust his State

20

court remedies on satisfaction of Rose and to come back

21

with a fully exhausted claim.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

However, South Dakota does.

Unless what would happen in

23

these other States as the -- is that the court would grant

24

Do you think the Federal court would simply make

MR. LANGE:

I don't

I -- I believe that would -- could

7

be and -- and should be a factor in a district court's

8

consideration of whether to grant stay and abeyance, Your

9

Honor.

10
11
12

The State has expressed concerns about delay.
There are four reasons why those concerns are overstated.
First, in the 3 and a half years since Duncan v.

13

Walker was decided, there have been cases in circuit

14

courts of appeals that have approved of the stay and

15

abeyance procedure.

16

is being misused or is causing undue delay.

17

None of those cases evidence that it

Second, the terms of the stay themselves can

18

restrict a petitioner's delay, as I've already recounted

19

the -- the district court did here.

20

Third, this Court in Slack v. McDaniel addressed

21

very similar arguments to what the State is making now

22

about delay through a second habeas filing.

23

this Court noted that the Rules of Civil Procedure vest

24

courts with flexibility to prevent vexatious or delayed

25

litigation and that there are other reasons why those

And this --

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

concerns expressed in Slack v. McDaniel were -- were

2

overwrought.

3

Fourth and finally, on the prospect of delay, as

4

already mentioned in answer to one of Justice Scalia's

5

questions, the vast majority of petitioners are not under

6

a capital sentence.

7

percent of Federal section 2254 habeas petitioners are not

8

serving -- are not under a capital penalty.

Unless there are other questions, I'd reserve my

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE E. LONG

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MR. LONG:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
Congress -- excuse me.

Congress carefully

crafted a scheme designed to encourage State prisoners

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

first to exhaust all of their State post-conviction

2

remedies and then to file their habeas corpus petitions as

3

soon as possible.

4

mutually dependent statutes, including a 1-year statute of

5

limitations, a tolling provision, and a total exhaustion

6

requirement, the combined effect of which is supposed to

7

reduce delay, serve the principles of comity, finality,

8

and federalism.

9

The congressional design includes three

However, stay and abeyance erodes each side of

10

this triangular statutory design.

11

allows tolling in Federal court when Duncan said there

12

should be none.

13

beyond 1 year, and it ignores the total exhaustion

14

requirement of 2254(b).

15

prisoners, especially capital prisoners, are encouraged to

16

file mixed petitions and rewarded with delay if they do

17

so.

18

Stay and abeyance

It extends the statute of limitations

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The result is that State

What -- what is your answer to

19

-- to your -- your brother's answer on this, and -- and

20

that is, that the -- the existence of stay and abey as a

21

possibility is not a right to stay and abey?

22

if a district judge finds that a -- there is reason to

23

believe that the defendant is gaming the system, because

24

he's a capital defendant and wants to delay or wants delay

25

for any other reason, there's -- there's no requirement

And -- and

21
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that -- that there be a stay and -- and abeyance order.

2

And why -- why doesn't that take care of what I -- I think

3

is a very legitimate issue that you raise?

4

a -- a sufficient answer to it?

5

MR. LONG:

Why isn't that

I think that -- I think that the --

6

the answer is that Congress designed the system to resolve

7

all those issues in State court first.

8

things that needs to be kept in mind is that an

9

unexhausted claim is, by its very nature and by

I think one of the

10

definition, a claim where there's an available remedy in

11

State court.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, again, there's no question

13

about that.

14

perfect system, I think your objection would be

15

unanswerable.

16

And -- and in a perfect -- sort of in a

The trouble with the system we've got is -- is

17

the trouble that -- that is -- is undisputed here, and

18

that is, that most of these petitions, the overwhelming

19

number of them, are going to be pro se petitions.

20

Exhaustion can -- can be tricky.

21

limitations is -- is going to run and -- and an individual

22

can end up in the -- in the situation that this one had.

23

The -- the statute of

What -- what he's asking for, in effect, is how

24

do we tinker with the system, in effect, to prevent its

25

being a -- a very unfair burden on people who don't have

the sophistication to help themselves.
MR. LONG:

I don't think the system needs to be

tinkered with, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I -- I know but there's

5

-- what -- what is your answer on the merits to the fact

6

that most of the people who are going to ask for stay and

7

abey are -- are going to be pro ses, or at least have

8

gotten into the mess that they're in as a result of pro se

9

representation, and -- and that -- that exhaustion in

10

close cases can be a very -- very tricky issue?

11

what's your response to that?

12

MR. LONG:

What --

My response is in two parts.

First

13

of all, Your Honor, I agree with you that exhaustion can

14

be a tricky issue, but it's -- it's the most tricky in the

15

question about whether or not the question has been fairly

16

presented.

17

whether or not the claim is unexhausted, having been --

18

that means there's an available remedy in State court.

19

The easy way to sort that out is just to file your claim

20

in State court.

21

then you get tolling, and that solves the problem.

22

The less tricky portion of the question is

If there is in fact an available remedy,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I --

I'm not sure -- I'm not sure

23

it's -- it's true, are you, that -- that the reason people

24

get into these situations is because they were pro se.

25

That wasn't the case here.

I -- I think they probably get

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

into this situation very often because they have a better

2

or at least a different lawyer at the Federal habeas stage

3

than they had at the State habeas stage, and this new

4

lawyer sees additional claims that -- that he wants to

5

make.

6

Isn't -- isn't that exactly what happened here?
MR. LONG:

That's -- I -- I suspect that's the

7

typical case in -- in capital cases.

8

currently --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Mr. Rhines is

It's typical.

I mean, what I

10

have in the statistics is that about 36 percent of all the

11

habeases are dismissed for failure to exhaust, and 93

12

percent of all of the habeas petitioners are pro se.

13

the conclusions I draw for that is it's probably these pro

14

se people -- I mean, 93 percent are pro se -- that will get

15

the procedural dismissals, and certainly a third or so, if

16

we agree with you, of all of the habeas petitions filed

17

in -- in Federal court are going to be finished,

18

terminated.

19

20

Now,

The door is closed because it takes a Federal

21

closed the door of the Federal court to a third of all the

22

habeas petitioners.

wanted that, then I might say fine.

25

And if I had thought that Congress

pretty good point on the language, to tell you the truth.

2

But what I didn't think they had such a -- I mean, I

couldn't find much of a congressional purpose one way or

the other there.

10

strong that you want to knock a third of the petitioners

I think it's less complicated than

to your argument is that claims are unexhausted by

24

definition if there's an available State court remedy.

Therefore, by definition, they ought to be going to the

one of the answers to the observation that the Federal

court is closed to a third of the claims is that that's

not true with respect to the exhausted claims.

MR. LONG:

The -- the

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. LONG:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you --

Please.
-- with respect to this case?

12

I thought this case was such a good illustration of the

13

problem.

14

labeled, exhausted, unexhausted, then I think that you

15

would have a very strong argument.

16

illustrates, the question of whether it's been exhausted

17

or not is something on which people can disagree.

18

suppose why the district court took well over a year to

19

decide this case is the petitioner says, I've exhausted

20

everything, and the prosecutor says, you have not

21

exhausted 12.

22

going over these one by one and says in the end, you're

23

both wrong.

24

has this claim been exhausted.

25

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

withholding a case from State court and bringing it up

2

fresh in -- in the Federal court, that would be a case

3

where the Federal court should say, go away, you didn't

4

even try.

5

really hard to tell whether the claim has been exhausted?

6
7
8

10
11

But what do you do with these cases where it's

MR. LONG:

That was not the situation in this

case, Your Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then why did the -- the

district judge says four on the State's list have been
exhausted?
MR. LONG:

Well, the -- factually the court --

12

the court examined the amended petition and concluded that

13

eight claims in the amended petition were unexhausted.

14

The problem is this -- or -- or at least the variance in

15

the facts from what you suggest is this.

16

an amended petition in November of 2000 with counsel,

17

after having been through all the record.

And so there isn't tricky question about whether there

2

were unexhausted claims in this petition.

3

Now, that was in November of 2000.

He waited

until the court decided the decision in July of 2002 and

didn't pursue his State court remedies until the court

19

you're saying, district judge, you would be abusing your

20

discretion because admitting that he hadn't exhausted

21

these, he should have gone immediately to do that.

22

But what about the other four?

23

MR. LONG:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even without going back to the

3

State court, I don't see anything in this statute which

4

indicates that Congress expected everybody who comes into

5

Federal court with unexhausted claims to have time to

6

remedy that defect by running back to State court and --

7

and filing.

8

indication.

9

This statute doesn't give any such

And it's clear that will never happen if he

10

files on the 364th day after the conclusion of the State

11

proceedings.

12

Even if the judge decides the question the next morning,

13

it's too late.

Right?

I mean, his year is up already.

14

So I -- I don't know why we have to be concerned

15

about giving him some entitled second chance to go back to

that -- that guarantees or that even envisions that.

The -- but the -- the question that I would have

is, is there anything the other way?

you know, I was dissenting and the thing that sort of

moved me is I couldn't imagine Congress really cared about

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there anything that

Not that I've found, Your Honor.
Either way.
If that's so, then why isn't

17

a system like the one that the Second Circuit described

18

the most reasonable thing to do, that is, to put very

19

tight deadlines both on the petitioner and on the Federal

20

court, that is, to deny -- deny the stay and abey when the

21

prisoner has not been diligent, to put a tight time line

22

on when that prisoner has to go to State court, and a

23

similarly tight line on returning to the Federal court

24

after the State court is done?

only one opportunity to do it.

2

MR. LONG:

I think the answer to the question,

3

Your Honor, is that in order to follow the Second Circuit

4

as you've described, this Court would have to rewrite the

5

interpretation of the exhaustion statute that they issued

6

in Rose v. Lundy.

7

-- or the statute, as interpreted by Rose v. Lundy

8

indicates that at a minimum, the unexhausted claims ought

9

to be dismissed without prejudice and sent back for

10

That's my belief because Rose v. Lundy

exhaustion in State court.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But Rose and Lundy also assumed

12

that they could go back to State court and -- and in -- in

13

fact this could be done without wiping out the claims.

14

And the difference between the situation in Rose and Lundy

15

and the situation we've got now is the difference which is

16

focused, I think, in -- in Justice Ginsburg's four claims

17

as to which there was disagreement even between the

18

district court and -- and the State as to whether there

19

was exhaustion.

20

a systemic matter across the United States, there simply

21

isn't a way for most of these people to go back and

22

litigate their State claims.

23

was.

24
25

There -- there isn't a -- a -- as a -- as

Rose and Lundy assumed there

Now there isn't.
MR. LONG:

Your Honor, if the petitioner is not

capable of going back to litigate the State claim, the

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And --

It may not be -- it -- it will

be waived.

4

jumps from the frying pan of nonexhaustion into the fire

5

of waiver.

6

I mean, if -- if -- on your theory, he -- he

That's -- that's no answer to the problem.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

See, you could -- there are

7

two things in Rose v. Lundy, and everybody agrees with the

8

one, you must exhaust in State court.

9

Federal court take a first view of that question.

You cannot have the

you must exhaust.

12

prejudice not based on the defendant's conduct, not based

13

on the petitioner's conduct, but because it took the

14

district court more than the limitation period just to

15

sort out which claims were exhausted and which weren't.

16

MR. LONG:

And -- but then Rose v. Lundy also said

I think there are two responses to

17

that, Your Honor.

18

whether it is without prejudice in fact or in law is

19

driven by how much time is left on the statute of

20

limitations.

21

the amended petition was filed in this case would have

22

left 80 days on the statute and he could have pursued his

23

-- his remedy in State court and tolled the statute.

25

First of all, the -- the fact of

A dismissal without prejudice at the time

Now, in the -- in the more common situation with
the habeas petitioner, I think the answer has to be

that they enacted and that this Court has interpreted.

into the computation.

They have changed the

Now, I think that that simply raises the bar for

8

all petitioners to make doubly sure that if they have a

9

claim, they have presented it to a State court judge

10
11

because they -- they -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, the -- the troublesome

12

thing is some petitioners will be able to do just what you

13

said in South Dakota, go back to the State court a second

14

time, because they had a swift district judge, and some

15

won't because the district judge was slow.

of any lapse on the petitioner's part but solely because

one had the luck to get before a swift district judge and

that seems arbitrary and not anything that Congress built

into the statute.

MR. LONG:

So to treat

of these cases, I say if they came rushing to the Federal

them a stay so they can go to the first -- first time.

8

But these -- these come up where someone has

gone to the State court and then they come to the Federal

The -- there's the -- the difficulty

18

in the stay and abeyance procedure, as it is currently

19

practiced, I think, is that there is no set of standards,

20

other than the three statutes that we've -- that we have

21

discussed, to guide the district court's discretion in

22

when they give stay and abeyance.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

General Long, do -- do those

24

States that apply stay and abey make a distinction between

MR. LONG:

Well, I think the predicate to

3

getting stay and abeyance, Your Honor, is that there has

4

to be at least the presence of one exhausted claim and one

5

unexhausted --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. LONG:

Why should that be?

Well, I think that that follows from

8

-- I think that follows from Rose v. Lundy which talked

9

about a mixed petition and that's the -- that's the

10
11

factual background.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you get a second bite, why

12

shouldn't you get a first bite?

13

-- I don't see any reason for treating preferentially the

14

-- the person who files in State court but does not file

15

new claims, which he should have known to file at that

16

time, and treating the person who comes to the Federal

17

court with those new claims but doesn't have -- doesn't

have even one that he took to State court.

see any reason to be merciful to one and not the other.

I think so, yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Whereas, if there's one

(Laughter.)

11

MR. LONG:

I -- I think this, Your Honor.

I --

12

I think the court, faced with a mixed petition, ought to

13

first ask why have you not -- if -- if there is truly an

14

unexhausted claim in this petition, why did you not

15

present that claim previously in State court.

16

that, if -- if the -- if the answer to that is not

17

satisfactory, I think that the -- I think that that ought

18

to be tested on, for example, the cause and prejudice

19

standard or the actual innocence or fundamental

20

miscarriage of justice standards which this Court has

21

announced to cure procedural defaults in extreme cases.

22

And after

But in the absence of those type of standards, I

23

think that stay and abeyance has been simply applied too

24

broadly and this case is a classic example of the

misapplication of stay and abeyance.

that we could have a rule, oh, somewhat like the grant of

reason for maybe mistake and not having exhausted, then --

I mean, they

Would you adopt that or would you insist just

MR. LONG:

Well, our first position, obviously,

24

is no stay and abey at all, that the unexhausted claims

25

ought to be dismissed, as the Eighth Circuit said in this

case.

2

there is going to be a remedy in State court, and State

3

courts are perfectly capable of identifying constitutional

4

remedies and -- and meting out the requirements.

5

-- I've had South Dakota judges send murder cases back to

6

me to try after 12 years, and it's -- it's a burdensome

7

thing, and those cases need to move forward.

8
9

And if they -- if they are truly unexhausted, then

I've had

But what I would envision, Justice Kennedy, is
this, that the rule ought to be that -- that the -- the --

10

that the case is sent back to State court if there is

11

truly, as -- as the name implies, an unexhausted claim,

12

implying that there is an available State remedy.

13

if resolution in the State courts does not resolve it, if

14

the case comes back in some fashion, then the court needs

15

to apply some standards like cause and prejudice or

16

fundamental miscarriage of justice, which -- which is what

17

is applied in -- in procedural default cases, and -- and

18

deal with it on that basis.

why the petitioner hadn't been prudent and hadn't been

simply is -- is -- it's unguided.

to ask you to comment on one thought.

19

Thank you, General Long.

Do you think it would be appropriate before a

district judge ever grants a stay and -- and abeyance

procedure, to make some kind of a preliminary, not exactly

a probable cause determination, but some kind of a

23

determination as to whether or not there is arguable merit

to the State claim that he wants to stay the proceedings

to -- to allow him to exhaust?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERTO A. LANGE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. LANGE:

Yes, I do, Justice Stevens.

I

4

believe that a district court, in evaluating a request for

5

stay and abeyance, should look to make sure that the

6

petition meets the standards of section 2254(b)(2) which

7

is the provision that allows a district court to reach the

8

merits of unexhausted claims to deny them.

9

to what the Court has now promulgated as rule 4 of the

It's similar

10

rules governing habeas corpus cases.

11

sense for the district court first to look at -- at

12

whether there's merit to the petition because there really

13

is no sense to hold in abeyance, pending exhaustion in

14

State court, claims that lack merit.

15

I think it makes

Obviously, to get stay and abeyance, the

16

petitioner will have had to file timely within his AEDPA

17

period, and the court will have had to have held the case

18

either through the expiration of the AEDPA period or you

19

can imagine some scenarios where on the 364th day --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's one thing to say

21

that there's -- it's utterly without merit and he can deny

22

it, which he's entitled to do under the statute.

23

another thing to say that there's a high probability of

24

success on the merits.

doesn't know absent testimony, et cetera, et cetera.

2

MR. LANGE:

Right, and those should be

3

circumstances where the State court is left to judge

4

whether the claim has merit while the Federal court

5

proceedings are suspended, are abeyed or held in abeyance.

6

It makes sense, under the exhaustion norms of this Court,

7

to let the State courts pass judgment first on claims that

8

have sufficient merit where they can't be disposed of

9

under rule 4 of the rules governing habeas corpus.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. -- Mr. Lange, why -- why

11

isn't -- gee, you have Lange and Long.

This exhaustion rule is not to be an -- a trap

The whole purpose of

the exhaustion rule, as this Court said in Keeney v.

Tamayo-Reyes, is to -- not to erect a hurdle on the path

to Federal habeas court, but to channel claims into an

14
