ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN M. SHAPIRO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:

11

Judge Cudahy stated in his dissent in the

12

Seventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report in

13

this case should be required on both statutory and

14

constitutional grounds.

15

no item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's

16

decision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.

17
18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

21

Mr. Shapiro, can this case,

in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?

19
20

As Judge Cudahy put it, there is

MR. SHAPIRO:

Oh, yes, Your Honor.

We believe

it can.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

There also are due process

22

allegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what

23

the precise due process violation is that's alleged.

24

I would like you to address both and to tell us, first of

25

all, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis

But

1

from your perspective.

2

MR. SHAPIRO:

The readiest ground for decision

3

is the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is

4

a good means to avoid a complex due process question.

5

There are two statutes that are key here.

One

6

is the appellate review statute.

7

record statute.

8

reports of the Tax Court are public records, and we're

9

talking about a report of the Tax Court in this case.

10

The other is the public

The public record statute says all

The legislative history of that provision shows

11

Congress had the broadest possible intent to make all

12

practices in the Tax Court completely transparent.

13

steps in the adjudication were supposed to be -

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

All

Well, would that include -

15

if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law

16

clerk memos to the judge?

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

We -- we don't take that position.

It refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of a

19

trial judge who heard the witnesses.

There is only one rule 183 report.

20

Under the rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares

21

and submits to the chief judge at the completion of the

22

trial, which contains his independent credibility

23

findings.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do we know that?

Now -

now, what is the answer specifically in the statute?

that's the key question.

they're referring to?

MR. SHAPIRO:

And it really

Under rule 183(b) there is a

report denominated as such.

There's no question here it

If you look at page 114a of

the Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The docket here says

Can you make the argument that

-- maybe you can't -- that the special trial judge can go

17

to the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief

18

judge, and say, now, here's what -- kind of what I'm

19

thinking?

It's not my report, but here's what I'm

20

thinking.

And then the -- the Tax Court judge says, well,

21

why don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z?

22

He says, okay, and then he goes back.

argument that that first document is not the report?

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before

2

the report is submitted?

3

MR. SHAPIRO:

I -- I guess that's my question.
The rules are silent on that, but

4

Judge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the

5

report is submitted.

Dawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a

presumptive correctness standard.

8

surprising if there were consultation of that sort.

9

Then the case is assigned to Judge

So it would be

But what we contend is if there is consultation

10

behind the scenes about credibility determinations, then

11

it is critically important that the report be submitted

12

and made part of the record and not concealed, and that

13

the deferential standard of review be -

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would -- would that problem

15

be overcome if the special trial judge simply -- if his -

16

the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then

17

the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look

18

at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a

19

notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special

20

tax judge?

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

I suppose that's a possibility,

22

but in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like

23

that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate

24

demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great

25

deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of

3

the Raddatz problem that they now have.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, they -- they might, and Which currently requires that

8

the finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be

9

correct.

10

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct, and after all, we

11

should remember that the Government was supposed to

12

present clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this

13

case, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on

14

behind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what

15

could be more important to the reviewing court than to

16

know what had occurred at the first stage and the second

17

stage here?

18

no fraud, which we have reason to believe he did -- three

19

Tax Court judges stated that to us -- if that was -- that

20

was his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible,

21

then an unexplained overturning of that credibility

22

determination with no trace in the record would surely be

23

a candidate for reversal on appeal.

for that is to make the first report part of the record.

Well, we haven't challenged the

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1

is that a violation of the rule?

2

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I think the rule is silent

3

on that, but the spirit of the rule, frankly, is that the

4

STJ does his job.

5

it, and the reviewing judge examines it under a presumed-

6

correct standard in -- in the same orderly fashion that

7

ordinarily occurs when there is an initial judgment from a

8

-- from a trial judge about credibility with deferential

9

review that comes later.

10

He completes his report.

He submits

But the rule doesn't tell us much about these

11

consultations, and we do submit that if -- if they do take

12

place, as the Government suggests, there's importuning and

13

good reason for the overturning of these credibility

determinations.

And we -- we've seen that kind of review in the

19

Stone case in the D.C. Circuit, which is very similar to

20

this case.

21

the reviewing court, Judge Williams, found clear error

22

based on what the rule 183 report stated about witness

credibility.

court could use that to evaluate the judgment of the Tax

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, what you're asking

3

us to do would -- would just solve your problem in this

case, and -- and in the future, I suppose they could

5

revise rule 183 as simply not to require a report.

6

-- there's nothing in the statute that requires this

7

report, is there?

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, that's true.

There

They could

cease using the STJ's, but -

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, they could -- they could

11

use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll

12

consult with the -- with the deciding judge.

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

I -- I suppose that could happen.

14

If there is -- if there is no report written, we couldn't

15

contend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, and

16

that -- that might be.

17

But it -- there could be a Raddatz issue in that

18

scenario that you present, Justice Scalia.

because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings,

know, the Court reached out to the APA for guidance in

construing the labor laws.

Now, the Government says all of this changes the

2

course because the judge changed his mind, but you know,

3

there are so many opinions and orders and reports in the

4

Federal judicial system where a mind is changed and an

5

opinion is suppressed or -- or vacated or replaced and

that first opinion is still part of the record.

fallacy to say it's not part of the record just because

8

it's been abandoned.

9

It's a

For example, if I seek summary judgment in the

10

district court and it's denied and then I ask for

11

reconsideration and it's granted, the opinion has been

abandoned, but it's still part of the record.

13

if an appeal is taken, it's going to be exhibit A in any

it's just a logical fallacy to say that because somebody

Would the -- the Tax Court

MR. HUNGAR:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The central flaw in petitioners' case is that

10

both of the trial court judges responsible for evaluating

the evidence in the record reached the same conclusion

12

regarding all of the factual issues.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hungar, before you

14

proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the

15

Government is defending this practice because the

16

Government, after all, is on the other side of every case.

17

And aren't there situations where it might be that the

18

special trial judge would call a credibility question in

19

the Government's favor and then the Government loses the

20

case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know,

21

before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the

22

credibility findings were?

23

Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is

24

it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Hungar, do you -

Do you see somewhat of a

problem, that we are not dealing here with the

relationship between peers?

Court's grace.

And if you have compared in your brief

10

I think it's worlds different.

11

MR. HUNGAR:

Justice Ginsburg, Judge Dawson

12

actually is a senior judge who was recalled.

13

doesn't have the 15-year term protection.

14

So he

But it's true that special trial judges are -

15

are appointed by the chief judge, not by the Tax Court

16

judges, but by the chief judge, so that Judge Dawson

17

wasn't, in a sense, his -- his appointing, employing

18

official.

19

But more to the point, special -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He has had a special -- a -

21

a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax

22

Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the

23

court were appointed.

24

MR. HUNGAR:

25

Well, Judge Couvillion has been a

special trial judge, I think, for nearly 20 years.

15

The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a

MR. HUNGAR:

What's the

Well, one difference is that the

16

district court judges, as I understand it, appoint the

17

magistrate, not the chief judge.

18

But a more significant difference is that the

19

statute and rules applicable to magistrates require

20

disclosure of their reports and do not treat them as part

21

of the internal deliberative process.

22

determined that it is inefficient to have disclosure of

JUSTICE BREYER:

So where does it say that?

Where does it say that?

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They're not requiring the -

5

this case doesn't involve the question of whether they can

6

make objections to the finding in -- in the special

7

report.

8
9

It's just whether it's disclosed.
MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.

But the -- but

the Tax Court has determined not to disclose it.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, I understand.

But your

11

argument about how it would make the proceeding more

12

cumbersome, it seems to me, is -- is misplaced.

13

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, it certainly would be more

14

cumbersome if they followed the procedure that they used

15

to follow, which we submit, although the record is -- they

16

did not specifically state -

17
18
19

JUSTICE STEVENS:
that.

But they're not asking for

Am -- am I wrong on MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, that's true, Your Honor.

What

20

they're asking for here, what they say they want is merely

21

disclosure of the original report.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And it's a particularly strong

23

argument in a case -- in several of the issues.

24

remember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility

25

of oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the

I

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility

2

on one issue, if I remember correctly.

3

that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant

4

to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility

5

determinations were made by the person who heard the

6

witnesses.

7
8

MR. HUNGAR:

But the person who heard the

witnesses is Special Trial Judge Couvillion.

9
10

And it seems to me

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Has been convinced that he was

wrong.

11

MR. HUNGAR:

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
And the question is, well,

13

what was his -- what was the basis for his original

14

position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid

15

argument to make on appeal?

16

MR. HUNGAR:

Under that rationale, Justice

17

Stevens, every time a district court judge changes his

18

mind, after giving further thought to a case -

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. HUNGAR:

21
22

No, no, no.

-- before he issues his final

opinion JUSTICE STEVENS:

Only if he is required by a

23

rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed

24

report to someone else.

25

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, again, the -- the rule does

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

not preclude the practice.

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It is a common practice It doesn't forbid it.

You're

3

right.

4

wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair

5

way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know

6

what the basis for decision was and who thought what about

7

the witnesses and so forth?

It doesn't forbid it in so many words.

8
9

MR. HUNGAR:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But I just

If the -

in a -- when a -- when a court has a collegial

10

deliberative process involving more than one person that

11

is involved in the decision-making -- certainly this is an

12

unusual process in that -- and there is no identical

13

analog, but we see no due process problem.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No.

But I don't see what is

15

consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as

16

producing the report and the presumption of correctness in

17

the rule.

18

which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a

19

presumption of correctness, and I don't see the

20

consistency between provisionality and deliberate

21

character on the one hand and presumption on the other.

22

The rule presumes that some original document,

MR. HUNGAR:

If I may, Your Honor, the rule does

not state that the, quote, original report shall receive a

presumption of correctness.

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And aren't those findings of

4

fact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief

5

judge in the report that is made to the chief judge before

6

it is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?

7

MR. HUNGAR:

Not if -- not if the tax -- if the

8

special trial judge has abandoned those recommendations,

9

withdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But he hasn't abandoned them at

11

the point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if

12

that's what this is referring to, then the presumption of

13

the -- of -- of correctness necessarily has to apply to

14

whatever the document is that's delivered to the chief

15

judge.

16

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, it applies to the report, but

17

I submit that if the special trial judge withdraws in

18

order to correct an error in the report, what he submits

19

as the corrected report is then the, quote, report.

MR. HUNGAR:

The -- the credibility -- the due

regard and presumption of -

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MR. HUNGAR:

The presumption.

Well, it's important to understand

5

also that, in fact, it would violate the Internal Revenue

6

Code.

7

the Internal Revenue Code.

8

makes very clear, and this Court held in Freytag, that the

9

Tax Court judge, not the special trial judge, is the

This rule must be construed to be consistent with
The Internal Revenue Code

10

decision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds of

11

cases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute.

12

so held in Freytag and the -- and the statute makes that

13

very clear.

14

this, as petitioners do, to require some sort of

15

deferential clear error review.

So it would violate the statute to construe

1

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, but you're saying there is

2

-- there is no presumption of correctness that can operate

3

with respect to the report that goes first to the chief

4

judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would

5

violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-

6

finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge.

7

And therefore, I think the implication of what you're

8

saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.

9

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, presumption of

10

correctness does not necessarily equate with clear error,

11

deferential review.

12

That's my point.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm -- I'm not even getting to

13

whatever the standard of review may be.

14

word presumption means something other than it's there

15

unless you want to change it later after the person who

16

employs you objects to it.

17

more than that.

18

MR. HUNGAR:

I presume the

It's got to mean something

What the presumption of correctness

19

means in the tax context, with respect to deficiency

20

determinations and the like, is that the burden of going

21

forward is on the party seeking to change what -- what -

22

the determination that is presumed correct.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But there's no party who is

24

seeking to change at this point because the parties don't

25

know what's in it.

They're not going forward.

here.

there are two processes that go on.

report.

That's correct, because otherwise

it would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningful

limitation.

12

But again, it's important to understand here the

13

Tax Court judge did not exercise his authority in this

14

case to reverse or set aside the special trial judge's

15

findings.

16

He could have done so JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do they -- do they ever?

20

Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the

MR. HUNGAR:

number of cases from prior to the last rule change in

In addition, there are at least a

We're not aware of any cases in which the Tax

decide the case in the manner he or she thought -

expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that

20

whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference

21

between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in

combination with the special trial judge or without, would

say, action on the report -- action on the report, which

correcting, and resubmitting his report.

5

not compel that interpretation, and the Tax Court -

say anything about this consultation that you've

And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why

10

instead of being deceived by reading here is the special

11

trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do

12

is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?

13

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, I don't think it -- I mean, I

14

don't think it's -- it's deceitful, the -- the possibility

that a court -

Misleading.

Because when I

have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court

judge, and that judge does something with it, and that

something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject

22

MR. HUNGAR:

Your Honor, when the Tax Court

24

did not do so in as artful a manner as it could have.

the question is whether it violates the statute or due

2

Let me just -- we've been spending most of our

3

time talking about this issue of whether the Tax Court -

4

the special trial judge is permitted to change his report

5

under rule 183.

6

the questions presented.

7

the questions presented is whether the rule requires clear

8

error review.

9

it would violate the Internal Revenue Code.

That's not even one of the questions in
The only rule 183 question in

We submit the answer to that is no because
So this -

10

this question about whether the report permits -- whether

11

the rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one

12

of the questions presented.

13

The courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the

14

premise that it was permissible for the Tax Court judge

15

and the trial -- the special trial judge to engage in the

16

deliberative process and for the special trial judge to

17

revise his findings as he did --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I don't think there's any -

any question they can change the report, but the one -

20

the one -- I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of

information.

possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned

I don't know the answer to that,

seem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties

what the report they're arguing about would say.

MR. HUNGAR:

Again, I -- this is a holdover from

the prior version of the rule in which the exceptions

11

Tax Court given it further consideration, they might have

12

viewed that unnecessary.

happening.

assigned about whether or not to accept the report and

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, presumably it would be a

waste of everyone's time unless he -- I don't know that he

direct their attention to the issue he would like them to

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that the author

of this subsection (c) must have contemplated the

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, again, Your Honor, this

12

language was adopted at a time when they followed the

13

exception --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

When they followed a different

procedure, and the question is to how much -- how much did

they intend the -- to change that prior procedure.

Well, we know that the Tax Court

18

has interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice

it followed here because it said so.

quite extraordinary, we submit, for this Court to reverse

21

the Tax Court, which is surely entitled to considerable

22

deference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all,

the reason for that is that those are now internal

The Tax Court in 1984

The Tax Court said in its orders in this case

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Tax Court has made clear that

Mr. Hungar, you started to say

MR. HUNGAR:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.
How does that work?

Page 2a of the appendix to the gray

5

brief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) provides

6

that the report of the division -- and the Tax Court is

7

now and has for many years been divided into one-judge

8

divisions.

They used to sit en banc or -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I was -- I was going to ask you

what -- what 7461 referred to when it says the Tax Court

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

For a brief period of time, they

sat in -- in panels.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. HUNGAR:

It also is referred to there.

I see.

But they -- the -- the press of

work force them to -- to divide into one-judge divisions.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's a single judge is a

division of the Tax Court.

21

MR. HUNGAR:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, that's correct.
And the publicity of

23

proceedings does say -- it does say that all reports of

5

Well, what happens with -- with a single judge's
opinion?

MR. HUNGAR:

He -- he prepares it and submits it

7

to the chief judge under rule -- under statute -- under

the statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the

9

division shall become the report of the Tax Court within

10

30 days after such report by the division, unless the

11

chief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court.

12

So -- so even a Tax Court judge's opinion is not the

13

report of the Tax Court.

14

trial judge is not either.

15

Surely the report of the special

that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that

judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's

10

initial position was?

11

MR. HUNGAR:

The -- the Tax Court judge

12

certainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special

13

trial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation

14

under the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a

15

16

agree with the Tax Court judge's view, he has the

obligation, the ethical obligation -- and we presume he

follows it -- to say I don't agree.

This is my report.

Then he -- then he can

MR. HUNGAR:

No, but he can preclude the Tax

this case, which is simply adopting his report.

In the -- the one case involving a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how -- how often does the

4

court review decision?

5

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, there's often a dissent.

6

It's -- it's hard to know from the standpoint of a

7

researcher when -- when it is that the judge who heard the

8

evidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting,

9

unless they happen to say it in their opinion, because

10

again, there's no original opinion issued by the Tax Court

11

judge who first heard the case.

12

by statute, which again is an important point.

13

That's kept confidential

Congress has mandated confidentiality of the

14

initial reports prepared even by Tax Court judges, and it

15

has given the Tax Court plenary authority to promulgate

16

rules governing special trial judges.

17

surprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or

18

Due Process Clause, for the Tax Court to follow a similar

19

process for special trial judges.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It is hardly

Except that the -- the

21

relationship between the -- the one judge and the full Tax

Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the

23

same boat with respect to what they know about or can know

24

about law and what they can know about the evidence and

the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between
