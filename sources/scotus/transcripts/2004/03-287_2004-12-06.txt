ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. COLE:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

10

Prisoners typically want two things:

11

improve their conditions while in prison; and second, to

12

get out of prison as quickly as possible.

13

claims here are not conditions claims.

14

larger cell or better food while in prison.

15

claims are about getting out of prison.

16

first, to

Respondents'

They do not seek a
Rather, their

Traditional understandings of habeas would

17

suggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in

18

section 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms

19

that this common sense answer is also the correct answer.

20

In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which

21

independently prevent respondents from using section 1983

22

to pursue their claims here.

23

First, Heck establishes that civil actions under

24

section 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State

25

criminal judgments.

Before a prisoner can advance a claim

Washington, DC 20005

1

under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the

2

invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it

3

has been favorably terminated.

4

confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions

5

regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal

6

judgments for this purpose.

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And Edwards v. Balisok

Well, it isn't just duration of

8

-- of confinement.

9

was a determination that the confinement would be

I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had

10

definitely less as a result of the -- the good time

11

scheme.

12

what you were attacking would imply that the sentence

13

itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on.

14

The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that

We don't have that here.

What we have here is a

15

scheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more

16

definite sentence.

We know where in the range it's going

17

to be reconsidered.

And however that may be classified,

18

it's not simply a Balisok situation.

19

MR. COLE:

It's arguably different than the

20

good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as -- as Your Honor

21

notes.

22

respect to good-time credits, often under many State

23

systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving

24

up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially -

25

and in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on

However, I -- I would suggest that even with

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. COLE:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Right, but that had -

-- that had nothing to do with

5

the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it.

6

correct?

7

MR. COLE:

Isn't that

Your Honor, the -- the Court -

8

that's -- that's correct, yes.

9

I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court,

And I guess what I'd -

10

though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence;

11

that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim

12

threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement,

13

then that isn't a -- or that isn't a claim that should be

14

brought in 1983.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No -- no question.

But the

16

durational consequence in those cases was a definite

17

consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the

18

first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in

19

the second example.

20

consequence.

21

simply be a period of time before a sentence already

22

imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it

23

will be shortened or allowed to run.

24

different.

25

Here, there -- there is no such clear

Here, the consequence is that there will

MR. COLE:

And that's

I'm not sure it is, Your Honor.

Both

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of them are going to have definite durational consequences

2

for confinement.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No -- no question about that.

4

At -- at the level of whether there is a durational

5

consequence, they -- they both have it.

6

that.

7

MR. COLE:

I -- I grant you

And, Your Honor, as far back as

8

Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration

9

go to the very heart of habeas corpus.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's -

The duration of -- of the

11

sentence.

12

this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence

13

itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole

14

would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't

15

-- the determination of parole eligibility or parole

16

suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in

17

any way, shape, or manner.

18

And here, there's no implication at all that

MR. COLE:

Does it?

Well, a decision from a Federal court

19

-- and I guess -- I think the answer to Your -- Your

20

Honor's question is yes, it does.

21

that is I think we need to look to the consequences of the

22

Federal court decision that would follow from the claims

23

that -- that the plaintiffs -- or I'm sorry -- the

24

prisoners here are advancing.

25

And the reason I say

The State of Ohio has made individualized

decisions with respect to each of these respondents that

2

they should not again be considered for release from

3

prison until 2005.

4

requesting and the claims that they're bringing, if

5

successful, would result in the Federal court undermining

6

that State decision with regard to the length that they

7

should be incarcerated.

The request -- the relief that they're

It goes directly to the -- the -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It doesn't -- it doesn't

shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated.

10

There -- there is no certainty that -- that if they win

11

this action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser

12

period, is there?

13
14

MR. COLE:
Honor.

15
16

Absolutely no certainty of that, Your

But there is certainty JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and there was in the

other cases, wasn't there?

17

MR. COLE:

In Balisok.

Well, Your Honor, I don't think so.

18

I mean, prisoners could be released in the State of

19

Washington before the terminus of their sentence.

20

might not -- it isn't as though they had to serve all the

21

way till the end, less whatever good-time credits they

22

had.

They

They could easily be -

2

be released earlier.

3

earlier still, but their entitlement to be released

4

earlier was a consequence, wasn't it?

They might have been released even

be released earlier as a consequence of this.

MR. COLE:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And there is no entitlement to

We -You just get another hearing

and maybe you will, maybe you won't.

11

MR. COLE:

That's correct.

You'll -- you'll

12

just get another hearing.

13

you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing

14

sooner than the State has decided that you should get a

15

hearing.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But an important note on that:

Well, that's true.

So it makes

17

it possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- but

18

there's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucial

19

question for me, I think, is whether -- whether this could

have been brought as a habeas action.

21

been brought as a habeas action?

22

MR. COLE:

Could this have

Yes, Your Honor, it could have been

23

brought as a habeas action.

24

their complaints, they're -- they're clearly in custody.

25

Habeas would require custody and violation of the

If you look at the nature of

Constitution of the United States.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But they're just asking for a

3

new hearing.

4

What's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas

5

action which does not seek an earlier release but just -

6

just a hearing?

7

They're not asking for an earlier release.

MR. COLE:

I think probably the Garlotte case,

8

Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge

9

where the only result was going to be to advance the date

10

of eligibility for release from prison incarceration.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it -- it doesn't advance the

But it -- No, go on.

13

date of eligibility.

14

parole board will take another look.

15

is an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and

16

not an eligibility for release.

17

MR. COLE:

It advances the date at which the
The only eligibility

That's true, Your Honor, but these -

18

under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility

19

means the first possible release date.

20

prisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of

21

it's not going to happen for them unless and until the

22

next release hearing.

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But these

But if they are subject to

24

another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for

25

release.

And I think that's the point that we're getting

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- let me -- let me ask a -- a sort of complementary

2

question.

3

Is there any reason that these -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. COLE:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

With an I or an E?

7

JUSTICE SOUTER:

With an E.

Is this with an I or an E?

I was hoping for an I, yes.

With an E.

But if

8

-- if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I,

9

that's perfectly okay too.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. COLE:

12

I'll -- I'll wait and see what the

question is -

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

The -- the question is, could these claims not

15

have been brought in advance of any application to these

16

particular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were

17

-- the 1998 guidelines?

18

they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas

19

would -- would not have been a possible remedy.

20

-- am I correct on those two points?

21

MR. COLE:

Let's see what it is.

And if the answer is yes, then

Is -- is

The State concedes that if they had

22

brought this case before a parole hearing at which the

23

guidelines were applied, that it would be a different

24

case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that -- in that

25

situation.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here's -- here's the difficulty

2

that I -- that I have.

3

well, he must be right because this is really about

4

custody.

5

eventually.

6

When I read your brief, I thought,

It's really about custody.

They want to get out

But then when I -- I -- when I went back to

7

Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem.

8

is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok.

9

want the person to go into 1983 to get damages.

The problem

And normally you
But he's

10

going to get mixed up.

11

Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's

12

clear that habeas should have been brought.

13

he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth

14

Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't

15

got to habeas.

16

to habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it

17

was necessary to upset the conviction.

18

why that language is there.

19

When do you send him to habeas?

Don't go to habeas.

And so if

You didn't have to go

You see?

That's

Now, I got that far.

Then I said, oh, I see what you do.

We should

20

have one rule for damages.

21

there's no reason not to have a different rule when you

22

have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could

23

follow your rule.

Well, that makes sense.

But

24

But the next thing I come across is a statement

25

that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or

2

declaratory relief action.

3

write that?

4

trouble.

5

to make it too complicated and -- and not have all the

6

questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it

7

really, et cetera.

8
9

And I said, well, why did we

You know, we're the ones who caused all this

But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want

Okay.

So once I got that far, I said, oh, well,

I'm going to have to change something for you to win.

10

Either I have to change the thing that says the damages

11

should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change

12

something else somewhere along the line, the word

13

necessary.

14

Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really?

15

Because all that's important here is people know which way

16

they should go.

17

I don't want to change the word necessary.

Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking

18

give him his 1983 action.

19

Balisok.

20
21

It's simpler.

It follows from

Why not?
MR. COLE:

Well, Your Honor, there would be some

real consequences that would follow from that.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. COLE:

That's what I thought.

The reason that it's important that

24

these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of

25

the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

with habeas.

2

often, if not always, intricately bound up with State law

3

issues, and the State law is often going to provide much

4

more meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that

5

the prisoners advance.

6
7

Parole claims like those advanced here are

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Doesn't the Prison Litigation

Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?

8

MR. COLE:

Yes, but as Your Honor is aware,

9

that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this

10

Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially

11

lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by

12

habeas.

13

Moreover, it's telling -

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is -- may -- may I just follow

15

up on that question?

16

these State law policies perfectly well be taken into

17

consideration?

18

things are bound up with State law issues and the best

19

place to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum.

20

They can be resolved in a State administrative forum,

21

can't they?

22

At the administrative level, cannot

In other words, your argument was these

MR. COLE:

They could, Your Honor, but I -- I

23

think the types of legal determinations with respect to

24

legal entitlements and also the court -- we would assume a

25

State court would also consider Federal claims that might

Those types of legal claims are better resolved by

And in fact, in Ohio -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, couldn't one say the

6

same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a

7

1983 action?

8

prisons are operating and what changes would have to be

9

made.

The States know better about how their

So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that

10

the State knows more about how its parole system operates,

11

but so does it know more about how its prison system

12

operates.

13

whether you have 1983 or habeas.

14

And that doesn't -- that's not what determines

MR. COLE:

Well, but Congress, with respect to

15

conditions claims -- and if you look at the language of

16

the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at

17

42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought

18

with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without

19

administrative exhaustion.

20

about the PLRA and in thinking about requiring

21

administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really

22

about conditions of confinement.

23

never has been about -- release.

So even Congress, in thinking

1983 isn't about -- it

24

Habeas has traditionally been the relief that

people -- or the cause of action that people bring when

Well, no, I've got that part.

here I think because of the -- what we've written.

you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be

probably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison

Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the

injunctive/declaratory relief cases?

What do we change?

language there that talks about necessarily implying the

2

invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. COLE:

Oh, well.

-- respondents concede in their

5

brief, the only question then is does a parole decision

6

count as a, quote, criminal -

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

No, but then what

8

you're doing is taking the first half because what you're

9

reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever

10

those words were in Balisok that we were just talking

11

about, as your case satisfying that condition.

12

your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case

13

where a person wants to bring a damage action because of

14

illegally seized evidence at his trial.

15

mean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept -

16

then we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it

17

was trying to do.

18

MR. COLE:

And if

Doesn't it?

I

I don't think that's necessarily

19

right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence

at the trial -- I don't know that that would necessarily

imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from

22

that trial.

MR. COLE:

Right, Your Honor, and that -- that's

absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to

make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that

would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in

implication of success on that claim, and that's a -- a

distinction that the Court made both in Heck and in

brought them, but what are the claims.

12

here, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are

13

the ex post facto claims.

14

on their ex post facto claims -- and we don't believe

15

their claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on

16

those claims, there's no way the State's decision can

17

stand.

18

would again be considered for parole -

19

And the claims

If the -- if they have success

They are entitled to a new hearing at which they

MR. COLE:

We -- we concede that if there's an

ex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled

to a new parole hearing.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But they're not entitled to

invalidate the order that is at issue.

10

MR. COLE:

Well, the way that -- that I've been

11

thinking about it is if you put the State parole decision

12

up on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the

trumps the State decision.

They're entitled both to an immediate new release

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. COLE:

But not for release.

-- if they're successful on their

22

claims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings

23

in the future.

24
25

So the decision, the State's -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But -- but isn't it true that

one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had

18
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

refused to grant them parole?

2

MR. COLE:

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4

MR. COLE:

Absolutely.
And that remains.

It doesn't, Your Honor.

They have to

5

decide that again.

6

It's as though it were never entered.

7

new decision about whether or not this person should -

8

should have parole and that they cannot in any way -- the

9

State cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached

10
11
12
13

That -- that order is void ab initio.
They have to make a

on that issue.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

I thought the only relief they

were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.
MR. COLE:

No, they -- Dotson's complaint, I

14

believe at page 20 of the joint appendix -- he wants to,

15

quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole

16

hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and

17

administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed

18

his crimes.

19

They want an -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But aren't -- aren't those

20

claims moot or academic now?

21

he has had another parole hearing.

22

hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another.

23

he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or -

24

or flaws in the procedure at the hearing.

25

this case now reduces to a clean question about the

Because, as I understand it,

I thought that

1

retroactive application of the new guidelines.

2

MR. COLE:

Well, it isn't a clean question, Your

3

Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges

4

infected his first hearing was present at his second

5

hearing.

6

added to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have

7

the new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 2002

8

parole decision was predicated on exactly the same

9

guidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says

10
11

If -- if you look at the materials that they

violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause.
So, in fact, if anything, it's made his

12

situation worse because a Federal decision on his claims

13

now would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his

14

previous hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 2002

15

hearing was a release hearing.

16

that occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release

17

hearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both

18

that he should not get parole then and that he should not

19

again be considered for parole until 2005.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Unlike the halfway review

Was there -- maybe I'm wrong

21

about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to

22

the 2002 hearing.

23

MR. COLE:

But what Heck makes clear is it

24

doesn't matter what you say you're challenging.

25

need to look to is what's the necessary implication of

What we

1

securing success on your claims in Federal court for a

2

State decision.

3

they're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going

4

to be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 1999

5

decision -

6

Here, the necessary implication, if

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why can't it simply be that

7

prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old

8

guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing

9

anything that's happened in the past?

10

MR. COLE:

I think for the same reason that in

11

Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective

12

order that said -- said something like the method you have

13

for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and

14

deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that

15

method for selecting decision-makers.

16

have to change it on a going-forward basis would mean,

17

necessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and

18

deceit by the decision-maker that would mean that -

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Saying that you

I think twice you started

20

something and our questions impeded you.

21

were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal

22

sentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the

23

Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State

24

criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board

25

determination.

But I think you

And -- and I thought that the comparison

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

between a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and

2

sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination

3

-- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.

4

MR. COLE:

Not exactly on the same plane, Your

5

Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said

6

that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the

7

duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments

8

that are protected for purposes of -- of the Heck

9

doctrine.

10

And in Greenholtz, this Court JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but the -- the

11

generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect

12

to conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of

13

generality than anything that Balisok decided.

14

Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke

15

an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the

16

good time would give, and -- and that is a much more

17

specific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement

18

to be released.

19

to length of confinement.

20

In

It is not merely a decision with respect

MR. COLE:

Well, Your Honor, if this turns on

21

whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you

22

that it seems good-time credits might be different from an

23

entitlement sense than parole.

24
25

But -- but all the way back, in tracing the
cases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about

22
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

duration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue

2

that the decision here is going to have dramatic

3

consequences for the duration of these prisoners'

4

confinement.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We -- we don't know what

6

consequence it will have for the duration of his

confinement.

consequence in determining the date at which the next look

will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then

is in a condition to be released.
MR. COLE:

That's all we can tell.

That's correct, Your Honor, but

12

they're -- they're pressing ex post facto claims.

13

this point -- Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they

14

can maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency

15

of parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a

16

definite impact on the quantum of punishment that they

17

receive as a result of that change.

18

to be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're

19

going to have to show an impact on the duration of their

20

confinement.

21

because there's no durational impact on their -

22

And as

So if they're going

Either they have no ex post facto claim

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay.

But you're -- you're

23

assuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are

24

going to be successful on this element, that you say

25

they've got to satisfy later.

MR. COLE:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3
4

Right, but that's the Heck And -- and whether they are or

not has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.
MR. COLE:

I -- I disagree, Your Honor, because

5

in Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens

6

if they're successful on their claims.

7

the State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they're

8

going to be successful on these claims.

9

it's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they're

10

going to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it means

11

they're going to have to show, have to demonstrate a

12

durational impact on their sentence.

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure.

So I'm -- we're -

We don't agree

It also -- it also means

14

that if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if you

15

lose this case, you win the war.

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. COLE:

At -- at some level, I think there's

18

an -- an inherent and fundamental tension in their

19

position, and -- and the coin could flipped and conversely

20

there's that same tension in ours.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are -- are you sure that that's

22

what they have to prove, that -- a durational impact?

23

Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of

24

an opportunity to have the sentence shorter?

25

wouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto

Wouldn't -

violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they

2

lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?

3

MR. COLE:

But, Your Honor, I believe what makes

4

out the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum

5

of punishment after they've committed their crimes.

6

they need to show that as an element.

7

I -- I see -- I'd like to reserve the remainder

of my time for rebuttal, if I could.

here are correct.

MR. LEWIS:

We don't know that for sure, but

11

part of his claim as well is to say in future parole

12

hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you

13

don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that

14

I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, to the extent in his complaint

he was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the

challenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted

I don't think so.

I don't think

7

that Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because the

8

Federal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality of

9

custody, the legality of confinement, and that's not

10

anything that he's challenging in this case.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What would you do if there was

12

an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past

hearing?

14

read the wrong file or something, and it was just a

challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing.

MR. LEWIS:

Right.

And -- and I -- I think it

is still section 1983 if certain things are present.

24

is, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the

25

duration of his sentence by winning his case?

he can proceed in section 1983.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do we have any case in which

4

what was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a

5

habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but

6

the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was

7

determined?

8

MR. LEWIS:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't Is there any -- why -- why

10

shouldn't that be a habeas action?

11

limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always

12

-- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?

13

MR. LEWIS:

Why shouldn't 1983 be

Well, I think in the hypothetical

14

that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner

15

wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence

16

is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical

17

factor here.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, no, not necessarily.

12

MR. LEWIS:

So I've thought, well, if

Well, and I -- I think point with -

13

with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not

14

come into play because the prisoners must have gone

15

through and exhausted their State court remedies, and so

16

there wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their

claim in habeas.

That's correct.
Okay.

You would basically end up going to

a Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for

processes to be changed prospectively.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that's why they could not

bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still

would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get

affecting the sentence if you win your case.

rules to him so that he'll be eligible.

Under these guidelines, he'll

22

he will be entitled to annual parole release hearings, and

23

the new rules say that the State can postpone those

24

hearings for up until 10 years.

25

Again, it's

cases that have been brought, as I say, for the last 30

And I think this case is very

impact on the duration of the prisoner's sentence by -- by

is very, very speculative.

Whereas, here, the impact

Justice Souter, you referred earlier to a

17

is really quite hypothetical and remote.

18

on his 1983 claims, all he will be entitled to are future

hearings, and since parole is entirely discretionary in

20

Ohio, we can't predict the outcome of those proceedings.

He'll also be entitled to -- merely to be considered

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS R. COLE

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. COLE:

14

A number of points.

Thank you, Your Honor.
I wanted to start by

15

responding to Justice Souter's question, which was again

16

asking about this need for entitlement to early release

17

as part of habeas, and would ask the Court to consider the

18

In re Braden case where a prisoner in Alabama was seeking

19

to challenge a detainer that had been issued by Kentucky.

20

And the basis for the challenge to the detainer in habeas

21

was the fact that it was having implications for his

22

parole eligibility in Alabama.

23

going to be necessarily an entitlement to earlier release,

24

but simply a difference in the parole considerations.

25

So there, there was not

Second, Justice O'Connor, with respect to your

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

questions about mootness, the only point that I would add

2

is that if this case is moot now, it was moot when the

3

Sixth Circuit decided it as well.

4

direction we're going, I think there need to be a decision

5

vacating the judgment below -

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what's your position as

7

to whether or not it's moot?

8

MR. COLE:

9

So if mootness is the

Your Honor, we don't believe it's

moot either, and in -- in fact, for two reasons.

First,

10

once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing

11

decision, albeit it not the one that was originally

12

threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but

13

there is a new one where that would have that consequence.

14

In terms of bad consequences, I think the single

15

biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to

16

1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of

17

the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts.

18

The Layne decision in the last -- decided just 2 years

19

ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action

20

about the way parole works in Ohio.

21

and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving -

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They were successful

But -- but you raise

23

deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio

24

courts.

25

brought a 1983 action in State courts.

If they wanted that benefit, they could have
State courts have

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdiction.

2

they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling

3

you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.

4

So it's a little odd for you to say, oh,

MR. COLE:

That's true, Your Honor.

At the same

5

time, this -- bringing this -- this case in 1983 in

6

Federal court means that they're not going to be able to

7

get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst

8

doctrine.

9

get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are

10
11

So they are depriving themselves of a chance to

offering and that courts in other States are offering.
The other -- the other point I wanted to make is

12

that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his

13

understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the

14

sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole

15

revocations can't be in habeas either.

16

-- when you're on parole, you're still serving part of

17

your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial

18

MR. COLE:

Well, but to the extent we're

The custody you've been

sentenced to?
MR. COLE:

But to the extent we're talking about

duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the

claims here do have a -- success on the claims here would

have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement.

10

This Court in Muhammad said -- I think this is probably

the -- the closest quote on point -- challenges to

12

particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the

13

province of habeas corpus.

14

This is a challenge to a particular, the parole

procedures, that's affecting the duration of their

confinement.

17

that's what success on their claims is going to mean.

because of those durational consequences, as well as

because of the consequences of success on the merits for

I think we can follow that case as

it's been reinterpreted in Heck.

Heck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not

-- and I believe the language is -- necessarily vitiate

the underlying decision.

was that the procedural challenges there, with regard to

7

the prospective relief they were seeking, were not the

type of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision

Wolff said that -- well,

Here, by contrast, the claims that they're
