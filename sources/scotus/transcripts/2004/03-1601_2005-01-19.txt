ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. LAMKEN:

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

May it

please the Court:
This case concerns whether Congress, in enacting

11

section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act, intended to

12

expose local governments and State and local officials to

13

expansive section 1983 liability with the tens of

14

thousands of wireless antenna zoning decisions they must

15

make each year.

16

Entitled preservation of local zoning authority,

17

section 332 provides for State and local agencies in the

18

first instance to implement specific Federal substantive

19

and procedural requirements, together with preserved State

20

zoning laws, in passing on applications to build or modify

21

wireless towers.

22

independent cause of action for accelerated judicial

23

review of the decisions, including a short limitations

24

period and mandatory expedition.

25

sufficiently comprehensive to evidence Congress' intent

It then provides a highly distinctive,

That tailored process is

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

for enforcement to occur --

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as

3

comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on

4

that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of

5

action, is it?

6

I mean, it's -- it's more spare.

MR. LAMKEN:

It -- it is unusual in its unique

7

focus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for

8

the focus on private enforcement.

9

the Communications Act, the Congress chose -- for example,

In other provisions of

10

section 253, Congress chose to eliminate enforcement at --

11

at the FCC level because it was concerned that State and

12

local governments often wouldn't have enough -- excuse me

13

-- local governments in particular --

14

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

15

MR. LAMKEN:

16

Well, what -- what --

-- wouldn't be able to -- I'm

sorry.

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What would you think of a

18

case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning

19

was the -- was caused by racial discrimination against the

20

applicant?

21

suppose?

22

Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you

MR. LAMKEN:

Yes.

That would still be available

23

because the -- the section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) only provides

24

for a cause of action for violations of the Communications

25

Act.

Violations of the Constitution continue to be

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

enforceable directly under section 1983.

2

Section -- section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) is

3

comprehensive in the relevant sense in that for every

4

violation of section 332(c)(7), for every person adversely

5

aggrieved, it provides a mechanism for private judicial

6

enforcement.

7

In addition --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what about -- it -- it

8

-- section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate

9

relief.

What does that include?

10

punitive damages?

11

you think?

12

Could it include

Could it include attorney's fees, do

MR. LAMKEN:

In that respect, it is

13

indistinguishable -- for example, the statute that was at

14

issue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the

15

precise forms of relief available.

16

case, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the

17

type of relief that is traditionally given on review of

18

zoning decisions and on review of judicial review of

19

agency action.

20

considerations.

21

In our view in this

That's supported by a number of

I should point out, in the first instance, that

22

in this case respondent never did seek damages, or

23

punitive damages for that matter, under section

24

332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself.

25

But that's supported by a number of

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

considerations.

2

First is the structure of the act, which

3

presents it as a form of judicial review of agency action.

4

The act is structured much as you have -- much as you

5

would when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal

6

requirements and are subject to judicial review.

7

difference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State

8

and local agencies with the initial implementers in place

9

of the Federal Government.

The only

In that respect, it shares

10

some of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the

11

Communications Act which are also implemented by local --

12

by -- excuse me -- by State governments as opposed to the

13

FCC.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. -- Mr. Lamken, the

15

argument has been made that 4 years before the

16

telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted,

17

Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act.

18

And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to

19

declaratory and injunctive relief.

20

Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit

21

relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in

22

the -- in the measure?

23

MR. LAMKEN:

Here we face silence.

Justice Ginsburg, that -- that's an

24

example where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that

25

could be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to restrict the forms of relief available.

2

example, in the words of Sea Clammers, where Congress has

3

made its intent explicit in the text of the statute.

4

And it is an

Congress can also by implication limit the forms

5

of -- excuse me -- limit the mechanism for relief that's

6

available, and that's our position here, that Congress by

7

providing --

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What's the -- what's the source

of the implication?

10

MR. LAMKEN:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

MR. LAMKEN:

Pardon?
You say by implication.

The implication -- Congress has

13

provided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here,

14

section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly

15

adapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics

16

such as a very short limitations period.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so the -- the

18

implication, I -- I guess, is that unless it specifically

19

provides for damages, it implicitly does not.

20

MR. LAMKEN:

I'm sorry.

In terms of Congress

21

making damages available under 332(c)(7)(B)(v), our view

22

of the damage -- mind you damages are only one of the

23

differences we think that exists here, but our view is

24

supported by a number of considerations, in addition to

25

the structure of the statute.

For example, appropriate

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

relief is often -- is the traditional form of relief

2

available.

specific relief.

savings clause that extends not merely to Federal

5

statutes, but prohibits the impairment --

In this context traditional relief was always
Congress also included a specific

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Where -- where are

you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?
MR. LAMKEN:

This -- that comes from this

Court's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't

10

specifically identify the specific forms of relief

11

available --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

But that's --

13

that's not in the -- that's not in the text of this

14

statute, is it?

15

MR. LAMKEN:

No, it isn't.

It is an inference

16

the Court draws from silence.

17

Congress provides an express cause of action and does not

18

identify the specific forms of relief available, the Court

19

will infer that Congress intended to provide all

20

appropriate relief.

21

that relief which Congress would have intended, and when

22

the Court is determining that, it takes a look at what the

23

traditional forms of relief are and it will look at things

24

such as the savings clause in 601(c), which expressly says

25

that the statute should not be read, unless it expressly

When the Court -- when

But the term, appropriate relief, is

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

provides, to supersede, impair, or otherwise modify State

2

and local law, as well as Federal law.

3

put damages into the statute, if it doesn't provide

4

damages expressly, one would have to impair myriad

5

municipal immunity laws that otherwise protect

6

municipalities and State and local officers implementing

7

zoning requirements from liability.

8

Finally, the FCC has --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10
11

And in order to

And -- and 1983 is not subject

to that limitation.
MR. LAMKEN:

Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive

12

under this Court's decisions, and it is -- it would

13

preempt the State laws by its own force.

14

that that also supports Congress' decision not to provide

15

-- or supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend

16

to provide section 1983 relief here because the effect of

17

making the Communications Act enforceable under section

18

1983 would be to expand the categories of claims for which

19

-- that -- those immunities are unavailable, and it would

20

thereby impair those immunities.

21
22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But we believe

But are they only immune from

damages action or are they immune from suit?
MR. LAMKEN:

No.

They're generally immunities

-- immune from damages actions, not from suits.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So, I mean, that proves too

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

much because they -- the statute obviously intends to

2

eliminate that immunity.

3

clearly --

4

MR. LAMKEN:

The immunity from suit is -- is

misunderstood.

MR. LAMKEN:

As a constitutional matter, they

have an immunity from suit, but -JUSTICE SCALIA:

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you have to regard this

2

provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of

3

State law in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.

4

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, first of all, I don't think

5

it would be read to -- to override the State's

6

constitutional immunity to suit.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. LAMKEN:

9
10

That's --

But it would be read to -- it would

be read to override immunities to suit that exist under
State law because otherwise it couldn't be affected.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

MR. LAMKEN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

No.

In for a penny, in for a pound.

Right.
If they've -- if they've

waived --

15

MR. LAMKEN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But I'm not -If -- if you acknowledge that

17

it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why --

18

why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect

19

their immunity from damages?

20

MR. LAMKEN:

Well, because it would be -- it

21

would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it

22

didn't override immunities to suit.

23

But I'm not sure there are provisions that are

24

providing for -- I mean, that there are myriad damages

25

immunity laws that provide municipalities absolute

immunity from suit.

2

California and other State law, for municipalities to be

3

subject to suit for review of their -- of the actions that

4

they make.

5

this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of

6

providing judicial review of agency action.

7

It's fairly common, at least under

And that is the typical fashion that this --

Another consideration that supports the view

that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act

It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA-

mechanism for judicial review.

much like the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson.

In that sense, it is very

That elaborate process is particularly

significant given the pattern of the Communications Act as

a whole.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would a State court be free to

13

award damages or would that be preempted under the view

14

you take of the statute?

15

MR. LAMKEN:

The State -- because there's an

16

express preservation of State law in this context, I think

17

that State -- States would be free to award damages under

18

their own laws.

19

available under the Federal statute would be available

20

under the available under the Federal statute, and State

21

courts wouldn't be free to second-guess Congress' judgment

22

as to what relief should be provided under Federal

23

statute.

24
25

They wouldn't -- whatever relief is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the State court allowed

damages -- if -- if the State system allowed -- State law

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action

2

under this section, be allowed to award damages under that

3

-- under the State statute?

4

MR. LAMKEN:

Your Honor, I think since the --

5

the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute

6

should not be construed to impair State law -- and there

7

are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only

8

have one construction of the statute -- I believe that the

9

construction would be an across-the-boards construction,

10

that this act does not provide damages and you would not

11

vary from State to State.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?

21

recovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then

of Federal law, the -- the remedies that Congress chose to

provide would control and the States would not be

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure why that would be

helps your position.

position.

20

normal view would be that where Congress provides a -- a

statute, one would normally presume that Congress intended

say that the silence is meant to -- meant to reflect the

That appeal is then reviewed -- is then determined.

2

finally, once you've gone through that process, under

3

California law it's generally reviewable by a writ of

4

mandate, although other -- other States provide review by

5

writ of certiorari, by mandamus, or by various other

6

procedures, almost always subject to a short limitations

period, almost always short -- requiring finality, a final

decision, exhaustion through the State process.

12

Generally they have the authority to effectively go in and

13

revise the decision below, but the remedies ordinarily do

14

not include monetary or compensatory relief I should say.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you saying that it's

16

parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would

17

be?

18

MR. LAMKEN:

It's very much like that.

The

19

remand rule that this Court normally requires in the APA

20

context is not so strictly observed in the context of --

21

of review of -- judicial review of zoning decisions, but

22

it is very much like APA review.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That is what prevails.

It -- it seems to me that the

24

30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of

25

damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why.

Well, actually this Court's

3

decision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and

4

that is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-

5

the-record review of decisions below, are often

6

insufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new

7

record such as their proof of damages, to make important

8

decisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury

9

trial, or to prepare for discovery.

And that's why 30-

10

day provisions are not entirely uncommon in the area of

11

judicial review of agency action, but they're wholly

12

unprecedented, for the most part that I know of, in the

13

area of tort-like remedies like section 1983.

14

If I -- if there are no further questions, I

15

would like to reserve the remainder of my time for

16

rebuttal.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

Mr. Feldman.

Yes, you may.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

20

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

21

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

22
23
24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
Where Congress creates a special cause of action
for -- for a violation of a Federal law that necessarily

18
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

carries with it its own features and incidents, Congress'

2

decisions about the appropriate mechanisms for dealing

3

with that violation of Federal law should not be

4

frustrated or overridden by allowing a 1983 action in

5

addition.

6

In this case, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which

7

creates a cause of action for violation of the specific

8

standards in (i) through (iv) is an independent,

9

standalone cause of action.

If 1983 didn't exist,

10

332(c)(7)(B)(v) would, undoubtedly, still provide

11

plaintiffs with a mechanism to get into court and attain

12

redress for the legal wrongs that they claim.

13

Where Congress has taken that step and has

14

thought about what the appropriate remedy should be for a

15

violation of a particular Federal statute and has created

16

a judicial remedy, then it would only frustrate --

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But it -- the statute,

18

though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's

19

fees, isn't it?

20

MR. FELDMAN:

It is.

It doesn't say anything

21

expressly about either of those things, but I think it has

22

long been --

23
24
25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
relief?

Can we infer all appropriate

Do we?
MR. FELDMAN:

As a matter of damages, I think

19
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

all appropriate relief would be the standard.

2

matter of attorney's fees, I think is a good example of

3

why there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law

4

is 100 percent clear, from this Court's decision in

5

Alyeska and other cases, that where Congress hasn't

6

provided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting

7

authorized.

8
9

That's what they intended.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Attorney's fees are never

appropriate, in other words.

10
11

But as a

MR. FELDMAN:

Are never appropriate unless

Congress specifically provides for them.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But it has provided for them

13

for a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes

14

care of it.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.
And this is kind of circular.

I don't think it's circular

18

because I think when Congress created the specific cause

19

of action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's

20

fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be

21

provided.

22

accepted, the -- the presumption would be exactly flipped,

23

and Congress would have had --

If respondent's view in this case were

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Feldman -Suppose Congress said

20
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

specifically 1983 applies.

2

that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?

3
4

MR. FELDMAN:

That's all it says.

Would

Yes, I -- yes, I think it -- I

think it would.

5

The question here, though, is where Congress has

6

thought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation

7

of a Federal statute and created a judicial cause of

8

action for every wrong that's -- that -- that can exist

9

under that statute, then the incidents and features of

10

that cause of action should govern, not the incidents and

11

features of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case

12

are different.

13

example of that.

14

And attorney's fees is just the best

If -- under respondent's view -- when Congress

15

was fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of

16

this Court's decisions that have repeatedly said that

17

attorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly

18

provided for.

19

Act --

20

And indeed, elsewhere in the Communications

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I take -- you -- you

21

take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all.

22

not just attorney's fees.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

It's

It's damages.

That's right.

But it's just an

24

illustration.

25

provision here and 1983, but I think the basic point is

There's other differences between the

21
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that where Congress has given thought to the remedy for a

2

particular violation -- type of violation of Federal law

3

and has provided for a judicial cause of action, with

4

whatever features and incidents it -- it wants, 1983

5

shouldn't be allowed in.

6

Congress didn't want to have its decisions frustrated by

7

also allowing a 1983 action.

It should be assumed that

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What about damages?
Do you -- do you think that

10

any other provisions of the Communications Act are

11

enforceable under 1983?

12

but it's a big, complicated act.

13

provisions enforceable?

14

MR. FELDMAN:

I mean, we're talking about 332,
Are any of the other

I think -- I think the same rule

15

would apply to any of the provisions where Congress has

16

specifically provided for a cause of action for the same

17

reason, otherwise Congress when -- here, for example, just

18

to return to attorney's fees for a second.

19

was framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't

20

giving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would be

21

construed not to give attorney's fees, but not --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

When Congress

Well, this is really a more

23

general proposition you're urging upon us then, that

24

whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is --

25

what -- in any respect more limited than section 1983, the

22
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

background action of section 1983 is not available.

2
3

MR. FELDMAN:

That -- I -- I think that's

correct.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

How could that be?

5

Wouldn't it depend on whether -- when you look at the

6

particular statute, the particular set of remedies that

7

Congress has included in that statute could be absolutely

8

independent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in

9

favor or leaning against.

10

particular statute.

11

It would depend on the

Why in general?

MR. FELDMAN:

I think in -- I think the rule

12

would be in general because, first of all, it's not just

13

remedies.

14

such as statute of limitations, the provision here for

15

expedition, and other things.

16

has given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation

17

here of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the

18

Communications Act of other Federal standards, it

19

shouldn't be assumed that they all -- that -- to allow a

20

1983 action would just frustrate Congress' intent in

21

fashioning that particular remedy.

22

There's other incidents of a cause of action

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And really when Congress

Then how would you ever have

23

a statute that -- 1983 provides for relief when there's a

24

violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional.

25

One of the briefs in this very case says that your broad

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reading means that you were doing away with statute as a

2

basis for 1983.

3

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I think that that's

4

completely wrong.

5

recognized a right, as this Court has found is essential

6

for a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about

7

providing a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause

8

of action in court in particular, then that's the function

9

of 1983, is to serve -- it provides a cause of action for

When Congress has created -- has

10

people who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory

11

violation.

12

But where Congress has given thought to what

13

kind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of

14

action with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's

15

fees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever

16

the other ones are here, then it would just frustrate

17

Congress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983

18

action to undo all of the things that Congress provided

19

for.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, there -- there are two

21

situations.

22

frustrating.

23

know -- in some respects the 1983 will contradict the

24

action that was provided, but one can conceive of a

25

provided action that -- that grants relief which 1983

I mean, one can supplement without
I mean, you -- you could say that in, you

24
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

would not grant.
MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

And -- and I --

3

whatever -- I guess the general point would be whatever

4

remedial decisions Congress made, those should be

5

respected, but I would add in this case it's not just --

6

it's a question of attorney's fees, which they would have

7

had to -- Congress would have had to do something very

8

unusual here, which is particularly put in this statute no

9

-- there shall be no fee-shifting because otherwise you

10

can always go to 1983 and get it.

11

had done that in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), respondents would still

12

argue, well, we still have our 1983 action.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In fact, even if they

What -- what about damages?

Do

14

-- do you take any position on whether the Communications

15

Act provision enables damages to be collected?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

17

whether it does.

18

would point out --

19
20
21

We don't have a position on

I think there's arguments both ways.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

You think it's unnecessary to

decide this case.
MR. FELDMAN:

I think it is unnecessary, and in

22

fact, I think it shows a problem with -- a reason why our

23

view, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that

24

should be respected -- why that should be respected.

25

Under other views, you have to look at the 1983

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

action and figure out all of its incidents.

2

look at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents

3

in the abstract as here, not where -- in connection with a

4

particular claim for damages, and then see whether they're

5

consistent with each other.

You have to

6

I think the much better rule would be to say

7

where Congress has created a specific cause of action,

8

that's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that,

9

you get.

Whatever you don't get under that, you don't

10

get.

11

Congress' intent and give you things that that cause of

12

action wouldn't to give you a longer statute of

13

limitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to

14

give you -- eliminate the provision for mandatory

15

expedition, to have any differences in damages.

16

But 1983 shouldn't be used to -- to frustrate

Another way to put it would be under the Court's

17

decision in Franklin, this statute gives you any

18

appropriate relief.

19

maybe gives you the same thing in which, as far as that

20

goes, it doesn't matter.

21

would be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that

22

Congress didn't want.

23

All that 1983 could do here -- it

But all it could do otherwise

And instead of construing the two statutes in

24

that way, they should be construed harmoniously and in

25

accord with this Court's decisions which have set forth

26
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the line of cases where you have a right to get into court

2

in Wilder -- I'm sorry -- in -- in Sea Clammers and Smith

3

against Robinson and said there we want to take Congress'

4

remedy, however simple or complex it is.

5

complete right to get into court and gives you whatever it

6

gives you.

7

It gives you a

And that should govern.

And then the other line of cases, which is

8

Wilder where -- and -- where it says -- and the Wright

9

against Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to

10

get to court -- get into court.

11

the function of 1983.

12

In those cases, that's

The same thing would be true in -- in a number

13

of other this Court's cases that have recognized you have

14

a 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't

15

think at all about the remedy because that's the function

16

that 1983 was supposed to serve.

If there's no further questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:

24

In -- by its clear text, section 1983 promises

25

redress for the depravation of any Federal right in any,

27
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

quote, proper proceeding.

2

this Court has recognized, dictates a heavy presumption

3

that its remedies apply to all violations of Federal

4

rights, a presumption which this Court has said is

5

rebutted only in the, quote, exceptional case in which the

6

statute that creates the right is accompanied by an

7

enforcement scheme that is, quote, incompatible with or

8

inconsistent with 1983's remedies.

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And that expansive language,

That's --

Mr. Waxman.

-- the background principle.
Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that

12

the -- the best argument we've heard about incompatibility

13

is the one -- or at least I think the best -- is the one

14

that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his

15

argument, and that is, he said there's -- there's a 30-

16

day provision in there, which in effect says Congress

17

wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast.

18

And that is incompatible with a damage action because if

19

you get into a damage action, you are going to get into

20

the panoply of -- of damages litigation, including

21

depositions, and -- and the one thing you can guarantee is

22

that it is not going to be over expeditiously.

23

What is your argument?

24

that incompatibility argument?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

What is your response to

Well, I think that the way this

28
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court has interpreted incompatibility before -- in the two

2

instances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was

3

decided, the only instances in which this Court has found

4

incompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an

5

end run around limitations in the statute.

6

the -- in Sea Clammers and in Smith v. Robinson, you had

7

statutes that forestalled an individual's access to court

8

via an administrative regime and then expressly limited

9

the judicial remedies that would be available once they

That is, in

10

got there by requiring, for example, only injunctive

11

relief.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the other word is

13

inconsistent, and is it -- sorry.

14

inconsistent if Congress didn't want it?

15

insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at

16

the statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it

17

sounds like an administrative law statute.

18

maintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty

19

statute.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Were you -- is it
And if that's

If I saw the

I --

I see an administrative law

22

statute.

23

imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent

24

with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to

25

fail.

It sounds like that's the system they're

29
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

Now I have two points.

I --

2

I don't want to forget these.

3

the question of whether a 30-day requirement is

4

inconsistent and whether damages would be inconsistent

5

with what -- with what my colleagues posit as an APA-like

6

administrative review model.

I have to deal with the --

7

A 30-day requirement is simply a reflection of

8

Congress' -- Congress confirming expressly that somebody

9

who -- who is aggrieved under the rights provided to him

10

under 332(c)(7) and wants any judicial remedy, whether

11

it's from 1983 or otherwise, has to go to court promptly.

12

It's precisely what 1983, this Court said in Patsy and

13

Felder, guarantees and requires.

14
15
16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It does not require --

But it also requires

expeditiousness on the part of the court.
MR. WAXMAN:

It requires that the court proceed

17

expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where

18

damages are sought or are not sought.

19

One of the interesting things about damages --

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But do you -- do you agree with

21

this much, that if -- if damages, in fact, are going to be

22

allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to

23

be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious

24

if damages are not allowed.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

I don't think that's true.

In

30
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

fact, I think this case is a pretty good example.

2

court separated it -- I mean, acting under a requirement

3

of expedition at the request of the city.

4

court didn't even begin to address this case until 18

5

months after it had been filed.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

Okay.

The

This -- the

But what it said was -And -- and that --

-- the first issue --- that was a violation of the

statute, wasn't it?

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it first issued an order

11

saying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've

12

determined that the statute is violated.

13

a separate proceeding.

14

accordingly.

15

order to determine whether damages or attorney's fees are

16

available.

17

What --

18

Now we will have

Then the city will conduct itself

Now we'll have a separate proceeding in

And that is available in any of these cases.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So they turned the damage issue

19

basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end

20

of the case.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

It could or could not be, and there

22

may -- may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate

23

but --

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that was just to

decide in -- in the -- in the court of first instance --

31
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific

2

case damages or attorney's fees were due.

3

district court was deciding a question of law, that is,

4

whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could

5

have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

But the

What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was

7

we'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available

8

and to what extent in a separate proceeding.

9

out, he concluded in an --

10
11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
this case only.

12

As it turns

But was not making a rule for

He was making a ruling of law.

MR. WAXMAN:

For sure.

He said that I don't

13

think you're entitled to this because I think that the

14

statute doesn't allow it.

15

this question.

16
17

And therefore, he didn't get to

But the point about damages -- I think there are
two points that are very important that not be obscured.

18

First of all, the Government -- the fact that

19

the Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether

20

the statute itself provides damages relief under the

21

principle of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County

22

certainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on

23

this subject.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
disagree.

They -- they don't necessarily

The Government just says the -- the issue

32
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

doesn't have to be reached in this case.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think -- I think that --

3

what the Government says in its papers is they may well be

4

available and what Mr. Feldman -- I don't want to misquote

5

him, but he said that under Franklin -- he agreed, I

6

think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh

7

Circuit, which is where no remedies -- where no specific

8

remedies are specified -- and that's the case here -- you

9

apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v.

10

Hood and applied to an implied right of action in

11

Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is

12

available.

And damages are the paradigm.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Waxman.

And the irony here -Mr. Waxman, how do you -- how

16

do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is

17

applicable to the cause of action under the Communications

18

Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983?

19

I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983.

20

There's no 30-day limit there.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22
23

I have -- I have two different ways

to get to that.
First of all, section 1983, by its terms,

24

provides redress in any appropriate cause of action.

25

also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of

action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't

2

exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that

3

are brought under 1983.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, it doesn't.

But more broadly -It doesn't require you to --

7

to establish a cause of action under some other statute

8

either.

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

That's right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It provides a --

It does not at all.

It's --

11

it's self-contained.

12

have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to

13

read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from

14

the statute that was violated and which forms the basis

15

for the 1983 action?

16

MR. WAXMAN:

And do you know any case where we

Well, I don't, but I do know that

17

this Court -- first of all, Congress has now enacted

18

section 1658 which provides a -- a 4-year Federal default

19

statute of limitations, where -- where a statute like 1983

20

doesn't provide it, but includes an -- an introduction

21

that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law.

22

And there's certainly nothing in that language that says

23

when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is

24

otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very

25

statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is

34
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

2

enforcing.
And even before that, when your -- your decision

3

in Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to

4

figure out what statute of limitations applies to a

5

freestanding 1983 action, there are -- there is a

6

tripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires

7

you to engage in.

8

there is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of

9

limitations.

10

And the first part is to see whether

Now, in constitutional cases, like the one that

11

was at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social

12

Security Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v.

13

Thiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much

14

less any express statute of limitations.

15

Court said you then go to the second rule, which is what's

16

the most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires.

17

But the anomaly of the argument here is we have

And so this

18

a background principle that 1983 is available and there is

19

a heavy presumption that it will be available unless it is

20

explicitly incompatible or inconsistent with --

MR. WAXMAN:

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, when Congress

addressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

out in the very first page of its brief and as the

2

legislative history reflects, it was confronting a

3

situation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning

4

authorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the

5

creation of a national wireless network.

6

concerned about this that the House actually passed a

7

provision that removed this paradigmatic local authority

8

to the FCC.

9

The FCC was --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

burdensome?

11

12

burdensome on federalism --

Which would be more intrusive and

I think --- and the abilities of local

governments to function?
MR. WAXMAN:

Oh, I think the former, for sure.

17

I mean, the notion that zoning decisions, siting decisions

18

would be removed entirely from localities is unbelievably

19

intrusive.

20

And what happened in the conference committee

21

was a compromise was reached whereby Congress' objective

22

was going to be achieved by creating -- by leaving it, in

23

the first instance, Justice Kennedy, to local --

17

inattentive to State and local budgets.

do what was this -- the point this Court the addressed in

19

-- in Stakura and -- and Owens v. City of Indianapolis,

20

which is to enforce a Federal statute through privately

21

enforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages

22

remedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that

23

had provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program

24

and provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate.

25

What it wanted to

Now, this Court has made clear, with respect to

Washington, DC 20005

1

damages, in -- in Carey v. Piphus and other cases, that

MR. WAXMAN:

But with respect to --

If I may just finish this sentence.

7

And in Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, this Court has --

have to have substantially prevailed and a court, under

in its discretion insofar as they are reasonable.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And --

Mr. -- Mr. Waxman.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
There is in this legislative

15

record a concern expressed by a Senator from California

16

when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the

17

Federal review forum.

18

understand correctly, because there was a concern that

19

municipalities would have to travel all the way to

20

Washington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum.

21

Congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the

22

cost of transporting their representative to D.C.

23

that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that

24

would be awarded.

25

MR. WAXMAN:

And that was rejected, if I

-- the reference to those two Senators -- what those two

5

section 253, but I may be wrong.

6

They were talking about
I think it was

But even if that's the case, the fact of the

7

matter is that whether it was going to cost them -- I

8

agree.

9

all of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking,

It would cost -- look, a regime in -- which left

10

and it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on

11

local municipalities to have to come to Washington to

12

justify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which

13

would have to send an army out to example -- I mean, it

14

would sort of like be the -- the television commercial,

15

you know, where the guy is walking around saying, you

16

know, can you hear me now, can you hear me now?

17

is it made great sense to continue to leave the initial

18

decisions with local authorities.

19

The fact

But Congress had -- was frustrated, expressly

20

frustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which

21

they had let local authorities do it under their normal

22

routines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting

23

the job done.

24

And in the -- in the absence of any evidence, even now 11

25

years later -- or I guess it's 10 years -- 9 years later.

That was the imperative of this statute.

In the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. WAXMAN:

That isn't the only --

1983 is the background principle

7

against which Congress legislates.

all it does is confirm that when you go -- when you are

injured, you can go to court.
JUSTICE BREYER:

The other -- the other harm is

there any evidence of because it's -- it would also be

things, as well as good things about them.

18

it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning

boards were erring too much on the side of granting

of not granting them.

-- under the regulations of this municipality, which is --

2

is perfectly representative, it is final agency action

3

when the city planning commissioner says no, unless you

choose to appeal it to the city council.

5

And there is -- not only is there nothing

6

peculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the

7

violation by a State and local government of an express

8

Federal right, assuming you can prove not only that the

9

right was violated but also that you were really damaged.

10

It's -- I'm not suggesting that -- that Congress had

11

damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct.

12

You have said in a variety of instances -- I mentioned

13

Stacura in particular -- that 1983 damages do serve as a

14

deterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal

15

local officials.

16

But what Congress had -- Congress had to come up

with some way to confront this problem in which there were

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question, Mr.

Waxman?

21

exactly, but I have the impression that most of the

plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed,

23

large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff.

24

And therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive

25

to be sure these rights are protected.

And one thing we know for sure is that when

8

Congress enacted the Telecom Act of 1996, it specifically

9

wanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies.

10

It had specific provisions in the law to give special

11

treatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster

12

diversity and competition.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But in the event that you -I can't imagine -- I can't

14

imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose

15

damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without

16

even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their

17

mistakes, which is what you're saying.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -You're saying the

20

municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, the -- the -- 1983

does any other principle -- stands for the proposition

2

that it's there unless, in the explicit language of the

3

statute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated

4

incompatibility.

5

And that's the background rule.

There are many instances in the Telecom Act and

6

elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get

7

injunctive relief.

8

go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title

9

II of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly --

You may not get 1983 damages.

I mean,

10

expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation

11

of 1983.

12

And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my

13

client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was

14

subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged

15

and entrenched intransigence by this particular

16

municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example

17

in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v.

18

the Village of Mequon.

19

But this Court has recognized, as have the lower

20

courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you

21

really have been damaged.

22

there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct

23

it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus,

24

where the damages are purely nominal.

And in an instance where

opportunity to go back and correct it.

a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing

to go back and correct because the only thing -- the only

reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna

broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago

and have no right to modify.

And therefore, there was a

10

substantive violation, not just, you know, you -- you may

11

have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all

12

out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not

13

in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back.

14

There's a line of cases this Court has decided

15

under the Social Security Act where there have been

16

remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and

17

in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get

18

damages.

19

probably don't get attorney's fees either.

And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. LAMKEN:

I'd like to make only two brief

points.

7

First, that the imposition of the -- of damages

8

and fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court

9

for even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the

10

antenna siting rules, which are often complex and

11

uncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and

12

aggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees

13

on municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce

14

their zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly

15

attempted to preserve in the statute itself.

16

It is -- in this case alone, for example,

17

respondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees

18

-- and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add

19

-- is -- is $15 million, essentially the city's entire

budget for a year.

relatively small operator.

22

of liability in an uncertain area of law, very few

23

municipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights

24

certain that they are right.

And respondent claims to be a
