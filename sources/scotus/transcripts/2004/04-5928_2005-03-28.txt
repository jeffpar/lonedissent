CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Ordinarily do not
think of that as covered in this Court.

4

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, the Court of Criminal

5

Appeals did not specify; but we find, of course,

6

ourselves in an unusual posture, in the sense that the

7

sequence of events here are such that even -- the Court

8

of Appeals has decided the Avena judgement claim, the

9

Court has --

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But has this Court ever

11

just said, "Fine, we'll hold it in abeyance and come

12

back next term"?

14

I can't recall that we've done that.

MR. DONOVAN:
an unusual posture.

Well, it's an -- it is, in fact,

And it --

15

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

16

likely that we would dismiss this, improvidently

17

granted.

18

MR. DONOVAN:

I mean, it would be more

to the Court.

obligation that every actor here -- the United States,

Of course, the case was important when

in and said that it's even more important, by saying

2

that, in fact, the United States will comply.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, it's so odd, because

usually what happens, if there is something that could

5

occur at the state court level, is the state court

6

itself would hold off until this Court had resolved

7

whatever the case was.

8

request.

9

So, this is a very unusual

MR. DONOVAN:

We recognize that it's an

10

unusual request, because of the unusual circumstances.

11

And, of course, the alternative, if the Court is not

12

prepared to stay, or, for example, vacate, in light of

13

the presidential determination, remand to the Court of

14

Appeals --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, I think -- I

16

think granting a stay could be seen as validating the

17

position of the government without ever having an

18

opinion on it.

19

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, actually, I think that a

20

stay would actually show respect to each of the

21

relevant actors here.

22
23

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, why shouldn't we just

go ahead and decide the case, if we can?

24
25

And so --

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, we believe that there are,

in fact, firm grounds on which this Court could grant Page 5
Alderson Reporting Company

a34bda65-a6f1-42d8-83ec-09cfb6aa8dc6

- could decide the question presented, because, in

2

fact, for the reasons -- there are really three points

3

here -- for the reasons we've laid out, the Court,

4

under the direct command of the Supremacy Clause, has -

5

- can give effect to the Avena judgement as the rule of

6

decision.

7

eliminates the -- even setting aside its independent

8

force, eliminates the basic objection of Texas to that

9

course of action.

10

The President's determination, in fact,

And then, of course, there's the

basic independent full force of the Supremacy Clause.

11

So if I may move to that, the Court, as I

12

said, has recognized the importance of the United

13

States complying with an international obligation

14

reflected in treaties entered into by the

15

democratically elected representatives of the American

16

people.

17

I want to address the question presented

18

first, because, I -- before -- setting aside the

19

presidential determination -- and just take a look at

20

where we stand after the briefing by the parties as a -

21

- on the question whether or not the Avena judgement

22

provides the rule of decision.

23

First of all, there's an extraordinary amount

24

of agreement between petitioner and respondent.

25

Respondent agrees that the Vienna Convention is a

application and interpretation of the Convention to the

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

How about the

creation of a private right of action?

11

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, there is a -- there is a

12

-- there are basically three objections that the

13

Respondents made.

14

But the Respondent confuses the creation of a cause of

15

action with what the -- a treaty will typically do.

16

One of them is the cause of action.

The treaty here lays out the rights, and the

treaty lays out an individual right, as determinated by

18

the ICJ.

fundamental choice made by the Framers --

Here, in the first instance, we have a

MR. DONOVAN:

The private right of action is

found here in the habeas statute itself, which provides

10

that a person in custody in violation of laws,

11

treaties, or the Constitution of the United States can

12

seek --

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So, presumably, that could

14

provide some cause of action, quite irrespective of the

15

ICJ decision.

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, it could -- it -- the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is it right -- I mean,

5

you couldn't -- you could not -- unless the ICJ

6

decision gave a right to an individual, and you had no

7

claim under the federal habeas statute -- and it is

8

unusual, is it not, for a judgement of the

9

International Court of Justice to recognize the right

10

of an individual, as opposed to being just a judgement

11

between nations?

12

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, it may be that, because of

13

the character of the typical dispute that the

14

International Court of Justice hears, that it does not

Well, that's what I asked,

if this -- I know that, certainly in the context of the

22

Vienna Convention, there have been the series of

decisions you mentioned; but I was wondering whether,

24

outside the Vienna Convention, there has been any

25

similar judgement of the ICJ that operates directly on

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, for example, in the

4

again, there were rights of a particular company and a

5

particular national decided with -- under the guise of

diplomatic protection.

this case went forward.

only on its own behalf, but on behalf of its nationals.

And, therefore, if we think of the -- the three

objections that was -- the Respondent has made to

11

whether this Court can give us back the Avena

12

judgement, they come down -- they include the two we've

13

just discussed, and one more.

14

First, they've said there are no individual

15

rights here.

But, of course, the treaty, as this Court

16

suggested in Breard, talks specifically about rights --

17

quote/unquote, "rights."

18

the ICJ held.

19

the Avena judgement informs the Vienna Convention with

20

binding effect, then that question is not the question

21

this Court needs to answer.

And that, of course, is what

If the Avena judgement is binding, if

particular combat, the Commander in Chief will be

2

somebody other than the President of the United States?

3

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, the Court has recognized

4

that the only limitations of the treaty-making power

5

are affirmative litigations -- affirmative limitations

6

within the Constitution, itself.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

MR. DONOVAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

And -And you think that the

10

Constitution provides the President shall be Commander

11

in Chief, and, therefore, that can't be given away.

12

MR. DONOVAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. DONOVAN:

15

Well -Right?

-- no, the -- obviously, a

treaty would not be able to amend the Constitution.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

Well, what if I think

17

that the Constitution provides that all questions of

federal law -- statutory, treaty, constitutional -- are

19

to be decided, ultimately, by the Supreme Court of the

20

United States.

this treaty does not do that.

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, but the -- but the Court

3

has -- it -- the Court has regularly -- and it has

never been an objection to Article III power to give

5

effect to a judgement that has been rendered in another

6

sphere by another adjudicatory authority.

all the time with respect to --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That happens

Not a question concerning

United States law.

10

MR. DONOVAN:

But this is a question --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're talking here about a

12

question of United States law, What is the meaning of

13

this treaty that the United States has entered into?

14

Do you know another case where we have -- we have been

15

bound by a judgement of a foreign court or an

16

international court concerning the meaning of United

17

States law?

18

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, what the Court would be

19

giving effect to is the determination by the political

20

branches themselves to enter into the treaty.

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, I have a question

22

that is much along the same lines, whether this Court

23

must apply Avena as the rule of decision, or perhaps

24

say, "No, it does not have to do that."

Then you're

25

left with looking at the treaty itself.

And does that

And, can --

MR. DONOVAN:
apply the treaty.

Well, the Court could, in fact,

It could reach its own

10

interpretation of the treaty, in accord with the Avena

11

judgement.

But we think --

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

13

MR. DONOVAN:

Is that open in this case?

Well, it surely would be open in

14

this case, but it would not be open at this point.

15

We've suggested alternative bases by which the Court

16

could conform with Avena.

17

Avena, in fact, controls the decision, for this reason,

18

that, in the first instance, the political branches

19

have agreed to the substantive obligations under the

20

treaty; in the second place --

21
22

But we do believe that

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:
can't control?

23

Well, suppose we think it

Now, then what's open to us?
MR. DONOVAN:

Well, if the -- if the Court

24

decided that the Avena judgement did not control, then

25

it would obviously go to the terms of the treaty

But our argument is that, in fact, by virtue

of the political branches' decision and in operation of

MR. DONOVAN:

question presented.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You're simply saying that any

4

court has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction.

5

We grant you that.

6

what is your answer to the claim that the COA requires

7

a showing of substantial infringement of

8

constitutional, as distinct from other sources of,

9

rights?

10

But, granted that, if we reach it,

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, first of all, we believe

11

that in the posture that this case comes to this Court,

12

there has been a substantial denial of a constitutional

13

right, even in the terms that Texas defines the

14

statute, because what we have here is a claim based on

15

the Avena judgement -- I mean, the ICJ's interpretation

16

and application of the Avena judgement that the Court

17

of Appeals held in effect that had been defaulted prior

18

to its coming into existence.

19

the Court of Appeals judgement that the Avena --

20

dismissing the -- or denying the Avena -- deciding the

21

Avena judgement claim -- was to say -- was to give

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- the constitutional

violation is the violation of the Supremacy Clause.

3

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, in that --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. DONOVAN:

Is that what you're saying?

Well, it's a violation here of

6

both the Due Process Clause and the Supremacy Clause.

7

Due process --

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. DONOVAN:

Due Process Clause because?

Because it was an arbitrary

10

denial of a forum in which to hear the Avena judgement

11

claim, not simply the -- a different source of right.

12

In other words, although the Avena judgement claim

13

comes up on Texas as a proposition as a -- under a

14

treaty, the action of the Court of Appeals was to deny

15

that claim without giving it a forum.

16

without -- that -- before it had been raised itself,

17

before it even existed

18

Court of Appeals was to give effect to a procedural

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but is it not true that

11

it's entirely possible that the Texas proceeding would

make this issue moot --

MR. CRUZ:

That is true.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Executive determination may come back to this Court,

3

but they're not presented by the case right now before

4

the Court.

5

The most direct avenue, I would submit, for

6

this Court is to resolve this decision by affirming the

7

Fifth Circuit judgement, and by affirming it on the

8

grounds that a COA could not issue because this was not

9

a constitutional claim.

And that would necessarily

10

entail affirming Breard to the extent that Breard noted

11

that a subsequently enacted statute, the AEDPA, to the

12

extent of a conflict, superceded the Vienna Convention.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is the question -- how

3

fact that the President is acting underscores this,

4

that there is no precedent for an ICJ judgement being

judicially enforceable.

ICJ judgements in their own domestic courts.

rises to the individual rights.

however, would conflict with the express language of

the preamble to the treaty, and would also conflict

with the consistent position of the Executive Branch

6

36 years, the State Department has consistently

answered the question, that the Vienna Convention does

not give rise to individual rights.

believe the Breard case answers it, one way or the

other; but, given the United States' consistent

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Well, if we came to

3

the conclusion that the treaty, by its own force, did

4

not create enforceable individual rights, then we would

5

have to get to the question of whether the President's

6

proclamation changes that result.

7

MR. CRUZ:

Only in the most threshold sense;

8

because, on its face, the President's proclamation, or

9

determination, is focused only on state courts, and

10

what the President says is that he has determined that

11

the Avena decision will have binding effect in state

12

courts.

13

that does not have a binding effect on this proceeding;

14

but, rather, on a subsequent

topsy-turvy, that a treaty would have effect in state

18

MR. CRUZ:

We don't disagree that the

19

Executive could have chosen other avenues.

20

Nevertheless, Medellin's argument that, given the

21

Executive has said, "This should have effect in some

22

other proceeding," we should disregard what the

23

Executive has said about this proceeding and apply it

here, notwithstanding the President's express

determination it wouldn't apply here.

the ICJ said that these people are entitled to review

enforced is in the state court that rendered the

concerned, they don't care if it's done by some federal

relying on the President's determination, which are two

new sources of law that were not available at the time

MR. DREEBEN:

I do think that the Court would

13

have the option of availing itself of extraordinary

14

jurisdiction, but, as the Court made clear in the

15

Felker case, its exercise of extraordinary original

16

writs would be informed by the limitations that the

17

AEDPA imposes upon the grant of habeas corpus relief;

18

and, therefore, the Court should look to at least the

19

additional jurisdictional obstacle that the United

20

States and Texas has raised; and, namely, that is that

21

the decision that the Texas courts raised -- issued in

22

this case is not contrary to any Supreme Court decision

23

or a misapplication of any clearly established federal

24

law.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So all those are -- there are

a lot of reasons.

that jurisdictional ground from the Court of Appeals,

we'll decide a lot of issues that will create guidance.

with it; or we may decide, if they come out the other

some authority the other way.

12

I take it there's a treatise in the Fifth

13

Circuit case which does say that the word

"constitutional" here encompasses "treaty."

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, I do not think

16

that the Court should hold the case, pending the

17

outcome of the Texas proceedings.

Yeah, but suppose you lose --

9

See, suppose you lost across

That would be the argument for holding it -

MR. DREEBEN:

I think it would be close to

10

issuing an advisory opinion for the Court to decide an

11

important issue of federal law in which there is a

12

clear jurisdictional bar to the issuance of a

13

Certificate of Appealability, and I don't think that a

14

treatise creates enough of a doubt that

15

"constitutional" in the AEDPA, means "constitutional"

16

for this Court to embark on a wide-ranging exploration

17

of potentially very significant issues with

18

constitutional overtones.

19

The Avena decision is not a freestanding

20

source of law that can be administered by this Court

21

wholly apart from the President's determination.

22

the President did was to determine not that the treaty

23

has a particular meaning that favors Petitioner's case,

24

but that, as a matter of compliance with the obligation

25

of the United States, under international law, to

What

1

comply with a judgement of the International Court of

2

Justice -- or to determine not to -- but that, in the

3

interest of the rule of law and the obligations that

4

were taken on, the President would create a new source

5

of law, in effect, that would enable the enforcement of

6

that particular judgement, without respect to the

7

validity of the underlying merits determination that

8

the ICJ made.

9

But if this Court were to treat the ICJ

10

judgement as a freestanding source of law, it would

11

frustrate the Executive's ability to determine, in a

12

particular case, this determination by an international

13

tribunal should not be enforced and it should not be

14

given effect; rather, that the President might, in a

15

particular case, choose to -- not to comply with that

16

determination.

freedom in international affairs were this Court to

18

It is, Justice O'Connor, but it

these claims, which the state courts have never had an

opportunity to occasion.

And Mr. Medellin is

The question here is, How does this Court

20

fulfill its function of ensuring that the United States

21

complies with its international obligations that the

22

President has now confirmed he will comply with?

23

of course, the question here is not whether this --

whatever this Court does with respect to the question

this case, would no in any way constrain the

here we have a situation where the President has said

And so, this case does not raise questions --

7

if it operated directly under the Supremacy Clause --

does not raise a question about what would happen if,

in some future case, the political branches made a

different determination once an ICJ judgement came to

view, is respectful to the authority of this Court,

At a minimum, it might be

Medellin has never had a chance to bring the --

otherwise, to bring these claims to the Court.

16

therefore, the Court might, at some point -- at this

point, the best thing to do, if we are going to achieve

expeditious compliance with the President's

because Texas has opposed the Court's authority under

the direct operation of the Supremacy Clause, and now

Texas has told the Court that the President can't do

this either.

14

Medellin has every hope and expectation that the Texas

courts will see their obligations under the Supremacy
