ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioners submit that the Age Discrimination

11

in Employment Act prohibits an employment practice that

12

has a significant disparate impact on older workers if

13

that practice lacks any reasonable business justification.

14

The ADEA embodies Congress' determination that

15

age discrimination seriously impedes older Americans'

16

ability to participate fairly in the American work force.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Goldstein, let me just

18

interrupt a minute.

19

business justification.

20

is not a part of the plaintiffs' primary submission, is

21

it, that it does not show?

22

You say if it lacks the -- the

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But is it not a part of -- that

That's an affirmative defense.

Justice Stevens, there is not a

23

clear answer to that question in all candor.

24

before the Court.

It is not

I will tell you that the lower courts

Justice O'Connor's plurality opinion in Watson and the

Wards Cove rule rather than the post-1991 Civil Rights Act

rule.

question suggests, in subsection (f)(1) of the statute

5

where this provision comes from -- and let me just take us

6

to the language.

7

the blue book, the -- the blue petitioners' brief at page

8

1 are the relevant provisions.

That is a debatable proposition because, as your

9
10

It would probably be most useful.

(a)(2) we'll come back to.

In

That's the parallel

language to Griggs.

11

The reasonable factor other than age provision

12

is (f)(1), and it says:

13

-- this is at the bottom of the page.

14

unlawful for an employer to take any action otherwise

15

prohibited -- and I'm going to come back and focus on that

16

-- under subsection (a) where the differentiation is based

17

on reasonable factors other than age.

it shall not be unlawful for an
It shall not be

18

The fact that it says otherwise prohibited seems

19

to suggest that this is setting up an employer defense, as

20

your question indicates.

21

Western Air Lines case in 1986 said that the BFOQ

22

provision, which is in (f)(1) as well, is an affirmative

23

defense.

24
25

And the Court in the -- the

So I -JUSTICE BREYER:

You put your finger on exactly

what's the part of this case that's bothering me.

Read

4
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

through the language.

2

disparate impact does seem to be called for, and this

3

particular provision, reasonable factors other than age,

4

seems a defense to that, just as BFOQ is the defense to

5

disparate treatment.

6

As you read through the language,

And that all seems to work.

But you read the definition of reasonable factor

7

other than age to mean business necessity or even Justice

8

O'Connor's opinion, which is pretty tough.

9

an employer to make that defense.

It's hard for

And while making it

10

hard to make that defense in the case of gender or race

11

discrimination, in fact works in my opinion perfectly

12

well.

13

and you're going to have a nightmare because every effort

14

by any employer to equalize to any degree pay or treatment

15

of his or her employees is going to have a disparate

16

impact in respect to age because the correlation with age

17

runs into all kinds of things that it doesn't in the other

18

cases.

19

You start making it hard to make that defense here

So I can't believe that Congress really would

20

have wanted that, but the reason I can't believe it is

21

because I can't believe the business necessity part of it.

22

And so here I'm faced with a reg which, at one and the

23

same time, pulls in disparate impact and business

24

necessity, and now I don't know what to do.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I can tell you.

(Laughter.)

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The answer is that you should

3

recognize, as does the commission, which has delegated

4

rulemaking authority under the act, that business

5

necessity, which is the term of art that they used in the

6

regulation -- and we'll come back to it.

7

of the blue brief -- means different things in different

8

contexts.

9

citations where the EEOC has recognized the common sense

It's at page 2

And so I want to take you to the specific

10

principle.

11

employer practices correlate with age than they do with

12

race and gender.

13

We know that more things that are legitimate

It is --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldstein, before you do

14

that, before you deal with the EEOC regulation, this

15

statute doesn't -- at least on -- on the page 1 part you

16

called our attention to, doesn't refer to business

17

necessity.

18

reading this statute cold, I'd say, yes, that looks like

19

an affirmative defense to me, but reasonable factor seems

20

like something quite different than necessity.

21

necessary for the business to do this, but it's

22

reasonable.

23

-- it seems to me, at least arguably, an improper

24

construction of this act, that the EEOC got it wrong when

25

it referred to business necessity.

That's in the EEOC regulation.

If I were just

It isn't

And if that's -- then the business necessity

They were thinking of

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Griggs and -- and title VII, but this statute says

2

reasonable factors.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

Our position relies only

4

on the statute.

5

(f)(1) says that the employer's conduct merely has to be

6

reasonable.

7

We embrace the text of the statute.

We agree with that.

The point I would then take you to is that in --

8

if the Court were interested in the regulation -- we don't

9

think it's necessary to get to the regulation, but if it

10

were, the EEOC has said that it too recognizes that the

11

phrase, business necessity, in the context of the Age Act

12

does not mean essential to the business.

13

Let me tell you why it used the language it did,

14

business necessity, in the regulation just to clear it up.

15

And that is when this Court first used the words, business

16

necessity, in Griggs and then subsequently in Wards Cove,

17

it didn't have all the connotations that it does now as

18

being quite a high employer burden.

19

to you two things from Griggs.

20

If I could just read

Griggs said, the touchstone is business

21

necessity.

22

be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.

23

It simply required related to job performance.

backdrop on which the EEOC used the word.

25

If the employment practice cannot be shown to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the

Well, I'm not sure you're

right about that, Mr. Goldstein, because if you think of

what it was, it was a pen and paper test and it was a high

12

Griggs is an example of something that was a loose

13

business necessity rule.

14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That doesn't exist in the

So I -- I don't think that

My point is only terminological,

15

and that is, when the EEOC used those words, it did not do

16

so against a backdrop in which they carried a connotation

17

that was necessarily very strict, and it has said several

18

times -- and they are quoted in our brief -- that the

19

standard -- and this is just the bottom line.

20

it's a very important bottom line.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think

You don't care about those regs

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

We can and will.
Well, maybe you should

because I'm not so sure that the EEOC interpretation is

7

entitled to Chevron deference.

8
9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We do believe that it is

entitled to Chevron deference because they have delegated

10

rulemaking authority and there is some suggestion that the

11

because of language in subsection --

12
13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

after notice and comment, or is it a -- an interpretation?

14
15

But was this an actual rule

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is a post-notice and comment

rule.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but it interprets --

17

doesn't interpret the prohibitory section.

18

it might be understood as simply making an assumption

19

that, say, the Griggs rule would be applied in -- in this

20

Court.

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I mean, it --

It's conceivable you could read

22

it that way, although the EEOC has specified many times,

23

in the quarter century since it enacted the regulation,

24

that no, when we -- and let me take us to the text to

25

explain why, and that again is at page 2 of the blue

2

employment practice, including a test, is claimed as a

3

basis for different treatment of employees or applicants

4

for employment on the grounds that it is a factor other

5

than age, and such practice has an adverse impact on

6

individuals.

7

The regulatory materials cite to Griggs.

They said -- and this is the block quote.

When an

That's the reference to disparate impact.

8

But in all events, I do want to come back to the

bottom line, and that is the EEOC recognizes, we recognize

10

that it's easier to prove either a defense or to put the

11

burden on the plaintiff's case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a -- you have a

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

17

interpreted to say what the employer -- but the employer

just doesn't like paying these executives so much money

says, I want to pay the new younger janitors more.

There we've got it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

are.

I've lost my case.

2

Now, that's what is worrying me, and I thought

3

perhaps this reg that seems to say -- and lower courts

4

have accepted that I would lose my case -- that this reg

5

is outside Congress' -- the agency's authority for that

6

reason because Congress couldn't have intended that

7

result.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, let me take you to the

lines of cases that I think might concern you.

There were

10

a set of cases before this Court's decision in Hazen Paper

11

that involved two rules, Justice Breyer, and I will tell

12

you that you referred to in the Adams oral argument when

13

this case -- this issue came to you before.

14

to refer to a very specific set of cases.

These cases recognized that cost is a

cases aren't cost cases, but I know it's a concern.

say, look, if you want to cut your costs and get rid of

you to do one thing, and that is allow your more senior

11

12

13

They do not say, as did the

And so we don't --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Goldstein, you -- this is

14

-- this case arises out of a compensation program of the

15

employer, and why is it brought under 4(a)(2) instead of

16

4(a)(1) which addresses discrimination in compensation?

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice O'Connor, the lower

18

courts unanimously conclude, as does the commission, that

19

(a)(2), although it does not have the word compensation in

20

it, does apply to compensation and --

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But why in light of 4(a)(1)?

Because they understand 4(a) --

23

and let me take you -- everyone to the text just so we can

24

all be literally on the same page, and that is going to be

25

in the red brief at page 17a.

It is 623(a), and it's the

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

first block quote at the top of page 17a of the red brief.

2

They understand that 623(a)(1) refers to actions

3

against individuals, whereas 623(a)(2) refers to actions

4

against groups, group policy versus individual action, and

5

they do that because of the introductory language to

6

(a)(1) and (a)(2), to fail or refuse to hire or to

7

discharge any individual; whereas, (a)(2) refers to limit,

8

segregate, or classify his employees.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask a question at this

10

point going really back to the question I asked you at the

11

outset of the argument?

12

of service was a reasonable factor other than age and if I

13

thought this particular compensation program was based on

14

years of service rather than age, can I look at the

15

reasonable factor other than age in deciding whether your

16

complaint states a cause of action?

17
18
19

If I thought seniority or years

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

Hazen Paper established

that that is not -JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if I do look at it and if

20

I do come to the conclusion I've suggested, would I not

21

have to dismiss your complaint?

22
23
24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I may misunderstand the

hypothetical, Justice Stevens.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

The hypothetical -- and I

think it may be the case -- that you have a compensation

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

program which uses years of service as a basis for

2

classifying employees which has a disparate impact on

3

older workers, but it does -- also it relies squarely on a

4

reasonable factor other than age if you will call years of

5

service such a factor.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:
legitimate.

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

That's perfectly

That -- as I understand the hypothetical --

8

10

Yes.

-- suppose I want -I understand that to be this

case.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, it would not because the

12

rationale given by the employer here for -- let -- let me

13

take us to the facts and then the explanation that's given

14

by the employer.

15

the line police officers much bigger raises than they gave

16

usual set of cases?

money but not the rest of the cops who happen to all be

over 40, was that they wanted to bring the salary up to a

The criterion was that they took

criterion was the kind of rank they had before.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The question is not whether that

reasonable.

the question isn't whether they used a reasonable factor

litigation.

Remember --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It's possible it would expand

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's not the number of

much to have a single case that has a rule in it, say,

high.

That's

Your point is, well, what if

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8

MR. NAGER:

9

it please the Court:

10

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

If I may, I'd like to go straight to the

11

question as to why mere statistical correlations with age

12

don't create a prima facie case of discrimination because

13

of age.

14

This Court in its title VII cases has said that

15

a mere statistical correlation with race or sex can create

16

a prima facie case of discrimination because of race or

17

sex because it's advanced a proposition that there's no

18

inherent correlation between race and sex and ability to

19

perform a job or do a job.

20

Court has said that a statistical disparity is a departure

21

from the expected norm.

22

creates a suspect situation which could be treated as a

23

prima facie case of discrimination because of age, to use

24

the Court's term in Watson, the functional equivalent of

25

intentional discrimination.

And as a consequence, the

Thus, the statistical disparity

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

In the age context, the premise doesn't apply.

2

In the age context, as Justice Breyer pointed out in the

3

Florida Power argument, as he's pointed out again today,

4

age is inherently correlated with myriad selection

5

practices.

6

that's a little bit older than I am, but our mental and

7

physical capacities are not constant over our lifetimes.

8

They're different for each one of us, but statistically

9

they change over time and they deteriorate over time, and

It's painful to say, particularly to a Court

10

progress doesn't treat the skills and abilities that we

11

have with -- the same way to people who are at different

12

stages in life.

1

If-- if your argument has force, why haven't we been having

2

horrible example piled upon horrible example since 1981

3

when the EEOC took the position that it takes?

4

MR. NAGER:

The answer to that is as follows, is

5

that Justice -- Chief -- then Justice Rehnquist, now Chief

6

Justice Rehnquist, wrote a dissent from denial at the time

7

of Geller v. Markham.

8

and I do defend these cases for a living -- that put a

9

tremendous chill on the plaintiffs bar, and there were

10
11

And in my practical experience --

very few of these cases brought.
But contrary to Mr. Goldstein, who doesn't

12

represent employers and help them plan their selection

13

practices, employers made huge changes in the '80's and

14

the early '90's until this Court's decision in Hazen Paper

15

because employers were scared of these cases, and so

16

employers started managing the numbers.

17

of reductions in force in the late '80's, as I'm sure this

18

Court remembers, as our Nation went through a -- a

19

industrial restructuring.

20

reductions in force, I had to sit down with my clients and

21

break up the age of the work force into bands and see how

22

people were going to be affected and move numbers.

23

the irony, of course, is -- is in doing that, employers

24

adversely impact the very people who are benefited by the

25

disparate impact doctrine under title VII because the Age

happens is -- is you adversely impact the new entrants to

10

What do you do about the EEOC's

Why isn't that -- why isn't that entitled to

MR. NAGER:

Let me answer that.

First of all,

11

the -- the answer is, is you only get to Chevron deference

12

if this statute is not subject to construction by this

13

Court in phase one of Chevron.

14

this Court, looking at the language of the statute and the

15

other legal materials, interpret the statute to have a

16

single, reasonably clear meaning.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The first question is can

How can we possibly say that

18

it's not ambiguous when we have, in another context,

19

interpreted the identical language to permit --

2

3

satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.

And my point to Justice Breyer is -- is that the

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In that -- in that

5

case, we were construing the word age and age definitely

6

has a different meaning from sex or -- or race.

7

MR. NAGER:

I'm not saying that the -- the

8

General Dynamics case disposes of this case, Justice

9

Stevens.

I'm simply pointing out that, as Justice

10

Souter's opinion for the Court last term held, that

11

similar language in similar statutes can have different

12

meaning and not be ambiguous.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but not whole texts, not

14

-- I don't remember whether it was (1)-(1) and (2) or (a)

15

and (b), but this is not a word, age.

16

lines, and to -- and to say, oh, in Griggs we held that

17

the title VII language -- this language means you can have

18

a disparate impact theory, but in age, we're going to read

19

those very same words to prohibit.

20

you read to say, these words permit disparate impact, and

21

then you read the same words to say these words

22

prohibit --

MR. NAGER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

of the phrase, because of, either in title VII or in the

Age Act, is a natural, more conventional reference to

of title VII and because statistical correlations could

equal a functional equivalent of intentional

discrimination, construed title VII to go beyond intent-

point to the Court today is -- is that neither of those

Why isn't the -- the EEOC's resolution of that ambiguity

MR. NAGER:

directly and then come back and argue with you about your

premise.

13

Justice Kennedy pointed out, it is not an interpretation

14

of the prohibition of the statute.

15

17

Justice Scalia, that it's one thing to defer to an

MR. NAGER:

Tests which are asserted -- the last

11

other than age will be scrutinized in accordance with the

12

standards set forth at part 1607 of this title.

13

of this title is the Uniform Guidelines on Employee

disparate impact.

At that time, they said, look, it's going to be

MR. NAGER:

1

this is what they said in their comments -- this Court's

2

decision in Griggs required disparate impact analysis --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, all right.

But I mean,

4

they -- everybody knew what they were driving at at the

5

time they promulgated this.

6

if we're not governed by the reg, it must be because the

7

reg is outside the statutory authority.

8

outside the statutory authority if in fact it embodies too

9

tough a test.

10
11

MR. NAGER:

So it seemed to me that if --

And it might be

It's -- it's outside the -- the

statutory authority for two reasons.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But now we've heard it doesn't

13

embody that much of a tough test, and you know, the EEOC

14

isn't here to tell us --

15

MR. NAGER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. NAGER:

Well --- what in fact it thinks.

Mr. Goldstein cited a bunch of EEOC

18

briefs in his brief, and you'll notice he didn't quote a

19

single part of -- of those EEOC briefs which say that the

20

standard under the Age Act is less than the standard under

21

the Age Act.

22

opening brief where he quotes one sentence from an EEOC

23

brief where an EEOC appellate lawyer said it is -- is

24

likely that an employer will be able to prevail more

25

often.

What he cites to is a footnote in his

Washington, DC 20005

1

The EEOC never said -- and -- and I litigate

2

against them.

3

would hate less but hate a lot than your ruling in our

4

favor that there's no disparate impact claims at all is

5

that Mr. Goldstein has represented what their version of

6

the defense is because that's not the Government's

7

position.

8
9

I can tell you the only thing that they

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

what the Government's position is.

So we don't know

They're not here.

10

suppose I think, one, the language is against you, the

11

language of the statute.

12

Two, the EEOC reg does foresee a disparate impact test.

13

Three, the practicalities are absolutely with you, and

14

that has to go with the scope of the statute.

15

it might be possible for the EEOC to write a reg that

16

deals with the problems you're worried about while

17

advancing a disparate impact test.

18

those things --

So

23
24

I do think it's against you.

Suppose I think all

MR. NAGER:

appeared and told us what they want to do or what they

2

think should be done, et cetera.

3

MR. NAGER:

I -- I should -- I would submit,

4

Justice Breyer, that you should reexamine your premise

5

that the language of the Age Act, both in section 4(a) by

6

itself and construed in light of 4(f) and the legislative

7

history and purposes of the statute encompass disparate

8

impact claims.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe the EEOC regulation was

10

not so much an interpretation of the statute as an

11

interpretation of Griggs.

12

MR. NAGER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, I think that's -I mean, maybe this provision

14

represents the judgment of the agency that Griggs applies

15

to this other statute, and -- and I'm not sure that we owe

16

Chevron deference to that determination.

17

MR. NAGER:

Well, I -- I don't think you did,

18

although I don't even think, frankly, from what I've read

19

is they made the judgment.

They made the assumption.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, well.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Nager, will you go to

22

another one of Justice Breyer's premises?

23

following the practicalities are with you, which you're

certainly going to accept.

deal with some of these practical problems.

so?

Why not?
MR. NAGER:

they can't.

Great question and the answer is no,

And the reason is --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

5

MR. NAGER:

Give me some examples.

The reason is -- is because if you

6

-- if you lower the prima facie case so that it's

7

meaningless, so that it means that all a plaintiff has to

8

do is find a selection practice -- because it's always

9

going to correlate with age -- it means you shifted the

10

burden to an employer in every case to establish that its

11

-- its practice meets whatever standard your hypothesizing

12

the EEOC might come up with later, Justice Breyer.

13

Meanwhile, the world has to go on, and what my

14

clients will do is as follows.

15

know, we're not going to wait to see if -- if this new

16

practice we're going to consider is going to stand the

17

test of time in court and under the EEOC's yet-to-be-

18

articulated regulation.

19

tried and true.

20

if we're going to innovate, we're going to massage the

21

numbers while we do it.

22

They will say, well, you

We're going to stick with the

We are not going to innovate at all, and

JUSTICE BREYER:

The employers -That would be a fairly easy

23

burden -- a fairly easy burden to meet.

24

you a fairly easy burden is consistent with the idea of

25

trying to get employers to think about the problem.

And -- and to give

An

37
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

employer who uses a different factor which is correlated

2

with age but it's -- it's an unreasonable thing to do or

3

it isn't the real basis hasn't thought about the harm that

4

he's working.

5

MR. NAGER:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

So we could give you an easy

burden and still accomplish the objective.

8
9

Well, as --

MR. NAGER:

I -- I don't want to resist the easy

burden, but I do want to tell you, as Justice Scalia

10

pointed out in the Florida Power argument, my clients do

11

think about these things because if -- you know, if they

12

adopt an unreasonable practice that has an adverse

13

statistical effect and they think they're likely to get

14

sued about it, they actually do have to worry about it

15

because these cases are tried to juries and they have to

16

have a reasonable explanation for what their practice

17

because they get tried to juries as disparate treatment

18

cases.

19

Our point is not that statistics are not

20

admissible.

21

not sufficient by themselves to create a prima facie case

22

of -- because of age, as it would be in a title VII case

23

where we wouldn't expect to see the statistical disparity.

24

So it's fair to say that there's a reasonable adverse

25

inference to be drawn from the existence of the disparity

They are.

Our point is -- is that they're

38
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

itself.

2

to why the disparate impact doctrine can -- can at -- the

3

prima facie case aspect of it equals a prima facie case of

4

discrimination because of race or sex.

5

here.

6

That is the premise articulated by this Court as

That is not true

Now, it is also the case that when this Court

7

adopted the disparate impact doctrine, it said it placed

8

an enormous weight on the objectives of title VII's

9

prohibitions, which it construed to be, as Justice

10

Ginsburg pointed out, eliminating these built-in

11

headwinds.

12

Well, when -- when the Secretary of Labor

13

proposed the Age Discrimination Act, he gave a report to

14

Congress and he said age discrimination is different than

15

race and sex discrimination.

16

It is -- it is not dealing with a group of individuals who

17

have suffered cumulative disabilities over their lifetime

18

because of historic discrimination.

19

problem of age discrimination is the problem of over-

20

generalization by an employer.

But his solution was not a disparate

His solution was --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it's a little, and you

6

said his solution was we're going to have training and

7

manuals and all.

8
9

But that's not altogether clear.

MR. NAGER:
Justice Ginsburg.

Well, take a look at the statute,

Please look at page 15a and 16a in the

10

red brief.

11

the bottom of page 15a of the red brief -- Congress said

12

what the purposes of the Age Discrimination Act were, and

13

it had three, but it's only addressed one through the

14

prohibition.

15

discrimination in employment.

16

promote employment of older persons based on ability and

17

to help employers and workers find ways of meeting

18

problems arising from the impact of age on employment.

19

And if you turn the page and look at section

And if you look at section 621(b) -- it's at

The second one was to prohibit arbitrary age
The other two were to

20

622(a)(1), the very first thing Congress mandates that the Secretary

21

shall do to address its other two purposes, to undertake

22

research and promote research with a view to reducing

23

barriers to the employment of older persons and the

24

promotion of measures for using their skills.

25

What the Secretary of Labor's report goes on at

40
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

length about is it identifies all kinds of factors,

2

neutral and non-neutral --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it doesn't say there that

4

that is to implement the first -- that -- that only the

5

second one, to prohibit arbitrary age discrimination.

6

MR. NAGER:

7

it doesn't say the following.

8

don't want disparate impact, because in 1967 the -- the

9

concept of disparate impact as a legal theory was unknown

It does -- what it -- you're right
It doesn't say, and we

10

to Congress, to the courts, and to the administrative

11

agencies.

12

But what the Secretary of Labor did do in his

13

report is, after identifying all of the problems that

14

adversely affect older workers, he says, I recommend a

15

two-pronged approach.

16

coercive.

17

discrimination in employment, which the Secretary

18

explained to Congress, and this Court last term said

19

itself, means a -- is a -- is -- is the use of age as the

20

decision-making criteria.

21

One prong is prohibitory.

It's

You shall not -- we'll prohibit arbitrary age

He said, separately we should have a series of

22

programs that seek to enlarge the abilities of older

23

workers, that seek to educate employers about the

24

abilities of older workers through non-coercive programs.

25

And so what this statute does -- and this Court

41
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has said it in several of its cases -- this statute was

2

based upon the Secretary of Labor's report.

3

wrote the bill, and although Congress amended it in other

4

ways, it didn't amend any of these provisions.

5

statute took a more nuanced approach to deal with a

6

distinctly different problem, and the problem --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The Secretary

That this

Mr. Nager, at the end of his

8

report, Secretary Wirtz said the -- a purpose, to

9

eliminate discrimination in the employment of older

10

workers, it would necessary not only to deal with overt

11

acts of discrimination, but also to adjust those present

12

employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to

13

age limits in hiring.

14

And your point, as I understand it, yes, that

15

was one of his purposes, but he meant that one to be

16

accomplished with ERISA and other things like that.

17

MR. NAGER:

Well, the quote that you just gave

18

says that there are express uses of age and there are non-

19

age reasons that lead to the use of express limits of age,

20

for example, the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave

21

with Mr. Goldstein, saying, well, I wouldn't want to hire

22

someone who's going -- who tells me they're going to

23

retire a year from now.

24

hire you because you're 64 because I know you're going to

25

-- people retire at 65 mostly, that would be the same kind

But if he said I'm not going to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

of non-age-based motive that nevertheless used age as a

2

decision-making criteria.

3

referring to.

4

That's what that quote is

If you -- if you -- the second half --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The quote -- the reference to

5

employment practices which quite unintentionally lead to

6

age limits in hiring.

I see what you're saying.

7

MR. NAGER:

8

And then -- and -- and the point here is this

9

was thought out.

Right.

It wasn't thought out as disparate

10

treatment versus disparate impact because the concepts

11

didn't exist at the time, but it was thought out as

12

arbitrary age discrimination versus other factors that

13

adversely bear on older workers.

14

arbitrary age discrimination and didn't go to the adverse

15

impacts.

16

went to the adverse impacts.

The prohibitions went to

It was the -- the non-coercive measures that

17

Let me go also --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

No how does that work?

19

Because the -- the particular language, it shall be

20

unlawful for an employer to classify his employees in any

21

way that would adversely affect an individual's status --

22

his status, it says -- as an employee because of such

23

individual's age.

24

right at disparate impact.

25

classify an employee in any way that would adversely

Now, that sounds as if it's driving
It's -- it's unlawful to

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

affect him because of his age.

2

That's what it says.

And then you turn to the defense and it says, but

3

there's the defense with a differentiation, i.e., the

4

classification is based on reasonable factors other than

5

age.

6

the factor and ask is the factor reasonable.

7

employer wins if it's really based on that factor.

And therefore it would sound as if it says, look at

8

MR. NAGER:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Two points?

10

MR. NAGER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

If so, the

Yes.

One is -- is -How do we get out of that

language?

13

MR. NAGER:

Well, we love the language.

14

don't have to get out of it.

15

That's a reference, a traditional, conventional

16

reference --

17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

We

It says because of age.

No, no, but it says -- it says

that would adversely affect him because of his age.

19

MR. NAGER:

Well, the first -- before the comma

20

is the statement both of the action of the employer and

21

the injury that it has to cause in order for a claim to

22

exist, and then there's another requirement.

23

requirement is -- is that the action and the -- the effect

24

of -- the injury that's affected by it be -- because of

25

age.

The

That is a conventional reference to intent.

44
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And the confirmation that it's a reference --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Oh, no.

It's not intent

3

because to read it as part of classifying, which

4

you'd have to do to get it because of intent, you'd have

5

to say to classify his employees because of such

6

individual's age.

7

you're talking about employees, and then you go to such

8

individual.

9

Now, that's a little tough because

MR. NAGER:

It -- it -- the phrase, because of

10

age, modifies all of the words that precede the comma that

11

separates the two.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Segregate or classify.

You

13

want to read it all the way up back to segregate or

14

classify.

15
16
17

MR. NAGER:

Well, I -- I think it does modify

the verb, but -JUSTICE SCALIA:

It would be good if you had a

18

comma after employees.

19

there was a comma after -- to limit, segregate, or

20

classify his employees, comma, in any way which would

21

deprive or tend to deprive any individual of opportunities

22

or otherwise affect his status as an employee, comma,

23

because of such individual's age -- go way back to before

24

the comma.

25

-- that's an awful travel back to limit, segregate, or

I -- I might go along with you if

I can see that, but without the comma, that's

45
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

classify.

2

MR. NAGER:

Well, I -- I think that's the

3

grammatically correct way to read it.

4

it was just modifying the adversely affect --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. NAGER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

But even -- even if

It would be the natural way.

-- it would still be because of age.
The natural way -- wait.

The

natural way is to read it as modifying to deprive --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Right.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- or otherwise adversely

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the natural way to read

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It is.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now --

17

MR. NAGER:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

14

20

affect.

it.

One still --- suppose we read it that way.

Then what do you say?
MR. NAGER:

You -- even if you read it that way,

21

it still says, comma, because of age, and the because of

22

age is a reference to intent, and the confirmation of

23

that, Justice Breyer, is the defense that you keep

24

pointing to because as Mr. Goldstein conceded in his brief

25

and as you pointed out in your questioning, it says, is

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

based on.

2

statute is preoccupied with intent.

3

That is also a reference to intent.

This

What section 4(f) was about was identifying the

4

situations in which age would be used but it, nonetheless,

5

wouldn't even be arbitrary --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indeed, and I guess what

7

supports that reading is that intent -- intent to

8

discriminate in hiring -- the intentional discrimination

9

because of age in hiring is covered by (2) rather than (1)

10

isn't it?

11

MR. NAGER:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, no.
You think -- I mean, if -- if

13

you have a rule -- if you have a rule that you won't hire

14

any employee -- I mean, we -- we were talking earlier

15

about the -- the reason -- (2) reads employees in the

16

plural, and (1) reads refuse to hire or discharge any

17

individual.

18

that is against a class, it comes under (2) rather than

19

(1).

20
21
22

So if you have any intentional discrimination

MR. NAGER:

I had never thought of construing

the -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that wrong?

Well, I thought

23

-- I thought that's what -- what counsel for the

24

petitioner was telling us.

25

MR. NAGER:

Well, if -- if he did, he's only

strengthened our case.
What I want to say to the Court is -- is that

3

both of those provisions are modified by the phrase,

4

because of age.

5

because of language in 4(a)(1) as a reference to intent

6

and said statistical correlations with age are not

7

sufficient to establish because of age within the meaning

8

of section 4(a)(1).

9

-- we're entitled to point to it as well that the

This Court in Hazen Paper construed the

And the presumption of uniform usage

10

presumption of uniform usage which would be that the

11

phrase, because of age, in section 4(a)(2) is also not

12

satisfied by a mere statistical correlation with age.

13

And the reason why title VII is different than

14

the Age Act -- I keep coming back to this because this is

15

so critical, Justice Breyer -- is that the premise of the

16

Court's statistical cases under title VII is that it's --

17

it presumes that there's no inherent difference in ability

18

between the races and the genders, whereas you know and I

19

know that there is a difference in an -- an inherent

20

correlation between abilities and skills, between people

21

of different ages statistically.

22

the -- in the race and sex context, a statistical

23

disparity by itself points out that there's something

24

suspect and so would justify putting the employer to the

25

burden on those occasions which would happen.

And so that whereas in

48
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

definition, I think you and I both think, Justice Breyer,

2

that it's not all that often that you're going to have

3
