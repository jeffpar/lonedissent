ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PETRO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. PETRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The purpose of any hearing process is to get a

12

better answer.

13

past, an adversarial fact-finding can help provide the

14

answers.

15

and predict future behavior, then a slightly more limited

16

procedure will serve to expedite and arrive at the best

17

possible answer to this predictive question.

18

If the question is what happened in the

If, however, the question seeks to look forward

JUSTICE SCALIA:

General Petro, before you get

19

into the details of why -- why you think the process here

20

was all that was due, I'm -- I'm more concerned about the

21

preliminary question of whether there was a liberty

22

interest here.

23

existence of it, but I'm not sure that lets me off the

24

hook.

25

I -- I know you haven't challenged the

We -- we had a case some years ago in which both

3
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they

2

conceded in the -- in the court of appeals that the

3

statute existed and wanted us to say what this

4

presumptively existing statute said.

5

there was serious doubt about whether the statute had been

6

properly enacted, we had to reach that question first

7

because we were not going to speculate on what a, you

8

know, hypothetical statute said.

9

And we held, since

And I think you're asking us to do sort of the

10

same thing here.

11

conceding or -- the Government doesn't concede anyway.

12

The United States doesn't.

You're -- if -- you know, without even

13

MR. PETRO:

14

JUSTICE SCAIA:

No they don't.
You're asking us to hold that

15

if this is covered by the Due Process Clause, what you've

16

given here is enough.

17

speculate on -- on hypothetical questions like that.

18

But I don't -- I don't like to

And it -- it really seems to me that to say that

19

there's a liberty interest here flies in the face of our

20

more reasoned opinions in this area, especially Sandin

21

which -- which has some language that's -- that's almost

22

-- almost right on point.

23

is it?

totally discretionary confinement in either duration or

We note also that this -- where

Conner's confinement did not exceed similar but

liberty interest in not -- in not being put in a maximum

Presumably you could put all your

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. PETRO:

10

So if you wanted to, you could

put all of your prisoners in maximum security.
MR. PETRO:

Right?

Yes, I agree, Your Honor, that we

could.

15

So there's -- there's no Eighth

No.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

No -- no, we don't, Your Honor.

Amendment problem.

9

11

I mean, you don't pull

JUSTICE SCALIA:
interest here?

16

So where is the liberty

I don't understand.

MR. PETRO:

We -- we made a decision in

17

petitioning the Court that the liberty interest issue was

18

something that we would not raise.

19

through the district court and through the circuit court.

20

We chose not to raise it here to focus on the due process

21

issue.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We raised it on appeal

Well, I understand, but I feel

23

like something of a fool being asked, you know, Justice

24

Scalia, if -- if there were a liberty interest here, would

25

these procedures be enough to secure it.

That's not the

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

kind of work I usually do.

2

-- answer real questions.

3

MR. PETRO:

I -- you know, I usually ask

The -- the circuit court made a

4

factual determination that there was a significant and

5

atypical deprivation.

6

that determination, but because it was a factual

7

determination, we chose to confine our appeal to the issue

8

of law.

9

We would respectfully disagree with

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but there is a -- there

10

is a question of law involved as to whether there's a

11

liberty interest.

12

MR. PETRO:

13

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.
In the Sandin case in 1995,

14

this Court said that prisoners have a State-created

15

liberty interest only where the deprivation or restraint

16

imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in

17

relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.

18

Now, I guess to be categorized in category 5 in

19

your State, it does involve putting someone in solitary

20

confinement, reducing their time for exercise, and

21

reducing their options for parole.

22

MR. PETRO:

Is that correct?

That is correct.

But when people

23

are moved to level 5, Your Honor, typically they're being

24

moved from level 4, at least more than 90 percent of the

25

time, and level 4 has a similar area of restriction.

In

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

reality, I would argue -- and I would concur with Justice

2

Scalia -- that this is not a significant or atypical

3

deprivation --

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, do you take the -- why

5

don't you simplify it by telling us whether you take the

6

position today that there is or is not a liberty interest

7

here?

8

MR. PETRO:

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Your Honor, we chose not to --

10

MR. PETRO:

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MR. PETRO:

I know you did.

-- petition on that.
I'm asking you your opinion.

Your Honor, I would be most pleased

13

to argue that there is no liberty interest in this

14

instance under Sandin.

15

where there is a mandatory State-created interest, that

16

interest would have to involve a significant and atypical

17

deprivation.

18

moving an inmate to level 5 classification is a

19

significant or atypical deprivation.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

21

The Court made it very clear that

In this instance, we do not believe that

What if he were moved from

level 1 to level 5?

22

MR. PETRO:

Your Honor, that has not occurred in

23

reality.

24

from admission to level 5.

25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There have been several inmates that have moved

But why isn't the comparison

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the entire prison population rather than just 5 versus 4?

2

MR. PETRO:

Your Honor, it's just typically what

3

occurs, and so there are some circumstances where a level

4

3 inmate may be moved to 5, but in any event, that inmate

5

would have been moved to 4.

6

in a practical standpoint --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The classification jump is,

Well, is it -- is it your view

8

that we should consider it the normal practice in the Ohio

9

system to keep people in solitary for 23 hours a day?

10
11
12
13
14

MR. PETRO:
practice.

Your Honor, that's not the normal

In fact, it involves -JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, then isn't that the

standard of reference that we should use?
MR. PETRO:

Your Honor, it involves a small

15

number of inmates, and those inmates have been determined

16

through a very predictive determination that -- that in

17

fact they do pose a threat --

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So we're -- we're dealing with

19

a small number of inmates out of a very large population,

20

but isn't the frame of reference for telling whether it's

21

a liberty interest a comparison to the large population?

22

MR. PETRO:

Your Honor, the -- the deprivation

23

is -- is perhaps marginally greater, but I would suggest

24

that it is marginal, and therefore --

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you say it's marginally

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

greater than 4.

2

certainly.

3

It's not marginally greater than 1 or 2

MR. PETRO:

Your Honor, I would submit that it

4

is -- it is more -- it is much greater than 4.

5

whether it represents something that is unexpected by the

6

inmate, in reality the inmate has an expectation of having

7

his liberty essentially extremely limited in this

8

instance --

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But

Well, but the -- the point of

10

the case is that the inmate does not expect to be put in

11

solitary confinement for 23 or 23 and a half hours a day

12

for a period of 1, 2, or more years without some process

13

to do it because that is so extraordinarily onerous and so

14

different from the general run of incarceration practice.

15

MR. PETRO:

And -- and, Your Honor, we initiated

16

a process.

17

district court and then the circuit court ultimately ruled

18

on, where we made --

19

It is our New Policy 111-07, which the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That -- but that's what --

20

that's what you wanted to talk about, but we're on, first,

21

the preliminary question.

22

MR. PETRO:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
And is -- I think you started

24

to say that you regarded atypical and significant as a

25

fact-finding which was made against you --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PETRO:

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
-- based on the extreme

3

conditions of this kind of confinement where you don't see

4

another human.

5

MR. PETRO:

Yet, Your Honor, we would -- I would

6

continue to -- to argue that it is not -- if it is

7

significant and atypical, it is marginally significant and

8

atypical.

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wasn't solitary confinement

involved in Sandin?

11

MR. PETRO:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, it was.
Didn't we say in Sandin that

13

solitary confinement was -- was not enough to -- to

14

create --

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

17

For how long?
30 -- for 30 days I believe,

wasn't it?

18

MR. PETRO:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Not 1 year, 2 years, 3 years.

20

MR. PETRO:

And in this case the -- but --

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

No.

21

but level 5 as a classification is a limited confinement.

22

It is reserved for those very dangerous inmates not

23

dissimilar to Sandin.

24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but typically it has

been represented maybe -- maybe wrongly -- typically it

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

has been represented that they tend to be in there for a

2

year or 2-year periods.

3

MR. PETRO:

Your Honor, they are reviewed from a

4

classification standpoint on an annual basis.

5

reviewed from a privilege standpoint -- and there's

6

different levels within 5 -- on a quarterly basis and

7

so --

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They are

But in -- but in fact, they

tend to be in there for the extended periods of time.
Isn't that --

11

MR. PETRO:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

That -- that's correct, Your Honor.
Mr. -- General Petro,

13

I for one would like to hear what you have to say about

14

the question presented in your petition for certiorari.

15

MR. PETRO:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. PETRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

In this instance, the process due,

18

as provided by Ohio, was outlined in New Policy 111-07.

19

That policy was adopted and ultimately then reviewed by

20

the district court.

21

unconstitutional and added a number of other procedures.

22
23
24
25

The district court held it to be

The process that was contained in New Policy
111-07 was a predictive policy, and it understood -JUSTICE SOUTER:
question about that?

May -- may I just ask you a

I realize that there is a predictive

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

element.

2

points of contention here, as I understand it, is that

3

even the new policy did not give a -- an -- an inmate a

4

statement of the charge or reason for the -- for the

5

reclassification to 5.

6

I don't think anyone disputes that.

MR. PETRO:

Is -- is that correct?

Your Honor, it gave notice, 48 hours

7

in advance, under the new policy --

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

9

MR. PETRO:

10

One of the

Notice of what?

Notice of the fact that there would

be a reclassification.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But did it give notice of the

12

reason for the reclassification?

13

You are such and such kind of person, a gang member.

14

it tell him anything?

15

MR. PETRO:

You did such and such.
Does

It doesn't spell out -- in New

16

Policy 111-07, it doesn't spell out all the evidence, but

17

it gives a basic --

18
19
20
21
22

JUSTICE SOUTER:

No, not the evidence, just the

reason.
MR. PETRO:

It gives a basic statement that

you're being considered for reclassification.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

I -- I know that, but does it

23

say you're being reconsidered for -- considered for

24

reclassification because you hit somebody over the head or

25

because you've shown that you're a member of a gang or

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

some other reason?

2
3

MR. PETRO:

It -- it as a general rule does not

have to do that, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about -- I mean, the

5

person, if he reads the regulation, would see that it says

6

that to classify him, the State has to show that through

7

repetitive and seriously disruptive behavior, he has

8

demonstrated a chronic inability to adjust as evidenced by

9

repeated class 2 rule violations.

10

MR. PETRO:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
So I guess he would like to

12

know give me at least a vague idea of what behavior you're

13

talking about and which class 2 rule violations you're

14

talking about.

15

things?

16

Now, does the notice tell him those two

MR. PETRO:

The notice is very general in its

17

nature.

18

there's an opportunity to sit down and actually discuss

19

with the inmate, and the inmate can respond in writing or

20

in presence at the -- at the hearing --

21

At the time that the hearing actually commences,

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, you say he has the

22

opportunity.

23

reclassified or our proposal is to reclassify you because

24

you violated this particular regulation by this particular

25

conduct?

Do you actually tell him you are about to be

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PETRO:

There is -- what initiates the

2

reclassification is a report form that would identify to

3

the inmate --

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm asking you what you tell

5

the inmate, not what initiates your process.

6

answer my question.

7

MR. PETRO:

Now, please

The inmate, Your Honor, has access

8

to the report form that says specifically what's

9

initiated.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

11

at which point does he get access?

12

MR. PETRO:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

At which point does he get --

At the point of notice.
So -- so this -- I mean, that's

14

what I don't understand what this case is about because I

15

-- I'm amazed that -- I think it is too detailed what

16

they're requiring of you, by far.

17

But the elements are I have to know.

I'm an

18

inmate.

19

think they're wrong.

20

they're wrong.

21

know is after the committee or the warden decides against

22

me, what are his reasons.

23

I want to know are the basic reasons.

24
25

I want to know what is this about.

Suppose I

I need to know how to tell them

And the other thing I think I'd need to

I'm not asking for a book.

All

Now, those things I can't work out from the
briefs, quite honestly, whether the new policy gives him

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

those new things, those two things, or doesn't.

2
3

MR. PETRO:

The new policy gives him the basic

information that we are asserting that --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, already you say that, but

5

I would think the basic information includes some idea of

6

what my disruptive behavior was and some idea of what the

7

class 2 violations that I was convicted of were.

8

I've heard you both say that he does get it and that he

9

doesn't get it.

And now,

I'm sure that's my fault, but I want to

10

know, does he get this information before the hearing, or

11

does he not?

12

MR. PETRO:

Your Honor, he gets the basic reason

13

for the classification and that's --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

MR. PETRO:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. PETRO:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. PETRO:

Now -- you heard what I said.

Yes, I did, Your Honor.
Does he get what I just said?

Yes, he does.
He does.

He gets the basic information.

20

doesn't get a list of any evidence.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

He

Well, what does he -- can you

22

-- can you describe it for us what -- he gets 48 hours

23

notice.

24

MR. PETRO:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

MR. PETRO:

5

What else does he get?

Does he get a

Does he get a -- a
What --

At the close of the hearing, he --

there is --

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

Before the hearing

7

starts, he gets 48 hours notice, but is he -- is he just

8

told there's going to be a hearing in 48 hours and that's

9

it?

10

MR. PETRO:

There's going to be a hearing and

11

it's for reclassification, and here is -- here is the --

12

the actual report that actually identifies what has

13

triggered this activity for reclassification.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

15

MR. PETRO:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. PETRO:

So he does get the report.

So he gets -48 hours --

But it's a very bare bones report

18

and it doesn't identify the specific evidence involved

19

which --

20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, I don't care that he

doesn't have evidence.

22

MR. PETRO:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
I want to know that he thinks

24

he's being sent to this prison because his roommate, Rat

25

Fink, has made up a bunch of stories about him.

that this board is considering before he can come in and

6

it because he has the report.

So he needs to know whether -- what it is that --

He doesn't have to have all

He has to know what the point is, what the
And you're saying he gets

7

Is there an example in the record of a report?

8

MR. PETRO:

9

There's an example of the report

form that is filled out by the prison officials at the

10

time that a reclassification is going to occur, and the

11

inmate does have access to that report form at the time of

12

notice.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask this -Perhaps we can be concrete.

15

If he -- suppose the charge is he is a gang leader.

16

he get notice that says you are being considered for

17

reclassification because you are a gang leader?

The procedures that Ohio provides for placement

2

into its supermax prison facility are more than ample to

3

satisfy due process.

4

As the Federal Government has argued in its

5

brief, the Bureau of Prisons believes there is no liberty

6

interest implicated here.

7

there is, the type of decision at issue is inherently a

8

predictive one that turns on the holistic judgment of

9

prison officials.

10

But even if one assumes that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it a predictive

11

judgment that a person is a gang leader?

12

decision, given the facts and circumstances, we predict

13

that this person is among the worst of the worst, but the

14

findings that have to be made along the way are not

15

necessarily predictive.

16

the -- if the issues came simply divided what happened in

17

the past, what might happen in the future, but the

18

judgment that's made to classify someone as 5 inevitably

involves some, well, what happened in the past on the

20

basis of which we can project what might happen in the

future.

MS. MAYNARD:

The ultimate

would have three responses to that.

of Prisons, in the large majority of instances, most of

the facts upon which a predictive assessment would turn

2

have already been subject to some more formal type --

3

trial-type procedure.

4

Prisons, the vast majority of prisoners who are placed in

5

one of our two more restrictive facilities have committed

6

some violent act in prison for which they have been found

7

to be guilty pursuant to formal Wolff-type, trial-type

8

procedures.

9

For example, in the Bureau of

Secondly, with respect to facts that might be

10

taken into consideration for which there hasn't yet been

11

such a formal trial-type proceeding, this Court has made

12

clear that when you're talking about the types of

13

predictive risk assessments that are at issue here, it is

14

appropriate for prison officials, using their expertise

15

and judgment and knowledge of the prison conditions in

16

their prison and in the prison system as a whole, to take

17

into account things that are rumor, innuendo, and other

18

imponderables that may not have been proven in any fact-

19

type proceeding.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that would be -- that

21

would be a what happened question, not what might happen.

22

What happened, the determination might be made on the

23

basis of rumor or innuendo.

24

questions don't come labeled so simply, predictive versus

25

what happened in the past.

My only point is that

I agree with that.

But again, I believe that most of the -- the facts upon

which these decisions are based and -- and Ohio asserts in

its brief that that's the case in their case too, that

14

just the individual inmate.

15

fact-finding retrospective proceeding that the court below

16

required here is going to focus the decision-maker in the

17

wrong direction and on a more narrow set of facts than

18

ideally we want the prison administrators to focus upon.

19

We want them to be looking at, just like in Hewitt, the

your position may be correct, but I -- I just can't place

a lot of store in this predictive versus nonpredictive

judgment, and it's contrary to your own argument.

6

say, well, in almost all the cases, it's because he's been

adequate.

Or would you?
MS. MAYNARD:

Yes.

We believe that the

procedures that Ohio provides are -- are more than

16

adequate because it gives the prisoner notice of the

17

charges and an opportunity to contest the placement

that Ohio provides is more than is necessary to satisfy

would this Court then make of the case?

MS. MAYNARD:

There's -- still, the appropriate

5

analysis, when you're talking about -- basically what we

have at bottom --

8

that a -- a trial-type proceeding is necessary, and in

9

fact, it's been given for most of the people in this class

action, but not for the rest.
MS. MAYNARD:

What happens to the case?

It seems to me that you hold that

12

-- that the procedures here are adequate because -- under

13

the Due Process Clause because in the broad range of

14

cases, you're going to have sufficient notice and an

15

opportunity to contest.

understand the nature of the decision issued here.

their expertise in an area that this Court has repeatedly

said prison officials get a wide range of deference.

It's

Again, I would like to make a point about the

this, somebody determined that he was a gang leader

2

because the people who were being targeted at that time

were gang leaders.

Now, if you take a man and say, come before a

Well, what's -- what's

Because -I mean, if he can --

if he's not a gang leader, he can tell them why he isn't.

13

MR. LOBEL:

He'll say I'm not a gang leader.

14

But if they know and the reason is because he was involved

15

in this fight, which -- in which he didn't fight back, he

16

should be able to then say, well, this guy -- you're

wrong.

he's been an enemy of mine.

And the question is, do you have to give them
And that's all the district court

And really, all they have to do is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there is -- isn't there

the problem -- at least Ohio suggested that there is --

10

that if this person is indeed a gang leader and the form

11

says so-and-so and so-and-so effectively ratted on you,

12

those persons who came forward might not live to see

13

another day?

14

MR. LOBEL:

And the district court ordered what

15

Ohio does in all its disciplinary proceedings, what the

16

Federal Government does in its disciplinary proceedings,

17

which is if it's confidential information, you don't have

18

to turn it over because they understand that, Justice

19

Ginsburg.

20

The district court understood that.
But in Mr. Roe's case, it wasn't confidential

21

that he was hit over the head.

22

it wasn't confidential that they said to him, you were

23

present at some fight and they didn't tell who he was

24

fighting and they never were -- they never gave him any of

25

the -- the details so -- to be able to respond.

Or in Mr. Thompson's case,

statement of the policy, made the judgment that it's not

found.

they would give the person notice of one reason --

Vague notice.

The other thing they would do is

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, let -- you keep talking

about what happened in the past, and I'm -- I find some

difficulty with that because we're being asked to review a

new policy.

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I think I've got your point.

3

Tell me if I -- I mean, I've now looked at -- this is very

4

confusing to me.

5

if you look at page 22, that's the new policy.

I'm sure it's my fault.

6

MR. LOBEL:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I take it,

Exactly.
And what the new policy says

8

is, committee, you must give the prisoner some

9

information.

Then it refers to form 2598.

10

the form on page 58.

11

MR. LOBEL:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

about the facts.

14

Period.

15
16

Form 2598 is

Exactly.
What that tells him is nothing

That tells him he's been charged.

MR. LOBEL:

He's been charged for being a gang

leader.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, the new policy goes on to

18

say, the classification committee shall document

19

information presented by staff and the inmate which is

20

form 2627 and 2628.

21

but 2698 are all those pages with the information.

22
23
24
25

And I don't know where 2698 fits in,

MR. LOBEL:

And they don't have to give that to

anybody.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And it just doesn't say

anything about them at all.

Then they promulgated a new

MR. LOBEL:

facially invalid.

you could --

And that is why it's

But if you look at what was happening,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

never given to the inmate.

That's -- that's not adequate.

Well, I can understand that

you could come on behalf of a prisoner on an as-applied

if there are specific incidents where something was

the form?

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

10

It's -Well, why does the Due

Process Clause require reasons?

11

MR. LOBEL:

Even in Salerno, the -- the -- this

process, that you give the person the reason --

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. LOBEL:

you want, but they will administer this new policy in

the pre-new policy procedures were deficient and the trial

policies as remedies for past wrongs that were

That's one way to look at the case.

11

MR. LOBEL:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's certainly one way.
Another way to look at the

13

case is to say that Ohio admitted that there were some

improprieties, showed its new policy, and the case turned

on the adequacy of the new policies.

different things.

MR. LOBEL:

Well, they are ongoing at trial.

2

When the trial judge renders his decision, they're

3

ongoing.

4

it's not a question of in the abstract is it okay, but in

5

the abstract will it cure the problems.

6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Why -- why isn't it a

question of as facially in the abstract is it okay?

8
9

The question then is looking at this abstractly,

MR. LOBEL:

Yes.

Well, as I said, facially in

the abstract, I think it's not okay because I think they

10

should have final decision with reasons and notice with

11

sufficient detail for reasons.

12

But even if you don't agree with me on that, I

13

think that this case, when you have an -- when you have a

14

trial and there's a pattern and practice of -- of

15

problems, I don't think that it's proper to simply assume

16

that a piece of paper which says we'll give reasons is

17

adequate when the reasons that they're giving and that the

18

trial shows they're giving are inadequate.

19

They're -- they're shifting the ball on people.

20

and I think --

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

They're vague.
And I --

May I ask this question, Mr.

22

Lobel?

23

and so forth, were there findings that particular inmates

24

were improperly sent to this facility?

25

Putting aside for a second which policy we look at

MR. LOBEL:

There -- there were findings that --

49
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that there were -- particular inmates who were improperly

2

-- were sent with no evidence against them.

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

All right, and was there any

4

-- any order saying that inmate should get out and go to a

5

different facility?

6

MR. LOBEL:

No.

The district court simply

7

ordered that since there was a widespread showing of

8

arbitrary and capricious placement and -- and that there

9

was a showing that they built the prison for 500 -- with

10

500 cells and they didn't need 500 cells and they were

11

putting people in there who didn't need -- who didn't meet

12

the criteria that they set forward -- there was a

13

widespread showing of that.

14

should give them new hearings following a procedure which

15

would be sufficient to meet the constitutional Due Process

16

Clause.

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The district court said you

And so the State then came

18

back and said we're putting in this new policy, we will

19

give them new hearings under the new policy?

20

MR. LOBEL:

No.

The -- the State never

21

implemented the new policy.

22

should do is give them hearings, which give them notice

23

sufficient to explain what's going on, render a final

24

decision which explains what's going on, give them a

25

chance to produce witnesses if they have a -- if they have

The court said what you

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

witnesses, and they gave them hearings --

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So that even though -- if I

3

understand it correctly, even though there had findings

4

that some inmates have been improperly -- had had

5

inadequate procedure as a predicate to going into the new

6

facility, they can just stay there until the litigation is

7

over.

8
9
10

MR. LOBEL:

That's right because the district

court didn't move any particular prisoner.

But what

happened was when you --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Where do -- where do

12

we find those findings?

13

the findings about individual people?

14

MR. LOBEL:

Where in the record do we find

They're -- they're all through the

15

district court's opinion.

16

it's at 73 to 76.

17

these were cases where the district court found people are

18

being put in here on no evidence or essentially no

19

evidence.

20

If you want to look at Mr. Roe,

Mr. Thompson is at 77 to 79.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All of

And as -- and as to those

21

prisoners, was there a requirement that the -- that the

22

court's procedures be made applicable and so there would

23

have to be a retroactive hearing as to those prisoners?

24
25

MR. LOBEL:

For all the prisoners.

Several --

several months later, there were new hearings.

And what

51
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

happened then was that the amount of prisoners at this

2

prison went from 330 to where it is right now, which is

3

48, the same in the Federal control -- as in the Federal

4

control unit.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:
on the other issue?

7

MR. LOBEL:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Can you just give me 1 minute

We're talking about 48 prisoners.
Can you tell us on -- on the

liberty interest where we started with the --

10

MR. LOBEL:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
-- with the Attorney General,

12

is there a liberty interest in not being transferred from

13

prison 1 -- level 1 to level 2 --

14

MR. LOBEL:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16

No.
-- level 2, that sort of

thing?

17

Why is it that there's a liberty interest in

18

being transferred -- I guess being transferred from 4 to

19

5?

20

MR. LOBEL:

We argued here that this was an

21

atypical, significant hardship compared not to level 1, 2,

22

3, or 4, but compared to the segregation units, any other

23

prison in Ohio, even the segregation units, and for three

24

reasons, all of which in combination the court of -- the

25

district court held required a finding of liberty

interest.

2

One, it's long-term, indefinite.

There were

3

over 200 people here who were there for almost as long as

4

the building was open, and there was no reason to believe

5

that they were ever going to get out.

6

That's very different than Sandin's 30-day disciplinary

7

confinement.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

least annual review.

10

MR. LOBEL:

It was indefinite.

I thought there -- there was at

Isn't -- wasn't there an annual -There was an annual review, but the

11

committee that they set up to review it, made up not of

12

law professors, but made up of correctional officials,

13

said --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. LOBEL:

17

And a good thing too.

And a good thing, I agree.

I would

-- I would hate to be doing this.

18

But made up of wardens and deputy wardens, said

19

Mr. Roe, there's no reason you should be here, you should

20

get out.

21

Mr. Roe never knew, which the committee never knew -- the

22

committee thought Mr. Roe was in there for one reason, and

23

it turned out on trial he was in there for another reason.

24

The classification chief says to him -- says, you're going

25

to stay here another year.

And then based on reasons and evidence, which

Mr. Roe goes back, has a perfect record, does

2

every program he can do.

3

The committee says, Mr. Roe, you should get out of here

4

again.

5

sorry, for no reason I'm just going to keep you here.

6

at that point you say, well, Mr. Roe, you may be here for

7

the rest of your life, and there's no -- this is not

8

definite like in the control unit where --

What does the new policy say

about this?

16

He comes back to the committee.

Nothing.
Nothing about --

Nothing.
-- about the annual review.

It says you get an annual review.

They got an annual review.

The new policy doesn't say.

And what the district court ordered was

18

draconian, that the classification chief, after he does

19

this, without hearing from the inmate, without giving him

20

reasons, has to write a final decision, which gives him

21

some of the reasons that Mr. Roe is being kept there, and

22

that they have to tell him, like they told the prisoners

23

in -- in Greenholtz, what you have to do to get out.

24

-- and that doesn't seem to me unreasonable.

25

have to do is give a one-paragraph reason.

the first reason, but that's not the only reason.
The State officials testified that this was

3

qualitatively different than any other prisoner, that the

4

level of restriction, the no outdoor recreation for many

5

years, that people have not been outside for years, the

6

small cell with solid steel doors so that they could not

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Did they have reading

I --

MR. LOBEL:

They had reading materials, yes,

12

Your Honor, and they had televisions so they could watch

13

their favorite programs.

14

But they had nobody to talk to.

And we -- the

15

experiment that was done with long-term solitary

16

confinement, which this Court itself in the 1890's found

17

caused people to go crazy -- if you have to give people

18

the process that was required here to send the prisoner to

19

a mental institution, you should have to give them at

20

least that process to send them into a situation which is

21

going to send them to the mental institution.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. LOBEL:

And that's what's involved here.

24

It's a qualitatively different type of experience.

25

the Seventh Circuit in U.S. v. Johnson said you cannot

It's not the 30 days in

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. PETRO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. PETRO:

9

It has been pointed out that -- that inmates

Thank you, Your Honor.

10

stay in the prison for many years, but in reality, over

11

600 inmates since the opening of -- of Ohio State

12

penitentiary in 1998 -- over 600 inmates have gone into

13

level 5 and over 550 inmates have left level 5.

14

the classification process is an ongoing process.

15

And so

It is now established under an order of the

16

district court, but we submit, Your Honors, that the new

17

policy that was presented in 2002 at the time this case

18

was pending trial, was a policy that provided a process

19

which was the best type of process for a predictive

20

decision.

21

making of -- of prison officials in seeking to protect the

22

safety and security of the prison.

23

This Court has often deferred to the decision-

And in this instance, the policy that was put in

24

place and the hearing process, without actually having

25

essentially a fact-finding process, which is what the

57
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

court has imposed on this process, was the kind of process

2

that allows for prison officials to review a whole variety

3

of additional information even beyond what might be

4

evidentiary.

5

When we think about the conditions in the prison

6

where the inmate is currently housed, if they're at the

7

Lucasville penitentiary in level 4 -- and the conditions

8

there are particularly volatile -- the prison officials

9

need to have the flexibility to make a decision on

10

placement in level 5 not only to protect this inmate but

11

to protect the institution itself and the safety of the

12

inmates and the safety, of course, of -- of the personnel

13

that work at the facility.

14

In the Mathews test, which was applied both by

15

the district court and by the court of appeals, there is

16

clearly an acknowledgement that the interest of the

17

government is very strong.

18

Mathews test, there's a recognition that additional

19

procedures really add no value to the decision-making

20

process.

21

But in the second step of the

Here the -- the government needs to have the

22

capacity and the -- the ability to make the best possible

23

decision looking at a whole variety of factors, and to

24

have a procedure put in place by the court that requires a

25

full display of all the evidence that will be presented at

58
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

the time of hearing, as incorporated in the notice to the

2

inmate that a hearing will be held, and then an

3

acknowledgement that there's -- only this evidence is the

4

evidence that -- that is being relied upon really presents

5

essentially a fact-finding hearing where the hearing

6

process that is set forth in New Policy 111-07 is more

7

than just fact-finding.
