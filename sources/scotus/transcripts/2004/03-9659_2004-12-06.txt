Mr. Waxman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
In Hernandez v. New York, this Court explained

11

that there are exceptional cases in which the totality of

12

evidence surrounding jury selection is so strong that a

13

finding of no discrimination is simply too incredible to

14

be accepted by this Court.

15

a case in which even on collateral review, the sheer

16

weight of the mutually reinforcing evidence renders

17

objectively unreasonable the State court's conclusion that

18

race did not motivate even one of the prosecution's

19

peremptory strikes.

20

This is that exceptional case,

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Do we have to find that the

21

strike of at least one African American prospective juror

22

was race-based for you to prevail?

23

MR. WAXMAN:

I believe so.

You have to find,

24

Justice O'Connor, that race was the but-for factor or the

25

tipping factor, not the only factor, but the but-for

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

factor for at least one to come within the four corners of

2

Batson.

3

Now, I could argue I think, if I needed to in

4

this case, that the jury shuffle evidence alone, which is

5

an unexplained, blatantly race-based means of racially

6

excluding jurors from the venire, comes within Batson, the

7

Batson proscription itself, or I could argue that case

8

too.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Were there any -- were there

10

any State decisions, or Federal court decisions for that

11

matter, justifying the shuffle on the grounds of -- I

12

don't know -- professional class versus working class or

13

something like that?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

The State has in its brief in this

15

case, on this trip to the Court -- the State has cited the

16

Court to one other case in which the Court of Criminal

17

Appeals acknowledged the State's justification in that

18

case, that it shuffled because there was a member of the

19

probation office in the front row that they didn't want to

20

embarrass and that jurors in the front had tended more to

21

have ties than jurors in the back.

22

never claimed in this case.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That is -- that was

We have, from the very -Were there -- were there any

24

State court cases said that -- or even in that case you're

25

referring to -- that the shuffle usually is race-based?

MR. WAXMAN:

called Ladd v. State.

3

some reasonably substantial Law Review commentary in the

4

State of Texas.

5

Houston Law Review or the Houston Bar Review when I was

6

here last time, and there has since been one in the St.

7

Mary's Law Review that says this is a procedure that is

8

used to discriminate on the basis of visual preference.

9

You know, I can't -- the case is
There is -- there's some -- now

I cited the Court to -- to one in the

And what's particularly interesting about it in

10

this case is there was a contemporaneous objection in week

11

12

based on race, and the State offered no defense at the

13

time.

14

hearing.

15

district judge, the Fifth Circuit, in this Court or below,

16

and now in this Court this time it says, well, there's

17

this other case in which the reason given was that we

18

didn't want to embarrass the probation officer and we

19

didn't -- and we had people who had ties in the front row.

20

There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that would

21

justify those excuses here.

22

It offered no defense in the subsequent Batson
It had no explanation before the magistrate, the

And the evidence in the -- the only evidence in

23

the record that seems to me compels the conclusion that

24

this was done for the deliberate purpose of minimizing the

25

number of African Americans on the jury.

And it was done

5

Washington, DC 20005

1

by prosecutors, each of whom -- there were two prosecutors

2

in this case, each of whom was found to have violated

3

Batson in criminal -- other criminal trials

4

contemporaneous with this one.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -

And the -- and the Fifth

6

Circuit's answer to the jury shuffle was, well, the

7

defense shuffled more times, as I -

8

MR. WAXMAN:

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

MR. WAXMAN:

The Fifth -- as I recall.

The -- the Fifth Circuit said that

11

we -- that they shuffled twice and we shuffled five times.

12

Now, that is both factually wrong and legally irrelevant.

13

They shuffled three times and they tried to shuffle a four

14

times -- a fourth time because, the Court will perhaps

15

recall -- this was discussed in the Court's last opinion

16

-- because they waived in the fourth week.

17

shuffled -- the defense then shuffled and they tried to

18

come in and back -- back and shuffle again when a number

19

of African Americans were advanced in the order.

20

The defense

There -- under this Court's Batson

21

jurisprudence, the proscription against using peremptory

22

strikes for a racial purpose or a gender-based purpose is

23

proscribed to the defense, as well as the prosecution, but

24

there -- the one doesn't excuse the other, and there has

25

never been a claim, nor is there a factual predicate laid

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in this case for a claim, that Mr. Miller-El's trial

2

lawyers were doing the same.

3

would not justify what they did.

4

Now --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even if it were true, it

If -- if we find or if there

6

is a finding that the -- that the attempted shuffle on

7

this fifth try was race-based, does that win your case,

8

even though the shuffle didn't take place?

9

MR. WAXMAN:

10

Well, it was the -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, does it show the

11

necessary animus so that it carries through the whole

12

case?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

I think, if I needed to -- I mean,

14

we -- we've argued that the shuffle, just like the race

15

coding of the cards in the pre-Batson era, the disparate

16

questioning on minimum punishment and the graphic script,

17

all reinforce what we think the record shows with respect

18

to each of the six peremptory strikes that we challenge

19

But if we didn't have that, Justice Kennedy, I

20

would be here arguing that if I could show a single strike

21

that was made for the purpose of eliminating African

22

Americans from being considered for jury service, that

23

that ought to come within this Court's proscription of

24

Batson.

25

because I don't think we need that freestanding claim.

Now, we haven't made that freestanding claim

1

The jury shuffle is a practice that exists only

2

in the State of Texas and, to my understanding, has ever

3

existed only in the State of Texas.

4

very peculiar phenomenon, but I think I could make the

5

argument that, look, even if there weren't any of these

6

six -- let's say they shuffled it so successfully that no

7

African Americans came up.

Americans out of the 108 who were questioned.

generous reading of Batson.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Waxman, we really have to

12

examine your -- you know, your allegations, I suppose, one

13

at a time.

14

It makes it a very complicated case.

The -- the State's response to -- to your

15

argument that two of -- of the State's attorneys involved

16

in this case had been found to have made racially based

17

strikes in the past -- the State's response to that is

18

that that was not part of the evidence presented in State

19

court, and therefore, it -- it is not a proper

20

consideration in reviewing the State court decision.

21

-- what is your response to that?

22

MR. WAXMAN:

I think that's wrong.

What

I think it's

23

wrong, first of all, because those two cases had been

24

decided by the Court of Criminal Appeals at the time it

25

considered the Batson claim in this case.

challenging the -- the strikes to bring -- bring that to

the attention of the court.

MR. WAXMAN:

My goodness, no.

My goodness.

Even -- I understand your argument.

I can't tell you for sure -- and I don't believe anybody

16

can -- whether those cases were or weren't argued before

prosecutors, Mr. Macaluso in the other Miller-El -- in the

Chambers case and Mr. Nelson in Mrs. Miller-El's case.

18

Mr. Macaluso and Mr. Nelson alternated the voir

And interestingly, what the Texas Court of

19

Criminal Appeals said with respect to Mr. Macaluso in the

20

Chambers case is not only that he removed five out of five

21

African Americans for reasons that violate Batson, but the

22

Texas Court of Criminal Appeals also noted that he was

23

using the same minimum punishment ploy that he used in

24

this case in order to disqualify African American jurors.

25

He -- the court actually goes and says, you know, with

three of these people, the State tried to disqualify them

2

by asking them an open-ended question about what they

3

thought the minimum punishment should be even though

4

that's usually what the defense is concerned about.

5

Precisely what happened in this case.

6

Now, I'm not suggesting, Justice Scalia, that

7

our case depends upon the -- this 404(b) evidence or not,

8

and I think it's quite --

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

I mean, that's the problem.

We've got to go through each one of them one by one.

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I And -- and I'm -- you know, I

13

don't remember the names of people involved in -- in prior

cases in this Court.

MR. WAXMAN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17
18

Justice -- you had this same officer

before you, my goodness, I -- I wouldn't remember it.
MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, a -- first of all,

19

these -- each of these cases was tried within months of

20

Mr. Miller-El's case, and a finding by a -- the State's

21

highest court that a prosecutor has engaged in

22

intentional, deliberate, race discrimination in the

23

selection of a jury I respectfully submit -- I certainly

24

hope is not the kind of everyday finding that is easily

25

forgotten.

Washington, DC 20005

1

But in any event, you -- yes.

You have to go

2

through all of the evidence in the case, and what the

3

evidence in the case shows is that, first of all, as this

4

Court observed the last time it was here, the State's

5

proper race-neutral rationales for striking African

6

American jurors pertains just as well to white jurors who

7

were not challenged and who did serve.

8
9

It's -- you also have to look at the race-coding
of the cards, race-coding that was done by prosecutors

10

whom this Court observed last time were trained in an

11

office culture suffused with bias against African

12

Americans in jury selection.

13

And you also have to look at, with respect, the

14

remarkable disparity in the way in which African American

15

and white venire members were questioned, both with

16

respect to minimum punishment -

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

18

MR. WAXMAN:

20

May I -

-- and with respect to the graphic

script.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask on the minimum

21

punishment ploy?

22

any of -- of the trial judges ever grant a -- a challenge

23

for cause on the basis of the use of the minimum

24

punishment ploy?

25

Did that ever work in this case or did

Well, I can't speak to other cases.

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

But what's truly remarkable about this case -- I

2

mean, there are many things that are truly remarkable

3

about this case -- the State not only used this minimum

4

punishment ploy with 90 -- 7 out of 8 of the African

5

Americans, as opposed to only 2 out of 36 of the whites,

6

but it actually tried to remove 2 of the African Americans

the juror that, well, it's 5 years and you're not saying

2

that you couldn't possibly consider 5 years.

3

that was true with respect to white jurors as well as

4

African American jurors.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- and

The respondent's reply to this

6

-- this minimal punishment argument is that in fact the -

7

the two white prospective jurors who had -- who had

8

expressed antagonism towards the death penalty were

9

subjected to the same questioning, and that the seven out

10

of eight black prospective jurors were seven who had

11

expressed antagonism to the death penalty.

12

not true?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Now, is that

I think that if I -- I believe that

14

with respect to minimum punishment, as opposed to the

15

graphic script, what the State is saying is last time we

16

said there were 10 whites and 10 blacks who expressed

17

hesitation.

18

only two of the whites got it.

19

that says, well, the other eight were all either struck

20

for cause or by consent.

21

least two reasons.

22

And this Court observed that, well, yes, but
Now, they filed a brief

Now, that's -- that fails for at

One, they identified 10.

In this Court and

23

below, we identified 19 jurors who absolutely expressed

24

hesitation about the death penalty, and they have still

25

not accounted for them.

Number one.

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Number two, with respect to the eight who they

2

have accounted for in their brief, the fact that at the

3

very end of voir dire, they were struck for cause, or

4

there was an agreement at the end of voir dire to remove

5

them hardly provides a reason not to give the minimum

6

punishment ploy to jurors who fit the categorization that

7

the State has described.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, we have to go through

each one of them and see if the degree of hostility

10

expressed by the white jurors was the same as the degree

11

of hostility expressed by the black jurors.

12

the degree of hostility by the black jurors was quite

13

high.

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, in the context of

2

all of this other evidence, which is the context in which

3

you need to weigh it and determine whether we have

4

satisfied the stringent standard for review that applies,

5

I respectfully submit that if you go through the -- the

6

voir dire questioning of Mr. Fields and Mr. Warren and Mr.

7

Rand and the others that we've mentioned, and compare it,

8

even leaving aside all of the other evidence,

9

contemporaneous evidence, of race discrimination in the

10

jury selection in this case, I think you will have to come

11

to the conclusion that race was a but-for factor in these

12

cases.

13

In Mr. Fields -- we've -- we've mentioned him in

14

our -- we've described him at length in our brief.

that comparison has to be taken in the context of not one,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

a different way and more intensively, that alone suffices

even though the questioning in each case disclosed the

there's no plausible explanation available on the evidence

disparate questioning, which there is not in the

If there is a plausible explanation for

But here, we have, in addition to the disparate

11

questioning that is not susceptible to a race-neutral

12

explanation -- we have things like the prosecutor's own

notations in the -- in the questionnaires.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Waxman, you were dealing

15

with Fields, and the answer in Fields' case that the

16

prosecution gives is he had a strong feeling about

17

rehabilitation, and so he was -- he thought that everyone

18

could be rehabilitated -- rehabilitated.

19

he wasn't like others who didn't entertain those doubts

20

about rehabilitation.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

So that shows he -

Yes, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg.

22

He -- he expressed an opinion that he thought that people

23

could be rehabilitated, not as strong as those opinions by

24

juror -- white Juror Hearn and white Juror Duke who sat.

25

But in Fields' case, he was absolutely unequivocal --

1

-- I'm referring the Court to page 185 of the joint

2

appendix -- absolutely unequivocal that the ability or

3

propensity for rehabilitation would not affect his

4

willingness to -- to put in the death penalty.

5

in the dissenting and concurring opinions in this case

6

last time with respect to Mr. Fields, it was pointed out

7

that he was a supporter of the death penalty who could put

8

in the death penalty.

9

I believe

And what's interesting about Fields is if you

10

look at the transcript pages where the prosecutor

11

justifies the strike, on page 197 of the joint appendix,

12

the prosecutor says, well, he was -- he -- he -- I -- he

13

-- he said something about rehabilitation, and it goes on.

14

And then two pages later -- they have a discussion about

something -- a discussion about which questionnaires will

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. WAXMAN:

The -- the juror cards are in the

lists the gender and race, even the cards as to jurors

that they never questioned.

at the time the venires were called.

So we know that these were

manual that said don't take minorities, don't take Jews,

don't take women, don't take fat people -- people who have

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENA BUNN

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

16
17
18

MS. BUNN:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
The big picture.

The majority of African

19

Americans summoned for jury duty in this case were either

20

opposed to the death penalty generally or unwilling to

21

impose it, while the majority of white jurors had no

22

qualms about the death penalty.

23

jurors based on their case-related views which, after the

24

fact, correlate with race is not unconstitutional.

25

Striking prospective

Essentially, though Miller-El has presented this

23
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case as one of disparate treatment, it is actually one of

2

disparate impact.

3

I will discuss first -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Would -- would the statement

4

that you gave -- let's assume there was a -- a working

5

premise that blacks were more -- were less inclined to

6

impose the death penalty.

7

intensive questioning of every black juror?

8
9

MS. BUNN:

Would that alone justify more

No, Your Honor, it would not.

And

the record in this case actually does not support that

10

that -- does not support a proposition that black jurors

11

were questioned differently.

12

minimum -- the questioning on the graphic script.

13

six challenged jurors in this case, only two received the

14

graphic -- graphic script at the outset of their voir

15

dire, Carrol Boggess and -- and Wayman Kennedy, both of

16

whom had answered the questions in their juror

17

questionnaire indicating ambiguity regarding their views

18

on the death penalty regarding their support for the death

19

penalty.

20

Most significantly, the
Of the

This fact JUSTICE BREYER:

Now -- now, as I understand it,

21

this case was here before.

22

through it, and as a result of that, I -- if I read the

23

opinion -- not the dissent, but the majority opinion -

24

and it might be in my interest if people followed dissents

25

more, but I think the law is we follow the majority

We all read this and we went

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

1
2

opinion.
So when I read the majority opinion, I read,

3

number one, there was history in this county, at least 7

4

years earlier though, where they actually had a booklet

5

which said let's keep all the African Americans out,

6

here's how you do it.

7

Then you had jury shuffling, which were two

8

instances.

9

my mind, you know, we have rows.

In one of them, there are like 40 people.

In

In row 1 there are four

10

black jurors and six white; row 2, three black and seven

11

white; row 3, two black and in the last row one black, and

12

the prosecution says, hey, let's shuffle it.

13

And the other time he did it, the only other time -- it

14

wasn't quite that bad -- the same idea.

15

All right?

Then the third thing that comes up is you find

16

instances here -- not everyone, absolutely right -- but

17

instances where black people who seemed really for the

18

death penalty, say, like Mr. Fields manages to get knocked

19

off, but Mrs. Mazza who seems quite uncertain is kept on.

20

And then we have this disparate questioning that

21

you're about to mention where it just turns out that

22

almost every black is given this really -- you know, bring

23

them in a gurney, put -- put -- you know, real graphic

24

description of the death penalty, and white people who

25

also expressed hesitation aren't.

Okay?

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

So on the basis of that, the majority writes

2

there is, indeed, a strong suspicion here that this was

3

discrimination.

4

write something like that -- I didn't write the words, but

5

I would mean, well, I think that's what it is unless

6

there's something later on that comes out to the contrary.

7

So I'm asking you what was to the contrary.

8

in this Fifth Circuit that we didn't have in front of us

9

the last time?

10

So I want to ask you -- and if I were to

MS. BUNN:

What came out

Your Honor, the first time before

11

this Court, the issue was whether, based on a threshold

12

examination of the record -

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that was the issue, but

14

I'm saying if I read the opinion to say -- now, maybe

15

you'll tell me I shouldn't.

16

redo what we did.

17

well, unless something changes here, this is bad.

18

discriminatory.

19

read the opinion that way.

20

want to be sure that that's what's in front of me.

21

want to know is there something different in the Fifth

22

Circuit that wasn't here the first time.

23

We should just go back and

But I'm reading the opinion to say,
It's

Now, you can tell me, one, I'm wrong to

MS. BUNN:

I got that argument.

But I
So I

Your Honor, I believe the most -- the

24

most important difference in the review of this Court the

25

last time and the review of this -- of the Court this time

26
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

is that the Court did take a big-picture look at all of

2

the pieces of evidence, but at this point, as the court of

3

appeals did and as this -- as this Court must do now, it

4

must go, as Justice Scalia mentioned, juror by juror, the

5

jurors who were challenged.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Miller-El -

We only speak to the issues

7

before us, don't we?

8

was not the issue before us here.

9

there was enough evidence to require the issuance of a

10

COA.

And the issue before us last time
It was simply whether

Isn't that right?

11

MS. BUNN:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's a good deal

That is correct.
That's why I asked.

14

different.

15

other issues, it certainly was not binding on the court of

16

appeals, was it?

Whatever the majority might have said about

17

MS. BUNN:

18

JUSTICE STEVENS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

I hate to say this So that must be a different

question -

21
22

No, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

-- to my colleagues, but I'm

very much interested in hearing what Ms. Bunn has to say.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- because that wasn't the one

24

I asked.

25

understand that point, which we could say it was

The one I wanted answered was the question of I

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

definitely not definite the last time.

2

it's a serious question -- as whether there was something

3

new or different that came up when the Fifth Circuit wrote

4

this.

5

and if the answer is yes, I want you to say what it is

6

because I'm interested.

7

I'm asking you -

Now, I gathered from your answer, it might be yes,

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor, there was additional

8

analysis, particularly of the six jurors Miller-El claims

9

were discriminated against, which this Court did not

10

review the first -- in its first opinion specifically.

11

And a review of Miller-El's purposeful discrimination

12

claim must focus on these six jurors.

13

And given the -- the views expressed by these

14

six veniremen, it is no surprise that prosecutors struck

15

them.

16

had voiced views unfavorable to the State but were not

17

subject to a challenge for cause.

18

neutral, case-related, and supported by the record, in

19

fact, supported by the very words that the jurors uttered.

20

Each venire member peremptorily struck by the State

These reasons are race-

two questions just generally.

answer to my question to -- to Mr. Waxman.

that I'm aware of in Texas where the State did challenge

Whether there was any questioning

10

apparent from the records.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

But have -- and the challenges

13

MS. BUNN:

Of course, none of them were

Is that right?

16

MS. BUNN:

17

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's correct.
So it -- it was true that this

18

was -- was a ploy adopted for the purpose of trying to

19

make it unnecessary to use a -- a peremptory challenge.

20
21

MS. BUNN:

24
25

Yes, Your Honor,

that is right.

22
23

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And do you defend that

practice?
MS. BUNN:

Yes, if it is a legitimate tactic,

recognized -- as an attorney, if there is a -- some means

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

1

that is available to use so that you do not have to use a

2

peremptory strike -

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If you -- if you can get the

4

venire person to make a mistake in his answer, then you -

5

you get -- get him off easy.

6

MS. BUNN:

That's what -- that's what voir dire

7

is all about, and the defense counsel did it in many

8

occasions -

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And suppose -- suppose you

10

have a system in which that attempt to find cause is

11

applied much more rigorously to black prospective jurors

12

than to white prospective jurors.

13

MS. BUNN:

If it's not -- the record shows that

14

there's no difference in the views expressed by the

15

jurors, yes.

16

In this case that -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

The -- the white jurors

17

don't express the views at all because they're not

18

questioned intensively, so you don't know if there's cause

19

for them or not.

20

intensively, and you find cause or -- or a -- a race-

21

neutral reason for the dismissal.

22

violation in -- in that instance?

23
24
25

But the black jurors are questioned

MS. BUNN:
violation.

Is there a Batson

No, Your Honor, not a Batson

Now, whether it's evidence of -- of -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So -- so you say that in any

30
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case you can question black jurors more intensively than

2

white jurors and still succeed in excusing them if the

3

result of that voir dire shows some race-neutral basis.

4

MS. BUNN:

Your Honor, if the questioning itself

5

results in the views that are the basis of the strike,

6

that would present a problem.

7

however, where the -- the disparate questioning on minimum

8

sentencing, for instance, was based on the views that were

9

expressed.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That is not the case here,

Suppose -- suppose you have a

11

manual of -- from the district attorney's office that says

12

all black jurors shall be questioned more intensively than

13

white jurors.

14
15
16

MS. BUNN:

That would certainly be evidence that

black jurors and white jurors were treated differently.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

what happened here.

18

MS. BUNN:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're saying that that is not

Yes.
It was on the basis of the

20

questionnaires expressing hostility to the death penalty

21

that more intensive questioning was given to some people

22

than to others, and that the mere fact that a larger

23

number of those people was black is not a violation.

24

MS. BUNN:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Your Honor, that is correct.
So the hypothetical, assuming

31
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

that you -- you just have blacks and whites with no

2

difference in -- in what they -- in what they had said on

3

the questionnaire, is a hypothetical that you say does not

4

exist in this case.

5

MS. BUNN:

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes.
Yes, but you don't know what

7

the questionnaire showed as to most of the white venire

8

persons, do you?

9
10

MS. BUNN:

No, we don't, Your Honor.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

11

persons were there?

And so are we to assume that

19

all 46 of the other white venire persons were as tough on

20

the death penalty as you'd like everybody to be?

21

MS. BUNN:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, Your Honor.
We just don't know about those

other 46, do we?

MS. BUNN:

even though we do not know -

5

That is -- we do not know.

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't know.

There -

If you don't

know, you -- there's an excellent way to know.

7

says, you know, Mr. Prosecutor, you gave this terribly

8

graphic script to all the black people and you really

9

didn't give it to hardly any of the white people.

Somebody

Now,

10

it's also possible -- possible -- that the reason he

11

didn't was because from the answer to their

12

questionnaires, which we've not seen, you didn't need to.

13

That's possible.

14

have said to the judge, Judge, that's why I did it.

because of the culture of discrimination in the manuals

MS. BUNN:

cannot trump the State court's finding of no purposeful

It does not address -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

there a reasonable basis to think that these particular

individuals, engaging in the practice that they

10

demonstrably engaged in, had had a change in heart in this

case?

12

MS. BUNN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The record in this

case indicates that -- for instance, with the use of

graphic script questioning, the -- of the six -- again, of

exercise of a jury shuffle.

-- what -- what Miller-El is asking this Court is to

There was no objection made, no

been the basis for the State's exercise of a jury shuffle

is race, and that is not -- that is not the case.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

that's his argument at all.

15

peremptory strikes.

18

is is very strong circumstantial evidence that what tipped

19

the prosecutors to make the peremptory challenges here -

20

what he was referring to earlier in this argument as the

21

but-for cause was racial.

He's not saying nothing else

22

could have been involved.

He was saying race tipped it.

that indicates that race does.

unsound?

4

MS. BUNN:

Your Honor, again, Miller-El's claim

5

of purposeful discrimination must focus on these six

6

jurors, and in answer to your question, a review of these

7

six jurors does show that these strikes were not based on

race.

Your Honor, the -- that was not the

prosecutor's argument at trial and it's -- it is not our

position now that -

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

They then said

10

that oh, you see, Mr. Fields was -- is it a woman or a

11

man?

12

kept off, the black man, because of his views on

13

rehabilitation.

14

that consists of his saying -- my -- my interpretation -

15

well, I think any person, if he really believes in God,

16

really believes in God, could be rehabilitated.

17

point the prosecutor says to him, well, suppose you came

18

to the conclusion that Miller-El really was touched by

19

God, could you put him to death?

20

Because, well, it seems to me my job here is to follow the

I'm not sure.

11

they've done, is beyond rehabilitation.

12

rehabilitation that no one, white or black, had expressed.
