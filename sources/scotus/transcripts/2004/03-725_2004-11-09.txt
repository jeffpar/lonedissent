ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURA W. BRILL

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

10

MS. BRILL:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
There are five primary reasons why this

11

prosecution is outside the scope of anything Congress has

12

authorized.

13

wire fraud statute is inconsistent with the revenue rule.

14

Second, it turns the rule of lenity on its head by

15

allowing the Government to incarcerate petitioners for 57

16

months for conduct that has never given rise to civil

17

liability in this country.

18

contravenes our national policy of demanding reciprocity

19

in matters of international tax enforcement.

20

Government acknowledged below that it cannot bring this

21

prosecution without disregarding another act of Congress,

22

the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act, which is, as the

23

name specifies, mandatory.

24

decisions in McNally and Cleveland, the wire fraud statute

25

applies only to schemes aimed at defrauding a victim into

relinquishing something that it holds as money or

2

property.

3

claim is neither money nor property.

4

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

A sovereign's interest in an unassessed tax

Well, can you look at the

5

interest of the Government as one of not allowing U.S.

6

territory to be used to carry out a smuggling scheme?

7

mean, why does it have to be viewed as one of trying to

8

enforce some other nation's tax laws?

9

MS. BRILL:

I

Justice O'Connor, the government's

10

interest in prosecuting somebody does not define the scope

11

of what the statute at issue proscribes.

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

It's a wire fraud statute

13

dealing with the use of communications capacity in this

14

country to carry out a scheme designed to enable smuggling

15

of goods.

16

MS. BRILL:

Well, if the -- if the statute was

17

not written as it is -- the statute, as written, uses the

18

words "defraud" and the word -- the word "property," and

19

both of those terms are terms that this Court has defined

20

very narrowly.

21

In Nader, it defined a "fraud" as -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Brill, I thought your brief

22

said that we have an anti-smuggling statute, which is

23

directed precisely against smugglers, but it only applies

24

to those countries that have similar protection for us.

25

MS. BRILL:

Yes, Justice -

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MS. BRILL:

3

And Canada does not.

Yes, Justice Scalia, that's exactly

correct.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The existence of that

5

statute would seem to suggest -- and a statute which is

6

limited to countries that will do the same for us -- would

7

seem to suggest that we don't want to do this for Canada.

8
9

MS. BRILL:

exactly right, Your Honor.

10
11

Yes, that's exactly -- that's
There -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
vessels.

But it's also limited to

It's smuggling by water, not smuggling by -

12

MS. BRILL:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

By automobile.
-- vehicles, as was done here,

14

so that we don't have any statute that covers smuggling on

15

land.

16
17
18

MS. BRILL:

Right.

Yes, Your Honor, that's

correct.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there something better about

19

reciprocity for vessels and not reciprocity for land

20

smuggling?

21

MS. BRILL:

I think it just evinces what

22

Congress was concerned about most at the time, Justice

23

Scalia, but it was -- it is certainly the case that in any

24

-- any time that this country has endeavored to deal with

25

matters of international tax enforcement, it has always

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

demanded reciprocity.

2

smuggling statute, it has done so through the numerous tax

3

treaties that the Second Circuit's RJR decision discusses

4

at length.

It has done so through the

5

And one of the points the RJR decision makes is

6

that, in 1951, at the very time that Congress was looking

7

at the wire fraud statute and enacting it, the Senate was,

8

at the same time, becoming concerned that this country had

9

gone too far in extending reciprocity in connection with

10

its tax treaties and was actually evincing a policy of

11

cutting back on the degree to which we would assist other

12

countries in tax enforcement.

13

And so the issue is to look at -- that the

14

revenue rule must be used as a background principle of

15

common law against which -- against which the revenue -

16

excuse me, against which the wire fraud statute is -

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, if we don't view

18

this case as involving some attempt to indirectly enforce

19

Canada's tax laws -- suppose we don't view it with that

20

lens -- then does that put it outside the so-called

21

revenue -

22

MS. BRILL:

Well, if it were not -- if it did

23

not serve the function -- it doesn't matter what the

24

government's intent is and what is in the mind of the

25

prosecutor, but if it did not have any effect of enforcing

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a foreign government's revenue rule, then, yes, it would

2

be outside; but there are numerous ways in which this

3

prosecution does enforce a foreign government's revenue

4

rule.

5

sentence was based on the -- an estimate of the intended

6

loss, and there was no assessment or an adjudication in

7

Canada to determine what the amount was that was owed.

8

And so the District Court became, essentially, part of the

9

tax enforcement apparatus of the Government of Canada by

10

Certainly, it deters future violations.

The

performing that assessment in the first instance.

11

And so anytime that we impose criminal or civil

12

liability in a manner that affects the tax policies of

13

another country, we are enforcing that rule.

14

whether we're requiring compliance with the -- with the

15

tax rule of a foreign country or punishing noncompliance.

16

All of those -

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If we -

Is the rationale for the rule

18

that enforcement of taxes is so unpopular that we want to

19

minimize the exposure to -- of our judges so that they -

20

the only thing they have to do is enforce taxes that -

21

that are paid to our own Government?

22

that.

23

I'm serious about

Is that the rationale?
MS. BRILL:

Well, I think there's a certain

24

amount of self-protection in some of the decision -

25

decisions, surely; but the real -- the underlying purpose

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

of the revenue rule is a recognition that foreign -- that

2

taxes, in general, are a matter of policy.

3

inherently policy-based; they're not based on contract or

4

other kinds of commerce.

5

assist in resolving disputes between private parties.

6

often they're imposed -- especially customs duties, are

7

imposed to disadvantage other countries, and so the courts

8

have said these are a peculiar type of law, they serve

9

only the interest of the -- of the foreign sovereign, and

They're

They do not -- they do not
And

10

there's a particular -- there's been a particular

11

sensitivity about scrutinizing those foreign laws,

12

potentially declaring them invalid under the foreign

13

governments' own laws or pursuant to our own Constitution.

14

And so revenue rules have historically been a categorical

15

exclusion to general principles of comity through which we

16

might otherwise recognize foreign laws or foreign

17

judgments.

18

And the rule has come to be so entrenched, and

19

has been so well established, that there's a whole body of

20

background law in the tax treatise of our country, and of

21

many other countries, that is based on our non-recognition

22

and our non-enforcement of foreign revenue laws.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -

But if we did -- if we did

24

enforce even a tax judgment of another country, there

25

would be no U.S. law that would be violated.

You're

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

talking about a common law, no country enforces the taxes

2

of another.

3

Relations now, that's put in terms of -- there's no

4

requirement that any country enforce the tax claims or

5

judgments of another; but neither is there any

6

prohibition.

7

But, at least in the Restatement of Foreign

MS. BRILL:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the current

8

restatement is worded in -- addresses judgment

9

specifically.

It does not -- it doesn't address un

10

adjudicated tax codes.

11

greater suspicion, a much greater reluctance, to get into

12

enforcing a claim brought by a foreign country, where that

13

country's own processes have not been allowed to run their

14

course and to have the initial determination.

But there's always been a much

15

There -- the restate -- the second Restatement

16

of Foreign Relations law, which is -- was -- came out in

17

1965 and is closer to reflecting what the law was at the

18

time Congress enacted the wire fraud statute, says, in

19

Section 41, Comment L, "Under the -- under the foreign

20

relations law of the United States, courts in the United

21

States will generally refrain from taking action to give

22

effect to the penal or revenue laws of other states,

23

except as provided by international agreement."

24

that -- that was a statement by the -- by the propounders

25

of the -- of the Restatement of what they -- what they

And so

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

believed the law was at the time.
To the extent it's qualified, I think it's

3

just to leave room for the fact that the Senate can

4

promulgate treaties, or Congress can, by statute, command

5

that courts recognize these laws.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it's -

You don't -- you don't assert

7

that this -- that it -- that this couldn't be done.

8

You just -

9
10
11
12

MS. BRILL:

Not that -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- assert that we shouldn't

interpret this statute to have done it.
MS. BRILL:

Exactly, Justice Scalia.

If

13

Congress had written a different wire fraud statute that

14

had said, "You can't have a scheme to defraud the revenue,

15

whether foreign or domestic," that would have been a clear

16

statement abrogating the revenue rule.

17

any such clear statement, and the terms -- the terms

18

"defraud" and the terms "property" have to be read with

19

the background rule in mind.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we don't have

May I But you would come to that

22

conclusion even if we had a reciprocal enforcement

23

agreement.

24

reciprocal enforcement agreement, you'd come to the same

25

conclusion, no prosecution under this statute.

If this were Country X, where we did have a

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. BRILL:

Correct, Your Honor, because there

2

wouldn't -- this statute wouldn't have been written to

3

take that into account.

4

This -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, in a sense, the revenue

5

position is irrelevant to your -- to your secondary or

6

your -- or your independent argument on statutory

7

construction.

8
9

The revenue rule is irrelevant to it.

MS. BRILL:

As to just whether an unassessed tax

claim -

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

MS. BRILL:

Yes.

-- is property, the revenue rule -

12

the revenue rule adds a boost to it, but there are two -

13

there are two dimensions to the property element.

14

that, as I said -- and if a -- if a tax claim is not -

15

has not been subject to an assessment, that whatever

16

interest the Government may have in that is not in the

17

nature of property; it is simply in the nature of law-

18

enforcement power to collect.

19

revenue rule cases talk about the power to -

20
21
22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

One is

They -- some of these

So tax revenues are not

property, in your view?
MS. BRILL:

Once a tax is collected, once the

23

Government actually has money in its hands, and if there's

24

a scheme to, let's say, obtain an illegal refund through a

25

tax and -- that would be a scheme to deprive a government

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

body of money.

2

is not something that falls within the statute, separate

3

and apart from the revenue rule.

4

as a result of the revenue rule, it is also the case that

5

no state court would have recognized any property interest

6

in a foreign sovereign, even if it had reached the point

7

of a judgment.

8
9

But a scheme to merely evade paying a tax

But the revenue rule -

And so it works in both ways.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you, Ms. Brill,

something that puzzled me about this case?

10

peculiar use of our wire fraud statute.

11

proceedings going on in Canada?

12

attempt to extradite these people?

13

MS. BRILL:

The -

It is a rather

Are there any

Justice Ginsburg, there was an

14

indictment that Canada issued against the Petitioners.

15

has charges under -- for smuggling, under Canadian law,

16

which is Customs Act, Section 159.

possession of imported spirits under Excise Act 163(1)(b),

18

disposing of goods illegally imported, in violation of

19

Customs Act, Section 155.

It charges unlawful

So Canada has its own process.

20

There has -- there has not been, to my

21

knowledge, any request by Canada for extradition, but the

22

treaty between the United States and Canada does include

23

revenue violations, and -

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

Presumably, if we punish this

person this way, Canada wouldn't -- there's no double

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

jeopardy, right?

2

MS. BRILL:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.
So we'd be punishing this

4

person for violating Canadian law, and then Canada would

5

punish this person for violating Canadian law.

6

MS. BRILL:

Yes, I haven't looked in detail at

7

the statute of limitations provisions, but that could be

8

the effect.

9

severely than Canada would be.

And we could be punishing them much more
They have their own means

10

of balancing what they think the appropriate balance is

11

for these things, and certainly the wire fraud statute, 57

12

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I think the Government

14

has an interest in saying, "Look, if you're going to

15

smuggle, have your scheme up there in Canada; don't use

16

our wire systems for fraudulent purposes.

17

that here."

We don't like

say that this covers it, and it seems to me that really

2

the Canadian revenue agent got inside of New York and one

3

of your clients beat him up, would we have -- solely

4

because he was mad at him for trying to interfere with his

5

attempt to smuggle into Canada -- would we have to say

6

that you can't do that, we have no jurisdiction over the

7

assault and battery?

8

MS. BRILL:

No, Justice Stevens.

Supposing

question is whether you're JUSTICE STEVENS:

The only purpose would be just

what the purpose is here, they're trying to facilitate the

MS. BRILL:

Well, the assault and battery -

14

whatever the assault and battery provisions are, you would

be bringing the prosecution solely for that purpose; it

does not have any -- the effect of applying the assault

conclusion.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, but it used broad

19

language, "Any scheme to defraud by means of wire

communications in interstate or foreign commerce."

21

MS. BRILL:

The wire -- it is -- the wire

communications may be an interstate or foreign commerce,

2

people who defraud the United States Government in taxes?
MS. BRILL:

Your Honor, the government's

3

position on that, I believe, is somewhat inconsistent.

4

The tax -- the tax division and the Department of Justice

5

U.S. Attorneys manual specifies that it is -- they believe

6

it is the intent of Congress that tax matters will be

7

dealt with through the internal revenue code, not through

8

other means.

9

There are -- there have been some prosecutions

10

brought in the case of an illegal -- an illegal tax

11

shelter, where there is truly an -- a private party who is

12

defrauded into giving up money in connection with -

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you don't -- you don't know

14

of any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving

15

the Federal Government of property.

16

MS. BRILL:

Well, the Henderson case, which we

17

have cited in our reply brief, is one from the Southern

18

District of New York, where Judge Weinfeld said, when

19

faced with a mail fraud prosecution of that type, this is

20

outside the scope of anything that Congress intended.

21

The -- I would like to get back to the issue of

22

money or property so that it -- to have it conceptually

23

why an unassessed tax claim is not money or property.

24

There is no allegation that -- in the indictment or

think the statute would clearly apply.

MR. DREEBEN:
the Court:

10

Justice Stevens, and may it please

A prosecution for wire fraud based on defrauding
a foreign government of taxes serves at least four
distinct United States prosecutorial interests.

11

The first is that the creation of schemes to

12

defraud frequently spawns collateral criminal conduct in

13

the United States above and beyond the fraudulent scheme

itself.

anything as to whether there ought to be a wire fraud

I mean, if the United States says, "We

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, what it tells you, Justice

Souter, is why the United States has an interest in

enforcing a law that facially is written to cover schemes

wires.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that's -- but that's a

reason for extending the statute to everything, to

anything at all.

20

catch.

21

I mean, what you're saying is, the broader

I'll stipulate that.
MR. DREEBEN:

Of course it's true.

Well, Justice Scalia, I'm starting

22

from the proposition that the language of the wire fraud

23

statute textually applies to this scheme, and Petitioner's

24

argument is that, because of the common law revenue rule,

25

the statute should be read to exclude schemes to defraud a

2

3

mean that the United States does not have an independent

4

interest in rooting out that scheme and prosecuting it.

5

And the fact that a

In addition to the collateral criminal conduct

6

that such schemes can spawn, the creation of such schemes

7

indicates a criminal mind and a criminal group that can

8

turn its techniques for used -- using to smuggle into

9

Canada, also to smuggle back into the United States or to

10

victimize other victims in the United States.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about evading a Cuban tax

law that we think -- that many people would think is an

13

unjust tax law?

14

about is that this gets us into foreign policy.

15

sure that we always want to enforce the tax laws of

16

foreign countries through this fraud statute, no matter

17

what those tax laws happen to be?

MR. DREEBEN:

I mean, one of the things I'm worried
Are you

The United States has

19

prosecutorial discretion to determine when to invoke the

20

statute and in what interests it should be served.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It may well, but when it comes

22

here, this Court is going to have to decide -- we'll just

23

approve whatever you want to prosecute and let you not

24

prosecute whatever you want?

because international criminal organizations are

3

particularly difficult for the United States to deal with.

4

And the fourth reason is that it is an offense to a

conclude, to allow our soil and our wires to be used to

perpetrate a smuggling scheme against a foreign government

8

with the United States doing nothing about it.

So never mind the revenue rule, isn't it

MR. DREEBEN:

No, of course there were smugglers

3

the only justification -- the only two justifications for

seeking to read it narrowly are, first, that there's a

common law revenue rule that forms a backdrop for the

construction of the statute.

rule that has ever been articulated that says one country

that to deprive a foreign government of money by not

paying tax revenues is not common law fraud.

arguments against both of those two.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Breyer, first of

all, the complexity of foreign tax law is something that

17

would defeat a federal prosecution in which we need to

18

show specific intent to defraud if the law were not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

To go to one more aspect of

13

the statute which I don't think you've addressed, Congress

14

said that -- with respect to the wire fraud and mail fraud

15

and, I think, other things -- that restitution to the

16

victim is mandatory, that it's not left up to the

17

government to decide restitution or not.

18

restitution sounds very much like enforcing Canada's

19

taxes, so you have conceded no restitution.

20

to me that Congress thought of the wire/mail fraud

21

statutes as cases in which there would be restitution, and

22

that suggests that they didn't envision foreign taxes to

23

be the object of the scheme to defraud.

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

Except here

But it seems

Justice Ginsburg, the syllogism

doesn't track, because the entire scope of the revenue

pointed to as the background principle, has to do with a

foreign government, or someone acting on its behalf,

rules.

determining that it is in the interest of the United

States to bring a criminal prosecution.

Now, in this case, the prosecutor did concede

10

That's not the position of the United States.

infringe the revenue rule.

MR. DREEBEN:

No, there isn't, Justice Ginsburg,

20

but the revenue rule isn't of such a broad scope that it

21

applies to efforts by the United States Government to

22

secure punishment by -- for a criminal conviction.

23

But, Justice Ginsburg, if the Court were to

24

disagree with that and were to believe that restitution,

25

even when it's been sought by the United States -- not by

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a foreign government, in its own right, with the power to

2

instigate a lawsuit -- but that even when the United

3

States does it, that somehow falls within the parameters

4

of the common law revenue rule, then the answer to that

5

problem would be to interpret the restitution statute

6

against the background of the revenue rule, not to

7

interpret the wire fraud statute against the background of

8

the revenue rule and hold that a prosecution by the United

9

States is wholly barred.

10
11

The Petitioner's submission here is really
rather extraordinary -

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The restitution statute is not

13

ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of

14

ambiguities in it.

15

restitution problem, I would pick the ambiguous statute to

16

get out, rather than simply saying, "Well, though this

17

restitution statute says this categorically, we will

18

ignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be

19

enforcing the revenue laws of another country."

20

nothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another

21

country, if we want to; this is just a question of

22

statutory interpretation.

Should this ambiguous statute

23

be interpreted that way?

If Congress said, "We're going

24

to enforce Canada's tax laws," there's nothing wrong with

25

that.

The wire fraud statute is unequivocally broad, and it has

been so interpreted.

of whether it applies to schemes to defraud that may

involve foreign victims; it says "any scheme to defraud."

And I think, as Justice Kennedy's questions pointed out

against that background, and unless it makes its intent

17

somewhat in tension with your view that the common law

If you have to interpret the statute in light of the

20

general rule that one country doesn't mess with another

21

country's taxes, absent a treaty.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, there is

23

no common law rule that one country doesn't mess with

24

another country's taxes.

versions of this problem, what you had is a foreign

3

government or an entity, acting at the behest of a foreign

4

government, coming into another country seeking to use

5

that country's courts to enforce its own tax rules.

6

in that context, the justifications for saying that one

7

country will not enforce another country's revenue laws

8

have to do with the sovereignty interests of the host

9

country.

10

And in all of the 20th century

And

One country, when it seeks to obtain revenue to

11

carry out its own governmental policies, is doing

12

something fundamental to its sovereign existence, and

13

there's no obligation of the United States to assist the

14

foreign government in using its court system to achieve

15

those independent sovereign aims, no prohibition on it,

16

either.

viewed as contrary to an abrogation of -- or a -- you

they have said, "It has nothing to do with it"?

careful in defining what the parameters of the common law

treat it as some dynamic entity that has capability of

MR. DREEBEN:

It would probably be in derogation

of a more -

MR. DREEBEN:

Not the revenue rule -

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. DREEBEN:

That's what -

Not the -

10

principle that one country usually does not legislate with

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. DREEBEN:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15
16

That would be another one, too.

But if you Suppose they -- I -- that's why

I want to know MR. DREEBEN:

But that's not applicable here,

17

either, Justice Breyer, because the crime involves wire

fraud in the United States.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Yeah, but why isn't it applicable

20

to the extent that there seems to be a mandatory obligation

21

to order restitution?

22

restitution that would be ordered would be just as much in

derogation of the common law principle as the out-and-out

you said, "Okay, we'll assume that there would be some

derogation," in Justice Breyer's example.

you don't come to the same conclusion with respect to the

8

restitution aspect here.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't see why

Because the derogation that I was

talking about with respect to Justice Breyer is punishing

11

conduct that occurs entirely extraterritorially.

12

not conduct that occurs entirely -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

This is

Yeah, but the revenue -- the

14

revenue rule does not rest simply on the rationale of non-

extraterritorial enforcement.

rationales: difficulty of understanding what the revenue

rule is; the -- you know, the problems of policy; there

18

are lots of revenue rules in foreign countries that we

that allowed countries to avoid invalidating contracts

saying it is criminal in England to break the laws of

9

France.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

See, he's saying it isn't, for

11

the reason that, he says, that if England did it for

12

independent reasons, it wasn't doing it because it wanted

13

to help France get it's money, that then it wouldn't have

14

been in derogation.

15

either way, but he says it wouldn't have been in

16

derogation, for that reason.

17

Of course, it would have been legal,

MS. BRILL:

Right.

Well, it clearly would have.

18

There was no common law practice -- we have -- we have not

19

found, in all the research -- and the Government has not

20

found -- any example of a criminal prosecution -- not just

21

in this country; anywhere in the world -- to -- deriving

22

from the violation of a foreign government's tax.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And so

You're saying, in effect, that

derogation is an effects test, not an intent test.

MS. BRILL:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Justice

Souter.

3

And the -- in terms of what the government's

4

interests are, there were no deceptive acts in this

5

country.

6

misstatement is by a failure to disclose at the Canadian

7

border, which only -- even though they did not put in

8

evidence of what the -- that Canada even had a law

9

requiring disclosure, the only way there could have been

The way the Government gets a material

10

any kind of material misstatement would be if Canadian law

11

required it, not if -- not anything that happened in the

12

United States.

13

In Cleveland, the Court was very clear to point

14

out -- one of the reasons to adopt a rule of lenity in

15

interpreting the mail fraud statute and the wire fraud

16

statute is because violations serve as a predicate for

17

RICO actions and for money-laundering violations.

18

what the government's position is, is that we should carve

19

out this ad-hoc exception and allow wire fraud

20

prosecution, even though we would not allow any kind of a

21

civil RICO action and even though we're going to have an

22

ad-hoc exception for the Mandatory Victims Restitution

23

Act.

24

should do this is by adopting a proper interpretation in

25

the first place, not by -- of the wire fraud statute -

And so

But what the Court said in Cleveland is, the way we

not by having ad-hoc exceptions.
And the reference to prosecutorial discretion

3

that there should be faith that the Government will only

4

prosecute, I guess, what the Government regards as

5

exceptional cases is not something that can provide any

6

business involved in an international transaction with any

7

-- with any comfort.

And thank you very much.
