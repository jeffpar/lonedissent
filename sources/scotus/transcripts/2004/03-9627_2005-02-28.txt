ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID WYCOFF

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WYCOFF:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Pace, at age 17, was sentenced to life

11

without possibility of parole after being misled by his

12

lawyer and the court.

13

His right to Federal habeas review depends

14

entirely upon whether his State post-conviction

15

proceedings tolled the AEDPA statute of limitations.

16

Court should -

17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

This

Well, he -- he had a prior

18

round of hearings at the State level on these same claims,

19

did he not?

20

MR. WYCOFF:

On different claims, Your Honor.

21

He had a first, a -- under what was called the PCHA in

22

Pennsylvania.

23

PCRA petition -

24
25

The tolling question here is whether the

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I know, but the substance of

it, saying it isn't fair to give me life without parole

1

because of what happened, I didn't understand the plea -

2

he raised that in State court before.

3

MR. WYCOFF:

He raised it in the first

4

proceeding an ineffective -

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

6

MR. WYCOFF:

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

8

MR. WYCOFF:

9

Yes.

-- assistance of counsel claim Yes.

-- related to that and some other

claims related to that -

10

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

11

MR. WYCOFF:

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Right.

-- in the second proceeding.
And he -- he essentially

13

wants to relitigate the substance of those previous

14

claims.

15

MR. WYCOFF:

No, Your Honor.

He actually -- the

16

first petition raised only an ineffectiveness claim.

17

second petition raised a due process challenge to the

18

colloquy, which was not exhausted in the first, raised new

19

evidence to support the claim which Pennsylvania law

20

allowed him to do, and raised a constitutional and State

21

law challenge to the legality of his sentence.

22

new claims in the second proceeding.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

There were

-- of both claims was,

24

however he dressed it up in -- in due process, that I

25

wasn't told at the time of my sentencing that life meant

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

life without parole.

2

his complaint the first time around, wasn't it?

3

MR. WYCOFF:

That was the essence, the core of

Yes, that his lawyer misled him was

4

the first claim, that by telling him he'd be out in 10 to

5

15 years.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- but the essence of

7

it was I wasn't told that life meant I would never get out

8

of prison.

9

MR. WYCOFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MR. WYCOFF:

Both times.

In -- in the second he raised that

12

plus that the colloquy itself was defective and that the

13

sentence, the life without parole sentence, was illegal

14

and unconstitutional, apart from the misinformation

15

aspect.

16

So they were different claims.
Let me start with statutory tolling.

Section

17

2244(d)(2) of AEDPA provides tolling during properly filed

18

applications for State post-conviction review.

19

Court's unanimous decision in Artuz, Mr. Pace's PCRA

20

petition was properly filed.

21

functions in all material ways like the New York State

22

procedural bar rules at issue in Artuz.

23

Under this

In fact, the PCRA time bar

Now, Artuz also identified some types of rules

24

that would prevent an application from being properly

25

filed, for example, the AEDPA successive bar which makes

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you go to the court of appeals first and get permission

2

before you can actually file in the district court, and it

3

has a screening mechanism to make sure that only petitions

4

with a prima facie chance get filed.

5

The PCRA time bar is nothing like that at all.

6

It's like the State court procedural bar rules in Artuz.

7

There's no condition to filing.

8

any time.

9

petition, has to give it judicial review -- yes, Your

10
11

You can go and file at

The court, as a matter of law, has to take your

Honor.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Wycoff, are you taking

12

the position that this -- that Artuz -- I thought,

13

frankly, that Artuz had classified within properly filed

14

timely filed and then had a footnote, and it says that

15

there might be some exceptions to a timely filing rule -

16

MR. WYCOFF:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- rule.

And they're not

18

taking a position about that.

19

time limitation falls under the procedural bar label.

20

MR. WYCOFF:

But you quickly said this

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Yes.

This

21

-- Artuz said that a time limit without exception, say, in

22

30 days you must file in 30 days, no exception, or in 1

23

year, no exceptions -- that's what Artuz called a

24

condition to filing and that you're either in or you're

25

out in that rule.

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And Artuz, though, reserved the question

2

presented here of whether a time bar with exceptions, like

3

the PCRA time bar -- whether that could be properly filed.

4

And so obviously, Artuz reserved the exact question here.

5

But what -- the analysis of Artuz controls here and shows

6

that this petition was properly filed.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

exceptions are.

9

are three exceptions.

10

MR. WYCOFF:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

If -- if -- as -- here I understand there

Yes, Your Honor.
And they're all spelled out in

the statute.

13
14

Well, it depends on what the

MR. WYCOFF:

They're similar to the AEDPA

exceptions.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

And -- and if you do not

16

plead any of those exceptions when you -- when you file,

17

it seems to me it's not properly filed.

18

MR. WYCOFF:

19

responses to that, Your Honor.

20

terms of Mr. Pace, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has said

21

it wasn't at all clear before, roughly, December of 1999

22

that you actually need to plead those exceptions in your

23

petition.

24

petition, but at the time it wasn't clear.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't care what the

2

Pennsylvania law is.

3

have a statute that says it's untimely unless one of these

4

three exceptions apply, and -- and you -- you simply file

5

and you don't say -- and it's clearly out of time without

6

one of the exceptions, and you simply file and don't say

7

but this exception applies, it seems to me that's not

8

properly filed, whatever the rule in -- in Pennsylvania

9

was.

10

MR. WYCOFF:

I mean, it -- it seems to me if you

If -- in terms of -- to go to

11

Artuz' analysis, you would have to look at each -- the

12

exceptions are -- go claim by claim.

13

look at each claim and see did you plead the exception for

14

this claim, yes or no; this claim, yes or no.

15
16

JUSTICE SCALIA:
them, none at all.

You would have to

So again -

But you haven't pleaded any of

You just file it -

17

MR. WYCOFF:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In that case --- several years out of time.

19

You -- you make no assertion that any one of the -- of the

20

three specific exceptions applies.

21

could possibly be considered properly filed.

22
23
24
25

MR. WYCOFF:

I don't see how that

Because the court still accepts it,

reviews it to see if any of the exceptions apply.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ah, that -- that's your theory

It's not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. WYCOFF:

In -- in Pennsylvania, the

But you haven't made the claim.

Well, that's what the court would

10

determine.

11

would be able to dispose of it quickly and -

12

And presumably in a case like that, the court

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what does the

13

Pennsylvania court -- law now say with respect to claim-

14

by-claim pleading of the exceptions?

15

MR. WYCOFF:

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court now

16

has said you should plead in the PCRA petition the

17

exceptions.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

raising, yes.

Claim by claim?

For each -- any claim that you're

JUSTICE BREYER:

This problem couldn't arise

22

again in Pennsylvania, couldn't it, because they have a 1

23

year statute of limitations?

24

that you could be untimely filing within the 1 year that

25

you have to go to Federal court.

So there would be no way

MR. WYCOFF:

It -- it can arise again, Your

Honor, and that -

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. WYCOFF:

It can?

How could it -

Yes, it can arise again and -- and

5

will many times arise again because consider someone who's

6

already had his or her AEDPA year pass and then discovers,

7

say, a Brady claim and wants to go back and litigate that.

8

Under AEDPA, you would have a year to get back into court

9

with that.

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. WYCOFF:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

I thought AEDPA you

had to file within a year.

12

14

You do.

you're out of luck.

Yes.
And then if you miss the year,

Period.

MR. WYCOFF:

That's -- yes, but under State law,

16

you only have 60 days to get that.

17

Pennsylvania who finds a Brady claim, say, has to get back

18

into State court within 60 days of discovering that.

19

his -- he -- he could go into State court -

20
21

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see.

So someone in

So

So in other words, he

-- his conviction is final.

22

MR. WYCOFF:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
60 days runs after his final

24

conviction and then between the 60th day and the 365th

25

day, he has discovered his Brady claim and has not got

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

into court within 60 days.
MR. WYCOFF:

Or he finds it in what he thinks is

3

within 60 days of when he should have found it.

4

his State post-conviction application.

5

litigation, the court says, you know, you really should

6

have found it 59 days ago, not 60.

JUSTICE BREYER:

He files

It couldn't arise.

That is, a

10

365 days after the finality of the State court direct

11

review, that person is out of luck under anybody's

12

interpretation because more than a year has passed since

13

it became final, i.e., the State direct review.

14

right or wrong about that?

15

MR. WYCOFF:

Am I

That's what's puzzling me.

It -- it depends on if there's a

16

new -- if -- if there has not been a new triggering date,

17

other than the finality for the AEDPA date, then you will

18

be out of time for AEDPA.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
year and that's it.

AEDPA has exceptions.

21

MR. WYCOFF:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

But AEDPA -- it doesn't say 1

Yes, it does, Your Honor.
The exemptions still could be

the problem.
MR. WYCOFF:

Yes.

And in fact, everyone now who

has, say, a Brady claim is going to have -- under Third

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Circuit law as it is now, is going to have to come into

2

Federal court and file a protective habeas petition

3

because the odds are very likely that more than a -- the

4

AEDPA year is going to run while they litigate this.

5
6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. WYCOFF:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

We would have to breathe

life back into the stay and abey -

7

9

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.
But let me ask you this.

Returning to our earlier discussion about pleading a
specific exemption -

11

MR. WYCOFF:

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
-- are there States, do you

13

know, where that is not required and the State court will

14

go through the exceptions even if you haven't pled them?

15

MR. WYCOFF:

Well, Pennsylvania actually does

16

that and certainly did it at the time Mr. Pace was

17

litigating.

18
19
20
21
22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but I thought you said

Pennsylvania law had changed now.
MR. WYCOFF:

They have said now you should plead

them at the petition -- in the petition.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But my -- my question is do

23

you know if there are other States where they say, we

24

don't care if you plead these -

25

MR. WYCOFF:

I -

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

2

not?

3

ourselves.

4

-- exemptions specifically or

We're going to look through it and find it for

MR. WYCOFF:

I -- I don't know the answer to

5

that.

6

Pennsylvania courts still do that.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I know that was the practice.

In -- in fact,

And you say that if that's the

8

case, you can file a -- a State -- a State claim that is

9

plainly no good and until the State court finally gets

10

around to -- to telling you that it's no good, your -

11

your AEDPA claim is tolled.

12

MR. WYCOFF:

Yes, while you're -- and the State

13

could easily prevent that by setting up some kind of

14

prefiling requirement for -

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that's, in -- in effect,

16

saying that there is no -- that the properly filed, given

17

the Pennsylvania procedure, does not include timely filed.

18

MR. WYCOFF:

The -- the question of whether it

19

was timely or not is not actually determined until the end

20

of the litigation.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But -- but you have just said

22

that the -- the court will look on its own to see if there

23

are these exceptions.

24

MR. WYCOFF:

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
So that there would be no

13
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

case of an untimely filing in this period when the court

2

was -- even if you raised no exception, was going through

3

them.

4

MR. WYCOFF:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
There would be no case in

6

which an untimely filing would be included in properly

7

filed because the very fact that the court itself would go

8

through the petition to look for exceptions would take it

9

out of the category.

10

MR. WYCOFF:

Yes, Your Honor, and exactly the

11

same could be said about Artuz, the procedural bar rules

12

in Artuz, whether someone pled -

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the -- the difference was

14

that Artuz ranked timely filing as an ingredient of

15

properly filed, and you say but not in Pennsylvania the

16

way it's set up.

17

properly filed.

18

Timely filing is not an ingredient of

MR. WYCOFF:

Because the State court lets you

19

file it and gives it judicial review and applies it claim

20

by claim.

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But don't -- don't you have a

22

-- a -- sort of a second prong to -- to your response?

23

And I -- I wanted to get into this.

24

Pennsylvania will let you file even though ultimately it,

25

you know, may well determine that you -- you were out of

You -- you have said

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

time and you don't fall within any of the exceptions.

2

Well, that's -- that's an answer.

3

strong enough answer to respond to Artuz.

4

I'm not sure it's a

But I thought you had a second part to the

5

answer, and I thought your second part to the answer was

6

in that kind of situation, the Third Circuit practice, the

7

Third Circuit rule is that unless we go through the

8

Pennsylvania process, even if we know from day one that

9

we're out of time, we think we have a -- an excuse, but

10

even though we -- we think from day one we're out of time,

11

unless we exhaust the Pennsylvania process, they will

12

throw us out for nonexhaustion.

13

throw us out from nonexhaustion, as opposed to going

14

directly to the question whether there is an excuse for

15

nonexhaustion, is because Pennsylvania will actually let

16

us litigate this -

17

MR. WYCOFF:

18

JUSTICE SOUTER:

19
20

And the reason they will

Yes.
-- and not determine it as a

threshold matter.
So -- so your answer, as I understand it, is

21

Pennsylvania let's you litigate it, and the Third Circuit

22

requires you to litigate it so that the only reasonable

23

thing for us to do is to litigate it even if you may say

24

in the abstract it's a purely threshold time question.

25

And for that reason, there should be tolling.

Isn't that

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

your argument?
MR. WYCOFF:

Yes, Your Honor.

And it's -- it's

3

connected to the statutory language.

4

toll for properly filed applications.

5

keyed to how much process the State post-conviction courts

6

will give you.

7

who comes after a year, we won't give you any review and

8

you're just out of court, AEDPA says when -- that's not -

9

we're not going to consider that properly filed.

10
11

AEDPA says we'll
That -- AEDPA is

We won't

toll, but JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is putting such a -- I

12

mean, the system is not going to work.

13

State system that has an absolute statute of limitation

14

with no exceptions.

15

inquire into exceptions.

16

to avoid -- avoid AEDPA endlessly, just keep filing claims

17

that are out of time, and until the court finally gets

18

around to saying it's out of time, your -- your AEDPA time

19

is tolled -

It -- it's a rare

You're almost going to have to

20

MR. WYCOFF:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you're saying this is a way

Well -- by which time you file

22

another one that's clearly out of time.

23

one is resolved -- I -- this couldn't be what AEDPA was -

24

was meant to establish.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And until that

And -- and if you're tempted

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to answer, well, people want to get out so they're not

2

going to sit around forever, then we'd ask you what about

3

the death cases.

4

MR. WYCOFF:

Okay, and that was what I was

5

tempted to answer, and since you said it, I'll go straight

6

to the death cases.

7

In Pennsylvania, certainly there's no -- a

8

death-sentence prisoner can get nowhere by filing what he

9

knows to be an untimely PCRA petition because Pennsylvania

10

law requires the Governor to sign warrants when the

11

conviction is final and then at every break in the

12

litigation basically after that.

13

cannot grant a stay of execution until after they find

14

that the petition is both timely and meritorious.

15

not -

16
17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not sure that would apply

MR. WYCOFF:

That's true.

And I mean, each

19

State can set up a system to -- to satisfy its needs.

20

Pennsylvania could set up a system like the AEDPA

21

successor bar to say you're not going to be filed at all

22

until we give you permission.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. WYCOFF:

You just keep filing and

Presumably you could and if there's

someone who wants to do that, which is going to be a
rare JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you lost on that one.

12

Suppose that you wanted some kind of a -- suppose that the

13

majority wanted a standard that would prevent absolutely

14

frivolous filings on the basis of -- of statute of

15

limitations.

16

what's our choice of standards there?

17

obviously, that the prisoner has to be in good faith.

18

Another could be he has to be in good faith and there has

19

to be a reasonable argument that it hasn't run.

20

there are others that you've thought of.

21

Would you -- what standard would -- what -

MR. WYCOFF:

Could we -- one,

Maybe

I think that going down that path

22

is going to open up just a nightmare of -- of litigation

23

in Federal court about -- if you start talking about good

24

faith and are you -- if the State courts deny it, can you

25

still say it was nonfrivolous?

I think all the courts

just across the board have tried to avoid that type of

2

thing.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Try -- try this simple rule.

4

Where you're dealing with a statute of limitations that

5

has exceptions, it's not properly filed if you do not

6

assert the existence of one of those exceptions.

7

MR. WYCOFF:

Two -- I have two things to say

8

about that.

9

because that type of rule -- assuming the exceptions are

One is it creates a problem with Artuz

10

like the PCRA exceptions which go claim by claim, that's a

11

claim-by-claim rule which would then create the anomaly

12

that Artuz shied away from, that you look to whether it

13

was a properly filed application, not to whether it was an

14

application with properly filed claims.

15

The second point is that -- is that for Mr.

16

Pace, whatever the merits of that rule may be going

17

forward, it -- it can't be used against Mr. Pace because

18

there was no such requirement in Pennsylvania.

19

presumably the -- I assume the Federal courts are not

20

going to make up this rule, that it's going to be up to

21

the State courts to say what their filing -

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why not?

I mean,

We make up a

lot of stuff.

2

3

meaning, but you presumably look to the State filing

4

requirements, as you did in Artuz, to determine what that

5

means.

6

This is a

Now, all of these concerns about delay and so on

are the exact same concerns, where there in Artuz someone

could file successive petition after successive petition

in New York if they want to delay.

It's just not -- it's

10

not a -- it's certainly not a problem for noncapital

11

cases.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

AEDPA was -- was to prevent delay.

the court doesn't want lots of people filing prematurely.

If I could, I'd like to turn to equitable
tolling.

6

As Chief District Judge Giles found, that it

7

would be an extraordinary deprivation of rights and

8

patently unfair to deny tolling in Federal review here, he

9

found -- Judge Giles found that if Mr. Pace had filed a

10

Federal habeas petition instead of his PCRA petition,

11

Judge Giles would have dismissed it and required him to do

12

exactly what he did, which is to seek State remedies under

13

the PCRA.

14

and appropriately under the circumstances.

15
16
17

As Judge Giles found, Mr. Pace acted diligently

It seems this is a clear case for equitable
tolling.

This is a case where JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. WYCOFF:

I have, I think, four responses to

that.

4

First, Mr. Pace was not sitting on his hands for

5

these 4 years.

6

17, barely educated, barely literate, drug-addled.

7

is not someone who was prepared to litigate on his own

8

when he came into prison.

9

legal papers were destroyed by the prison.

This is a man who entered prison at age
This

This is someone who -- whose
This is

10

someone who was without counsel for that entire time that

11

you're talking about.

12

limited access to a law library throughout that time.

13

Pace spent those years teaching himself how to do law

14

which he -

15

This is someone who had very

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr.

-- take a whole lot to figure

16

out that you have a claim where your lawyer told you -

17

you weren't going up for life and it turned out you were

18

sent up for life.

19

MR. WYCOFF:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In fact I mean, what does it take if -

21

can a 17-year-old figure that something has gone wrong

22

here?

23

MR. WYCOFF:

Well, in fact, that -- that claim

24

was litigated -- litigated in the first petition, and in

25

fact, he didn't think of that.

If you look at his pro se

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

PCHA petition, he didn't know that was a claim.

2

it's a form that he filled out and handed in and appointed

3

counsel came up with that claim in the first post-

4

conviction proceeding.

5

This is much more complex than that.

It's a -

If you

6

look at his briefs, which are in the joint appendix,

7

Pennsylvania had a very complex system of law here where

8

they had statutory bar rules but they had judicial

9

exceptions to those rules.

10
11

And it's not an easy matter

for someone to figure that out.
Mr. Pace educated himself.

Just compare the pro

12

se pleading filed in 1992 to what he filed in 1996, and

13

you can see what he did during these 4 years.

14

The other -- the other -- just -- my light is

15

on, but just the other things I'd like to mention about

16

that are that keep in mind, during this time there were no

17

time limits on filing in either State or Federal court.

18

The commonwealth has never alleged any prejudice from this

19

time, and there's never been any allegation that Mr. Pace

20

acted in bad faith and with any -- any intent to delay.

21

In fact, this is someone who wanted to get his claims

22

heard, wanted to figure out how to do it right, and did

23

figure out how to do it right in the end.

24

I would like to reserve the rest of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD EISENBERG

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5

MR. EISENBERG:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to address the structure of the

8

Pennsylvania filing deadlines for post-conviction review

9

because I think they shed some light and need some

10
11

discussion here.
What Pennsylvania did was to establish a 1

12

year, flat time limit that applies to everybody.

13

from conviction.

14

15

16

17

petition within 1 year of finality.

18

It's automatic.

1 year

It doesn't matter what

It doesn't matter when you

In order to comply with that time

The rest of the statute is essentially a

19

separate set of filing deadlines for petitioners, for

20

successive petitioners, for people who either have already

21

had one round of post-conviction review or who haven't

22

bothered to pursue it.

23

legislature, are only going to be entitled to further

24

post-conviction review, to additional rounds of post-

25

conviction review if they fall into a particular class of

Those people, said the

27
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

claim that couldn't have been raised earlier.

2

the legislature identified three classes that mirror the

3

three provisions in the Federal statute of limitations.

4

And if the petitioner falls within any of those classes,

5

he then has 60 days from the time that that claim arose in

6

order to come into court.

And -- and

7

Now, if a petitioner files a post-conviction

petition and he's within a year of finality, those so-

9

called exceptions don't come into play.

10

He doesn't need to meet them.

11

petitioner.

12

They don't apply.

Those are for the second

So what Pennsylvania really has is a two-level

13

system of statutes of -- of filing limitations.

14

course, in order for the court to determine whether the

15

petitioner has met the filing deadline, he has to look at

16

these three classes for someone who has passed 1 year from

17

finality.

18

the petitioner and some of the lower courts have used the

19

term at all.

20

22

is available and to see whether the petitioner has sought

23

review within the proper time.

24
25

And of

That's not an exception in the way I think that

These are simply different kinds of filing

And of course, the court has to look at the

Nothing about that system makes those so-called
exceptions not time limits.

They're still time limits,

28
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

and if you don't file in time and come within one of those

2

classes, then the second petition, successive petition

3

time limits don't apply to you and you're out of time.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but if we accept your

5

position, it seems to me that State prisoners are going

6

to have to go but once to Federal court and then they're

7

-- they're going to run into an exhaustion requirement.

8
9

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, they're not going to run

into an exhaustion requirement, Your Honor, because if

10

they've already been through one round of State post-

11

conviction review, then they are unlikely to be able to

12

exhaust more claims because there's a -- there's a -

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

MR. EISENBERG:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

16
17

Well, we're --- 1-year time limit.
-- we're assuming a late-

discovered claim that's within AEDPA.
MR. EISENBERG:

That's right.

And so the

18

question is whether -- and what petitioner is really

19

saying is that the AEDPA 1-year time limit should be

20

suspended essentially indefinitely as long as the

21

petitioner wants to argue that he may have some late-

22

discovered claim in State court.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It -- it's my -- I still have a

24

feeling that this is a limited universe.

25

for thinking that is that the Federal statute says you

7

And the middle two are special new cases, unusual
The first one and the fourth one are the
The first one is final in the State

Now, my guess is most States also allow you for

8

collateral -- to file collateral relief in those two

9

circumstances.

And in most States probably you get nearly

10

a year from the same kind of event.

11

the year, you're out of luck in Federal court.

12

within the year, you're probably okay for the State.

13

there are a few States that have -- maybe Pennsylvania -

14

just 60 days from one of the events, newly discovered

15

evidence, but a year for the Federal.

16

about people who file between 2 and 12 months.

17

that must be a pretty limited class.

satisfied with the round of direct appeal and a round of

2

3

the question is whether the Federal statute should be

4

interpreted in a way that essentially writes off the

5

State's time requirements for the successive petitioner so

6

that we can make sure that the successive petitioner can

exhaust whatever new claims he wants to come up with in

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, let's What do I do it in a State

where there is a plausible close question of whether or

14

along the same line.

15

MR. EISENBERG:

The -- the general rule -- and

16

this is implicit I think in the fact that Congress passed

a statute of limitations.

18

petitioner is entitled to whatever he automatically gets

19

in State court in order to exhaust a universe of claims,

20

not all possible claims, but whatever claims can be

21

exhausted within those guaranteed rounds of review.

22

that point, he should go to Federal court.

23

The general rule is that the

As to equitable tolling, however, the factual

premise is wrong.

forces the defendant to go back to State court no matter

but at a limited point in time, and the whole question for

2

equitable tolling purposes was at what point in time.

3

Nobody argues that the Third Circuit still is making

4

everybody go back and do it no matter what.

5

What the petitioner argued was that the Third

6

Circuit case law, as of 1997 when he was first starting

7

his second round of post-conviction review in State court,

8

as of that time, he says, the Third Circuit case law said

9

you have to go back no matter what even though

10

Pennsylvania has a -- this new statute of limitations.

11

That's not what the Third Circuit says, though.

12

And all the cases that the petitioner relies on primarily

13

-- he cites a -- a case called Doctor, a case called

14

Banks, a case called Lambert.

15

decided before the Pennsylvania courts began applying the

16

new jurisdictional time bar in State court.

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All of those cases were

If that means the petitioner

18

was wrong, doesn't it also mean that Judge Giles is wrong,

19

and if Judge Giles can't figure it out, isn't there a

20

pretty good argument that the petitioner ought to get

21

equitable tolling?

22

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, there are a number of

23

problems with the equitable tolling, Your Honor.

24

taking that main one, that the petitioner made a mistake

25

of law, that he didn't figure out correctly whether he was

2

Your Honor, that's not grounds for equitable tolling.

3

take a risk when you make a legal argument that it will

4

fail.

5

State law, and what the Third Circuit, as opposed to Judge

6

Giles who was reversed by the Third Circuit said, is that

7

you have to look back to State law.

concerned, yes.

24

tolling when the petitioner gets it wrong?

25

And -- and so if Judge Giles got it

MR. EISENBERG:

What there is is an argument

that he had an argument to make in Federal court that he

2

was not -- that he was still going to have the opportunity

3

to go back to State court.

But the problem is that Federal courts can't

decide for the States how their time bars are going to be

applied.

And if instead they said JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. EISENBERG:

It's not true that nobody could

13

figure it out, Your Honor.

14

the petitioner cites in his brief from Federal district

15

court judges who were sending defendants back to State

16

court during this period because they said, well, maybe

17

you'll get exhaustion anyway, maybe you'll be able to

18

exhaust claims, of those cases that are cited in the

19

brief, most of them are from the same one judge who kept

20

saying the same thing over and over.

21

cases didn't even talk about the State time bar, and at

22

that same period of time, there were other district judges

23

who weren't sending defendants back, who were saying

24

there's a new State time bar, you're barred in State

MR. EISENBERG:

No.

That's what Judge Giles

said many years after the fact.

13

Judge Giles would have ruled at the time?

there are other judges, Federal judges, who were ruling

otherwise at the time, and the Third Circuit -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

not to?

20

MR. EISENBERG:

The point is, Your Honor, that

that's not the test for equitable tolling.

there's no problem.

Now, am I supposed to say in Oklahoma which has

a petition in State court, let's say, on the 180th day,

and he thinks an exception applies, is he supposed to also

run to Federal court and file a protective petition which

could well have been dismissed on exhaustion grounds?

What's he supposed to do and how is he supposed to know

what to do?

And one system that might work is Justice
Scalia's idea.

MR. EISENBERG:

Well, it's -Another that might work is -

is requiring in death cases that it be a -- a plausible

It certainly shouldn't be a

And it certainly would work if we adopted, as I

think Congress did, a system like the one that Justice

Scalia spelled out because then the defendant knows.

And I'd like to get back, as I was discussing

Your Honor, the -- the Congress

that passed this statute of limitations is the same

12

Congress that made the decision about whether habeas

13

petitioners would be appointed counsel or not.

14

that we can't really apply the statute of limitations

15

because it would be unfair as to those petitioners who are

unrepresented would be essentially to undercut the statute

of limitations --

JUSTICE BREYER:

So to say

I'm trying to get from you what

19

is your opinion of a practical approach to this problem in

Oklahoma, say.

21

MR. EISENBERG:

The practical approach to the

22

problem is to look at the statute that says you have a

23

year.

24

whatever you've got at the end of that year, you can take

25

to Federal court and be confident that it's exhausted.

If you file your petition within that year,

make the Federal successive petitions standard moot and

This statute of

It exists for a reason.

So if a -- if a

claim arises at a later point, after you have finished

11

your guaranteed review in State court, go back to State

12

court, whether or not you've got something pending in

13

Federal court.

14

claims in Federal court because then you have a mixed

15

petition.

16

you're timely or untimely, you're going to exhaust.

17

can then go back to Federal court with a request for a

18

successive petition.

19

that's appropriate because that's how Congress set up the

20

statute, with the 1-year filing deadline and -- and a

21

provision for successive petitions.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

whether or not the petition was timely in your view?

MR. EISENBERG:

It

Would there be

No, Your Honor, because all the

7

court is doing is deciding whether the time bar applies,

8

and in order -- in a State that has those kind of

9

categories, what the court is, in effect, doing is

10

deciding what kind of time limit applies to this

11

particular petition.

12
13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And even if it takes a year or

so to make that decision, you'd say no tolling.

Your Honor, that's really true

of every kind of statute of limitations issue that can

16

come up.

17

MR. EISENBERG:

That's right because during that

in Artuz that the application was -- if it turns out later

it was timely, it would have been properly filed?

9

MR. EISENBERG:

I'm sorry.

I -- I think I

10

understand Artuz to have said that if the application was

11

untimely, then it was not properly filed and it was not

12

properly filed from the get-go, Your Honor.

13

The question that was reserved in Artuz is

14

whether something about exceptions changes that statement

15

in Artuz.

16

the kind of exceptions that were present in this case

17

changed the response.

18

And my response is that certainly nothing about

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but if I understand you

19

correctly, you're saying that even if it takes the judge 6

months to decide whether it was timely, if he ends up with

the conclusion that it was not timely, there would be no

22

tolling for that 6-month period.

Now, in Pennsylvania, of course, all you have to

ineffectiveness of post-conviction counsel are not

cognizable on Federal habeas review.

So not only did he wait 4 years when he had no

filing deadline impediments to come to court, but he then

raised in State court claims that he couldn't have turned

what was available to him, to the universe of claims that

were available to him after his initial round of State

14

post-conviction review.

inaction for 4 years and who even then spent another 3

years in State court on claims that he couldn't bring to

He

didn't think that was his claim when he filed his first

his claim was that his plea was involuntary.

That claim was litigated

on the first round of post-conviction review and the State

courts rejected it because of the transcript of the

colloquy.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID WYCOFF

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WYCOFF:

Several things.

First of all, the

11

respondent said that in the second petition Mr. Pace only

12

presented State law, ineffective assistance of post-

13

conviction claims, which are not Federal claims.

14

absolutely not true.

15

assistance of post-conviction counsel as a waiver-

16

overcoming mechanism not as a substantive claim for

17

relief.

18

ineffective assistance of counsel, and new facts which

19

needed to be exhausted under Third Circuit exhaustion law.

20

That's

He presented the ineffective

The substantive claims were due process claim,

Second, respondent suggested and -- and the

21

Third Circuit also suggested that State law somehow became

22

clear in mid-December 1997 when the Superior Court, which

23

is Pennsylvania's intermediate court, decided a case

24

called Alcorn.

25

time bar.

Alcorn was the first case to apply the

But the Third Circuit itself, after Alcorn in

52
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the Lambert case, held that the -- the statutory language

2

of the time bar is not dispositive and you have to exhaust

3

even if you don't meet one of the statutory exceptions

4

because the court may fashion judicial exceptions just

5

like they did for all the other procedural bar rules.

6

In fact, Pennsylvania in the Lambert case, in

7

their opposition to the certiorari petition in May of

8

1998, said that that's a correct statement of Pennsylvania

9

law, that there are judicially created exceptions,

10

including the miscarriage of justice exception which will

11

probably apply to the time bar, just like they applied to

12

the other statutory bars.

13

So Alcorn did not, even if it could have, since

14

it's an intermediate court, it did not clear up the state

15

of the law.

16

specific things that Mr. Pace alleged, which is the

17

miscarriage of justice exception under Pennsylvania law

18

and the illegal sentence exception, judicially created

19

exceptions to bar, were not rejected by the Pennsylvania

20

Supreme Court until July of -- I'm sorry -- August of

21

1999, which is -- by that time Mr. Pace was already out of

22

State court so those -- the law became clear in State

23

court after he was already done litigating.

24
25

The law did not become clear as to the

The Third Circuit did not actually find the
statutory language of the PCRA time bar dispositive of the

courts send people back to exhaust during this same time

period.

State law was unclear.

The district

State law appeared to

provide remedies and possible merits review.

State law was unclear, Third Circuit exhaustion law

required petitioners like Mr. Pace to go back and exhaust.

Because the

And he did exactly what the circuit law required of him.

11

And as a matter of equity, the court cannot punish someone.

12

A Federal court can't say, do X, and then after that person

13

does it, say, sorry, you're out of court.

14

and it shouldn't happen here.

15

It's not fair

As to statutory tolling, I just want to -- the

16

-- the Court I think can just easily decide this case just

17

by reaffirming the central holding of Artuz which is when

18

a State court allows you to file, gives your filing

19

judicial review, applies a bar rule on a claim-by-claim

20

basis, that was a condition to obtaining relief on claims

21

in the petition.

It's not a condition to filing the

22

petition itself.

And if the State court eventually holds

23

all your claims are barred, as they did in Artuz, the

24

petition is, nevertheless, properly filed and should toll
