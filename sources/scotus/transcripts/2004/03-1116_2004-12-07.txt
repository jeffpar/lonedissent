ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLINT BOLICK

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS IN 03-1274

10

MR. BOLICK:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:
For 124 years, as state power over alcohol has

11

ebbed and flowed, one principle has remained virtually

12

constant, that states may regulate alcohol by one set of

13

rules, not by two.

14

of-state wine, and only out-of-state wine, to the three­

15

tier system for closing the market to thousands of small

16

family-run wineries and their customers for the benefit of

17

a liquor distributor oligopoly.

18

New York and Michigan consigned out­

Discrimination is the core concern of the

19

Commerce Clause, and it sends a powerful signal that the

20

state is engaged, not in legitimate regulation, but in

21

economic protectionism.

22

distributors make a sweeping argument that this Court has

23

consistently rejected, that the Twenty-First Amendment

24

creates plenary state authority.

25

The states and the liquor

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, under your view, could

4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

the three-tier system, itself, be challenged by a New

2

Jersey wholesaler wanting to sell in New York, or a New

3

York wholesaler wanting to sell in New Jersey?

4

MR. BOLICK:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6
7

Yes, Justice Kennedy.
So, under your view, the whole

three-tier system has to go down?
MR. BOLICK:

No, Justice Kennedy.

So long as

8

the state does not discriminate against out-of-state

9

entities, it is free to, as this Court -­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, under my hypothetical.

11

I don't know exactly how -- the way it works, you have to

12

be a New York wholesaler to sell to a New York retailer.

13

Under your view, a New Jersey wholesaler could sell to a

14

New York retailer.

15

MR. BOLICK:

That is -- or a challenge, as you

16

ask the question, Justice Kennedy, could be mounted to

17

that, under the same theory that we're advocating here.

18

The state may have a different set of defenses that it

19

doesn't have here.

20
21

But -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But so far as -- the rationale

is the same.

22

MR. BOLICK:

The -­

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It seems to me that, under

24

your rationale, that that in-state licensing system has to

25

fall if there's a New Jersey wholesaler.

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MR. BOLICK:

It has to pass constitutional

muster.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And when you say there is no

4

precedent -- I mean, I think a much more modest claim than

5

you're making, the claim simply that a state cannot

6

discriminate against out-of-state liquor -- i.e., the

7

physical liquid -- which is really more modest and keeps

8

the three-tier effect -- now, your -- that claim, that

9

they couldn't do that, was really what was advanced in

10

Young's Market.

11

briefs presented that Court -- you could have written

12

those briefs.

13

articulated that more modest version very clearly, made a

14

tremendously strong case, that was not forbidden by

15

Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment.

16

squarely rejected it.

17

MR. BOLICK:

18

The

And the difficulty for you is, it

And this Court

Your Honor, Young's Market -- the

result in Young's Market was correct -­

19
20

I read the briefs in that case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

The result, I understand, you

could put on the basis of there being no discrimination.

21

MR. BOLICK:

Exactly.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Reading Justice Brandeis'

23

opinion, I can't believe that that was the basis for his

24

result.

25

MR. BOLICK:

The -- the cases that followed

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Young's Market and purported to apply its reasoning took a

2

very sweeping view of the Twenty-First Amendment.

3

Court began trenching on that very broad view immediately

4

in 1939.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

But why wasn't that broad

6

view appropriate, given the difference between the

7

language of the Wilson Act, which has had the words "to

8

the same extent and in the same manner," and the Webb­

9

Kenyon Act, which became the second section of the Twenty­

10

First Amendment, leaves out "to the same extent and the

11

same manner."

12

that the state can bar importation for delivery of, or use

13

therein, in violation of laws thereof."

14

"nondiscriminatory laws."

15

It just says that "alcoholic beverage so

MR. BOLICK:

It doesn't say

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, the -- there

16

was no need for the Webb-Kenyon Act to repeat the language

17

of the Wilson Act.

The Wilson Act dealt with the question

18

of discrimination.

The Webb-Kenyon Act dealt with

19

questions that arose subsequent to the enactment of the

20

Wilson Act.

21

And as this Court has held in Craig versus -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, maybe that's the Act,

22

but when they put it in the Constitution, why didn't they

23

adopt the language, "to the same extent and in the same

24

manner"?

25

MR. BOLICK:

I think the reason for that is

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

because it was so obvious that the state could not, prior

2

to prohibition, discriminate.

3

the Wilson Act, but it was embodied in at least three

4

cases of this Court.

5

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It was not only embodied in

But it was not obvious to the

6

person who at least drafted the Webb-Kenyon in the first

7

instance, because as I -- as I understand it, there was an

8

anti-discrimination provision, and that was then dropped.

9

And do we know why it was dropped?

10
11

MR. BOLICK:

It was dropped essentially because

it was redundant.

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, but is that a -- is that

13

on a legislative history record somewhere?

14

that?

15

MR. BOLICK:

Do we know

No, Justice Souter, that is not

16

expressly on the record.

What is on the record, however,

17

is that the Court was aiming -- or, excuse me, the

18

Congress was aiming at specific Supreme Court decisions.

19

There -- and it -- and the one case that was clearest on

20

point on discrimination was Scott versus Donald, applying

21

both the Commerce Clause and the Wilson Act to forbid

22

discrimination.

23

legislative history to indicate that Congress intended to

24

overturn that decision.

25

Craig versus Boren, and elsewhere, by enacting the Twenty­

And there was -- there is nothing in the

And as this Court has held in

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

First Amendment, Congress clearly intended to incorporate

2

both the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon Act and to restore

3

to the states the police power that they had before

4

prohibition.

5

of that police power.

6

Emphatically, discrimination was not a part
It was a very accepted context.

So, too, is it today.

When the -- when the

7

liquor distributors in the states asked this Court to

8

overturn the Bacchus decision and to adopt a plenary view

9

of the Twenty-First Amendment, it is not just asking you

10

to overturn the Bacchus decision; it is asking you to

11

overturn cases starting with the Midcal decision in 1980,

12

the more recent Healy decision, and others, that have held

13

that the core purposes of the Commerce Clause and the

14

Twenty-First Amendment must be harmonized, that the

15

Commerce Clause was never intended to be obliterated.

16

And when you look at the core values of the two

17

clauses, they do not clash.

18

Commerce Clause is nondiscrimination.

19

the Twenty-First Amendment is temperance.

20

a discriminatory statute, it sends a very strong signal

21

that, in fact -­

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Under -­
-- what do you make of the

5

argument that there's no practical way, except at great

6

expense, to audit compliance if they're out of state?

7

MR. BOLICK:

Justice Souter, this is one of the

8

most regulated industries in America, of course, and the

9

model legislation that has been adopted by a number of

10

states includes record-keeping provisions, it requires

11

that wineries -­

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, I will grant that's

13

required, but the argument, as I understand it, is, to

14

find out whether they're doing what they are required to

15

do, you've got to drop in unexpectedly and make an audit.

16

And that's one thing in the state; it's another thing

17

across the country.

18

MR. BOLICK:

No, it's important to recognize,

19

Justice Souter, that under the three-tier system, which is

20

-- which is where the states of New York and Michigan are

21

saying that the other state wineries have to go -- the

22

three-tier system does not do that.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We are here today because a majority of states

have chosen to regulate wine distinctively.

of them, including Michigan and New York, have chosen to

do so in a discriminatory manner.

15

not discriminate, in terms of direct shipping with regard

to other alcohol -- and they don't; there's a flat

prohibition across the United States, in terms of beer and

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS IN 03-1116 AND 03-1120

please the Court:
Nothing in today's case, Justice Kennedy,

3

requires you to take on the three-tier system, for the

4

issue that is presented here is a very narrow one.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it's very narrow, but

6

the rationale is sweeping, and that's why I asked.

I just

7

don't know if the in-state licensure system, which is the

8

cornerstone of the three-tier distribution system, can

9

survive under your rationale, assuming the hypothetical

10

where a New Jersey wholesaler has all of the -- you know,

11

the physical facilities and so forth that the New York

12

wholesaler does.

13

MS. SULLIVAN:

14

Justice Kennedy, is that you strike down Michigan and New

-- producers of wine -­
-- but you're -- all you're

asking is for a rationale that's sweeping.
MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Kennedy, in our case, we

22

want to suggest that it is -- just as in Healy and Bacchus

23

-- that a law that discriminates in favor of in-state

24

producers and against out-of-state producers loses its

25

immunity afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment.

As

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Justice Scalia said in concurrence in Healy, a liquor

2

law's discriminatory character eliminates the immunity

3

afforded by the Twenty-First Amendment.

4

It's really the state's position, aided by their

5

wholesaler allies, that it is the sweeping one.

Their

6

position is that every state law that regulates the

7

importation of liquor is, per se, valid if it has any

8

conceivable rational connection to a state purpose.

for example, if Michigan wanted to simply bar all

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Your answer to Justice

14

Kennedy, I glean from what you said, that if New York took

15

away the direct-sale privilege that in-state wineries get,

16

then out-of-state wineries wouldn't be any better off, but

17

they'd have nothing to complain about.

18

MS. SULLIVAN:

That's exactly correct, Justice

19

Ginsburg.

As you've said in the context of gender

discrimination, you can cure an equal-protection problem

by leveling up or leveling down.

Now, maybe -- I think that's

But -­
And if he is, and even if he

isn't, why isn't that right?
MS. SULLIVAN:

Justice Breyer, the Young's

8

Market language permitting state discrimination is,

9

indeed, broad, but it's been superceded by 40 years of

10

this Court's jurisprudence harmonizing the Twenty-First

11

Amendment with the rest of the Constitution.

12

Justice Brandeis, in Young's Market, didn't even think the

13

Equal Protection Clause applied to liquor imports, a

14

position that's inconsistent with Craig against Boren.

15

And nobody would suggest today that equal protection

16

permits a state to import only from male-owned wineries or

17

only import wine from white-owned wineries.

Remember,

18

So there -- the 40 years of jurisprudence -­

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MS. SULLIVAN:

Commerce Clause.
MS. SULLIVAN:

Correct, Your Honor, but if -- if

24

there were a law -- the states are claiming that any law

JUSTICE STEVENS:

importation, either.

3

MS. SULLIVAN:

But the dormant Commerce Clause

4

reflects a fundamental structural principle that is every

5

bit as much a part of the Constitution as the Equal

6

Protection Clause upheld in Craig v. Boren.

7

Court, in cases from McCulloch to the Eleventh Amendment

8

cases and state sovereignty cases, has recognized that a

9

principle of the Constitution is no less fundamental

10

because it is a structural implication of the text.

11

the dormant Commerce Clause stands on the same footing as

12

the affirmative power of Congress and on -- it's the same

13

footing as the Equal Protection Clause at issue -­

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

15

MS. SULLIVAN:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17

Indeed this

So

Do you think Congress -­

-- in Craig v. Boren -­
-- could enact a statute

authorizing the states to do just what they've done here?

18

MS. SULLIVAN:

Absolutely, but it has not.

And

19

the Wilson Act -- to go back to Justice Souter's question

20

and Justice Ginsburg's question -- Congress could

21

authorize it as it has done, for example, in the McCarran­

22

Ferguson Act, allowing the states to discriminate against

23

out-of-state industry with respect to the industry of

24

insurance.

25

authorize discrimination, and the Wilson Act forbade

It has not done so here.

Webb-Kenyon did not

the same manner as local liquor laws.

4

purpose of Section 2 was to allow to the dry states to

5

keep dry by preventing all those original packages from

6

piling up in the railway stations and being open to

7

bootleggers throughout the state, undermining the dry

8

policies of the state.

9

Web Kenyan didn't authorize it.

It said you may regulate imports of liquor in
And, of course, the

Wilson forbade discrimination.

10

And in Congress' most recent articulation of its

11

view of the harmony between the Twenty-First Amendment and

12

the rest of the Constitution, the Twenty-First Amendment

13

Enforcement Act, passed in 2000, enacted in 2000, Congress

14

has a rules-of-construction section that says, "We view

15

any state plea to the federal courts to enforce their laws

16

as reflecting the jurisprudence of this court."

17

fact, floor debate on that rules-of-construction section

18

reflected allusions to Bacchus, Healy, and the other cases

19

that said dormant commerce -- the negative implications of

20

the Commerce Clause, no less than the Equal Protection

21

Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Establishment

22

Clause, constrain the states in their regulation of

23

importation of liquor.

And, in

24

So with all respect to Justice Brandeis, Justice

25

Breyer, the Young's Market statements about discrimination

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

have been superceded.
What New York and Michigan have done here is say

3

that one set of exceptions apply only to in-state

4

producers, just as Connecticut, in Healy, said, "If you

5

just sell beer within our state, you don't have to face

6

price ceilings that you have to face if you do business

7

over in Massachusetts or Rhode Island."

8

Bacchus, the -- you struck down a decision -- an excise

9

tax exemption that said, "If you're an importer of liquor,

Just as in

10

you have to pay an excise tax, but if you're a local

11

producer of locally produced wine and spirits, you get out

12

of that restriction."

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, we've got one difference

14

from Bacchus, because the claim that's being made here,

15

which I gather was not made, or made seriously, in

16

Bacchus, is there really is a need for differential

treatment for purposes of enforcement.

But to go back to the physical-presence

2

question, Justice Souter, Michigan is not now -- Michigan

3

officials are not now traipsing up to the upper peninsula

4

and all around the state to inspect wineries.

5

is clear on that.

6

wineries in Michigan send samples and records to their

7

offices.

8

states say that the Internet increases the danger, but the

9

Internet also increases, in parallel, the power of the

What Michigan does is require that

every speaker with a PC a town crier, as you said -­

Just as, Justice Stevens, the Internet may make

13

JUSTICE SOUTER:

14

MS. SULLIVAN:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

16

MS. SULLIVAN:

17
18

Could -­

-- in Reno versus ACLU --- could a state -­

-- so it makes every interstate

-JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- could a state require an

19

out-of-state winery to keep its books online, subject to a

20

password, so that, with a password, they could go in and

21

audit the books across the country, by wire?

22

MS. SULLIVAN:

Yes, Justice Souter, if it were

23

part of a -- an agreement to a permit that the -- that the

24

out-of-state winery is willing to make, then there's no

25

extraterritorial regulation there, that would be just

25
Alderson Reporting Company

fine.

So, yes, the state can, through Internet, so to

2

speak, -- Internet monitoring, through virtual monitoring

3

-- do all the work it needs to do to make sure that the

4

out-of-state winery is paying taxes.

5

And, by the way, Michigan does not collect

6

taxes, Justice Kennedy, through the distributors.

7

Michigan collects taxes from the wineries, whether they're

8

in-state or whether they're out-of-state wine shippers.

9

So Michigan can give no justification for why out-of-state

10

wineries have to go through the distributors for tax

11

purposes.

12

tax-collection agents now.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They're not using the distributors as their

3

But to return to the key point here, Michigan

4

and New York may not facially discriminate in favor of

5

their own producers unless they can show that reasonable

6

nondiscriminatory alternatives are unavailable.

7

Justice Souter, on any standard of heightened scrutiny,

they have not come close to making that kind of showing,

9

because there are all these other means -- means that have

10

been recognized by the 26 states that don't discriminate,

statement you made earlier, that the Bacchus case didn't

to come next is, if you say yes, I'm going to say, "Well,

didn't it pass that law with the Wilson Act?"

18

MS. HALLIGAN:

Let me answer both of those

19

questions, if I can, Your Honor.

Certainly, this Court

20

has held, repeatedly, that the Twenty-First Amendment did

21

not, in any substantial way, completely repeal Congress'

22

affirmative power under the Commerce Clause.

23

in Midcal and Capital Cities.

24

Congress acted in a way which completely removed state

authority to determine whether or not alcohol could be

2

example, if Congress said all states must be dry -- then

3

we would argue that the Twenty-First Amendment wouldn't

4

allow that, because that would completely eviscerate any

5

state authority.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

How can that be?

I mean, if

7

this is a constitutional elimination of the Commerce

8

Clause, how can Congress bring it back in simply by

9

enacting a statute?

10

MS. HALLIGAN:

The legislative history makes

11

clear that the Twenty-First Amendment was intended to

12

eliminate the impediments posed by the dormant Commerce

13

Clause and authorize states to regulate it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you -- you want us to read

it by its terms.

poses unique risks to the regulatory regime, because the

state can't bring the alcohol within the full extent of

MS. HALLIGAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

The state

liquor authority has not issued any regulations on this,

13

but presumably what they would say is, you could share a

space, provided that the physical property of each winery,

15

the bottles, is segregated so that the states can come in

and check whether or not each winery's products conform

with their records.

There are other reasons why a physical presence

JUSTICE SOUTER:

We seem to be talking -- may I

just ask one -- we seem to be talking about two different

things.

Justice Scalia was assuming that, if you have the

10

license and some in-state warehouse, you can ship from

11

outside.

12

argument that New York can require -- does require the in­

13

state warehouse, and you can ship into -- in New York, you

14

can ship only from that warehouse?

with the state liquor authority, they have made it clear

that their intent would be to require that the liquor come

first to the in-state premises -­

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, even if -- I'm willing to

assume that.

How does that guarantee that the out-of-

That, I would respectfully

It does operate as a powerful deterrent

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, your argument there is

that -­

15

MS. HALLIGAN:

-- as an investigative aid.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- if they break the law, you

17

can shut down the warehouse; whereas, you can't

18

effectively do that if the warehouse is in California.

19

Isn't that your point?

20

MS. HALLIGAN:

That's one of the points, but

21

also that we're much more likely to be able to identify

22

the illegal activities in the first place.

23

that we would send inspectors to California or any other

24

place to look at books and count bottles is completely

25

infeasible.

-- to what extent does New

York take account of, say, the rigorous regulation in the

10

states from which this wine is coming?

You say we must do

11

this to police for all kinds of things.

But don't other

12

states -- California, Virginia -- don't they have laws

13

that their local wineries must meet?

14

MS. HALLIGAN:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And is New York just saying,

16

"We're going to treat this thing as though it's totally

17

unregulated, anyway"?

18

MS. HALLIGAN:

We're not suggesting that, Your

19

Honor.

What we are suggesting is that relying on other

20

states to enforce law violations in New York State is not

21

a very feasible alternative.

22

states that have agreed with New York, a number of whom

23

are states that have either reciprocal or unrestricted

24

shipping statutes, and said to this Court, "Please do not

25

prohibit the kinds of laws that are at issue in New York

Additionally, there are 33

Alderson Reporting Company

So it's obviously important to the

regulators in those states, as well.

56
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Twenty-First Amendment requires the states to demonstrate

2

is that the regulatory regime that they have chosen has

some relationship to their goals of protecting the

integrity of the state's system.

what the Court suggested in North Dakota.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's certainly

Well, I'm not sure.

When you

7

have facial discrimination against out-of-state products,

I think you're -- the bar is a little higher than that.

MS. HALLIGAN:

Well, that was the case in North

12

onerous, so onerous that some vendors said they wouldn't

true here.

Justice O'Connor, you also asked about Bacchus,

as well, and I would like to take a moment to address

that.

22

Bacchus is distinguishable in several ways.

23

First of all, Bacchus was a tax.

And while we would argue

24

that taxes could be used to further states' interest in

25

suppressing consumption, for example, it is certainly not

57
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

1

at the heart of the -- of the Twenty-First Amendment in

2

the way that the direct regulation of alcohol across the

3

border is.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but if you can't grant a

5

tax exemption -- and it seems to me, a fortiori -- you

6

can't grant a prohibition about importing at all.

7

MS. HALLIGAN:

I, respectfully, would disagree

8

with that, Your Honor.

If you can't address the alcohol

9

that flows across the border, which was precisely why the

10

Twenty-First Amendment was enacted, as well as Webb­

11

Kenyon, because the -­

12
13
14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, I'm suggesting a tax on

imports is less restrictive than a prohibition on imports.
MS. HALLIGAN:

Well, we would certainly, you

15

know, welcome the authority to do both, but importation is

16

what is at the heart of the Twenty-First Amendment.

17

Bacchus is also different, because, there, the state made

18

no effort whatsoever to defend the statute with reference

19

to any concerns related to the Twenty-First Amendment.

20

And Bacchus -­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And according to the District

22

Court, in this very case, the State Attorney General

23

conceded that New York's measure allowing direct sales by

24

in-state wineries was designed to benefit local farmers.

25

MS. HALLIGAN:

That was an off-the-cuff remark

58
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

by a single attorney, Your Honor, and that can't be taken

as dispositive, given the state's vigorous defense of this

3

statute.

even directly before the Court right now which confers no

different shipment privileges than are conferred on any

winery, whether in-state or out-of-state, that would

They can, if

they issue a permit, revoke that permit.

And New York has

authority to issue such permits under Section 105-9.

Twenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act, for which the

liquor distributors and states lobbied very hard, gives
