CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 04-340, San Remo Hotel v. the City and County

5

of San Francisco.

6

Mr. Utrecht, is that --

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL UTRECHT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. UTRECHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit decision in this case should

12
13
14
15

be reversed for three reasons.
The first reason is that the result is unfair
and the rationale of the court is unfair.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what are your --

16

exactly what claims are -- is your client now raising in

17

Federal court?

18

decide if something is unfair.

19

claims your client is raising now in Federal court?

20

I mean, we don't take a case to just

MR. UTRECHT:

What are the precise

My client is making a facial and

21

as-applied takings challenge to both the hotel conversion

22

ordinance and the regulatory scheme of which it is a part.

23

And that claim -- that Federal --

24
25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I somehow thought that your

question had boiled down to whether there was issue

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

preclusion here.

Am I wrong?

MR. UTRECHT:

The issue before this Court is

whether there's issue preclusion -JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I'm talking about the issues

in this Court.
MR. UTRECHT:

Okay.

The issue in this Court is

7

whether the Federal takings claim should be precluded

8

under issue preclusion by a State court judgment that did

9

not decide the Federal takings claim and could not have

10

decided the Federal takings claim.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, as I understand, I -- I

12

would -- I will grant you that there are moments in the --

13

in the Ninth Circuit opinion in which there seems to be a

14

shift back and forth in the rhetoric between claim

15

preclusion and issue preclusion.

16

the Ninth Circuit held, it did not hold that your claim

17

was necessarily out of court because of claim preclusion.

18

It held that your claim failed because of the effect of

19

issue preclusion on elements that were common, factual

20

elements common to both the claim in the State court and

21

the claim that you sought to bring in the Federal court.

22

Am -- am I correct about that, about what the Ninth

23

Circuit held?

24
25

MR. UTRECHT:

But as I understand what

The Ninth Circuit did limit its

holding to issue preclusion.

It did not rule on claim

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

preclusion.

2

JUSTICE SOUTER:

3

MR. UTRECHT:

Okay.

The other part of your question

4

about whether it was based on factual determinations could

5

not have been based on factual determinations.

6

it was based on the prior State court determination that

7

we did not state a claim -- state a cause of action under

8

California law for State compensation.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Instead,

Well, the Supreme

10

Court of California decided only the State constitutional

11

question, did it not?

12

MR. UTRECHT:

13

And because of that, we have never had an

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

opportunity to have our Federal takings claim decided on

15

the merits.

16

courts' primacy in deciding Federal questions,

17

particularly Federal constitutional questions.

18

believe --

19

We believe that that undermines the Federal

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

We also

Well, it was this Court's

20

decision in the Williamson County case that led you and I

21

assume other lawyers in these takings cases to return to

22

State court and try to litigate everything.

23

right?

24
25

MR. UTRECHT:

Isn't that

This Court in Williamson County

said that before you could bring a Federal takings claim,

5
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

you had to go to State court and seek compensation under

2

State law.

3
4
5
6

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

revisit that Williamson County case, have you?
MR. UTRECHT:

We have not asked that this Court

reconsider the decision in Williamson County.

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

8

MR. UTRECHT:

9

And you haven't asked us to

that we can.

Maybe you should have.

Well, at this point I don't think

Perhaps we could have in 1998 when the Ninth

10

Circuit applied the Williamson County case and ordered us

11

to go to State court with our unripe Federal claims,

12

unripe under this Court's holding in Williamson.

13

But I think that at this point the question

14

before the Court is given that we've complied with the

15

procedural requirements that this Court established in

16

Williamson County, are we now precluded by issue

17

preclusion in the second litigation that this Court

18

ordered because of the State court compensation ruling.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Utrecht, you -- you refer

20

to the primacy of Federal courts.

21

to whether you are arguing for a different disposition

22

where a suit is first brought in Federal court erroneously

23

because there's been no exhaustion and then the plaintiff

24

is sent back to State court from the situation in which a

25

plaintiff does the right thing and goes to State court

I'm -- I'm not clear as

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

immediately.

2

argue for primacy of the Federal court?

3

Now, in that case, would -- would you still

MR. UTRECHT:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

I think

4

that what this Court established in Williamson County is a

5

two separate litigation scheme.

6

concerns State compensation, and the second litigation

7

concerns the Federal takings claim.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

The first litigation

So -- so your case does not

hinge on the fact that when the State court acted, there

10

was a pending -- a pending Federal case asking for the

11

Federal constitutional question to be resolved by a

12

Federal court.

13

MR. UTRECHT:

That's correct.

I think that the

14

Second Circuit got this issue correct in the Santini case

15

when it concluded that whether you started in Federal

16

court and were ordered to proceed to State court under

17

Williamson County or you looked at the Williamson County

18

case and said, I'm going to start in State court because

19

that's what Williamson County says that I'm required to

20

do, it doesn't matter.

21

of issue preclusion on the Federal takings claim once it

22

has been made ripe under the procedures required by

23

Williamson County.

24
25

It shouldn't matter for purposes

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it your position that

issue preclusion doesn't apply at all, or that there was

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

no issue decided in the State court proceeding that

2

carries over into the Federal proceeding?

3

it?

4

facts were found.

5

sufficient statements to survive a 12(b)(6) or its

6

counterpart dismissal motion.

Which one is

What -- you suggested -- you said, number one, no

7

The question was whether there was

MR. UTRECHT:

Our -- our primary position is

8

that issue preclusion does not apply for the same reasons

9

that this Court found that issue preclusion did not apply

10

in England when you were required to do two separate

11

litigations.

12

correctly applied issue preclusion law -- we also raise

13

that as our last argument in our opening brief, but our

14

primary argument here today is that issue preclusion

15

should not apply at all to Federal --

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17

The question of whether the Ninth Circuit

And if it did -- if it did

apply, what issues would be precluded?

18

MR. UTRECHT:

In our position no issue should be

19

precluded because under California law, which the Ninth

20

Circuit was obligated to apply, only identical issues that

21

are resolved under a different set of laws can be

22

precluded in the second proceeding, and there was no

23

identical issue finding by the Ninth Circuit.

24

the Ninth Circuit applied its equivalent determination

25

finding.

Instead,

8
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

But I think that the -- the real issue before

2

this Court is not the California preclusion law question,

3

but the real issue is whether this Court's decision in

4

England should -- or the rationale of this Court's

5

decision in England should be applied to the very similar

6

circumstances raised by --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

Is -- excuse me.

Is -- is it

your position that there is an exaction here?

9

MR. UTRECHT:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It -- are -- are you bound by

11

a finding in the State court that there was no exaction,

12

or was there no such finding?

13

MR. UTRECHT:

I don't believe there was such a

14

finding.

15

decided that the exaction met the State law compensation

16

requirements and did not --

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that the California Supreme Court

Was the -- was the Ninth

18

Circuit wrong in indicating that there was no exaction?

19

That's the way I read its opinion.

20

MR. UTRECHT:

I -- I don't read the Ninth

21

Circuit's opinion as saying there was no exaction.

22

think the Ninth Circuit held that the exaction was imposed

23

by legislation rather than by an administrative

24

proceeding, and because of that, it was subject to a

25

different standard than exactions imposed in

I

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

administrative proceedings.

2

But I think there's no question in this case

3

that an -- an exaction was imposed and was actually paid.

4

This is not a -- this is not a case where there's an issue

5

about whether the exaction was imposed.

6

what standard was used to review that exaction and whether

7

the exaction was constitutional.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The issues were

But -- but the Ninth Circuit

seemed to think that Dolan doesn't apply, and I take it

10

that you would say that it does.

11

MR. UTRECHT:

Well, I think this Court has not

12

decided whether exactions imposed by legislation are

13

treated differently than exactions imposed by

14

administrative proceedings.

15

determined that under State compensation law that

16

mattered.

17

Circuit seemed to indicate that it was in general

18

agreement with the California Supreme Court, but again,

19

because it didn't actually decide the merits, it just

20

decided that there was an equivalent determination under

21

State law, it didn't get to the final question of whether

22

this was an exaction and what the proper standard was.

23
24
25

The State court in this case

But this Court has not decided that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Ninth

And you don't want us get that

-- to that question either, whether Dolan applies or not.
MR. UTRECHT:

I did want this Court to get to

10
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that question, but when this Court rejected question 2, I

2

think this Court decided that it did not want to get to

3

that question.

4

question because this Court did not grant certiorari on

5

question number 2.

6

to decide that question, and obviously, if -- since the

7

Court can't decide it in this case, we would, obviously,

8

want the Court to decide it in some other case, hopefully

9

before this case is finally resolved in the courts.

10

But we -- and we did not brief that

But we definitely did want this Court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Utrecht, if I understand

11

the respondents' brief correctly, there is on pages 10 and

12

11 a whole list of issues that they say were determined --

13

raised, litigated, and determined in the State court.

14

for example, that the HCO's housing replacement fees bear

15

a reasonable relationship to loss of housing, the use of a

16

defined historical measure -- measurement point reasonably

17

related to the HCO's -- and it goes on for a paragraph,

18

citing issues that respondents say -- says were raised,

19

litigated, and decided in the California Supreme Court.

20

MR. UTRECHT:

So,

I think that technically what the

21

California Supreme Court decided was that our facts did

22

not state a cause of action under State law.

23

cite here as findings are actually discussions of the

24

legal issues raised by the State court complaint under

25

State law.

What they

They don't amount to a factual finding.

There

11
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

was no trial.

2

There was no evidence presented on any of these points.

3

These are --

4
5

There was no summary judgment motion.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
up?

How did the case go

On a motion to dismiss?

6

MR. UTRECHT:

The case in State court went up on

7

a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court,

8

reversed by the State court of appeal, and then affirmed

9

by the California Supreme Court.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So, in effect, then maybe --

11

are you saying this, that there is no issue preclusion

12

here because the -- the ruling that there was no statement

13

of a cause of action was, in fact, a disposition of the

14

claim without there being any resolution of any fact issue

15

upon which the claim might depend.

16

saying?

17

why there is no issue preclusion?

18

Is that what you're

And therefore -- and -- and that is the reason

MR. UTRECHT:

Is that your argument?

That's not the argument that we

19

made in this Court.

20

the lower courts.

21

Court is rather that under the England case -- or rather,

22

the rationale of the England case, there shouldn't be any

23

issue preclusion whether or not the State courts made any

24

factual findings.

25

framed by Your Honor is presented by the briefs.

That is an argument that we made in
The argument that we're making in this

I don't think that the question as
I mean,

12
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

obviously, that was a contention of ours.

2

a correct statement of how the case should have been

3

resolved by the Ninth Circuit, but the Ninth Circuit

4

instead chose not to look at that issue or not to decide

5

the case on that issue, but instead to decide under its

6

prior precedents of Dodd and Palomar, that issue

7

preclusion applied and then applied its own formulation of

8

the equivalent --

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We think that's

But -- but isn't there an

10

essential step to find out that there were issues?

11

Because I think the way you're phrasing the question, it

12

says, if there were issues decided, they weren't

13

precluded.

14

not what's involved in this case.

15

which you could knock out issue preclusion is that no

16

issues were decided.

But if there are no issues, that's -- that's
The simplest ground on

17

MR. UTRECHT:

That would be a simple route to

18

knocking out the case.

The Ninth Circuit rejected that

19

argument.

20
21
22

That question did not seem cert-worthy and -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what were the issues

that the Ninth Circuit thought were decided?
MR. UTRECHT:

I can't quite tell.

I think what

23

the Ninth Circuit said was that because State law and

24

Federal law on this question was similar, at least in the

25

Ninth Circuit's understanding, that the State court

13
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

determination was an equivalent determination.

2

made that finding, that there was an equivalent

3

determination under State law, the Ninth Circuit decided

4

that the claim must be precluded by issue preclusion.

5
6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Once they

Well, issue preclusion does

extend to questions of law, as well as fact.

7

MR. UTRECHT:

It does extend to questions of

8

law.

9

question of law that was decided was whether our -- we

10

were entitled to compensation under State compensation

11

law.

12

entitled to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment.

13
14

The problem, of course, is that the State court

The State court did not decide whether we were

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought they said that their

-- their compensation law was congruent with ours?

15

MR. UTRECHT:

16

say that its compensation law --

17
18
19

The California Supreme Court did

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What do you -- what do you

think that means?
MR. UTRECHT:

I think that means that the

20

California Supreme Court would like to believe that its

21

law is congruent with this Court's decisions.

22

I think that, in fact, the California Supreme

23

Court does not follow this Court's precedents in this area

24

of law, and I think we actually argued the first time that

25

we were in front of the Ninth Circuit, that it was futile

14
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to go to State court precisely for that reason.

2

argument was also rejected by the Ninth Circuit.

3

that it cannot be that the State courts are going to be

4

the -- our final arbiter of whether their law is in fact

5

congruent with Federal law or not.

6

Court --

7
8

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

That
I think

It left either to this

What do you understand

the word congruent to mean?

9

MR. UTRECHT:

I think congruent means that it's

10

equivalent.

11

of an equivalent determination is that it's close.

12

close enough for government work, perhaps.

I think -- I think the Ninth Circuit's view

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's

What -- what is the claim you

15

want to make?

16

court opinion says you came into their court and you said,

17

look, this ordinance in San Francisco violates the Fifth

18

Amendment, I guess, because it doesn't make any sense.

19

The -- there's no good basis, no sound basis for requiring

20

us to pay a fee in order to convert rooms.

11
12

You're wrong because it does help

Now, what else is it you want to raise in
Federal court?

13

MR. UTRECHT:

I think that what's important is

14

the very beginning of your question.

15

said in State court that it violated the Fifth Amendment.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You said that we

I don't know if you said it.

I

17

just said that that is what I read in the California

18

Supreme Court opinion that Justice Werdegar wrote.

19

what I'm asking you is whether they should have or whether

20

they shouldn't have, they did seem to decide those five

21

issues.

22

want to raise?

23

And so

And so my question to you is, what else do you

MR. UTRECHT:

The California Supreme Court

24

decided whether those legal propositions were relevant

25

under the State constitution and the State compensation --

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought it decided a

2

different thing.

3

that was the reason for their decision.

4

they reached their decision is they thought on each of

5

those five matters that the City of San Francisco had a

6

reasonable legislative purpose for its ordinance.

7
8
9

I thought that it decided that in part

MR. UTRECHT:
State law.

But the reason

And they made that decision under

They -- they --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just as, suppose, for example,

10

they had decided that the hotel clerk or the temporary

11

manager did speak English, and in fact, he was a scholar

12

of English.

13

for its decision of State law.

14

into Federal court, even if the issue were quite

15

different, you would be bound by that factual

16

determination.

17

And suppose that that had been the key matter
I take it, if you came

That's why I'm asking you.

It seems to me here

18

they have decided matters of whether there was a

19

reasonable purpose or not for this particular ordinance

and as applied to you.

22

just described?

MR. UTRECHT:

Now, what else do you want to

Honor gave of a factual determination that the clerk spoke

English well, that fact under the England case and under

MR. UTRECHT:

Well, in this particular case,

they found that the facts that we alleged did not give

rise to a right to compensation under State law.

compensation in State court, once it's certain that the

State courts will not provide you relief under State law,

7

you have a ripe Federal takings claim.

And this

At that point, the Federal courts must be able
to look at the factual questions underpinning the Federal

10

takings analysis, so that the questions of whether in fact

11

this law substantially advances a legitimate government

interest or it interferes unduly with the reasonable

13

investment-backed expectations under Penn Central, which

14

requires a detailed ad hoc factual analysis, that that

must be done by the Federal courts and cannot be precluded

by a State court determination that is not considering the

The court did not find that they

The court found

that under State compensation law, which it believed was

congruent with this Court's decision in Penn Central --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, I can understand how you

should be free to argue that in fact the two rules are not

But if we decided that the two -- if we agreed

I think that's correct, Mr. Chief

The Williamson County case says that you have to

go to State court and use the State procedures available

12

through the appellate procedure provided by the State

You cannot do that without going

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Do you think

Williamson County by its terms spoke of going to State

17

proceeding?

18

MR. UTRECHT:

As -- as I read the Williamson

19

County opinion, it says that you have to use the State

20

procedures that are available to obtain compensation.

21

the State procedures in California are an inverse

22

condemnation claim under State law, i.e., a State

23

compensation claim, which, as I read Williamson County --

24

and I think all the other practitioners of takings law

25

read Williamson County -- means that you have to go to

Now, it is possible that a State could have an

in order to decide takings claim -- rather, to decide

State compensation claims.

8

then that perhaps is what Williamson County envisioned

9

that you would follow.

If there were such an

But I think Williamson County says

10

exhaust that and obtain a denial from the State of your

Now, they -- their case here boils down -- and

it's quite clear from their reply brief, and Mr. Utrecht

to the Louisiana courts first for determination, there was

3

no doubt that issue preclusion was going to apply to that.

The question was whether or not principles of preclusion

5

would bar them from coming back to Federal court

6

otherwise.

In other words, in England, the question --

there was a challenge by chiropractors to a State law that

MR. WAXMAN:

abstained under the Pullman doctrine which, as this Court

which Williamson County requires that a party resort first

to take a very deep breath before I told the Court that it

was not open to the Court to reconsider just about

4

anything that touched on it.

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I think it would be -It -- frankly, it isn't clear

6

to me that the Court ever contemplated just cutting off

7

any determination in Federal court of takings claims in

the way that it seems to work out by application of

Williamson County.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Let me explain why I think it would

be imprudent for the Court to resolve it and then explain

12

why I think it's fair to say that the Court didn't

13

consider one way or the other principles of preclusion in

14

application of the Full Faith and Credit Act in Williamson

15

County.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

So what's a takings claimant supposed

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think it would be imprudent

22

to decide -- I -- I think that the Court will have to

elaborate on the Williamson County requirement and how the

this argument, I'll be able to participate in some way in

10

do think, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, that the

California Supreme Court -- I'm sorry -- the Ninth Circuit

12

made clear that it was applying California preclusion law.

13

It cited the California Supreme -- a -- California

14

authorities, and it correctly recited the elements of the

15

California preclusion law in this regard.

16

It did make reference to its prior determination

17

in Dodd v. Hood River, which was an Oregon case, in which

18

the Ninth Circuit decided that an England reservation in

19

the Williamson County context was effective with respect

20

to claim preclusion but not issue preclusion.

respect -- and this I think goes back to Justice

22

O'Connor's question about, you know, what -- what could we

have been thinking or not thinking in Williamson County --

the -- the Dodd case provides a pretty good example.

Williamson County context, there would not be claim

preclusion.

5

therefore if they litigated both their State claim and

barred both by issue and claim preclusion.

We think it shouldn't be extended, and

Of course, they could have come

I mean, maybe that was their mistake in

But I think, Justice Scalia, more to your point

3

about what actually happened here, I think that a very

good argument -- I -- I don't think that there's really

5

much doubt that if they had petitioned for certiorari from

6

the California Supreme Court decision, you could easily

7

have granted review under Zacchini and Michigan v. Long

8

and Ruiz because the California Supreme Court said, to be

9

sure we are deciding only the State constitutional

10

question.

11

they made very clear that, whatever congruent means --

12

they made very clear that they looked to this Court's

13

statements and expositions about the meaning of the Fifth

14

Amendment to construe the claims the same.

15

We are not ruling on the Fifth Amendment.

But

And as this Court said in Ohio v. Reiner, I

16

think 2 years ago, when a State court's interpretation of

17

State law has been influenced by an accompanying

18

interpretation of Federal law, we may review.

19

fact, if you think about it, think of almost every takings

20

case that you've decided since Williamson County.

That was a case that was filed in the district court and

litigated in the district court.

presents the question on which you granted review because

8

their -- the theory that they have pursued in State court

9

and at this round in Federal court is that there is a

And it raises a real

10

takings violation under both the State and the Federal

11

Constitution under the so-called substantially advances

12

prong.

13

but their briefs in the lower court -- in the lower

14

Federal courts in this proceeding and in the State courts

15

don't discuss Penn Central at all, as the California

16

Supreme Court in footnote 14 of its opinion explained.

17

Their complaints allege a Penn Central violation,

So if this is just a substantially advances

18

claim, it raises the question, number one, whether in the

19

context of legislation, there is a substantially advances

20

prong in the Fifth Amendment, a question that you're --

21

you're asked -- that you are presumably addressing in

22

Lingle v. Chevron.

23

question posed by this Court's decision in Yee whether

24

that is a claim for compensation.

So there are a lot of this -- the Conference of

12

State Chief Justices have filed an amicus brief in support

13

actually of us in this case, saying we don't see that the

14

facts of this case present the question on which you

15

granted review.

16

because the petitioners did challenge this ordinance not

17

only on its face, but as applied.

18

district court below found that it wasn't a real as-

19

applied challenge because they couldn't in any meaningful

20

way distinguish themselves from the other 500 residential

21

hotels in San Francisco, all of whom are concededly

22

subject to the hotel conversion ordinance.

23

suppose in theory, there is some claim for compensation

24

for the temporary period in which they were subject to the

25

hotel conversion ordinance.

I think it's fairer to say it's not clear
