CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Limited.

Mr. Verrilli.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Copyright infringement is the only commercially

12

significant use of the Grokster and StreamCast services,

13

and that is no accident.

14

to capture a clientele of known infringers to stock their

15

services with infringing content, they intentionally and

16

directly promote the infringing use of the service, they

17

support infringing use of the service, and they directly

18

--

19

Respondents deliberately set out

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I just interrupt for the

20

one -- you said "the only significant use."

21

footnote in the red brief that says the figure is some 2.6

22

billion legitimate uses.

23

MR. VERRILLI:

24

JUSTICE STEVENS:

25

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes.

There's a

Yes, Your Honor.

I -

Is that correct, or incorrect?

Well, I think it's an absolutely

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

incorrect assertion of reality, and perhaps I could delve

2

into it and explain why.

3

The evidence in this case, which was presented

4

at summary judgment, showed that 90 percent of the

5

material on the services was either definitely or very

6

likely to be infringing.

7
8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Now, was there a finding of 90

percent?

9

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, this was submitted on

10

summary judgment, Your Honor, and we lost summary

11

judgment, so the evidence has got to be construed in the

12

light most favorable to us.

13

the case on the assumption, we'd submit, of 90 percent.

14

And the Ninth Circuit decided

But with respect to that 10 percent, what

15

happened, and we submit is completely wrong, is that the

16

Ninth Circuit drew the inference, because it wasn't shown

17

by our expert study, which, by the way, is the only

18

empirical analysis in the case, to be infringing, that the

19

Court could assume that it was noninfringing and then

20

extrapolate from that to a number along the lines of the

21

number that Your Honor suggested.

22

completely illegitimate analysis, factually, and, besides,

23

that number is big only because the overall activity is so

24

big.

25

there are that many noninfringing uses -

And I think that that's

The scale of the whole thing is mind-boggling.

If

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. VERRILLI:

3

JUSTICE STEVENS:

4
5

It goes to the -

-- imagine how many infringing -- accuracy of your statement

that there is no other significant legitimate use.
MR. VERRILLI:

I don't think there -- I think

6

it's quite accurate on the summary-judgment record, and

7

certainly drawing the inferences in our favor, as we must

8

here on summary -- on this summary-judgment record, that

9

there is commercially significant noninfringing use.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there could be.

There

11

could be, both with respect to material in the public

12

domain and with respect to people who authorize the

13

transmission.

14

MR. VERRILLI:

I don't think, in the context of

15

this record in this case and the business model of these

16

Defendants, Grokster and StreamCast, that that is true,

17

Justice Ginsburg.

18

what Grokster and StreamCast are arguing is that this

19

Court's decision in Sony stands for the proposition that

20

their massive actual infringement is -- gets a free pass,

21

a perpetual free pass, so long as they can speculate that

22

there are noninfringing uses out there, such as public-

23

domain uses and authorized uses.

24

-- that Sony stands for any such proposition.

25

I don't think that's right.

I think

We don't think that that

We also want to point out that that doesn't help

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

them -- that proposition doesn't help them with respect to

2

one very significant part of this case, and that's the

3

fact that they intentionally built a network of infringing

4

users, and they actively encouraged and assisted

5

infringement.

6

Now, even if there are commercially significant

7

noninfringing uses, and we submit there most definitely

8

aren't under Sony, but even if there are, that's no

9

defense to a contributory infringement claim based on

10

intentional building up of an infringing business and

11

active encouragement and assistance of infringement, and

12

it can't be; because, otherwise, then the fact that they

13

had commercially significant noninfringing uses, again,

14

would be just a free pass to actively promote infringing

15

uses; not merely to support them, but to promote them.

16

And so -

17

JUSTICE SOUTER:

BUt, your argument, I take it,

18

would be the same if the proportions were reversed.

19

argument with respect to -- your current argument with

20

respect to infringing use would be the same if only 10

21

percent -- if it were assumed that only 10 percent of the

22

use were illegitimate and infringing.

23
24
25

MR. VERRILLI:

Your

Is that correct?

The active-encouragement aspect

of our argument would be the same, certainly.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

That's right.

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

MR. VERRILLI:

I think there's -- as that term -

-- there's a lot of --- is used?

Yes, Justice O'Connor, there's a

10

lot of lingo floating around in this case -- inducement,

11

active encouragement, assistance.

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

If we should think that the

13

Respondents are not liable for the type of contributory

14

infringement dealt with in Sony, could this Court reach

15

the question of active inducement on this record?

16

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, very definitely.

I think -

17

I think the Court, of course, should find that there's

18

contributory liability under the Sony theory -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not clear -- it's not

10

clear to me from your brief, focusing on the contributory

11

aspect of it, not -- and not the inducement part of it -

12

it's not clear to me from your brief what your test is.

13

What do we tell the trier of fact, that if there is a

14

substantial part of the use which is noninfringement, if

15

there's any part?

16
17

MR. VERRILLI:

Here's what I -- here's where I

think the test -

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. VERRILLI:

Leaving aside the inducement.

Right.

Here's what I -- here's

20

what we think the test is on the -- what we'll call the

21

Sony aspect of the case, that it's -- the question here is

22

-- Sony poses to us -- is really a touchstone kind of

23

question, not a numerical kind of question.

24

under Sony is whether this is a business that is

25

substantially unrelated to infringement.

The question

In other words,

1

are they building their business on supporting legitimate

2

activity, or, instead, are they building their business

3

supporting infringing activity?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

to the birds on the trier of fact in every case -

6

MR. VERRILLI:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

MR. VERRILLI:

9

Well, then we just throw this

That's the touchstone.

No, I think Well, how do we know -

And that's where you start.
Now, the numbers, the relative

10

proportions of use, are relevant.

11

itself, certainly, where the majority use was

12

noninfringing, that's a legitimate business; you don't

13

need to go further.

14

taking the record at summary judgeent in our favor, as it

15

must be, and the Ninth Circuit's assumption that you've

16

got 90 percent infringing use, billions and billions of

17

acts of infringing use, and minuscule actual noninfringing

18

use, it seems to us it's just -

19

In a case like Sony

In a case like this one, where,

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're not saying -- now you're

20

using different tests.

21

right, on your test, are we sure, if you were the counsel

22

to Mr. Carlson, that you recommend going ahead with the

Xerox machine?

the creator of the VCR, that you could recommend, given

25

the use, copying movies, that we should ever have a VCR?

that he could go ahead and have an iPod, or, for that

matter, Gutenberg, the press?

problem.

MR. VERRILLI:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. VERRILLI:

I mean, you see the

Yes, I think my answer to What's the answer?
-- those questions are: yes, yes,

yes, and yes.

9

[Laughter.]

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because in each case -- for all

11

I know, the monks had a fit when Gutenberg made his press

12

--

13

[Laughter.]

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- but the problem, of course,

15

is that it could well be, in each of those instances, that

16

there will be vast numbers of infringing uses that are

17

foreseeable.

18

MR. VERRILLI:

I disagree with that, Your Honor.

19

Certainly not -- I don't think there's any empirical

20

evidence to suggest, with respect to any of the things

21

that Your Honor just identified -- and let me pick out the

guess.

obvious that there were very significant lawful commercial

uses for it.

MR. VERRILLI:

Honor, and here's why.

commercially significant noninfringing uses that

demonstrates contributory infringement.

to demonstrate that you're making a material contribution,

with knowledge that you're doing so.

9

they have absolute certainty?

10

To -- it's not just the absence of

The inventor, at the

They're not making a

No, they don't have

absolute certainty.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I don't quite understand

12

the -- I take it, inventors are profit-motive-driven, and

13

if they know that something they're working on is going to

14

have copyright experience, you -- have got copyright

15

problems, you can't just say, "Oh, well, the inventor's

16

going to invent anyway."

17

MR. VERRILLI:

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I -- but the problem Or did I misunderstand your -

No, I -- I think that you have -

20

to show contribution, you should have -- you have to be

21

making a material contribution, with knowledge that you're

22

doing so.

23

And so JUSTICE SCALIA:

But the inventor of Xerox does

24

that.

25

he knows a lot of people are going to use it to Xerox

showing -- I don't think there could be anywhere close to

5

a showing that you've got the vast majority of use from -

for infringement from the time that the device comes out.

7

I just don't think that's -

I don't think there's anywhere close to a

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. VERRILLI:

10

Well, let's go -- realistic.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

-- let's go from Xerox back to

11

your iPod.

12

understand what people are doing out there, but it's

13

certainly not clear to me.

14

go out and buy a CD and put it on my iPod, but I also know

15

perfectly well that if I can get the music on the iPod

16

without buying the CD, that's what I'm going to do.

17

think it's reasonable to suppose that everybody else would

18

guess that.

19

Damoclean sword?

20

How is that clear in the iPod case?

I may not

I know perfectly well I could

And I

So why, in the iPod, do you not have this

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, because I don't actually

21

think that there is evidence that you've got overwhelming

22

infringing use.

23

not a -

24
25

I just think that's -- it's not a -- it's

JUSTICE SOUTER:

whether to invent the iPod or not.

MR. VERRILLI:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

4

MR. VERRILLI:

I mean, that's -

I think when you get to the -- the concern.
-- I think when you have vast-

majority infringing use, they should be on the hook.

I don't think -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. VERRILLI:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Now,

Okay, but you're -- you have that problem No, but you're -

10

MR. VERRILLI:

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

12

you're not answering the question.

13

do we know in advance, on your test, anything that would

give the inventor, or, more exactly, the developer, the

15

confidence to go ahead?

16

knows he's going to be sued immediately.

17

product performance out there, as there is in this case.

18

So, on your substantiality theory, why isn't it a foregone

19

conclusion in the iPod that the iPod loser -- or developer

20

is going to lose his shirt?

Yes, that's inducement.
No, I don't think it is an

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

3

The decision below allows companies, like

4

Respondents, to build a business model out of copyright

5

infringement without fear of secondary liability.

6

as they avoid obtaining actual knowledge that a particular

7

customer is about to infringe a particular copyright, they

8

are free to operate a system that involves massive

9

copyright infringement with full knowledge that the draw

10

of the entire system for customers and advertisers alike

11

is the unlawful copying.

12

system -

13

No matter much how much of that

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, what do you think Sony

14

allowed?

15

substantial noninfringing use, it's okay?

16

As long

It talked about -- if it's, what, capable of

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, Justice O'Connor.

17

And then I think the Court explained and elaborated that

18

the test is whether or not there are commercially

19

significant noninfringing uses.

20

Ninth Circuit did in this case is basically adopt the test

21

of mere theoretical capability for noninfringing use, plus

22

maybe some anecdotal evidence.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I would say what the

And what -- and your test is

whether there's a substantial use that's lawful?

19
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

to articulate it is that if the way that the business

2

model of the particular Defendant is set up is that they

3

are not involved in a business substantially unrelated

4

from copyright infringement, that there should be

5

liability in that situation.

6

case like this, where over 90 percent of the business -

7

and I think Mr. Verrilli correctly describes that it's not

8

a minimum of 90 percent; it's over 90 percent -- because

9

the only evidence on the other side is anecdotal evidence

10

And I think in an extreme

that there are such things as public-domain works.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Clement, where did

12

the 90 percent figure come from?

it because it's summary judgment, but where did it come

14

from?

MR. CLEMENT:

I know we have to accept

It came from a study by

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm not sure about that, but Well, I thought -- I mean, you

apart, and others support it, but we also have briefs from

7

the ACLU saying you could put whole libraries within this

system.

MR. CLEMENT:

Well -

JUSTICE BREYER:

The question I wanted to ask

11

you is, given that concern, that there are, conceptually

12

anyway, really excellent uses of this thing, does

13

deliberate -- what is the word?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Actual inducement?
Yes.

Because what you are

16

worried about, it seemed to me that the actual inducement

17

would take care of.

18

"Let's have a trial on actual inducement."

19

is the extreme case you're talking about, why wouldn't the

20

Petitioners here be bound to win that trial?

21

And if you sent it back and said,

MR. CLEMENT:

If this really

Well, based on our review of the

22

record -- and we haven't been able to see the entire

23

record -- I agree with you, the Petitioners ought to be

24

able to win this case on an active-inducement ground, and

25

that's a narrow way to decide the case.

I do think,

21
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

though, this Court might have to say something about the

2

Sony issue before it reached that issue.

3

feel compelled to do that, I think it would be a mistake

4

to sanction the Ninth Circuit's reading of Sony, because,

5

you're right, there's a theoretical possibility that

6

public-domain works can be exchanged on this system, but

7

it's also true that this system doesn't have much of a

8

comparative advantage for trading in public-domain works.

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And if it did

Well, you got interrupted a

10

bit.

think Sony stands for and how the Ninth got it wrong, if

12

you believe it.

13

Tell us, in the simplest way you can, what test you

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice O'Connor, it stands for -

14

the test is whether or not there are commercially

15

significant noninfringing uses.

16

wrong because it thought that test was satisfied by a

17

combination of two things: being able to point out that

18

there were such things as public-domain works or

19

authorized sharing of the Wilco album, for example, and

20

anecdotal evidence that you could actually do that.

The Ninth Circuit got it

21

Now, if that were the right reading of Sony,

22

with respect, I would suggest that footnote 23 of this

23

Court's Sony decision would have been the sum total of the

24

Court's analysis, because in that footnote the Court

25

observed that there were broadcasts of public-domain

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the owner of the

instrumentality, the program, thinks that there's going to

going to be some abuse at the -- in the short term, but he

suggest, if you're at a 50-50 -- I mean, if you're

anywhere below 50 percent, we think that there should be

21

no liability under the Sony standard.

22

that level and there's sufficient evidence that you're

23

really targeting infringing uses, then I think maybe there

24

would be liability.

25

there would clearly not be liability in that situation.

What we would like to suggest, though, is there

between your position and Mr. Verrilli, I take it, is that

Petitioners, but a trial.

MR. CLEMENT:

Which is why you need -

-- Justice Scalia -- the Sony -

-- and that's why I think it's

14

important to preserve a role for the Sony test.

15

again, this Court, in Sony, could have adopted a simple

16

theoretical-capability test, but this Court, instead,

17

adopted a test that required there to be shown some

18

commercially significant use for the -- noninfringing use.

19

And even in the patent context, where I think the test is,

20

and should be, more demanding, even in that context, cases

21

like Fromberg, which we cite at page 19 of our brief, show

22

that there is an analysis to make sure that the suggested

23

theoretical noninfringing use is, in fact, a practical use

24

of the item.

concerns about that, as well.

give them ten years of, sort of, free space to do as -

10

facilitate as much copyright infringement as possible.

11

think what we would say is that when you're -- when a suit

12

targets a nascent technology at the very beginning, there

13

ought to be a lot of leeway, not just for observed

14

noninfringing uses, but for the capacity of noninfringing

15

uses.

I don't know that we would

I don't think, in fairness, that's what you have

it's not some newfangled idea.

here is that if you give something of value away for free

consumers to your site, and you're likely to attract

advertisers.

that we want to further through a development of secondary

JUSTICE SOUTER:

MR. TARANTO:

We think it is critical that the Court adhere,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That, Mr. Taranto, is

7

something I find very puzzling.

8

one could take it as clear -- "capable of substantial

9

noninfringing use."

There is a statement -

That would be very clear, I agree.

10

But Sony goes on for 13 more pages.

11

all that clear, it would have stopped there.

12

when you're interpreting a document, one rule is, you read

13

on, and if you read on, you find we need not give precise

14

content to the question of how much use is commercially

15

significant.

16

you then read back, as a careful reader would, then you

17

find this statement that the primary use of the Sony

18

machine for most owners was time-shifting, a use that the

19

Court found either authorized or fair, and, hence,

20

noninfringing.

If the standard were

That doesn't sound very clear to me.

So I don't think you can take from what is a

22

rather long opinion, and isolate one sentence, and say,

"Aha, we have a clear rule."

MR. TARANTO:

Well, that sentence, Justice

Ginsburg, is expressly stated to be the rule of law that

to say, there are two things that satisfy the test.

3

primary thing, of course, is what takes up most of those

13 pages, the question whether in-home time-shifting is

fair use, a question that was of considerable interest to

6

tens of millions of individuals throughout the United

States.

MR. TARANTO:

This Court is

Well, I will -- let me urge that

there is, in fact, considerable weight to stare decisis,

JUSTICE BREYER:

What is -- what is the answer

to Justice Kennedy's question?

the last 21 years, industry throughout America has taken

the standard as being approximately whether it is capable

noninfringing uses.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- and the country seems to

have survived that standard.

because it's what it is.

Why should that be the right test, instead of some other

test, like substantial use, et cetera?

And the reason -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why isn't this a classic

willful-ignorance case?

MR. TARANTO:

Because willful ignorance is about

having possession of information and refusing to look at

6

it.

7

autonomous communication is one in which there is no

8

mother-may-I system, no chaperone, no information provided

9

to us at the time that there is any request.

This -- that does not occur here.

This tool of

When I ask

10

for a file from you, there is no information that goes

11

back to StreamCast or to Grokster -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, but I thought willful

13

ignorance was basically a certainty of what was going on

14

without empirically verifying it, so as to, sort of,

15

maintain the guise of one's hands over one's eyes.

16

seems to me, if that's what it is, that's what we've got.

17

MR. TARANTO:

And it

No, I don't think so, I think, on

willful ignorance has bite is when you do have the

information right in front of you, and you refuse to look

at it.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. TARANTO:

statement at the end of their summary-judgment pleading

19

back to that, I wanted to be clear on what you were saying

21

MR. TARANTO:

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
Because, as I read your

was not talked about in these terms.

There are literally a handful -- on page 7 and 8 of their

MR. TARANTO:

17

would, of course, have had to make the very implausible

assertion, in a business in which there is no plausible

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. VERRILLI:

18

I'd like to start by clarifying the inducement

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

issue, and then explain why inducement is not enough, and

20

then have a word, if I might, about the reality of this

21

case.

22

The reason, Justice Souter, you find it bizarre

23

is because a shell game is going on here.

24

Respondent's position -- excuse me -- the Respondent's

25

position here is that we can sue for specific

What the

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

infringements that we can show were induced by these

2

specific acts, such as e-mail support.

3

inducement is that we are entitled to injunctive relief

4

against the continued operation of this gigantic

5

infringement machine, which was built by the inducement.

6

Our position on

Now, I think that the Respondents have quite

7

clearly said that they're -- they don't think any

8

injunctive relief is available, going forward.

9

entitled, under Section 502 of the Copyright Act, to

But we're

10

effective relief, not merely a -- relief, judgment

11

relief, that says, "Go and sin no more," but relief that

12

undoes the consequences of this inducement, of this

13

massive effort to build a gigantic engine of infringement.

14

And that is why they're just wrong about that.

15

And you certainly can't affirm the Ninth Circuit

16

and allow us to go forward with anything like that theory,

17

because the Ninth Circuit said the only thing we can sue

18

for -- the only thing we can sue for -- is a situation in

19

which we can show that we had knowledge of specific acts

20

of infringement at a time when we could stop those

21

specific acts of infringement.

22

affirm and let that go forward.

23

So there's just no way to

Now, why is infringement -- why is inducement

24

not enough?

suggested, these companies already operate in the shadows,

It's not enough because, as Justice Scalia

and a ruling here, which would be, I submit, a significant

2

cutback of the Sony rule, that inducement is the only

3

available ground of liability, would just leave them to

paper over -- you know, we do have some paper evidence

here, a paper trail here, but that'll just -- they just

And I submit that Sony was quite clear on this.
Sony said that the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,

10

not copyright law, generally, and not secondary liability,

11

generally, but the staple article-of-commerce doctrine,

12

the noninducement part of the analysis, has got to strike

13

an effective balance -- a real balance that provides

14

effective protection of copyright, as well as protecting

15

unrelated lines of commerce.

16

Now, their rule is a rule of immunity.

It's a

free pass.

23

that's supposed to be the effective protection part of the

balance that Sony said this law is supposed to strike.
