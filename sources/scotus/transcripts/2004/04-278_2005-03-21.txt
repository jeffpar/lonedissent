CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear

argument on number 04-278, the Town of Castle Rock

versus Jessica Gonzales.

Mr. Eastman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. EASTMAN

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7
8

MR. EASTMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

9

What happened here is undeniably tragic.

10

A father shot and killed his own daughters.

11

under a restraining order, so the issue for this

12

Court is whether the order restraining Mr. Gonzales

13

also gave to Mrs. Gonzales and her children a

14

property interest put against the police giving

15

Mrs. Gonzales an entitlement to the arrest of her

16

estranged husband.

17

He was

More precisely, the issue is whether the

18

State of Colorado intended to create such a property

19

interest.

20

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Tell us how we know

21

exactly how much discretion the State of Colorado

22

wanted to give to the police.

23

MR. EASTMAN:

24

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

25

uses the word shall enforce.

Well, Justice O'Connor -Without a statute that
Do we know how Colorado

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

1

has interpreted that?

2

MR. EASTMAN:

Well, they have in other

3

cases, as we note in our brief, that the word shall

4

is not always mandatory, particularly here, I think,

5

Justice O'Connor, when we have such a backdrop of law

6

enforcement discretion.

7

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, are there

8

Colorado cases that tell us how we should read those

9

statutes?

10

MR. EASTMAN:

Not in particular on this

11

statute.

12

word shall says that you have to read it in context

13

of the entire statute.

14

used several different places pointing several

15

different directions in the statute.

16

They only -- the Colorado case law on the

And here the word shall is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So do you concede that if

17

shall means shall, that it creates a property

18

interest?

MR. EASTMAN:

No, Justice Scalia, I do

not.

don't --

2

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Eastman, would you

3

comment on the extent of deference that we should

4

give to the court of appeals' interpretation of

5

Colorado while in view of what we said in Bishop

6

against Wood?

7

MR. EASTMAN:

Yes, I don't think here,

8

because it's not just an application of Colorado law

9

here.

We have identical statutes in 19 or 20

10

different states around the country.

11

do --

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And what you

But the Colorado statute

13

is the one that's controlling in this case and

14

normally, at least according to Bishop against Wood,

15

we defer to the interpretation of the court of

16

appeals as the issue of state law.

17

MR. EASTMAN:

Well, what you're asking is

18

that the court of appeals that created -- that read

19

this statute shall, without any Colorado court

20

interpretation, and did so without any greater

21

indication from the Colorado legislature, that it

22

intended more than just to give direction to police.

23

It intended to create a property interest.

24
25

I understand the question from Bishop
versus Wood, but I don't think we can defer to the

Tenth Circuit here in creating something that

2

Colorado did not intend to create.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

issue, whether Colorado intended to create it.

5
6

Of course, that's the

MR. EASTMAN:
difference.

7

But I think there is a big

I mean -JUSTICE STEVENS:

The reading in Bishop

8

against Wood was really counterintuitive also, as the

9

dissenters pointed out, as you would agree, I think.

10

MR. EASTMAN:

Yes, and I think when you're

11

looking at a statute such as this, that is invoking

12

the federal court's -- I mean, what we're using is a

13

state law to invoke federal protections.

14

it's that deference to the State that I think is more

15

critical.

16

federal courts to make that decision when Colorado

17

itself has not been -- has been as ambiguous as it

18

is.

And I think

And I don't think you can allow the

I think we need a clearer statement.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did you suggest to the

20

federal court that it certify the question of the

21

meaning of Colorado law to this Colorado Supreme

22

Court?

23

MR. EASTMAN:

No, we did not, because I

24

don't think the statute gets us over the hurdle to

25

make that even necessary.

There is nothing in this

6
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

statute that is intended -- that uses the language of

2

property interest or entitlement.

3

Court would look to its decision in Gonzaga, for

4

example, in alaogous context --

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think if this

Wait, wait.

I thought we

6

were just talking here about state law as to whether

7

shall means shall.

8

of state law whether, if it does mean shall, it

9

creates a property interest for purposes of the

10

Do you think that it's a matter

Federal Constitution?

11

MR. EASTMAN:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. EASTMAN:

No.

And what we're talking

about --

16
17

You don't concede that

that's a state question at all?

14
15

No, Justice Scalia, I don't.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Well, isn't that what we

squarely held in Bishop?

18

MR. EASTMAN:

Well, what we have to look

19

at is whether, first, the State, under Roth, intended

20

to create a property interest rather than just giving

21

mandatory direction to its officers.

22

critical question there is what the default rule

23

ought to be on a statute that is not clear on that

24

question.

25

And I think the

And I think Roth tells us that for

7
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

purposes of federal constitutional law, the default

2

cannot be that we assume the State created a property

3

interest, at least in this kind of nontraditional

4

property interest.

5

focus on what kind of property interest we're talking

6

about.

7

And I think it's important to

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose shall does mean

8

shall.

9

the fire department shall respond to fires, the

Fine.

But you might have a statute that says

10

police department shall respond to crimes, the Army

11

shall respond to attacks.

12

Even the word shall doesn't necessarily

13

mean that this is the kind of interest that, like

14

property, the Duke of Rutland relied upon Blackacre,

15

that welfare recipients rely upon continuing to

16

receive money.

17
18
19

What is it about this that makes it like
property, even if shall does mean shall?
MR. EASTMAN:

Justice Breyer, I agree, and

20

the difference between even mandatory language

21

directing law enforcement to behave in a certain way

22

is a far cry from actually creating a property

23

interest in Mrs. Gonzales herself.

24
25

This Court in Sandin held that in the
prison context, and I think the analogy in this

is a good one.

We would want to see an
None of that is

And I think that --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you compare it

10

to -- this is a court order and it's enforceable.

11

There is no question about that, is there?

12

court order that enforcement officials carry out.

13

How does it differ from, say, a money judgment and

14

executing -- levying execution on property?

15

creditor says, here is my judgment, marshal, sheriff,

16

go out and find some of the defendant's property.

17

MR. EASTMAN:

This is a

Judgment

Well, Justice Ginsburg, you

18

know, the analogy we cite in our reply brief and the

19

U.S. Marshal Statute, 42 U.S.C. 1990 that says that

20

there is a right in the beneficiary to have a warrant

21

issued.

22

he can be challenged and held to a thousand dollar

23

fine for the benefit of the person whose arrest

24

warrant he was supposed to serve.

25

And if the marshal refuses to do that, that

Now, even that doesn't quite go far enough

9
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

because there is not a private right of action by the

beneficiary about a warrant to bring the suit

directly.

and Ms. Gonzales could go back in and get a contempt

But at least that kind of statute is

MR. EASTMAN:

To my knowledge, we've never

17

held that the police have an actionable obligation to

18

enforce them.

19

But the State --

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But wouldn't you concede

20

that in the case of the injunction in which there is

21

a specific order in relation to a specific

22

respondent, that the police have much less discretion

23

than they would have when there is in effect a

24

general statute saying, respond in these kinds of

25

situations?

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In the case of the

5

statute that we're talking with, but they don't have

that kind of discretion, do they, in Justice

Ginsburg's example?

8

you're going to take the example that Justice

9

Ginsburg has given you as equivalent to the example

What I'm getting at is, if

that we have before us, I think you're fighting

11

uphill and I don't think you have to do that.

14

terms of the restraining order cut out all discretion

15

whatsoever and that they specifically are written in

16

terms that the property interest creates an entitlement

in the beneficiary of the restraining order, as

18

against not just the person restrained or the person

19

whose property is going to be attached, but an

20

entitlement to enforcement by the police itself, then

21

I think we would be on the step toward creating a

does discretion on the means to use include

MR. EASTMAN:

determinations made here?
MR. EASTMAN:

Well, we don't know.

We

don't know because this case comes up here on a

motion to dismiss.

14

The allegations are that they didn't enforce the

whether it's because they made a determination of no

So are you requesting

20

that there are insufficient fact findings here, so it

should be returned --

22

MR. EASTMAN:

No, Justice Ginsburg,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Mr. Eastman, can I ask

4

you this question?

through the Colorado State system instead of through

the federal system, and the Colorado Supreme Court

7

had written precisely the same opinion that the Tenth

8

Circuit ruled.

overturn their holding that there was a property

Supposing this case came to us

Would we have jurisdiction to

interest here?

11

MR. EASTMAN:

Justice Stevens, you're

12

asking whether, for purposes of federal

13

constitutional law, the state court decision that

14

Colorado had created a property interest is

15

dispositive.

16
17

And I'm not sure it is, but --

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then your answer is no,

we would not have jurisdiction in that event.

18

MR. EASTMAN:

Well, no, I was saying that

19

yes, you would, because what we're talking about is

20

looking to the state legislature on whether they've

21

created a property interest for purposes of federal

22

law.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We could say that they

24

had misconstrued Colorado law?

25

really mean that.

I don't think you

MR. EASTMAN:

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But I think you might --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Perhaps what you mean is

Okay.

4

that what is a property interest for purposes of

5

Colorado law, if Colorado chooses to nominate some

6

utterly zany thing of property interest, it doesn't

7

necessarily mean that it's a property interest for

8

purposes of the Federal Constitution.

9
10

MR. EASTMAN:

Justice Scalia, I'm happy to

do that.

11

JUSTICE STEVENS:

12

won't find any cases making that point.

MR. EASTMAN:

22

No, but it makes perfect

sense.

No, you won't, but it makes

perfect sense --

15
16

You can do that, but you

But you have cases

That's the problem.

MR. EASTMAN:

What we want to find out is

whether the Colorado --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do we have any cases

I don't think we have any.

4

contrary.

5

that there is no right to arrest or enforcement

6

against somebody else.

7

All we have are cases to the

Linda R.S., for example, this Court held

And so I think at least in the context of

8

these very non-zany property interest claims, that we

9

need to have a pretty clear statement, not even from

10

the Colorado courts, but from the legislature itself

11

that the legislature intended, as a matter of state

12

policy, to have a property interest created and all

13

of the consequences that would flow from that.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I stop you?

You

15

cited that Linda R.S., whatever, I thought that was a

16

standing case saying it's not going to do you any

17

good to have him locked up in jail if what you want

18

to do is get money from him.

19

MR. EASTMAN:

It was, but the case has

20

been relied on by several subsequent decisions

21

including in the Second Circuit in the Attica case,

22

inmates of Attica, for the proposition that there is

23

just simply no right to an enforcement against

24

somebody else, that there is no entitlement.

25

Now, I'm not saying that the Colorado

15
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

legislature never could create such an entitlement,

2

but given the backdrop of Linda R.S., and also given

3

the backdrop of traditional law enforcement

4

discretion, I think we need a much clearer statement

5

from the Colorado legislature itself, both that it's

6

written in terms of the beneficiary -- getting her an

7

entitlement against the police, rather than in terms

8

of what the person restrained is.

9

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Eastman, assuming

10

for the moment there is no due -- procedural due

11

process right here, on the facts of this case, does

12

Colorado law provide any alternative remedy for

13

Mrs. Gonzales?

14
15

MR. EASTMAN:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, it

does.

16

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

17

MR. EASTMAN:

And what would that be?

There are several remedies.

18

In the first instance, any violation of a restraining

19

order, she can petition the court for a contempt

20

order, even against the police.

21

willful and wanton, they can be held --

22

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

If their conduct was

So she could presumably

23

ask for some relief under that notion, against the

24

police and possibly the town?

MR. EASTMAN:

Against the police and --

not the town.

2

against the police under the tort statute, the police

3

are not immune if their conduct is willful and

4

wanton.

5

The town has absolute immunity but

And I think this Court in DeShaney

addressed that very question when it looked like if

7

the State wanted to create an interest here, that it

could do so by modifying the --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

You say the

10

tort statute means something like the Federal Tort

11

Claims Act.

12

Does Colorado have something like that?
MR. EASTMAN:

It does.

And there is a

Colorado Governmental Immunity Act that gives

14

immunity to police except when their conduct is

15

willful and wanton.

16

exist and if the Colorado legislature wanted to lower

17

the threshold on that and make it negligent omissions

18

or what have you, whatever the allegations are, they

19

could do so.

20

And so that tort remedy does

The fact that they haven't done so I think

21

is a pretty strong indication that they did not

22

intend to create a property interest here.

23

If there is a property interest -- let me

just say one minute about the procedures that were

given, and then I'll reserve the remainder of my

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What good is -- what

does the restraining order do, then, other than give

her a right to sue the person who is restrained for

contempt?

MR. ELWOOD:

I think it does two main

20

things.

21

her husband which are enforceable through contempt

22

and are enforceable by asking the police to enforce

23

them.

25

First of all, it gives her rights against

has the effect basically of creating a new arrest

police and the police are not obliged to respond.
MR. ELWOOD:

That is correct.

She has the

ability to ask the police to enforce the order, but

10

the police have discretion, under our reading of the

11

statute, not to enforce the --

12
13
14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do the police have any

duty at all, in your view?
MR. ELWOOD:

The police -- I don't believe

15

that the police have any sort of actionable duty.

16

think that what the statute creates is basically it's

17

a direction from the legislature that this is what

18

they want them to do.

19
20
21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I

Could the police just

issue an order saying ignore all orders of this kind?
MR. ELWOOD:

I think that if they were to

22

do that, I do not think that there would be sort of

23

any individual right to challenge that.

24

they would be adopting a policy decision that would be

25

probably different than the one the Colorado

I think that

legislature has --

2

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

That's the sort

3

of aggressive sort of thing that the Colorado courts

4

could conclusively decide.

5

MR. ELWOOD:

That's something the Colorado

6

courts decide, and it's something that would be --

7

that could be addressed through the political process

8

as well.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there any extreme

10

cases we could imagine where the police have a duty

11

to protect the citizen?

12

people beating up on the victim, no race involved,

13

and he just enjoys watching the fight.

14

a duty under the Constitution to intervene?

15

MR. ELWOOD:

The policeman sees four

Does he have

I think any duty that there

16

would be would be a substantive duty.

17

indicated in DeShaney that it would require basically

18

state creation of the harm or state increasing the

19

vulnerability of the person.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this Court

So for example -Did DeShaney stand for

21

the proposition there could never be an affirmative

22

duty to intervene, under what you're talking about

23

the Constitution here?

24

MR. ELWOOD:

25

I think it would be, in a

case, for example, where a prisoner was handcuffed in

21
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

his cell with a cell mate who the authorities knew to

2

be basically interested in harming him.

3

had affirmatively restrained him, I think that that

4

would be a case where the State had created the

5

danger or increased the vulnerability.

Because they

6

So I think there is something left to the

7

requirement of police protection substantively under

8

DeShaney.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But there has to be some

10

State -- the State has to have created the risk

11

somehow?

12

MR. ELWOOD:

Under DeShaney, the State has

13

to have created the risk or increased the

14

vulnerability of the person.

15

Now, in addition to the fact that the

16

Colorado statute does not speak to the Plaintiff, it

17

essentially speaks to the restrained party.

18

under -- as Mr. Eastman mentioned, under Gonzaga and

19

this Court's 1983 cases, that when a statute speaks

20

in terms of the regulated party instead of the

21

protected party, there is no implication of an intent

22

to create a federal right.

23

And

And I think that that principle would

24

apply even more clearly in the context of the state

25

rights, because there there is a question of imposing

22
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

federal liability which shouldn't really be done in

2

the absence of an indication that the State really

3

meant to do that.

4

Another reason is -- not to assume that

5

there is a property right here, is that the State

6

statute does not create any sort of procedural

7

remedies or judicial remedies which this Court has in

8

the past taken as an indication that the State really

9

did mean to create a protected right.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's your response to

11

the fact that the Tenth Circuit found otherwise and

12

that we usually defer?

13

MR. ELWOOD:

I think our response would be

14

that it's not simply -- well, first of all, I don't

15

want to make too much of the fact that it's obviously

16

a very close question of state law because the Tenth

17

Circuit was divided by a single vote.

18

But even aside from that, you basically

19

have to adopt not simply a question of what the state

20

law says, but what the federal courts are going to do

21

with it.

22

tremendous departure it would be, what a procedural

23

innovation it would be to give complaining witnesses

24

essentially a right in the process, that in the

25

absence of a very clear statement, the federal court

And we are of the opinion that given what a

23
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

should not imply a right or imply -- should not

2

infer, rather, that the state legislature intended to

3

create a right.

4

So essentially, what we're asking for is a

5

clear statement rule.

6

statement, we should presume that the --

7

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And in the absence of a clear

Do you agree that if

8

this case stands with the state system, we would have

9

to accept their holding on the property right issue?

10

MR. ELWOOD:

Obviously, I think there

11

would be a much closer question at a minimum.

12

may be something to the fact that we should -- this

13

is the sort of thing we would want a statement from

14

the Colorado legislature.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There

No, let's -- I'm

16

assuming the Supreme Court has said, this is what the

17

statute means and so forth and so on, wouldn't that

18

be binding on this?

19

MR. ELWOOD:

I think it would be binding.

20

I mean, it would still be the federal question of

21

whether that applied federal law correctly.

22

given that it's basically a question of what is a

23

state property right, yes.

24
25

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But

Or whether the question

of property right -- the property right issue is not

24
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

a question of federal law, it is a question of state

2

law.

3

MR. ELWOOD:

That is correct.

4

correct.

5

sort of correct it at the margin --

6

That is

There is something of a federal overlay to

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes. What did they hold

7

in the Tenth Circuit?

8

mandatory. You can have a mandatory duty, but that

9

doesn't mean that the victim has a legal right to

10
11
12

I mean, shall could be

enforce that duty.
MR. ELWOOD:

That's absolutely correct,

Justice Breyer.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

the Tenth Circuit in respect to that?

15

MR. ELWOOD:

So what did they hold in

Basically they said that

16

because it is -- because the statute was mandatory,

17

they basically leapt from that to an inference that

18

because it was mandatory, it was a duty that she

19

could enforce.

20
21
22

But there is no tradition in that --

JUSTICE BREYER:

They should reask the

certified question?
MR. ELWOOD:

I don't think that they need

23

to because that is something that, again, it would be

24

a useful thing given that there are 50 legislatures

25

out there and there are probably at least 20 and

25
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

perhaps 31 similar statutes that rather than certify

2

the question and then have to certify on a

3

State-by-State basis, just to adopt a background rule

4

that this Court applies.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But a background rule is

6

awfully tough.

7

in all kinds of statutes.

8

sanitation department shall inspect your home for

9

tuberculosis, maybe that does give a right.

I mean, you could have lots of shalls
If they said shall, the

If they

10

say to the fire department, you shall put out fires,

11

I wouldn't think they meant that every possible

12

homeowner had a right to a lawyer and a full judicial

13

hearing before they go and respond to an alarm.

14
15
16

You know, I mean, it depends on the area.
I don't know how to create a background rule.
MR. ELWOOD:

Well, I think the rule that

17

the Court could create is that in a criminal context,

18

which is all that is at stake here, there is a

19

background presumption that individuals lack a

20

judicially cognizable right to arrest or prosecution.

21

For example, an arrest warrant, although

22

there is some question about whether or not that

23

really is mandatory.

24

mandatory terms.

25

the marshal, you are hereby commanded to arrest Jane

It's certainly couched in

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Doe or whoever.

2

But there is a very established body of

3

law that even the people who basically agitate for

4

the arrest warrant don't have a grounds to complain

5

if the arrest warrant isn't executed.

6

At the federal level, there is Leek versus

7

Timmerman, where the court held there is no

8

protective interest or there is no cognizable

9

interest in the arrest of another party.

And at the

10

state level, there is a lot of case law indicating

11

that officers are not liable to private citizens for

12

failure to execute arrest warrants.

13

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But is it not true that

14

the Colorado legislature could create such a right if

15

it did it with sufficient specificity?

16

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that that is correct.

17

This Court has not placed really many limits on what

18

kind of rights could be created under Roth.

19

some indication in cases like Sandin that there might

20

be limits at the margins or rather at least limits

21

presumptively --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There is

3

Does that describe everything in the

MR. ELWOOD:

Justice Scalia, all I'm

4

saying is that the Roth cases haven't really

5

indicated that there might be limits on that.

6

think that there are reasons --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

Well, because there has

8

been no case that really did not involve something

9

that could reasonably be called property.

10

MR. ELWOOD:

Correct.

And I think that

11

this is a case where courts might want to exercise

12

some caution because there is a reason why they don't

13

involve private citizens in the prosecution.

14

that is because our system is built around the idea

15

that to -- basically, we want to interpose brakes

16

between the complaining witness and the courts and

17

power of the State, as the Court indicated in Young

18

versus United States ex rel. Vuitton.

19

there, because it was a prosecutor, basically serves

20

as a circuit breaker to prevent people from

21

going straight to the --

I see my time

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. REICHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
A public high school student threatened

14

with suspension receives more process under this

15

Court's holding in Goss versus Lopez than Castle Rock

16

is willing to provide to a holder of a court-issued

17

protective order.

18

Instead of providing Ms. Gonzales with any

19

opportunity to be heard in any meaningful manner,

20

Castle Rock repeatedly ignored Ms. Gonzales's pleas

21

to have her children returned to her and the

22

restraining order enforced.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

you think your client was entitled to?

do every day.

and good faith consideration of her complaint of a

restraining order violation, and a good faith

assessment of probable cause.

We would ask this Court to hold that

simply be made by the person on the desk?
MR. REICHEL:

It can, Your Honor, but it

10

needs to be a probable cause determination that is

11

actually communicated to the holder of the

restraining order, whether it be a favorable or

adverse determination, there needs to be some notice

provided to the holder of a restraining order of what

the police officers intend to do.

it would help future people in the same position.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You are correct.

But the

13

ignoring here, the allegations are in the complaint,

14

15

policy, this pattern and practice of just ignoring

16

these types of complaints.

17

law enforcement amicus brief filed on our behalf

18

points out, the ignoring is a classic example of how

19

police have traditionally responded to these types of

20

complaints.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And the ignoring, as the

I'll grant you that, but

22

as I understand it, what stands between or what would

23

stand between your ignoring complaint and success

would simply be the police's statement of a reason

because, as I take it, I take it that you don't deny

to her.

She got a result.

3

After she had talked with them on the

4

phone, she knew that they weren't going to do

5

anything or that they weren't going to do anything

6

satisfactory.

7

the only thing she didn't get that she would be

8

entitled to would be a statement by them as to why

9

they were not going to do something for her.

10

So as I understand it, on your theory,

Is that

what it boils down to?

11

MR. REICHEL:

No.

What it boils down to,

12

Your Honor, is we're looking for a probable cause

don't think there is probable cause, that would be

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

procedural cases are designed so that the right result

20

can be reached most of the time.

21

But all we ask is whether or not the procedure was

22

adequate.

23

MR. REICHEL:

I understand that.

There was no procedure here,

24

Your Honor, and that's the point of our lawsuit is

25

that the fact that Castle Rock has an official custom

realized the police weren't really going to do

process.

have complained to the police earlier, she could have

continue to wait.

order.

They told her to hold on --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That may be a tort, but

3

it's not necessarily a denial of process if the

4

proper place to seek that process was from the court

5

that issued the restraining order.

6

MR. REICHEL:

But the restraining order

7

has no meaning, Your Honor, unless the police are

8

willing to enforce it.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's right, and the

10

court can make sure that they enforce it upon

11

complaint.

12
13
14

MR. REICHEL:

In this case, it's our

position that the legislature has done so as well.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Let me ask you a question

15

that is suggested by Justice Scalia's question.

16

it goes basically simply to the practical problems

17

that your position seems to entail.

And

18

You answered him by saying that the point

19

at which she realized they were denying her whatever

20

she was entitled to was the point at which the

21

children were dead.

22

when this particular right had been denied?

23

How would a reviewing court know

I take it from your answer to Justice

24

Scalia that there had not been a denial of the right

25

and hence a violation of procedural due process after

36
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the first telephone conversation.

2

your answer that there wasn't one after the second

3

conversation.

4

was no ripening, as it were, of the facts into a

5

denial of what she was entitled to until the 3:00

6

a.m. call, is that correct?

7

I take it from

And I take it the only -- that there

MR. REICHEL:

No, Your Honor, and I

8

apologize if I misstated -- and it gave you that

9

impression.

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, my general question,

11

then, is how does a reviewing court determine when or

12

the point at which there has been a denial?

13

MR. REICHEL:

The initial contact with the

14

police department we're saying has to involve

15

appropriate processes --

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So following the first

17

phone call, they would have to have made an express

18

probable cause determination?

19

MR. REICHEL:

They would have had to have

20

made a probable cause determination in good faith and

21

conveyed and communicated --

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And communicate that to

her.
MR. REICHEL:
which they never did.

Communicated that to her,

Instead they just kept telling

2

never made the probable cause determination and

3

conveyed it to her.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

They

Did they simply

5

have to take her word as to the facts on the probable

6

cause issue?

7

MR. REICHEL:

No, not at all, Your Honor,

8

and I believe that the whole intent of Goss versus

9

Lopez was to allow a high school student to

10

understand the interpretation of the principal's view

11

of the facts, and allow the student the opportunity

12

to clarify or to fill in any missing points in terms

13

of the understanding being --

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true, but Goss

15

versus Lopez, to my knowledge -- you may know more

16

about it.

17

of federal cases which second guess the principal or

18

the teacher, once the teacher or the principal gives

19

a plausible reason for suspending the student.

But to my knowledge, there are not a lot

20

And of course my fear is that that is

21

precisely what would occur here.

23

we're too busy.

24

guess that.

25

All right?

There would be
The reason is

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

what you need, which is an instruction to the police

2

department that when a child is missing, you don't

3

wait.

4

instruction on this procedural route.

But I don't see how you can get that

5

MR. REICHEL:

Your Honor, we're not asking

6

for the Court to instruct the police department they

7

have to drop everything --

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Exactly.

And that seems

to me to be the problem, because you have a case

10

where the problem was the delay and that's apparently

11

a common problem.

12

that you take gets at that problem.

13

MR. REICHEL:

And I don't see how this route

Your Honor, if I could

14

respond, the delay issue is not the crux of the

15

problem.

16

officers here never told Ms. Gonzales that they

17

believed that there was or was not probable cause.

18
19
20
21
22

The crux of the problem is that the police

JUSTICE SOUTER:

What good could that have

done anyone?
MR. REICHEL:

It would have allowed her

the opportunity -JUSTICE SOUTER:

She knew, as it was, that

23

they weren't going to do anything.

24

it have done her to know that, oh, it's nice to know

25

that they've gone through a probable cause

What good would

determination in coming to the conclusion that

2

they're not going to do anything.

3

the social value of that?

4

MR. REICHEL:

I mean, what is

Your Honor, I don't believe

5

the record is such that we've alleged that

6

Ms. Gonzales knew that they weren't going to do

7

anything.

8

relied upon --

9

In fact, it's just the opposite, that she

10

JUSTICE SOUTER:

They said call back in

two hours and whatnot.

11

MR. REICHEL:

12

that, to follow their instructions.

13

And she continued to do

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And each time at the end

14

of the call, she knew that they weren't going to do

15

-- they weren't going to go out and look and they

16

weren't going to enforce the order at that point,

17

didn't she?

18

MR. REICHEL:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

I'm not sure that's correct.
I mean, I can understand

20

you're making an argument -- you have made it, but I

21

can understand you're making an argument that the

22

point of procedure is to force people, in this case

23

the police, to face facts.

24

she has made out probable cause that something is

25

wrong here, if they are forced to face that as a

If they really know that

40
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

result of procedure, they will then do something

2

about it.

3

that case.

It's not as easy to be irresponsible in

4

But the trouble with that argument, it

5

seems to me, although it's sound as far as it goes,

6

is that it's an argument that would apply with

7

respect to every statute in which there is mandatory

8

language to the police to enforce it.

9

And that seems to me to suggest a

10

completely nonadministerable system and one which is

11

totally at odds with the normal accord of police

12

discretion.

13

MR. REICHEL:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

15
16

Your Honor -I mean, how do you get

around that dilemma?
MR. REICHEL:

We believe that the process

17

test that we're articulating here is unique to

18

domestic violence mandatory arrest statutes across

19

the country.

20

were enacted precisely because of this problem, the

21

problem of --

22

The reason being is that these statutes

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then why weren't they

23

enacted with an express provision saying, and by the

24

way, the police have got to go, either through the

25

following procedure or, by the way, this statute

41
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

creates a right on the part of the protected party.

2

In other words, if the response to what I

3

understand the problem to have been, if the response

4

was the response that you think the legislature made,

5

why didn't the legislature say something that would

6

take these statutes out of the run of the mill

7

criminal law statutes in which the police, subject to

8

mandatory language, have an apparent obligation to do

9

something to enforce?

10

MR. REICHEL:

I would respectfully submit,

11

Your Honor, that they have, especially in Colorado.

12

This statute is much more detailed than a run of the

13

mill criminal or civil statute.

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it doesn't say that

15

people like your client have a personal right to

16

enforcement with a damage remedy.

17

MR. REICHEL:

It doesn't, Your Honor, but

18

the fact that there is a court order here in place

19

individualizes the entitlement.

20

personal.

21

It makes it

dirty laundry under the assumption, mistakenly here,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Reichel, how would

12

you describe, briefly, the property that your client

13

has been deprived of?

14

What is the property?

MR. REICHEL:

The property is an

15

entitlement to enforcement of her order.

16

property, Your Honor.

17

That's the

That's how it was --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The entitlement to

18

enforcement of an order is property?

19

case that is -- what's the closest case that you

20

would say has held something to be property that is

21

an entitlement to have an order enforced as opposed

22

to an entitlement to a job, an entitlement to money,

23

an entitlement to what I would consider property?

25

MR. REICHEL:

however, what I would classify as a more quirky

2

property interest, and that was the Logan versus

Simmerman Brush case.

situation where there was a statute that provided a

5

cutoff for when somebody could sue for unemployment

6

benefits or discriminatory allegations in the State

of Illinois.

That case dealt with the

is really a right in this process, to go through this

process and by cutting it off without any opportunity

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but it's, at the end

13

of the day, they were unemployment benefits, right?

14

I mean --

15

MR. REICHEL:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

That's true.
Wouldn't the better

analogy be to assume she made a contract with a

private detective agency to protect her from these

events.

if she had a private contract with a private

detective agency to do exactly what the police were

supposed to do here.

That would be a property right

MR. REICHEL:

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

believed that she had a contract with the State of

2

Colorado, at least a promise by the State of Colorado

that she would obtain some protection.

contract for protection would be a familiar kind of

the order -JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. REICHEL:

There is no contract but

12

there is an order.

13

based upon her allegations and based upon her

14

submissions to the court.

15

And here

There is a court issued order

Your Honors, again, Ms. Gonzales took the

16

risk here of seeking an order of protection and

17

airing her dirty laundry in public, and she did so

18

with the reasonable expectation that the order meant

19

something, that law enforcement would enforce it.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could you be precise

21

about what is the due process?

22

not a hearing that you're seeking.

23

could be listened to and no action taken.

24

precisely is the process to which she is due?

25

MR. REICHEL:

You're saying it's
Not just that she
But what

We believe that there has to

45
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

be an objective, thoughtful, reasoned evaluation of

2

her complaint of a violation.

3

necessarily an evaluation in good faith of probable

4

cause, a determination of whether probable cause

5

exists, and an articulation of that determination --

6

And that involves

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

But you said a

7

moment ago, this could be done by the sergeant on

8

duty at the desk who probably had three other calls

9

waiting.

10

Do you still think that could be done?
MR. REICHEL:

Certainly, Your Honor.

I

11

believe if you take a look at some of the model

12

policies already in place by police departments

13

around the country that are attached to the amicus

14

brief of the law enforcement agencies that filed on

15

our behalf, you'll see some policies whereby the

16

person at the desk taking the information is required

17

to have certain types of questions and provide

18

certain types of responses to those questions.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

20

MR. REICHEL:

But on any timetable?

Yeah, we're not asking for

21

the police department to drop everything.

22

asking that they --

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

We're just

If I understand your

24

position correctly, I know what the allegations are

25

here, but if the evidence should show later on that

46
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in response to one of these telephone calls, the desk

2

sergeant said, send a squad car out and see if you

3

can locate the kids, you would lose?

4
5

MR. REICHEL:

No, Your Honor, that's not

what I'm saying.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Because that would have

7

been a good faith response by somebody to try and

8

find out whether there was probable cause.

9

MR. REICHEL:

There has to be an

10

articulation of the determination of probable cause

11

to the holder of the restraining order to allow her

12

to, for example, clarify facts, to perhaps talk to a

13

superior or perhaps, in this case, go somewhere else

14

for help, go to the court.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But where do you get

16

that?

17

to the language of the statute.

18

the requirement, A, that police inform her and, B,

19

that it give reasons for nonenforcement?

20

not within what the Tenth Circuit said.

21

I know that the Tenth Circuit tried to stick

MR. REICHEL:

But where do you get

Those were

I believe it was wrapped

22

within the concept of a probable cause determination.

23

And they did specifically state that if there was an

24

adverse determination, that notice of that

25

determination has to be conveyed to her.

That was, I

47
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

believe, the fourth prong of our analysis.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

did it say with a statement of reasons?

4
5

MR. REICHEL:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where does that come

from?

8
9

With a statement of reasons,

it did, Your Honor.

6
7

So the notice -- yeah,

MR. REICHEL:

Well, the statement of

reasons, Your Honor, allows again for there to be

10

communication on both sides.

11

statement of reasons turned out to be based upon

12

false information --

13
14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that if the

I know that it would be

a fair process that you're describing.

15

MR. REICHEL:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

A meaningful process.
But is it an essential

17

one, that is, that nothing spells out -- in most of

18

the cases that involve property and a procedural due

19

process right, it's a hearing that the person is

20

seeking.

21

not?

22

the police to enforce.

23

give you a reason.

24
25

Are they entitled to benefit or are they

But here, this is not what you want.

MR. REICHEL:

You want

And if they don't enforce, to

Well, I believe that the

enforcement of the order flows from the probable

48
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

cause determination.

2

triggered by a finding of probable cause of a

3

violation.

4

The obligation to enforce is

So the process we're looking for involves

5

the probable cause determination.

6

that by simply ignoring that process, you're

7

depriving somebody potentially of their property

8

right in enforcement of the order.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's our position

But if the police --

10

let's say, focusing on this case, suppose they had

11

looked at this order and said, wow, it gives him

12

weekends with the girls, it gives him summertime with

13

the girls and, subject to his ex-wife's agreement,

14

dinner time with the girls, this can't be all that

15

urgent because if he would harm the girls then why is

16

the judge allowing him so much sole time with them?

17

So wouldn't -- looking at this particular

18

order, wouldn't there be reasons why the police would

19

say, the judge is allowing the father to spend time

20

with the girls, this can't be that urgent?

21

MR. REICHEL:

There could have been, Your

22

Honor, but again, those reasons were never

23

articulated to my client and any reasons the police

24

officers may have had are not in the record.

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But this is such a new

49
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

sort of a requirement you're seeking us to develop

2

here.

suggest such a requirement when it comes to law

4

enforcement requests by citizens of police.

5

be a major step, wouldn't it?

6
7

MR. REICHEL:

It would

It would be a different kind

of case, Your Honor.

8
9

I just don't know of any past case that would

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.

Are there any

indications that any of the police in this instance

10

will face disciplinary action for their response

11

here?

12
13
14
15
16

MR. REICHEL:
Honor.

I really have no idea, Your

I really have no idea.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Could you still bring a

state tort suit?
MR. REICHEL:

No, Your Honor.

I believe

17

that as was conceded in Petitioner's reply brief,

18

they're really under our governmental immunity laws.

19

They're probably the strictest in the country.

20

really is no viable tort --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

There

Because it is

22

willful and wanton, and you've made out a claim they

23

didn't even give an answer, they didn't do anything,

24

they have a practice of doing nothing.

25

MR. REICHEL:

I believe that centers more

50
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

around the causation and foreseeability issues that

2

are triggered by that type of a claim.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if the State cares

4

so little about enforcing what its officers do under

5

its own laws, isn't that some indication that it did

6

not intend to create the property interest that

7

you're arguing for?

8
9

MR. REICHEL:
believe that at all.

No, Your Honor, I don't

And in fact, again, going back

10

to some of the Court's prior cases and the Roth

11

series of case law, if you look, for example, at

12

Logan versus Simmerman Brush, there was a good deal

13

of discussion about whether there was a tort law

14

remedy and, in fact, there was in that case.

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Do you have any

other cases besides Logan?

17

MR. REICHEL:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

19

MR. REICHEL:

On that issue?
Yes.

Not with that elaborate of a

20

discussion on the issue, although I would submit that

21

the existence of a post-depravation remedy, so to

22

speak here, is irrelevant under, again, Logan, simply

23

because we're left now with the Monell claim.

24

left with the allegations of state action, a custom

25

and policy of a state entity here.

We're

51
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

And the existence of a post-depravation

2

state law tort remedy is irrelevant to the analysis

3

of whether there is a due process violation.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If there had been a

5

question certified to the Colorado Supreme Court, and

6

the Colorado Supreme Court said we weren't intending

7

to create any entitlement here, evidence that we

8

don't even have a tort action that's willful or

9

wanton conduct, no liability at all in the

10

municipality.

11

said, we didn't mean to create any entitlement, then

12

where would you be?

13

So suppose the State Supreme Court has

MR. REICHEL:

We probably wouldn't be

14

here, Your Honor.

15

certified to the Tenth Circuit.

16

have to give deference to the Tenth Circuit's

17

analysis of Colorado law on that issue.

18

That question simply never got
And I believe you do

Your Honors, at issue here is a specific

19

order of protection, a legislative mandate requiring

20

enforcement of a protective order and a pattern and

21

practice of the Castle Rock police department of

22

ignoring and failing to enforce court issued

23

protective orders.

part of Castle Rock of not taking complaints of

restraining order violations seriously.

This case involves allegations of a pattern

This pattern and practice that's -- in and

merely seeks the opportunity to prove at a trial on

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you whether

12

you would favor or disfavor our certifying the

13

question whether there is a property right here to

14

the Colorado Supreme Court?

15

MR. REICHEL:

At this point in time, I

16

suppose I would disfavor it, because I believe that

17

Bishop versus Wood is controlling.

18

respectfully request that this Honorable Court affirm

19

the Tenth Circuit's ruling in this matter.

very much.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN C. EASTMAN

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

MR. EASTMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

about the property interest.

claim of a property interest.

5

appropriate to find that even if you were to accept

6

Justice Stevens' contention of a contract, an ADT

7

type of guarantee of protective services, that looks

8

a lot more like the type of entitlements under Roth

9

that this Court has recognized.

10

I want to go back to Justice Scalia's point
This is such a unique
I think it would be

I think it may well be the case that you

11

never reach a property interest in the enforcement

12

against somebody else, that that's a different thing

13

in kind from this traditional contract protective

14

services.

15

So if there was a statute that said, when

16

somebody has a protective order that implicates --

17

particularly when there is a finding of dangerousness

18

that's been made by a court that has nothing to do

19

with the restraining order that was issued here, and

20

that the police are obligated to provide 24-hour,

21

seven days a week police -- squad car out in front of

22

her house until she goes to testify at a hearing, for

23

example, that would be I think a property interest.

24

But it would meet the criteria that this

25

Court set out in Gonzaga, that it's defined in terms

of rights to her, not just benefits that might flow

from a criminal law more generally.

It's phrased in terms of the person

benefited and it has an unmistakable focus.

requirements.
JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the willful

12

and wanton -- suppose the facts were just as they

13

say, long-standing practice, not responding, doing

14

nothing, doing nothing here despite evidence of

15

serious danger, and being told you shouldn't do

16

anything, don't pay any attention he'll come home,

17

would that show willful and wanton?

18

MR. EASTMAN:

I believe under Colorado

19

law, that would show willful and wanton and their

20

tort claim would be available against the police.

21

But it's precisely because of that tort claim is

22

available and only on those limited circumstances

23

that I think you cannot read the Colorado legislature

24

as having created a property interest here, because

25

the remedies that would be available would not be so

We would not be limited to willful and

wanton conduct.

And you would go a long way toward making

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask you the same

question I asked your opponent?

Would you favor or

10

disfavor our certifying the property law issue to the

11

Colorado Supreme Court?

12

MR. EASTMAN:

Disfavor.

I think there is

13

just nothing in this statute that would even make it

14

reasonable for the Colorado Supreme Court to hold

15

that there is a property interest here.

16

And to go back to your earlier point about

17

Bishop, it's not a determinative rule.

deference to the Tenth Circuit.

19

Circuit's decision is not based on any even

20

developments in Colorado law, and based on a Colorado

21

statute and takes the step that this statute simply

22

doesn't comply with, I don't think you need to give

23

the kind of absolute deference here that you might

24

have given other cases.
