ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA MADIGAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. MADIGAN:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and

may it please the Court:
This Court has made clear on several occasions,

11

including 21 years ago in Place and 4 years ago in Edmond,

12

that a sniff by a drug-detection dog is not a Fourth

13

Amendment search, and if something is neither a search nor

14

a seizure, then it requires no Fourth Amendment

15

justification.

16

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, we've held that it's

17

certainly not a -- a full-blown search.

18

in the classic sense, but a Terry stop isn't an arrest in

19

-- in the classic sense either.

20

that is a kind of seizure.

21

It's not a search

We -- we have said that

Why do -- I think your -- your argument assumes

22

that this for -- for purposes of search analogies that

23

something is either a -- a full-dress search or it's not a

24

search at all.

25

of a kind of middle ground on searches just as there is on

Why isn't there a -- a possibility of -

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

seizures?

2

MS. MADIGAN:

Well, this Court made clear in

3

Arizona v. Hicks that it did not want to go down the road

4

of creating something known as a quasi-search so that

5

courts and police officers would be in the position of

6

trying to determine whether or not something was a search

7

or not.

8
9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, I -- I can -- I can just

imagine the problems, but I mean, what -- I think what's

10

-- what the -- what's bothering me about the case is that

11

if we persist in -- in saying that -- that it's -- that

12

it's an either and or question with no question with no

13

possible gradation, then I assume nothing prevents the

14

police from taking the dogs through every municipal garage

15

in the United States and I suppose there's nothing that

16

prevents the police from taking the dogs up to any

17

homeowner's door, ringing the bell, and seeing if the dog

18

gets a sniff of something when the door is opened.

19

-- we're opening rather a -- a large vista for -- for dog

20

intrusions, and -- and that's what's -- that's what's

21

bothering me.

22

that vista if there is a possibility of a -- of a middle

23

ground that would prevent it?

24
25

We're

Why -- why should we -- why should we open

MS. MADIGAN:

Well, I would start with the

reality that dog sniffs by their very nature, as this

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Court recognized in both Place and Edmond, are very unique

2

both in terms of the manner in which the sniff is

3

conducted, as well as the content of -- of the information

4

that the sniff reveals, so that a dog sniff is only going

5

to be able to reveal the presence or absence of

6

contraband.

7

individuals have no privacy interest in the possession of

8

contraband.

9

And this Court has recognized that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Does that imply that your

10

answer is yes to the question?

11

dog sniff is not a search, then the police are free to

12

parade up and down every street in the country with dogs

13

sniffing car trunks.

14

MS. MADIGAN:

Yes.

If we say, as you urge, a

Because a sniff is not a

15

search, a police officer would be able to take a

16

narcotics-detection dog down the street with him or her.

17

I can tell you that because of the limited resources -

18

and this is a point brought up in the Illinois Association

19

of Chiefs of Police amicus brief -- that that is not

20

likely to occur.

21

In addition, I can also tell you that in the

22

State of Illinois, the Illinois State police do not train

23

their dogs nor do they use their dogs on people.

24

only use them on objects.

25

They

But yes, in answer to both of your questions,

5
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

because a dog sniff does not constitute a search, dogs

2

could be used to walk down streets.

3

hypothetically, be used in parking lots, and at times they

4

are used in parking lots.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

don't have to make it up.

7

know that they're used in places like bus depots to -- to

8

sniff luggage that -- that passengers have carried through

9

on -- on buses.

10

MS. MADIGAN:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

They could,

But they are used.

I mean, we

From cases we've had here, we

Yes, they are.
And the republic seems to have

survived.

13

MS. MADIGAN:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I agree.
One could characterize those

15

episodes under the, quote, special needs doctrine.

16

mean, we are exposed to searches at airports that we would

17

not put up with walking up and down an ordinary street.

18

So the dogs at the terminals one expects nowadays.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

These aren't sniffs for -

2

MS. MADIGAN:

In the present case, Mr. Caballes

3

was traveling from Las Vegas, Nevada apparently on his way

4

to Chicago, Illinois.

5

Another officer overheard when Master Sergeant Gillette

6

called in to dispatch that he effected -

7
8

He was pulled over for speeding.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I interrupt, General

Madigan?

9

MS. MADIGAN:

10

You may.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

He was pulled over for

11

speeding at 71 miles an hour in a 65 miles an hour zone on

12

I-80.

Right?

13
14

MS. MADIGAN:

Yes, that is correct, Justice

Stevens.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Did they know in advance that

16

he was someone to look for?

17

arrest everybody on I-80 that goes 70 miles an hour.

18

done it many times myself is why -

Because I don't imagine you

19

(Laughter.)

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS: Inadvertently.

22

(Laughter.)

23

MS. MADIGAN:

24
25

I've

Inadvertently.

We always like to have you in

Illinois.
Obviously, the Illinois State Police have the

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

ability to pull somebody over whether they're going 1 mile

2

over the speed limit or 26 miles over the speed limit, but

3

there is nothing in the record to indicate that they were

4

looking for Mr. Caballes as he was traveling eastbound on

5

I-80 towards Chicago.

6
7

JUSTICE STEVENS:
time of day it was?

8
9

Does the record tell us what

MS. MADIGAN:

Yes.

It was approximately 5:10

p.m.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Thank you.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You -- you answered one of the

12

earlier questions about the possible intrusiveness of dogs

13

everywhere by saying, well, you don't have a privacy

14

interest in contraband, but that's never true.

15

have a privacy interest in the murder victim's body, but

16

you still have to have a warrant to go in and get it.

17

that -- that just doesn't work unless I missed something.

18

MS. MADIGAN:

You don't

You do not have a privacy interest

19

in contraband, as this Court has recognized in the

20

Jacobsen case.

21

So

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, but you have a privacy

22

interest in your person and in your place, and that's what

23

we're talking about.

24

doesn't help us.

25

MS. MADIGAN:

So that seems to me that that just

Well, there is a distinction

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that's made in terms of Fourth Amendment protections that

2

are given to homes and people versus cars.

3

Carroll case, it has been recognized that a warrantless

4

search of a car can be done if they found probable cause.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Ever since the

But that's because of the

6

nature of the place being searched not because of the

7

nature of what you're searching for.

8

MS. MADIGAN:

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Correct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Not necessarily.
So it just can't be that -- so

11

the fact that you don't have a privacy interest in

12

contraband, it doesn't seem to me -- I -- I don't think

13

you need that argument.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MS. MADIGAN:

17
18

I think you should use it.

I -- I plan on continuing to use

it.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why do you -- are you

19

sure that Kyllo, you know, the -- the imaging case, would

20

have come out the same way if the only thing -- the only

21

thing -- that the imaging could pick out is not any of the

22

other private activities in the home, but the only thing

23

it could possibly discern is a dead body with a knife

24

through the heart?

25

out the same way?

Are you sure the case would have come
I'm not at all sure.

MS. MADIGAN:

out differently than -

I would hope the case would come

3

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what Do you have any authority for

5

that other than Justice Scalia's speculation about how

6

this -

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10

-- how his Kyllo case might

have been written?
JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

What about a house and -- and

11

the use of a dog to sniff around a door access or a house

12

just because the police think, you know, it's possible

13

this is somebody growing marijuana in the basement or

14

something?

15
16
17
18
19

Is that all right?

MS. MADIGAN:

I would argue that, yes, it is all

right to walk a dog around a house, but then as Justice JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

How do you -- how do you

reconcile that with the heat sensor case then?
MS. MADIGAN:

The thermal imager that was used

20

in the Kyllo case was able to reveal intimate details of

21

the house.

22

presence or absence of contraband, and because of that,

23

that's where we suddenly get into the tension between

24

Kyllo and Place and --

25

A dog sniff is only going to reveal the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

What if the dogs get a little

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

more sophisticated in the future and can also smell a

2

certain kind of perfume, something like that?

3

the whole analysis change?

4

MS. MADIGAN:

Would then

Well, then you would end up in a

5

situation as to whether or not an officer had probable

6

cause when a dog, in fact, alerted.

7

the presence of perfume as opposed to narcotics, there

8

would be-

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

If he was alerting to

How would you know whether

10

the -- the dog -- I don't think the dog alerts, as I'm

11

alerting, for one reason or another.

12

MS. MADIGAN:

He just alerts.

Well, they're very well trained

13

dogs.

14

their handlers go through 320 hours of training, and

15

they're specifically trained to only alert to narcotics.

16

In fact, in the State of Illinois, the dogs and

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I just learned this morning

17

that some very well trained dogs that are trained to alert

18

for explosives will also alert for certain kinds of rubber

19

in a tire.

20

entirely possible that dogs would -- there will be false

21

alerts by -- by dogs because it's triggered by something

22

that -- that is not really anticipated.

23

They didn't realize that.

MS. MADIGAN:

And I think it's

One of the things that does take

24

place during the training of these narcotics-detection

25

dogs is to make sure that they are not alerting to things

11
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that are not narcotics or -- I don't know exactly how the

2

explosive training is conducted because we don't train our

3

dogs in Illinois for explosives, but they purposely train

4

them on narcotics not to alert to plastic wrap that is

5

frequently the container used for narcotics, not -

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So you would agree the

7

analysis would be different if there could be an innocent

8

cause of the alert as well as the contraband being the

9

cause of the alert.

10

MS. MADIGAN:

It depends.

The analysis would be

11

different if the dog was known to or had been trained to

12

actually alert to the non-contraband.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Or if that happened a large

14

percentage of the time.

15

the search is unreasonable if, for every -- every one

16

time, you -- you make somebody open his bag because the

17

dog actually smells narcotics, 99 times you make somebody

18

open his bag because he has apples in it.

19

wouldn't that go to the reasonableness of -

20

MS. MADIGAN:

I mean, surely you'd concede that

I mean,

Well, it would actually go to

21

whether or not that dog provided -- that dog's alert

22

provided probable cause to conduct a search.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do we -- we don't have

the probable cause question before us, do we?
MS. MADIGAN:

You do not have the probable cause

This dog was determined to be

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what again in your view is the

best distinction from Kyllo?

7

MS. MADIGAN:

Two things.

One, the thermal

8

imager used in Kyllo was able to reveal intimate details

9

that individuals -

10
11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Like what?

I thought it was

just heat?

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MS. MADIGAN:

Yes.

There was some disagreement on the

14

Court about exactly what it revealed, but in terms of

15

intimate details, it then allowed somebody -

16
17

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Excuse me.

What details?

It

is a device that measures heat.

18

MS. MADIGAN:

Because it could measure heat, it

19

could also potentially determine when somebody was taking

20

a bath, taking a sauna, and doing other intimate things in

21

the house.

22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

to my lady's bath in the opinion.

24
25

I think there was a reference

JUSTICE SCALIA:

A nice turn of phrase, as I

recall.

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

What was -- and what was the

second?

4

MS. MADIGAN:

The second one would be the

5

distinction between houses and cars and the protections

6

that houses are given under the Fourth Amendment, which

7

are far greater than the protections that people have in

8

their cars.

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, so you think if this

were a house, that the Kyllo case would apply?

11

MS. MADIGAN:

If this were a house in the

12

situation, it would certainly bring out the tension

13

between Kyllo and Place -

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wasn't there -- didn't Kyllo -

15

wasn't what -- what the Court was worried about in Kyllo

16

not just the relatively crude heat imaging that existed in

17

the case before it, but the prospect of more and more

18

sophisticated heat imaging which -- which we had evidence

19

was already in development that would enable you to see

20

people moving around a room?

21

to that.

22

what's going to happen with dogs?

23

that -- that this thing is going anywhere other than

24

smelling narcotics and smelling bombs.

25

I thought the case referred

Now, are we going to have more and more -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I -- I can't imagine

Well, but you would argue that

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the same rationale should apply if, instead of using dogs,

2

you had some sophisticated device that would buzz or ring

3

a bell or something whenever the odor of -- of narcotics

4

was present, wouldn't you?

5

MS. MADIGAN:

I would argue that.

So if there

6

was an ability to create a -- a mechanical dog, for

7

instance, we would again say that the use of a mechanical

8

dog sniff would not be a search and therefore would not -

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There's nothing magical about

10

the fact that it's an animal rather than a sophisticated

11

device.

12

being does.

It has better detection capacity than a human
That's the only difference.

13

MS. MADIGAN:

14

JUSTICE SOUTER:

You are correct.
In -- in discussing the -- the

15

answer to the -- the Kyllo issue, you've -- you place an

16

emphasis on the protection given to a house.

17

back to Justice O'Connor's question and my earlier

18

example?

19

dogs around the foundation of the house or take a dog to

20

the front door and ring the bell and see what it -- what

21

it sniffs when the door is opened -

Is it still your answer that the police can walk

22

MS. MADIGAN:

23

JUSTICE SOUTER:

24
25

Would you go

I would -- without there being a search

and hence no Fourth Amendment concern?
MS. MADIGAN:

Yes, Justice Souter, I would say

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that that is possible because the sniff itself is not a

2

search and it only reveals the presence or absence of

3

contraband, which is something that the individual does

4

not have privacy expectations -

5
6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But then -- then the -

then there is no significance in the house.

7
8

Okay.

MS. MADIGAN:

There is potentially significance

in the house because the -

9

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Well, when does -- when does it

10

occur?

11

is -- is a matter of significance for Kyllo analysis.

12

We're trying to draw a distinction, if there is one,

13

between Kyllo and this, and you say they can go to the

14

house.

15

the front door, et cetera.

16

fact, is functioning as a distinction at all.

17

I mean, if -- if -- first you say the -- the house

They can sniff the foundations.

MS. MADIGAN:

They can go to

I don't see that the house, in

This Court's precedents have shown

18

us that in fact Fourth Amendment protections are higher in

19

the home than they are in the car.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Oh, I realize that, but it

21

seems to me your basic argument, if I understand it, is

22

there is simply no search here, and because there is no

23

search here, it doesn't matter whether you're dealing with

24

a house or a parking lot or a car on the road.

25

is no search.

No search

So for purposes of -- if I -- I want to

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

understand your case, and as I understand it, for purposes

2

of your case, there is no significance in the house

3

because there doesn't have to be.

4

arise because there's no search.

5

MS. MADIGAN:

The question doesn't
Is that -

Justice Souter, that is absolutely

6

correct.

7

believe it's based on the precedents of this Court -- is a

8

sniff is not a search, and therefore it requires no Fourth

9

Amendment justification.

10

A search, as far as we are concerned -- and I

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You said there's no

11

disturbance of one's privacy and so that distinguishes the

12

dog sniff from some other governmental intrusions.

13

dogs can be frightening, humiliating.

14

there is some association with the idea that I have a

15

right to be let alone by my government and having a large

16

dog circle my car.

17

MS. MADIGAN:

But

It seems to me that

There are in this country millions

18

of dogs, many of the types of dogs that are used by

19

narcotics detection teams, such as Labrador retrievers and

20

shepherds, are identical to the pets that people own.

21

encounter them in the parks, on the streets, and I would

22

contend that an officer cannot be in the position of

23

making a determination as to whether or not the individual

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER A. WRAY

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

7

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WRAY:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

10

There's no dispute that respondent here was

11

lawfully stopped based on probable cause.

12

dispute that the entire stop took less than 9 minutes.

13

The question is whether a second officer's use of a drug

14

dog to sniff outside of that car during those 9 minutes

15

required some separate Fourth Amendment justification.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There's also no

Do you agree with -- with

17

General Madigan that it doesn't make any difference

18

whether the -- the dog is a -- is a mechanical instrument

19

or not?

20

Do you agree it makes no difference?
I thought that one of the -- one of the points

21

in -- in the imaging case was that this was a new

22

technology which didn't exist and that although the

23

ordinary rules in 1791 was that there was no search unless

24

-- you know, unless you enter the house or unless you -

25

you physically intrude upon the person's -- at least the

18
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

person's clothes, we made an exception to that rule

2

because of this new technology that enabled you to find

3

out things without having to intrude into the home or into

4

the person.

5

This is a dog and -- and they had that ability in 1791

6

just as they had it today.

7

no intrusion, there's no search -- there's no reason to

8

depart from that rule with respect to a dog although there

9

would be with respect to some sophisticated new technology

10

Now, but -- but this is not a new technology.

And the rule that when there's

that would enable you to find out all sorts of things.

11

MR. WRAY:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's correct.
It seems to me you shouldn't -

13

you shouldn't assume that -- that the fact that this is a

14

canine makes no difference.

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Are you going to rely on the

16

fact that dogs were trained to do this sort of thing back

17

in the 18th century?

18
19
20

MR. WRAY:

I'm going to rely on -- on three

distinctions between this case and Kyllo, Justice Stevens.
The first is that the three points that the

21

Court looked at in Kyllo were:

22

referenced, the fact that it's a home, the most sacred

23

place under the Fourth Amendment; second, that it revealed

24

certain intimate details; and third, that that was a

25

technology -

one, as has already been

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It was potentially revealed.

It did not actually reveal any details.

3

MR. WRAY:

As -- as General Madigan referenced,

4

there is obviously some disagreement within the Court on

5

that issue, but the -- the fact was that the technology in

6

Kyllo revealed information about heat in the house which

7

could be thought to reveal intimate details about the

8

house.

9

The third point in Kyllo, which I think Justice

10

Scalia is referring to, is that that was technology that

11

was not in general public use.

12

enforcement across the country since Place and before to

13

sniff everything from -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Dogs have been used by law

But not in 1790.

Not Did you come here You don't know that, do you?
Did you come here having

researched all about dogs in 1790?

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. WRAY:

Justice Kennedy, I cannot, I regret

22

to say, tell you what dogs were doing in 1790.

23

you -- and this is maybe a factual thing that might be of

24

interest to the Court -- that the dogs who train -- who

25

are trained to alert to detect things -- it's not that

I can tell

20
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

6

It's rather that they are trained to let the

So the smells that are coming out

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Do you really think this would

7

be a different case if the officer had a device that did

8

exactly what the dog -- dog did?

9

MR. WRAY:

We -- our position would still be,

10

Justice Stevens, that as long as the device only revealed,

11

as this does -

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

13

MR. WRAY:

14
15

I would think you'd take -

-- the absence or presence of

contraband, it would still be constitutional.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

Why do you rely on the -- in -

16

in distinguishing Kyllo, why do you rely on the house if

17

there's no search?

18

that there was a house involved there?

19

that as one of your three distinctions.

Why do you have to rely on the fact
You -- you listed

20

MR. WRAY:

We don't believe we have to rely on

21

it, Justice Souter.

We do believe that there were three

22

things that were important in Kyllo.

23

a home was one of those things.

24

a home, the fact that it was technology not in general

25

public use, and -

The fact that it was

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But that didn't go to whether

2

it was a search or seizure.

3

was an unreasonable search or seizure.

4

so?

5

to a home would not be unreasonable with respect to a

6

suitcase?
MR. WRAY:

8

JUSTICE SOUTER:

10

Don't you think

That what -- what might be unreasonable with respect

7

9

I think it goes to whether it

Yes, Justice Scalia, that's correct.
But -- but your -- is -- is it

-- I understand it to be your position that there simply
is no search here.

Period.

11

MR. WRAY:

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

13

MR. WRAY:

That is correct, Justice Souter.
It's because it's a dog sniff.

We would -- we would submit this is

14

not a search because, as this Court recognized in both

15

Place and Edmond -- and the Jacobsen case is also

16

significant because the Court said that the reason this is

17

not a search, there using the dog sniff by analogy, is

18

because it compromises no legitimate privacy interest.

19

The language of the Court in Place is

20

significant because it says that we are aware of no other

21

investigative procedure that is so limited in both the

22

manner in which the information is obtained and in the

23

content of the information revealed.

24

not only to why it's not a Fourth Amendment search but why

25

the use of the dog sniff during a probable cause traffic

That language goes

stop here, where it doesn't prolong the duration, does not

2

transform an otherwise lawful seizure into an unlawful

3

one.

4

JUSTICE SOUTER:

All right.

Do you -- do you

5

think it's -- it's reasonable to say that if the police

6

take dogs simply onto private property to sniff the

7

foundations of houses, if they take dogs to the front door

8

and ring the bell so that they hope the door will open,

9

that there is -- there is no compromise of a privacy

10
11

interest?
MR. WRAY:

Well, there would be a question as to

12

whether the officer, the human officer, that is, could be

13

on private property -- I take it from your hypothetical,

14

Justice Souter -- in the first place.

15

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -

Well, I mean, the Fourth

16

Amendment analysis after Katz doesn't -- doesn't depend on

17

trespass, and -- and you have said up to this point that

18

there is no search.

19

that we have had as a consideration in our minds

20

analytically whether it's fair to say that what the police

21

were doing involved any compromise of a privacy interest.

22

So I'm assuming -- I'm assuming that the police

And then you have quite rightly said

23

can at least get to the foundation with a dog and they can

24

certainly walk up to the front door and ring the bell.

25

And if they do that with a dog, for the purpose of letting

the dog sniff and alert, if there's anything to alert to,

2

is it fair to say that there is no compromise of the

3

privacy interests of the people who own the house?

4

MR. WRAY:

Our position would be -- the answer

5

to that question is yes.

6

resolve that issue to decide this case.

7

The Court does not have to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, we could separate

8

the home from the -- from what happened here and still

9

validate the search here if we held that it was a search,

10

but was a reasonable one since all you find is that the

11

person was carrying contraband.

12

that's disclosed.

13

thing with -- with regard to a house, which is a more

14

sacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an

15

unreasonable search.

16

we wanted to, couldn't we?

17
18
19

MR. WRAY:

It's the only thing

Whereas, if you -- if you did the same

We -- we could reach that result if

I think you could, Justice Scalia.

It's important to distinguish JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

On the other hand, if it were

20

a drug-selling neighborhood or around a park where drugs

21

are frequently sold, would it be legitimate in your view

22

for the police to take drug-sniffing dogs and walk around

23

the public street where cars are parked around that known

24

drug-selling area and see if they could sniff out some

25

contraband in the cars?

Is that okay?

10

You haven't interrupted anybody.

MR. WRAY:

Nobody is in the

In that instance, we believe that

would be acceptable under the Fourth Amendment.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you -- you give no

11

significance to the fact that this dog sniff was in the

12

course of a lawful stop where the citizen's rights had

13

already been curtailed to a significant extent?

14

MR. WRAY:

We believe, Justice Kennedy, that the

15

-- that that context here makes this an even easier case

16

under the Fourth Amendment, that is, the dog sniff not

17

being a search compromising no legitimate privacy

18

interests during the course of a lawful probable cause

19

stop, which we know from Atwater -- the officer could have

20

simply placed the woman under full custodial arrest and

21

taken her down to jail -- was not an activity that

22

transformed the seizure into an unlawful one.

23

The Illinois Supreme Court's concern and where

24

we think they got off track was that they were concerned

25

that the use of the dog sniff during this 9-minute traffic

25
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

stop was that it transformed it -- it used the language

2

that it transformed the sniff into a drug investigation.

3

We would submit that the Fourth Amendment is about the

4

reasonableness of searches and seizures and not about what

5

the scope of the government's investigation is.

6

that sense, the court got off track.

7

And in

These -- this is a -- this is a means that law

8

enforcement has been using properly in reliance on this

9

Court's decision in Place, reinforced just 4 years ago in

10

Edmond, for more than 21 years to detect everything from

11

drugs to bombs to smuggled -- we have beagles in the

12

airports that smuggle produce that's being smuggled in.

13

Dogs are used all over the country with great

14

effectiveness in law enforcement, and the -- we -- that is

15

a -- a technique that we want to encourage law enforcement

16

to pursue.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are there -- are there any

18

manuals for law enforcement officers with respect to the

19

time and place of using dogs, or it's just open season?

MR. MECZYK:

Justice Stevens, and may it please

the Court:

14

The State does not offer any Fourth Amendment

justification whatsoever in regards to -- in this case.

It argues instead that there -- there was no need for any

17

justification, and that is incorrect for two reasons.

that, you realize that there are billions and billions of

that one is in investigating something doesn't make it a

MR. MECZYK:

I think here the most distinctive

point here is that Caballes had already been stopped

they walked -- one of the hypotheticals that the Justices

asked my adversary in this case, when they asked, well,

what if they walked the dog instead around a -- parked

cars or parked cars at a stadium?

out if there's any contraband.

The answer was they are at

liberty -- the police are at liberty to use dogs to find

contraband.

with the Court in saying we have taken from your decisions

9

that a dog sniff is not a search.

And your -- Illinois I think was very candid

question because I think you may have an answer to it and

I want to focus you -

MR. MECZYK:

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm struggling, yes.
I want to focus you on the

15

question.

16

reasonable thing to do, but it isn't my approach, look to

17

the English definition of search.

18

Let's look to the Fourth Amendment because there are a

19

whole range of searches that don't even fall within the

20

Fourth Amendment in the sense that we don't need a

21

justification.

22

is one of those, whether it does or doesn't use the word

23

English search.

I think what you're doing, which is a

I say forget that.

And I take Place as saying that dog sniffs

24

So I want to know why it is that this dog search

25

is one of the ones that's a Fourth Amendment search, i.e.,

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company

Washington, DC 20005

1

one of the ones that requires a justification in terms of

2

what the Fourth Amendment is about, privacy.

3

MR. MECZYK:

It invades a public -- I'm sorry.

4

It invades a private space that in this particular case

5

the respondent Caballes had a privacy interest in, that he

6

wanted to exclude the whole world from going inside his

7

trunk.

That's the difference.

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but you don't respond to

one point in Place, if I remember correctly.

It must be a

10

legitimate expectation of privacy, and if the only thing

11

the dog can detect is something illegitimate, how can you

12

say there's an invasion of a legitimate expectation in

13

privacy?

14

MR. MECZYK:

Well, it is -- it's true that one

15

does not have an expectation of privacy in contraband, but

16

by the same token, I have an expectation or Mr. Caballes

17

had an expectation of -- of privacy of what's inside that

18

closed trunk, his car.

19

law.

20

true that the home is sacrosanct, but just because it's a

21

home, it's not a talisman where -- where the Fourth

22

Amendment no longer applies.

The Carroll doctrine is still good

We still apply the Fourth Amendment in cars.

Of course.

one who did the arrest for speeding, had a dog in the back

of his car, instead of having the second officer come with

the dog, would it have been permissible?

had conceded that it would be a different situation if the

dog was already there when the car stopped.

this scenario as it is except that when the officer gets

out of the car, his dog comes with him.

MR. MECZYK:

My understanding of the way this

3

works, Justice Ginsburg, is that he just couldn't go up to

4

the car without -- and the dog would alert.

understanding of the way these dogs are trained is that

they specifically -- that the officer has to walk the dog

understand what you meant in your brief when you said if

2

the dog had been in Gillette's car when Gillette stopped

3

Caballes, the situation would have been different.

4

MR. MECZYK:

I -- I think what I meant there -

5

there would have been -- it would have been purely

6

happenstance, almost like plain view.

7

-- without him even cuing the dog or starting to walk the

8

dog around, my answer to that Justice Ginsburg is that

9

that would have been all right.

10

It would have been

Except now that -- the more I think about it,

11

I'm not so sure that it would be all right.

12

to -- and the reason for that is I think in that case the

13

officer, if he could do such a thing and the dog would

14

alert, would be exploiting the situation, would just be

15

taking the dog and walking him around the car and seeing

16

that the dog alerted.

17

would be, I think, an exploitation of -- of the -- of the

traffic stop.

And my answer

So in other words, there -- there

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So then it really makes no

difference whether it was Gillette who had the dog in his

had the dog.

MR. MECZYK:

JUSTICE SOUTER:

It's the exact

that I have with that argument is take the -- take the

case of -- of the arrestable offense in which it is

undoubtedly the case that although the police don't

normally arrest, they -- they can.

8

understand your argument, you're saying if they, in fact,

9

do arrest, they may then take the dog around the car, and

Your -- if I

10

indeed, I presume you would agree, they could make an

11

inventory search because they've got to protect themselves

12

against claims that they lost property and so on.

13

there's no question that in that case, as -- as you have

argued it, they could make a full-blown search and -- and

certainly can use the dog.

How does that affect the reasonable expectation of

privacy?

To me, once a person is told that

If they have probable -- if they decide to arrest, even

11

though it's on a minor traffic case, such as Atwater,

12

which was a seat belt, as long as it's -- if -- if it's

13

minor and if the officer elects to choose to do a full-

that arrest are -- it's going to happen.

not?

Isn't your expectation of privacy identical,

the reasonable expectation of privacy depends upon the

Essentially yes, because I think

that the officer takes a physical action.

I think in Atwater,

unlike Knowles -- in Atwater, in that case, I think the -

the officer did make an election, and there was a full-

12

blown or a full-fledged arrest.

your reasonable expectation to privacy does, in fact, go

14

out the window.

And I think there your -

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA MADIGAN

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MS. MADIGAN:

22

Let me make three brief points.

23

Number one, Justice Ginsburg asked a question

Thank you, Justice Stevens.

24

about something that was in the respondent's brief,

25

whether or not it made a difference if a dog was with

Second, Justice Scalia asked a question about

11

plain view, and similar to plain view, a dog sniff does

12

not effect an incremental search or seizure.

13

therefore, similar to plain view, a dog sniff does not

14

require Fourth Amendment justification.

15

And

And let me finally acknowledge something that

16

Justice Souter brought up, which is whether or not, by

17

walking a dog around a house, you in fact would have a

search.

19

than whether walking a dog around a car constitutes a

search, which we say is not.

21

Let me -- now, that is certainly a closer case
