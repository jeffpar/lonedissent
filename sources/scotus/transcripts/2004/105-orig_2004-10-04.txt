ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN B. DRAPER

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

MR. DRAPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and

may it please the Court:

10

Kansas would like to address three issues today.

11

50 years of success of the Court's river master

12

on the Delaware River and 16 years of success of the

13

Court's river master on the Pecos River demonstrate the

14

wisdom of appointing a river master under appropriate

15

circumstances on a river like the Arkansas River, which is

16

the subject of this case.

17

Secondly, the Court should affirm the neutral

18

principle that prejudgment interest accrues on all damages

19

owing at the time interest begins to run.

20

And third, a 1-year compliance period would be

21

consistent with the Court's prior rulings in this case and

22

would preserve an essential right of Kansas and its

23

farmers under this -- this compact that would otherwise be

24

lost under the master's recommendation of a 10-year

25

accounting period.

1

With respect to this accounting period, I would

2

note that in both prior opinions in this case, this Court

3

has relied on the annual results of the Hydrologic­

4

Institutional Model, which is the standard for compact

5

compliance in this case.

6

In the first opinion in 1995, this Court

7

distinguished between monthly and -- and seasonal use of

8

the model, deciding that monthly use was too frequent, but

9

that seasonal reliance on the model for determining

10

useability under article IV-D of the compact was

11

reasonable.

12

When the case was back here in 2001, this Court

13

reviewed the calculation of damages, which was done on a

14

yearly basis.

15

into calculation of damages vary from year to year, and so

16

it is crucial whether the depletions calculated by the H­

17

I Model, as it's called, are accurate, sufficiently

18

accurate, and reasonable to rely upon on an annual basis.

19

As you can imagine, the factors that go

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Draper, correct me if I'm

20

wrong.

21

thought they did it on a 10-year basis and they just moved

22

it up each year, using a different 10 years to calculate

23

the -- the relevant amounts in the 10th year.

24
25

I -- I looked at these papers a while ago.

MR. DRAPER:

I

That is correct, Your Honor.

It is

a moving accumulation of 10 years of results.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So they do use 10 years of

2

figures to determine what the relevant year's water would

3

be.

4

MR. DRAPER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In

5

other words, the -- the annual determination includes the

6

most current year for which there is data and the previous

7

9 years, adds all those up, nets out the pluses and

8

minuses, and that determines whether in the year in

MR. DRAPER:

That is the special master's

proposal, yes.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

And what I don't understand is

15

even -- even if we agree with you that it should be done

16

annually, why -- why wouldn't you propose that it be done

17

annually using the previous 7 years' experience that we

18

now have and then, you know, ultimately by 2007, we can

19

use the previous 10 years?

20

have to do it year by year and forego even 7 years'

21

benefit of -- of this methodology.

22

MR. DRAPER:

I -- I don't understand why we

Your Honor, I couldn't agree with

23

you more in the sense that we should begin now with the

24

accounting so that you look each year at the results of

25

this standard, which has been approved by the Court, for

compact compliance in that year only, and if -- if you

2

accumulate it -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

That -- that's -- I said

just the opposite.

begin looking for this -- at this year only using this

6

methodology.

7

over the previous 7 years?

8

I said I -- I don't know why we should

Why shouldn't we average this methodology

MR. DRAPER:

Your Honor, averages will tend to

9

smooth out the results and will hide the effects during

10

dry years, which is when the farmers in Kansas, who are

11

the beneficiaries that Kansas intended to benefit -- and

12

both parties realize that.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They need this water -­
But your method -- your

14

method will over-emphasize the dry years.

15

you have a -- a imperfect situation.

16

by year, and in a dry year, Colorado perhaps must over­

17

compensate, and if you have, say, 3 dry years in a row,

18

then it's going to be -- work out to Colorado's

19

disadvantage.

20
21
22

MR. DRAPER:

So either way

In your case, year

Your Honor, I believe the -- the

result is the -- is the opposite.

If I may explain.

The model, the -- the Hydrologic-Institutional

23

Model, has been made as unbiased as possible.

The one

24

aspect in which we have identified a bias is that it

25

favors Colorado during dry years.

It tends to

1

underestimate the depletions that would have to be

2

replaced by Colorado.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the method that you're

4

attacking, but if you were to do it year by year, wouldn't

5

it be just the reverse?

6

MR. DRAPER:

We don't believe that aspect of the

7

model would be any different if we're doing it year by

8

year.

9

calculated each year under either approach and use those

10

in that year so that if you have a dry year, you are -­

11

are calculating in that year whether there is compliance

12

and staying as close as possible to the true intent of the

13

compact, which is to provide water when the farmers need

14

it.

We'd simply be taking the results that are

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you -- do you dispute what

16

-- what the master found here, that the methodology is

17

more accurate on a 10-year average than it is year by

18

year?

19

MR. DRAPER:

No, Your Honor.

The longer the

20

period of time you take, the more the accumulated results

21

of the model will match the measured -­

-- you can measure the flows and the diversions in the

2

river and compare that to one of the runs of this model,

3

but it's the difference between the two runs, one

4

representing the compact condition, which is supposed to

5

be met, and the other representing the situation with the

6

wells operating.

7

two whose accuracy is in question.

And it's the difference between those

Yes, but I -- I -­

And no one knows what that is.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that -- that the

11

master concluded that even as to a particular year, the

12

model will be more accurate if you use the average from

13

the previous 10 years than if you just applied the model

14

to a single year, that even as to the real results for

15

that single year, the model will be more accurate if you

use a 10-year average.

2

MR. DRAPER:

Not -- not directly, Your Honor.

It -- it does preserve that reservoir in fact because

depletion of that reservoir affects the stream flows, and

it's the stream flows that are compacted here and that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then -- well, then why

isn't -- if -- if that's so, why isn't it that Colorado

average?

to me that Colorado should be given some credit for the

wet years when the subterranean reservoirs are -- are

replenished.

You're concerned about the dry years.

It seems

it would not be a credit for accounting purposes.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

Well, if it's not a credit for

3

accounting purposes, then they're going to owe you just as

4

much the next year even though -- even though you had more

water the previous year.

6

MR. DRAPER:

This is under the assumption, Your

7

Honor, that they have already met their obligations in the

current year.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. DRAPER:

Yes.

And it will be available as a

11

practical matter to meet their obligations in a subsequent

year and be accounted in that subsequent year.

13

I would point out that this is very important

14

for Kansas farmers that the -- the water be received when

15

it is supposed to be delivered under the compact.

16

water is -- is not delivered, as required, in one year, it

have used it -- and the Court has relied upon it -- on a

And the model is inherently a yearly model.

MR. DRAPER:

Well, it -- it could be done that

12

way, and in fact, Your Honor, Colorado uses parts of this

13

same model in its own administration of groundwater

14

pumping, the same groundwater pumping for purposes of

15

protecting Colorado surface water users, and it requires

16

replacement of water on a monthly basis.

17

is possible.

18

So it is -- it

But we believe with the yearly accumulation that

19

-- that we have relied upon so far in this case and that

20

the Court has relied upon specifically for damages, that

21

that is an appropriate accounting period for this

22

particular purpose.

23

The proposal of Colorado is no, let's wait 10 years before

24

-- and -- and accumulate it with the other 9 years before

25

we require any replacement.

And that is -- that is our proposal.

But the basic similarity of the compacts is that

21

the status quo at the time of the compact was maintained.

22

There was an inflow/outflow relationship that needed to be

observed and was required to be observed by the compact.

24

It was expressed explicitly in the Pecos River compact by

25

a reference to an inflow/outflow method.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As I understand the system you

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the commission decided

to appoint an arbitrator.

Would the river master then proceed independently and we'd

MR. DRAPER:

Would the special -- pardon me.

resolution of an issue, then that would -- that would take

care of that issue.

It would be -- not be necessary to

have the river master address that, and it would be an

agreement of the States because it would either be an

agreement because they had literally agreed before the -­

MR. ROBBINS:
please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I think I will begin by discussing the river
master since that's where Mr. Draper left off.

17

I want to make it clear, first of all, that I

18

disagree with the assertion that the Pecos River Compact

19

and the Arkansas River Compact are similar in the way they

20

operate.

21

specifically state that it was -- it intended to hold the

22

level of -- of depletion of the system by man's

23

development to the 1947 condition.

clause by saying it is not intended to impede or prevent

2

provided that the waters of the Arkansas River are not

3

materially depleted in useable quantity for existing use

4

for the uses.

5

that there would be a -- a more flexible effort at using

6

the water of the river by water users in both States,

7

protecting the existing uses in both States from that

8

future development.

9

So the -- the Arkansas compact contemplated

Now, this -- this Court has appointed a river

10

master in two circumstances.

11

pointed out by Justice Ginsburg, the -- the special master

12

recommended that because of the specific circumstances of

13

the case, that in fact a river master was appropriate.

14

That was on the Delaware River and the Pecos River.

15

all other cases that deal with this issue where requests

16

have been made by -- by States without river -- without a

special master's recommendation, the Court has declined to

appoint a river master.

MR. ROBBINS:

Justice Scalia, that is absolutely

correct, but the difference is where compacts have

13

mechanisms within them that are designed to work out these

14

differences, I think it is in the Court's interest -- and

15

Colorado's position is and the special master's position

16

was it was in the Court's interest -- to refer these

17

matters back to those compact administrations.

18

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

You --

Counsel, do you think it's

any more likely today than in the past that the two States

MR. ROBBINS:

Justice O'Connor, I agree

22

completely with the special master.

The State of Colorado

participate in that.

the veto in any given case on whether an arbitrator will

be appointed.

MR. ROBBINS:

That is -- under the compact,

that's correct.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

important fact you need to glean from the special master's

report.

6

They did everything they could to

Now, the -- the other -- the only other point I

7

want to make on this is that the -- the -- it's -- it's

8

very important, in deciding whether or not a river master

9

is the appropriate course of action to determine -- and I

10

-- I mentioned this earlier -- whether or not the Court

11

wants to be in a supervisory position.

12

that the States are entitled to seek redress of their

13

concerns before this Court, and as you said in -- in

14

Oklahoma v. New Mexico, you have a serious obligation to

15

adjudicate disputes between the States where there are

16

actual and existing controversies.

17

that you would have a river master would not eliminate the

18

potential for those controversies.

19

way that you can get this matter off of your plate and

into the position that Congress recognized and -- and

21

directed is to follow the special master's recommendation

22

number 12.

think it very important, but I have this question.

4

your view that the other State waived its claim to the

punitive damages from 1985 back either by not arguing it

by which he proposed how the damages should be calculated.

14

Under the -- the master's formulation, which is

occur are advanced both for inflation, but then they are

Colorado's -- Kansas' view is that commencing in

-- in 1985, all of the damages from 1950 to the present

3

should receive prejudgment interest.

4

becomes, if you use the master's methodology, the -- the

5

current amount of money in 2002 dollars which Colorado

6

would owe Kansas is approximately $29 million.

prejudgment interest -- it would be $52 million.

the value under the master's formulation, which did not

charge prejudgment interest on the '50 to '68 dollars,

13

So from Colorado's perspective, having succeeded in our -­

14

in our exception that the year should be 1985 instead of

1969, we in fact, under the Kansas theory, lose some

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

8
9
10

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It's the position of the United States that -­

11

that we agree with Colorado and with the special master

12

that a river master should not be appointed in this case.

13

The compact between the States of Kansas and

14

Colorado sets up a commission that is responsible for

15

implementing the obligations in that compact, which has to

16

do with Colorado's obligations to deliver a certain amount

17

of water to Kansas.

18

investigating violations of the compact, and the compact

19

includes a dispute resolution mechanism of submission to

20

binding arbitration if the -- the States agree to that.

21

The -- the commission also certainly could use other

22

dispute resolution mechanisms and certainly would have the

23

authority to do if it wanted to.

24
25

The commission is also charged with

The States have agreed to that.

Congress has

enacted it into law, and this Court should permit the
41

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

parties to use that mechanism to resolve any disputes that

2

might arise in the future rather than putting a river

3

master in place under the authority of this Court.

4

Now, the Court has -- itself has frequently

5

stated that consensual resolution of disputes of this sort

6

is preferable to litigation.

7

pointed out, in the two river basins just north of the

8

Arkansas River, the Republican River and the Platte River,

9

the parties recently, after having a dispute, including

As the special master

10

these very same two States in one of them, have come to a

11

consensual resolution of the dispute that they had.

12

think that does show, as the special master pointed out,

13

that these -- the States can -- in fact, the disputes in

14

those cases also had to do with groundwater and the effect

15

of well pumping, among other things.

16

master pointed out, I think that shows that the States can

17

use a consensual mechanism to come to a resolution, and

18

this Court ought to continue its often-stated preference

19

for consensual rather than litigative type of solutions to

20

problems of this sort.

21

And I

As the special

If the Court were to appoint a river master in

22

this case, then I think the question would arise in any

23

future case in which you have two States that have

24

conflicting interests with regard to an ongoing activity,

25

as what happened with river compacts, equitable

apportionments, and in other areas, whenever there's an

2

inherently conflicting interest, the Court would have an

3

appeal that it should appoint a master to oversee a decree

4

or judgment.

5

would be directly contrary to the Court's other statement

6

in the area, which is not only that the Court prefers and

7

that it's far preferable to have consensual resolutions,

8

but also that the Court does not favor appointing agents

9

or functionaries to carry out its decrees.

10

And I think rather than -- that -- that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I guess we made a mistake

11

with respect to the Pecos River and what was the other

Delaware?

13

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

The Pecos River -- I mean,

14

there were a couple of differences, in addition to the

15

ones that Mr. Robbins pointed out.

16

not only the special master, but the parties in the Pecos

17

River case -- neither party objected to the appointment of

18

a river master or even to the more extraordinary step of

19

clothing the master with authority to make determinations

20

that would be reviewable only under a clearly erroneous

21

standard.

22

it.

23

One difference is that

In this case, there is a party that objects to

And I would -- I think there's another

24

difference that's important that the Court ought to keep

25

in mind.

At the time the Pecos River master was
43

1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

appointed, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 53(e), which

2

the Court has said that the Federal rules provide a guide

3

for this Court's original cases, rule 53(e) provided that

4

findings of fact by a master appointed by a district court

5

shall be reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and

6

the Court, indeed, used that mechanism for the -- it

7

provided that the river master in that case would be

8

reviewed under that standard.

9

As of 2003, rule 53 -- it's now rule 53(g) -­

10

provides that masters appointed by district courts said

11

their findings shall be reviewable only under a de novo

12

standard unless the parties agree otherwise.

13

at the present time -- and again, following the Court's

14

rule 17.2 that says that the Federal Rules of Civil

15

Procedure should be guides -- and I think they are a

16

useful guide -- the appropriate course here, if the Court

17

were to appoint a river master, would be to appoint one

18

whose findings will be reviewable de novo.

19

Therefore,

But that itself raises problems because if the

20

findings of the river master are reviewable de novo, it's

21

really just a continuation of the current litigation and

22

it doesn't really advance things any.

23

submit the evidence to the river master.

24

determinations, and then they'll come to the Court.

25

That's really more what the special master does at the

The parties will

2

current time.
So I think that under all of those

3

circumstances, both the Court's preference for a

4

consensual resolution of disputes, its disfavoring of

5

appointments of agents to carry out its decrees, the

6

Court's recognition that it's the Court's obligation to

7

decide cases of this sort and it can't -- it's not the

8

obligation of other parties to do that, and the commission

9

that Congress has put into place specifically to deal with

10

this kind of problem, and with a specific recognition that

11

there could be disputes and a provision for a dispute

12

resolution, I think that the Court should not appoint a

13

river master in this case.

14

As far as the prejudgment interest issue, it's

15

the position of the United States also that the special

16

master and Colorado are correct, and prejudgment interest

17

should not be awarded.

18

in -- to this Court in litigation that if a party -- when

19

the time comes to make objections, a party has to make all

20

of its objections if it wants the Court to hear them.

21

I think it's a familiar principle

In this case, the special master came up with a

22

recommendation in his third report about how to -- what

23

should happen with prejudgment interest, under which the

24

early years -- the -- the amount of the damages in those

25

early years would never be subject to prejudgment

Now, Kansas objected to that and said we should

5

made the objection that if you -- if the Court disagrees

6

with that, which it did, that the method that the master

had used to deal with the prejudgment interest as of 1969

8

was incorrect.

9

brought it to the Court and Kansas didn't do that.
