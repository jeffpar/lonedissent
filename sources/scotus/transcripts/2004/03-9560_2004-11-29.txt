ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONNIE M. MITCHELL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. MITCHELL:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Court has directed us to address, in

11

addition to the question raised in the petition for writ

12

of certiorari, the following question.

13

Federal constitutional claim properly raised before the

14

Mississippi Supreme Court for purposes of 28 United States

15

Code, section 1257?

16

Was petitioner's

Accordingly, we begin by addressing that

17

question and answering it affirmatively.

18

maintains, one, the standards for adjudicating State and

19

Federal claims of this particular type are identical -

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. MITCHELL:

22
23

Here, Howell

Where --

-- where they're labeled as

such JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- where was that -- where

24

was that maintained?

25

there were was this was a -- was it a lesser-included offense

Because I thought that below, all

3
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

under State law, and I didn't see below any reference to

2

the Federal Constitution.

3

MR. MITCHELL:

Justice Ginsburg, we believe that

4

the rule in Beck establishes that State law must be viewed

5

and State law is the determiner of whether an offense is a

6

lesser-included offense, but Federal law, the Federal

7

Constitution determines whether, as a matter of due

8

process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Eighth

9

Amendment concerns, whether an instruction must be given

10

as a Federal constitutional matter.

11

JUSTICE SOUTER:

And -- and the standards under

12

Beck are different from the standards under the roughly

13

comparable State rule, as I understand it, because under

14

the State rule, the lesser offense need not be an included

15

offense, in the technical sense; and number two, there

16

need not be, in the absence of a further instruction, a -

17

a limitation to the jury to two choices, death or

18

acquittal, so that unless one is very careful to raise the

19

Federal standard, simply raising the State standard

20

wouldn't do it.

21

MR. MITCHELL:

Respectfully, Justice Souter, we

22

would submit that Mississippi's own law says that it

23

embraces the Beck standard and that Mississippi's own

24

law -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Sure, it embraces it because

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

it's broader, which means that if you raise -- if you -

2

if you make a claim under the State standard, you are not

3

necessarily making a claim under the narrower, more

4

restrictive Federal standard.

5

MR. MITCHELL:

We would respectfully submit that

6

-- that in Mississippi, for example, as contrasted with

7

the statutory scheme that was present in Hopkins, the

8

Nebraska scheme, in the Mississippi scheme, Mississippi

9

has held that simple murder is a lesser-included offense,

10

and therefore, by definition that offense at least mirrors

11

what is required under Beck.

12
13
14

Now, the question of whether some other
lesser JUSTICE SOUTER:

What about -- what about the -

15

the Beck condition that in the absence of the instruction,

16

there must be a choice between -- the jury must be

17

confined to a choice between death and acquittal?

18

MR. MITCHELL:

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

20

In -That's -- that's not the same

in the State's scheme, is it?
MR. MITCHELL:

Well, we believe that -- that it

22

is the same.

23

cites, State v. Goodin, explains that.

24

of Goodin in the State's brief, as it appears in the

25

respondent's brief at page 23, we contend is not

And in fact, the -- the case that the State

2

case.

3

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Is -- is Goodin the case that

4

5

State law, the -- the jury has an -- an option to sentence

6

for life, as -- as well as -- as to impose the death

sentence?

MR. MITCHELL:

cited for that purpose, but an analysis of what the

Mississippi Supreme Court actually said at page 656 of the

11

Southern Reporter, 787, is this.

12

face the dilemma of the Beck jury.

13

alternatives in the guilt phase were to convict Goodin of

14

capital murder, simple murder, or to acquit him, which is

15

the very purpose that the later cases -- and Beck itself

16

explains.

17

for the Beck determination was that presenting only the

18

option of convicting of a capital offense or acquitting

19

was not constitutionally permissible.

20

The Goodin jury did not

Schad, for example, explains that the reason

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So -- so I just want to make

21

sure I know where we stand.

22

assumption I was making, that under Mississippi law, in

23

the absence of an instruction for a lesser offense, the

24

jury has an option not only to acquit or to impose the

25

death penalty, but an option of life with or without

You're saying that the

1

parole, that assumption is simply incorrect as a -- as a

2

fact about Mississippi law.

3

MR. MITCHELL:

No, I do not believe that is

4

incorrect.

5

correct is that under Mississippi law, the jury, because

6

of the bifurcated nature of the -- of the case, is given

7

at least the preliminary reference or preliminary

8

instruction that if there is a guilt verdict, then there

9

will be a sentencing phase.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

What I do believe is

But we submit that that is a

10

distinction that this Court has not adopted, nor have

11

other courts adopted because in this situation -

12

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But it takes you out of Beck,

13

at least arguably, doesn't it?

14

have you raised something that is necessarily on all fours

15

with Beck?

16

that simply raising a State claim necessarily raises the

17

Beck claim.

18

The -- the question is,

And given this sentencing scheme, we can't say

Isn't that true?

MR. MITCHELL:

Your Honor, we would respectfully

19

disagree with that position because of the analysis that

20

the Court has undertaken, for example, in Hopkins and

21

because of the analysis in Spaziano v. Florida.

22

cases, they were presented with schemes in which the jury

23

did not, of necessity, impose the death penalty.

24

the jury was confronted with exactly the same position -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

In those

verdict was -- was the death penalty.
MR. MITCHELL:

Well, the consequence of the jury

3

verdict may have been the death penalty.

4

Spaziano, the -- the jury returned a verdict of guilty.

5

The jury recommended life, but the judge imposed a

6

sentence of death nevertheless.

7

-- a three-judge panel then imposed the death penalty.

8

Those -- those differences in sentencing schemes we do not

9

believe separates the rationale of Beck which is the

For example, in

In the Hopkins case, the

10

danger of affecting the jury verdict by being faced with

11

the dilemma of either convicting of a capital offense or

12

acquitting.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Mitchell, my -- my problem

14

is even more fundamental than Justice Souter's.

15

that the rule in Mississippi is exactly the same as the

16

Federal rule in Beck, it doesn't seem to me that arguing

17

Mississippi law, just because it happens to be the same as

18

Federal law, amounts to raising a Federal question.

19

Conceding

Let's assume you have a -- a State law against

20

wire-tapping.

21

you ask that the evidence be -- be excluded because it's

22

contrary to the State law.

23

-- a Federal question when all you cite is the State law,

24

even though the effect under State law is the same as the

25

Federal effect under the Fourth Amendment?

It is unlawful.

And you -- you come in and

Have you raised a -- a Federal

It's not my

8
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

understanding that you've raised a Federal question.

2

MR. MITCHELL:

I do not believe that I would

3

have unless in that particular State, if its highest court

4

had said, we embrace the same standard and we apply the

5

same --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's all it takes for the New

7

York State Supreme Court, for example, to have said, well,

8

you know, our -- our wire-tap statute does the same thing

9

as the Fourth Amendment does anyway?

10

MR. MITCHELL:

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's all it takes?

I believe Thereafter, all you have to

12

do is cite the New York State statute, and you've raised a

13

Federal question.

14

MR. MITCHELL:

No, respectfully, Your Honor.

15

However, if the State supreme court has adopted not only

16

the same purpose, but the very language and has, in

17

effect, said, our ruling in these cases is controlled by

18

the same provision of law, whether a -- a decision of this

19

Court, as in the Beck standard that we believe Mississippi

20

has adopted, or if the court has articulated that the

21

United States Constitution controls this particular

22

provision.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, if -- but the

24

State standard always has to -- has to comply with the

25

Federal requirement, doesn't it?

9
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MITCHELL:

It always has to comply with the

2

-- with the Federal requirement, but as Justice Souter

3

pointed out, it may be broader, for example, in situations

4

where there might be a right to a -- a jury instruction on

5

a lesser-related offense.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

For So all it takes is a -- is a

7

single decision by the State supreme court which says that

8

our rule is no broader than the Federal constitutional

9

requirement, and thereafter all you have to do is appeal

10
11

to State law.
MR. MITCHELL:

Well, while we believe that is

12

minimally sufficient, we believe that thereafter it is

13

important certainly to raise a claim which puts the court

14

on notice of a -

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. MITCHELL:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course -- claim.
-- it does.

Why -- why is that

18

-- I mean, it seems to me counsel should stand up on his

19

two feet and say, we're raising a Federal question.

20

is that too much of an imposition when the statute

21

requires that you raise a Federal question?

22

have to go researching what the State supreme court said

23

several years ago?

24
25

MR. MITCHELL:

Why

Why do we

Where -- where it is generally

understood, as in this case, that the two claims are

10
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

interwoven, we believe the jurisdiction of this Court, as

2

the Court has said, is plain.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So we have to figure out in

4

every case whether the two claims are interwoven.

5

think -- do you think counsel for the defense isn't always

6

going to say that they're interwoven?

7
8
9

MR. MITCHELL:

Do you

I think counsel for the defense

would, indeed, contend that they were interwoven.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't think it's too much to

10

ask counsel for the defense to say, we are raising a

11

Federal question.

12

And it solves the problem.

MR. MITCHELL:

The -- the difficulty in saying

13

that we -- that we raise a Federal question is that

14

suppose, in this instance, the trial counsel and appellate

15

counsel, Mr. Lott, had said, the jury in this case is

16

presented with an untenable position, convicting of a

17

capital offense or acquitting.

18

raises a Federal question.

19

that that was a sufficient assertion of a Federal

20

constitutional claim?

21

the State contends, just as the amicus brief contends,

22

that this Court should adopt some inflexible rule that is

23

extremely and extraordinarily difficult to apply in the

24

context of, for example, a trial in Mississippi or North

25

Carolina where counsel understands the lifeblood of the

That's untenable and that

Would the State then concede

Probably not, and that is because

the petition.

7

lot of work.

8

to this issue, which is somewhere hidden among the 28, and

9

what it says is, there should have been a lesser-included

10

offense instruction and it cites three Mississippi cases,

11

which in turn cite one other case, and that -- that other

12

case says that the Mississippi rule has constitutional

13

implications and cites Beck.

14

supposed to be sufficient, I as a judge would have to, in

15

every one of these cases that's cited in these 28

16

different issues, start looking up the other cases in

17

Mississippi to see if there's some other place they cite

18

some other case that says something about a Federal case.

19

I mean, you see it's impossible.

20

MR. MITCHELL:

A judge is a human being.

There are 28 different issues.

He gets

That's a

He goes down one, two, three, four.

He gets

Well, I mean, if that's

And -- and we would concede that

21

but for the fact that in this particular instance, this

22

particular rule is so clearly identifiable.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it isn't even because,

24

after all, Beck talked about an instruction where the

25

choice was either convict the person of murder, death

12
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

penalty, or acquit him, and your case happens to involve

2

an instruction which said to the jury, convict him or give

3

him a life sentence or acquit him.

4

if -- if Beck applies to your case.

5

decided.

6

MR. MITCHELL:

So we don't even know
That's never been

Well, Your Honor, we would

7

respectfully submit suppose that the -- that Howell's

8

counsel here had called this a Schad issue, for example,

9

where a sentencing scheme somewhat similar to the

10

present --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't even know -- I am so

12

ignorant I don't even know if Schad is a Federal case or a

13

State case.

14

MR. MITCHELL:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

So I guess if he had, he should

have said Fed or U.S. or whatever it is so that I'll know.

17

MR. MITCHELL:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

And -- and -

Or -- or suppose -That doesn't seem like such a

burden.

20

MR. MITCHELL:

21

JUSTICE SOUTER:

23

MR. MITCHELL:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

State court judge as well.

Or -- or I -- I wrote it.

But Justice Souter Justice Souter was -- was a

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. MITCHELL:

Suppose, though, that this were

3

not -- were not a -- a lesser-included instruction case.

4

Suppose that what had happened in this case was that

5

Howell had stood before the judge and said, I'm asking for

6

you to appoint counsel, and the judge said, well, under

7

the law of this State, I don't have to do that.

8

Howell had responded, but the Supreme Court says that you

9

do.

Would that then be sufficient to raise -

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

probably pretty clear it's Federal.

12

MR. MITCHELL:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

17

Supreme Court?

Yes, that's

Well Maybe he meant the State

supreme court.

15
16

But then

MR. MITCHELL:

Maybe he meant the State supreme

court.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

I'm saying you

18

don't carry it to extremes.

19

but that isn't an extreme case we have.

20

the case we have, the State, and then three State cases,

21

and then referring to one State case that says that Beck

22

is -- is a constitutional implication citing Beck.

23

mean, I don't have to be extreme in order to say yours

24

isn't that extreme example.

25

MR. MITCHELL:

Don't be ridiculous about it,
We have which is

I

No, but we would say -- we would

14
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

say this, Your Honor, that the effort to federalize the

2

claim as was done in the Mississippi Supreme Court was

3

done in an effort to address the instructions as a whole,

4

and -

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, it isn't even clear

6

here that Beck would have been violated.

7

it, in -- in Mississippi the jury could have given a

8

sentence less than death despite the conviction.

9

that right?

10
11

MR. MITCHELL:

We would concede that.

Isn't

Once the

sentencing phase was reached.

12
13

As I understand

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes.

So I'm not sure if Beck

even applies on its own terms.

14

MR. MITCHELL:

It would be our contention, Your

15

Honor, that -- that Spaziano v. Florida, that Schad, and

16

the cases following Beck, Hopkins v. Nebraska even would,

17

of necessity -- or Hopkins v. Reeves -- I'm sorry -- the

18

Nebraska scheme -- would, of necessity, report to the

19

court the continuing vitality of Beck even under these

20

circumstances, but it -- it is a matter that we believe

21

was at least made fairly and reasonably presented to the

22

court.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Mitchell, what gives me

24

pause is that there are Mississippi cases -- you no doubt

25

know them -- where the court has seemed to think that the

15
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Federal issue under Beck was discrete from the State

2

issue.

3

striking because it says this doesn't run afoul of Beck,

4

and then it says, now we turn to Mississippi law on

5

lesser-included offense.

6

supreme court treated those two as discrete.

7

just say lesser-included offense, why should the Court

8

assume that you're talking about one rather than the other

9

when the Mississippi Supreme Court itself has made it

10
11

So I forgot the name of them, but one of them was

And it -- the -- the State
So when you

clear that it thinks they are discrete inquiries?
MR. MITCHELL:

Justice Ginsburg, we would

12

respectfully submit that -- that the State's recitation of

13

Goodin is not a faithful representation of what happened

14

in Goodin.

15

the lesser-included simple murder instruction, which

16

Howell seeks.

17

case appears at 787 So.2d, beginning, I believe it's, 639.

18

At pages 655 and 656, the court addresses the Beck issue,

19

and it says there that because the jury's alternative in

20

the guilt phase was either to convict of capital murder or

21

simple murder or to acquit, then and in that circumstance,

22

the Beck -- that Beck was not violated.

23

must look to our practice to determine whether a

24

manslaughter instruction should be given.

25

In Goodin, he was -- the defendant was given

It was a robbery case.

The report of the

It then says we

And it is for that reason that we respectfully

16
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

submit that Goodin does not attempt to distinguish Beck,

2

but in fact squarely addresses a Beck claim, although -

3

and we candidly admit -- Goodin's counsel did cite Beck

4

itself to the Mississippi court.

5

was phrased in precisely the same manner in which Mr.

6

Howell's counsel expressed the same claim.

7

Nevertheless, the claim

These claims, therefore, we would respectfully

8

contend, are not virtually identical but are in fact

9

identical.

But even if there were some minor variations,

10

some deviations, as this Court indicated would appear from

11

time to time, we contend that clearly that such identity,

12

such virtual identity is sufficient to raise the issue.

13

In this case, Howell's trial and appellate

14

counsel raised two issues with regard to the jury

15

instructions.

Those two issues themselves were

16

interrelated.

Those two issues were a whole.

17

issues related to whether or not there was sufficient

18

evidence to convict of robbery and whether or not -- or

19

attempted robbery rather, and whether or not there was a

20

basis to give a lesser-included instruction.

21

which he cites are State cases related to the necessity of

22

giving lesser-included instructions where there's an

23

attempted robbery and simple murder is, therefore,

24

included in that offense.

25

Those

The cases

He also, at the outset of his contentions with

17
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

regard to jury instructions, says that under the Eighth

2

and Fourteenth Amendments, these jury instructions -- and

3

Mr. Mitchell?

lesser-included offenses that might be urged by the

defendant as to -- to get an instruction on, and he asks

is a question here about exactly what is the lesser-

3

included offense.

4

-- if he killed the driver of the vehicle, there may well

5

have been some kind of crime.

lesser-included offense of, say, simple murder and the

facts don't fit simple murder, but they might fit

manslaughter or something else.

for a simple murder, lesser-included offense instruction

In other words, the question -- there

be sufficient if you should really have asked for a

is not a basis upon which to deny the instruction and

19

then, citing Beck, said that where there is a proper

20

lesser-included offense, the fact that the -- that the

21

defendant does not request the proper instruction still

22

rises to the constitutional proportions that a Beck claim

23

does.

24
25

And there, the defendant asked five times for

JUSTICE SOUTER:

The court said that that

1

guess, but one of the things that perplexed me was that I

2

would have thought that the lesser-included offense on -

3

on the theory that the -- that he didn't intend to kill,

4

he was sprayed with mace, got mad, pulled out a gun, and

5

shot and so on -- I would have thought the lesser-included

6

offense was a heat of passion kind of killing.

7

as I read the -- the statement of -- of simple murder,

8

which requires a deliberate act, that didn't sound like

9

it.

But as -

And I -- I read negligent homicide, and that didn't

10

sound like heat of passion.

11

here, if -- if we get into it, that as long as you asked

12

for some lesser-includeds, under Mississippi law that

raises the issue adequately?

that this simple murder was right and the -

which capital murder was not robbery murder as in this

21

there was an altercation between the sheriff and Mease.

22

2

said that that was a proper basis to instruct on

manslaughter, the fact that he had pulled the gun and was

using it during the course of the fight.

Now, while I find that case difficult to parse,

we believe that that certainly could have been an argument

that could have been raised and that, albeit it was not,

MR. HOOD:

Justice Stevens, may it please the

I'd like to make the point, as far as

jurisdiction goes, that -- that the defendant has failed

20

to make a Federal claim and he is required under Webb v.

23

it was not properly raised.

in one instance, we've -- we've become first in -- in this

regard.

which was cited in a footnote 10, I believe, in -- in

4

Beck.

5

same statute, pretty much, that Alabama had that

6

restricted a lesser-included offense instruction.

7

Mississippi said, number one, you cannot restrict that

8

lesser-included offense instruction if it is supported by

9

the facts, and number two, in the Jackson case, the court

In Jackson v. State in 1976, our Supreme Court -

In the Jackson case, Mississippi said -- we had the

10

held that it had to be bifurcation, which was the

11

problem, the impact on the guilt phase.

12

would submit to the Court that there is no impact in

13

Mississippi in this case on the guilt phase, nothing to

14

influence the jurors' decision, and that was the inherent

15

problem that the Court recognized in Beck.

16

And -- and so I

Number two, Mississippi allows a life sentence,

17

which also distinguishes Beck.

in a separate, bifurcated hearing, to determine whether or

19

not the defendant should receive life or the death

penalty.

21

It -- it allows the jury,

And then thirdly, in Mississippi, we have a

22

broader standard than the Federal standard.

23

lesser offense in Mississippi, then the defendant is

24

entitled to it if it's supported by the facts of the case.

25

So we have a broader standard that gives the defendant an

easier opportunity to meet that standard.

It

doesn't have to be a -- a lesser-included offense -

7

I don't get your point.

Yes, yes, sir -- so long as it's a lesser

offense?
MR. HOOD:

-- Justice Scalia.

It just has to be

a lesser offense.
And I would submit to the Court that if we are

11

analyzing a Federal constitutional issue, then perhaps we

12

-- we should follow Federal constitutional standards,

13

which was stated -- the strict elements test, in other

14

words, because under -- under Federal law, it has to be,

15

well, number one, a lesser-included offense, a true

16

lesser-included offense, and under the Schmoke case, this

17

Court has stated that that is in fact applying the strict

18

elements -

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I interrupt with a

20

question there, General Cox?

21

MR. HOOD:

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, sir.
In this case, if the man

23

approached the victim in the car and shot him and killed

24

him, as I understand it, and the theory was an attempted

25

robbery and therefore the -- the capital offense.

Now,

24
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

are you telling me that if they failed to prove there was

2

an attempted robbery, it was not an offense at all?

3

MR. HOOD:

No, sir.

I -- I'm not stating that.

4

It would -- it would be an offense, but based upon these

5

facts.

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Then why wasn't he entitled to

an instruction on whatever offense it was?
MR. HOOD:

Because the -- the facts in this case

show that there was no other reason for him to approach

10

that vehicle than to rob that individual.

11

premeditated intent.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

There was no

But his theory was if there

13

was a failure of proof on the attempted robbery, that all

14

was left was a -- a killing for some other reason.

15

there was a killing -- if there was a failure of proof on

16

attempted robbery, would he not then have been entitled to

17

a -- a lesser offense instruction?

18

MR. HOOD:

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. HOOD:

21

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, sir, Justice Stevens.
So what your theory is then -

It depends on -- if I understand it

22

correctly, is the proof that there was an attempted

23

robbery is so convincing that no other theory was

24

available.

25

MR. HOOD:

MR. HOOD:

It could arguably be a felony murder,

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So I'm going to say which Let's make it -- if we make

15

it concrete, let's take all that we have in this case is

16

the testimony that Rice gave.

17

observed this murder, and he didn't have any statements

18

about the defendant needing money to pay off his debt.

19

You have only that snapshot scene of what the witness saw

20

from the window, which doesn't establish any robbery at

21

all because Rice said he didn't observe any robbery going

22

on.

23

you have in this case, a person was killed, an eyewitness

24

to the shooting, the eyewitness testifies exactly as Mr.

Rice did in this case, what crime would you indict for?

Rice was the one who

MR. HOOD:

Yes, sir.

And -- and there again,

6

I'd like for the Court to -- to understand my statement

7

that we should construe this on what -- how the Federal

8

law -- how you -- how the Federal courts construe it, not

9

use Mississippi's lesser standard, but let's -- let's

10

construe it on whether or not, first, it is a true lesser-

11

included offense because that's -- that's what the Federal

12

standard is, and that's what we followed in Nebraska.

13

And secondly, if it's a true lesser-included

14

offense, we have to use the analysis of the Federal courts

15

which says that it has to use the strict elements test.

16

Well, murder would not be a lesser-included offense under

17

Federal law because under the Mississippi capital murder

18

statute can be with or without deliberate design.

19

Therefore, there is no deliberate design.

20

a lesser-included offense of murder.

21

not be a lesser-included offense under that same elements

22

test because it requires the additional element of sudden

23

provocation or heat of passion.

His defense was alibi and so he didn't take the

And -- and I was the district attorney who tried

this case, so factually I -- I remember the -- the -- my

argument was that we couldn't have proved murder if we had

wanted to because there was no premeditation.

20

JUSTICE SOUTER:

May I go back to the heat of

21

passion point?

22

wasn't there evidence in the record through a State's

23

witness that at least would have supported a heat of

24

passion argument, the evidence being that he went up to

25

You say he did not put on evidence, but

MR. HOOD:

There are two possibilities that were

21

not requested.

22

Felony murder is -- is the killing of -- that occurs

23

without occurring with one of the seven offenses that we

24

have listed, murder, rape, and so forth, committing

another crime.

One is our felony -- felony murder.

And I

would submit to the Court that -- that they never

requested anything about the felony murder and they never

requested the heat of passion manslaughter.

JUSTICE STEVENS:

May I ask this question just

5

to help me sort of -- what are the -- as a matter of State

6

law, what are the elements of the offense for which he was

7

convicted?

8
9

MR. HOOD:

Elements of the offense are that he

-- that he -- a killing occurred with or without intent

10

and that it was in the commission of -- of a crime,

11

robbery.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Those are the two elements.

13

And so that if you take out with -- in the commission of

14

another crime and just left the -- the other part of it,

15

would that also be an offense?

JUSTICE STEVENS:

In other words, you say -- you

say the offenses are killing somebody with or without the

intent to do so -

JUSTICE STEVENS:

MR. HOOD:

It -- if you -- if you prove the

JUSTICE STEVENS:

And if he is, why isn't it a

lesser-included offense is my next question.

6

MR. HOOD:

Yes, sir.

If you just take those

7

away and you just have those two elements, with or

8

without, if it's with intent, then it would be classified

9

as murder.

If it's without, it could possibly be -

10

without intent, then it could be classified as

11

manslaughter.

12

JUSTICE STEVENS:

It seems to me that then there

13

are two lesser-included offenses, and either one would

14

have -- he should have gotten an instruction on both.

15

MR. HOOD:

16

JUSTICE STEVENS:

17
18

I -- I And I don't understand why

not.
MR. HOOD:

Yes, sir, I understand.

But there

19

again, if we go back to what the Federal standards are,

20

we're talking about what the United States Constitution

21

requires, and therefore, I would submit to the Court that

22

we should apply what the Federal law is.

23

-- number one, is it a lesser-included offense?

24

elements test, murder is not a lesser-included offense to

25

capital murder, and the reason being is because capital

And that law is
Using the

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

murder is with or without intent and you add an additional

2

element of murder which requires intent.

3

manslaughter because you had the additional sudden

4

provocation element.

5

Same goes for

So I would say that if we follow the Federal

6

standard and -- and that's -- that's the floor, and the

7

floor is it's got to be a lesser-included offense, it -

8

it's not a -- a lesser-included offense.

9

that should answer the question.

10

So therefore

Secondly, under the Federal standard, you have

11

to prove that -- that the court -- the judge has to decide

12

that the -- a reasonable juror would acquit of the greater

13

offense and also convict of the lesser.

14

law does not require that, but I -- I'd submit to the

15

Court that -- that after the Beck decision in 1980, our

16

supreme court in the case of In re Jordan -- they applied

17

the Federal standard.

18

analyzed Beck, they applied the Federal standard, in other

19

words, the -- the part about that you have to acquit.

20

have to acquit on -- on the greater offense.

21

also included the lesser-included offense language in that

22

Beck analysis.

23

assume that's his claim, and let's assume the judge says,

contention that both Mississippi law and due process law

3

requires a judge to instruct a jury on all of the relevant

issues in the case, on all the relevant law in the case.

And in Fairchild v. State, that is precisely what the

Mississippi court did in saying that a court could not

simply conclude, no matter how strong the evidence of

8

attempt to rob or plan to rob, that it could, in effect,

direct a verdict and not instruct on lesser-included

offenses.

Your Honor, those are the ones

submit that under these circumstances, there was a basis
