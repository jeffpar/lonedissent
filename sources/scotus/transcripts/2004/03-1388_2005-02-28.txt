ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:

10

The petitioners in this case are American

11

citizens who took cruises to and from this country on

12

tickets bought here that call for the application of U.S.

13

law.

14

U.S.-based company on the land, in the ports, and in the

15

waters of the United States.

16

They were subject to discrimination by respondent, a

The question presented is whether the Americans

17

With Disabilities Act applies or instead whether

18

respondent's conduct is lawful because the case is

19

controlled by Bahamian law, which freely permits cruise

20

lines to discriminate against persons with disabilities.

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire

22

of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU

23

area, have applied their own disability laws to some of

24

the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice O'Connor, our research

does not reveal that the question has arisen in the EU.

2

can, however, provide you some information, and that is

3

that -- two points I think.

4

I

The first is they subscribe -- the members of

5

the EU subscribe to the same conventions and to UNCLOS

6

just the way we do, which gives the port state plenary

7

authority within its ports and internal waters.

have a couple of case citations for you on this issue.

the Mateo Peralta case, 1994, ECR I-3453.

11

It has not arisen in the EU, but it has arisen

12

in Australia.

that law to cruise ships, and the rule in Australia is

14

that the port state law applies rather than the flag state

15

law.

16

17

those numbers mean.

Australia has a disability law.

It applies

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And would you also address at some point how the

treaty on Safety of Life at Sea would affect the

21

resolution here?

22

requirements that there be watertight doors and those

23

doors have to be set above the level of the floor so you

24

couldn't roll a handicapped wheelchair or something over

25

it.

For example, it has, as I understand it,

Now, do you anticipate that there would have to be

4
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

structural changes if you were to prevail that would

2

conflict with the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea?

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

No, and you have put your finger

4

on the point, and that is that there are no conflicts.

5

know that for a couple of reasons.

6

We

The first is that there has been a detailed

7

rulemaking underway in which the regulatory authorities

8

charged by Congress with implementing the ADA have spent

9

quite some time.

10

They have produced this single-spaced,

half-inch thick document that is dedicated to making -

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Are they in effect yet?

They are not, but in terms of

13

whether or not the statute, when it's applied, would

14

conflict, you would look to this document and they took as

15

their regulatory mission to make sure there were no such

16

conflicts.

17

specifically and then put -- place it within the statutory

18

framework.

19

What they did -- let me take your example

Within the ADA and a question of the combings,

20

what they said is, that's right.

21

requires that the coamings be a certain height.

22

coamings are below the bulkhead level, where you would be

23

worried about water coming in below, that is not an

24

accessible route, and so you don't have to worry about it

25

at all.

In certain cases SOLAS
If the

Above there, you ramp up to the coaming and ramp

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

down, unless that's structurally infeasible.

2

what they did is they -- and this is the broader point.

3

they applied the rule of the ADA that a change to the

4

structure of the vessel only has to be implemented if it's

5

readily achievable.

6

determined is that if there is any conflict with SOLAS at

7

all, that change need not be made.

8
9

So they -

And what the regulatory authorities

Now, you -- Justice O'Connor, you also focused
on the fact that there are some of our claims that

10

implicate the structure of the ship.

11

distinct minority, and we ought not lose sight of this

12

because I don't think the other side has any good argument

13

at all, under international law or anything else, that

14

would explain why they can charge a person with a

15

disability double.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They are, however, a

Can you tell me just a little

17

bit about that, how it works?

18

this case -- and it does seem to me that the -- the

19

charging the double doesn't involve modification of the

20

ship, obviously.

21

an English passenger who buys an English ticket and is

22

charged double -- I don't know if that's the English law,

23

but let's assume -- then he comes on a cruise ship and he

24

goes to New York and Miami and -- and New Orleans?

25

-- does he -- could he then sue, if -- if we rule for you

Suppose that you prevail in

How does it work if you have, oh, say,

Can he

6
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

in this case?

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I would think on the question of

3

the charging double, the answer to that question would be

4

no because it would present a traditional, not unique to

5

the ADA, choice-of-law question, and that is, if you're in

6

England and you buy a ticket in England, your ticket is

7

going to be subject to English common -- in that case, the

8

English disability law.

9

law.

10

There is an English disability

It doesn't discuss cruise ships.

It's -- but it's

broadly written.

11

But with respect to the structure of the ship, I

12

think that English passenger with a disability -- say that

13

you come across to the United States and you want to get

14

off in New York.

15

that that person would be able to come off a -- off the

16

dock in a wheelchair, back onto the dock on the

17

wheelchair; while you were in U.S. ports and you're

18

staying in your cabin, that you would be able to, in your

19

accessible -- your accessible rest room, have grab bars.

20

I think that Congress clearly intended

We are -- and -- and let me not pass too quickly

21

by the fact that even when we talk about some structural

22

changes in the ship, by and large we're talking about

23

things that have nothing to do with -- Justice O'Connor,

24

you focused the name of the treaty is the Safety of Life

25

at Sea.

Whether the bathroom doors swing in and out has

7
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

nothing to do with that.

Whether there is -

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Goldstein, may -- may I

3

take it from your answer that it doesn't make any

4

difference in your view, your answer to the question about

5

the -- the ship leaving from a port in England and going

6

many places and touching base in New York, that kind of a

7

voyage, or what this case seems to be where the vast

8

majority of the passengers are from the United States, the

9

port of departure is in the United States, the port of

10

return is in the United States.

11

distinguish those cases because you say in the New York

12

port, it doesn't matter if it's really a U.S.-centered

13

cruise or a cruise centered in Italy or any place else.

14

Is that correct?

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I think your formulation is

16

exactly right, Justice Ginsburg.

17

where the cruise is centered.

18

You don't seem to

It doesn't matter to us

We do, however, and this Court's precedents do,

19

however, leave room for a highly unusual cruise that I'm

20

not aware exists.

21

a cruise comes from England to the United States.

22

doesn't pick up any passengers here.

23

They stop in 15 other countries.

same passengers get up on the ship and leave.

the more usual situation -

Then you are, in effect,
Even if the home

10

handicapped, you are, in effect, saying no matter what the

11

other ports say, what the U.S. law is is going to govern

12

because practically if you're going to design the ship to

13

meet the U.S. requirements, you're not going to rip those

14

out when the ship goes elsewhere.

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, we disagree

16

with the characterization that the U.S. rules the world,

17

of course.

18

exercised its sovereign authority to control vessels in

19

its ports and internal waters, just as in -- take the

20

Cunard example.

21

-- and I understand it didn't involve the structure of the

22

ship, but the principle is the same.

23

that required alcoholic beverages to be on those vessels,

24

and -

25

We're talking about the fact that Congress

In the Cunard case, there were countries

require ships that are docked in the United States to pay

2

their crews according to United States Jones Act

3

requirements or United States minimum wage laws and so

4

forth.

5

because it conflicts with -- with the law of the flag and

6

-- and that's the usual -- it's not a matter of our power

7

to do it.

8

something we ordinarily do.

9

We don't do that.

We could do it, but we don't

We could do it, of course, but it's just not

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I actually

10

disagree with your characterization and would like to

11

point you to a couple of precedents.

12

McCulloch cases, which are very important to the

13

respondents, were very important to the Fifth Circuit,

14

embody the principle that you just described, to some

15

extent, and that is that when you have a foreign ship in

16

our waters, we will not apply the NLRA to the labor

17

contract between the foreign crew and the foreign vessel.

18

But when Americans are involved, we do apply the NLRA, and

19

that's the Ariadne precedent that the -- and -- and in

20

fact, Ariadne is the most on-point case because it -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The Benz and

Was -- was that the ship or was

it longshoremen?
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It was longshoremen working on

the ship complaining about safety conditions on the ship.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Longshoremen.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's a different But it is a different situation,

but I think it's more analogous.

8

the foreign-flagged vessel, but they were directed at the

9

passengers.

10

Not only were the -- the

If I could -

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's -- what's the scope of

11

what you're talking about here?

12

cruise ships.

13

that carry people mostly around the Mediterranean from

14

Florida.

15

you're talking about something more.

16

example, about a merchant vessel that comes from, say,

17

Saudi Arabia and has a few passengers?

18

what's the scope of the definition?

19

I mean, are -- it says

So I had assumed those are those big ships

But based on what you're saying, now I think

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Are you talking, for

What's the -

The -- well, that -- the

20

definition -- we would have to return to the ADA.

21

merchant ship has a few passengers, it would not be a

22

specified form of public transportation or a public

23

accommodation.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because?

If a

It -- what it does is

it carries oil, but a certain number of people like to be

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's cheaper.

It's cheaper

too.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I'm not aware of -- of No, no.

I -- but all right.

Now, I'm -- I'm being facetious.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
But I am aware of -- of people

12

who have certainly gone on cruises on what is a primarily

13

merchant ship.

thing.

Now that -- that I think is a common

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- let me Are you talking -- because I

17

think that makes a difference for the reason that once you

18

talk about those, you're talking about primarily foreign-

19

flagged vessels that are rarely but sometimes in the

20

United States where the costs would be very high probably

21

to change the ship and the benefit to Americans would be

22

tiny.

23

talking about.

24
25

All right.

So I -- I want to know what you're

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

Let me first say -- and

Justice Scalia, you also gave the example of the

Jones Act, but remember that the Rhoditis case and the

Uravic case, which involved injuries in the United States,

then the Jones Act did apply.

8

Rhoditis was a case in which someone was on the ship and a

chain broke and they were injured as a result of it, and

U.S. law applied.

11

This is a situation in which millions of people

12

in the United States are spending billions of dollars on

13

cruises, and it seems -

14

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Yes, but I -- if I understand

you correctly, your case really isn't limited to cruise

16

ships.

ships, which would include the Queen Mary and Queen

relevant to the legal issue.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Is it?

It -- it is in the sense that it

makes this the recurring scenario that Congress would have

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But, of course, they would

have been aware of those that are also less American in

their patronage and so forth.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That's true.

In the very rare

6

case, which I am not aware of, in which a cruise ship

7

comes to the United States, doesn't pick up passengers,

8

then it's possible that the -- that the ADA would not

9

apply.

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

No, but we're not necessarily

thinking of a cruise ship, just the transatlantic liner

JUSTICE BREYER:

But there's no way they can

have it changed structurally when it's in Europe.

19

mystery to me at this moment is what is the universe of

20

ships that I would not say fit the ordinary word cruise.

Washington, DC 20005

1

that were your case, I would be very worried.

2

just a little bit of -- of added significance, then I want

3

to know what to do about it.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

If that's

Let me tell you what I know, and

that is that the other side has not identified any

the United States.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you told me -- and I want

13

to make sure this is your answer -- that it doesn't

14

matter, that as long as the ship comes to a U.S. port as

15

part of this overall journey, you -- you answered that

16

question and I thought that was your candid answer, that

17

it doesn't matter that these -- these particular cruise

18

ships ply mostly U.S. waters and U.S. trade and are

19

centered, even have their principal place of business in

passengers.

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, here I think

3

is the difference, and that is, that while U.S. law may

4

have an extraterritorial consequence, just like our

5

maritime tort law and the like, you cannot in Europe

6

whether applying the ADA to a public accommodation that

We think the better view, in

be because the accommodation that was offered, that was

MR. SALMONS:

That's correct.

Is that it?
Now -- now, I -

I would just add that I think it -- you could characterize

a public accommodation, you know, five nights lodging, for

12

example.

13

-- and that begins in the United States, that a necessary

14

term of that is nondiscrimination, and -

If that's entered into in the United States and

15

JUSTICE STEVENS:

16

MR. SALMONS:

Well, then if you --

-- if you have an ADA claim that

17

governs that even if the discrimination occurred abroad,

18

that would only relate to those things tied into the

19

accommodation.

20

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if you're on a round trip

ticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend

22

on where you bought the ticket.

23

MR. SALMONS:

Well, again, we -- we think that

that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination.

whether you characterize that as a contract claim or as a

substantive application of the ADA, I'm not sure there's

much of a difference.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool.

be, sure, United States law could apply to it because it's

13

in our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter,

with regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be a

MR. SALMONS:

We are trying

And what I would say

with regard to that is that you're right that our broad

10

view is that the ADA applies if that -- if they're

offering public accommodation here in the United States.

12

But if you reject that, I think there are

13

several ways you could approach that.

14

apply traditional choice-of-law factors that are -- that

15

are applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you

16

know, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient

contacts here and whether or not -

something that -- that would -- would help his concerns.

those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're

not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of

those ships that there are are already subject to tougher

either of those.

MR. SALMONS:

Since you don't you say either

of those, I think neither may be true.

MR. SALMONS:

Well, I don't know the specific

10

number.

11

that this -- what you're concerned with primarily here are

12

cruise ships that are in the business of providing public

13

accommodations.

14

I would think that there are not many that the -

But I would add as well -- and I think this is

15

very important that the Court keep in mind -- that the

16

clear statement rule, as it's -- as it's posited by

17

respondent here, would not just apply to the ADA.

18

would apply to all U.S. laws, and that would include title

19

II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in its prohibition of

20

racial discrimination, and I would find that that would be

21

a remarkable construction.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

it has referred to the internal order doctrine.

is embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go

in the Wildenhus's Case expressly said that if the -- if

additional requirements.

That would mean -

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Mr. Salmons, one of the

16

alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear

being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that

19

it was intended to exercise the -- the fullest extent of

respond to that by saying you could have said exactly -

Civil Rights Act of 1964.

So I take it that you are

10

saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the

11

ADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public

12

accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would

13

be inapplicable.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

It's all a question of

15

congressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no

16

indication of an intent that Congress needed to address

17

any problem that arose with respect to that form of

18

discrimination.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So your -- but your answer

20

is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in

21

at a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its

22

passengers on the basis of race.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, there would be no U.S.

24

congressional statute that would address that, Justice

25

Ginsburg.

There would be a violation of the Bahamian

1

constitution which prohibits -

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm asking about the U.S. law

3

and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in

4

places of public accommodation.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

As I said, I'm not aware that

6

there has ever been an instance of that in the cruise

7

industry.

8

about foreign ships here.

9
10

Congress has not addressed that.

We're talking

And I want to get back to the structural
features of the ship because the ADA fundamentally -

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

12

question, and what is your position?

13

engage in racial discrimination while in U.S. ports on the

14

selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations

15

while in U.S. ports and within the 3 -

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, but this is a good
That the ship could

Justice O'Connor, our position

17

is that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so

18

there is no congressional statute that is on point.

19

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Then your answer, I take it, is

20

yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because

21

Congress has not told it not to.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

No.

Is that it?
Our position is that

23

it can't discriminate because a different law proscribes

24

that -

25

JUSTICE SOUTER:

So far as United States law is

34
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

concerned, it could.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.
And the same answer for 1981?

Justice Ginsburg, as I said,

5

Congress has not extended its laws to the full reach of

6

U.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained that

7

position ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago,

8

The Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, let's put it this way.

10

So my understanding of your answer is that we could write

11

an opinion ruling for you but leaving these other

12

questions open?

13

I don't see how we can do that.

MR. FREDERICK:

What you say, Justice Kennedy,

14

is that the clear statement canon requires Congress to say

15

when it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel.

16

Congress didn't do that.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if I'm writing the opinion

18

and I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that

19

I then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in

20

the negative.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

You do, Justice Kennedy.

And

22

just as this Court in the ARAMCO case said that title VII

23

doesn't apply to the foreign -- work in a foreign land by

24

an American company of an American -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But these -

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn't

2

extended criminal laws of the United States to the full

3

reach of U.S. power.

4

that will apply in the special maritime jurisdiction.

5

It is only proscribed 15 offenses

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick, this is -

6

this is what concerns me about your answer.

7

Mr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter

8

what kind of operation this is, but the operation that

9

we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- what

10

percentage of its passengers are from the USA?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

12

three-quarters in any given year.

Approximately two-thirds to

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

17
18

I know that

And does it normally start

The majority of them do.
And how much of its

advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?
MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Ginsburg, there -- all

19

of those questions are going to be answered as a

20

predominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the

21

U.S. market.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, this is the anomaly.

23

You're asking us to buy an interpretation.

24

is U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business

25

and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is

An enterprise

36
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to

2

customers, passengers, and employment.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

And the reason, Justice

4

Ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on

5

vessels that go to other ports.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why don't you -- why don't you

7

try to draw that line?

8

applicability or not may depend upon whether you're

9

dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're

Why don't you say that just as the

10

dealing with an American who happens to be injured on

11

board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the

12

anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least

13

in some of its applications requires structural changes or

14

not?

15

but would not compel you to say that title II doesn't

16

apply.

That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply,

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19
20

We are talking You're not willing to take such

a limited position.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Scalia, I think

21

the Court could certainly carve out in its clear -

22

articulation of the clear statement principle some of

23

these lines.

24
25

It becomes very -

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, the ADA itself makes an

exception for things that aren't readily achievable.

I

37
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

mean, you could certainly lean on that because a

2

structural change probably isn't readily achievable.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice O'Connor, Congress, when

4

it talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of

5

cost.

6

of other nations or -

It didn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there -- is there -- I mean,

8

you're giving me the answer I thought the other side

9

would give me.

All right?

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I appreciate it actually.

You say that two-thirds of

12

these people, the customers, are American.

13

dealing with a business that is primarily American, not a

14

business like the Swiss ship except with the

15

cases.

16

because of structural changes we'll have to make.

17

changes?

18

have read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe

19

also have discrimination laws against disabled people, and

20

therefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr.

21

Goldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your

22

clients will have to make any significant structural

23

change that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.

So we're

exceptional

Then you say, all right, still it's a problem
What

That is to say, I would have thought I could

24

MR. FREDERICK:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's -Now, what's the response to

38
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, that's completely false.

3

In -- in the year 2000, the United States Government

4

issued a report that contained an extensive appendix,

5

which we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious

6

detail the conflicts between land-based ADA standards and

7

SOLAS.

8
9

Now, I can give you some specifics, if you would
-- that are fairly practical, such as the ADA requires

10

under the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that

11

there be a disabled access cabin on every level of the

12

ship, but SOLAS requires that passengers with disabilities

13

be placed near evacuation points.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why -- why can't you just

15

fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably

16

achievable?

17

you're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a -- a

18

disabled person double the price -

19

MR. FREDERICK:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Because in order to avoid that problem, what

As a matter of fact --- because they're a nuisance.

And that's your position.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Kennedy, as a matter of

23

fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination

24

here.

25

the -- the allegations are true, but they are

We're having to fight this on the basis of assuming

1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

categorically false.

2

And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it doesn't matter what

3

you want to do as a matter of good will.

4

what the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up

5

to us, we govern.

6

discrimination law.

7

The question is

You're not governed by U.S. anti

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Ginsburg, what the other

8

side wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in

9

which a district judge becomes the special master of the

10

cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that

11

would require some modification to the ship -

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That happens to every employer

13

under -- in the United States under the reasonably

14

achievable standard.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

And that's why, Justice Kennedy,

16

it's a question of congressional intent.

17

Congress debated extensively about whether to impose

18

design requirements on foreign ships in the Oil Pollution

19

Act of 1990, and it decided to buck the international

20

system knowingly by imposing a design requirement that

21

double hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil

22

tankers.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

The very same

Mr. Frederick, that brings up

24

a question I've been meaning to ask you.

25

was this whole problem of the application of this statute

To what extent

40
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative

2

history of these statutes?

3
4
5

MR. FREDERICK:

Zero.

There is not one word

about vessel JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

If -- if that's so

6

and if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I could

7

get out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court tries

8

to do what it really would have thought Congress would

9

have intended in the circumstances.

And if that's so, why

10

wouldn't Congress really have intended that a business

11

that's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Because it was encroaching on an

13

area of foreign sovereignty.

14

by foreign laws.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Foreign ships are governed

Does -- does Britain -- or does

16

Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid

17

you to charge this double price?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20
21

I don't Does European law -- I'd be

surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?
MR. FREDERICK:

I -- I don't know the answer to

22

European law on charging of an additional price, but I

23

would point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures,

24

do go to the structure of the vessel.

25

here fundamentally in the ADA about structural changes

And we're talking

41
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

that they want to impose that go -- when ships travel,

2

they can't dismantle those structural changes when they

3

leave U.S. waters.

4

JUSTICE STEVENS:

5

to you?

6

the statute apply or not?

7
8

Mr. -- may I ask this question

What about a -- an American-flagged ship?

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved

that question.

9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

10

MR. FREDERICK:

What is your view?
Our view is that there are

11

arguments that can be made that it does not because

12

Congress didn't -

13
14

JUSTICE STEVENS:
arguments can be made.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. FREDERICK:

18

What is your view?

Not what

What is your view?
Well, I think --

No.

I think our view is that it

doesn't.

19

JUSTICE STEVENS:

20

MR. FREDERICK:

It does not apply.
It does not apply because

21

Congress didn't express the intent.

22

JUSTICE STEVENS:

So really, we're not concerned

23

with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship.

24

concerned with the fact it's a ship.

25

Does

MR. FREDERICK:

You're

The -- there's a difference and

42
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

-- and there are about 1,000 U.S.-flagged ships that carry

2

passengers, so that if Congress had given any thought to

3

the question, it is reasonable to suppose it might have

4

distinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. law

5

directly governs and foreign ships that are governed by a

6

different law.

7

The fact -

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do we need -- do we need a

8

clear statement for United States ships?

9

case rested on a clear statement requirement.

10

I thought your
Is there

any clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, Justice Scalia.
So why -- why isn't there a

13

clear difference between the two?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

Because there aren't any words

15

in the statute that go to ships.

16

a catchall phrase at the end of bus, rail, and any other

17

means of conveyance.

18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's pretty good, isn't

it?

20

MR. FREDERICK:

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

The best they can do is

Well, it's not -

If you don't require a clear

statement, that's -- that's good enough, it seems to me.

24

MR. FREDERICK:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -Your -- your case hangs on the

43
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

fact that, you know, when Congress wants to -- to rule the

2

world and say all ships in the -- in the world that touch

3

at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so

4

clearly.

5

with respect to American ships.

6

It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity

MR. FREDERICK:

With respect to foreign ships,

7

there is a clear statement rule and that clear statement

8

rule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is

9

governed by the law of the flag state where it is

10

registered.

That's been the rule for 200 years.

11

And the other side's position -

12

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Well, is that limited,

13

though, just to things that affect the internal order of

14

the ship?

15

that rule?

16

Is that the context in which we've articulated

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, it's been articulated in

17

several different contexts.

18

case, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case

19

where the Court said that a patented device on the ship,

20

which was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an

21

American patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law.

22

And the Court said, because we can't conceive that

23

Congress would have imagined this general language to

24

encroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship.

25

In the Brown v. Duchesne

Now, the other side has exactly two sentences to

44
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

say about that case, but that is the case that is directly

2

on point because that case says that when you are dealing

3

with American laws that are generally written, you would

4

not ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless

5

Congress said so specifically.

6

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But -- but in that case, there

7

was -- as I understand it, there was no legal relationship

8

of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing

9

object and the ship in the United States.

So it at least

10

made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed

11

to external relationships arguably involving -- or

12

implicating American law.

13

situation here.

14

States with the foreign cruise line.

15

in your patent case.

16

You've got exactly the opposite

You've got contracts made in the United

MR. FREDERICK:

You didn't have that

Well, Justice Souter, you have a

17

foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a

18

foreign country under foreign engineering standards -

19
20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

With its principal place of

business in the United States.
MR. FREDERICK:

For a time before that ship

moves into another market.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG: But --

24

JUSTICE SOUTER:

25

But its significant external --

its significant commercial relationships are in the United

45
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

States with people in the United States performed

2

partially in the United States.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

In just the same way that

4

McCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course

5

of business that is regular between Honduras and the

6

United States is not going to be sufficient to apply -

7
8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The crew members were

Honduran in that case.

9

MR. FREDERICK:

10

They were.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This -- if you just look at

11

it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this

12

operation.

13

The passengers are from the USA.

14

in Florida.

15

that it flies which can legitimately govern the

16

relationship with its crew.

17

the relationship with passengers, it seems to me very

18

strange.

You'd say that's got USA written all over it.
The company is centered

And then you have this flag of convenience

But to say that it governs

19

And also the ticket says, passenger, if you're

20

going to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and

21

under U.S. law to boot.

22

MR. FREDERICK:

But a choice-of-law clause,

23

Justice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law

24

in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be

25

incorporated.

I'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause

46
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that -- that simply takes in every domestic statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Just -- it's just one other

3

indicia that one looks at this operation and says this

4

belongs to the USA.

5

come down there.

6

A practical judgment, I think, would

MR. FREDERICK:

And -- and you would have -

7

under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products

8

Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of

9

other statutes of general application that are now going

10

to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a

11

lot of business in the United States.

12

The problem here, as a matter of congressional

13

intent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this,

14

and because Congress -

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we -- we do -- we do

16

have the rule if it -- if it applies to the internal

17

operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is

18

concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may

19

well be governed by the law of the flag.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

And the internal operations of

21

the ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is

22

designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the

23

cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how -

24

everything about the ship's design -

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's a part of the case I'm

47
1111 14th Street, NW Suite 400

Alderson Reporting Company
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

not sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be

2

fought out under the reasonably achievable -

3

MR. FREDERICK:

It doesn't -- Justice Kennedy,

4

the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport

5

with the language of -- of the statute.

6

think in terms of -- as it did in the Oil Pollution Act,

7

it said, if there's a conflict with international law,

8

work it out.

9

and work out the conflict.

Congress didn't

Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations
It didn't put anything like

10

that in this statute, which is a further indication that

11

if Congress wants to extend this kind of disability

12

protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so

13

willingly.

14

And the Government has had 13 years to come up

15

with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best

16

they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in

17

this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft

18

guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships.

19

regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an

20

application to a large passenger cruise ship.

21

wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this

22

Court need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic

23

legislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has

24

not expressed the intent to do that.

1

Breyer's question about the number of foreign ships?

2

we get beyond cruise lines, does it -- would -- would the

3

-- the application on your view cover the -- the dozen

4

passengers who decide they want to take a trip on a -- on

5

a cargo boat?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Once

I don't perceive a

7

limiting principle to the other side's position.

8

there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or

9

two stops in the United States a year, and under their

10

In fact,

view, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well.

11

If -- if Congress wants to enact these limits,

12

it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex

13

area and ships are different from land-based

14

accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate

15

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may

Applying title III of the Americans With

15

Disabilities Act to foreign-flagged vessels would invite

16

precisely the sort of international discord, conflict, and

17

confusion that Congress presumably seeks to avoid when it

writes American laws.

clear that the Bahamian Government does and all of its

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm asking about the

application of U.S. law.

3

MR. GARRE:

We think that that question can be

4

resolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested,

5

which is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes

6

to the internal affairs of the ship -- and there -- we

7

would suggest that there is more central to the internal

8

affairs of the ship than its construction and design.

9

Under international law, article 94 of the Law of -- Law

10

of the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has

11

ratified -- and by the way, the United States has not, and

12

that's an important principle for this Court to keep in

13

mind -- foreign-flagged states may be bound by different

14

international treaties than the United States.

15

trying to draw some conflict resolution device that would

16

deal with treaties that the United States has entered

17

into, international nations have not will not address that

18

problem.

Rights Act of '64.

23

which you're operating.

There's -- you say, well, that's

With respect, Justice Ginsburg,

our principle is that when it comes to the matters that

by the flag state, then when Congress writes its laws, we

presume that unless Congress clearly indicates an

4

affirmative intention to address those matters, it did not

5

intend to.

7

repercussions of applying that law to foreign-flagged

vessels.

case, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to

If

10

a country like the United States extended its laws to

foreign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations

may well follow suit.

13

And if you take a simple hypothetical example,

14

the Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New

15

York, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has

adopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain

different structural and design requirements than the

draft guidelines that the United States have promulgated.

There are different requirements for door widths.

are different requirements for sloping.

MR. GARRE:

We would take the same approach that

2

this Court emphasized in -- in the McCulloch case, which

3

is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak

4

havoc for the question whether a significant regulation

5

like the ADA would apply to a vessel.

6

vessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they

7

have to undertake the extraordinary changes -

JUSTICE BREYER:
do.

How would foreign

The answer would be yes, you

You do have to, and then if there's some other

10

authority that wants to get involved in this, the two

11

authorities would work it out.

12

MR. GARRE:

Justice Breyer, the way that those

13

issues are worked out in the international shipping

14

context is through the International Maritime

15

Organization.

16

crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping

17

codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of

18

accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly.

19

We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief.

20

guidelines right now are -- are not binding guidelines,

21

but they could well become binding guidelines.

be viewed as not reasonably achievable.

to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with

American law, according to them.

5

MR. GARRE:

So all you have

Well, we don't think the readily

6

achievable language in the first case in any way

7

contemplates conflicts with international law.

8

has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country

9

that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with

10

international obligations or international laws, including

11

customary international law, as you wrote for the Court

12

last term in -- in the Empagran case.

13

American legislatures give respect to the interests of

14

sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't

assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign

16

interests of other nations.
