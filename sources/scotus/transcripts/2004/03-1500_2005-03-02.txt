We'll now hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN CHEMERINSKY
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

9

Stevens, and may it please the Court:

10

Good morning, Justice

On the grounds of the Texas State Capitol,

11

there is one evident religious symbol that conveys a

12

powerful religious message that there is a theistic

13

God and that God has committed rules for behavior.

14

Of course, the government may put

15

religious symbols on its property, including the Ten

16

Commandments, but must do so in a way that does not

17

endorse religion or a particular religion, but does

18

not have the purpose of advancing religion, but does

19

not favor any particular religion.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Chemerinsky, I

21

suppose that opening statement suggests that you

22

think that Thanksgiving proclamations are also

23

unconstitutional, which were recommended by the very

24

first Congress, the same Congress that proposed the

25

First Amendment.

MR. CHEMERINSKY:
- I'm sorry.

4

No, Your Honor, I would

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They also refer to one

God, to a theistic ruler of the universe.

5

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, I think

6

the Thanksgiving proclamations would be

7

constitutional.

8

legislative prayers that this Court upheld in

9

Chambers v. Marsh.

10

I think it's analogous to the

I think it's very different than

this Ten Commandments monument.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

But then you

12

have to narrow your opening statement and say that

13

certainly the State can acknowledge the existence of

14

a unitary God without offending the Establishment

15

Clause.

16

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, Your Honor, but it

17

all depends on how it is done.

18

it is done is the most powerful and profound

19

religious message that this Court has ever considered

20

on government property.

21

that proclaims not only there is a God, but God has

22

dictated rules for behavior for those who follow him

23

or her.

24
25

Here the way in which

Here you have a monument

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't know whether

that's any more profound or ultra-religious,

super-religious than the prayer that the chaplain

2

gives every day in the House.

3

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, there is a

4

difference between a prayer that a chaplain gives --

5

in Chambers v. Marsh, this Court emphasized that the

6

prayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer.

7

This is very much sectarian.

8

there is a God.

9

This proclaims that

It proclaims --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean, I haven't

10

read the prayer.

11

through all the prayers and there was no mention,

12

direct or indirect, of the Ten Commandments or a

13

couple of them.

14

So I would be surprised if I went

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, I would be

15

surprised because here, if you look at these

16

commandments, it's that God has claimed that he is

17

the only God, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting

18

graven images, prohibiting taking the name of the

19

Lord and God in vain.

20

sabbath.

21

rules for behavior.

22

Requiring observing of the

This is God dictating to God's followers

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is there any other -- I

23

mean, you can continue if you want, but one

24

difference which I've written down is you say that

25

the difference between this and the prayer is that

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

this is more profoundly religious.

2

other difference, in your opinion?

3
4

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No.

Is there any

I think the key

difference is --

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the difference?

6

So if I happen to read these prayers in the Congress

7

and I came to the conclusion that in terms of a

8

religious message, I actually thought the prayers had

9

the more religious message, then I should vote

10

against you.

11

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

There

12

are, of course, other differences.

13

Justice Scalia earlier, with regard to legislative

14

prayer in Chambers versus Marsh, this Court said that

15

there was a history going back to the very first

16

Congress that allowed there to be those kinds of

17

religious invocations.

18

standing by themselves, as they do here, certainly

19

are not of that historic origin.

20

As I said to

Ten Commandments monuments

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

How about if they're

21

packaged in a museum-like setting and there is some

22

interest on the part of the State in preserving

23

something.

24

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

25

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
And displaying a whole

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Of course, there can be

Ten Commandments or any religious works as part of a

museum setting.

5

This isn't a museum setting, Your

Is it a park-like setting?

Is this a kind of a

What do we regard this space as?

9

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

What is it?

It is a park-like

10

setting.

It is the acres of the State Capitol

11

grounds.

Every monument on the State Capitol grounds

12

is there because the State legislature wanted to

13

convey a particular message.

14

Texas, an impeachable offense to put anything on the

15

Capitol grounds without the approval of the

16

legislature.

17

It is a felony in

Most of the monuments are there to honor

18

war veterans.

19

anywhere on the Capitol grounds.

20

This is the only religious message

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

And by itself --

Well, would it be all

21

right, in your view, if they put several others up

22

for different religions?

23

okay?

24
25

Then is it going to be

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

If the clear purpose and

message was to honor the diversity of religions in

Quite the contrary.

This is exactly how the State may display the Ten

Commandments.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

proclamations don't do that.

what the framers and what our society for several

2

hundred years has believed the Establishment Clause

3

means.

4

And it does not -- it is not too sectarian

becomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten

Commandments.

1

religion.

2

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

Okay.

But if the

3

legislature itself can have its sessions opened with

4

a prayer, can the legislature itself want to have the

5

Ten Commandments posted within the legislative halls?

6
7

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Your Honor, I think

there is a very different message that's conveyed.

8

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

9

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Can it do that?
No, Your Honor, it can't

10

post the Ten Commandments by itself in its

11

legislative halls because that would then be the

12

government endorsing expression for support for that

13

message.

14

It cannot be, Your Honor, that just

15

because there is a legislative prayer, that any

16

religious message anywhere on government property

17

would then be permissible.

18

said in his opinion for --

19

As Justice Kennedy has

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But it's so hard to

20

draw that line.

21

sessions attended by the public with a prayer, you

22

say it cannot, in the same building, display the Ten

23

Commandments.

24
25

If the legislature can open its own

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

That's right, because

the message from the government is quite different.

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

The message with legislative prayers, as this Court

2

found in Chambers v. Marsh, is a recognition of a

3

long historical practice.

4

But when it comes to the Ten Commandments,

5

it really is different than even a legislative

6

prayer.

7

that God has proclaimed rules for behavior.

8

Commandments come from sacred texts.

This declares not only there is a God, but

9

The Ten

As Justice Kennedy said in his opinion of

10

County of Allegheny, certainly a city council could

11

not put atop the city hall building a large Latin

12

cross, even if that city council begins every day

13

with a prayer.

14

It cannot be there just because some

15

religious messages are allowed, like a prayer, that

16

everything then becomes permissible.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you know, in the

18

First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict.

19

A moment's delay in publication is a constitutional

20

crisis.

concern with any mention of religion.

I don't think so, Your

Honor.

14

makes some feel like insiders and some like

15

outsiders.

2

endorse the religious expression thereon.

3

Now, my question to you is, if there were

4

a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be

5

an adequate remedy, in your view?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

It would be a harder

case, but I don't think it would be an adequate

remedy.

And the reason is the city cannot put a

property just through disclaimer.

11

That's exactly what County of Allegheny

12

was.

14

can't excuse it because otherwise the city could put

15

the large Latin cross just with a disclaimer.

There the nativity scene in the courthouse had

JUSTICE STEVENS:

But if the test is

17

whether the reasonable observer would think that the

18

government is endorsing the religious message,

19

wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the

20

reasonable observer the government was not endorsing

21

the message?

22

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I think the disclaimer

23

would make it a harder case, but I think when you're

24

dealing with the ground in a Texas State Capitol and

25

the Texas Supreme Court, that placement, when you're

13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

dealing with the Ten Commandments, sacred texts, I

2

still think that the message the reasonable observer

3

would be that this is the government endorsing

4

religion.

5

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

At some point, would

6

the State's interest in preserving old objects

7

overcome the objection constitutionally?

8
9
10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

Yes, at some point, it

could where it was clear to the reasonable observer
that it was there because it was an old object.

11

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

How did this monument

12

get there?

13

in as a result of promoting a movie about the Ten

14

Commandments?

15

Was it in -- is it true that it was put

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

The record is unclear as

movie, The Ten Commandments, worked with the Friends

There are certainly many indications in the

6

that if you look at the entire monument, in addition

of Christ, there is also Jewish Stars of David.

9

I've tried to find out what that text is.

It is not in a script that anyone

And as I was saying in response to Justice

Kennedy's question, imagine the Muslim or the

government.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That person will see

I thought Muslims accept

the Ten Commandments.
MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor, the

18

Muslims do not accept the sacred nature of the Ten

19

Commandments, nor do Hindus, or those who believe in

20

many gods, nor of course, do atheists.

21

And for that matter, Your Honor, if a

22

Jewish individual would walk by this Ten

23

Commandments, and see that the first commandment

24

isn't the Jewish version, I am the Lord, thy God,

25

took you out of Egypt, out of slavery, would realize

it's not his or her government either.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You know, I think

3

probably 90 percent of the American people believe in

4

the Ten Commandments, and I'll bet you that 85

5

percent of them couldn't tell you what the ten are.

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And when somebody goes by

8

that monument, I don't think they're studying each

9

one of the commandments.

It's a symbol of the fact

10

that government comes -- derives its authority from

11

God.

12

symbol to be on State grounds.

13

And that is, it seems to me, an appropriate

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I disagree, Your Honor.

14

For the State to put that symbol between its State

15

Capitol and the State Supreme Court is to convey a

16

profound religious message.

17

now, this isn't there for its secular reason.

18

someone were to read this monument, one sees that it

19

emphasizes its religious content.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you're just saying,
If

It is a profound

21

religious message, but it's a profound religious

22

message believed in by the vast majority of the

23

American people, just as belief in monotheism is

24

shared by a vast majority of the American people.

25

And our traditions show that there is

nothing wrong with the government reflecting that.

2

mean, we're a tolerant society religiously, but just

3

as the majority has to be tolerant of minority views

4

in matters of religion, it seems to me the minority

has to be tolerant of the majority's ability to

express its belief that government comes from God,

which is what this is about.

I

As Justice Kennedy said, turn your eyes
away if it's such a big deal to you.

10

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

I disagree, Your Honor.

11

Because this Court has said that above all, the

12

government can't make some feel like they're insiders

13

and some like outsiders.

14

majority religion --

15

Even if they're the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose a

16

non-Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who

17

has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious

18

person.

19

require that we pretend that there is no religious

20

motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part

21

of many of our public officials seems to me to be a

22

hostility toward religion.

23

Does he feel like an outsider?

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

And to

No, Your Honor.

Imagine

24

that judge put the Ten Commandments right above his

or her bench.

1

like outsiders.

2

religious beliefs, but they can't have the religious

3

beliefs above them.

4

Of course, many judges have

And Your Honor, that's not hostility to

5

religion.

6

excluding religious symbols like the nativity scene,

7

when displayed by itself, is not hostility to

8

religion.

9

As this Court said in County of Allegheny,

Last year in Locke v. Davie, this Court

10

said that to deny funding through the State of

11

Washington for scholarships was not hostility to

12

religion.

13

about hostility to religion.

14

that every person who walks into that courtroom can

15

feel that it's his or her government.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Enforcing the Establishment Clause is not
It is about making sure

That's an important point

17

to me, but I don't see any way to get there in these

18

difficult cases without making a practical judgment

19

about whether that's really so.

20

And the reason I say that, I start with

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

that it's there for secular purposes.

nothing that would lend the reasonable observer to

I think that would still

be unconstitutional between the Texas State Capitol

and the Texas Supreme Court because it would still be

the State of Texas expressing the message that there

is a God and that God has dictated these rules for

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Okay, what if you go one

step further and there was simply a tablet without

any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou

If the tablets were by

themselves in that way, between the Texas Supreme

harder case, but I believe it would still be

unconstitutional because those tablets do convey a

objection simply because though it does not say so, those

were quotations from the last six commandments

If all

it said was thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who are you kidding?

I

20

mean, everybody knows that comes from the Ten

21

Commandments.

22

these commands that are engraved on the human heart

23

come from God.

24

instead of that, just quote the State statute against

murder.

And what that message says is that

us that the State cannot accommodate religion.

20

way they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up

21

and insist that it's always secular, whether it's

predominantly for a secular purpose.

that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people

to surrender their beliefs and that is not

MR. CHEMERINSKY:

No, Your Honor.

I do

2

think that it degrades religion to have to have the

3

Ten Commandments defended for their secular purpose.

4

I do think, though, that what's required of the

5

government, when it puts religious symbols on

6

government property, is to not be endorsing religion.

7

That's why a nativity scene by itself in the County

8

of Allegheny case was unconstitutional.

9

On the other hand, that's why the nativity

scene as part of a unified display in Lynch v.

11

Donnelly was permissible.

12

the reasonable observer would see, it is permissible.

That's why, if the Ten

please the Court:

2

Every court that has reviewed the specific

3

facts of this case has agreed that the Texas monument

4

is constitutional under this Court's well settled

5

precedents in Lynch and Allegheny.

6

agree that the Texas monument should not be torn down

7

from its historical place for three reasons.

8

First, the Ten Commandments is an

9

historically recognized symbol of law.

Second, this

10

monument is one of the smallest of the 17 monuments

11

on the Capitol grounds, and like most of the other

12

monuments, was a gift to the State of Texas and is

13

clearly recognized as such on the monument itself.

14

And third, this monument has stood for

15

more than 40 years without controversy on a national

16

historic landmark.

17

In fact, even the --

Under your analysis of the reason this is

I'm wondering what your view is.

And maybe that's the correct result.

GEN. ABBOTT:

I seriously question whether

5

or not a crucifix would be constitutionally

6

acceptable in that same location, and for the very

7

same reasons which I'm articulating why the Ten

8

Commandments would be acceptable in this location.

The crucifix is not like the Ten

10

Commandments in that it's not an historically

11

recognized symbol of law.

message to all the people, regardless of whether or not they

13

are believers or not believers of the important role

14

the Ten Commandments have played in the development

15

of law.

It doesn't send a secular

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not a secular

17

message.

18

that the only reason it's okay is it sends nothing

think the message it sends is that law is -- and our

institutions come from God.

And if you don't think it conveys that
message, I just think you're kidding yourself.

Ten Commandments send both a religious message and a

When people --

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

But the district court,

3

I think in this very case, found that commemorating

the Ten Commandments' role in the development of

secular law was not one of the State's purposes in

accepting the monument.

Now, will you accept that finding as the

case comes to us?

don't have any cross appeal.

10

We

11

GEN. ABBOTT:

The Court obviously is

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So in another case, if a

government official feels that the Ten Commandments

3

have been very, very important in his or her life as

a spiritual or religious matter and wants other

people to know how important the Ten Commandments

are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten

10

And so you can have no Ten

purpose that is the most manifest value of these

symbols.

16

You're asking us to ignore the religious

GEN. ABBOTT:

purpose and effect in this particular setting, I

don't think that religion was the driving force.

19

know that all of the evidence shows that religion was

20

not a driving force in any respect.

21

JUSTICE O'CONNOR:

I

I suppose that every

22

monument that's on the State Capitol grounds in Texas

23

in a sense conveys a message of State endorsement,

24

State endorsement of the role of servicemen in

25

fighting earlier wars or in support of the Boy Scouts

31
Alderson Reporting Company

1

or whatever it might be, doesn't it?

2

I mean, by placing them there with the

3

legislative approval, is that not really some kind of

4

a message of endorsement for each one?

5

GEN. ABBOTT:

If I may clarify an

6

important fact and that is clearly the State of

7

Texas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum-like

8

setting on the Capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge

9

and commemorate certain events.

10

It's important for the Court to remember,

11

though, that the State of Texas has specifically

12

endorsed nine of those monuments by putting the State

13

seal or the Lone Star seal for the State of Texas on

14

those nine monuments.

15

that kind of endorsement on there.

16

This monument does not have

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Isn't it all the case, as

17

has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be

approval of the legislature?

20

do you?

21
22
23

GEN. ABBOTT:

You don't dispute that,

Not at all.

That is very

true.
JUSTICE SOUTER:

And you don't dispute

24

that anyone going on those grounds would assume that

25

the State government approved it or it wouldn't be

2

GEN. ABBOTT:

Justice Souter, of course

3

the presumption would be that people on the Capitol

4

grounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those

5

monuments on the Capitol grounds.

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I'm not sure that

7

that endorsement -- in England, there is a square

8

where they have King Charles on one hand -- on one

9

end and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded

10

him, on the other.

11

12

I don't know if you have to

GEN. ABBOTT:

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

13

believe that there is a very meaningful difference

14

between this Court's standards of an endorsement and

15

what a State or the nation may do with regard to

16

commemoration.

17

As an easy example, on the National Mall,

18

there is, of course, the Lincoln Memorial and in the

19

Lincoln Memorial, there is text from the King James

20

version of the Bible.

21

acknowledges Lincoln and what he has said.

endorse the King James version of the Bible or a

particular religious message in that.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But you have to contend

2

with the fact that the district court found that this

3

sort of commemoration of the Commandments involved

4

was not the objective in placing the monument there,

5

so you're left basically with a religious text.

6

And if anybody has any doubt about that,

7

the religious text is surrounded by some religious

8

symbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David.

9

to me that it's hard to find, if we accept the

So it seems

10

district court findings, that there's anything here

11

but an expression of approval by the State of Texas

12

for a religious expression, and only for the

13

religious expression.

14

GEN. ABBOTT:

Sir, all other factors, though,

15

Justice Souter, as a person who stands in front of

16

that monument clearly recognizes, centered in a

specialized scroll is an indication that this was a

people and the youth of the State of Texas by the

the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very

8

far, does it?

very meaningful difference between acknowledging

something and endorsing something.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

Maybe it doesn't, but I'm

5

trying to find a rationale for the argument that's

6

being made, and that I thought you were alluding to.

7

The argument is that by mixing this in

with a grab bag of other symbols, you have somehow

diluted or changed the focus from a religious message

to something else.

JUSTICE SOUTER:

But what do you do with

the district court finding?
GEN. ABBOTT:

Well, the district court

finding obviously chose to decide that the secular

purpose for the display was to honor the Fraternal

7

Order of Eagles for their commitment to combating

8

juvenile delinquency.

9

But that is different -- the purpose why

the district court found why the display was

constitutional is different than the message that is

being sent to the reasonable observer.

The second point is that

JUSTICE STEVENS:

General Abbott, would

the Texas purpose be equally served if the monument

had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in

4

Wisconsin put on its monument?

5
6
7

GEN. ABBOTT:

Justice Stevens, I

apologize, I'm not familiar with that disclaimer.
JUSTICE STEVENS:

It reads this way.

What

8

they did is they sold the parcel of land that had the

9

Eagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and then

10

they put a fence around it and then they put this

11

sign up, "This property is not owned or maintained by

12

the City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse the

13

religious expression thereon."

14

still on the property, it couldn't be the same.

15

Maybe as long as it's

But suppose you had a comparable

16

disclaimer.

17

which you relied to justify having the statue there?

18

Would that defeat any of the purposes on

A disclaimer like that would

surely ensure that this display is constitutional.

has decided Establishment Clause cases on a

10

case-by-case basis, but in this particular instance,

11

the Ten Commandments displayed in a museum-like

12

setting on the Capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other

monuments, the message that is received by the viewer

who is trekking through the Capitol grounds looking

JUSTICE BREYER:

I've got to get one

18

question before you leave because you're the one who

knows the record.

20

finding in the record is what I think there must be

21

some material that the State or somebody in a tourist

22

office or a guide or somebody tells people what the

23

17 different monuments are.

24
25

And what I've had a hard time

And all I've found is the general brochure
which doesn't tell them what they are.

And I found

This thing, it says grounds?

GEN. ABBOTT:

Your Honor, Justice Breyer,

13

if I could refer you to page 205 of the Joint

14

Appendix, it provides a description of each of the

15

monuments on the walking tour.

16

refer the Court to page 117 of the Joint Appendix, it

17

shows the actual walking tour where a person would go

18

along the process of seeing the monuments.

19

And if I could also

But clearly as they walk through the

20

Capitol grounds, what any observer, not just the

21

reasonable observer, what any observer would notice

22

is that before they could even get to this particular

23

monument, they will have passed in full view of

24

countless other monuments and historical markers

25

clearly indicating to them that they are not there

Alderson Reporting Company

for the purpose of seeing just the Ten Commandments

2

but they are in a museum-like setting cast among many

3

different kinds of monuments.

4
5

And so they appreciate the setting before
they even arrive at the Ten Commandments monument.

6

Also when they arrive at the Ten

7

Commandments monument, they will notice it is one of

8

the smallest of the monuments on the Texas Capitol

9

grounds.

It does have the disclaimer on it

10

indicating that it was donated by the Fraternal Order

11

of Eagles.

It does not have the State seal on it

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

other monuments?

actually not clear from the record.

you mean just this Texas case or other cases

2

involving an Eagles Ten Commandments?

3

GEN. ABBOTT:

Justice Ginsburg, my

considered the specific -- every court that has

6

considered the specific facts of this case, meaning

7

the Texas case --

8
9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you didn't mean this

particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?
GEN. ABBOTT:

No, Your Honor.

What I

11

meant is that both the district court and the Fifth

12

Circuit Court of Appeals specifically reviewed the

13

facts of this case and were all in complete agreement

14

that the facts of this case render this monument

15

constitutional under this Court's well settled

16

precedents in Lynch and Allegheny.

17

One other thing I would like to draw the

18

Court's attention to that will give you a very well

19

understanding of what the monument looks like and its

20

setting is the videotape that is Exhibit 44, it's

21

obviously not part of the Joint Appendix, but it

22

demonstrates how this particular monument is set in a

museum-like setting amongst many other monuments and

gives you the perspective of what the typical viewer

would appreciate as they walk around the Capitol

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

13
14
15
16

Mr. Clement.

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENTS
MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, and may it

please the Court:
The Ten Commandments have undeniable

17

religious significance, but they also have secular

18

significance as a code of law and as a

19

well-recognized historical symbol of the law.

20

State decides to display a Ten Commandments display

21

along with more than a dozen other monuments on its

22

Capitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is

23

not endorsing the religious text of the Ten

24

Commandments.

25

When a

And in the same way, when a state has that

45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

monument as part of such a collection, the

2

Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to

3

force them to send a message of hostility to religion

4

by singling out that one monument for removal solely

5

because of its religious content.

6

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Mr. Clement, can I ask you to address

7

one thing that troubles me about the case?

8

understand it, it's the Protestant version basically

9

of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has

As I

10

significant differences from the Catholic version and

11

the Jewish version.

12

And I understand it was the result of

13

consultation and so forth.

14

brief, you list the States in which the Ten

15

Commandments displays are listed, there is none for

16

Rhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a

17

Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts

18

is a frieze on the north wall of the public library

19

which apparently didn't have the text of the

20

commandments in it.

21

But I noticed in your

Is there any significance to the fact that

22

this kind of display may be more popular in areas of

23

the country where the Protestant religion is dominant

24

as opposed to other versions of Christian religions?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Stevens, I don't

46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

think so.

2

exhaustive survey, but I think there is a

3

well-represented group of displays throughout the

4

country including, I think, in States that probably

5

have relatively high Catholic populations.

6

I mean, we didn't purport to do an

But I think we would steer this Court away

7

from attributing too much significance to the fact

8

that if a State is going to display the Ten

9

Commandments at all, it will necessarily have to

10

display a version that reflects one or another sect's

11

preferences.

12

I mean, in the Marsh case, for example, this Court

13

upheld legislative prayer.

14

would necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that

15

chaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or

16

another.

17

practice of legislative prayer because of the

18

necessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination

19

or another.

It understood that they

And this Court didn't doom the whole

20

In fact, in the Marsh case itself, this

21

court upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they

22

had chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 16

23

straight years.

24

other Establishment Clause contexts has steered away

25

from putting the States and municipalities in a

And so I don't think this Court in

47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

catch-22.
And given that this Court has suggested

3

even in Stone against Graham that the Ten

4

Commandments can be displayed, can be used in certain

5

settings, it can't be that once the State in practice

6

picks a particular version, it's all of a sudden

7

guilty of a sectarian preference.

8
9

JUSTICE STEVENS:

Of course, the other

thing that was notable about your listing is most of

10

the examples are examples of displays of the event

11

itself rather than the text.

12

argument made I think by Professor Laycock that when

13

you display the entire text, it's kind of a different

14

sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic

15

presentation.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

And there is an

Well, Justice Stevens, I

17

think there are quite a few of both types of displays and

18

I think the very fact that the Fraternal Order of Eagles

19

put a lot of these displays out suggests that a bunch of

20

them are textual displays.

21

I'm not sure, though, that a display that

22

actually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments

23

from God is any less religious.

24

that's actually more religious than one that just

25

displays the monument standing alone.

I would suggest

Alderson Reporting Company

1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

If the monuments are standing alone, you

2

can I think appreciate the fact that maybe they're

3

being displayed for their secular significance as

4

well as their religious significance.

5

there, it's hard to avoid the implication that they

6

are the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a

7

secular code.

8

When Moses is

So in that sense, I'm not sure that the

9

variations in the display --

10

JUSTICE STEVENS:

You think just a symbolic

11

display is less objectionable than quoting the text as

12

this monument does?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Stevens, I

14

would say -- my point is not that there are not other

15

ways to display it.

16

out in our brief, blank tablets or tablets with Roman

17

numerals are less objectionable -- certainly, I don't think

18

they're beyond objection -- than a textual display.

19

My point was that I'm not quite sure how

I mean, certainly I think, as we point

20

one would balance sort of four Commandments and Moses

21

versus all Ten Commandments in text.

22

close call.

23

JUSTICE STEVENS:

I think it's a

Well, except the four

24

Commandments and Moses would avoid the differences

25

between the three different versions of the Ten

49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must

2

select one over the other two.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I guess I'm not sure

4

that's true.

5

out there in courthouses have Moses receiving the

6

Commandments and have text.

7

though, would be, again --

I mean, some of the displays that are

8

JUSTICE STEVENS:

9

MR. CLEMENT:

And I guess, my point,

Most of them don't.

To be sure, to be sure.

But

10

I would hope the constitutional line wouldn't be that

11

you can't have text.

12

have a role in our society and had an influence on

13

the development of the law as text.

14
15

I mean, the Ten Commandments

I mean, you know, they weren't influential with ten
Roman numbers.

16

They were influential as text.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Clement, there

17

is a question I have about the government's position.

18

And does place matter at all?

19

talking about the grounds surrounding a State

20

Capitol.

21

choice of the school board?

22

make -- or every courtroom up to the court to decide

for itself?

24
25

I mean, here we're

What about every school room, if that's the

MR. CLEMENT:

Is it the same or do you

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I

certainly think location and context matters.

I

Alderson Reporting Company

1

think in almost every Establishment Clause context,

2

the setting and context matters a great deal.

3

school case, for example, as you suggest, I mean,

4

unless this Court is going to revisit Stone against

5

Graham, it's certainly true that the school context

6

at least raises much more difficult questions.

7

The

In terms of where it can be displayed in

8

a courthouse, I think there are certainly

9

permissible displays in the courthouse, but it may be

10

something all together different to have a display in

11

a way that it actually looks like a religious

12

sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It looks just like this

14

monument.

15

rotunda of the court because the judges of that court

16

choose to have it there.

17

Let's take this monument and put it in the

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that all right?
Justice Ginsburg, I think

18

putting it in the rotunda of the court as a

19

stand-alone monument, giving it sort of pride of

20

place, if you will, raises a much more difficult

21

question, to be sure, and may well cross the

22

constitutional line.

23

As I was alluding to, the one case I'm

24

familiar with, which is the case of the Alabama

25

Supreme Court, there it was displayed in a way that

51
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street, NW, Suite 400
1-800-FOR-DEPO

Washington, DC 20005

1

the district court literally found it was like a

2

religious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And do you think that it

4

should cross the constitutional line under the

5

interpretational theory of the First Amendment you

6

wish us to adopt?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

I think the display that I

8

have in mind in the Alabama Supreme Court probably

9

does cross the constitutional line even under our

10

view.

11

in some appropriate way in the courthouse certainly

12

wouldn't cross the line that this Court -- that we

13

would have this Court draw.

14

I think that a display of the Ten Commandments

I mean, we think, for example, it cannot

15

be that the very fact that moving it closer to the

16

courthouse itself is a constitutional problem because

17

as you yourself have pointed out, Justice Kennedy,

18

the legislative prayers that were approved in Marsh

19

v. Chambers were at the absolute epicenter of the

20

government.

21

acknowledgment of religion.

22

And still those were a permissible

So I think while context matters, I don't

23

think solely the fact that it's moved closer to the

24

seat of government does have a dispositive impact.

25

And again, I would say in response to

to remember that there is going to have to be a

to be displayed at all.

Well, Justice Stevens, two

points to make about that.

disclaimer would make this an easier case.

14

would point out that there is a disclaimer of sorts

15

on the monument already because it clearly states

16

that it was a gift from the Fraternal Order of

17

Eagles.

One is certainly a

I think the idea that there has to be a

that the State has nothing to do with the Ten

One other point I think that is important

11

to put on the table, and it is consistent with the

12

analysis of both the district court and the Fifth

13

Circuit, is that whatever the original purpose is for

14

Texas accepting the monument and displaying it in the

15

first instance, they now have an additional secular

16

purpose in retaining the monument.

maintaining that document and maintaining the plaque

dilemma.
