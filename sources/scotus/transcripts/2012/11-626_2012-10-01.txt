Mr. Fisher.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
To be a vessel, a structure must be

12

practically capable of maritime transportation, and this

13

case turns on how to assess such practical capability.

14

And that's a question this Court answered

15

over a century ago in Cope and Perry, explaining that

16

practical capability depends not on any physical

17

attribute the structure might have, but rather, on "its

18

purpose," that is, whether its function is to move

19

people or things across water.

20

And that test has been applied numerous

21

times before and since, across decades, providing

22

stability and overall coherence to general maritime law.

23

And of course --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

test that way then, because it really --

You should have phrased the

1

MR. FISHER:

Pardon me?

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That doesn't seem to me a

3

very felicitous description of what -- of what the test

4

is -- is enunciated to be.

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7
8
9

Well, I think -The test is whether it's,

what, practically able?
MR. FISHER:

Practically capable.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Practically capable.

Well,

10

you could be practically capable of doing something,

11

even though the purpose of -- of setting the thing up

12

has nothing to do with that.

13
14
15

MR. FISHER:

Well, that's not what this

Court -- case is saying -JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand.

I'm just

16

saying we ought to get a different test, and let's --

17

let's get rid of this.

18

rid of this practically capable test, because

19

practically capable, frankly, would make us come out the

20

other way in this case.

21

MR. FISHER:

If we agree with you, let's get

With all due respect, I don't

22

think that's correct.

In Evansville in 1926, this Court

23

used that exact phrase, practical capability.

24

assessed that practical capability by looking at "the

25

function of the structure."
4
Alderson Reporting Company

And it

Official

1

Again and again, in Evansville and other

2

cases, this Court asked, was the function of the

3

structure to carry people or things across water.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

has -- I understand that argument.

6

connection whatever to the statutory language, right?

7

MR. FISHER:

Well, that just
It's got no

Well, I think the word capable

8

obviously is in the statute.

9

as recently as Stewart is that capable -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10
11

And what this Court said

Capable is in the

statute, purpose is not, right?

12

MR. FISHER:

Correct.

13

And what this Court said in Stewart is that

14

capable means practically capable, not theoretically

15

capable.

16

can be.

17

There's a range of how broad the word capable

And again, going back over a century, every

18

single time this Court's been confronted with that

19

question, it's used the term function to describe

20

whether or not something is practically capable of

21

carrying people or things over water.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you described

23

cases with this purpose -- or function, the briefs cited

24

the district court decision, Sea Village Marina, that

25

says floating homes like the one here that can be towed
5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and are not in the business of carrying people or goods,

2

but can be towed miles across the water, that those

3

constitute vessels.

4

And this district court decision,

5

Sea Village Marina, cited many, many cases.

6

that that district judge got it wrong, or the cases were

7

wrong?

8
9

MR. FISHER:

And you say

Justice Ginsburg, I think

there's a confusion of terminology that I hope I can --

10

that I hope I can straighten out at the outset.

11

The term floating home is generally

12

described to mean a residence that is designed to sit

13

still and is not designed to carry people or things over

14

water.
The term houseboat is something that is

15
16

self-propelled, generally moves people or things over

17

water.

18

What happened in the Sea Village Marina

19

case, to my understanding, is the Court simply used the

20

wrong term.

21

houseboats, as we describe a houseboat as something that

22

is designed to move its owner and the owner's things

23

from here to there, are vessels.

24

that.

25

It cited a lot of cases that held that

And we don't dispute

But on the other hand, you have something

Alderson Reporting Company

1

called floating homes, which the brief filed by the

2

Seattle and Sausalito floating homes associations give a

3

very thorough description of what a floating home is and

4

how it's different.

5

And a primary way that it's different is

6

that, as opposed to a houseboat, which is doing its

7

function, it's doing its job when it's moving things

8

from place to place, a floating home can't function when

9

it's out in the water being towed.

None of the

10

utilities work, none of the power, no equipment is

11

aboard to do anything --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but in -- in your

13

brief, I really lost count, but I think it's six times

14

on the first two pages, you talk about indefinitely

15

moored.

16

Now, the facts are in dispute, and we're not

17

quite clear of the facts, but let's assume that this

18

magnificent structure is -- which was mercifully

19

destroyed -- let's assume that it was attached to the

20

dock by a rope, a garden hose and an extension cord, and

21

that it could leave within 30 minutes notice.

22

indefinitely moored?

23

because of subjective intent of the owner?

24
25

And if the answer is yes, is that

indefinitely moored.

Is that

MR. FISHER:

It would still not be a vessel.

18

And you don't have to look any further than this Court's

19

Evansville case.

20
21
22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That would be indefinitely

moored, in your view?
MR. FISHER:

Well, I'm not sure if you'd use

23

the term indefinitely moored at that point, but it

24

certainly wouldn't be transformed into a vessel because

25

look at this Court's Evansville case.

MR. FISHER:

10

It doesn't seem to me to

start with something that is a vessel; the fact that you

simply leave it at the dock for a long time doesn't take

In the Evansville's case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does it -- does the permanent status or

thing, this floating home, do.

22

MR. FISHER:

Exactly.

And I'm doing -- if I

23

can just say this directly, I'm trying to do exactly

24

what this Court did in Cope and Evansville and Roper.

25

The exact analysis this Court applied in those cases is

precisely what we want this Court to apply here.

2

think what we're --

meaning of all -- of the word vessel as used in the

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

Correct.
What -- what meaning of

vessel in the United States Code is at issue here?

MR. FISHER:

14

Lien Act, which is what provides the Federal forum,

15

assertedly, for the plaintiff, the City, to bring this

16

case.

17

and substantive hook.

So the word vessel is -- is its jurisdictional

Justice Sotomayor, if I can return to your

19

question about indefinite mooring, the importance of

20

indefinite mooring in this case, where you have

21

something that was not a vessel to begin with, is simply

22

to ask whether it's been transformed into a vessel,

23

exactly as this Court asked in Roper.

24

used for its function for which it was created and --

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
12
Alderson Reporting Company

So is it being

Aren't you just

Official

1

begging the question?

You keep saying it was not a

2

vessel to begin with.

Why -- doesn't it just restate

3

the question?

4

MR. FISHER:

I'm not trying to beg the

5

question; I'm just trying to describe our argument to

6

you.

7
8
9

There are some cases where -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, doesn't your

argument beg the question?
MR. FISHER:

I hope not.

I'm trying to

10

distinguish between two lines of cases, one being where

11

you have things that were -- like the Roper case, that

12

were made as boats, as vessels undisputedly, and now the

13

question is whether they've been pulled out of

14

navigation; as opposed to another set of cases, which we

15

believe this falls into, where the question itself is

16

whether this was ever a vessel.

17

cases, the indefinite mooring shows that it's being used

18

for its function.

19

In those kinds of

It hasn't -- for example, if I could give a

hypothetical, maybe it would help, imagine a piece of

22

vessel because you can unhook the dock, load it up with

23

stuff and tow it around, if a company wanted to use that

24

as a makeshift barge.

25

Now, under their test, that would be a

But no maritime case has ever held that a
13
Alderson Reporting Company

2

then it would no longer be indefinitely moored and would

3

be using a different function and might be transformed

4

into a --

5

But if somebody did that,

I think you may -- you may

6

very well have a good argument, but if you're relying

7

either on purpose or on indefinite mooring, then you've

strange words, because they come out of our opinions --

MR. FISHER:

No, this Court in Stewart

12

rejected the snapshot test that I think is what you just

described.

14

The question is whether what -- whether it

15

has the function of moving people and things over water

16

or not.

17

Now, some casinos go up and down the river -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but I'm just

18

-- the hypothetical -- the hypothetical I've posed was

19

meant to pose the question, well, sometimes things do

20

both, and how do we tell which it is --

21

MR. FISHER:

If it actually does the latter

22

and is performing its function while moving, then it is

23

a vessel.

24

There's not a primary purpose test.

25

If one of its purposes is to move people or

But that's not

JUSTICE KAGAN:
Fisher?

How do we know that, Mr.

I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a

10

poor man's houseboat, right?

11

a floating home is actually to have a home that you can

12

hook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so

13

you don't have to, you know, have the motor running all

14

the time or have the capacity to move it all the time,

15

but when you want to move it on water and when you want

16

to move your possessions on water, you have the capacity

17

to do so.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON,

5

FOR UNITED STATES,

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. GANNON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

9

I think if I could start with Justice

10

Kagan's questions, the government's position is that

11

this is an objective function test and in evaluating

12

when a structure is practically capable of being used as

13

a means of transportation this Court has repeatedly

14

recognized that function is important to that inquiry.
It did so as recently as Stewart, when it

15
16

recognized that the function of the dredge there was to

17

carry crew and equipment across Boston Harbor in the

18

course of dredging a trench.

19

It also did so in the cases that

20

Petitioner's counsel has already talked about,

21

Evansville, Roper --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can I -- can I

23

interrupt you just there on the dredging?

You say the

24

function of the dredge was to carry people and

25

equipment.

I would have said the function of the -- the
20

dredge is to dredge in the middle of the river.

2

MR. GANNON:

Well, the Court --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right?

And so --

4

and I don't know which of us would be right, so it seems

5

to me that that function test is a very difficult one to

6

apply.

7

MR. GANNON:

Well, the Court in Stewart said

8

that "dredges" -- and I'm quoting from page 492 --

9

"serve a waterborne transportation function, because

10

they carry crew and equipment across" --

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I know what it

12

said.

I guess I would say, obviously, it serves a

13

waterborne function, but I'm not sure the first thing I

14

would say when I see one of these dredges in the middle

15

of the river is its purpose is to move people and

16

equipment.

17

I would say its purpose is to dredge.
MR. GANNON:

Well, but in general, it needs

18

to dredge not just in one place, because it's not just

19

dredging a hole, it's dredging a trench.

20

needs to move in order to do that.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It usually

No, I know but

22

that's saying that it has to be able to move, and I

23

agree with that.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose someone builds a

replica of an historic watercraft, a Viking boat, the

9

whatsoever of ever putting it in the water, but it's

10

built so that if they did, it would -- it would function

11

12

MR. GANNON:

I think that that would be a

13

vessel, because it really -- its objective function, if

14

you look at its design and its natural function --

15

that's just the phrase that the -- even Respondent's law

That's true.

That's because

it's no -JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. GANNON:

It is true that the Court

recognized in Stewart and the Coast Guard's craft

14

presumption that something that used to be a vessel can

15

cease to be a vessel if it is semi-permanently or

saying that this once was a vessel and it is now no

a somewhat easy case, because the hull, I think, was

22

23

MR. GANNON:

Well, there were things that

24

had been removed when it had been decommissioned

25

originally.

But if the court of appeals test were used
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

here and the court were to conclude that something is a

2

vessel, if it is merely capable of being towed across

3

water even to its detriment, then you can't explain the

4

answer in cases like Evansville or in Roper where --

5

because the Evansville wharf boat was towed at least ten

6

times, as described in pages 21 and 22 of the Court's

7

opinion, and nobody was asking whether it had all

8

the office furniture and light fixtures and things like

9

that removed when it was towed at least twice a year for

10

the seven years before that suit began.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Gannon, you think

12

that even at the moment that the thing is being

13

transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know,

14

various furniture and things on it, you think even at

15

that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not

be a vessel?

That's generally going to be

true, yes.

20

operate, just to be stationary beside the dock, then

21

it's not going to be a vessel even when it's being towed

how it needs to be lit at night and things like that,

24

but --

If the purpose of the structure, the

1

seaworthy so that it could be towed 200 miles without

2

suffering any damage, even if there are, you know, small

3

waves, let's say?

4

And the reason why it was built that way was

5

so that when the person moves the person wouldn't have

6

to hire a moving company to come with a van and take out

7

all the person's personal belongings and ship those

8

by -- by land.

9

moving all the stuff that's in it without having

This -- this is capable of moving and

10

anything damaged.

11

the result there?

12

Would it be the same?

MR. GANNON:

What would be

Well, I -- I understand the

13

point.

I think that, under a case like Evansville, that

14

there does seem to be a difference between relocating

15

the structure and using the structure to transport

16

people and things.

17

But under an objective function test, if it

18

really is designed to be mobile, and we look at it and

19

we say it really looks like a boat and it's designed to

20

move through water efficiently, it would probably look

21

different from this particular craft.

22

But if ultimate mobility is part of the

23

function of it, then -- then the answer could well be

24

different.

25

But, for the most part, I think my answer is
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the same as I was trying to give to Justice Kagan, which

2

is that this is either going to be a vessel all the time

3

until it becomes so permanently moored that it should no

4

longer be deemed a vessel.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

I really just don't

6

understand your answer.

Mobility surely was a -- was a

7

purpose of this because it was moved.

8

MR. GANNON:

9

JUSTICE ALITO:
MR. GANNON:

It can be moved.

There is a question about

Well, that's

something different.

14

MR. GANNON:

And before, you were asking

about the hook in the statute here.

16

the word contrivance does indicate that it's something

17

that has a function that's determinable.

We do think that

inquiry.

MR. FREDERICK:

we could imagine all kinds of de minimis types of

hypotheticals that would satisfy the basic criteria.

5

But what the Court in Stewart said was practical

6

capability as viewed in a real world sense.

7

aware of any case -- and they've certainly not pointed

8

to anything -- that identifies anything with those kind

9

of practical attributes that would be subject to

litigation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, practical

12

capability viewed in a real-world sense -- and you're

13

about transportation -- you're talking about things that

14

were built for transportation, right?

15

MR. FREDERICK:

You're -- yes.

You're --

16

that is true in the sense that one of the purposes, as

17

manifested through its physical characteristics, is the

18

ability to be moved across water.

19

And just as Mr. Lozman's houseboat here was

20

moved 200 miles in the first towage after the hurricane

21

wiped out every other vessel in the docks in the north

22

bay marina, and he had it towed with a speed boat

23

70 miles to the city of Riviera Beach, those physical

24

characteristics and attributes were recognized by the

25

Court of Appeals when it applied the practical
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

capability test.

2

And it said on page 15(a) of the petition

3

appendix that certainly living, a domicile, is a purpose

4

of a floating home, but mobility is also a purpose, and

5

then demonstrated that mobility here.

6
7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
how do you deal with Evansville?

8
9

Under your definition,

MR. FREDERICK:

Evansville is a case with

many layers, but let me just start first start with the

10

fact that the Court announced a practical capability

11

test in Evansville itself.

12

reviewed a district court record that had found no

13

practical capability on the basis of the driveways and

14

the more permanent connections to the utility system of

15

the city, and it reviewed that factual record for clear

16

error, which, of course, it didn't find, by --

17

That's what it applied.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What you are basically

18

saying, we reached the wrong conclusion because the

19

wharf boat floated, and it regularly was moved, and

20

there was nothing to suggest that it couldn't carry

21

people or things.

22

empty it, I understand, before they moved it, but it

23

could have.

24
25

It

It happened not to because they would

So if it was practically capable of
floating, whether it was semi-tied to land or not, it
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was released from land on somewhat of a regular basis.

2

So are you suggesting that in Stewart we change the

3

Evansville rule?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

In Stewart you said

5

what the holding of the case was, which was that it was

6

not practically capable of movement at the time that it

7

sank.

8
9

Now, I would like to just step back for a
second because I think Evansville needs to be understood

10

in the time in which it was decided.

11

courts, including this one, at times, applied a snapshot

12

test, what is happening to this particular watercraft at

13

the moment in time where an admiralty tort occurs, where

14

the contract ensues, and the like.

15

At that time, many

This Court subsequently disavowed the

16

snapshot test; but, in Stewart, what the Court did was

17

to describe Evansville and Cope as cases about not

18

practically capable of movement or carriage because of

19

their connections to the land.

20

In Evansville, the owner of the wharf boat

21

also owned the adjoining land and had control over the

22

dock and built driveways so that trucks could come on

23

and off, and had an eight-inch concrete lining on the

24

houseboat which are not typically -- sorry, on the wharf

25

boat, which are not typically attributes one would think

transport."

5

interpret with some degree of common sense, and the

6

reason for that is because each of us can of course

7

imagine all kinds of things, from Styrofoam sofas to --

8

to just dozens of absurd things that have nothing to do

9

with ships or vessels and really could be used

10

theoretically to carry something on the water.

11

"Practically capable of maritime

Now, those are words I thought you have to

So what we think of is that practical

12

capability means that there must -- this must really

13

have as a function, as one of its functions -- I'd like

14

to say purpose, but some people apparently don't like

15

that --

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18
19

-- because it - it has some

other implication that I don't understand.

Okay.

So call it the function or the capacity, and

20

it really does as a significant matter of carrying

21

things, and not just accoutrements like nails in its

22

walls, but -- but things from place to place to some

23

significant degree, okay?

24

of the test and through voice -- and trying to focus

25

your mind, I've said you have to do that really as a --

it has to be some significant degree there, which this

2

one doesn't seem to have, all right?

4

So you see what I'm trying to do, and really
it's a way of getting you to respond to that.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

I think it certainly did

6

have that.

7

because it was actually moved on multiple occasions.

8
9

things.

Suppose we had a trial on the question

of whether these floating homes or this floating home

of people who buy floating homes move it exactly once.

23

They purchase the floating home and then they move it to

the place where they want the home to be, and then it

25

sits there.

And this was just a clear evidence that,

The Titanic, of course, is a

perfect example of that.

3

The fact that a person may choose mobility

as a -- as one of the attributes and not exercise that

5

attribute of course goes to subjective intent, and as

6

the Maritime Law Association's brief points out here,

you do not want to apply an intent standard that goes to

transportation is to convey a person or a thing from one

We've

Yes -Is that a problem, and if

25

brief in this case which they have done in other cases
51
Alderson Reporting Company

in which transportation and vessel status have been

relevant like in Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, United

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

compelling in this case because they have regulations

saying, so it's not as if they were going to take a

8

different position.

saying follow the Coast Guard regulations.

The Solicitor General is basically

MR. FREDERICK:

10

And the statute underlying

11

those regulations, Justice Sotomayor, is found at 46 USC

12

4302, and it provides the secretary very broad

13

discretion on what to include within the regulations and

14

what not to.

the secretary suspended many regulations for dockside

After this court decided the Stewart case,

There is a hint, there is a suggestion

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I mean,

21

there is some easy things to visualize as a problem.

22

this is a vessel, then the maid that comes on twice a

23

week is a seaman under the Jones Act, right?

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

If

And the reason why is

because as this court recognized in Stewart, the in
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

navigation requirement is something that has been used

2

for limiting the reach of Jones Act seamen in those

3

circumstances in which a vessel is taken out of

4

navigation.

5

a case like this where this is a classic instance of a

6

maritime lien, dockage --

7

9

So I think that it would be appropriate in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, taken out

of navigation, but not every time it's docked, right?
MR. FREDERICK:

No.

But no -- and in fact,

10

I think the question of who is a Jones Act seaman is a

11

different test that this Court last discussed in the

12

Chandris case, in terms of its substantial connection to

13

the mission of the vessel.

14

Court could safely leave the Jones Act issues aside,

15

because they bring in an entirely different regime that

16

focuses on the worker's connection to the vessel as

17

opposed to the definition of vessel itself.

And that -- I think that the

18

The definition of vessel itself here is, as

19

Justice Scalia pointed out, part of the Dictionary Act,

20

and it is something that does apply more broadly.

21

as we briefed in this case, there are two provisions

22

that take that definition and then they add an intent

23

requirement as specific language in different parts.

24

that if that idea, function, or intent or purpose is

25

something that is germane to that particular statutory
53
Alderson Reporting Company

But

So

1

function, than that is a question that becomes a

2

question for jurisdiction.

3

But I'd also like to point out that both, I

4

think, the district court and the court of appeals here

5

assumed that there was jurisdiction here because there

6

had not been evidence that contested the basic

7

principles that the City brought when it profiled this

8

in rem action.

9

And because the case then moved into the

10

merits phase, the district judge here initially denied

11

the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction without

12

prejudice.

13

the question to provide a fuller explanation, and at

14

that time made the ruling that Mr. Lozman had not put in

15

record evidence that affected the practical capability

16

of the test.

17

And then as the evidence came in, revisited

The only thing Mr. Lozman argued in the

18

court of appeals as a reason for error was that because

19

he intended to live there indefinitely, even though he

20

had no contractual or property right to do so, and he

21

had signed a wet slip agreement that provided the marina

22

complete discretion to move his houseboat within any of

23

the slips, or to order of the houseboat to leave on 3

24

days' notice, the question of whether or not there was

25

any record of evidence on practical capability got to
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Eleventh Circuit, and the Eleventh Circuit, in

2

applying a practical capability test, said the things

3

that Mr. Lozman had argued, he didn't offer record

4

evidence.

5

So, Justice Kennedy, to your point, I think

6

that with respect to the Court of Appeals and how it did

7

do its job here is an important facet of the case as it

8

comes.

9

They initially asked you in the cert

10

petition, grant cert because the Fifth Circuit and the

11

Seventh Circuit have applied an onerous intent test.

12

They've not defended that test.

13

erroneous because you can't have vessel status be so

14

easily manipulated by an individual's intent.

15

by trying to morph it into some kind of function or

16

objective purpose standard, they've essentially done

17

exactly what the Eleventh Circuit said they had offered

18

no evidence in the district court to try to prove.

And it is abjectly

Mr. Fisher, you have 3 minutes left.

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

25

I think Mr. Frederick's best argument that
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I've heard, and some of this Court has echoed it, is

2

that this is a vessel because it was moved around and it

3

carried his personal effects.

4

argument runs absolutely headlong into Evansville and

5

Roper; it cannot be squared with those cases.

6

would be willing to rest my entire case on simply this

7

Court reading and applying those cases.

8
9

The difficulty is that

And I

In Evansville, this Court dealt with
something that carried around the effects of a business

10

office.

11

carried around grain and was far more seaworthy than the

12

structure in this case.

13

In Roper, this Court dealt with something that

Both instances, the Court said they're not

14

vessels because the function was not to carry those

15

things around, it was merely -- they were merely

16

incidental relocations.

17

Now -- so for that reason, the Eleventh

18

Circuit simply cannot be right when it says that

19

function is irrelevant.

20

its test either.

21

deal with those cases is to look at how securely the

22

structure is fashioned.

23

And the City can't be right on

The only way the City has proposed to

And Justice Kagan, you're exactly right.

24

you want a recipe for disaster on jurisdictional

25

questions, start asking whether it's chains or ropes.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

If

Official

1

And not only that, if you want something that's utterly

2

manipulable, just tell the yacht owner who has his yacht

3

down in the harbor that all he has to do is hook it up

4

to the dock with chains instead of ropes and now he's

5

out of maritime jurisdiction.

6

So this Court's cases for almost a century

7

have applied the exact test we're asking this Court to

8

apply.

9

that that's what the statute is best read as doing, that

10

is what we have done for over 100 years, and that is how

11

maritime law has built up and guaranteed on those -- on

12

those understandings.

13

And even if you're not 100 percent persuaded

And it's not just the questions we've been

14

talking today -- it's employment law, tort law, all the

15

rest are built on this test.

16

Court simply to reaffirm what it's done in the past.

And we're asking this

17

So I think that leaves the question of, when

18

you know the Eleventh Circuit applied the wrong test and

19

you know the City's test can't be right, do you vacate

20

or do you send -- or do you simply reverse?

21

think -- Justice Kennedy, we think that you can simply

22

reverse.

23

most notably in the surveyor's report.

24
25

And we

You have everything in the record you need,

And you can look at four things.

Look at

the -- look at the materials used, the shape of the
57
Alderson Reporting Company

1

structure, its equipment and the utilities.

2

materials used were plywood and ordinary land-based

3

structures.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

That is -- what was

used in the Higgins boats in World War II.

6

MR. FISHER:

I'm -- I'm not saying any of

7

these are determinative, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's a

8

totality that tells you what it is.

9

And the next thing is the shape.

Exactly as

10

you referred.

This is a rectangle that sits 10 inches

11

under the water, is not meant to be moved around.

12

at the -- look at its features.

13

three sides a few feet above the water line.

14

what a vessel -- not how a vessel is designed.

Look

It has French doors on
That's not

15

And finally, its utilities.

16

Appendix 40, for example, it says this thing has no

17

batteries.

18

to land.

19

Again, at Joint

It is utterly dependent on being hooked up
That's the only way it can function.
So if this Court does nothing else between

20

now and casting its vote and writing its opinion,

21

revisit this Court's prior cases and reassert the rule

22

that this Court has always applied.
