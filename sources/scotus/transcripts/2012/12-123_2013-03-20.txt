CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Mr. McConnell?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. McCONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

There's a surprising number of difficult

12

merits questions lurking in this case, mostly involving

13

whether there was a taking, and if so, how it should be

14

conceptualized and valued.

15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I -- could I just

stop you on a factual matter --

17

MR. McCONNELL:

Certainly.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because it has

19

confused me.

20

there appear to be two different partnerships:

21

partnership, known as Raisin -- doing business as Raisin

22

Valley Farms, has Mr. Horne and his wife as the

23

partners.

24
25

As I look at the captions of the cases,
One

Larsen Valley, the producer -- not the
producer, the handler -- has four other, the Hornes,

Alderson Reporting Company

plus two other people.

2

that the first partnership of the husband and wife?

3

isn't the handler a second partnership that does the

4

business of handling?

5

9

So who owns the raisins?

MR. McCONNELL:

Lassen were Laura Horne's parents, now deceased.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the estates have

been substituted.
MR. McCONNELL:

Substituted.

That's right.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

entities, one who owns and one who handles?

12

partnership produces, one partnership handles?
MR. McCONNELL:

So isn't it two legal
One

The Department of

14

Agriculture did not distinguish among them.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I don't care if

16

they did or they didn't.

17

they two separate legal entities?

18

And

The other two partners in

10

13

Isn't

I mean, we should know.

MR. McCONNELL:

Are

One who produces --

They are separate -- they

19

are separate legal entities, all effectively controlled

20

by the same family.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's -- you

22

know, in the cat -- you get some limited liability by

23

creating separate entities, so the creature who owns is

24

one partnership, and the -- and the entity that

25

produces, that handles, is a second one.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume this is one of

2

those difficult merits questions you were alluding to,

3

it doesn't go to whether there's jurisdiction, but to

4

whether the claim of a taking can be asserted by the

5

partnership in question, isn't it?

6
7

MR. McCONNELL:
Justice Scalia.

8
9
10

That's right,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- I don't see how

it goes to jurisdiction, which is the only question
before us.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it does to my mind

12

because what is the claim, assuming that the producer

13

owns -- the producer entity owns the raisins.

14

exactly is being taken from the handlers?

15

percentage -- it can't be the raisins because they don't

16

own them.

17

MR. McCONNELL:

What

Is it the

So the -- so the -What is it that's being

2

handler only, so the entire fine was paid by them.

3

of the fine is attributable to anyone in their capacity

4

as a producer.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

None

So go back.

6

What is the -- what was taken from them -- you're saying

7

it's just the fine, that the fine is a taking or -- what

8

was the interest that they're claiming was taken by the

9

government?

10
11

They didn't own the raisins, so they get

paid a fee for handling.
MR. McCONNELL:

So -- so this is -- this is

12

our position, Justice Sotomayor.

13

look at what is it that the Department of Agriculture

14

attempted to take.

15

Department of Agriculture addressed to the Hornes,

16

they -- they asked the Hornes to deliver California

17

raisins, or the dollar equivalent.

18

upon which all of this case is -- is built.

19

I think we have to

So, in the demand letter from the

So that's the fact

legal position, or it will be our legal position on the

22

merits that when the government seeks a specific

23

physical property, a res, or its monetary equivalent,

24

that that is a taking of the res itself.

25

and there's support for that in the -- for precedent

And then the city turned around and issued a

10

special assessment against the landowner for precisely

11

that $2,000.

12

and this Court held that it was a taking -- a taking of

13

the land.

14

The landowner came back up to this Court,

And in a subsequent case just a couple of

15

years later, the Court described this as a, quote

16

"actual confiscation of private property to public use."

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you -- you began by

18

saying that these are merits defenses, but you wanted to

19

focus first on -- on the jurisdictional question that's

20

before us.

21

MR. McCONNELL:

That's right.

I hope it

22

helps to inform the jurisdictional question.

But the

23

jurisdictional question is this:

24

that my clients could not even raise their takings claim

25

on the merits until they had first gone to the Court of

The Ninth Circuit held

Claims.

3
4

I think there are three things wrong with
that.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Am I right in thinking

5

that there is no dispute on that point, that the -- the

6

takings claim could have been asserted by the Hornes, as

7

producers, in the Court of Federal Claims?

8
9

MR. McCONNELL:

I think that the government

no longer disputes, although you should ask them to

10

be -- to be clear -- I think that they no longer dispute

11

that this is not a jurisdictional client, even though

12

they prevailed after the petition for rehearing was

13

filed in the Court of Appeals --

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. McCONNELL: -- on the ground that it was

16
17

Well, jurisdictional --

jurisdictional.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- jurisdictional or not,

18

as a practical matter, producers who are not subject to

19

fine as handlers, but the producers of the raisins whose

20

raisins are being segregated, could they go to the Court

21

of Federal Claims and say my raisins have been taken?

22

MR. McCONNELL:

The -- whether the claim is

23

being brought in the capacity of producer or handler I

24

think is not relevant to one of our arguments, and it is

25

relevant to the other argument.

It depends upon whether the

taking has been from them or not.

11

the ordinary relationship between a producer and a

12

handler, the producer is not paid for the reserve

13

raisins and therefore any payment that would come, any

14

lawsuit on behalf of those raisins would go to the

15

producer, and that would go I think to the Court of

16

Claims.

The producer was going

MR. McCONNELL:

I'm not sure which

money you're -- they have not asserted any claim on any

10

money.

11

is the handlers who have been held responsible.

12

reason they were held responsible was the following

13

logic, and you see this on -- on -- on page 78 of the

14

judicial officer's opinion.

15

The producers have been completely paid off.

It

And the

They were held responsible because in

16

their -- in their processing capacity, when they were

17

doing the stemming, the seeding, the fumigating, the

18

packing, that this was regarded by the Department of

19

Agriculture as possession -- physical possession of the

20

raisins and acquisition of the raisins, even though they

21

never had title to the raisins.

22

It's the Department of Agriculture that has

23

attached to them a possessory interest in the raisins

24

and then assessed them the full monetary equivalent of

25

those raisins, full market value, $484,000 for the

Alderson Reporting Company

2

unusual regulatory scheme the government regards them as

having possessed the raisins even though that -- that is

not --

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. McConnell, I'm sorry.

6

Could I -- along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg was

7

saying, suppose that the Hornes had given over all the

8

raisins, right, but that they thought that this was

9

improper, that this marketing order was -- it was a

10

violation of the takings clause.

11

to the Court of Claims, via the Tucker Act, and said, we

12

want our money back?

13

Could they have gone

They gave -- they gave over the raisins,

14

they say we're entitled to compensation.

15

have gone through the Court of Claims?

16

MR. McCONNELL:

Could they

If they had -- if they had

17

not been paid for the raisins, they had taken raisins to

18

a handler, received no money for them, I think that they

19

could go to the Court of Claims.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In other words, the Hornes

21

did what the marketing order suggested they should do.

22

They gave over the raisins.

improper.

But they said this is just

You're saying they could go to the Court of

MR. McCONNELL:

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So if -- if that's

2

the case, I guess then the question is, why didn't they

3

have to go that route?

4

MR. McCONNELL:

They didn't -- they didn't

5

go that route, and the question I think is what are the

6

-- what are the legal consequences of that --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

8

MR. McCONNELL:

-- because what they -- what

9

they knew was that they were not going to be compensated

10

for the raisins, and therefore they came up with a --

11

with a plan, a business plan that they believed made --

12

eliminated any handler and made it unnecessary for any

13

of the independent producers, on whose behalf they're

14

operating, to turn over raisins to the government.

15

The plan was ultimately rejected and we

16

haven't brought a -- a cert petition on it, but the plan

17

actually complies with the -- with the language of

18

the -- of the regulation because they believe that in

19

their capacity as handler, as processor, that they never

20

acquired the raisins.

21

becoming a handler under the rule.

22

"Acquisition" is the key term for

And they believe that since they were simply

23

providing a service for -- for $12 a ton to their

24

neighbors, that they never acquired the raisins, they

25

never possessed the raisins, and therefore no one had to

Some of the raisins were their own.

4

MR. McCONNELL:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6

That's correct.
At least as to that, that

wouldn't be true, right?
MR. McCONNELL:

7
8

Well, some of the raisins

That's -- that's correct.

I

think that's correct.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Well, to get you back to

10

the -- the jurisdiction point, let's -- let's just

11

assume a hypothetical case where a regulated entity has

12

to pay an exaction which it deems to be a penalty.

13

let's assume it can go to the Court of Claims, but it

14

doesn't.
It waits until the penalty's assessed and

15
16

then when the penalty's assessed it says, this is a

17

taking.

18

discuss with us today?

19

And

That -- is that the case that you want to

MR. McCONNELL:

That's right.

When the

20

underlying order would be a taking and they have been

21

assessed money because they didn't comply with the

22

taking, we believe they can challenge that as a taking.

23

And both under the AMAA procedures, in which are exclusive,

24

I think that they have to go through the -- through the

25

Department of Agriculture and then to the district

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 14

court, but I also think under the principles of the --

2

announced by this Court in of the Apfel decision that

3

they are entitled to a remedy in the district court.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. McConnell, would you

5

explain the -- if they were just handlers and weren't

6

producing any raisins, if they were just handlers, do

7

they have a claim and where?

8

producers -- I take it from the question I asked and the

9

question Justice Kagan asked that if they were just

And if they were just

10

producers, the raisins got set aside, they were paid for

11

only the ones that went to market, they could go to the

12

Court of Claims.

13

But now they're just handlers, as this

14

entity is for most of the raisins that are involved,

15

some 80 percent, right?

16

their own.

17

a handler, doesn't produce any raisins?

18

MR. McCONNELL:

19

It's only about 20 percent is

So could this work for someone who was just

So if they are just a

handler --

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

MR. McCONNELL:

Yes.

-- as the Department of

22

Agriculture treated them, as far as the Department of

Agriculture is concerned they are only a handler.

24

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What I'm -- I'm trying to

3

understand is this scheme.

Apparently it wasn't enough

4

just to be a handler or just to be a producer.

5

claim that you're making turns on the coincidence of

6

being both the producer and a handler.

7

MR. McCONNELL:

I don't think that that's

8

so.

9

on either -- in either of their capacities.

I think that we -- that the Hornes ought to prevail

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So any handler, any

11

handler could be making the same claim?

12

MR. McCONNELL:

13

business model that is similar to this.

14

handlers --

15
16
17

The

Any handler who has a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But most

But what do you mean

by -- what's the business model that's similar to this?
MR. McCONNELL:

So most handlers, if they're

18

in compliance with the order, they take all the raisins

19

from the producers, they only pay for -- for the free

20

pool of raisins.

21

and they never have any interest in the reserve raisins.

22

In this case, the Hornes did not operate that way.

23

The -- the producers received full value for all of

24

their raisins.

25

They don't pay for the reserve raisins

So the producers are -- are not in the case.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16

They have no standing.

They have no pocketbook injury.

The -- the entire pocketbook injury in this case is

3

borne by the Hornes in their capacity as a handler.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

In response to -In the Horne model, the

7

handlers buy -- buy the free raisins and then pay the

8

producers, is that what it --

9

MR. McCONNELL:

10

That's correct.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, so that's the

11

difference in this model, they don't take title to the

12

raisins is what you're saying?

13

MR. McCONNELL:

Exactly.

And the Hornes

14

believed that this would mean that they were not

15

handlers.

16
17
18
19
20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Let me --

let me -MR. McCONNELL:

And that -- and they were

found to be handlers anyway.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What is -- what is the

21

value in permitting a party who doesn't own property to

22

raise a taking claim on behalf of other people?

23

Meaning, doesn't the system have an interest in ensuring

24

that people comply with their legal obligations, and to

25

the extent that you choose to violate the law the way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 17

1

they have here, that the fine is punitive and not

2

compensatory.

3

Meaning, you don't own the raisins, but you

4

were obligated to put raisins aside for someone else.

5

You were their agent and you failed to meet a government

6

obligation that was independently on you.

7

MR. McCONNELL:

8

question:

No.

What was the taking?

So I go back to my
Since you didn't own

10

the raisins, the taking is the fine is what you want to

11

call the taking.

12

MR. McCONNELL:

The taking is what the

13

government demanded, which was either give me your house

14

or give me your money, give me your raisins or give us

15

the monetary equivalent.

But they're not your

They’re not your raisins.
MR. McCONNELL:

By the time -- by the time

19

this order was enforced, the raisins were gone and so as

20

a practical matter, only one of those two alternatives

21

was left as a matter of timing.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, but in answer to

23

Justice Ginsburg's question that -- you said the

24

producers could go to the -- the Court of Federal Claims

25

to contest the taking of -- producers could go to

although we are fining you $700,000 in your capacity as

a handler, you're not a handler for purposes of

challenging the legality of that order.

There -- there are some people, they've been

-- they are either -- they have some raisins, all right.

And these particular people, whom the Department has

said have acquired the raisins, it said they acquired

7

the raisins.

and then the government says, do this thing with your

raisins.

10

And so they're there with some raisins,

And they don't want to do it, so they don't.

They don't do it even though the law says do it.

11

And then they say the law is

unconstitutional and, moreover, you fined us a huge

13

amount of money and we don't want to pay it because the

14

law is unconstitutional, and we consider that money that

we paid.

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. McCONNELL:

Yes?
-- which is that this is the

3

proceeding here that decides whether they have to pay.

They have not yet paid the fine.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

unconstitutional.

JUSTICE BREYER:

And then the Ninth Circuit

14

So we

MR. McCONNELL:

And you say no, we

But that detail actually is

quite important because, remember, you can't even go to

16

the Court of Claims unless you are seeking damages for

17

an actual violation that has already taken place.

18

could not go to the court -- the Hornes could not go to

19

the Court of Claims right now.

20

is that they should pay the $700,000 fine first and then

21

go to the Court of Claims to get it back.

22

exactly what this Court said in Apfel, is a, quote,

23

"pointless set of activities that Congress could not

24

possibly have" --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We

What the government says

That's true --

Alderson Reporting Company

And that is

Official
Page 22

MR. McCONNELL:

-- "have contemplated."

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think that's true, Mr.

3

McConnell, as to part of the fine, that part of the fine

4

falls under Apfel, but not the other part.

5

compensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty

6

decent Apfel argument.

7

don't really understand how the Apfel argument would go.

8
9

As to the

But as to the penalty part, I

It seems to me that as to the penalty part,
the key thing is that if they had handed over the

10

raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal

11

Claims and had the compensation done there.

12

fact that the government is penalizing them for not

13

complying with the marketing order does not fall within

14

the rationale of Apfel.

15

MR. McCONNELL:

And the

Well, the most pertinent

16

case for that part of the fine, for the penalty part, is

17

Missouri Pacific Railroad v. Nebraska.

18

case where the railroad was told by the State to do

19

some -- some expensive work, the railroad says no, that

20

would be a taking if we were required to do that.

21

is no compensation available and so they don't do it.

22

They're fined $500.

23

So this is the

There

That gets up to this Court and an opinion by

24

Mr. -- Justice Holmes, the Court holds that that is a

25

taking and that the railroad is entitled to challenge

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 23

1

the taking in the form of the fine.

2

penalty portion, the punishment portion of the fine,

3

Missouri Pacific Railroad is actually the more pertinent

4

decision.

5

So for -- for the

Which comes back -- I don't think I fully

6

answered all the variants of Justice Sotomayor's

7

question.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

All I was trying to do was

to get you on the basic argument, which you started

10

with, which is why is there -- why was the Ninth Circuit

11

wrong when they said they had no jurisdiction to hear

12

this, that rather, they had to go -- you had to go to

13

the --

14
15

MR. McCONNELL:
reasons?

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. McCONNELL:

18
19

May I tick off the three

Yes.
One is it has nothing to do

with jurisdiction.
Second, the Tucker Act does not apply to

20

cases where -- where there is a defense being lodged to

21

a monetary exaction.

22

Missouri Pacific Railroad.

23

That's Apfel, as supplemented by

And third, even if that were not so, the

24

AMAA displaces the Tucker Act and they were required to

25

exhaust their remedies before the Department of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 24

Agriculture and take their case to the district court in

2

which they are residing.

3
4

JUSTICE SCALIA:
forgot the first already.

5

What was the first?

I

What was the first?

MR. McCONNELL:

The first is that it isn't

6

jurisdictional and therefore it should not have been

7

raised --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what isn't

jurisdictional?

10

MR. McCONNELL:

The -- the requirement to go

11

to the Court of Claims when you -- when you need to is

12

not jurisdictional, that that's a matter of remedy, that

13

is, it's -- it's the equitable principle that you may

14

not pursue your case for an injunctive relief when

15

there's an adequate remedy at law.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. McConnell, in --

17

in -- if the producers had decided to challenge this as

18

a Tucker Act violation, they would have had to hand over

19

the raisins?

20

raisins and said, I'm not handing it over until I get

21

just compensation?

22

Or could they have just held on to the

MR. McCONNELL:

So had they held on to their

23

own raisins and sold them, I assume, you don't -- not

24

just left them rot, if they had sold them, then the

25

Department of Agriculture would have called them a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 25

1

handler because anyone who sells raisins is called a

2

handler, and then they would be fined in their capacity

3

as a handler and it would be a somewhat similar case to

4

this one.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. McCONNELL:

7
8
9

All right.

Maybe an easier one than

this one.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the point is that

under a normal takings claim, you have to hand over your

10

property, you've lost the value, and you want the

11

government to pay it back to you, correct?

12

MR. McCONNELL:

Not necessarily correct.

13

There are a whole string of cases in which property

14

owners raise takings as a defense rather than turning

15

over the property.

16

best known recent case, but out of an administrative

17

context, there's the Florida Power & Light case.

18

Central was -- was like this.

19

is like this.

20

Kaiser Aetna is perhaps the most --

Penn

Loretto v. Teleprompter

There's a whole string of cases.

The

21

government themselves cite six such cases, most of them

22

fairly old, for this proposition.

23

unusual about bringing a -- a defensive takings claim.

So there's nothing

24

Mr. Chief Justice, unless --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. McConnell, I don't

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

want to encroach on your rebuttal time, but one

2

mysterious thing.

3

Circuit decided this case on the merits.

4

right, I take it, we remand and then they adjudicate the

5

merits of the takings claim.

6

The first time around, the Ninth

MR. McCONNELL:

So if you're

But they already did that.
Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

And

7

they did that on a ground that we think is manifestly

8

inconsistent with this Court's precedents.

9

prepared to -- we were trying to get an en banc review

We were

10

and were prepared to come to this Court from the merits

11

determination.

12

We were blocked from that because the

13

government, after the petition for rehearing was filed,

14

came up with -- calling this a jurisdictional argument,

15

raised this objection for the first time; and the Ninth

16

Circuit panel accepted their view, issued a new opinion,

17

stripping out the entire merits, and substituting this

18

jurisdictional holding that is producing so much

enjoyment for us this morning.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. PALMORE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. PALMORE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

5

I'd like to start where Justice Sotomayor

6

started with Petitioner's counsel because any takings

7

analysis needs to begin with a careful identification of

8

what property was allegedly taken.

9

case have actually advanced two different theories about

10

what property of theirs was taken.

11

issue here?

12

Petitioners in this

What taking is at

Raisins and money.
We think both takings claims fail for

13

threshold reasons, but they're different threshold

14

reasons that call for different analysis.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Palmore, before you do

16

that then, have you conceded the point that this is

17

not jurisdictional?

18

MR. PALMORE:

We agree that the failure to

19

go to the Court of Claims is not properly viewed as a

20

jurisdictional defect.

21

precedent below stating that it was jurisdictional.

22

some of this cases -- this Court's cases put it in

23

ripeness terms, which is an Article III concept.

24

there has been confusion --

25

We did invoke Ninth Circuit

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

So

When did you first

Alderson Reporting Company

raise the argument that it was jurisdictional?

2
3

MR. PALMORE:
rehearing petition.

4
5

In our opposition to the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And now you are --

now you are changing back again and saying it's not?

6

MR. PALMORE:

There was Ninth Circuit

7

precedent holding that it was jurisdictional, and we

8

relied on that and there is certainly language from this

9

Court --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You relied on that

11

when you got to rehearing.

You didn't rely on that

12

before you went before the Ninth Circuit, right?

13

MR. PALMORE:

That's correct.

14

We think -- we think this is properly viewed

15

as a substantive defect in the claim, so in a sense the

16

Ninth Circuit, in its initial panel decision, ruled for

17

the government on a substantive defect one, there's no

18

taking.

19

although it attached the wrong label to it, it

20

substantively was correct in concluding that there was

21

substantive defect number two --

22

And what it did on rehearing in our view,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mr. Palmore, if you are

23

conceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems

24

to me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive

25

argument, I mean, has been waived.

You didn't raise

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 29

1

that argument until the rehearing petition.

2

MR. PALMORE:

That would certainly be

3

something that -- that the Ninth Circuit could consider

4

in the event there were a remand here.

5

Circuit did decide it.

6

conclusion was correct and all of its analysis was

7

correct.

8

is here.

9

But the Ninth

The substance of its bottom line

It simply used the wrong words, so we think it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm really -- I'm really

10

confused.

You are saying there ought to be a remand

11

here because the question is not jurisdictional, which

12

is just what your friend says, right?

13

MR. PALMORE:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the Ninth Circuit -So the two of you are in

15

agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they

16

should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong,

17

we can review that.

18

MR. PALMORE:

Look, if that happens, of

19

course, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, the consequence

20

for us is they reinstate the prior panel opinion, in

21

which we win, also --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

MR. PALMORE:

That may well be, but --

I'm not going to resist too

24

strenuously that kind of remand, but they did decide it.

25

And moreover, they decided something separate, which is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 30

1

at JA-305 they said something different, which is the

2

kind of threshold defect in the takings claim turning on

3

raisins, which is there is a capacity problem.

4

So there are two problems with the raisin

5

claim, a capacity problem and a just compensation

6

problem.

7

having been strictly raisin producers since 1969,

8

entering into a market where there was a reserve

9

requirement from the beginning, they knew what they were

The capacity problem is this:

In 2002, after

10

getting into, they decided to adopt a new business

11

model, as Petitioner's counsel says.

12

below, they adopted a business model that was an

13

intentional, willful attempt to evade regulatory

14

requirements in order to secure an unfair competitive

15

advantage.

16

But, as was found

But what they did was they took on the

17

obligations of a handler.

They became raisin handlers

18

in 2002.

19

of regulatory obligations that apply only to handlers

20

and under the AMAA can apply only to handlers:

21

requirement to have raisins inspected, the requirement

22

to file truthful reports, the requirement to make

23

records available, and the requirement to separate out

24

raisins into what's called free tonnage and reserve

25

tonnage, any raisins processed, it doesn't matter who

And what came with that status were a series

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official
Page 31

1

owns them.

2

Those are handler-specific regulatory

3

obligations that were imposed upon them, and they

4

violated every single one of them, willfully and

5

intentionally, in order to secure an unfair competitive

6

advantage.

7

And what the USDA did was impose penalties

8

on them for the violation of law that -- that attached

9

to them only as raisin handlers.

And then they invoked

10

the judicial review proceedings in Section 14 that

11

provides a judicial review mechanism only for handlers.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but part of -- part of

13

that penalty was -- you know, your raisins or your life,

14

right?

I mean, it was --

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

the penalty if you give us the raisins.

18

MR. PALMORE:

-- you don't have to pay

That's not correct,

19

Justice Scalia.

20

Mr. McConnell referred to demand letters --

21

They have to give the raisins.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You mean they -- Is that

22

right, they have to give the raisins?

23

MR. PALMORE:

They are under a regulatory

24

obligation to provide the raisins.

If they violate that

25

regulatory obligation, they are subject to sanctions.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 32

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

MR. PALMORE:

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

Okay.

So --

One component of --- that amounts to the same

thing, your raisins or the penalty, right?

5

MR. PALMORE:

No, but it's not a choice.

6

And I think that's very important to point out.

There

7

were actually two different demand letters.

8

Mr. McConnell referred to a demand letter saying your

9

raisins or your money.

There was an initial demand

10

letter saying:

You are a handler; you have to comply;

11

we're going to come get the raisins.

12

letter said, we showed up -- literally it says, we

13

showed up with our truck, you didn't provide the

14

raisins, so now you have got to provide the cash

15

equivalent.

The second demand

16

And there were also going to be, as there

17

were, separate regulatory proceedings brought against

18

them for violating those -- those obligations.

19

the failure to reserve, but all these handler-specific

20

obligations.

21

make raisins available for inspection.

They filed false reports.

Not just

They didn't

22

There were a whole host of regulatory

23

violations that were at issue here, and when they

24

invoked the handler review action in the district court

25

they could assert defenses as a handler.

Alderson Reporting Company

But, for

Official
Page 33

1

instance, another producer -- producers can't invoke

2

these -- these judicial review schemes.

3

producer couldn't have intervened in that action to

4

assert its producer claim.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Another

As this case stands when --

6

as it comes before us, is there a claim that they --

7

that money -- the government is trying to take money

8

from them without just compensation?

9

MR. PALMORE:

That was certainly not how we

10

understood the claim to be litigated below.

11

how the Ninth Circuit thought -- understood the claim.

12

We have been talking about the claim involving the

13

raisins, which fails for a to capacity reason and a just

14

compensation reason.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's not

Is that an issue -- is that

16

an issue we should decide or is that an issue that the

17

Ninth Circuit should decide, whether there is a takings

18

claim for money?

19

MR. PALMORE:

That was certainly not decided

20

below, so a remand -- to the extent that this was

21

preserved, a remand would be possible outcome there.

22

think, though, that that claim suffers from separate --

23

separate procedural threshold defects.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

All right.

If we assume for

the sake of argument that there is such a claim, why

Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official
Page 34

2

does that not fall within Apfel?
MR. PALMORE:

Well, we think that -- for

3

several reasons.

First of all, the Apfel opinion that's

4

referred to is just a plurality.

5

by the Court.

6

on this one-for-one, dollar-for-dollar concept.

7

was a critical part of the plurality's discussion there,

8

and it thought that it would simply be a pointless

9

exercise for Eastern Enterprises to be required to pay

It's not been adopted

Second of all, the Apfel analysis relied
That

10

the premium and then to go to the Court of Federal

11

Claims and get the exact same amount of money back.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. PALMORE:

14

whole host of reasons --

15

Don't they claim that --

JUSTICE ALITO:

We suggested that there are a

Before you leave that, don't

16

they claim that the entire amount that is assessed

17

against them is a taking?

18

That the entire amount assessed against them is a taking

19

without just compensation?

20

isn't that a merits question?

21

MR. PALMORE:

Now, maybe they are wrong.

Maybe they are wrong, but

That's -- that's -- they are

22

clearly wrong about that, and I -- but I think --

23

however you characterize that defect, it defeats this

24

dollar-for-dollar pointless exercise point that

25

Apfel plurality --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 35

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why is that a

2

necessary part of Apfel?

3

when we are dealing with cash you don't have to go to

4

the Court of Claims?

5

have a discussion in the district court about whether

6

it's not dollar-for-dollar and it should be discounted

7

in some way.

8
9

Why didn't Apfel just mean

So even if -- you know, you can

But why should the fact that its
dollar-for-dollar mean -- why is that a requirement, as

10

opposed to just it's cash and so the question of,

11

like -- you know, handing some -- handing it all over

12

and getting some back, that can be done in the district

13

court rather than making somebody file a separate suit?

14

MR. PALMORE:

Well, I think there were two

15

things going on in Apfel and there were really two

16

distinct reasons why the plurality in Apfel thought that

17

there was no requirement to go to the Tucker Act there.

18

One was that it thought that in a statute like that,

19

that simply allocated benefits and burdens among private

20

entities, Congress would not have intended there to be

21

compensation available in the -- in the event that there

22

were a taking.

23

And that was actually the government's

24

position in that case and the Apfel plurality cited to

25

that portion of the government's brief.

Alderson Reporting Company

And it cited

Official
Page 36

1

cases in its discussion that weren't dollar-for-dollar

2

or even cash transfer cases in which the Court had gone

3

to the merit of takings claims without consideration of

4

a Tucker Act remedy.

5

Then there is the second idea, which is the

6

cash transfer idea.

And we think that the

7

dollar-for-dollar aspect of that was important to the

8

plurality's analysis because it viewed that as evidence

9

that Congress would not have intended the Tucker Act to

10

be deployed because it would have been a pointless

11

exercise.

12

was.

13

So it really went to what Congress's intent

Here, of course, for myriad reasons, that

14

dollar-for-dollar analysis breaks down.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, but there's a

16

similar -- I mean, it seemed to me, again simplifying,

17

that underlying this their clients think this whole

18

raisin program is unconstitutional.

19

takes raisins that we grow, in effect throws them in the

20

river.

21

raisin prices.

22

What it does is it

And in the thirties, that was done to raise

And they think as a matter of policy that

23

just hurts people by raising prices, and as a matter of

24

constitutional law it takes raisins from some people

25

that belong to them and uses them for this bad purpose.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 37

1

Okay, that's their view of it, something like that,

2

isn't it?

3

MR. PALMORE:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

So they're making

5

that kind of constitutional claim.

Now, I would think

6

if all you told me was that and I knew nothing about all

7

these statutes, I would say that's the kind of claim

8

that should be made in a Federal district court, period,

9

not the Court of Claims.

Because their government isn't

10

going to compensate them for anything.

11

the whole point of the program.

12

That's against

Either this program is valid or it isn't.

13

And if it isn't, some authoritative set of courts should

14

tell us that.

15

right fit with the Court of Claims.

16
17
18

So I have a feeling this is somehow not a

Now, you explain to me why that purely
instinctive feeling at this point is completely wrong.
MR. PALMORE:

Sure.

now shifted back to the -- the first theory about the

20

property, which is the raisins.

21

done in 2002, would they have been a producer of

22

raisins, solely a producer of raisins for decades, at

23

any point during -- between 1969 and 2002, they could

24

have gone to the Court of Claims and said, this reserve

25

requirement, is a taking of my raisins, I want my just

compensation.

2

That is not just a remedy, as Mr. McConnell

3

suggests, it is a constitutional condition on the taking

4

of private property for public use.

5

just compensation, there simply is no violation.

6

that's why --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As long as there's
So

That couldn't be what the

8

statute meant.

I think that's what Justice Breyer says.

9

Did -- did Congress create a statute in which we're

10

going to take your raisins and then you can go to the

11

Court of Claims and get your money back.

12

that -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated.

13

The -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get

14

your money back in the Court of Claims.

15

I mean,

Now, if you're raising a constitutional

16

objection, that's something else.

17

in district court.

18

contemplated -- you know, we'll take your raisins and

19

then you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your

20

money back.

21

That should be done

But to say that Congress

That's a weird statute.
MR. PALMORE:

Justice Scalia, I have two --

22

two responses to that.

First of all, these claims have

23

been litigated in the Court of Claims; the Evans case,

24

the Cal-Almond case, both of which we cite in our brief.

25

Raisin producers, or in the Cal-Almond case it was an

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 39

1

almond producer, went to the Court of Claims and said

2

this reserve requirement is a taking, I want my money.

3

And they lost; and the Court of Claims -- correctly, in

4

our view -- held that there was no taking.

5

That said, we do agree that it is actually a

6

close question whether Congress would have intended

7

compensation to be provided in a situation like this

8

one, in the event the raisin reserve program were found

9

to be a taking.

We've said -- we've said in our brief,

10

we do view that as a close question, although on

11

balance, we think that the proper answer is that there

12

is a remedy -- or, sorry, there is just compensation

13

available in the Court of Claims.

14

But there are cases, Justice --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you -- you think that's

16

a close question?

17

supposed to operate, once it is held that this is an

18

unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the

19

government takes the raisins and every year, the grower

20

goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for

21

the raisins.

22

anticipated?

23

You think that the way the statute is

What's the purpose of that?

MR. PALMORE:

Well, of course, Congress

5

didn't think this was a taking.

6

considerable administrative flexibility into the

7

statute, and at the end of the day, that's what

8

convinces us that Congress would not have intended to

9

preclude compensation in the Court of Claims and to --

10

to opt for an injunction instead because the Secretary

11

of Agriculture has wide latitude to adjust.

12

And it -- and it built

MR. PALMORE:

Justice Ginsburg, I think this

goes back again to the property question.

15

is that it's unconstitutional because it takes

producers' property, they can't raise that in this

proceeding.

18

raise that in this proceeding.

comply and go to the Court of Claims for compensation,

compensation is provided.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. PALMORE:

If the claim

If the claim -- if the claim

is that the money that was taken from me, the fine, that

itself is a taking, then we think that claim can and

2

must be brought in the context of the AMAA proceeding.

3

That was not how the Court of Appeals understood the

4

claim here to be, and there's no precedent for the idea

5

that a fine for violation of law can be articulated as a

6

taking of the lawbreaker's property without just

7

compensation.

8

stands for that proposition and that would be quite

9

remarkable.

10

I haven't seen any case that -- that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. PALMORE:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What the Ninth

Well, Justice Kennedy -I -- I thought that what

15

we were going to decide was whether or not, assuming you

16

can go to the Court of Claims, you must go to the Court

17

of Claims, can you prefer to wait, have a penalty

18

assessed against you and say this is unconstitutional,

19

it's a taking.

20

don't understand why.

21

about Williamson and so forth, we can get into that.

22

Your position is you can't say that.

I

Other than, if you want to talk

MR. PALMORE:

But, Justice Kennedy, the --

23

the Ninth Circuit didn't understand the taking claim to

24

be that the fine for my violation of law is a taking of

25

my money.

That's not how the Ninth Circuit understood

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 43

1

the claim, so they didn't analyze it in that way.

2

They understood the claim to be that the

3

taking of producers' raisins is a taking, and we

4

lawfully resisted it because it was an unconstitutional

5

taking.

6

because there was nothing unconstitutional about it

7

because it was not without just compensation.

The Ninth Circuit correctly rejected that

8
9

The Tucker Act is the just compensation.
This Court has held --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

The just compensation, I

11

take it, in the program is supposed to come from the

12

fact that raisin prices go up.

14

pay the raisins, their parents are the ones who are

paying the compensation.

producers will pay, some who get gypped or something, I

18

don't know.

20

they have to pay higher prices as consumers.

So the poor children

And certainly not the

But I can't believe that Congress wanted

21

MR. PALMORE:

22

to the -- to the merits of the case.

23

Justice Breyer, and that goes

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

No, it doesn't go

24

to the merits.

It goes to whether or not it makes sense

25

to think that the Court of Claims has something to say

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 44

1

about this.

And suppose we did this.

Suppose we said,

2

given the fact that you filed your thing, whatever it

3

was -- you know, late, and the -- and the light of this

4

very enlightening discussion which has been helpful, we

5

think this is the kind of program and challenge to

6

the program where there isn't going to be a remedy

7

really in the Court of Claims and they ought to go ahead

8

in the Ninth Circuit, and in light of all these

9

enlightening things that we'll write, you just decide

10

the merits of -- is that -- now, I'm sure you're going

11

to say that's absolutely terrible, it won't work at all.

12

So tell me why not.

13

MR. PALMORE:

Well, Your Honor, of course,

14

the consequence of that is they reinstate our prior

15

victory in the prior panel opinion --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, we'd say -- we'll

17

say given the way that we've talked about the program,

18

perhaps it's best to consider this matter fully.

19

MR. PALMORE:

20

matter fully.

21

no taking here.

Well, they did consider the

In the initial opinion, they said there's

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. PALMORE:

Yes.

So all of the discussion we're

24

having here is about -- is predicated on the idea that

25

if there were a taking, would compensation be available

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 45

1

in the first place.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. PALMORE:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

Can I --

We agree there's no taking.
All right.

It almost

5

seems to me, and I'll ask Mr. McConnell when he gets up

6

at rebuttal, that there is some sort of due process

7

challenge going on here that's been created by the

8

labels they did in this new situation -- in this new

9

business venture.

In the normal situation, the handler,

10

I'm being told, would actually have title to the

11

raisins, and they would pay the producers for the

12

raisins.

13

So there would be property taking.
In that situation, where the handlers

14

actually own the property, would they be able to raise a

15

taking defense?

16

MR. PALMORE:

No, because of the way that

17

the statute and the regulatory program works.

18

handler is actually buying raisins from the producer,

19

the handler never takes title to the reserve raisins.

20

And he doesn't pay for the reserve raisins.

21

title to the free-tonnage raisins and the title to the

22

reserve raisins passes, as a matter of law, from the

23

producer to the Raisin Administrative Committee.

24

handler never owns those raisins.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the

He takes

The

So they are missing a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 46

1

business opportunity because they can't take title to

2

those raisins.

3

And yet you're asking --

MR. PALMORE:

They would never pay for

4

those -- they would never pay for those raisins because

5

they can't take title.

6

to those raisins.

7

They can't lawfully take title

Now --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This really does sound

8

to me -- and I think that both Justice Scalia and Breyer

9

now are being more and more convinced -- there has to be

10

a place to challenge this scheme.

11

MR. PALMORE:

And there absolutely is.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Whether it's a taking --

13

whether there's a takings claim for the handler because

14

the handler is being asked to do things --

15

MR. PALMORE:

16

not being taken, and that's critical.

17

separate takings claims that handlers have advanced

18

that -- that could be asserted through this process.

19

For instance, there was a case called Lion Raisins from

20

the Federal Circuit that we cite in our brief, in which

21

the issue was that the handler provided bins to store

22

the raisins, and he didn't get his bins back.

23

But the handler's property is
There are

Okay?

That was a handler takings claim, and that

24

had to be asserted in the context of this handler review

25

scheme.

But the handler doesn't own the raisins under

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 47

1
2

this scheme.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's -- that's a merits

3

question again.

4

you -- you can resist on the basis of a takings claim.

5

It's a question of whether you are going to win.

6

I mean, it's not a question of whether

MR. PALMORE:

No, Justice Scalia, I think it

7

goes to the scope, the capacity question that we were

8

talking about before because the statute is quite clear

9

in section 608c(13)(B) that this scheme does not

10

regulate producers in their capacity as producers.

11

if someone wants to take on both roles, they will be

12

regulated only as a handler.

13

And

So the regulatory obligations that applied

14

to Petitioners when they adopted this business model

15

were handler-only regulatory obligations, and then this

16

is a handler judicial review proceeding.

17

narrow means of decision here that avoids some of these

18

kind of conceptual questions about the nature of the --

19

the Takings Clause, which is that this claim simply

20

doesn't belong in this proceeding.

That's a very

21

But there's no unfairness or no due process

22

issue here at all because they -- in 2002, when -- when

23

Petitioners decided to engage in this, these regulatory

24

violations in order to secure an unfair advantage over

25

their competitors, as was found by the ALJ at JA41, at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 48

1

that point they could have sought compensation for the

2

past 6 years of raisins that they had provided.

3

didn't do it.

4

They

I don't understand why they didn't do it.

5

They left that claim on the table.

6

they wanted to claim going forward, they could have

7

continued to use compliant handlers and sued every month

8

for compensation in the Court of Claims.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And to the extent

Did I understand you to say

10

a couple minutes ago that if the case were remanded, you

11

would be entitled to win on the reasoning of the panel

12

opinion?

13

MR. PALMORE:

The prior panel opinion,

14

Justice.

15

the Ninth Circuit misunderstood this as a jurisdictional

16

Article III defect, and then the Ninth Circuit were to

17

find waiver, what the Ninth Circuit presumably would do

18

would be to reinstate its first panel decision, which we

19

think was also correct and held that there was no taking

20

here.

21

If -- if there was a remand on the basis that

There are two -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Palmore, what would be

22

wrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a

23

disposition of this Court that went something like this:

24

Everybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional

25

issue, including the government, so they got that wrong.

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, as to this whole business about the

2

Tucker Act and whether the Tucker Act provides a remedy,

3

the government only started talking about that in a

4

petition for rehearing en banc, and the government can't

5

do that.

6

7

waived.

8
9
10

You know, it can't introduce an argument like
So that's

And now, the Ninth Circuit can go and try to
figure out whether this marketing order is a taking or
it's just the world's most outdated law.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. PALMORE:

That would certainly be an

13

available option, or the Ninth Circuit could decide for

14

itself whether there had been a waiver.

15

But there's a separate issue in that there's

16

this capacity issue, which is a separate point that the

17

Ninth Circuit made at JA305, when it pointed out that

18

this was a producer claim, and that's something that --

19

that was strictly a producer claim and wasn't -- wasn't

20

a fit for this handler review action, and that's

21

something that could also be considered on remand.

22

But the consequence of this -- of that would

23

be for the -- the Court to impose its -- if it found a

24

waiver, to rule for us for separate merits reasons.

25

We do view the Tucker Act -- the failure to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 50

1

seek just compensation -- as a merits defect in the

2

Petitioners' claim here.

3

problem aside, there is simply -- there's no defense.

4

Mr. McConnell says that this can be raised as a defense.

5

But there is no defense if all you show is that there has

6

been a taking of private property for public use, full

7

stop.

8
9

So even putting this capacity

JUSTICE BREYER:
"acquire" mean.

What does the word

There is some opinion here which says

10

these handlers acquired the raisins.

11

that about?

12

MR. PALMORE:

"Acquire" is a defined term,

13

and it includes to possess.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

What is -- what's

So they took to -Like lessees or something,

bailees?

16

MR. PALMORE:

There was no question under

17

the regulatory scheme here that Petitioners were

18

handlers.

19
20

And in fact, there's a surprising -JUSTICE BREYER:

I -- no, no.

I just wanted

to know what the word "acquire" --

21

MR. PALMORE:

"Acquire" -- "acquire" is

22

defined to include a number of things, including to

23

possess.

24

There was no mystery about this.

25

And a handler is anyone who sells raisins.

And, in fact, at pages 8 through 11 of our

Alderson Reporting Company

It sounds

I think the owner would have to assert that

But "acquire" is a defined term, and as this

case comes to this Court it's accepted.

17

has not sought cert on the underlying regulatory

18

findings.

19

ahead of time that they were completely wrong over and

20

over and over again, and then they lost that claim at

21

every level, twice within the Department of Agriculture,

22

in the district court, in the court of appeals.

23

lost on that regulatory claim.

24
25

The Petitioner

In fact, their arguments -- they were told

They

This wasn't a good faith misunderstanding.
If you look at JA41, the ALJ found that this was a

2

requirements because they were able to undercut their

competitors by not playing by the rules.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

So this

No, no. But still, it might

6

if they're acquirers -- but they are acquirers, okay?

7

They think this program is unconstitutional because it

8

takes some other people's property, right?

9

other people are in a very special relation to them.

10

So those

Those other people are really close.

11

And it may be they have standing to assert

13

standing to assert those other people's claims, why

14

can't they make the argument that way?

MR. PALMORE:

I -- I disagree that they have

standing to make those other people's claims.

17

Petitioners haven't argued, haven't made any third-party

strict for third-party standing.

MR. PALMORE:

think that's before the Court.

6

It was a

Their analysis was all correct.

So I

But yes, we -- we frankly acknowledge and we

7

acknowledged in our brief that we did not -- we did

8

suggest below that this was a jurisdictional defect.

9

Ninth Circuit authority said that it was and we relied

10
11

on that.
We now believe that it's best understood not

12

as a jurisdictional defect, but as a substantive defect

13

in the claims, not simply a choice of remedies issue, as

14

Petitioners suggested because choice of remedy suggests

15

that there has been a constitutional wrong and that we

16

need to decide what remedy is going to be available, an

injunction or damages.

reach the merits, which is a very different question?

You got to

MR. PALMORE:

Well, it depends on what you

mean by "merits."

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. PALMORE:

Only if you win, right?

There is the taking -- no.

16

There is the underlying kind of takings claim, that

17

there was -- was there a taking here at all?

18

not before the Court.

19

that that's before the Court.

20

And that's

I don't think anyone suggests

But we do -- we do think that there are a

21

series of other threshold defects in the claim that this

22

Court could -- could rely on.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Palmore.
Mr. McConnell, you have 3 minutes remaining.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. McCONNELL:

I'd like to make two quick

4

points.

One is that I believe that the government has

5

essentially conceded here in this argument and in their

6

brief that the Tucker Act does not apply.

7

told us that the Tucker Act does not apply on page 50

8

and repeated here when Congress could not have

9

contemplated a compensation.

They have

Now, in addition -- and

10

their only answer to that is to say, first, that

11

Congress didn't think it would be a taking, which in

12

Regional Rail, this Court said is not the question.

13

And secondly, that if -- if there's one --

14

we should get paid once, compensation once and then the

15

administrator's going to cancel the program, which is no

16

answer at all.

17

compensation for everybody or it contemplates it for

18

nobody.

19

Either the statute contemplates

I think they have effectively conceded that

20

the Tucker Act does not apply.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

that it doesn't apply to handlers.

23

MR. McCONNELL:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Well, they've conceded

To handlers.

And --

Yes, and so they've

conceded there is no --

MR. McCONNELL:

And the second issue I

2

wanted to talk about so is this capacity issue.

3

Certainly, we have standing.

4

third-party standing.

5

pocket, yes, we have standing.

6

certainly -- and then that is in our capacity as

7

handler.

8
9

When -- it's not

All of the money comes out of our
And secondly, we

Essentially, the Department of Agriculture's
view is that during those couple of days when the

10

raisins are going through our packing plant, that we

11

acquired them and possessed them during those couple of

12

days and that we should have given them their -- their

13

share.

14

time they get around to enforcing that and so forth, the

15

raisins are gone and now the money stands in -- stands

16

in for the raisins.

17

That's raisins, that's not money.

But by the

But that is a taking claim.

We think it's a -- it's a straightforward

18

taking claim under -- under Norwood and Missouri Pacific

19

Railroad, that's a merits question.

20

it is not a problem of capacity.

21

that taking, that taking is in the capacity as a

22

handler.

But in any event,

Whatever might be,

23

Those are my two points.

24

Thank you.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.
