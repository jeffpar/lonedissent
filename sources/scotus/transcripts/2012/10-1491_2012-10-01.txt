MR. HOFFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The plaintiffs in this case received asylum

12

in the United States because of the human rights

13

violations alleged in the complaint.

14

15

violations in U.S. courts because the defendants are

6

But it was not

It was not adjudicated in this

7

case.

Our position, it was waived when it was not

8

raised in a Rule 12 motion.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What effects that

10

commenced in the United States or that are closely

11

related to the United States exist between what happened

12

here and what happened in Nigeria?

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

The -- the only connection

14

between the events in Nigeria and the United States is

15

that the plaintiffs are now living in the United States

16

and have asylum because of those events, and the

17

defendants are here.

18

between the events that took place in the -- in Nigeria

19

and the forum.

20

defendants here was because they are here and because it

21

was possible to get jurisdiction.

22

There's no other connection

The -- the basis for suing the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And just to make it

clear --

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- it's your

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

position -- and I believe it's the position of the

2

United States; I'm not sure -- that if a U.S.

3

corporation commits an international law violation in

4

the United States, that U.S. corporation can be sued in

5

any court in the world?

6

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, it is -- it is possible

7

that other countries would assert jurisdiction.

I think

8

that, generally speaking -- and it might well have been

9

the case in this case had the issues been raised -- most

10

of the time, alternative doctrines like the requirement

11

of personal jurisdiction, or the requirement -- or forum

12

non conveniens or other doctrines would -- would have

13

those cases litigated in other places.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then -- but the way I

15

stated the hypothetical, or the proposition, that is

16

your beginning proposition -- although there might be

17

some defenses.

18

be sued in any country in any court in the world.

19

But as a beginning matter, that they can

Well, I think it would depend

20

on what the events were and what the claims were and --

21

and what the law in that jurisdiction was.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

MR. HOFFMAN:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.
-- as part of the

hypothetical.

4

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yeah.

Well, I think that

5

if -- if, in fact, the U.S. corporation committed a

6

violation of a universal jurisdiction norm, for example,

7

as we believe these norms are in this case, there are

8

many jurisdictions in which U.S. corporations could be

9

-- could be sued.
In fact, in the United Kingdom and -- and

10
11

the Netherlands, I believe their juris -- their

12

provisions enforcing the international criminal court

13

might --

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose, if you

15

have -- I suppose, if you have, as I think there

16

probably is in this case, a number of plaintiffs, they

17

can sue in a number of different countries, right?

18

will sue in the United States, others in the United

19

Kingdom, others in the Netherlands?

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

Some

Well, it -- it is possible

21

that the plaintiffs could have sued in other places.

22

They sued here because this is where they live.

23

their adopted homeland because of that.

This is

The United States, under international law,
clearly has jurisdiction to adjudicate claims between

parties properly before them.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is there some -- is there

3

some super body that decides what constitutes a

4

violation of the particular norms of international law?

5

That is to say, these other countries that have

6

jurisdiction, they decide for themselves, don't they,

7

what -- whether there's been a violation of the

8

international norm or not?

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, if -- if there are

10

proceedings with respect to those norms or violations,

11

yes, they do.

12

I mean in domestic courts, there are

13

international tribunals that have a limited

14

jurisdiction, and they decide.

15

tribunals that decide other cases.

16

national courts have always been engines of decision

17

making on -- on international law.

18

There are some ad hoc

In fact, that's the foundation of this -- of

19

this statute comes from the founders' desire to have

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, it's -- it's unlikely

3

that -- that that would come up, because the suit could

4

be brought in the United States.

5

because, based on most forum non conveniens doctrines,

6

the suit would be heard here, because --

exhaustion of administrative remedies.

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, there is the possibility

10

of exhaustion of local remedies.

11

Union brief suggests that that's part of the

12

international law package that one has to accept.

13

this Court in Sosa did say that it would consider an

14

exhaustion of local remedies doctrine if that was the

15

case.

that situation?
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think the political

question doctrine would clearly apply, and -- and -- and

10

a court would decide whether to go forward.

11

United States believed that -- that the case should be

12

dismissed, as I understand the U.S. position in past

13

cases like Doe v. Exxon, is that -- that there should be

14

interlocutory appeal from -- from a denial of a

light of that.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, but I think what the

20

U.S. position is, and I think -- I think it would -- I

assume it would be accepted -- is that if the United

that it would be able to go up on a Cohen v. --

can't cite a case -- but maybe you can, please do if you

Well, I think that in

Corrie v. Caterpillar, for example, there were alleged

23

human rights violations, and the United States said that

24

25

bulldozers that were involved in that alleged human

rights violation, that the court should dismiss on

2

political question grounds, and the courts did dismiss

on political question grounds.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Couldn't you just say if --

5

would we have the power to say, looking at Sosa and the

6

principles that narrow considerably the subject matter

7

of this statute, to add a requirement that if the State

8

Department says that it interferes with foreign

9

relations it doesn't fall within the statute, can't

10

bring it?

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Well -That would get rid of this

problem, wouldn't it?

14

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, that would get rid of

15

the problem.

16

political question doctrine would work would probably

17

end up being the same when it's that kind of rule.

18
19

I think that in truth, the -- the way the

JUSTICE BREYER:

By the way, did we sign the torture treaty?

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

Yes.

We've ratified --

We've signed the torture

treaty.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

It would be the same thing.

We've ratified -The torture treaty does

provide for -- for what is it called, universal
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurisdiction?

2

MR. HOFFMAN:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So, if in fact

4

a corporation in the United States, in cahoots with the

5

Government or something, should do the unusual thing of

6

violating the torture treaty, Tasmania or any country in

7

the world that signed the torture treaty would have

8

jurisdiction under that treaty to proceed, is that

9

right?

10

MR. HOFFMAN:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

Right.
So the situation that we're

talking about already is in existence.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

That's right.

I mean, there's

14

nothing that the Court would do in this case that would

15

change --

Please explain to me what's wrong

with it.

4

substantive and procedural international law norms; that

5

those norms do permit these foreign-cubed cases only so

6

long as either, it appears to me, the defendant is a

7

citizen of the country, the acts occurred within that

8

country, or the alien has exhausted both domestic and

9

international avenues for relief, a sort of forum by

It basically says you have to borrow both the

10

necessity, which apparently most countries have,

11

including the ones who have submitted amici arguing --

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

14

Right.
-- different points,

like England and The Netherlands.

15

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It seems to me like a

17

fairly simple set of rules clearly defined and limiting

18

the application of this statute in a way that sort of

19

makes sense.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

Well, I think -What's wrong with the

rule?
MR. HOFFMAN:

I don't think there is a lot

24

wrong with the rule, actually.

In a foreign-cubed kind

25

of case, it seems to me the EU position is, number one,
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that there is universal jurisdiction, no matter whether

2

you consider the Federal Commonwealth cause of action

3

prescriptive or not.

4

have agreed that all states have an interest in

5

enforcing these fundamental norms and that's part of

6

international law.

7

are limits of exhaustion of remedies under international

8

law, which guard -- safeguards the interests of third

9

states before the United States can --

And so, the countries of the world

And that -- that what goes with that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

So answer me why is this

11

not the case where on the facts there has been a failure

12

to exhaust.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think that we would --

14

we would -- there's no record, obviously, about that.

15

And one of the arguments we would make about exhaustion,

16

I believe, is that it would have been futile to exhaust

17

under international law -- under international law

18

standards.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Might be -- Nigeria is

20

one question, but other potential forums are the U.K.

21

and the Netherlands.

22

MR. HOFFMAN:

Right.

And I think that we --

23

you know, we have -- if there was an exhaustion of local

24

remedies requirement, then we would have to see if we

25

could satisfy that.

fact, the -- you know, there is a recent Dutch decision

6

that goes perhaps farther than the Alien Tort Statute,

7

the Al Brujaj case.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you would agree, Mr.

Hoffman, that if there were an exhaustion requirement,

10

it would not apply only to Nigeria, but also to the

Netherlands and to the U.K.?

12

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I mean, it depends on

how the Court frames it.

14

requirement under the Torture Victim Protection Act,

15

there are other arguments about what that looks like

16

under international law.

17

follow up on Justice Sotomayor's point, I think that if

18

that's deemed by the Court to be a requirement of

19

international law, then international law rules on

20

exhaustion should apply, and we would either be able to

21

satisfy them or not or take whatever position we would

22

take with respect to that.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, there's the exhaustion

I mean, I think that -- to

Well, the U.K. -- the U.K.

24

MR. HOFFMAN:

5

8

courts of the United States --

9

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well --

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

-- when it has nothing to do

11

with the United States other than the fact that a

12

subsidiary of the defendant has a big operation here?

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, I think this Court in

2

Sosa said that its analysis did not necessarily apply to

3

1331, and I think that's because of the history of 1350.

4

The history of 1350, as the historians'

5

brief lays out, is that the Founders believed that

6

certain law of nations norms could be implemented by

7

common law tort actions.

8

that without further congressional action, the courts of

9

the United States would be available to enforce norms

10
11

And this Court in Sosa found

that were similar to those norms.
And in fact, the norms that the Founders

12

were familiar with were very similar in kind to the

13

universal jurisdiction norms that Justice Sotomayor --

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but -- but general --

15

general common law was not considered to be Federal law,

16

neither Federal law nor state law.

17

every tort action, which in those days were decided

18

under -- under a general law that was up there in the

19

sky, would have been a Federal -- a Federal claim.

20

MR. HOFFMAN:

If that were so,

But there were -- there was

21

certain -- there were certain norms that were believed

22

to be part of the law of nations, including piracy and

23

attacks on ambassadors, and they were governed by

24

universal standards.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Common law.

18
Alderson Reporting Company

It's general

Official

1
2

common law.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, but I think this Court

3

found in Sosa that that -- that that part of common law

4

at the time has become customary international law, and

5

that -- that the courts of this country have not lost

6

their ability to enforce the same kinds of law of

7

nations norms as the Founders wanted to be -- to enforce

8

in the Alien Tort Statute in the context of universal

9

human rights norms.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that isn't the issue.

11

The issue is whether when they do so they are enforcing

12

Federal law or not.

13

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think this Court said that

14

it's the Federal common law within one of the exceptions

15

to Erie and -- and I think this Court, right after Erie,

16

found that there were enclaves of Federal law, one of

17

them being the area of foreign relations, where Federal

18

common law should be viewed as Federal --

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that answer would

20

apply if you were answering Justice Ginsburg's question

21

in the affirmative by saying that there is 1331

22

jurisdiction, but you need not go so far, given Sosa.

23

MR. HOFFMAN:

We don't.

MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, it could be, but what

seems more obvious about the reason for the Alien Tort

Tort Statute claim; he would be sent to the state courts

You point out, I think,

an anomaly.

If the victim is a United States citizen --

you say the only ties here are that the victims got

asylum in the United States, so they are here.

11

someone who is here all the time, someone who is a

victim of one of these atrocities, there would be no

suit for such a person.

the congressional design, and it was -- that arises out

why should we make it?

7

case.

I'm sorry -- I'm sorry.

9

We object -- the United States objected to
the universal civil jurisdiction aspect of the

10

convention against torture.

We have never acceded to

11

that.

12

consequences Justice Kennedy began the argument with.

13

We fear that if we say that a United States court can be

14

open to try any accused law of nations violator for

15

anywhere in the world regardless of the place of the

16

conduct, the other nations of the world might seek to do

-- Your Honor, if you wish to

say no extraterritorial application, we think Sosa does

18

not foreclose that, because Sosa simply said piracy

19

might be one of the -- the actions covered.
But I want to get back to the key point,

20
21

which is --

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I ask this about piracy?

23

In 1789, do you think that Congress was contemplating

24

tort actions against pirates in courts of the United

25

States?
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. SULLIVAN:

No, we do not, Your Honor,

2

because we think that in rem actions were the typical

3

things contemplated.

4

United States v. Palmer comes along, this Court applied

5

the presumption against extraterritorial application of

6

U.S. law to -- the application of the then-extant piracy

7

statute to a foreign-flagged vessel on the high seas.

And as soon as

8

The thought was, don't apply it to the

9

foreign-flagged vessel because that's like a mini-

10

foreign country on the high seas.

11

that the presumption against extraterritoriality

12

actually applied in the founding era even to piracy.

13

So we would argue

But even if you were to say, well, piracy is

14

covered now, it doesn't follow that the norms that are

15

invoked here under the law of nations can be subject to

16

a U.S. civil cause of action.

17

And I want to stress that our point is that

18

the U.S. is projecting here -- and I don't believe

19

through the statute, the ATS, but through the causes of

20

action under Federal common law -- our law onto foreign

21

countries.

MS. SULLIVAN:

The difference it makes is

proper remedy would have been to seek -- for France to

reverse Marbois, you said Congress didn't speak, but I

is theoretically the possibility that if State law

transitory tort didn't work, and if extradition didn't

work, and if the French didn't just seek to punish the

18

assailant in their own country, maybe there would have

19

been international conflict, but there is no evidence

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Pirates could have been

22

sued in State court, too, and yet the ATS -- I know that

you quarrel about whether an act of piracy qualifies as

24

an international norm, but assuming that I accept it is,

25

pirates could have been -- under your theory, pirates

3

MS. SULLIVAN:

But, Your Honor,

4

there is not a single founding era precedent, not a

5

single one, that involves the reverse hypothetical.

6

Every single founding era precedent that stimulated the

7

ATS or came soon in its aftermath involved international

8

law violations alleged to have occurred on U.S. soil or

9

in U.S. waters.
The two cases most soon after the ATS were

If the place of the injury and the place of the last

21

conduct was on foreign soil.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

The Alien Tort Statute should not afford a

cause of action to address the extraterritorial conduct

9

of a foreign corporation when the allegation is that the

10

defendant aided and abetted a foreign sovereign.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

It's my responsibility to

8

balance those sometimes competing interests and make a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

responsibility of your predecessors as well, and they

Well, because we think

they are persuasive, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, okay.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your successors may

adopt a different view.

And I think -- I don't want to

23

put words in his mouth, but Justice Scalia's point means

whatever deference you are entitled to is compromised by

25

the fact that your predecessors took a different

GENERAL VERRILLI:

So, Mr. Chief Justice,

let me be clear:

In this case our position is that the

What result then?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

In that case the possible

risk of foreign relations friction would be comparable.

10

The risk of reciprocal exposure to American companies

11

would also exist.

12

this case, Your Honor, is that there'd be a much more

13

substantial connection to the United States because it's

14

an American company.

15

whether the -- that substantial connection provided a

16

sufficient justification for subjecting the United

17

States company to these international law norms to avoid

undermining the credibility of our Nation's commitment

19

to those norms.

20

question in this case because we think that the Court

21

ought to proceed incrementally here.

22

the Court involves a foreign corporation in which there

23

just isn't any connection to the United States at all,

The difference between that case and

you are disavowing any forum of necessity view of the

ATS?

4

with respect to citizens -- to aliens who are attacked?

You are disavowing what other countries do or say

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Our view about that,

6

Justice Sotomayor, is that the key determinant here, and

7

the reason why there ought not be a cause of action

8

here, is the absence of any meaningful connection to the

9

United States.

And the question is --

I asked you a question

directly.

Are you foregoing -- are you foregoing any

forum necessity exception to the rule you've just

14

absence of any connection to the United States.

there was no doubt that there was an ATS action.

And Attorney General Bradford said

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There was also a U.S.

perpetrator.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, that's true, but with

15

respect to the presumption against extraterritoriality,

16

it wouldn't matter if it is a U.S. perpetrator or not.

17

And it shows exactly why the presumption can't apply

18

because it would undermine the very purposes of the

19

statute in the best available evidence that we have

20

about what it meant in the era.

21

I would like to give a hypothetical that I

22

think reveals why the U.S. Government position should

23

not be accepted.

24
25

Suppose there is -- there is an Iranian
corporation that secretly supplies poison gas to the

7

actually it seems perfectly consistent with Dutch law,

8

it is consistent with the exercise of universal

9

jurisdiction in many pieces of legislation --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I would rather listen to

the Dutch Government than one, one Dutch judge, frankly.
MR. HOFFMAN:

Well, the Dutch Government,

13

though, and one of the significant pieces in this case

14

is that the Nigerian Government doesn't have a position

15

on this case any longer.

16

has never asked for this case to be dismissed on foreign

17

policy grounds.

18

Government have never asked for this case to be -- to be

19

invalidated on foreign policy grounds.

20

their position about what they think the Alien Tort

21

Statute should mean.

22

Union brief, of which the United Kingdom and Dutch are

23

members, the European Union says there is no issue about

24

universal jurisdiction, there is no issue about civil

25

jurisdiction that falls within universal jurisdiction.

Their only argument is that if you accept that, you

should accept international opposition and exhaustion of

local remedies.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And isn't that really the

5

way to reconcile the Dutch positions?

6

objecting because they think they have a fair forum, but

7

when the judges were faced with a case arising from

8

Libya, they thought that there was no fair forum there.

9

And that's the difference, that in one case there was

10

The Dutch are

exhaustion and in the other there wasn't.

11

MR. HOFFMAN:

I think that that's probably

12

what the basis of the Dutch position.

13

though, is that this -- the framework that this Court

14

established in Sosa to -- to take the pirates of the

15

18th century and deal with the Alien Tort Statute with

16

the torturers and those who commit genocide in the 21st

17

century was correct, and that doesn't need a radical

18

re-evaluation as suggested by the Respondents and the

19

United States.

Our position,

20

If there are no further questions, I'd --
