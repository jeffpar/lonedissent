5

States.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. GILLEY

8

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT

9
10

MS. GILLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

There are three primary points I would like

12

to focus on this morning during my argument.

13

question presented by Mr. Henderson involves a very

14

small subset of cases which are -- which come before the

15

Court under Rule 55 -- 52(b) each year.

16

First, the

These are the cases that were referred to as

17

the special case in the Olano decision.

18

errors which, at the time of trial, were unsettled or

19

unclear; but, by the time they made it to the appellate

20

court, they had become clear by a clarifying rule or a

21

decision.

22

Second --

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24

they come up here?

25

it not?

They have

What -- what about the time

52(b) applies to every court, does

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MS. GILLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So suppose there's been --

3

been no objection to a uncertain question of -- on an

4

uncertain question of law until the case gets here.

5

Can -- can counsel argue that this Court should

6

nonetheless review the case because, if we agree with

7

counsel, thereupon, the law would be clear?

8

issued our decision, the law would be clear.

9

MS. GILLEY:

When we

I believe that the Court would

10

have the authority to do that because it says if it is

11

on direct appeal or not yet final.

12

be final unless the time had expired for the petitioner

13

to get to the Supreme Court.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it would not yet

I -- I wonder how we would

15

go about deciding whether we would take such a case or

16

not.

17

says, I didn't -- we didn't raise any of these

18

objections, neither in the court of appeals nor in the

19

district court; but, if you agree -- if you agree with

20

me, Your Honors, that the law is thus and so, once you

21

say that, that will make the decisions below clear

22

error, and, therefore, you should be able to reverse it.

We'd take all -- all those cases where counsel

23

Makes sense, right?

24

MS. GILLEY:

25

Well, I believe the Supreme

Court has, under its own special rules, the -- the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

ability to take an argument in -- a petition that has

2

not been raised before, but on its own could accept it

3

if it is clear at the time --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then what your --

5

your first answer was that this is a very small set of

6

cases that you're dealing with.

7

Justice Scalia is yes, this Court could take a case

8

that's unsettled and, by settling it, make the error

9

plain.

10

If your answer to

That would open the door to a huge number of

cases, wouldn't it?

11

MS. GILLEY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

12

I believe that the provisions to get to the Supreme

13

Court -- frankly, I don't know the answer as to if you

14

had skipped the -- the appellate court, and -- and we're

15

still in that window of time, that transition period

16

after the appellate court had ruled, and only then the

17

clarifying error came, I think you could still come to

18

the Supreme Court.

19

But the very narrow -- the very narrow --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it would be narrow

21

in the sense that substantial rights would have to be

22

affected and the other conditions of Olano met.

23

But I think, consequent on Justice Scalia's

24

question is, that itself would be another issue in every

25

case.

Is this one of those cases:
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Number one, it was

Official

1

wrong; number two, it's new; number three, is it clear

2

under all the Olano criteria.

3

decided in every case.

4

MS. GILLEY:

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that would have to be

Well, Your Honor, I think -So at the end of the day,

6

it could be a small subset of cases, but the number that

7

would be presented, both to this Court and the court of

8

appeals, would be quite substantial.

9

MS. GILLEY:

Well, I think there would be

10

very few that would come directly to the Supreme Court.

11

The vast majority of the cases obviously would come

12

through the circuits.

13

And what I was referring to as a very small

14

subset would be those cases where there is actually an

15

unsettled error -- an unsettled claimed error at the

16

trial.

17

There are very few cases that would come out

18

of the Supreme Court during the period of time of appeal

19

that would allow for the petitioner to -- to say, well,

20

now it's clear.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, this is a -- I

22

mean, the time from the district court decision in this

23

case to today is how long?

24
25

MS. GILLEY:
in 2009.

It's -- well, this case started

My client pled guilty in June of 2010.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's 2 years --

2

in any case in which -- in a typical case in which this

3

happens, you've got 2 years of cases, right?

4

MS. GILLEY:

I think that my -- this case,

5

Mr. Henderson's case, is unusually long.

6

was a year between the time he was sentenced in June of

7

2010 until 2000 -- June of 2011, when Tapia was decided.

8
9

In fact, it

So he was actually waiting between the
period of the trial stage to -- into the Fifth Circuit

10

for over a year before Tapia was even decided, and then

11

several months after that before the Fifth Circuit ruled

12

on the issue.

13

So this is an unusually long period of time.

14

I don't think that that's common.

I think the vast

15

majority of the cases do not come within that

16

transitional period.

17

after Mr. Henderson's case in Escalante-Reyes, they sua

18

sponte had their own -- they called for an en banc in

19

Escalante-Reyes and changed the position that they had

20

in Mr. Henderson's case.

As -- as the Fifth Circuit noticed

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

is the purpose of the Plain-Error Rule?

23

May I ask you what you think

Suppose that it was proposed to amend

24

Rule 52(b) to take out the word "plain," so that the

25

rule would read simply, "an error that affects
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

substantial rights may be considered even though it was

2

not brought to the Court's attention."

3

So what does -- in your judgment, what does

4

the word "plain" add?

5

serve?

6

What -- what purposes does it

MS. GILLEY:

Your Honor, it serves a very

7

important purpose.

And I must say that my understanding

8

of that has evolved considerably since I started

9

researching this issue.
I think it's very important.

10

And it

11

certainly is helpful to -- to the practitioner because

12

when you come to the appellate court, and you say, now,

13

I have a -- a decision, it is now plain, or I have a

14

rule -- a statute, that now makes this plain, it -- it

15

is a very important prong in the Olano --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what purpose does it

17

serve?

18

if there was an error, and it was a really -- it was an

19

error that really badly hurt the defendant, then it can

20

be considered, even though it wasn't raised at whatever

21

time it has to have been -- it wasn't raised, there

22

wasn't an objection?

23

Why should the rule not be that if -- if some --

What purpose does that serve?

MS. GILLEY:

The purpose of -- of 52(b)

24

is -- is a safety belt for the very extreme measures of

25

Rule 51, which says if you -- if you fail to raise
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contemporaneously --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, but I'm not asking

3

why we have -- why we permit plain errors to be raised.

4

I'm asking why do we require that the error be plain in

5

order for it to be considered?

6

Let me suggest two purposes it serves.

7

follows from the adversary system, and it serves

8

judicial efficiency.

9
10

Would you agree with that; those are the
purposes of it?

11
12

It

MS. GILLEY:

I absolutely would.

Yes.

Yes,

Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Does it serve

14

those purposes better as applied at the time of trial or

15

at the time of appeal?

16
17

MS. GILLEY:

The finding, the assessment of

plain error; is that the question you're --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MS. GILLEY:

Yes.

I think that it very much helps

20

to assess and evaluate the plainness of the error at the

21

time of appeal.

22

helpful.

23

both Olano and --

24
25

That -- that is where it can really be

And that, in fact, is what the Court did in

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does it serve -- does it

serve judicial efficiency better to say that we apply
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the Plain-Error Rule at the time of trial or at the time

2

of appeal?

3

MS. GILLEY:

I think that it serves judicial

4

efficiency very much better, as amicus very well stated

5

in his brief, the example of the Ninth Circuit, where,

6

if you don't have plain error, and then the appellate

7

court must go back to the trial level, the trial stage,

8

and determine was this, was this clear at the time of

9

trial?

10

Was it clearly against the defendant?

Was it

clearly --

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if you apply it at the

12

time of trial, it may -- eliminate the need for an

13

appellate court, under some circumstances, to get to the

14

ultimate question of whether there was error; or, it

15

could say, there might have been error, but it wasn't --

16

it's not plain to us, I suppose.

17

efficiency.

18

So you have that

But if you apply it at the time of trial,

19

you avoid retrials.

20

is more consistent with the purpose of serving judicial

21

efficiency?

22

So which is -- which of those two

MS. GILLEY:

Well, I'm not sure that that

23

would be a correct assessment.

I think that the

24

judicial efficiency would be more at the time of appeal

25

because, as many of the circuits have noticed, that's
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

what they are going -- they agree.

2

know, 8 to -- 8 to 2 that they find --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think it's -- you

But when, as is the

4

situation in this case, the law is uncertain at the time

5

of trial, and there are some circuits that have gone one

6

way, some circuits that have gone the other way, surely

7

it greatly serves efficiency to bring that situation to

8

the attention of the judge.

9

He has a 50 percent chance of getting it

10

right.

11

Instead, your -- your client did not raise any

12

objection, and the judge just went ahead.

13

And if he gets it right, then the case is done.

Now, if -- if the error was plain, you can

14

say, well, he didn't need an objection, any -- any dumb

15

judge would have -- would have known this.

16

you make that kind of an exception.

17

reason for making that exception, where you could have

18

brought this to the judge's attention, and he could have

19

solved the problem; or, if he didn't solve it, maybe the

20

prosecutor could have, by making some alteration in what

21

he was demanding as a -- as a punishment or whatever.

22

That -- that seems to me such a -- such a

Okay?

So

But I don't see the

23

clear efficiency in the system.

I don't know what the

24

efficiency is when you do it at the court of appeals

25

level.

All you tell me is that, well, it saves you the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

trouble of going back and figuring out what -- what the

2

situation was at the trial -- at the time of trial,

3

right?

4

anyway to decide whether -- whether substantial rights

5

have been affected, don't you?

But you've got to go back to the time of trial

6
7

MS. GILLEY:

multiple parts to that question.

8
9

Well, I think, Your Honor,

First of all, I think there -- I think that
the cases -- the solicitors, the responders --

10

Respondents have conflated the idea of why we have

11

52(b).

12

judicial system.

13

serious wrong, an injustice that was incurred by the

14

defendant.

It's not primarily for the efficiency of the
It's to -- it's to correct a very

That's the primary purpose of 52(b).
And then, if you look at it the way the

15
16

Court would -- the solicitors would have -- have the

17

Court decide at time of trial, there would be no remedy

18

for --

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But -- but there's -- this

20

brings you back to Justice Alito's question.

There's

21

always an injustice when the district court has gotten

22

it wrong.

23

wrong rule.

The district court got it wrong, applied the
Justice has not been served.

24

But we don't say, we want to do justice.

25

say, we're only going to do justice if it was clear.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

We

Official

1

Now, why -- why would you -- why would you

2

have that limitation on it?

3

that limitation makes sense to me is -- is because when

4

it is clear, it doesn't have to be raised below.

5

judge ought to know better, anyway, and so you're not

6

sacrificing any efficiency.

7

The only -- the only reason

The

But if the whole purpose of it is just to do

8

justice, I don't understand the reason for the clear

9

limitation.

Why should it only be when it's clear?
MS. GILLEY:

10

Well, we have the rules going

11

back to the Atkinson case.

12

happens when we have the very serious Rule 51, if you

13

don't have contemporaneous objection, you're out of

14

luck?
Fortunately, we have the safety belt of

52(b).

And then this Court, looking at the --

18

what -- what was codified from Atkinson, has the

four-prong test.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I suppose one answer to

2

Justice Scalia's question is that, well, if you require

3

an objection, and you have to have a laundry list of

4

everything that might change, but the answer to that,

5

in turn, is, if -- if you use that rationale, then we're

6

just asking the attorney to conceal from the judge

7

every -- everything that's important.

8

MS. GILLEY:

Well --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It would seem to me the

10

laundry list, even though that's perhaps an initial

11

objection to Justice Scalia's concern, is, frankly,

12

preferable to a system where we just don't -- don't talk

13

about what might be clear error.

14

MS. GILLEY:

Well, I think we must talk

15

about clear error.

16

briefing, in my -- in my beginning to the closing brief,

17

and certainly in the amicus brief, which is an excellent

18

source on this point.

19

52(b) in both Olano and Johnson, they looked to the

20

text, that this Court looked to the text of 52(b).

21

the clear error that they looked at was they decided

22

those cases on the basis that the error was clear at the

23

time of trial.

24
25

And -- and I think that in my -- my

When the Court looked at both --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Where in Johnson did

they -- I'm looking at the para -- two paragraphs the

Alderson Reporting Company

Court spent on this in Johnson.

2

the text?

3

Where did they look at

I mean, obviously, they quoted the text, but

4

the analysis seems to me to be based solely on judicial

5

efficiency.

6

MS. GILLEY:

I think -- and -- and I would

7

like to refer to Judge Owens' concurring and dissenting

8

opinion in Escalante-Reyes in the Fifth Circuit.

9

addressed this quite well in three pages of her -- of

She

10

her opinion, where the Justice did, in a unanimous

11

opinion, state in -- let's see, I think footnote 5 --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

I'm looking at

13

where they talked about this particular question, the

14

second prong, as they -- they put it.
MS. GILLEY:

15

Well, I believe that what

16

Justice Rehnquist looked to was the text of --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

Justice, by the way.
MS. GILLEY:

19
20

I'm sorry.

Chief Justice

Rehnquist.

He was the Chief

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It matters to one of

us.

2

MS. GILLEY:

And -- and I noticed in my

3

record that I, in fact, had promoted Justice Clark in my

4

brief, which the errata shows, and so I'm -- I'm not

5

perfect.

6

But the -- Justice Rehnquist looked -- and

7

he talked specifically about looking at -- at 52(b) and

8

saying, "We're not going to expand on it.

9

going to cut it out of new cloth.

10

make new exceptions.

11

is."

12

We're not

We're not going to

We looked for it as -- as -- as it

And I think that was just a couple of lines

13

after acknowledging the fact that the petitioner said,

14

well, it would have been a laundry list, and that's

15

inconvenient, and it's futile, and it's a waste of time.

16

But that, I think, was more of an argument that went

17

along with what the Chief Justice wrote, that we're

18

looking at the text, and it just doesn't make any sense.

19
20
21

We've got Olano that says, at the very
minimum, the error must be clear at the time of appeal.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to go back to

22

Justice Alito's question for a moment because I

23

thought -- and Justice Scalia.

24

brief, you -- you said that their point's a good point.

25

Their point is that the system works in a way that

I thought, in your

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requires the lawyer to object at the trial.

2

And that is an efficiency because the trial judge has to

3

-- has to correct -- he has to -- has an opportunity to

4

correct mistakes.

5

Alright.

He can't be sandbagged.

But, you said, that's theoretically always

6

true, but, in your case, as a practical matter, it's

7

really never true because no lawyer is ever going to

8

think, oh, I would object, but I'm not going to object

9

because maybe the law will become clarified by the

10

Supreme Court, and I'll be able to get a plain error

11

thing on appeal.

12

the unicorn, he doesn't really exist.

The lawyer who thought that is like

13

(Laughter.)

14

Okay.

And you then said, on the other hand,

15

there’s an efficiency on the other side.

16

on the other side is if you don't take your rule, when

17

you get to the court of appeals, you're going to have to

18

decide in real cases whether the law was so clear that

19

the plain error doctrine still does apply at the trial

20

level before.

21

wrong, or it was clear the judge was right, and there is

22

no point to objecting.

23

The efficiency

Either it was clear that the judge was

So now we have to decide, was he clearly

24

wrong, was he clearly right, or was it a middle case.

25

And when you get to real legal cases that have tough
17

issues, you discover that that's a hard question to ask

-- answer case by case, court by court.

Then why should it have to

be plain at the time of appeal?

9

MS. GILLEY:

But the appellate court has the

10

responsibility of applying the law as it is current.

11

That's what the appellate court is directed to do.

12

That's what Atkinson -- that's what -- even what

13

Atkinson said.

14

current.

15

You apply the law at -- as it is

And so what you're doing by interpreting

16

time of trial as a point of determining the clarity

17

of -- of the error, you are completely eliminating the

18

ability for the appellate court to even rule on that

19

question because there will never, ever be a plain error

20

if you apply the time of trial as the point of

21

determining whether it was clear or not.

22

People like Armarcion Henderson would never

23

have an opportunity to -- to have plain error because it

24

would never be clear.

25

We have to have --

JUSTICE ALITO:

You could promote efficiency

that we have in qualified immunity cases, which gives a

clear or go to the -- to the merits of the -- of the

5

argument.

6

efficiency by having that.

7

You could -- that's -- you can serve

But the Plain-Error Rule doesn't do that.

8

In the situation I gave you, the court would say there

9

was an error, it really affected your substantial

10

rights, but we can't say it was plain to us until we

11

decided this case, and, therefore, you get no relief.

12

And -- and maybe there's a reason for that.

13

for you to tell me what the reason for it is.

14

MS. GILLEY:

I'm waiting

Well, the -- the reason would

15

be similar to what Mr. Henderson faced in the

16

three-judge panel.

17

that the error was -- was clear, as far as they -- they

18

know it happened.

19

there was no question about that; but, the fact that it

20

was not clear at the time of trial defeated

21

Mr. Henderson's ability to get relief.

22

The -- the judge -- the panel said

Tapia said it happened, and -- and

So even though the -- the Congress said, you

23

shouldn't put these people in jail for the purpose of

24

rehabilitation, it was clear -- everybody agreed it was

25

wrong, but my client, instead of having the recommended

2

unjust.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's

Was there a reason -- I

think you represented your client at the trial.

5

MS. GILLEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there a reason why you

7

didn't bring this up when the judge imposed that

8

sentence?

9

I mean, there was -- one thing is Tapia;

10

but, before that, there was a statute that says, judge,

11

don't lengthen sentences for purposes of rehabilitation.

12

And you didn't call that statute to the attention of

13

the -- of the judge, did you?

14

MS. GILLEY:

I did not, Your Honor.

And

15

that was a -- I knew that there was -- certainly, I was

16

concerned, and I was -- that the -- the sentence was so

17

much beyond what the sentencing guidelines had -- had

18

recommended.

19

There was -- the situation was I knew that

20

at that point the guidelines were advisory.

MS. GILLEY:

I was not.

In fact, I was not

research, I realized there was only one case that I

could find, In re Sealed out of the District of Columbia

circuit, which had addressed that particular statute.

5

After I went and did my

And so I did file a Rule 35(a) motion

6

timely, eight days after, and asked the trial court,

7

based on 35(82)(a) to please correct that error in the

8

sentencing.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And let me ask you, I

10

don't wish to sidetrack the discussion on the

11

metaphysics of the Plain-Error Rule, because it's

12

important and it's the -- part of the case, but in this

13

case, there wasn't going to be a new trial.

14

wasn't going to be a new jury.

There

It's just the sentence.

Has any argument been made that we should

15
16

have a different rule for sentences than for errors that

17

would require a new -- a complete new trial?

18

MS. GILLEY:

Your Honor, certainly

19

Petitioner has not made that; but, there are so many law

20

review articles out there right now on ways of changing

21

plain-error review, it might --

22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
said that.

Some circuits have even

Some circuits have even said that.

24

MS. GILLEY:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That is -The Second Circuit says

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that if it's a sentencing error, that the amount of

2

substantial rights and the integrity of fairness of the

3

preceding question is a different balance.

4

MS. GILLEY:

That is correct.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you can -- if you lose,

6

you can't get through the door.

If you win, you then

7

have to go on to the next part of it, which says, did

8

the error affect the fairness, integrity or public

9

reputation of judicial proceedings.

10

So if all that's at stake is a resentencing,

11

not much harm is done, and you're more likely to satisfy

12

the fourth.

13

MS. GILLEY:

And the third.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

If what's at stake is a

15

whole new trial and everything, it's probably a little

16

bit harder to satisfy that prong.

17

So it's possible to build what Justice

18

Kennedy was referring to into the present rule, isn't

19

it?
MS. GILLEY:

20
21

It could -- it could be

possible, and it could be --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why is that so?

Why

is that so?

Why does -- does the effect upon the

I don't understand that.

MS. GILLEY:

You're -- you're here
That's a substantial

It is very substantial.

And

7

there's a recent case out of the Eleventh Circuit that I

8

was going to call to the Court's attention, Judge

9

Gorsuch.

And his -- his comment was, "This is such a

10

serious, serious situation when we sentence a man or a

11

woman to a time in prison when Congress says he should

12

not be there.

13

that we should look at."

14

That is one of the ultimate injustices

And -- and I think that's looking at it from

15

the -- having a separate -- separate review system for

16

sentencing certainly might be helpful.

17

certainly be more speedy, although, frankly, in my case

18

it would not have helped Mr. Henderson because it took

19

Tapia a year after my client was sentenced before Tapia

20

was decided.

21

It could

Of course, I think the argument could have

22

been made and I certainly would have made it at the

23

Fifth Circuit if Tapia had not been decided by the time

24

we made it to the Fifth Circuit, I would have argued

25

that it was clear error regardless.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

The statute was

Official

1

very clear in that it was -- it was certainly -- when

2

the Court eventually did look at Tapia, they used the

3

straightforward -- you used the straightforward language

4

of it.

5

But I think that, that the main, the main

6

point -- another point that I did want to make is that

7

by deciding that plainness should be determined at the

8

time of appeal, this Court would be consistent with its

9

holdings in Olano and in Johnson, because in Olano, the

10

Court said it would be, in this case, it is adequate

11

that the error is plain at the time of appeal.

12

In Johnson, the Court said there was, in

13

fact, no error at the time of trial, but it is clear at

14

the time of appeal.

15

text of 52(b), which is on page 1 in my brief, the text

16

of the brief is what the Court relied on and the Court,

17

the Court said that based on that test, it's adequate

18

that the Court find the appeal -- find the error plain

19

at the time of appeal.

And so in both of those cases, the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

5

The contemporaneous --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Was Justice Breyer

7

essentially correct that in most of the cases where an

8

error is not plain at the time of trial that the third

9

and fourth prong of Olano almost always take care of the

10

issue?

I mean, I've been looking for a case in this

11

Court in which more substantial errors than the one that

12

occurred here -- we are going to put aside the fact that

13

I don't see how this Defendant on the third or fourth

14

could ever win, given that he was begging for drug

15

treatment during his sentencing, so how a resentence

16

would affect the fairness or integrity of this

17

proceeding is beyond my understanding.

18

But isn't Justice Breyer right?

19

MR. WALL:

No.

Not in the government's

20

view.

I think it's a question for another day how much

21

work the fourth prong is doing in the lower courts, but

22

I would say in all of these cases, the defendant is

23

claiming that his sentence was lengthened.

24

all of them he will be able to meet the third prong and

25

show that his substantial rights were affected.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

I think in

It

Official

1

becomes a fourth prong question then.

2

And in the Escalante-Reyes case, one of the

3

dissenting opinions attached an appendix in which the

4

Fifth Circuit, in 181 cases, had found that fourth prong

5

met and had found plain error satisfied.

6

think it --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But I would

Well, I would say to you

8

that that's more in keeping with the attitude that

9

Justice Kennedy asked about, which is I think most

10

circuit courts believe the fourth prong is more easily

11

met in sentencing than in trial cases.

12

right about that, that's not an issue we are facing

13

today.

14

MR. WALL:

Whether they are

The Second Circuit has adopted

that rule.

17

meant to serve different purposes.

prongs are looking at harms to the defendant and to the

19

judicial -- the integrity of the judicial proceedings.

The second prong is really designed to do something

different.

22

objection requirement by isolating errors --

23

I don't know that other courts have but it's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why?

The very

24

essence of 52(b) is when you don't make an objection.

25

mean, it's treating two -- it's addressing two different
28
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

situations; A says when you've made an objection, you

2

just have to prove prejudice; and B says you have to

3

prove that substantial rights are affected.

4

MR. WALL:

Oh, no question.

The purpose of

5

that prong is to isolate out one set of errors, obvious

6

errors, from all of the other trial errors that happen

7

every day that are not correctable under Rule 52,

8

debatable errors that even reasonably experienced

9

district court judges and prosecutors might have

10

overlooked in the hustle and bustle of a trial.

11

That second prong is designed to say, "We

12

want," as the Court said in Frady, "obvious egregious

13

errors that the trial court and the prosecutor were

14

derelict in countenancing."

15

worried about incentivizing the defendant to make a

16

contemporaneous objection, because every party in the

17

courtroom should have known and applied the law.

18

Because there we are not as

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Wall, why doesn't

19

that describe this case?

In here is a statute, never

mind Tapia, the statute says to the judge, don't

lengthen the defendant's sentences for purposes of some

22

cure.

23

he surely should have been, the prosecutor shouldn't --

24

wasn't it incumbent on the prosecutor to tell the judge,

Some courts have found that is impermissible
and you should follow those courts, not the courts that

10

have permitted it, I think a fair reading of the

11

sentencing transcript is that the district court was

12

genuinely on the fence here about what to do with this

13

particular defendant and whether to lengthen his

14

sentence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. WALL:

It is then exactly the kind

18

of debatable, open, unsettled legal question that our

19

adversarial system counts on parties to raise every day.

20

And what we do in Rule 52 is we have a narrow safety

21

valve for obvious errors that everyone in the courtroom

22

should have caught.

23

that --

24
25

But I don't think that we can say

JUSTICE BREYER:
mean, that's the question.

Well, what about the -- I
The word "plain" of course

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

refers by and large to an error that the lower court

2

judge should have caught, so you should have objected.

3

But why limit it exclusively to that; that is, you

4

have -- you know, they quote the Schooner, Peggy and

5

Chief Justice Marshall and back to the history of

6

Hammurabi, as far as we know, that sometimes there is a

7

case where just simple fairness, plus the fact that the

8

law is now plain, means that the appellate court should

9

treat this person the same as a thousand others who now

10
11

will be treated according to the new law.
And indeed, you're complicating it even

12

further for the reason that I really meant my question

13

to be aimed at you -- you know.

14

reason that I said that you're going to create

15

distinctions, there will be a case, the fellow is going

16

to go to jail for 50 extra years, the law is plain that

17

he shouldn't, that didn't come about until the appeal.

I mean, in fact, the

18

And here we have six identical people in the

19

circuit where the law was clear one way and they get the

20

new rule's advantage, and six identical people in

21

another circuit where the law was clear the other way

22

and they get the advantage.

23

where the law wasn't clear, he doesn't get the advantage

24

of the new rule.

25

But in the one circuit

Now, that seems pretty unfair, and I could
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

at least make up some cases where it's just a horror.

2

And if that's so, why don't we leave plain with enough

3

wiggle room so that where it's fair, the judge on the

4

Court of Appeals can say, it is now plain and the other

5

things are satisfied so we apply it to the defendant.

6

That's the whole long question that I've got every part

7

of it in there.

8
9

MR. WALL:
all in.

And I'll see if I can get them

So all I can say to you, Justice Breyer, is the

10

same thing the Court has said in Puckett, Dominguez,

11

Benitez, Young, the Rule 52 has an interest in error

12

correction, egregious error correction, no question.

13

But it is balanced against a very important systemic

14

interest in judicial efficiency.

15

horror, that's a necessary corollary of our system --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And far from being a

But, Mr. Wall, your whole

17

argument about judicial efficiency is an incentives

18

argument, and it depends upon the notion that a lawyer

19

is going to change their behavior, a lawyer is going to

20

make an objection that he otherwise wouldn't have made

21

if the rule that Ms. Gilley proposes is accepted.

22

this goes back to what Justice Breyer said earlier.

23

And

I don't know of a lawyer who would say the

24

following to himself:

I'm not going to make this

25

objection because I'm just going to assume that sometime
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

between now and my direct appeal the law is going to

2

change, and it's going to change in my favor, and when

3

it changes, I'm going to be able to make this objection

4

and get over not only prong two but prong three and four

5

of the test, and life will be grand for my client.

6

Now, who is going to say that?

7

MR. WALL:

Justice Kagan, it's not just

8

about incentives.

Even if I granted that the incentives

9

of defendants would be entirely unchanged no matter what

10

rule this Court adopted, and I don't grant that for all

11

the reasons in our brief.

12

But even if I thought that were right, every

13

time a Court of Appeals or this Court issued an

14

intervening decision of criminal law or criminal

15

procedure, a set of defendants who had not raised a

16

claim of that error at trial would come in to the Court

17

of Appeals or this Court with a claim of plain error.

18

And what we would see is a significant shift

19

of judicial resources to plain-error cases, to do

20

fact-intensive third and fourth prong review to consider

21

a set of errors that were never meant to be put on the

22

table under Rule 52(b).

23

valve was designed to do.

24
25

That's not what this safety

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I can -- I can also not

imagine a lawyer who intentionally makes that decision.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

1

That -- that lawyer is a unicorn, I suppose.

2

But I think there are a lot of lawyers who

3

will not be as careful about finding all of the issues

4

that they should bring to the court's attention, perhaps

5

be unaware of a statute that they should have been aware

6

of.

7

If -- if we -- if we adopt the rule that's

8

being urged by the Petitioner here, it does affect

9

attorney behavior for the attorney to know that stuff

10

that he -- he ought to know but doesn't know will --

11

will not be able to be patched up on appeal.

12
13

MR. WALL:

The government agrees with that,

Justice Scalia.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, should the government

15

agree with that really?

16

imagine -- isn't it just as much of a unicorn for an

17

attorney to say, I'm not going to take great care

18

because I think that the law is going to change between

19

now and the appeal, and because I think I'm going to win

20

on prongs two and three -- three and four.

I mean, nobody can think that those

22

circumstances would arise.

They're flukes when they

attorney's intentional conduct or his level of

25

preparation and care.

And so it -- it doesn't affect either the

MR. WALL:

Justice Kagan, I'm not here

2

saying that I think lawyers are sitting in -- in trial

3

courts intentionally going through the kind of thought

4

processes that you describe.

5

that Justice Scalia is talking about is real.

But I think the effect

6

I think, at the margins, which is what we're

7

talking about when we're talking about these incentives,

8

I do think that in cases like this one -- I mean, this

9

is the heartland, where the district court says, I'm

10

going to give you an above-guideline sentence in order

11

for you to take a drug treatment class.

12

Now, defendants all around the country at

13

the time of Petitioner's trial were raising Tapia

14

claims.

This was not some novel legal claim unknown.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

Why -- why was it a Tapia

16

claim?

17

statute says imprisonment is not an appropriate means of

18

promoting correction and rehabilitation?

19

those -- why wasn't it really incumbent on the

20

prosecutor to tell the judge, just read those words?

21

Why wasn't it simply, trial -- trial judge, the

MR. WALL:

Why weren't

So, Justice Ginsburg, I didn't

22

mean by Tapia claim, depending on -- because this Court

23

hadn't issued Tapia.

24

Tapia, where defendants were saying, Section 3582, the

25

statute to which you're pointing, does not permit you,

I mean a claim like the one in

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

district court judge, to do this.
Lots of defendants were making those claims.

3

They were percolating up through the circuits.

4

defendants in the Fifth Circuit were making that claim.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Even

Mr. Wall, why is this

6

whole test, as you're proposing it, dependent on the

7

smartness or not smartness of a particular circuit and

8

the speed with which a particular circuit reaches an

9

issue or doesn't?

10

I mean, this -- basically, what you're

11

saying is we reward the circuits and the judges who

12

don't reach issues, because if the law is unsettled,

13

then if a substantial right is affected, that's so

14

serious that it affects the fairness and integrity of a

15

proceeding, that is not going to result in a reversal.

16

It seems to me that if I'm a district court

17

judge or a circuit court judge or anyone else or a

18

circuit court, I would try to avoid as many issues as I

19

could because there's going to be as little set of

20

reversals as possible.

21

MR. WALL:

Justice Sotomayor --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And going back to what

23

of the system on the nature of the error?

unnecessary because there was governing law which

Whoa, whoa.

I mean, I think you'd have a stronger
argument were it not for Johnson.

But Johnson is

saying, look, if you're in a circuit where the law turns

11

out to be absolutely clearly wrong, then you don't have

12

to make an objection.

appeal.

And then what we do is we

Now, once I see that, it's like both

about how clear the law is one way or the other, which

is going to be tough.

21

You don't have to make the objection, and the

But, more importantly, it seems to me what's

happening is that 52 is being also used in part to

isolate those Peggy Schooner type cases where it is just

your theory.

4

MR. WALL:

I think Johnson -- as the Chief

5

Justice pointed out earlier, the analysis in Johnson,

6

is fairly brief.

7

history of the rule or this Court's previous cases.

8

The Court did not discuss the text,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, more than that,

9

Johnson stood on its head, did it not, not to decide the

10

case the easy way, which was simply to say if it's clear

11

on appeal, the rule applies.

12

It could have said that.

The case would

13

have been very easy.

It -- it instead avoided that by

14

saying, oh, well, this is a very special case.
Well, it wouldn't be a special case if -- if

15
16

the argument presented by the Petitioner here were

17

accepted.

18

that Johnson supports Petitioner's case, I think Johnson

19

tends to undermine it.

20

I don't -- far from -- far from appearing

MR. WALL:

Well, in danger of running afoul

21

of Justice Kagan, I'm going to agree again.

22

exactly the government's argument.

23

24

aside the -- the question here.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's

If Johnson had

Well, the government had a

different argument before.

2

In Johnson, the government called this

3

distinction an amorphous one.

4

the text of Rule 52(b) contemplates or permits any such

5

distinction.

6

It is more faithful to the text of Rule 52(b) and simpler

7

for the courts of appeals to obviate that distinction

8

altogether," said the government.

9

MR. WALL:

10

And it says, "Nothing in

this passage, you being the government, which is should

And you very clearly stated, both as to a matter of text

17

and to a matter of what's simpler for the courts of

18

appeals, that there should be no such distinction.

19

MR. WALL:

And the question before us

Justice Kagan, there is no

20

question that in the briefs and in argument, the

21

government in Johnson asked this Court not to draw a

22

futility exception to Rule 52 for cases in which an

23

objection would have been pointless at trial in light of

24

governing precedent, and the Court disagreed with us on

25

that.
40
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And the question here is, is the Johnson

2

tail going to wag the plain-error dog?

Johnson rested

3

on a policy consideration.

4

inapplicable here.

5

which a contemporaneous objection could have been quite

6

helpful.

7

case in which the defendant was being asked to make an

8

objection that the District Court was powerless to

9

grant.

They're just flatly

This is the heartland of cases in

This is not, as the Court said in Johnson, a

The District Court here, I think, was

10
11

genuinely on the fence about what to do, and an

12

objection could have been quite helpful.

13

I mean, either the holding in Johnson, which was limited

14

and could not have been if the Court had decided on a

15

broader ground, or the rationale.

16

rationale, that doesn't apply here.

17

So to take --

Even taking just the

I think the only way you could read Johnson

18

that would help Petitioner is to say it resolved the

19

broader question of what the text of the rule requires

20

regardless of context.

21

Johnson that's just not persuasive on the face of the

22

opinion.

23

And that's the one reading of

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but the -- the – well,

24

this -- I mean, the trouble is you've run into, like,

25

four different interpretations of what Johnson really
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

means.

And mine, which is, perhaps, no better or worse

2

than the competing ones, is -- is you go back to the

3

Schooner Peggy, and you see the Chief Justice, and he says,

4

in a case the law has changed, the Court must decide,

5

according to existing law, the appellate court; and, if it

6

be necessary to set aside a judgment rightful when rendered,

7

but which cannot be affirmed, but in violation of the law,

8

that judgment must be set aside.

9

So there, we seem to be -- and Johnson

10

seemed to me to bear this out; but, sometimes, you do

11

forgive the need to object because the overriding

12

principle is the principle of deciding the law as it is

13

at the time of appeal, and to do the contrary is just

14

too unfair.

15
16

Now, that -- reading Johnson that way, I'd
say, well, that rule applies here too.

17

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. WALL:

concern animated this Court's decision -- retroactivity

42

Alderson Reporting Company

As

Justice Alito pointed out --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Absolutely.

I mean,

3

that -- that argument applies to whether the error was

4

plain or not.

5

Apply the law as it is.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

Yes.

And that's why

6

you make a balance.

And the balance goes -- brings back

7

the first question that I put.

8

a case where the law is unsettled, we have what we'll

9

call the uniform or the hippogriff problem, and that's

Because, in this kind of

10

the problem of it doesn't really make that much

11

difference to the basic policy of objecting.

12

And on the other side, you have the

13

administrative potential mess of having to figure out

14

how clear was the law in the court -- the district

15

court.

16

absolutely -- is pretty clear that they were right?

17

was it a circuit where it's pretty clear that the law

18

was the opposite, in which case we waive the need?

19

is it actually mixed up and you don't know, in that

20

circuit, in which case you're arguing, don't waive the

21

need.

22

administrative problem on the other.

23

Is it a circuit where you'd say the law was
Or

Or

So I see the unicorn on one side versus an

MR. WALL:

So I -- I want to suggest that

24

the administerability problem is very small because it

25

has not been difficult for the lower courts to apply
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this test.

2

And I want to suggest that there is a really

3

significant cost on the other side, which is you're

4

putting on the table an entire set of errors that Rule

5

52 was not designed to remedy, and you are diverting the

6

resources of the judicial system toward those

7

plain-error cases, and you will see a set of such claims

8

every time a court of appeals or this Court issues a

9

decision of criminal law or criminal procedure.

In just

10

this circuit alone, it has issued five opinions in the

11

last year considering just Tapia plain-error claims.

12

And that's just Tapia.

13

And that's just one circuit.

And I think the question is, what's the

14

obvious prong designed to do?

15

it's got to be there to catch something.

16

there to screen out are errors that were debatable, that

17

even reasonable district court judges and prosecutors

18

might have missed and catch errors that everyone in the

19

courtroom should have recognized because they were

20

egregious under the law as it stood at the time.

up, but we have a rule -- the Supreme Court has a

17

rule -- and I would like to know how the government

18

reads it.

19

may consider plain error not covered in the questions

20

presented, but evident from the record.

It's our Rule 24, that says we, this Court,

21

Is our rule -- in your view, must the error

22

be plain at the trial court stage, or is it enough that

23

the error was plain at the court of appeals stage for us

24

to apply our rule?

25

MR. WALL:

I don't think there's anything
54

about the text or history or the way that rule has been

used that suggests it should be interpreted differently

from Rule 52.
