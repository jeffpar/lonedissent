Mr. Rein?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERT W. REIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. REIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Almost 4 years ago, eight Justices of the

12

Court agreed the 2005 25-year extension of Voting Rights

13

Act Section 5's preclearance obligation, uniquely

14

applicable to jurisdictions reached by Section 4(b)'s

15

antiquated coverage formula, raised a serious

16

constitutional question.

17

Those Justices recognized that the record

18

before the Congress in 2005 made it unmistakable that

19

the South had changed.

20

remedial needs justified the extraordinary federalism

21

and cost burdens of preclearance.

22

They questioned whether current

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

May I ask you a

23

question?

24

some question about that, that some portions of the

25

South have changed, your county pretty much hasn't.

Assuming I accept your premise, and there's

3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. REIN:

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I -In -- in the period

3

we're talking about, it has many more discriminating --

4

240 discriminatory voting laws that were blocked by

5

Section 5 objections.

6
7

There were numerous remedied by Section 2
litigation.

8
9

You may be the wrong party bringing this.
MR. REIN:

Well, this is an on-face

challenge, and might I say, Justice Sotomayor --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's the standard.

11

And why would we vote in favor of a county whose record

12

is the epitome of what caused the passage of this law to

13

start with?

14

MR. REIN:

Well, I don't agree with your

15

premises, but let me just say, number one, when I said

16

the South has changed, that is the statement that is

17

made by the eight Justices in the Northwest Austin case.

18

And I certainly --

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Congress -- Congress

20

said that, too.

21

any side of this issue who doesn't admit that huge

22

progress has been made.

23

in line with Justice Sotomayor's question, in the D.C.

24

Court of Appeals, the dissenting judge there, Judge

25

Williams, said, "If this case were about three States,

Nobody -- there isn't anybody in -- on

Congress itself said that.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official

1

Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama, those States have

2

the worst records, and application of Section 5 to them

3

might be okay."

4

MR. REIN:

Justice Ginsburg, Judge Williams

5

said that, as he assessed various measures in the

6

record, he thought those States might be distinguished.

7

He did not say, and he didn't reach the question,

8

whether those States should be subject to preclearance.

9

In other words, whether on an absolute basis, there was

10

sufficient record to subject them --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But think about this State

12

that you're representing, it's about a quarter black,

13

but Alabama has no black statewide elected officials.

14

If Congress were to write a formula that looked to the

15

number of successful Section 2 suits per million

16

residents, Alabama would be the number one State on the

17

list.

18

If you factor in unpublished Section 2

19

suits, Alabama would be the number two State on the

20

list.

21

actions, Alabama would again be the number two State on

22

the list.

If you use the number of Section 5 enforcement

23

I mean, you're objecting to a formula, but

24

under any formula that Congress could devise, it would

25

capture Alabama.

MR. REIN:

Well, if -- if I might respond

because I think Justice Sotomayor had a similar

3

question, and that is why should this be approached on

4

face.

5

that have addressed the Voting Rights Act preclearance

6

and the formula, they've all been addressed to determine

7

the validity of imposing preclearance under the

8

circumstances then prevailing, and the formula because

11

12

State of Alabama.

13

any reluctance upon on this --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I -- I don't think that there's

But facial challenges

15

are generally disfavored in our law.

16

question becomes, why do we strike down a formula, as

17

Justice Kagan said, which under any circumstance the

18

record shows the remedy would be congruent,

19

proportional, rational, whatever standard of review we

20

apply, its application to Alabama would happen.

21

MR. REIN:

And so the

There -- there are two separate

22

questions.

One is whether the formula needs to be

23

addressed.

In Northwest Austin, this Court addressed

24

the formula, and the circumstances there were a very

25

small jurisdiction, as the Court said, approaching a
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

very big question.

2

It did the same in Rome, the City of Rome.

3

It did the same in Katzenbach.

4

itself is the reason why Shelby County encounters the

5

burdens, and it is the reason why the Court needs to

6

address it.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The -- so the formula

Interestingly enough, in

8

Katzenbach the Court didn't do what you're asking us to

9

do, which is to look at the record of all the other

10

States or all of the other counties.

11

concentrated on the record of the two litigants in the

12

case, and from that extrapolate -- extrapolated more

13

broadly.

14

MR. REIN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It basically

I don't think that -You're asking us to do

16

something, which is to ignore your record and look at

17

everybody else's.

18

MR. REIN:

I don't think that's a fair

19

reading of Katzenbach.

20

did was examined whether the -- the formula was rational

21

in practice and theory.

22

while we don't have evidence on every jurisdiction

23

that's reached by the formula, that by devising two

24

criteria, which were predictive of where discrimination

25

might lie, the Congress could then sweep in

In Katzenbach, what the Court

And what the Court said is,

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jurisdictions as to which it had no specific findings.

2

So we're not here to parse the

3

jurisdictions.

4

because in and of itself it speaks to old data, it isn't

5

probative with respect to the kinds of discrimination

6

that Congress was focusing on and it is an inappropriate

7

vehicle to sort out the sovereignty of individual

8

States.

9

We are here to challenge this formula

I could tell you that in Alabama the number of

10

legislators in the Alabama legislature are proportionate

11

to the number of black voters.

12

registration and turnout of black voters in Alabama.

14

of the rationality in theory and practice in the

formula.

16

There's a very high

Well, I think that if -- if

Congress has the power to look at jurisdictions like

10

Shelby County, individually and without regard to how

11

they stand against other States -- other counties, other

12

States, in other words, what is the discrimination here

13

among the jurisdictions, and after thoroughly

14

considering each and every one comes up with a list and

15

says this list gravely troubles us, that might present a

16

vehicle for saying this is a way to sort out the covered

17

jurisdictions --

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose Congress passed a

19

law that said, everyone whose last name begins with A

20

shall pay a special tax of $1,000 a year.

21

that tax is challenged by somebody whose last name

22

begins with A.

23

that for some reason this particular person really

24

should pay a $1,000 penalty that people with a different

25

last name do not pay?

And let's say

Would it be a defense to that challenge

9
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. REIN:

No, because that would just

2

invent another statute, and this is all a debate as to

3

whether somebody might invent a statute which has a

4

formula that is rational.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I was about to ask a

similar question.

could have enacted a different statute which he would

No, I agree with you.
The problem with those

14

hypotheticals is obvious that it starts from a predicate

that the application has no basis in any record, but

there's no question that Alabama was rightly included in

done to earn its place on the list.

3

It's a real record as to what Alabama has

MR. REIN:

Justice Sotomayor, with all

4

respect, the question whether Alabama was properly

5

placed under the act in 1964 was -- it was answered in

6

Katzenbach because it came under a formula then deemed

7

to be rational in theory and in practice.

8
9

There's no independent determination by the
Congress that Alabama singly should be covered.

10

Congress has up -- you know, has readopted the formula

11

and it is the formula that covers Alabama and thus

12

Shelby County --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, the reason for the

14

formula -- of course, part of the formula looks back to

15

what happened in 1965.

16

jurisdiction that did engage in testing and had low

17

turnout or -- or low registration?

18

of Alabama today.

And it says are you a

19

MR. REIN:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, that isn't true

That's correct.

That's correct.

So when Congress in fact

21

reenacted this in 2005, it knew what it was doing was

22

picking out Alabama.

23

Alabama, even though the indicia are not -- I mean, even

24

though they're not engaging in that particular thing.

25

But the underlying evil is the discrimination.

It understood it was picking out

11
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official

1

closest analogy I could think of is imagine a State has

2

a plant disease and in 1965 you can recognize the

3

presence of that disease, which is hard to find, by a

4

certain kind of surface movement or plant growing up.

5

Now, it's evolved.

So by now, when we use

6

that same formula, all we're doing is picking out that

7

State.

8

9

But we know one thing:

The disease is still

Because this is a question of
And so the

10

question I guess is, is it rational to pick out at least

11

some of those States?

12

Sotomayor's question, as long as it's rational in at

13

least some instances directly to pick out those States,

14

at least one or two of them, then doesn't the statute

15

survive a facial challenge?

16

MR. REIN:

And to go back to Justice

That's the question.

Thank you.

Justice Breyer, a

17

couple of things are important.

18

Northwest Austin, an opinion you joined, "Current needs

19

have to generate the current burden."

20

in 1965 in Alabama, that Alabama itself has said was a

21

disgrace, doesn't justify a current burden.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Court said in

So what happened

But this is then the

23

question, does it justify?

24

question of rewriting the statute.

25

of renewing a statute that by and large has worked.

I mean, this isn't a

MR. REIN:

some degree.

7

That's the question of rationality.

MR. REIN:

Isn't

If you base it on the findings of

I could take the decision in City of Rome, which
We had a huge problem at the

10

first passage of the Voting Rights Act and the Court was

11

tolerant of Congress's decision that it had not yet been

12

cured.

13

There were vestiges of discrimination.
So when I look at those statistics today and

14

look at what Alabama has in terms of black registration

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, the reason

12

Section 5 was created was because States were moving

13

faster than litigation permitted to catch the new forms

14

of discriminatory practices that were being developed.

15

As the courts struck down one form, the States would

find another.

secondary or primary.

19

And basically, Justice Ginsburg calls it

I don't know that I'd call anything
Discrimination is discrimination.

And what Congress said is it continues, not

20

in terms of voter numbers, but in terms of examples of

21

other ways to disenfranchise voters, like moving a

22

voting booth from a convenient location for all voters

23

to a place that historically has been known for

24

discrimination.

And in Katzenbach, the Court said we're

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And in 1986 -- or excuse me,

Alderson Reporting Company

1

very substantial record, a 15,000-page legislative

2

record, talked about what problems had been solved,

3

talked about what problems had yet to be solved, and

4

decided that, although the problem had changed, the

5

problem was still evident enough that the act should

6

continue.

7

It's hard to see how Congress could have

8

developed a better and more thorough legislative record

9

than it did, Mr. Rein.

10

MR. REIN:

Well, I'm not questioning whether

11

Congress did its best.

12

Congress found was adequate to invoke this unusual

13

remedy.

The question is whether what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indeed, Congress must have

15

found that the situation was even clearer and the

16

violations even more evident than originally because,

was 98 to nothing.

21

that the old disease, limiting people's right to register

22

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm sorry.

It had already evolved away from that, or

MR. REIN:

I beg your pardon, but I think,

Justice Sotomayor, that this Court has never decided

10

that the Fifteenth Amendment governs vote dilution.

11

has said the Fourteenth Amendment does, but the original

12

enactment was under the Fifteenth Amendment.

13

Well, the Fifteenth

Amendment says "denial or abridgement."

15

"abridgement" mean except for dilution?

MR. REIN:

What would

Well, "abridgement" might mean,

17

for example, I let you vote in one election, but not in

18

another; for example, separate primary rules from

20

Abridgement can be done in many ways.

I think dilution is a different concept.

21

We're not saying that dilution isn't covered by the

22

Congress has to treat each State with equal

that does not protect the equal dignity of the States.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Rein, the formula

15

that -- that is applied right now, under that formula

covered jurisdictions, which have less than 25 percent

17

of the nation's total population, they account for

18

56 percent of all successful published Section 2

19

lawsuits.

If you do that on a per capita basis, the

21

successful Section 2 lawsuits, four times higher in

22

covered jurisdictions than in noncovered jurisdictions.

district shouldn't be covered, maybe this one should be

covered.

fallacies, Justice Kagan, in -- in that statement.

Congress has developed this formula and has continued it

in use that actually seems to work pretty well in

targeting the places where there are the most successful

Section 2 lawsuits, where there are the most violations

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
There's a fundamental point that needs to be

made at the outset.

14

its amici, this Court in Northwest Austin, that the

15

Voting Rights Act made a huge difference in transforming

16

the culture of blatantly racist vote suppression that

characterized parts of this country for a century.

18

Everyone acknowledges, Petitioner,

Section 5 preclearance was the principal

19

engine of that progress.

20

that only a tiny fraction of submissions under Section 5

21

result in objections.

22

that follows from that has been as a result of the

23

deterrence and the constraint Section 5 imposes on

24

States and subjurisdictions and not on the actual

25

enforcement by means of objection.

And it has always been true

these under-the-radar screen changes, the polling places

21

and registration techniques, et cetera.

22

those I submit, Your Honor, the -- the cost-benefit

23

ratio is going to be, given the cost of this litigation,

24

which one of the -- one of the reasons Katzenbach said

25

Section 5 was necessary, is going to tilt strongly
37

I think

And in most of

against bringing these suits.

2

Even with respect to the big ticket items,

3

the big redistrictings, I think the logic Katzenbach

4

holds in that those suits are extremely expensive and

5

they typically result in after-the-fact litigation.

6

Now, it is true, and the Petitioners raised

7

the notion that there could be a preliminary injunction,

8

but I really think the Petitioner's argument that

9

Section 2 is a satisfactory and complete substitute for

10

Section 5 rests entirely on their ability to demonstrate

11

that preliminary injunctions can do comparable work to

12

what Section 5 does.

13

that.

14

tell you that the Civil Rights Division tells me that

15

it's their understanding that in fewer than one-quarter

16

of ultimately successful Section 2 suits was there a

17

preliminary injunction issued.

18

They haven't made any effort to do

And while I don't have statistics for you, I can

So I don't think that there's a basis,

19

certainly given the weighty question before this Court

20

of the constitutionality of this law, to the extent the

21

argument is that Section 2 is a valid substitute for

22

Section 5, I just don't think that the -- that the

23

Petitioners have given the Court anything that allows

24

the Court to reach that conclusion and of course --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

Then why shouldn't it apply

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, because I think

8

Congress made a reasonable judgment that the problem --

9

that in 2006, that its prior judgments, that there --

10

that there was more of a risk in the covered

11

jurisdictions continued to be validated by the Section 2

12

evidence.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you do really think

14

there was -- that the record in 2006 supports the

15

proposition that -- let's just take the question of

16

changing the location of polling places.

18

bigger problem in Arizona than Nevada, or in the Bronx

That's a

I think the combination

21

of the history, which I concede is not dispositive, but

22

is relevant because it suggests caution is in order and

23

that's a reasonable judgment on the part of Congress,

24

the combination of that history and the fact that there

25

is a very significant disproportion in successful

Section 2 results in the covered jurisdictions as

2

compared to the rest of the country, that Congress was

3

justified in concluding that there -- that it -- there

4

was reason to think that there continued to be a serious

5

enough differential problem to justify --

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the statistics that I

7

have before me show that in, let's say the 5 years prior

8

to reauthorization, the gap between success in Section 2

9

suits in the covered and the non-covered jurisdiction

10

narrowed and eventually was eliminated.

11

with that?

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Do you disagree

Well, I think the --

13

the -- you have to look at it, and Congress

14

appropriately looked at it through a broader -- in a --

15

in a broader timeframe, and it made judgments.

16

think that actually, the -- the right way to look at it

17

is not just the population judgment that Mr. Rein was

18

critical of, the fact is, and I think this is in the

on the disparate Section 2 rate, based on the

that there was a continuing need.

14

consequences that flow from it.

15

Shelby County or Alabama ought to be able to bring a

16

successful facial challenge against this law on the

17

basis that it ought not to have covered Arizona or

18

Alaska.

19

jurisdictions can try to avail themselves of it.

understand the distinction between facial and as-applied

when you are talking about a formula.

3

Shelby County, they are covered because of the formula,

4

so they're challenging the formula as applied to them.

5

And we've heard some discussion.

I'm not even sure what

6

your position is on the formula.

Is the formula

7

congruent and proportional today, or do you have this

8

reverse engineering argument?

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Congress's decision in

the enforcement power that the Constitution gives to the

17

in which Congress is given a power which is expressly

given to it to act upon the States in their sovereign

6

That's the

The second point is I do -- I do say with

7

all due respect, I think it would be extraordinary to --

8

to look behind the judgment of Congress as expressed in

the statutory findings, and -- and evaluate the judgment

10

of Congress on the basis of that sort of motive

11

analysis, as opposed to --

any sense.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I'm --

And -- but -- but I do

17

think that the deference that Congress is owed, as City

18

of Boerne said, "much deference" -- Katzenbach said

19

"much deference."

20

of the nature of the power that has been conferred here

21

and because, frankly, of the superior institutional

22

competence of Congress to make these kinds of judgments.

23

These are judgments that assess social conditions.

24

These are predictive judgments about human behavior and

25

they're predictive judgments about social conditions and

That deference is appropriate because

49
Alderson Reporting Company

human behavior about something that the people in

2

Congress know the most about, which is voting and the

3

political process.

4

And I would also say I understand your point

5

about entrenchment, Justice Scalia, but certainly with

6

respect to the Senate, you just can't say that it's in

7

everybody's interests -- that -- that the enforcement of

8

Section 5 is going to make it easier for some of those

9

Senators to win and it's going to make it harder for

10

some of those Senators to win.

19

there is a federalism interest in each State being

21

22

proper and a constitutional way.

But if -- if Alabama wants

2

5

independent sovereign or if it's under the trusteeship

6

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Of course it would be

8

better in the former situation.

9

respect, Your Honor, everyone agrees that it was

10

appropriate for -- for Congress to have exercised this

11

express constitutional authority when it did in 1965,

12

and everybody agrees that it was the -- was the exercise

13

of that authority that brought about the situation where

14

we can now argue about whether it's still necessary.

15

And the point, I think, is of fundamental

16

importance here is that that history remains relevant.

17

What Congress did was make a cautious choice in 2006

18

that given the record before it and given the history,

19

the more prudent course was to maintain the deterrent

20

and constraining effect of Section 5, even given the

We're defending it as a facial challenge,

12

because they are able to point out that there may be

13

some other jurisdictions that ought not to be

14

appropriately covered, and that's especially true

15

because there is a tailoring mechanism in the statute.

What we've seen in Section 2 cases is that

6

the benefits of discrimination vest in incumbents who

would not be there, but for the discriminatory plan.

8

And Congress, and specifically in the House Report, I

Once you take away the formula, if you think

1

question is, is Congress remedying something or is it

2

creating a new right.

3

getting to, is Congress trying to go -- do an

4

end-around, a back doorway to expand the Constitution.

5

We know in this area Congress is trying to implement the

6

Fifteenth Amendment and the history tells us something

7

about that.

That's essentially what Boerne is

But specifically to the question -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the Fifteenth

Amendment is limited to intentional discrimination, and,

10

of course, the preclearance requirement is not so

11

limited, right?

12

MR. ADEGBILE:

That's correct.

But this

13

Court's cases have held that Congress, in proper

14

exercise of its remedial powers, can reach beyond the --

15

the core of the intentional discrimination with

16

prophylactic effect when they have demonstrated that a

17

substantial problem exists.

18

The -- the two things that speak to this

19

issue about the disparity in coverage and continuing to

20

cover these jurisdictions, there are two major inputs.

21

The first is the Section 5 activity.

22

activity shows that the problem persists.

reach the next discriminatory thing.

1

Section 5 activity may show that there's a problem in

2

the jurisdictions covered by Section 5, but it says

3

nothing about the presence or absence of similar

problems in noncovered jurisdictions, isn't that right?

MR. ADEGBILE:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. ADEGBILE:

Absolutely, Justice Alito.
All right.
And so I come to my second

8

category.

of the Voting Rights Act that has national application,

The second category, of course, is the piece

Section 2.

11

and it was before Congress, is that the concentration of

Section 2 successes in the covered jurisdictions is

13

substantially more.

times more adjusting for population data.

15

And what the evidence in this case shows,

Justice Kagan said that it was four

The fact of the matter is that there is

16

another piece of evidence in the record in this case

17

where Peyton McCrary looks at all of the Section

18

19

sense, that the Ellen Katz study pointed to dramatically

MR. ADEGBILE:

What we see in the evidence

11

is that of the top eight States with section --

12

favorable Section 2 outcomes, seven of them, seven of

13

them are the covered jurisdictions.

14

bailed in under the other part of the mechanism that, as

15

Justice Kennedy points out, can bring in some

16

jurisdictions that have special problems in voting.

17

so we think that that points to the fact that this is

18

not a static statute, it's a statute that is --

JUSTICE BREYER:

better record than some of the States that are out.

level you have to look piece by piece, State by State.
