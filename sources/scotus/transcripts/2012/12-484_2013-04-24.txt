CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Our last case of the

Center v. Nassar.

Mr. Joseffer?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL L. JOSEFFER

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JOSEFFER:

Good morning, and may it

please the Court:
This Court's decision in Gross does most of

12

the work in this case, and the plain language of the

13

1991 amendments to Title VII do the rest.

14

Under Gross, Nassar must prove that

15

retaliation was the but-for cause of the challenged

16

employment action, unless Congress has specifically

17

relieved him of that burden by authorizing a mixed

18

motive claim.

19

In the 1991 amendments, however, Congress

20

authorized mixed motive treatment only for Title VII

21

claims that challenge -- that challenge discrimination

22

based on membership in a protected class, not for

23

retaliation claims, and, for that reason, a Title VII

24

retaliation claim must prove but-for causation.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the -- in the age

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discrimination context, there wouldn't be a difference

2

between the discrimination claim itself and the

3

retaliation.

4

They'd both be governed by the same

5

standard, isn't that right, in the age discrimination

6

area, the but-for causation.

7
8

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yeah.

Well, the Age Act does

not permit any mixed motive claims.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10
11

Or am I wrong about that?

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

So, for this purpose in the

Age Act, everything is but-for, that's correct.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But your argument is

13

that, in Title VII, where it's very clear what the

14

standard Congress wants to have for the discrimination

15

claim, you're going to have a different standard for

16

retaliation.

17

So, in these statutes, I thought these two

18

traveled together, whatever the standard is for

19

discrimination is the same for retaliation.

20

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, that -- I mean, to some

21

extent, within Title VII, that is the question in the

22

case, but what we have here is an amendment within Title

23

VII.

24

discrimination based on class and discrimination based

25

on retaliation as separate types of discrimination, and

It is first in Title VII, where it's set forth

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

this provision treats them differently.

2

It specifically limits the --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess the question,

4

Mr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination

5

statute in which one can say that there's a different

6

standard for proving retaliation than there is for

7

proving substantive discrimination?

8

of survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the

9

standard is, the standard is the same for both, and

10

Because, as I sort

there's no statute in which the two have been divorced.

11

Am I wrong about that?

12

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, I mean -- the reason I

13

answer the question -- I would agree, in the sense that

14

if what we're talking about is but-for versus mixed

15

motive, right?

16

for within the meaning of this one amendment.

17

clearly intended to make an exception here to the normal

18

but-for, so the question is to the scope of it.

It's -- it's but-for everywhere, except
Congress

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

Is there any other statute in which we have

I'll try again.

21

a different standard of causation for a retaliation

22

claim than we do for a substantive discrimination claim?

23
24
25

MR. JOSEFFER:

No, because it's but-for

everywhere, except for this one amendment.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, is there -- I mean,
5

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's but-for everywhere.

2

Is there even any time at which whatever the

3

standard that applied -- you know, pre-Gross, is there

4

ever a moment and is there ever a statute in the history

5

of antidiscrimination laws, where there has been a

6

divorce -- a different standard for retaliation than for

7

substantive discrimination?

8
9

MR. JOSEFFER:

Not -- I can't point to

anything specific because what we had, right,

10

was -- there was -- I can't point to anything specific

11

on that.

12

Up until the statute, the whole point of

13

Gross, right, is that the statute carves out a narrow

14

exception from but-for and --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All I'm saying is -- you know,

16

Gross was a couple of years ago.

17

the -- the ADA and outside Title VII -- you know, we've

18

had a lot of discrimination statutes since 1964.

19

had a lot of different standards applying to those

20

discrimination statutes since 1964.

It said but-for covers

We've

21

And you're coming in here and asking for the

22

first time, in all of those many decades, that we should

23

divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive

24

discrimination claim and make them follow two different

25

standards; is that correct?
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, I mean, yes and no, in

2

the sense that, if we're talking about but-for versus

3

mixed, right, yes, that's a creature of this specific

4

statute we're talking about.

5

If we're talking about other aspects of

6

retaliation and other types of discrimination, there are

7

differences in the statutes.

8

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Did this court ever hold

that the Price Waterhouse framework applied to retaliation
claims?
MR. JOSEFFER:

No.

And the -- I mean, the

12

backdrop here, which is the whole point of Gross, right,

13

is that, as of Price Waterhouse, we had -- you know, a

14

somewhat confusing and murky alignment of opinions,

15

that -- and I think everyone agrees with

16

this -- interpreted only at Section 2a, the

17

discrimination based on class provision.

18

Then, two years later, Congress came in with

19

this amendment to specifically identify what it wanted

20

to do about mixed motive.

21

for when Congress has specifically called for this mixed

22

motive treatment, it's but-for, is the holding of Gross.

23

And Gross says that, except

And when we look to this provision -- I

24

mean, there are different ways of looking at it, but one

25

would be to say that I'm not aware of any statute that
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has a specific retaliation provision, where this Court

2

has construed discrimination based on class, generally,

3

to encompass retaliation because that would make the

4

retaliation provision here in 3a absolutely surplusage.

5

It would make the other statutory

6

cross-references to 3a surplusage because you'd be

7

taking the specific retaliation provision within Title

8

VII and subsuming it within a general treatment of

9

discrimination based on -- on class, race, and so forth.

10

And this basic structure of these provisions

11

of Title VII is that, when Congress wants to refer to

12

all Title VII discrimination claims, it will refer as it

13

did in subsection 2n to a claim of employment

14

discrimination, generally.

15

It will refer as it did, also, in Section 2,

16

to an unlawful employment practice, which would cover

17

the waterfront, but when it wants to cover a specific

18

subset, it refers to retaliation, as spelled out in

19

3(a), or to discrimination based on membership in one of

20

the five protected classes.

21

And here --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I somehow

22

lost what you were saying.

23

presumption in Jackson -- that, when we talk about

24

discrimination on the basis of race, that it includes

25

retaliation, generally?

Isn't the law -- and our

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, the reason -- well,

2

what Jackson says, of course, then is that Title VII is

3

vastly different.

4

And the --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, different because

5

it was the beginning of this sort of endeavor on

6

creating a statute.

7

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, the distinction that

8

Jackson draws and, also, that Gomez-Perez draws -- you

9

know, expressly, in distinguishing this type of

10

situation, is if you have a broad general prohibition on

11

discrimination or discrimination based on race, without

12

more -- without more specificity, the Court will presume

13

that that would include retaliation.

14

But, when you have a statute, like this one,

15

that specifically singles that -- specifically

16

describes, in detail, the different types of prohibited

17

discrimination, including, specifically, retaliation,

18

this Court has never overridden that specific statutory

19

text to put one of those specifically broken-out types

20

of discrimination into another more general one, such as

21

discrimination based on race, which is why --

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm -- I'm not sure what

difference it makes.
MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, because, otherwise, you

are taking the -9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, other than in

the outcome you want here.

3

MR. JOSEFFER:

As a matter -- well, I mean,

4

as a matter of statutory interpretation, right, which

5

then drives the outcome, the difference is that if -- if

6

you treat a specific retaliation reference or provision

7

as being subsumed within a more general one, a

8

discrimination based on race, for example, you are

9

treating the specific retaliation reference to be

10

surplusage, to have no effect and to not need to be

11

there.

12

And you're treating the other statutory

13

cross-references to it as also being surplusage, which

14

is why, when Congress does speaks more directly, this

15

Court's never overridden -- never said that it will take

16

a specific retaliation provision and treat it like it's

17

not there and toss it and -- based on race, for example.

18

And that's why -- I mean, that's why those

19

general cases they cite, those are our cases because

20

Jackson specifically says that Title VII is vastly

21

different for this very reason.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean,

23

Title VII is written before any of these cases come

24

along.

25

anti --

So Title VII is written, and it says we have an
a substantive antidiscrimination provision, and
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we have a retaliation provision.

2

And then the Court starts issuing cases.

3

And it says, by the way, you actually don't need both.

4

One will do the job for you because one includes the

5

other.

6

and that's in Gomez-Perez, and I'm sure I am missing a

7

few.

And that's in Sullivan, and that's in Jackson,

Three, four, five times, the Court says this.

8
9

And so then, in 1991, Congress comes back,
and it says, we want to make some amendments, what do we

10

have to do?

11

substantive provision and the retaliation provision?

12

Well, no, we have been told five times that, as long as

13

we say one, it means both.

14

does in 1991.

15

Do we have to amend both the anti -- the

MR. JOSEFFER:

And so that's what Congress

There are a couple -- if you

16

just look at '91, there are a few reasons that we know

17

from the '91 that doesn't work.

18

the same time in 1991, Congress enacted the Americans

19

With Disabilities Act, where it, again, separately broke

20

out discrimination based on disability and retaliation,

21

treated them separately.

22

that it was treating them differently.

23

One is, at almost at

So Congress hadn't forgotten

Also, in this very provision, the Civil

24

Rights Act of 1991, Congress specifically

25

cross-referenced both the part of Title VII that
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contains the general provision and the part of VII,

2

Section 3, that contains retaliation.

3

specifically dealing with these separate provisions,

4

acknowledging that it has in fact, presumptively, at

5

least, has read them and understands the distinction.

6

So it's

I mean, I think we presume that anyhow, but we

7

know it from the actual statutory text of the '91 -- of

8

the '91 Act.

9

And then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, it seems that the

10

overall purpose of the '91 Act was to overrule decisions

11

of this Court that Congress thought had not interpreted

12

Title VII properly.

13

And am I right that what they put about

14

motivating factor -- a motivating factor, that is more

15

plaintiff-friendly than the -- than the standard that

16

the Court declared in -- in Price Waterhouse?

17

MR. JOSEFFER:

For -- for those cases

18

that -- that the motivating factor provision governs,

19

it's more plaintiff-friendly, yes.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's -- it's really

21

odd to think that, in wanting to go beyond what we did

22

in Price Waterhouse, the Court meant to set up an

23

entirely different standard for -- for retaliation.

24
25

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, that was, basically,

the same argument that this Court rejected in Gross,
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in -- in that Gross involved another absolutely

2

identical statutory provision, that was lifted, in fact,

3

deliberately lifted verbatim, from Title VII to be put

4

into the Age Act.

5

it was that, look, whatever Congress's overall purpose

6

or general purpose behind the 1991 act, as a whole,

7

right, what we have to do is look at what it actually

8

did, what lines it actually drew in any given situation.

9
10

And what this Court held, basically,

And here -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, even looking --

11

let's look at what they actually did.

12

this (m) section, it says, "except as otherwise provided

13

in this subchapter."

14

retaliation as well, in the subchapter.

If we look at

I take it that would include

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.
"An unlawful employment

17

practice is established."

18

the retaliation provision, it says, "It shall be an

19

unlawful employment practice."

And then, when we go over to

20

So why doesn't that suggest that the -- "an

21

employment practice" under the retaliation provision is

22

the same as "an employment practice" under this --

23

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, the -- under Title VII,

24

there are basically three different ways to establish an

25

unlawful employment practice.

One is the general

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provision for discrimination because of membership in a

2

class.

3

another one.

One is because of retaliation.

4

And this is

So this defines, basically, a third way of

5

establishing whether an employment practice is unlawful.

6

And what it says is that any employment practice that is

7

motivated by one of the five listed factors is an

8

unlawful employment practice.

9

keeps coming back to do those five factors, those five

So this is why it all

10

motivations, do they or do they not include retaliation?

11

We agree with the Government that that's what it all

12

comes down to.

13

And, as to that question, I mean, there was

14

discussion, earlier today, about -- you know, the weight

15

of authority.

16

squarely addressed this.

17

because Title VII's text and structure are so clear,

18

that Title VII -- and that's what -- that was the basis

19

for the distinction of Title VII in Gomez-Perez --

20

Excuse me.

21

provisions of the Age Act, made the same point.

22
23

They've all agreed with us

Gomez-Perez distinguished the identical

Jackson, again, said Title VII was vastly
different for this reason --

24
25

I mean, nine courts of appeals have

JUSTICE SCALIA:
well.

I can't understand you very

Could you -- maybe you have to lift up your mike,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

or maybe you have to speak more slowly.

2

an awful time following you.

But I'm having

3

MR. JOSEFFER:

4

I was just saying the basic point is that,

I apologize, Your Honor.

5

as Jackson and Gomez-Perez indicated, the specific

6

controls the general.

7

retaliation, that's a different subset of discrimination

8

that's not then subsumed within discrimination based on

9

class.

10

And, when Congress breaks out

Otherwise, you are reading out the

11

retaliation provisions and making them surplusage, which

12

is why all of the many courts of appeals that have looked

13

at this unanimously agreed with us.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

The EEOC didn't.

Right.

Well, the -- this

16

Court has already disagreed with the EEOC.

17

two footnotes and informal guidance that say that, under

18

the 1991 amendments, retaliation claims can be proven

19

under a mixed motive theory for any of the statutes that

20

the EEOC administers, which is clearly contrary to

21

Gross.

22

The EEOC has

And that informal guidance does not

23

contain -- what it contains, basically, is -- you know,

24

policy analysis of why they would like that to be the

25

result, but no textual analysis whatsoever.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

There's --

Official

1

so the guidance in one doesn't get deference because

2

it's contrary to the plain text of the statute, as

3

numerous courts of appeals have recognized.

4

And, two, in terms of its power to persuade,

5

I mean, this Court has already rejected it, and, even as

6

applied to Title VII retaliation -- you know, courts of

7

appeals have unanimously rejected it as well because

8

there is just policy there.

9

analysis.

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

There's no actual textual

As of 1991 -- well,

Gomez-Perez and Jackson came after 1991, right?

12

MR. JOSEFFER:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, the others before.
So, as of 1991, was there

14

any case -- any decision of this Court other than

15

Sullivan, that could have possibly led Congress to a

16

conclusion that the general prohibition against

17

discrimination included a prohibition of retaliation?

18

MR. JOSEFFER:

I think you are right about

19

the timing.

20

know that the law was a whole lot different in 1991 than

21

it had been in '64 on this.

22

And Sullivan was so general that -- I don't

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But-Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in

23

CBOCS, we said that, because of Sullivan, alone -- just

24

because of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to

25

exclude explicit language about retaliation.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

In other

Official

1

words, we -- we said Sullivan made the point clear.

2

Now, Justice Alito was right.

After that,

3

it goes on.

4

But we have said that Sullivan, itself, made the point

5

clear that you did not need explicit language about

6

retaliation.

7

We have done it many more times after 1991.

MR. JOSEFFER:

Right, but the -- and the

8

main point is the one I was making earlier, that, in

9

1991 itself, Congress was continuing to distinguish

10

between retaliation and discrimination based on class

11

and in provisions of this Act and also in the almost

12

simultaneously enacted Americans With Disabilities Act.

13

But there has been another provision in the

14

Disabilities Act that treats retaliation and

15

discrimination based on -- on disability is

16

significantly different, in terms of the remedies that

17

are available for the two.

18

Congress has, elsewhere, also been distinguishing

19

between the two.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, even at the same time,

I mean, here's what

21

you're -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's

22

question -- but here's what you're asking us to accept,

23

Mr. Joseffer:

24

in which there has -- there have never been separate

25

standards for retaliation and substantive

Congress comes along, in 1991, in a world

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

discrimination.
Congress is trying to codify and make even

3

stronger the Price Waterhouse decision, right?

4

They -- you know, they say, basically, we like Price

5

Waterhouse, but it's kind of confused, and the court was

6

kind of fractured, we're going to really put it into

7

place legislatively.

8
9

They do that, they follow the -essentially, the drafting manuals that we have given

10

them in Sullivan.

11

they really meant was that retaliation would have a

12

different standard, and, indeed, that the retaliation

13

would have the standard that the dissenting justices

14

suggested in Price Waterhouse, notwithstanding that what

15

Congress was clearly intending to do was codify the -- the

16

plurality-plus position.

17

And you're saying, well, no.

MR. JOSEFFER:

What

Well, what -- Gross rejected

18

a fair amount of that reasoning, right?

19

point is that Price -- you could say that, until Price

20

Waterhouse, there is no reason to think that there

21

should be mixed motive claims, right?

I mean, the

22

Now, Congress, shortly thereafter, came in

23

with the '91 amendments to say, okay, we'll have mixed

24

motive claims in this one category.

25

relatively narrow category, we're going to assume

Congress does not want them anywhere else, even

2

though -- you know, discrimination under the Age Act or

3

under Title VII, you could ask why should it be

4

different?

Well, because Congress decided it would be.

5

Here --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Gross is talking about

7

outside of Title VII.

8

of Gross outside of Title VII, here, where Congress is

9

specifically trying to make Title VII conform with Price

And -- and whatever might be said

10

Waterhouse, with the backdrop of our legislative

11

drafting instructions and with the backdrop of never

12

distinguishing between retaliation and

13

anti-discrimination -- you know, how do you get to where

14

you want to be?

15

This would be, like -- talk about elephants

16

in mouse holes or talk about -- you know, we can take up

17

all our cliches, the dog that didn't bark -- you know,

18

Congress doesn't do things like this without saying

19

something.

20

MR. JOSEFFER:

Well, first off, it did

21

because, in this statute, as in others, it distinguishes

22

between discrimination based on membership in a class

and retaliation, but it wants to cover all of it, it

But, beyond that, again, in terms of the

2

backdrop, though -- I mean, the -- the whole point of

3

Gross is that you -- you stick to the plain language of

4

'91, and that's -- that's where mixed motive treatment

5

is permitted, and, also, elsewhere there's a -- there's a

6

negative inference elsewhere that is so strong that, as

7

you said, it applies even in other statutes.

Well, if that negative inference applies in
other statutes, it would sure apply within the same

10

statute that -- that this provision exists in and is

amending.

between discrimination based on class and retaliation

that Congress could -- didn't have to -- but could

14

certainly, reasonably, choose to follow.

Also, there are significant differences

One is that

The primary evil Congress was after here,

right, was discrimination based on race, sex, religion,

18

and so forth.

19

prophylactic provision to help enforce the primary

right, but Congress could reasonably conclude that the

21

significant cons with mixed motive treatment did not

22

justify extending it to the secondary right.

MR. JOSEFFER:

The only thing you'll find in

2

the legislative history -- the only thing you'll find

3

that's specific to this, is that Congress was aware of

4

retaliation, including aware of Title VII's retaliation

5

provision, and it amended legislation to incorporate

6

that provision when it wanted to.

it the same thing it calls the substantive

MR. JOSEFFER:

No, my -- my point is this:

18

This Court explained, for example, in Burlington

19

Northern, the two -- the two are both prohibited types

20

of discrimination, generally, under but-for standard,

21

but they are different, which is why we have different

22

labels and different names for the two categories.

23

And -- and Congress could reasonably choose

24

to give greater protection to the primary right and not

25

the secondary one, considering the negative.
21
Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Calls it both identical

things, an unlawful employment practice.

3

MR. JOSEFFER:

Yes.

And, textually -- but

4

it then describes seven different unlawful employment

5

practices, discrimination based on the five classes and

6

discrimination based on the two types of protected

7

conduct.

8

This provision then applies to the five

9

practices and leaves out the two types of protected

10

conduct, which is why, textually speaking -- and there's

11

no contrary legislative history -- Congress meant to

12

apply this to some, but not all types of unlawful

13

conduct -- of unlawful -- of employment practices.

14

And the reason that that's perfectly

15

rational is three things.

First, as I mentioned, this

16

is the secondary of them.

Second, it sweeps -- by its

17

nature, retaliation sweeps so much broader, well outside

18

of the traditional workplace, that while Congress was

19

thinking about jettisoning traditional burdens of proof

20

and relieving a plaintiff of the -- of the traditional

21

burden of proving its own case, they could certainly

22

balk at doing that in a much broader setting.

23

And, third, the potential for meritless and

24

abusive suits is particularly pronounced in a

25

retaliation context because any employee, at all, can
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

opt into a retaliation claim by making a charge of -- a

2

relevant charge, knowing that -- you know, potentially

3

knowing that, yeah, the writing's on the wall, that,

4

I probably am going to be fired.

5

And if you then flip the burden, so the

6

plaintiff doesn't have prove its own claim, the

7

plaintiff can point to the timing of his own complaint,

8

the inevitable employment action that would have happened

9

anyway, and the proximity of them is probably going to

10
11

get the plaintiff past summary judgment.
Now, when you're then looking at an

12

expensive and unpredictable trial, most defendants will

13

be forced to settle even meritless claims.

14

EEOC's own statistics show that, one, retaliation claims

15

have become all the rage.

16

And the

They are the -- the leading type of claims

17

being raised these days.

18

reasonable cause determination show that only 5 percent

19

of them have even reasonable cause to support them,

20

which is not an especially high standard.

21

And, two, the EEOC's

So, when we're talking about a potential

22

massive amount and growing amount of mostly meritless,

23

but expensive litigation to defend, it's perfectly

24

reasonable for Congress to decide, well, within the

25

scope of what Price Waterhouse was exactly dealing
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

with -- to get back -- to get back to Justice Kagan's

2

point -- we'll have -- we'll allow some mixed motive

3

treatment there, but that'll be it now,

4

because -- because there are other issues with

5

retaliation that caused -- caused Congress to reasonably

6

do exactly what it so clearly did in statutory text.

just says Jackson's wrong.

9

MR. JOSEFFER:

10

No, not at all.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It just doesn't make

11

any -- much sense to me that, in 1991, when they were

12

thinking about Price Waterhouse burdens, that, somehow,

13

they thought that it should now apply that burden

14

differently to retaliation.

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

It -- it was -- the same

argument was rejected in Gross, right?

even comes into play because it sounds to me like

6

get into a vicarious liability question.

I -- I don't think 2(m) gets into that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Obviously, you are better

off keeping your time.

MR. JOSEFFER:

I was going to say, under

12

if I have two thoughts in my head, a bad one, but then I

13

go ahead and treat the person the same way I would have

anyhow, then I have done what, under Title VII,

treat everyone equally, regardless of the bad thought in

my head.

And, at that point -- and that's why mixed

motive claims really threaten to take the statute from

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN P. LAUTEN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. LAUTEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:

It does not make any sense at all for

6

Congress to have created two causation standards under

7

the same statute in 1991 without saying anything about

8

it at all.

9

had not to amend e-3(a) in 1991.

There are three good reasons why Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Why did

1

MR. LAUTEN:

Well, they didn't have to amend

2

e-3(a) because there were policy -- the Burlington

3

Northern case, for example, where this Court held that

4

retaliation is considerably broader, that provision,

5

where -- where the Court held that retaliation in

6

Burlington actually went beyond conditions in the

7

workplace, that was the second reason.

8
9

And the third reason is imagine if they had
amended e-3(a) or if they had deleted or repealed it.

10

We would be here saying, well, why did they do that, if

11

they had already knew in Sullivan, since 1964, why would

12

they amend the Act?

13

E-2(m), on its text, applies to e-3(a).

14

Congress could have very well put an e-2(m) under this

15

section.

16

individual's race, color, religion, sex, national

17

origin, but what it did was it said a complaining party

18

must demonstrate -- and then it lists those things.

19

then it says, "for any employment practice."

20

It could have very well put an e-2(m), an

And

E-3(a) specifically defines retaliation as

21

an unlawful employment practice.

22

which, again, was a new provision altogether -- Congress

23

did not go in and amend e-2(a) through e-2(d), as it

24

easily could have done, but it created a new provision.

publicly, we are really happy that we are going to fire

3

him.

4
5

Now, how does that work out under the
motivating factor analysis?

6

MR. LAUTEN:

Very easily because, in that

7

situation, the employer wouldn't even have to prove the

8

affirmative defense because the employee wouldn't be

9

able to prove a violation of the Act because it was a

10

spurious claim.

11

number --

12

That's point number 1.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But point

Is that correct?

Can't

13

you -- can't you succeed on a retaliation claim if your

14

underlying substantive claim is invalid?

15

MR. LAUTEN:

You cannot prevail on a

16

retaliation claim under e-2(m) without proving, first, a

17

violation of the Act, and that is the distinction

18

Congress made in e-2(m) for Price Waterhouse, whereas

19

Price Waterhouse held there was no violation, as long as

20

the affirmative defense was proven.

21

What Congress did in 1991 was say, once you

22

prove a motivating factor and a violation of the Act,

23

only then do you get to the affirmative defense.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

for substantive discrimination and -- and retaliation.

2

MR. LAUTEN:

There is nothing in the

3

legislative history in 1991 that supports that.

4

fact, I would argue the contrary.

5

Section 101 in 1991, which is 42 U.S.C. 1981, in that

6

provision where it overruled Patterson v. McLean and the

7

Court held that retaliation was encompassed within the

8

substantive discrimination provision, which is what the

9

Court held in CBOCS v. Humphries, in the House bill that

In

When Congress passed

10

accompanied the Act, it said that Congress intended for

11

retaliation to apply to Section 101, but it's not in the

12

section at all that became 101 that was in CBOCS.

13

In Gomez-Perez v. Potter, as you well know,

14

this Court held the absence of retaliation provision

15

under the Federal sector provision did not undermine the

16

argument that retaliation was included, even though

17

Congress had a separate anti-retaliation provision in

18

the private sector.

19

And there was a very good argument from the

20

court of appeals, as you well know, that, hey, if

21

Congress wanted an anti-retaliation provision, why

22

wouldn't they have done so, they did it on the private

23

part?

some -- the argument is purely linguistic, all right?

(M) says race is a motivating

factor in an unfair employment situation.

12

situation is, at the beginning, unfair employment

13

practice.

all right?

because of retaliation.

Now, that's the answer -- I -- I

Now -- now, what I was

15

looking for, perhaps without success, is some other

example that has nothing to do with retribution, but

17

where that's clearly so, that's why the example came

18

into my mind that it is possible that you could, under

19

the basic unfair employment section, find a person

20

liable of race discrimination, even though that person

21

himself was not motivated by race, but perhaps had an

22

obligation to report a race discrimination, which he

23

failed to do because he wanted to go to the racetrack.

You see?

I'm looking for some other -- is there any

we've said, you, Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, you are guilty

of race discrimination, even though that's because of

4

your responsibilities because of what you did or didn't

5

do, it's not because you, yourself, held the motive, but

6

you -- you'd attribute the motive to them for reasons to

7

do with the statute.

8

What I'm concerned about is the text of this

statute -- "for any reason other than discrimination on

retaliation, from the other aspects of race, color,

MR. LAUTEN:

Justice Scalia, that's

So why, in 1991, would Congress go amend

1

The word "retaliation" is nowhere in Title VII at all.

2

That's point number 1.

3

if -- Congress could have specifically put in there an

4

individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national

5

origin, and, clearly, that would have been anchored to

6

e-2(a) to e-2(d).

7

Point number 2 is,

Instead, it created a different provision

8

altogether, e-2(m), and specifically said a complaining

9

party demonstrates, and it didn't say under this

10

section, and it defines any unlawful employment

11

practice.

12

Any.
And then, if you look at e-3(a), it

13

specifically defines what we refer to as retaliation,

14

albeit Title VII doesn't use that word, as an unlawful

15

employment practice.

16

Now, I want to make this really clear

17

because the Government is not making this -- this

18

argument.

19

you reject that argument and you find that e-2(m) does

20

not govern e-3(a), although we strongly urge the Court

21

to -- to embrace that argument, as the Solicitor General

22

has done as well, but, if you reject that argument, by

23

default, we're under Price Waterhouse -- juries have

24

been instructed since jury trials started in 1991, under

25

a Price Waterhouse framework in retaliation cases.

defense provisions Congress enacted, that is to say,

12

would also apply to retaliation cases?

13

MR. LAUTEN:

Absolutely.

If this Court

14

embraces our argument, 5(g)(2)(B) would apply to

15

retaliation.

Judge Ginsburg brought up a great point -- Justice

The only thing that's going to happen is, if

they prove the affirmative defense, it's a complete bar.

evidence before you get into Price Waterhouse, right?

7

You don't need that under subsection (m).

8

MR. LAUTEN:
answer for that.

I don't have -- I don't have an

The answer is I do not know.

My -- my belief is that e-2(m) and

11

5(g)(2)(B) -- the distinction e-2(m) makes is that it

12

makes it a violation of the Act to prove an illegal

13

motive, whereas, in Price Waterhouse, you haven't

14

violated the Act at all until the affirmative defense is

15

disproved, so that that is the distinction with e-2(m).

16

5(g)(2)(B) just goes to the remedy, whereas

17

the affirmative defense of Price Waterhouse was a

18

complete bar.

19

20

are not exchanging or creating two standards.

So my point is, is that, even if the

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

3

I want to start, Justice Alito, with your

4

question as to why it would make sense or why it might

5

make sense for Congress to adopt a different causation

6

standard with respect to substantive discrimination on

7

the one hand and retaliation on the other.

8
9

And what that question reveals is what,
Justice Kagan, you had mentioned.

There is not a single

10

statute that Petitioner can point to and not a single

11

statute that I am aware of, where Congress has ever

12

expressly adopted two different causation standards,

13

with respect to intentional discrimination under the

14

same statute.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But I thought -- I thought

16

the thrust of Justice Alito's question was that

17

retaliation claims are -- are now quite common, and they

18

can almost be used as a defensive -- as a defense when

19

you know you are about to be hired.

20

true, shouldn't we be very careful about the causation

21

standard?

22

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

24
25

And, if that's

And on that -And so -- so that -- that

was the thrust of -- of his question.
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

And -- and I want to

address that because I don't think that's quite right.

2

You can't just scream "discrimination" when

3

you're -- you know, when the writing is on the wall and

4

you know you're going to get fired.

5

As this Court recognized in Clark County,

6

the courts of appeals have uniformly, in opposition

7

cases, required there to be a reasonable good-faith

8

belief that the discrimination actually occurred.

9

if we are talking about truly frivolous claims, I know I

So,

11

The other point I would --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's -- that's a fair

3

point, but it's, like, if we change it a little bit so

4

that it's -- it's not frivolous, but it is clearly

5

groundless, once its examined, then you still have the

6

problem.

7

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

And then I don't think

8

it's as severe of a problem as Your Honor is suggesting,

9

for a couple of different reasons.

10

Number one, if you are positing a situation

11

where there is clear evidence that the employer would

12

have made the same decision, regardless, that is a

13

defense that is available to the employer, and there is

14

no reason they couldn't seek partial summary judgment

15

with respect to that.

16

that are available --

17
18
19
20

That severely limits the remedies

JUSTICE SCALIA:
understand.

Excuse me.

Say it again?
MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

In circumstances where

the employer would have made the same decision --

improper motive --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

-- that is a defense

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under (g)(2)(B), and it's something that the employer

2

could certainly raise on partial summary judgment that

3

would severely limit the remedies available.

4

The other point I would make is it does

5

still needs to be a motivating factor.

6

actually play a role in the employment decision, and so

7

that is the standard.

8

know, that Congress has adopted, clearly, with respect

9

to substantive discrimination claims.

It needs to

And it's a standard that -- you

10

And if I could turn, now, to the language of

11

the statute because that is our primary argument, if you

12

look at the language --

13
14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Just before you do

that --

15

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure.
-- because I

17

understood we are talking about what possible reason

18

there could be for drawing this distinction.

19

to me that the protection against discrimination --

20

race, color, religion, sex -- that sets forth the basic

21

principle of -- of fair and equal treatment.

22

It seems

The anti-retaliation provision is more

23

functional.

24

discrimination is you make sure people don't retaliate

25

when they complain about it.

The way you protect against that

Now, that seems, to me, to

be an order of -- of hierarchy removed from the basic

2

protections, in order to ensure that that primary

makes sense to have the same --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

The problem is -And you have a --

The problem is this:

It's

6

one thing to say -- and it's a good thing to say to

7

employers, when you are making employment decisions, you

8

take race out of your mind, take gender out of your

9

mind, take national origin out of your mind.

10
11

It's not

something you can even think about.
But, when you are talking about retaliation,

12

when you are talking about an employer who has been,

13

perhaps publicly, charged with discrimination and the

14

employer knows that the charge is not a good charge,

15

it's pretty -- it's very, very difficult to say to that

16

employer and very difficult for the employer to say, I'm

17

going to take this completely out of my mind, I'm not

18

even going to think about the fact that I am -- have

19

been wrongfully charged with discrimination.

20

Isn't that a real difference?

21

MS. ARBUS SHERRY:

I don't think it is, and

22

I think it's significant, if we are talking about

23

distinguishing between retaliation -- it's significant

24

that Congress, in a number of whistleblower statutes, so

25

specifically retaliation statutes, has adopted a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

contributing factor, a motivating factor standard, and,

2

in fact, has adopted a same-decision defense where you

need clear and convincing evidence.

4

So I think Congress's judgment is that that

5

distinction is not one that should be made, that it

6

is --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You -- you talk about

8

Congress as though it's a continuing body out there, the

Some of them may have

To -- to assume that there is one Congress

the best thing we can be guided by is, simply, the text

I am actually happy to turn to the

I think it's important to look at the language of

51
Alderson Reporting Company

And,

saying as, "Except as otherwise provided in Subchapter

2

(m), unlawful employment practice is established."

3

is a means of proving an unlawful employment practice.

And we know, when you look at 3(a), which is

5

on page 17a of our brief, that retaliation is an

6

unlawful employment practice.

7

"unlawful employment practice" in Subsection (m).

8

9

"under this section."

11

Congress used that phrase

And if you continue on, "when the

complaining party demonstrates that race, color,

14

factor."

15

Gomez-Perez, under CBOCS, under Jackson and Sullivan,

that race is a motivating factor in an employment

17

decision that is based on retaliation when you've

20

language, clearly encompasses the retaliation claims in

17

by the 1964 Congress.

18

that -- that enacted both subsection (m) and subsection

Congress is faced with a choice of deleting language

4

that had been there for 25 years, that wasn't a problem,

5

it's just, at worst, was redundant, chose to leave it in

6

place, lest any negative inference arise from the

7

deletion, and simply legislate, perspectively, in

8

subsection (m), in g-2(b), based on the new

9

understanding that the Court adopted in Sullivan.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL L. JOSEFFER

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. JOSEFFER:

16

This case seems to boil down to two very

Thank you.

17

simple legislative drafting rules or interpretive

18

principles.

19

that Congress doesn't relieve the plaintiff of the

20

traditional burden of proof, unless it specifically

21

indicates so.

22

where the relevant bases are the litany of race, color,

23

sex, religion, and national origin.

24
25

The first is, in -- from Gross, we know

And so then we talk to subsection (m),

So the second interpretive principle is,
then, does that litany here encompass -- you know,
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

complaining about unlawful conduct and participating in

2

an investigation, which are the protected conduct for

3

purposes of retaliation.

4

out of Jackson and Gomez-Perez, that, when Congress

5

broadly refers to discrimination on the basis of race in

6

the statute, without greater specificity, the Court will

7

read retaliation in.

8
9

That principle comes straight

When Congress breaks it out, the surplusage
canon -- and I agree with Justice Scalia, I really

10

didn't understand why they were talking about that --

11

and, also, the general canon is the same canon, which

12

is, put differently, is that specific provisions -- you

13

know, control over general ones; they're not subsumed

14

within them.

15

That tells us that, when Congress is

16

speaking more specifically, it's speaking more

17

specifically.

18

how to amend these statutes when it wishes to, which it

19

does all the time, and how the courts -- and how lower

20

courts should construe them.

21

Here, that tells Congress, very clearly,

In addition, Title VII, as a whole, is

22

especially clear because the same subsection 2 within

23

Title VII, when it wants to refer to all types of

24

employment discrimination, it will say, "a claim of

25

employment discrimination."

And, by the way, the 1991

56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress put that provision in there.

2

So this Congress knew how to say, "any claim

3

of employment discrimination," as it did so in

4

subsection (n), which comes right after this one.

5

Congress will also say, "an unlawful employment

6

practice," when it's referring to all of them, but, when

7

it wants to specifically refer to one subset or another,

8

it does so.

9

of the statute as a whole that every court of appeals to

10
11

That's a clear, logical, coherent reading

consider the question has adopted.
They're asking you to read various statutory

12

provisions to be surplusage, and there's simply no

13

reason to do so, especially because -- looking just at

14

1991, Congress, at that point, was not saying, oh, in

15

light of Jackson, we can now just speak more generally,

16

because it, specifically, in 1991, cross-referenced the

17

anti-retaliation provision of Title VII when it wanted

18

to, and it specifically used broader phrases like "a

19

claim of employment discrimination," when it wanted to.

20

And especially since the whole point of

21

Gross -- or much of the point of Gross was to replace a

22

totally unworkable and confusing regime with something

23

that is clear and straightforward, you've done that.

24

And the question, now, is whether to retreat back into a

25

jurisprudential morass where, within the very same
57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute, the drafting rules this Court has otherwise

2

articulated, no longer apply.

3

The final point I'd make is that, yeah,

4

there's this question about are -- are we treating --

5

you know, retaliation and -- and substantive

6

discrimination differently within one statute, and the

7

answer is, well, yes, as Congress did.

8

looking at it is they want to treat retaliation

9

differently in this statute than it's treated in every

10
11

The other way of

other statute.
You can -- you can point to similar

12

anomalies across the board, the reason being that

13

Congress has chosen to have two different sections

14

within this area.

And --
