We'll hear argument

Mr. Ortiz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. ORTIZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case concerns who counts and who does

12

not count as a supervisor under Title VII.

13

and the United States agree that the Seventh Circuit

14

rule violates the holding of Faragher, the reasoning of

15

Faragher and this Court's other central Title VII

16

precedents, including Burlington Northern and Staub, and

17

the common-sense meaning of the word "supervisor."

18

The parties

The parties even agree as to the general

19

legal standard, although they style it a little bit

20

different -- differently, that those harassers whose

21

employer-conferred authority over their victims enables

22

or materially augments the harassment should count as

23

supervisors.

24
25

This is not a standard, Your Honor, that
imposes automatic liability on employers.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Victims must

Official

1

still prove actionable harassment, and employers can

2

still take advantage of the Ellerth/Faragher affirmative

3

defense.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Let's say you have a

5

work room.

There are five people who work there.

And

6

the employer has a rule that the senior employee gets to

7

pick the music that's going to play all day long.

8

the senior employee says to one of the other

9

employees -- you know, if you don't date me -- I know

And

10

you don't like country music; if you don't date me, it's

11

going to be country music all day long.

12

Now, that affects the daily activities of

13

that other employee.

14

theory, that means that that senior employee is a

15

supervisor.

16

I would have thought, under your

MR. ORTIZ:

No, Your Honor, because in that

17

circumstance the adverse action would not amount to --

18

would not be severe.

19

pervasive --

20
21

Or, perhaps it would be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

be -- that could be far more severe than, for example --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

(Laughter.)

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well, that could

Hard rock instead of --

It could be far more

severe than simply saying, all right -- you know, you're
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to -- as in this case -- you're going to be

2

cutting the celery rather than -- you know, baking the

3

bread, or whatever.

4

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, no, Your Honor, this is

5

the -- the severity is an objective standard; it's not a

6

subjective.

7

dislike -- maybe it's debilitating, subjective --

8

dislike of rock music, some forms of country music --

9

might impair the performance of some in the workplace;

So in this case, someone's intense

10

but, from an objective reasonable employee's standpoint,

11

I don't believe that that would be the case.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Not all --

Well, but, I mean,

13

there are places where the environment -- you know, an

14

assembly line or something like that -- where the task

15

may not be that different, but how you -- the

16

environment in which you have to perform them may be far

17

more significant than whether or not you're attaching

18

the door handles or the front fenders.

19

MR. ORTIZ:

Oh, for sure, Your Honor, but

20

that has to be judged on a case-by-case basis.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

I would have thought the benefit of the Seventh

23

Circuit's test was that you don't have to go through

24

those case-by-case basis.

25

reasonable debate about whether the music you have to

Well, exactly.

And

I think we can have a

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

listen to for eight hours is objectively a significant

2

enough interference with the daily activities to qualify

3

under your test.

4

But the Seventh Circuit test makes clear --

5

it doesn't give any kind of immunity; it just makes

6

clear what type of analysis is going to be applied to

7

the allegation.

8
9

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Your Honor, the Respondent

actually exaggerates the determinativeness of the

10

Seventh Circuit rule, and the indeterminativeness --

11

both indeterminativeness and unpredictability of the

12

Second Circuit rule.

13

The Seventh Circuit itself has recognized --

14

the judges in the Seventh Circuit itself have recognized

15

that the rule does not really well fit the realities of

16

the workplace.

17

category to another.

It also just moves uncertainty from one

18

The category of supervisor may be a little

19

bit tidier; but, under the Seventh Circuit's approach,

20

the category of co-worker is very unpredictable.

21

The Seventh Circuit itself, in

22

Doe v. Oberweis Dairy, recognized that once you move

23

people who can take -- have this kind of power over

24

their victims but can't actually take tangible employment

25

actions against them into the category of co-workers,
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all of a sudden you have to apply a sliding scale of

2

negligence.

3

applies it.

Not only that, but the jury is the one who

4

So for those categories -- this exact

5

category of employee, Your Honor, the employee --

6

employer going forward has very little idea of

7

whether -- what standard of care is that a particular

8

jury would apply in that case and whether the jury would

9

decide it is met or not.
The Seventh Second -- Seventh Circuit rule,

10
11

in the overall, is no more determinative than the Second

12

Circuit rule.

13

Also, Respondent points to no cases in the

14

Second Circuit or the other circuits that have adopted

15

this rule where courts have identified problems with its

16

application.

17

And that -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, could you explain

18

what the materially augments rule means?

19

provide a definition of that?

20

daily tasks has to be sufficient to do what?

21

MR. ORTIZ:

Could you

The authority to assign

It has to be sufficient to

22

enable the harasser to instill either fear in the victim

23

that the victim should not turn the harasser in, or that

24

it may have to do with the harasser's ability to control

25

the physical location of the victim.
7
Alderson Reporting Company

That can augment

Official

1

harassment.

2

If an harasser can steer a victim to a

3

location where the harasser has an opportunity to

4

harass, and, indeed, may have an opportunity to harass

5

without other employees or other people in the company

6

seeing in, that would materially augment --

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are situations where

8

the -- the assignment of responsibilities is extremely

9

unpleasant, and so it's easy to see how the testimony

10

would apply in that situation.

11

But there are also a lot of situations, like

12

the Chief Justice's example, where it's really very

13

unclear.

14

courts can grapple with that.

I don't know how courts are going to -- how

15

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Your Honor, this --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

You said that being

17

subjected to country music or hard rock or Wagner -- you

18

know, every single day in the workplace would not be

19

sufficient.

20

it was -- that that is.

21

I don't know.

MR. ORTIZ:

Some people might think that

Justice Alito, this part of the

22

standard, particularly the materiality requirement, is

23

meant to track this Court's standard in Burlington

24

Northern, where it said that only actions that are

25

materially adverse to the employee would count.
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And this Court identified the materiality

2

requirement there as actually working to make the

3

standard more objective, not --

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Ortiz, why isn't the

5

question that you're presenting academic in this case?

6

Because didn't the district judge say that there had

7

been no showing that Davis' conduct was sufficiently

8

severe or pervasive?

9

It wouldn't matter if the supervisor -- if

10

the conduct was not sufficiently severe or pervasive

11

harassment, and, equally, if the company responded every

12

time a complaint was lodged.

13

both of those things, that it wasn't severe and

14

pervasive, and that every time she claimed -- complained

15

an investigation was made.

16

MR. ORTIZ:

The district court found

Justice Ginsburg, we actually

17

tried to bring those things up before the Seventh

18

Circuit, but the Seventh Circuit found it unnecessary to

19

reach them because of its holding as to supervisory

20

liability.

21

If this Court were to reverse the Seventh

22

Circuit's affirmance of summary judgment of the district

23

court, the case would then be remanded to the Seventh

24

Circuit, where it could either look at these

25

alternative -- these other holdings, or the thing would
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

be -- it could be remanded at that point and sent back

2

to the district court for another look.

3

The district court's reasoning, the Seventh

4

Circuit noted, when it was talking about other incidents

5

of harassment was very unusual.

6

did was it divided all of the incidents into two

7

categories.

8
9

What the district court

One category -- one category consisted of
events that by themselves were not overtly racial in

10

nature and the other category consisted of those events

11

that were overtly racial in nature, where a racial

12

epithet had been hurled at someone, for example, and

13

said with respect to the first category, the things --

14

the events that on their face did not announce racial

15

animosity, that there wasn't any racial nexus, so they

16

didn't count, and swept all those events out and then

17

looked at the remaining ones where the connection to

18

racial animus was overt.

19

there may be some, but they just don't count.

And it said, well, these,

So the Seventh Circuit itself discredited

20
21

the reasoning of the district court in those very

22

holdings.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Ortiz, suppose I agree

24

with your standard, but I just can't find on the record

25

as it has been presented in this Court any evidence that
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Davis actually served as Vance's supervisor.

2

mean, what's your best -- so if that's true, I would be

3

tempted to actually just decide the thing rather than to

4

remand it.

5

What -- I

So as against that approach, what is your

6

best evidence that there was a supervisory relationship

7

under your standard here?

8
9

MR. ORTIZ:

First, Justice Kagan, it is

important to keep in mind that the record was developed

10

under the wrong legal standard.

11

that --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But even considering

Well, is that the case?

13

there evidence that you did not present because the

14

Seventh Circuit applied a different standard?
MR. ORTIZ:

15

There was evidence that was

16

probably not developed below because the Seventh

17

Circuit's standard was so absolute.

18

actually evidence in the record, we believe plenty of

19

evidence, sufficient certainly to overcome summary

20

judgment, although perhaps not enough for partial

21

summary judgment on this question in our favor.

22

Is

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is

What other than the job

23

description?

The job description says that the catering

24

specialist has authority to direct or lead the part-time

25

employees.

But what concrete instances of Davis
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

exercising supervisory authority over Vance is there in

2

this record?

3

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Justice -- there is two

4

separate questions, Justice Ginsburg.

5

of it; others is whether she has the authority or not.

6

Because this Court has held in Faragher itself that it

7

is the authority that makes the difference, not the

8

actual exercising of it in a particular case.

9

One is instances

But let me go through what is in the record

10

now, much of it which is in the Joint Appendix but not

11

all, because we were not aware that we would be opposing

12

a summary judgment motion before this Court.

13

First, William Kimes, who is the director of

14

the university banquet and catering division, the sort of

15

head of this 60-some-person department.

16

testified that he told them that Davis was a supervisor.

17

One of them was Vance; that could be found on page 198

18

of the Joint Appendix.

19

in Vance's position named Dawn Knox, and that statement

20

can be found on page 386 of the Joint Appendix.

Two employees

Another is an employee who was

William Kimes himself testified in his

22

deposition that Davis, quote:

"Directed and led other

23

employees in the kitchen."

That can be found on page

In an internal investigation

by compliance officers at Ball State -12
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What I mean is not the

2

statement, well, she's a supervisor.

But comparable to

3

Faragher, where the lifeguard who didn't have authority

4

to hire her or fire her said, if you don't date me, you

5

are going to be cleaning the toilets.

6

anything like that in this record.

7

MR. ORTIZ:

We don't have

Well, there was no overt threat

8

like that in the record, but the person who was hurling

9

racial epithets at her was in a position of authority

10

over her, both according to the job description, also

11

according to her understanding, according --

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But that was also -- that

13

would be for a very confined period.

14

when the -- when Vance was a part-time employee.

15

she is a full-time employee there isn't that.

16

MR. ORTIZ:

It would only be

No, Your Honor.

Once

There is two

17

separate provisions in the job description which cover

18

the whole period of time here.

23

The harassment started

On January 1st, 2007, Ms. Vance received a

24

that you pointed to, Justice, which specifically lists

25

among the duties and responsibilities of the catering

Alderson Reporting Company

specialist leading and directing part-time employees.

2

However, page 12 of the Joint Appendix lists under

3

positions supervised by the catering specialist, exactly

4

Vance's position.

5

sorry, from part-time to full-time on -- in January

6

2007, the supervisory nexus in the job description

7

merely jumped from page 13 to page 12.

8

covered for that whole period of time.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So when she moved from full-time --

But it was

What was the most unpleasant

10

thing that Davis could have assigned the Petitioner to

11

do?

Maybe chopping onions all day, every day?

12

MR. ORTIZ:

Certainly within the -- within

13

the job duties that she traditionally did, the kind of

14

things she had to work with, what she had to do, things

15

like this, working with onions, chopping onions all day

might be punishment.

of this would be relevant.

Would that be enough?

MR. ORTIZ:

Possibly, Your Honor.

It

depends, again, on questions which would depend upon how

3

you had to chop, how heavy the knives were, whether you

4

would get repetitive injuries.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Ortiz, did she ever

6

have that authority, because the record as far as we

7

have it says that the work assignments, what Vance was

8

doing, came from the chef or from Kimes, and the most

9

that Davis did was transmit the chef's orders of where

10

-- following up on an

21

issue raised in part by the Chief and by Justice

22

Ginsburg.

23

would there be an affirmative defense available to the

24

employer?

25

Assuming that Davis was a direct supervisor,

MR. ORTIZ:

For sure, Your -- for sure, Your

Honor.

2
3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That would be your

position?

4

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That this could not be

6

grounds that someone who directs an employee's

7

day-to-day activity should be treated like someone who

8

hasn't actually undertaken the threat because the

9

situations are different.
MR. ORTIZ:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

This is --

11

this falls out of the structure of the affirmative

12

defense as laid out in Ellerth and Faragher.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is that what this fight

14

is about?

15

governed or the Second Circuit test governed, but

16

because of the nature of the difference between formal

17

supervisors who take tangible work activities and

18

informal supervisors who the employer would have less

19

control over and less knowledge about their activities,

20

that we would require an employee to complain.

21

that be a crazy rule, and why?

22
23
24
25

What if we were to say that the EEOC's test

MR. ORTIZ:

Would

That this Court would require

under those circumstances?
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would require, would

permit the affirmative defense to be raised by an
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

employer.

2

MR. ORTIZ:

It doesn't actually map on well

3

to the structure of the affirmative defenses laid out in

4

Ellerth and Faragher.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but there is a

6

difference between those supervisors who take direct

7

activity, tangible direct actions, who are in power to

8

do that, and supervisors who don't have that power,

9

because supervisors who don't have that power are

10

supervised -- their actions are supervised in a way that

11

non-tangible employment supervisors are not.

12

MR. ORTIZ:

But under the existing

13

affirmative -- affirmative defense, as I understand it,

14

Your Honor, an employee who doesn't complain, unless

15

they are reasonable in not complaining, in most cases

16

would make the affirmative defense unavailable to the

17

employer.

18

between unreasonably failing to complain --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

Is it the question concerning the difference

No, it's whether,

whether or not this whole fight is over that issue.

21

MR. ORTIZ:

22

is in -- in part about that issue.

23

not the only --

24
25

That -- this whole -- the fight

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That is certainly

No, because it's also

about the burden of proof.
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if we keep the burden

3

of proof with respect to -- to the employer raising the

4

affirmative defense, does that solve half your problem?

5
6

MR. ORTIZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

It makes it

better.

7

And this Court has recognized the

8

affirmative defense appropriately allocates the burdens

9

between the employee and the employer going forward.
Your Honor, the Seventh Circuit rule,

10
11

although unsupported by Respondent, is supported by

12

several of the Respondents' amici.

13

to oversell the determinativeness of the Seventh Circuit

rule.

other?

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, Your Honor, it's a

Have you answered the

17

argument it shouldn't get any deference because what --

18

what the EEOC guidance does is it is -- it is

19

interpreting two decisions of this Court, and this

20

Court, not the EEOC, is in the best position to

21

determine what those two cases mean?

MR. SRINIVASAN:

15
16

Thank you, counsel.

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

17

When a person controls a subordinate's daily

18

work activities and subjects her to harassment, that

19

person qualifies as a supervisor for purposes of the

20

Faragher-Ellerth vicarious liability affirmative defense

21

framework.

22

When it controls daily work activities and,

23

therefore, for example, can compel the cleaning of

24

toilets for a year, the principle that the agency

25

relationship augments the ability to carry out the
20

harassment is implicated in that the victim will lack

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

1

don't disagree with that, and I don't disagree that

2

there are going to be cases that raise issues at the

3

margins.

4

But one way to think about the spectrum of

5

options available to the Court today is to envision that

6

on one end, you have harassment that's perpetrated by a

7

coworker, and you consider the types of harassment that

8

that might entail.

9

harassment that's perpetrated by a supervisor with

10

And on the other end, you have

authority over tangible employment actions.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and your

12

tests sort of use that, just as you've posed it, as some

13

broad continuum in which we're going to have countless

14

cases trying to figure out whether music falls closer to

15

this end or -- you know, what -- the senior employee

16

controls the thermostat, is that closer to this end or

17

that end?

Or cutting onions?

18

It seems to me that every single case has

19

its own peculiar facts, and courts are going to be --

20

have to figure out where on the continuum it resides.

21

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well -- well, I guess, Your

22

Honor, as Your Honor put it to -- to Petitioner's

23

counsel, the competing approach would be the approach

24

adopted by the Seventh Circuit; but, that approach has

25

some serious flaws.
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

For example, it wouldn't cover the

2

supervisor's conduct that was at issue in Faragher

3

itself, where the supervisor threatened that he would

4

make the harassment victim clean the toilets for a year

5

if she didn't succumb to the harassment.

6

that's a pretty significant cost.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I think

Well, isn't cleaning the

8

toilets a limited -- isn't the authority to decide who

9

cleans the toilets the same as the authority to decide

10

what the music is going to be?

11

It's one thing.

I thought -- and your answer on the music

12

was, well, that probably wouldn't count because it's the

13

authority to decide just one thing.

14

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Well, we don't -- I guess,

15

we don't know enough about the threat to force her to

16

clean the toilets for a year to know whether it's only

17

one thing.

18

there -- in the scope of a particular day, you have

19

three particular options as to what you might do,

20

monitor the beach, clean the facilities, including the

21

toilets, or prepare meals, then it's something that

22

covers the entire day.

23

But it could be, for example, that if

JUSTICE ALITO:

24

only authority was to decide who cleans the toilets,

25

then -- then that would not -- that wouldn't count,

2

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No, I think that -- I don't

3

think we have an answer to that until we know how much

4

of the day's work is encompassed by cleaning the

5

toilets.

He controlled what she would do on the

He -- he controlled every

11

aspect of her -- of her day's work, and cleaning the

12

toilets was one aspect of it.

14

a way to perpetuate the harassment.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that was a

what the case means.

MR. SRINIVASAN:

They've seen the cases in

Justice Breyer.

12

And I think it's important to bear in mind

13

that the nature of this inquiry is such that there's

14

going to be cases at the margins that raise difficult

15

questions; but, in Ellerth, the Court recognized that.

16
17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I ask you how the

Seventh Circuit test works in operation?

18

We're in a university setting here, so let

19

me give you a university hypo.

There's a professor, and

20

the professor has a secretary.

And the professor

21

subjects that secretary to living hell, complete hostile

22

work environment on the basis of sex, all right?

23

the professor has absolutely no authority to fire the

24

secretary.

25

that situation?

But

What would the Seventh Circuit say about

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SRINIVASAN:

2

authority over -- to -- to direct annual

3

employment actions, then --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That if there's no

No, no, the secretary is

5

fired by the head of secretarial services.

6

don't have the ability to fire secretaries; but,

7

professors do have the ability to make secretarial lives

8

living hells.

9

about that?

So what does the Seventh Circuit say

MR. SRINIVASAN:

10

Professors

The professor would not

11

qualify as a supervisor for purposes of Ellerth-Faragher

12

framework.

13
14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Under the Seventh Circuit

test.
MR. SRINIVASAN:

And so you'd look at it as

16

a -- you'd look at the professor as a coworker, and

17

you'd apply the same standards that applied to

18

harassment conducted by the coworker.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Even though, of course, it's

20

actually more difficult for the secretary to complain

21

about the professor than it would be for the secretary

22

to complain about the head of secretarial services.

23

MR. SRINIVASAN:

Yes.

And I think that's a

24

useful frame of reference that I was trying to

25

articulate earlier, which is that we can envision the
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

cases as falling on a spectrum between ability to

2

complain when the harassment is perpetrated by a

3

coworker on the one hand, and ability to complain when

4

harassment is perpetrated by a supervisor with tangible

5

employment authority --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And Mr. Srinivasan, if I can

7

just continue on about this, because I just don't even

8

understand the Seventh Circuit test.

9

Circuit test also say that -- that that person is not a

Would the Seventh

10

supervisor even if the professor evaluates the secretary

11

on a yearly basis?

12

MR. SRINIVASAN:

The Seventh Circuit would

13

say that as far as we can tell.

14

have a proviso for circumstances in which the harasser

15

has a role in determining tangible employment actions,

16

because that is one thing that the EEOC guidance takes

17

account of.

18

They don't appear to

It's that -- not just that somebody counts

19

as a supervisor when they themselves undertake tangible

20

employment action, but if they have a substantial role

21

in making recommendations that in turn trigger tangible

22

employment actions, the EEOC would take the position

23

that that qualifies.

25

Now, that's not an issue in this

11

question, Justice Sotomayor, is whether the parties had

12

a sufficient opportunity to develop the record.

13

if you take the record in the case as a given, we think

14

that the record would support the grant of summary

15

judgment for Ball State University, because there isn't

16

a sufficient showing in the record if you take it as a

17

given that the relevant supervisory -- the relevant

18

putative supervisory employee, Davis, had control over

19

day-to-day work activities.

20
21
22

Because

The question that remains is whether the
record should be allowed to be expanded.
JUSTICE ALITO:

The conclusion in your brief

23

is that the judgment of the court of appeals should be

MR. SRINIVASAN:

No.

I think if you take

the record as a given, that a grant of summary judgment

4

in favor of the employer would be in order.

5

normal course what this Court does when it announces a

6

new standard is it remands for the lower courts to deal

7

with the application of the standard to the facts.

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The judgment of the court of appeals should

18

employees whose status is at issue lacked the

19

supervisory authority necessary to trigger vicarious

20

liability under Title VII.

JUSTICE ALITO:

We took this case to decide

22

whether the Faragher and Ellerth -- and Ellerth

23

supervisory liability rule is limited to those harassers

24

who have the power to hire, fire, demote, promote,

25

transfer, or discipline their victim.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

And your answer

Official

to that is no; is that right?

MR. GARRE:

That's right.

We don't think

3

the Seventh Circuit test is the complete answer to the

think it's clear that the -- the person whose status is

6

at issue did not qualify and therefore, the judgment

7

should be affirmed.

8
9

But we

This Court --

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Well, if we --

if we agree with that without having any party defending

10

the rule that was adopted by three circuits, then

11

surely -- well, then, why shouldn't we just remand this

12

case for the lower courts to decide this, this summary

13

judgment issue, and -- and permit further development of

14

the record if the record isn't fully developed?
MR. GARRE:

15

Well, most importantly, Justice

16

Alito, because the courts need guidance on how to apply

17

the EEOC and the Second Circuit standard.

18

to provide that guidance is to do what this Court often

19

does, which is to apply the facts to the standard.

The best way

In this case, applying the record facts to

20

the standard that we think applies, the "materially

22

enables the harassment" standard, it's clear that Ms.

supervisor.

He is the one that told employees what times of days

13

whether Davis could have controlled what Petitioner did

that Justice Kagan brought up in her colloquy with --

with Mr. Srinivasan, I think the logic of the Court's

precedents, agency principles adopted, would lead to the

conclusion that someone who does control virtually all

aspects of one's schedule but yet lacks the authority to

MR. GARRE:

What this Court said in Faragher

2

and Ellerth -- and I appreciate that you dissented in

3

the case, but what this Court said was it adopted

4

Section 219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of Agency,

5

the notion that if -- if there was -- if the employee

6

was aided in the accomplishment of the harassment by

7

virtue of an agency relation, that that would be the

8

agency trigger for liability.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:
there?

If that's what the agency is --

11

MR. GARRE:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And RMA then --

13

at all.

14

thermostat would qualify.

15

Then why not leave it

-- then you don't need it

So the music -- the music would -- the

MR. GARRE:

It would all qualify.

I don't think it would, Your

16

Honor, because we agree, certainly, with the EEOC that

17

there are material limits to how far that principle

18

could be stretched.

19

The Court in Ellerth made clear that there

20

were limits to the vicarious liability of employers in

21

this context.

22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

Why?

I mean, if

that's your principle, apply the principle.

2

you know, comply with my sexual advances, apply the

3

principle.

4

line.

5

What's so hard about that?

MR. GARRE:

That's a clear

This is the balance I think that

6

the Court struck in Ellerth, Your Honor, which was -- it

7

took into account that the statute was passed against

8

the backdrop of agency principles; but, yet, Congress

9

also was cognizant that imposing vicarious liability on

10

the employer for acts that the Court recognized were not

11

themselves authorized by the employer, that that was a

12

punitive aspect of that, and the Court would establish

13

limits.

14

And I think our position takes into account

15

that there have to be limits in this area, on the extent

16

of vicarious liability, in order to give effect to

17

Congress's intent; but, also recognizes, in the

18

situation like you had with the lifeguard in Faragher,

19

that that person did have authority that would assist in

20

the harassment – date me or clean the toilets, as

21

the lifeguard in Faragher said.

22

And so the Court, I think, struck a

23

reasonable balance.

And taking the balance and what

24

this Court said, we think the proper way to resolve this

25

case is to adopt something like the EEOC rule or the
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Second Circuit rule, but to make clear there are limits.

2

And the best way to make clear that there are limits is

3

to make clear that on the record in this case Ms. Davis

4

did not qualify as a supervisor.

5

Now, my friend said they didn't have the

6

opportunity to develop evidence to the contrary; but,

7

the fact is, from the outset, they litigated this case

8

as if the Seventh Circuit standard did not apply.

9

The reasons that they gave for why Ms. Davis

10

was a supervisor, in the lower court, was that, one,

11

they pointed to the job description, that she had this

12

other authority to "lead and direct," and they also

13

pointed to the fact that she didn't clock in.

14

Those are irrelevant under the Seventh

15

Circuit test.

16

they wanted to try to show that Davis was different, and

17

it did have some marginal authority to lead --

18

So all along, they had in their mind that

JUSTICE ALITO:

What guidance would your --

19

what guidance would the kind of opinion that you're

20

suggesting we write really provide?

21

would be that if someone has no authority to assign

22

daily work, then that person isn't -- and also has no

23

authority to hire, fire, promote, et cetera, then that

24

person isn't a supervisor.

25

The -- the guidance

How much guidance is that?
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. GARRE:

I think it's a lot of guidance,

2

Justice Alito.

I think that the flip side of that is

3

the Court would make clear that merely having some

4

occasional or marginal authority to lead or direct by

5

virtue of one's better paper title or seniority is not

6

sufficient to trigger vicarious liability.

7

that's going to resolve the mine-run of the cases in

8

which this question has come up and been litigated, at

9

least to the courts of appeals.

I think

If you look, for example, at the difference

10
11

between something like the Mack case out of the Second

12

Circuit and the Mikels case out of the Fourth Circuit,

13

in Mikels, we had an example of two police officers, one

14

had a higher paper rank, corporal versus private, and it

15

was alleged that the corporal was a supervisor.

16

court said, no, no, no, he's not a supervisor, all there

17

is, is some marginal occasional authority.

18

sufficient.

And the

That's not

19

It was clear that the victim in that case

20

wasn't shy about telling the harasser where to go, to

21

tell him off.

22

And that's the kind of --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why should that --

23

why should that matter?

I know you said that in your

24

brief, Mr. Garre, if the -- if the alleged victim talked

25

back.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

But in one of the very first cases that we

2

had in this line, Harris v. Forklift, there was -- it

3

was the boss, so there was no question about supervisor,

4

and he was really making things hard for this employee;

5

but, she was very firm, and she talked back to him.

6

But, still, that's not what we said that

7

counted.

We said, is she being subjected to terms and

8

conditions of employment that she would not be subjected

9

to but for her sex.
MR. GARRE:

10

Right.

And we -- we don't think

11

that that's a dispositive criterion.

We recognize the

12

point that the person gets to establish superior ability

13

to stand up to despicable treatment.

14

our point is, is that it's part of the equation that you

15

would look at.

But I think what

16

In essence, did the person treat the alleged

17

harasser like a co-employee, or did the person treat the

18

alleged harasser like a supervisor?

19

the record is clear that she treated her like a

20

co-employee, someone who -- they obviously had

21

disagreements among them.

22

And in this case,

And I think that's what we take this piece

23

of evidence to assist the Court on the question

24

presented.

25

to resolve the question presented is the clear and

I think -- but we think what was sufficient

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unrefuted evidence that the prep sheets, the daily

2

activities were assigned by the chef or Mr. Kimes, that

3

Mr. Kimes had the authority to control the schedule.

4

And if you want to go further than that, the

5

record also shows that Mr. Kimes had the authority to

6

review -- to do annual reviews.

7

authority to evaluate.

8

that one would expect in a supervisor.

9

Mr. Kimes had the

He had all the kind of authority

And so you would ask the question, what's

left?

11

agree with the EEOC, is not, as a matter of law,

12

sufficient to trigger vicarious liability.

13

Essentially nothing.

And whatever is left, we

That doesn't mean she can't present her

14

claim.

15

under the framework for co-workers, in which she bears

16

the burden of establishing that the employer was

17

negligent in not responding to it.

18

It -- it means that it's just simply analyzed

And as Judge Wood, for the court of appeals,

19

and Judge Barker made clear in their detailed opinions,

20

this was not a situation where the employer stuck its

21

head in the sand and ignored incidents of unpleasantries

22

or, in some cases, despicable racial epithets --

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you were willing to

24

concede that this would be a close case under the Second

25

Circuit standard or under the EEOC guidance, then there
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

might be an argument in favor of our applying those

2

tests -- or one of those tests to the facts of the case,

3

because then that might provide some guidance, even

4

though we are supposed to be a court of review, not a

5

court of first view.

6

But you're saying this is an extremely weak

7

case under those standards; and, therefore, what is --

8

what benefit is there in our applying this?

9

it back and have it done in the normal course by the

10
11

Just send

court of appeals or by the district court.
MR. GARRE:

Well, Your Honor, we don't think

12

it's a close case, but my friend does, and his amici do.

13

And I think the damaging signal that this Court would

14

send by remanding on this record would be that, whatever

15

it might say in its opinion, that would have virtually

16

no force in terms of establishing a standard that made

17

clear that this -- whatever else may be true about what

18

would qualify, something like this does not qualify.

19

And, again, like this Court did in the

20

Global Tech case, when the Court establishes a standard,

21

oftentimes, it applies the standard to the facts and

22

appreciates that that's the best way, the most judicial

23

way of providing guidance on what that standard means.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Garre, there is one

BSU internal document that -- a note to the file by a
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

compliance officer, who apparently investigated one of

2

the complaints, that says that -- Kimes is recorded as

3

saying -- he's the avowed supervisor -- that he, quote,

4

"knows Davis has given direction to Vance, and that he

5

just doesn't know what else to do."

6
7
8
9

Doesn't that defeat summary judgment on its
face?
MR. GARRE:

It doesn't, Your Honor, if you

agree with our principle, that the EEOC also agrees

10

with, that having some limited or marginal authority to

11

lead or direct, as a matter of law, is not sufficient.

12

So that that piece of evidence, giving it its

13

reasonable inference, would not be sufficient to create

14

a material issue.

15

creating -- looking at the body of the evidence, which

16

makes crystal clear that the prep sheets are really what

17

was driving the daily activities in this workplace.

18

it was Kimes or the chef that did the prep sheets, not

19

Ms. Davis at all.

20
21
22

It also wouldn't be sufficient

And

And it -- and it was also not material in
light of the evidence that Mr. Kimes did the schedule.
Ms. Davis was asked at her deposition on

23

page 135, quote, "Was there ever" -- "have you ever been

24

assigned to a less meaningful or fulfilling job

25

classification?"

And her response was yes, and she
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

pointed to an example by Mr. Kimes, because it was

2

Mr. Kimes who had the authority to make those

3

assignments, not Ms. Davis.

4

So the mere fact that you've got some

5

marginal evidence drawn from snippets, giving it a

6

reasonable inference that she at times had some ability

7

to lead or direct, as the job description says, "by

8

coaching, demonstration or overseeing," is not

9

sufficient as a matter of law to entitle her to summary

10

judgment, nor do we think that this Court should take

11

the unusual step of remanding so that she can dig into

12

events six years old through new discovery.

13

Again --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Garre, could I ask you

15

about that?

16

to suggest that she left anything on the table because

17

of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard.

18

You said before that there is no -- nothing

So what's the best place in the record for

19

us to look -- to decide that question as to whether she

20

at all didn't present or didn't develop evidence because

21

of the nature of the Seventh Circuit standard?

22

MR. GARRE:

Well, first, I would look at her

23

summary judgment briefs, Your Honor, and in those briefs

24

she argued that Davis was a supervisor because, one,

25

under the job description she had the authority to lead
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and direct, the same sorts of things that we are talking

2

now and would be talking about under the EEOC and Second

3

Circuit tests.

4

they didn't clock in, again something that is irrelevant

5

under the Seventh Circuit test.

6

And, two, she points to the fact that

So this wasn't a case where the litigant

7

felt themselves bound by the legal standard and one

8

could surmise that they would have pursued it

9

differently.

I think I would look at that first.

And

10

then I would look at her deposition transcript which is

11

in the Joint Appendix and the three affidavits that she

12

put in, in this case, which are in the Joint Appendix.

13

At some point you would expect her to come

14

along and try to rebut the notion that Mr. Kimes and

15

Ms. Fultz assigned the daily activities through the prep

16

sheets.

17

in her own affidavit she seems to accept that the prep

18

sheets were done by Kimes and the chef.

19

430.

20

that Mr. Kimes was the one who did the scheduling, who

21

did her annual reviews, who disciplined her on occasion.

22

After all, she was claiming that Davis was the

23

supervisor, and she didn't feel bound by the Seventh

24

Circuit tests.

25

In fact, it's just the contrary.

If anything,

That's at JA

You -- you would expect her to contest the notion

So you would expect to see some indication
48
Alderson Reporting Company

of how Ms. Davis actually assigned her something to do,

changed her schedule, the like.

3

is all those sorts of allegations, she made them, but

4

all those sorts of allegations were directed to Mr.

5

Kimes.

6

which isn't before the Court.

7

sorts of things that you might expect one to complain

8

about against a supervisor in this sort of vein:

9

made me cut vegetables instead of doing the baking like

10

I like to do; she didn't assign me enough overtime so I

11

could make more money; she changed my hours.

12

Instead what you find

That was the basis for her retaliation claim,
But there are all the

17

There was Kimes and the chef who had

It's not enough for her to come here today,

18

I don't think, and just speculate that having an

19

opportunity to go through greater discovery, which in

20

essence would amount to a fishing expedition, the Court

21

should take the unusual step of remanding to give her an

22

opportunity for discovery.

23

acknowledge oftentimes this Court does remand for the

24

lower courts to undertake that inquiry, it certainly

25

doesn't always do so.

This Court -- although we

So Global-Tech is one example;
49

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

we've cited many more in our briefs.

2

And here, I think, again, the parties --

3

there is broad agreement on what the standard should be.

4

Something like the EEOC or Second Circuit test is, we

5

think, the best way to frame it.

6

among the parties about what that test means and how it

7

applies to Davis here, I think it's absolutely critical

8

for the Court to apply the legal test to the record

9

facts and hold that Ms. Davis is not a supervisor and to

10

But given the debate

affirm the judgment below.

11

Although it's not before this Court, if one

12

wants to go to the next step and think about the

13

affirmative defenses and the like, this isn't a case

14

where the Court would be putting to rest a valid Title

15

VII claim.

16

But the claim was extensively looked at

17

below by Judge Barker in the district court, Judge Wood

18

and her colleagues on the court of appeal, and they

19

found an environment in which Ball State reacted

20

responsibly to the allegations that were made,

21

investigated them and took prompt action where the

22

investigation warranted it, particularly with respect to

23

the most despicable things that were uncovered, racial

24

epithets that were used by another employee,

25

Ms. McVicker, not Ms. Davis.
50

1

The only allegations against Ms. Davis that

2

we think are relevant here during the time period that

3

Ms. Davis was a part-time employee were:

4

so-called elevator incident where Ms. Davis allegedly

5

blocked Ms. Vance as she got out of the elevator, which

6

isn't race-based at all, we don't think; and two, the

7

alleged use of words like "Sambo" or

8

"Buckwheat" to refer --

Mr. Ortiz said it wasn't

just part-time.

11

before that says she also -- that Davis also directed --

"Requires leadership of up to 20 part-time substitute

So we think it's clear.

We said -- this is in our red brief and

18

there wasn't any response to it in the yellow brief --

19

that any authority, any conceivable supervisory

20

authority, could have only existed when Ms. Vance was a

21

part-time employee.

22

But we don't think that that's relevant,

23

Your Honor, because putting -- putting aside whether she

24

had authority over catering assistants who were part

25

time or full time, the record is absolutely clear that
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Ms. Davis just lacked the authority that would have been

2

sufficient to trigger vicarious liability.

3

think the paradigm case where that authority is present

4

is something like the lifeguard in Silverman where they

5

control all aspects of the daily activities, one's

6

schedule, one's daily work assignments, and down the

7

line.

8
9

And again we

Here there is no evidence that any of that
authority that was possessed, and the record makes clear

10

beyond doubt that all that authority was possessed by

11

others, Ms. -- the chef and Mr. Kimes.

12

And I think, as the amicus brief makes

13

clear, this is consistent with workplaces across America

14

today, where jobs are less hierarchical, more

15

collaborative, and so where you have got more senior

16

employees by virtue of their experience or job title,

17

just a paper title, are in a broad sense team leaders of

18

the like in the workplace.

19

That doesn't mean they are supervisors in

20

any traditional sense, and it certainly doesn't mean

21

they are supervisors for purposes of triggering

22

vicarious liability under Title VII.

23

So for those reasons, we would urge this

24

Court to affirm the judgment below, to make clear in

25

52
Alderson Reporting Company

appeals and the assumption that something like the EEOC

that standard.

The Seventh Circuit rule is not one that can

be justified in terms of its superior judicial

manageability, administrability, despite producing a few

17

odd results.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Someone who can tell

Well, if you adopted that

53
Alderson Reporting Company

1

rule I suppose you could couple it with an increased

2

duty of care on the part of the employer to take

3

necessary steps to prevent forbidden harassment.

4

other words, you up the duty of care on the part of the

5

employer generally.

6

MR. ORTIZ:

In

Well, Justice Kennedy, that in

7

fact is one thing the Seventh Circuit has tried to do,

determined by a jury only after hearing a particular

11

case.

12

14

saying directing and leading somehow don't count because

2

mentioned only that it was an allegation in the

3

complaint.

4

This Court in its Faragher opinion

5

complainant was that he said that, not that Silverman

6

7

case that he actually wasn't interested in even dating

8

Faragher, it was just a way of humiliating her in the

9

workplace.

14

be sending to litigants in the future if it were to

15

affirm, simply affirm here.

16

anyone is thinking that they may want to challenge a

17

rule, no matter how well-settled it is in a particular

circuit, they would have an incentive to, through

19

discovery, to produce information that might be relevant
