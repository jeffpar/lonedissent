Mr. Estrada.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The Third Circuit held in this case that the

12

assessment of the adequacy of expert evidence offered in

13

support of class certification is a merits question that

14

has no place in the class certification inquiry.

15

According to the Third Circuit and to the

16

plaintiffs in this Court, what is sufficient is for the

17

proponents of class certification to point to some

18

abstract methodology, such as econometrics or regression

19

analysis, that conceivably might be applied to the

20

problem at hand in a way in which, in the fullness of

21

time, will evolve into admissible evidence by the time

22

of the class trial.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Estrada, you are

24

limiting your argument to the determination of damages,

25

as I understand it.

MR. ESTRADA:

I think you limited my

argument to determination of damages, Justice Ginsburg.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because the -- because

5

the Third Circuit agreed that, as far as any antitrust

6

impact --

MR. ESTRADA:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

established on a class basis.

10

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes.
-- that could be

We -- we, obviously -- as is

11

obvious from our cert petition, we do not agree with

12

that.

13

question in this Court, I think we have to assume that

14

that is so.

15

outcome with --

16

For purposes of inquiring into the damages

I think it doesn't change the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why -- why not?

17

Because, generally -- and at least it's my impression --

18

that in class certifications, if the liability question

19

can be adjudicated on a class basis, then the damages

20

question may be adjudicated individually.

21

Take a -- take a Title VII case.

A

22

liability -- a pattern of practice of discrimination,

23

therefore, liability, but damages can be assessed on an

24

individual basis.

25

here?

So why isn't bifurcation possible

4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, let me make two points

2

in response to that question, Justice Ginsburg:

3

about what the legal standards are, and -- you know, the

4

second one, which is as important, about what the record

5

in this case is.

6

One

With respect to the first point, what the

7

rule asks us to look at is not questions of damages

8

versus liability, but whether the common questions

9

predominate over those that are individual to the class

10
11

members.
I don't disagree, and it is not my position

12

today that there may be cases in which individual

13

damages questions are consistent with class

14

certification.

15

it is not the case that all damages questions may -- may

16

remain individual consistently with class certification.

17

But as the lower courts have recognized,

Indeed, the 1966 advisory notes expressly

18

say that questions of damages with respect to class

19

members may or may not predominate in cases like this;

20

i.e., antitrust class actions.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let --

But, Mr. Estrada, doesn't

22

Justice Ginsburg's question actually point out that

23

the -- the law that both district court and the

24

circuit court used in this case was actually quite

25

favorable to you?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Unlike some courts, both the district court

2

and the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to

3

show that there was a class-wide measurement of damages.

4

And then in addition, both courts said, really, it

5

was -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate

6

that that class-wide measure of damages existed.

7

Now, I understand that you have problems

8

with the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden.

9

You say that they didn't meet that burden.

But it seems

10

to me that the legal standard that was used was exactly

11

the legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs

12

had to come in and show, by a preponderance, that they

13

had a class-wide way to measure damages in this case.

14

MR. ESTRADA:

I don't think that's right,

15

Justice Kagan.

16

about whether the district court did what you just

17

finished saying.

18

the court of appeals did so because, repeatedly,

19

throughout its opinion, said that the questions as to

20

the adequacy of whether they had complied with the

21

Hydrogen Peroxide Standard was a merits question that

22

was for later adjudication in this case.

23

I think we can have a healthy debate

I think there can be no debate that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, here's what the

24

district court said.

"The experts' opinions raise

25

substantial issues of fact and credibility that we are
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

required to resolve to decide the pending motion."

2

is the motion for class certification.

3

That

"Having rigorously analyzed the experts'

4

reports, we conclude that the class has met its burden

5

to demonstrate that the element of antitrust impact is

6

capable of proof at trial through evidence that is

7

common to the class and that there is a common

8

methodology available to measure and quantify damages on

9

a class-wide basis."

10

So that seems to me exactly what you say

11

they should have done.

12

ultimate determination, but not with the statement of

13

the law.

14

MR. ESTRADA:

Now, you disagree with their

Well, I think that it is true

15

that our position in the district court was that

16

Hydrogen Peroxide controlled and that the district court

17

correctly stated the holding of the Third Circuit ruling

18

in that case.

19

Beyond that, I don't think that we do agree,

20

because, in the Third Circuit, once the case got there,

21

we got a rule of law saying that, although this court

22

prescribed the rule amendment, 23(f), precisely to

23

enable courts of appeals to review whether the district

24

court got it right for important policy questions, that

25

the job of the court of appeals under 23(f) can be fully
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discharged by saying that providence will provide; we'll

2

think about it in the morning.

3

consistent with the proposition that the correct law was

4

applied in the lower courts.

5

And that is not

Furthermore, although the district court did

6

enounce the correct standard in reflecting the holding

7

of Hydrogen Peroxide, it is far from apparent -- and

8

this is part of our point to the Third Circuit -- excuse

9

me -- to the Third Circuit -- which was not actually

10

heard on the merits, that what he did was different from

11

simply saying that econometrics and regression analysis

12

are well-established methodologies for dealing with

13

problems of this kind.

14

And I will ask you to -- to look at the top

15

of page 145 of the Pet. App., where you can look at

16

discussions -- no, I'm sorry, it's 131, in footnote

17

24 -- where the district court made clear that his

18

understanding of the capable class-wide proof involved

19

the inquiry whether the plaintiffs actually had evidence

20

that reflected the methodologies that had been used in

21

this case -- in these kinds of cases.

22

He says, "It is undisputed that multiple

23

regression analysis is an acceptable and widely

24

recognized statistical tool for cases of this kind."

25

So at a very general level, I don't have a
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

disagreement with you that, in many cases where there is

2

error, the district court started out with the right

3

foot.

4

either was applied by the district court or was even

5

attempted by the court of appeals.

I don't agree with you that the correct standard

6

Now, if we were to go to the merits of the

7

question -- and to answer -- you know, the second part

8

of the question that I started out with

9

Justice Ginsburg -- keep in mind that, even on the

10

assumption that the district court accepted that there

11

was common class proof of antitrust impact, that is not

12

the same as accepting -- and I don't think the district

13

court accepted -- that there was common class-wide proof

14

that the impact for every individual was the same.

15

And that is a key point about what the

16

theory of impact here was.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It doesn't have to be the

18

same for every member of the class.

As the dissenting

19

judge pointed out, you can have subclasses.

20

MR. ESTRADA:

Well -- and I'm happy to also

21

deal with that question.

22

which -- you know, the variances of the classes can be

23

dealt with, with subclasses.

24

side has actually asserted here that the record would

25

allow this.

There are cases, indeed, in

No one on the plaintiffs'

And Mr. Jordan pointed out there is
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

considerable basis for skepticism in thinking that that

2

could ever be accomplished because we are talking about

3

649 franchise areas with different competitive

4

conditions.

5

But if you go back to -- to the theory of

6

impact -- and the theory of impact was that RCN, this

7

putative overbuilder, was -- you know, the little engine

8

that could, that it was going to radiate out to the

9

entire DMA area and completely overbuild the area.

So

10

the theory of impact was, if you drop a stone in the

11

water, you are going to have ripples all the way out, so

12

you have ripples as to every member of the class.

13

doesn't mean that every ripple is the same.

14

It

So -- so that the key question for the

15

damages issue in front of you now is whether what

16

McClave came up with was an adequate methodology for

17

measuring the size of the ripple --

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I did -- are there cases

19

in the -- in the ordinary course of class actions -- I

20

know they are all different -- where the district court

21

can find that common questions do predominate, without

22

addressing the question whether damages can be proven on

23

a class-wide basis?

24
25

Or are they always interlinked?

MR. ESTRADA:

No, I think the text of

(b)(20) -- of (b)(3) expressly requires that questions,
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

whether they be damages or liability that are common to

2

the class, predominate over those that are individual as

3

to class members.

4

not arguing -- that the mere fact that there may be

5

individual damages questions precludes class

6

certification.

7

And I -- I fully accept -- and I am

I am actually arguing for the flip side of

8

that issue, which is that just because it -- it may not

9

be preclusive in certain cases doesn't mean that it is

10
11

preclusive in no case.
I would refer the Court to the Fifth

12

Circuit's opinion by Judge Garwood in the Bell v. AT&T

13

case, which was, like this, an antitrust case, where the

14

Fifth Circuit acknowledged that, in many of these cases,

15

it's almost hornbook law that there may be individual

16

issues that would not preclude class cert, but that

17

there are certain cases in which -- you know, the theory

18

of injury and -- and the proof that would be needed to

19

make it out is so sui generous and individualized --

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I completely agree

21

with hornbook law.

Three pipe manufacturers get

22

together and, in January, fix their prices, all right?

23

MR. ESTRADA:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.
Fourteen wholesalers want

to show that, and each has different damages because
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they bought different amounts of pipe.

2

MR. ESTRADA:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Right.
Hornbook law:

Certify the

class and leave the damages issues for later.

5

MR. ESTRADA:

Right.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

This case, this case,

7

hornbook law:

Section 2 forbids monopolization.

It is

8

absolutely clear Comcast has that power.

That's why

9

they're -- that's why they're regulated.

And, indeed,

10

they engage in things that show that they did not

11

achieve that through skill, foresight, and industry.

12

What things?

And now, we have a list of

13

four.

And the district court says exactly what?

14

prove monopolization, which is relevant to all these

15

people in the class, then what we do is we later look

16

into how much that monopolization raised the prices

17

above competitive levels.

18

at the competitive levels and look at what happened over

19

here, and there we are, it will help.

20

If we

And I offer a model to look

Okay?

Now, hornbook law, whether that's so or not

21

so is a matter for later, but see first if there is

22

liability.

23

answer?

24
25

Okay.

That's their argument.

MR. ESTRADA:

What's the

Well, I mean, the answer is --

I will take your first example, and, in fact, I was
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to give -- you know, the example of a case that I

2

had that was similar where -- you know, three plastic

3

cup manufacturers met in -- you know, some airport and

4

fixed -- you know, the prices.

5

Now, this is like saying you fixing -- you

6

know, the price of widgets.

There is a preexisting

7

but-for world, and the question as to who bought what

8

when is not really a question of adjudication, but of

9

computation.

And those are the types of cases where the

10

courts say that the individual damages questions really

11

do not preclude a -- a certification.

12
13

Now, your second example may or may not be
suitable for class treatment.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, here, since what they

15

are saying is they have two theories, Section 1, the

16

agreements to keep other people out of this area are

17

unlawful in themselves.

18

contribute to monopolization.

Question 2 is whether they

19

MR. ESTRADA:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

No, but -- but the question -Now, that's the legal issue

21

of liability.

Now, if they're right, why isn't the

22

measure of damages just what you said?

23

people who are subject to the monopoly power, and we

24

work out how much above the competitive level they had

25

to pay.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

We look to the

5

But the legal -Some paid some; some paid

Sounds the same to me.
MR. ESTRADA:

No, but it isn't because one

6

key point that is missing from the hypothetical,

7

Justice Breyer, is exactly what the theory of liability

8

that is present in this case is, as the case comes to

9

the Court.

10

They had four theories of possible -JUSTICE BREYER:

I saw the four theories,

11

and it seems to me that we are now on the theory of

12

the -- one of the pieces of exclusionary conduct was

13

agreement through various mergers, et cetera, that

14

potential competitors would not come in and compete.

the other one, the number 2.

hypothetical --

actual point of antitrust law, whether these people

7

face today.

9

for later, that these people that already have different

12

competitors.

14

They were not -JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

that they weren't, fine.

18

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, you are right -You have the right to prove

I just said that.

But the

19

point is that, as the case comes to the -- to the Court,

20

the question is whether the class that was certified by

21

the district court and validated in its own way by the

22

court of appeals is one that is consistent and fits

23

reliably with the legal theory that the plaintiffs are

24

allowed to pursue --

JUSTICE BREYER:

And this does, too -­

15
Alderson Reporting Company

their case, the question on damages is to what extent

nonetheless, let me express no view on that.

so prosaic.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. ESTRADA:

No, you shouldn't.

And you mentioned something --

20

something so contrary to the facts, but the fact is that

21

the fundamental question here is that there is one

22

theory they are permitted to pursue.

23

overbuilder, RCN, would have radiator -- radiated out

24

through the DMA area.

25

It is that this

Now, you may think that they should have
16
Alderson Reporting Company

1

been allowed to pursue some other different theory.

2

It's not the case that you have in front of you.

3

the fact is that -- that -- that as the case comes to

4

the Court, the theory that remains is based on the

5

proposition that RCN was going to be the overbuilder

6

that -- that was going to impact prices.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8

MR. ESTRADA:

9

Two things follow from that.

And

Well, two --

Well, Mr. -If I could just finish?
You know, the

10

first one which is directly pertinent to the issue here

11

is that the McClave model purported to compute damages

12

that were not limited to overbuilding and that, in fact,

13

expressly measured overbuilding only as to 5 out of the

14

16 counties.

15

legal theory that stays in the case.

16

The damage model just does not fit the

The second aspect of it is that, as a

17

question of the factual fit with the record in the case,

18

the transactions that added the largest number of

19

subscribers here occurred in 2000 and very early 2001.

20

The record in this case includes public announcements by

21

RCN, repeated by the FCC in its competition review, that

22

they were not going to franchise any new franchises.

23

there is a basic question of lack of fit between the ipse

24

dixit of the expert and -- you know, the record in this case.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Estrada, as -- as the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

case comes to the Court, I guess I wonder why any of

2

this is relevant.

3

mentioned earlier that we reformulated the question

4

presented in this case.

5

which said that what we wanted to talk about was whether

6

a district court at a class certification stage has to

7

conduct a Daubert inquiry, in other words, has to decide

8

on the admissibility of expert testimony relating to

9

class-wide damages.

10

You mentioned earlier -- you

And we reformulated in a way

And -- you know, it would not be crazy to

11

surmise that we reformulated the question because we

12

wanted to present -- we wanted to decide a legal

13

question, rather than a question about who was right as

14

to this particular expert's report and how strong it

15

was.

16

your clients waived their -- their argument that this

17

was inadmissible evidence.

And it turns out that, as to that legal question,

18

So -- so what do we do in that circumstance?

19

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I don't agree with you

20

that we waived.

12

But the issue still was, both in the district court and

13

in the court of appeals, one that we urged that the

14

methodology was not relevant and did not --

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The district court,

16

Mr. Estrada, clearly understood you to be making an

17

argument about weight and not about admissibility.

18

indeed, the district court in open court -- and -- and

19

it's in the transcript -- suggests that it's doing

20

something different from holding a Daubert hearing,

21

explains how it's different from holding a Daubert

22

hearing, and both lawyers agree to that statement.

23

MR. ESTRADA:

And

Well, but I think we -- we

24

agree that he needed to conduct more than a Daubert

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Circuit in American Honda, that the question at the

2

class cert hearing is not solely one of whether the

3

evidence would be admissible, but also one of -- of

4

whether the district judge himself is persuaded that

5

this is class-wide proof that has not been impeached in

6

his own mind.

7

And so -- you know, the mere fact that we

8

all understood that what should have been ruled on at

9

the class cert hearing encompassed more than pure

10

Daubert admissibility, is actually part of our complaint

11

here.

12

I mean, I think, if you read what the

13

district court did, he basically looked at his job as

14

looking at whether the model was capable, as in

15

literally capable, of -- of -- of establishing -- you

16

know, the facts that the plaintiffs say it establishes,

17

without really weighing in his own mind whether it had

18

been shown to be fit and -- you know, reliable.

that the Court should then infer that there is an

objection to admissibility of evidence, as opposed,

again, to the weight and strength of evidence.

5

I mean, surely, a district court confronted

6

with an argument about the weight and strength of

Where is the line that

MR. ESTRADA:

There are two things that the

district court has to do, and both involve an assessment

12

of the validity or, as you would put it, probity of the

expert evidence -- you know, the first one keeps in mind

that the focus of the class certification hearing is to

15

decide whether the -- this case should be tried as a

class.

17

And therefore, the first question that the

18

district court has to ask is, even if I think that this

19

is not ready now, do they have a methodology that

20

sufficiently fits the facts and is reliably based on a

21

scientific method, so that these people will be capable

That's the way you put the

Daubert question.

MR. ESTRADA:

I was -- I was going to point

out, by reference to one of your opinions,

Justice Scalia, that there is a question sort of based

9

on the Williams case, 504 U.S., as to -- you know, the

10

extent to which these issues are open to the Respondent

11

to challenge as well.

12

Because by the time we framed the cert

Daubert, it was abundantly clear, as we pointed out in

MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, you are

8

exactly right.

The petition for certiorari was framed

9

not, as counsel just misspoke, in terms of Daubert, but

10

it was framed in terms of whether you have to go into --

11

whether the district court and the court of appeals have

12

to deal with merits issues, and that question was what

13

was reformulated.

And to get a sense of how profoundly

weight and probativeness, as opposed to admissibility,

which is the question before this Court, they never,

questions in the case is this:

There was a question to

Mr. Estrada with reference to a jury trial.

23

24

gate -- what do you call it -- a gatekeeper function

25

here.

There is no -- there's no jury.

But

1

And if the judge admits the evidence and if

2

it turns out that that doesn't meet the standard of

3

reliability, then he can exclude it.

4

see why the judge has to say, all right, now, first, I'm

5

going to do Daubert, and next, I'm going to do whether

6

this is reliable.

8

I don't -- I don't

This is just a magic words approach, it
seems to me.

9

MR. BARNETT:

I don't think it is a magic

10

word approach at all, Your Honor, because it has

11

tremendous significance to people who are actually

12

litigating the case.

13

disrespectful to a district judge not to object on

14

Daubert grounds and then complain that what he did was

15

completely unusable in the court.

16

It's -- I submit that it is

They cited Daubert and Rule 702, 50 -- I

17

quit counting at 50, but it was only after the -- the

18

question was reframed not to deal with merits questions,

19

but to deal with Daubert specifically.

22

qualified.

Petitioner says it doesn't.

5

also the case that the judge saying, do you have any

objections to this witness as an expert, that's about as

7

big an invitation you can get that, if you have got a

8

Daubert objection, you better make it now -- you need to

make it now.

expert's testimony is persuasive?

19

being used are probative and relevant, sufficient to

with that proposition if there is a proper objection

5

of the basic misconceptions that this case comes into

7

Dr. McClave was talking about a causal connection

between the anticompetitive conduct and the damages.

He was estimating, whatever the -- whatever

10

the anticompetitive conduct is, whatever the judge or

11

jury finds is the anticompetitive conduct that accounts

12

for the sky-high prices throughout the Philadelphia

area -- whatever it is, this is an accurate reflection

14

of the damages on a class-wide basis aggregated across

the class.

16

The -- Comcast -JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

And, Your Honor -And as it turns out, only

one of those was found to -- to be in the game.

I do want to make sure I -- I

24

make the connection.

Dr. Williams was the one who

25

talked about this -- not Dr. McClave.
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Dr. Williams was

the one who said this is the anticompetitive conduct,

and this is what caused there to be less competition.

It was Dr. McClave's job to figure out, well, what's the

4

harm to the class as a result of that chain of events?

5

You are right, Your Honor, that --

claims.

about what the anticompetitive conduct was.

MR. BARNETT:

am being precise about this, Justice Scalia.
36
Alderson Reporting Company

There is

Official

1

no question that the conduct that caused the harm is the

2

clustering behavior that Comcast engaged in over a

3

decade's time.

4

What is not clear -- was not clear, but is

5

now, because Judge Padova has told us, which of the

6

mechanisms that Dr. Williams formulated as possible

7

causes of the -- the possible engines that resulted in

8

the prices going way up.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I guess, in a

10

monopolization case, it is not the case that you have to

11

trace the damages to the exclusionary conduct.

12

MR. BARNETT:

Exactly.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

In a classical class

14

of -- Section 2 case, the damages are caused by the

15

monopolization, which lacks skill, foresight, and

And because it's a

Then, if that were true, from looking at the

It's in -- actually in the court of appeals

2

record AO 01533 through 34, it is stated there that you

3

can take off of the DBS -- if you don't like the DBS

4

penetration screen, then you can turn it off, and

5

damages are still, as we have established since -- when

6

Comcast -- when they finally did file a Daubert motion,

7

would be something like $550 million on a class-wide

8

basis.

9

So that is in the record, as well as there

10

is ample evidence, Exhibit 82, which shows 23 different

11

iterations of the damages models, including damages

12

models that Dr. Chipty on the Comcast side put together,

13

slicing and dicing all of this data to show that, no

14

matter how you slice it and dice it, almost, if you did

15

it in any kind of a fair way that the Federal Judicial

16

Center recognizes as a reliable type of methodology, you

17

are going to have significant damages across the class

18

for each class member throughout the time period.

The other thing I would like --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I am still in search of a

legal question that anybody disagrees about here.

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, I read before the

5

district court statement of the standard, now all points

6

of the circuit court statement of the standard, where

7

the circuit court says, "The inquiry for a district

8

court at the class certification stage is whether the

9

plaintiffs have demonstrated" -- burden is on you -- "by

10

a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able

11

to measure damages on a class-wide basis using common

12

proof."

13

The parties both agree with that statement

14

of the standard.

15

both agree -- and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's

16

question -- that if the Daubert question had not been

17

waived, that if -- if Comcast had objected to the

18

admissibility of this expert report, that, indeed, the

19

court would -- should have held a hearing on the

20

admissibility of the expert report.

21

It seems to me that the parties also

So this is a case where it seems to me that,

22

except for the question of how good the expert report

23

is, none of the parties have any adversarial difference

24

as to the appropriate legal standard.

25

usually, we decide cases based on disagreements about

MR. BARNETT:

I -- I do not, Your Honor, and

5

I think Justice -- Judge Padova got it exactly right.

6

You read the -- the standard that he applied.

7

if anything, it's a tougher standard than should be the

8

test.

happy about it, and we don't disagree with Mr. Estrada.

10

In fact,

But we're -- we embrace that test and we are

And this is what I was about to change

11

subject to a little bit, the two misconceptions that

12

fundamentally affect Comcast's view of the world --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, before you do that,

14

let me ask a question related to what Justice Kagan just

15

asked.

16

reformulated, I take it your answer would be that a

17

district court under those circumstances may not certify

18

a class action; is that right?

If we were to answer the question presented as

MR. BARNETT:

If there is a proper

objection, properly and timely presented, it's preserved

up through the appellate courts and all the things that

22

you need to do in order to be fair to the judge, as well

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then the only

2

remaining question is whether the issue was in the case

3

as a factual -- as a matter of the record here; isn't

4

that right?

5

MR. BARNETT:

Well, if the issue of

6

admissibility is in the case, I don't think it is.

If

7

evidence comes in -- again, this is -- this was not a

8

bunch of expert reports that were just piled up on

9

the -- in chambers, and Judge Padova went through them.

10

He actually, at their request, had a four-day hearing,

11

and then a fifth day, where he posed a series -- I think

12

it was a four-page letter where the judge says, I'm

13

concerned about this, I'm concerned about that, y'all

14

come back and tell me why it's okay.

15

And what --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17
18

Well, could this report be

probative if it did not satisfy Daubert?
MR. BARNETT:

The answer, Your Honor -- and

19

my source is Section 274 of Trial and Corpus Juris

20

Secundum, well-recognized in this Court, no doubt.

21

says that, if it's in the record, if it comes in

22

unobjected to, it has whatever probative value the

23

court -- the trier-of-fact chooses to place on it.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It

That the court as the

trier-of-fact chooses to -- that the -- not reserved to
42

cases where there's a jury?

2

MR. BARNETT:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is that --

No, Your Honor.
It seems to me that, as I

4

indicated before, that the whole question of weight and

5

admissibility is somewhat less important when the trial

6

judge is not the gatekeeper.

7

end of the day, can hear the testimony and say, you

8

know, I admitted this testimony, but it doesn't make any

9

sense, it doesn't work.

10

MR. BARNETT:

The trial judge, at the

What's happening, Your Honor,

11

is you have got to satisfy -- Rule 23(b)(3) says the

12

judge has to make findings.

13

parts of Rule 23 that talks about findings.

14
15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's one of the few

Well, he does what I said,

but then he has 100 pages of findings.

16

MR. BARNETT:

Yes, Your Honor.

But he's --

17

he's acting as a gatekeeper, and what he's doing -- or

18

she's doing is projecting, what's this trial going to

19

look like, based on the evidence in front of me?

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, I think that's where

21

we disagree.

22

that, in his view, the -- the class can be certified.

23
24
25

The judge has to make a determination

MR. BARNETT:

Absolutely.

He does.

And

if -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that includes some

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

factual inquiries as -- as to the damages alleged and

2

the cause of the injury and whether or not there is a

3

common -- whether or not there's a commonality.

4

MR. BARNETT:

The -- Justice Kennedy, the

5

district judge asks, prove to me -- to the plaintiff,

6

that you can prove it at trial, prove to me now that, at

7

trial, you will be able to submit a damages model that

8

passes muster, under Daubert or whatever test there is,

9

depending on what the objections are.

10

So the judge is acting in a gatekeeper role,

11

right then, kind of projecting into the future about

12

what am I going to do when the jury's in the box --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's not -- I'll

14

think about it, but that's not my understanding.

15

thought the judge has to make a determination that, in

16

the next case we are going to hear this morning, that

17

the representation is material or it affects the market.

18

The judge has to make that conclusion, make that

19

finding.

20

MR. BARNETT:

I

And the finding that the judge

21

makes, based on preponderance of the evidence,

22

plaintiffs have shown to me that, more likely than not,

23

at trial, plaintiffs will be able to show, on a

24

class-wide basis, some evidence, enough to get a verdict

25

that could be upheld, enough that satisfies to some
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidence or whatever the test is at trial, that shows

2

damages on a class-wide basis.

3

So the judge isn't saying, this is it, you

4

can't fix it, you can't change it, you can't modify it,

5

you can't enhance it between now and trial.

6

that you can do it.

11

it.

12

And this is where -- I really want to get to

13

this about the merits.

14

deal of confusion about what Judge Aldisert meant in the

15

Third Circuit when he talked about the merits.

16

This -- I think there is a great

Comcast, each time construes, when he uses

17

the word "merits," talk about incantation of magic

words, that that means whether it's good or bad, that

19

that is what Judge Aldisert was talking about.

20

not what he was talking about at all.

21

about trial on the merits.

22

now, we don't have to decide whether this model is

23

perfect.

24
25

That is

He was talking

He was saying that, right

It's enough.
The test -- this issue isn't before us

because it's been waived, Daubert and all that, but if

you want to know what our observation would be, if this

2

were presented in a proper case, then observation is it

3

doesn't have to be perfect, and it can be enhanced

5

practicable time -- and trial, so that the jury can see

it.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, of course, there

20

matters for the trier of fact to determine at the merits

stage, but under -- under Daubert and under Rule 702,

22

the judge has to say that the evidence is relevant to

23

the task at hand, and it has a reliable foundation.

issues that the dissenting judge raised, including the

8

overbuilding screen, a particular kind of market screen,

mathematical averages.

If -- in the DBS penetration

10

screen, if he had raised any of those, if there had been

a whisper of a hint of a suggestion, of a thought, of

those things in the district court, we'd have been

all over that.

false, that those -- that those statements are untrue.

eliminated from the sample, and you still have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL ESTRADA
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

Let me -- let me start with the proposition

12

which I continue to find startling, that a damages model

13

can stand up to examination on the theory that it is not

14

linked to any theory of anticompetitive conduct.

15

the theory seems to be that what the McClave model is

16

intended to do is to isolate competitive markets

17

elsewhere that are competitive in some sense, come to

18

the conclusion that the Philadelphia DMA is somehow less

19

competitive, and charge whatever the expert says is the

20

difference to Comcast.

Now,

21

But that has a fundamental failure, as a

22

matter of substantive antitrust law, because we know

23

from cases from this Court and the court of appeals

24

going back to Story Parchment, that the one requirement

25

is that causation link of the damages -- you know, it
53

has to be certainly linked to illegal conduct.
