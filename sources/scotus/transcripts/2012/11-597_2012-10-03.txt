Fish Commission v. The United States.

Mr. Goodhart.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GOODHART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. GOODHART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The issue is whether temporary flooding can

12

ever constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment.

13

Federal Circuit said, no, never, ruling that the

14

permanent consequences of the Government's actions were

15

not relevant solely because its actions were not

16

permanent.

17
18
19

The

Respectfully, Your Honors, that cannot be
the rule.

There are at least two reasons why.
First, the United States must provide just

20

compensation when its direct physical invasion

21

substantially intrudes upon a landowner's protected

22

property interest, regardless of the particular mode or

23

duration of that invasion.

24
25

And, second, the Federal Circuit's decision
conflicts with fundamental guarantees that the Takings
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Clause is intended to preserve, and, therefore, is

2

manifestly unjust.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about this Court's

4

precedent in, what is it, the Sanguinetti case, where

5

the Court said that for there to be Government

6

responsibility it is at least necessary that the

7

overflow constitute a permanent invasion of the land

8

amounting to an appropriation, not merely an injury, to

9

property?
We would have to withdraw or modify that

10
11

statement, would we not, if you -- if your -- your

12

argument prevails?

13

MR. GOODHART:

Justice Ginsburg, we would

14

say that you would not have to overrule Sanguinetti

15

because the language there, "permanent flooding

16

invasion," was -- was not how the case turned on the

17

result.

18

of the early flood-taking cases -- Pumpelly, Lynah, and

19

Kress.

22

requirement.

could not have temporary flood invasions.

But, Your Honor --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Was Sanguinetti -- had we

Alderson Reporting Company

1

had any temporary takings cases before Sanguinetti?

2

MR. GOODHART:

Justice Scalia --

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In other words, was

4

Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or

5

was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a

6

temporary taking?

7

dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been

8

overruled by our later temporary takings cases.

9

If the latter, that dictum if it's

MR. GOODHART:

Justice Scalia, there --

10

you're correct.

There was no temporary takings prior to

11

Sanguinetti.

12

address temporary flooding, whether that could

13

constitute a taking.

14

Sanguinetti that have actually addressed whether a

15

direct temporary invasion will -- that substantially

16

intrudes upon property interests have held that, yes,

17

you can have a temporary --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

The Court there didn't have occasion to

And all of the cases after

Which ones?

Because I

19

counted eleven cases which either say, state, some seem

20

to hold or support the proposition that when it's

21

temporary with a flood it's a trespass, and where it's

22

permanent it's a taking.

23

Okay?

I mean, I have eleven.

24

my law clerk.

25

the ones that say the opposite?

And so I've got from

And then I tried to see, well, what are
And so far we've come

up with zero.

2

All right?

You could argue that there were three cases

3

during the war which might be read that way, though they

4

don't quite mention it.

All right?

5

So which of the cases that you -- rather

6

than list my eleven, I'm more interested in what you

7

think, and so I'd like to know which are the ones you

8

think support -- with something like a flood, which it's

9

not -- you're not physically taking hold of the whole

10

thing.

You're sending something in that comes back.

11

Which of the ones support you that temporary is not a

12

trespass, temporary is a taking?

13

MR. GOODHART:

Justice Breyer, in the

14

Dickinson case in 1947 where the Court found a taking

15

from flooding, Mr. Dickinson reclaimed his property,

16

effectively reclaimed most of the property that had

17

flooded, effectively ending the flood invasion.

18

Court there said the taking was a taking when that

19

occurred, regardless of whether the landowner does

20

reclamation.

21

And the

Of course, this Court in the war seizure

22

cases, in General Motors, Petty Motor, Pewee Coal,

23

Kimball Laundry, in all of those cases the Court has

24

found --

They took the laundry

7

8

9

whole thing.

10

MR. GOODHART:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem with a flood is

12

you don't take all the land.

13

And the stuff is there for a while, and then it comes

14

back, and -- it's called water.

15

actually appropriate the property.

4

Justice Breyer has talked about.

MR. GOODHART:

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- the

6

United States flooded the air over the Causby's

7

residence and commercial chicken farm.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but in Causby, what

they did -- there was a question about whether just

10

flying some airplanes over is a taking or a trespass.

11

But it went on for 25 years, so it was a long time.

12

And, therefore, the permanency of it I don't think is at

13

issue there.

14

MR. GOODHART:

Yes.

Your Honor, in this

15

case, the court -- the Court of Federal Claims found

16

that these deviations resulted, in over 8 years, 6

17

consecutive years of recurring flood invasions during --

18

during the summertime, during unnatural time periods;

19

and that the facts were more compelling than even in

20

Causby with the -- the overflights or in Portsmouth

22

Portsmouth Landing Harbor Hotel.

year for specific sustained time periods.

The legal analysis is the same.

We didn't have that in our

We had intrusion during 1993 to 2000, 8

7

years, 6 of which were substantially throughout the

8

summer where this management area sat in water during

June, July, into August, basically, stagnated water that

10

choked the oxygen from the roots of these trees.

11

1999 it was termed a brownout.

12

And in

It was massive.

Once the timber inventory was done, it

13

revealed that there was over 100,000 trees in a

14

6,990-acre area that were either destroyed or were --

15

were in the process of dying.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And that didn't include

Counsel, all of our

18

cases in this temporary versus permanent, as I read the

19

cases and I read what the multiple facts that each are

20

relying on, it seems to me that our cases have been

21

attempting, in the term "temporary," to encompass a lot

22

of different concepts.

23

accidental issue is not a taking; causation:

3

And they are using that in a multifaceted

4

test, one that the Solicitor General is not trying to

5

endorse here, but one that I think is more consistent

6

with our general jurisprudence in this area.

7

So there is never a simple answer on the

8

question of permanent damage, because you can have

9

permanent damage that's not a taking, if all of the

other factors I've just mentioned are not in your favor.

finding that there is a more urgent and -- and a higher

7

priority for other lands, and it changes its policy?

its law, the National Environmental Policy Act, the

pay for what it's going to take from private landowners.

13
14
15

It can make changes, and then it can

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, what you're saying

is that it can't make that change without paying, right?
MR. GOODHART:

It -- it cannot make that

16

change where it's going to burden the landowner and

17

interfere with that -- those property rights that the

18

Fifth Amendment is guaranteeing.

Now, in practice --

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now suppose, at the very

21

outset of the dam, the -- the Government says, we've got

to put this water someplace, we're going to put it on

would have happened if the dam was never built?
MR. GOODHART:

Perhaps, Your Honor.

And in

22

this case, for example, the court had evidence that this

23

land flourished before the dam.

24

this bottomland hardwood forest existed for generations.

25

And when the control plan was put in effect in 1953, it

worked fine because they mimicked natural flow where

2

late -- late winter and early spring, you have your

3

releases, they dissipate, the water recedes, but you

4

don't have extensive summertime flooding from a river.

5

Frankly, anywhere in the country, but

6

certainly not in the southern part of the United States,

7

these rivers do not overflow during June, July, August.

8

This never happens.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what do you suggest --

what do you suggest -- I looked at the consent.

11

MR. GOODHART:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

To tell you the truth, I

13

think it's permanent.

I think they're thinking it's

14

intermittent, but permanently intermittent.

15

MR. GOODHART:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

The flood comes like three

17

months a year every year.

And the erosion, they say

18

that part that's eroded belongs to the Government now.

19

And if he comes back with his dirt and puts it in,

20

that's fine, but he's trespassing on Government land.

21

So if I'm right in reading that, if I'm

22

right -- and a big if -- it seems that eleven cases

23

somewhat stand for this, I agree, somewhat arbitrary

24

rule.

5

clearer rule for compensating for flooding where our

6

problem is what's a trespass and what's a taking?

7

8

cannot be the Federal circuit's rule that you can never

9

have temporary flooding as a taking.

I would --

a substitute that would be better?

MR. GOODHART:

Your Honor, the substitute

22

would be to remain consistent with how this Court

23

analyzes the physical takings, not use anything from

24

regulatory analysis here, but looking at these elements.

25

And the -- the Corps of Engineers will

JUSTICE BREYER:

So a Department of the

7

8

and not a trespass?

9

MR. GOODHART:

That's a taking

No, Your Honor, it's not.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. GOODHART:

Because?
And because the Court said in

12

the Cress case, it's the character of the Government's

13

action, not the amount of damages resulting from it, so

14

long as that is substantial.
And in the cases, the Court has looked at

15
16

what is substantial intrusion.

17

said a permanent physical occupation on a rooftop in Ms.

18

Loretto's building, small area, that is substantial,

19

even though geographically it was very small, because it

20

cut through these valuable property rights to occupy

21

someone's property.

MR. GOODHART:

Your Honor, I think we would,

4

again, use the analysis, separate out the torts, where

5

the action is direct, it's been predictable what would

6

that would result in, the United States should know

7

that, and then the intrusion or interference with those

8

property rights is substantial, there will be a taking.

9

10

one-time situation, as your hypothetical.

And, again,

The commission couldn't turn it

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So our cases -- our cases

15

treat physical occupations differently from other --

16

from other cases, don't they?

17

The park ranger walking through can hardly

18

be called a physical occupation.

He's harmed the land,

19

but it's not a physical occupation.
What you're -- what you're arguing here is

20
21

that -- is that flooding the land is a physical

22

occupation for the period that it's flooded.

23

MR. GOODHART:

It is, Your Honor.

Where

24

it's an occupation, it's certainly clearer and more

25

intrusive.

There can be invasions that don't amount to

you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two

years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be

a taking.

MR. GOODHART:

You could look at the

economic part -- yes, definitely, Your Honor.

substantial is going to be made as a legal determination

What is

1

please the Court:

2

As has been pointed out, this Court has

3

consistently held in its flooding cases and reaffirmed

4

in Loretto that a -- that a taking occurs in the context

5

of flooding only if the flooding is the direct result of

6

the structure itself and if it results in a permanent

7

effect on the property such that it's an actual

8

appropriation.

9

So --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it's -- there is

10

a little confusion about the Government's position,

11

there was in the court of appeals.

12

Is it -- I'm quoting from your friend's

13

brief, and he says:

categorical rule that temporary Government action can

never be a taking if the Government does not intend to

with our position.

2

But I do want -- there is a critical piece

3

about this case that Justice Kennedy's questions have

4

touched upon that I think it's very important for this

5

Court to focus upon.

6

This case is not about flooding by the

7

project itself.

The reservoir behind the dam, the

8

easements, the flowing easements there, the spillway,

9

the project is the Government and I think it's fair to

10

say the Government is occupying the land when the

11

Government builds the project.

12

What we have here are incidental

13

consequences downstream from the dam as a result of the

14

flowage.

15

up this Court's flooding cases, makes two points.

16

it says it has to be permanent, not temporary invasion;

17

but it also distinguishes the category of cases in which

18

there is conduct outside the landowner's property that

19

has consequential damages within the property.

20

And there are -- Loretto, when it is summing

JUSTICE SCALIA:

One,

I don't -- I don't

21

understand what you're saying.

22

this landowner owned land behind the dam that was

23

temporarily flooded as often as has happened here, that

24

that would be a taking?

25

MR. KNEEDLER:

Are you saying that if

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, I didn't think you were

saying that.

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but what I'm saying is

4

this would be a particularly bad or problematic context

5

for the Court to depart from that.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there are

7

pretty clear findings in the Court of Claims on the

8

question of causation, right?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't think it's a question

10

of causation, and if I could just point out two cases,

11

one of which was cited in Loretto in its summing up of

12

this Court's flooding cases is Bedford.

13

situation in which a revetment, as counsel pointed out,

14

a revetment was constructed in the -- in the Mississippi

15

River to protect erosion and access to the City of

16

Vicksburg.

17

that over time, over a period of 6 years, as in this

18

case, downstream by 6 miles it resulted in permanent

19

flooding of land as a consequence of that.

20

Bedford was a

It was -- it was clearly shown in that case

But what the Court said is that is

21

consequential injury downstream; it is not occupation by

22

the Government.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, so if the

24

Government comes in and tells a landowner downstream

25

that every March and April we are going to flood your
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

property so that you can't use it, from now on, that's

2

the way -- that's part of our plan, that's a taking for

3

those 2 months, correct?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I don't think --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No?

The Government

6

says you will not be able to use your land because of

7

what we are doing for 2 months -- you have been able to

8

up to now, but from now on, for March and April, you

9

can't.

That's not a taking?
MR. KNEEDLER:

10

I don't, and -- and let me

11

explain why.

12

of Engineers operating a dam from which it has to take

13

into account multiple considerations.

14

there was marina operators, there were farmers along the

15

river, there were drainage districts.

16

What we're talking about here is the Corps

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In this case,

I'll grant you that

17

it can decide whose land it wants to take.

18

to know why that's not a taking.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

I just want

Because this is a classic

20

example of the Government adjusting benefits and

21

burdens.

22

in to construct these projects because along -- along

23

the river there was very serious flooding.

24

Government puts in a dam to control the flooding, it has

25

to release the flood waters, and the timing of the

This is why the Federal Government was invited

28
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official

1

release of the flood waters is something that you have

2

to take into account --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if the Government

4

says we've got to release the flood waters and what

5

we're going to do is we're going to have water trucks

6

pull up behind the dam, we're going to load them up and

7

we're going to drive them down river to this person's

8

property and we're going to dump the water there?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think that's a different

10

situation because the Government itself is actually

11

putting the water -- I think that's very close to being

12

the reservoir behind the dam.

13

when the Government -- I think uniformly, when the

14

Government is operating --

15
16
17

But -- but typically,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your answer is

that would be a taking?
MR. KNEEDLER:

I think because it would

18

be -- it would be specifically deposited on that

19

landowner's land.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

It would be the same as if

they put a pipe from the dam --

23

here, right?

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it was not -- there is

11

no suggestion that it was targeted at this land, which

12

is -- which is I think something quite different.

13

was -- this was an incidental consequence of what was

14

happening downstream.

20

it could have been foreseeable in Bedford.

21

This

It was -- it could have been --

Let me take a more -- a more dramatic

22

example that I think illustrates this point.

23

Court's decision in Sponenbarger which we cite in our

24

brief, that a -- that case discusses a prior holding by

25

this Court in a case called Jackson, which was a

Alderson Reporting Company

This

situation where a levee, Government built a levee on one

2

side of the river which had the effect of flooding

3

property on the opposite side of the river because it --

4

it kept it from going to this side and channelled it

5

into the river and it caused it to overflow the -- the

6

land on the other side, and the Court said that is not a

7

taking.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if the

Government decides for purposes of flood control -- I

10

don't know -- I don't know the ecological way -- but the

11

water has to percolate or whatever down in this area.

12

So it goes onto this person's land and it cuts down $5

13

million worth of his trees.

14

in flood control.

The same purpose, to assist

No doubt that that's a taking, right?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18
19

I think that would be -Okay.

Unless there was some

emergency justification.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Sure, sure.

And so

20

the Government then comes down and says, we're going to

21

flood your land and we know -- again, looking at the

22

factual findings -- we know that will result in your

23

trees dying, but because we're doing it for flood

control, that's just too bad.

Court's takings decisions, and specifically those

dealing with effects caused by something outside the

5

property, I think it is basically a per se rule.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, then, suppose what

7

the Government said is, Mr. Smith, you live 150 miles

MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

But that --

Well, but that -- that

is covered by this Court's decision in Cress, in which

flooding, that that's the same thing as a permanent --

is permanently liable.

those effects.

We agree with the -- with the Federal

And -- and here, the context is the

reservoir, but the sort of consequences downstream that

2

affect -- that can affect a whole range of people.

3

And I would like to make one very important

4

point about context, and that is, in 1928, after the

5

Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, Congress first got into

6

the flood control business in a massive way, but it --

7

it -- it was unwilling to do that if it was going to be

8

held liable for consequential damages from flood waters

9

downstream.
It therefore included Section 702(c) in the

10
11

Flood Control Act of 1928, which says that the

12

Government shall not be liable for any damage to any

13

property at any place resulting from floods or flood

14

waters.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, that can't

16

overrule the Takings Clause, can it?

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

I think what it --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, that's nice that

19

Congress doesn't want to be liable.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, but Congress -- no,

22

it's -- the point is more fundamental than that.

23

Congress recognized -- and the legislative history shows

24

this -- Congress recognized that under this Court's

25

precedence, there would not be takings liability.
39
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

Bedford decision is, in fact, cited in that.

2

This Court pointed out in its James

3

decision, which recounts the history of that, that there

4

was a proposal to -- to make the Government responsible

5

under the flood -- flood control projects for any taking

6

or any damage to property.

7

went way beyond anything the Fifth Amendment would

8

require, and it was cut back.

9

not going to be liable for any damage.

And this Court said that

And Congress said it's

And I think that shows a very important

10
11

reliance interest on the part of Congress with respect

12

to the line that this Court has drawn.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Congress was not

What about --

15

Mr. Kneedler, what was wrong with Judge Newman's

16

position on this temporary versus permanent?

17

she said that temporary versus permanent, the target

18

should not be the Government's action, but the effect of

19

that action; that is, if trees are killed and they

20

weren't revived, the damage is permanent.

21

we should vote, not whether the Government is going to

22

do this year after year.

MR. KNEEDLER:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, when -- picking up on

9

what I said about Congress, Congress would not have

10

gotten into the flood control business without this

11

protection of liability.

People --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

I doubt that.

14

said it was an important condition for Congress getting

15

into it, that it was not -- Congress was not going to be

expectations for people downstream from --

your theory.

purchases that land.

whether it falls within the Cress test of whether it is

actions and it's not really the Government's water.

consequence of the project uninhabitable; wouldn't there

That -- that that's in the record, that they

were using this to accommodate the farmers who were

using marginally low property, that the U.S. Fish and

takes away its flood protection and this land goes back

10

to what it would be naturally, then the landowner can't

11

prove that it's direct from the United States.

12

landowner would not recover in that instance.

13

In this situation, the evidence --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

Even though after the

15

dam and the dam's plan was to ensure that it didn't

16

happen, you would still lose?

17

MR. GOODHART:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

If natural conditions --

Your Honor --- would have possibly

caused this, you would lose?
MR. GOODHART:

20

If -- if it's not

21

super-induced invasions directly from the United States,

22

the landowner is going to have that as a natural

23

condition.

24

Summertime flooding of this type never happened in

25

the recorded history.

Here, that was certainly not the case.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Pre-dam.

In the

recorded history.
MR. GOODHART:

In the pre-dam or during the

whole first 40 years of how this was operated.
It was when it was adjusted that the United
States used this land and then took the valuable timber.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure that's not

8

open to dispute.

9

rainfall that was naturally occurring contributed to

10

There is some argument here that

what was happening to the trees.

11

MR. GOODHART:

And I --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think that there is --

13

at least that's what I understood some of the factual

14

argument to be.

15

MR. GOODHART:

No, Your Honor.

I think the

16

record is clear that this was directed naturally,

17

probably without the -- without the interference or

18

addition of nature.

19

Thank you, Your Honor.
