ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The Vaccine Act does not provide for an

11

award of attorneys' fees on a petition that is denied as

12

untimely.

13

fits best with the structure and purposes of the Act,

14

and it's the result that's consistent with the canons of

15

construction that would apply to an award of attorneys'

16

fees out of the Federal Treasury.

17

That's the best reading of the Act's text, it

Now, the -- the textual question here in

18

some sense begins with the statute of limitations, which

19

is in Section 16 of the Act, and which provides that no

20

petition may be filed outside the applicable time

21

period.

22

Now, that provision, like most limitations

23

provisions, doesn't itself actually say what the

24

consequences of the failure to comply with the provision

25

are.

And in some sense, just as in the -- the civil

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 4

1

context, it's not as if the Special Master, upon finding

2

the limitations provision hasn't been complied with, can

3

go back in time and prevent the petition from being

4

filed, just as a civil court can't prevent an action

5

from being commenced, or a suit from being brought, or

6

whatever the limitations provision proscribes.

7

So the question really is going forward,

8

what -- what consequences should there be once the

9

adjudicator decides -- once he or the Special Master

10

decides -- that the limitations period has not been

11

complied with.

12

correspondence between the limitations provision, which

13

says that no petition may be filed, and the attorneys'

14

fee provision, which depends on the existence of a

15

petition filed, that signals that Congress intended the

16

consequences of untimeliness to be visited through the

17

application of the attorneys' fees provision --

And textually speaking, it's the

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Horwich -There are other -- there

20

are other provisions that refer to a petition filed.

21

For example, reporting annually to Congress, publishing

22

a notice in the Federal Register, those both refer to

23

any petition filed.

24

petition filed would include petition filed after the

25

running of the statute of limitations.

And so in those sections at least,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 5

1

MR. HORWICH:

Well, those provisions

2

would -- those provisions by their terms apply at points

3

in the proceedings where we would entirely

4

conventionally accept the -- the claimant's

5

representation that the petition has been filed in

6

accordance with the time limitation.

7

true, certainly in the civil context, that we accept the

8

plaintiff's allegation.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's generally

But don't you -- don't

10

you put in the Federal Register and report to Congress

11

petitions that had been filed out of time?

12

MR. HORWICH:

Well, with respect to -- with

13

respect to reporting to -- to Congress, that's actually

14

an obligation from the Court of Federal Claims, so I

15

can't necessarily speak on their behalf of what they --

16

what they've produced.

17

statistical report.

18
19
20

From what I've seen, it's a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, think about the

Federal Register.
MR. HORWICH:

The Federal -- with respect to

21

the Federal Register provision, I should first say that

22

it has very recently come to my office's attention that

23

the Department of Health and Human Services has not been

24

complying with that provision for the last few years,

25

and they are taking steps to bring themselves in --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 6

1
2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So they don't file

anything in the Federal Register?

3

MR. HORWICH:

Well, it -- they -- they have

4

historically, and let me -- up till about 2009 -- and

5

again, to be clear, they're taking steps to rectify that

6

situation.

7

what they would do -- and this is understandable given

8

the -- the provision that says it's supposed to be

9

published within -- and I believe it's 30 days, that

10

they -- the petitions that are received or that were

11

received at the Department get logged into a computer

12

database, and then a report gets printed out, and they

13

would cross-check them for accuracy against the petition

14

title and forward them to the Office of the Federal

15

Register.

16

But with respect to the period up to 2009,

It's not -- it doesn't -- it wouldn't make

17

sense in a provision that's supposed to be applied

18

essentially upon the filing of the petition, to go into

19

an examination of the timeliness of that -- of that

20

petition.

21

And so we think that provision, just as you

22

would -- just as you would describe in a civil context,

23

you would certainly say that an action that ultimately

24

proves to be held untimely was nonetheless commenced

25

if -- for example, if you imagine a statute of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 7

1

limitations that says no action may be commenced, you

2

wouldn't say the action hadn't been commenced at the

3

time it was pending.

4

we're relying on here.

5

And -- and that's not the argument

What -- rather, what we're relying on is the

6

fact that when you get to the end of the case, which is

7

where the attorneys' fee provision is evidently supposed

8

to apply because --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Horwich, could you say a

10

little bit more about the reporting to Congress

11

provision because that presumably does not happen at the

12

very beginning, but happens more at the end or in the

13

middle.

14

number of untimely petitions from the number that it

15

reports?

16

So do -- does the Department subtract the

MR. HORWICH:

I believe the -- the reporting

17

provision is a -- there's a report that the Special

18

Master is to make to the Court of Federal Claims, and

19

there's a report that the Court of Federal Claims is to

20

deliver and -- and those, from what I have seen --

21

again, the Executive Branch doesn't prepare those

22

because it's the Special Masters and the court that do,

23

but the reports that I have seen, my understanding is

24

that the report of the Special Master is delivered

25

orally to the judges, and so I don't actually know what

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 8

1

the contents of that are.

2

the report that the Court of Federal Claims sends to

3

Congress is a statistical report of all -- actually, of

4

all actions filed in the Court of Federal Claims, that it

5

sends a kind of an omnibus report in satisfaction of --

6
7
8
9

And the report that -- and

JUSTICE KAGAN:

All actions filed, using

"filed" in the normal sense.
MR. HORWICH:

No, no.

I actually mean all

actions filed meaning Vaccine Act actions and otherwise.

10

So it -- it actually doesn't even differentiate the

11

Vaccine Act --

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But is -- is the upshot of

13

your argument then that filing means different things

14

under different provisions of the Act?

15

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think it means --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if that's so, it tends

17

to weaken the force of your reliance on -- on filing in

18

the statute -- on the word "filing" in the statute of

19

limitations section.

20

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I don't think it

21

means -- I don't think it means different things in the

22

Act so much as it means it -- it is to be applied with

23

the understand -- it is to be applied as the -- as a

24

fair stand at the time the provision is applied.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I meant -- I meant

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 9

1

that just to supplement Justice Kagan's question.

2

didn't mean to cut it off.

3

MR. HORWICH:

I

Well, let me -- let me focus

4

for a moment then on the attorneys' fee provision,

5

though, in terms of why -- why that is particularly good

6

reason to think that petitions -- a petition filed is to

7

be considered, in terms of what ought to have been done.

8

And that's because the -- the attorneys' fee provision

9

speaks as of -- it speaks of awards of fees at the time

10

of judgment.

11

limitations issue should have been resolved by that

12

point in the case.

13

And so that time, we know that any

And therefore, it is -- it is an entirely

14

natural -- it's entirely natural to expect that the

15

limitations provision might therefore have some

16

consequences at that stage.

17

In some ways, you can think of it as an

18

application of the old maxim that equity regards as done

19

what ought to have been done.

20

So we're saying to the Special Master, well,

21

if you've gotten to the point at the end of the case

22

where there's a judgment, and you've determined that

23

this petition was forbidden from being filed, in the

24

sense that the limitations provision forbids it, then

25

you should visit the consequences there.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

jurisdictional argument to me.

3

government to be conceding that this statute of

4

limitations is not jurisdictional.

5

processing move.

6

MR. HORWICH:

That sounds like a
But I understand the

It's just a claim

Well, if it sounds like a

7

jurisdictional argument, then I suppose the answer would

8

be for this Court to say that it's jurisdictional, and

9

of course, if that's true, then our position -- our

10
11

position would prevail.
We think on balance, given this Court's

12

precedence most recently in the -- the Auburn Regional

13

Medical Center case, that these -- that this Court did

14

not interpret Congress's time limit provisions to be

15

endowed with jurisdictional significance.

16

mean that it doesn't have any significance.

17

significance of an ordinary affirmative defense, just as

18

it has the significance of the -- the timeliness

19

provision here just has the significance of an ordinary

20

affirmative defense, just as --

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It doesn't
It has the

I just want to make

22

sure I heard you right.

23

jurisdictional, we should say it is, and you win.

24
25

MR. HORWICH:

You said if it sounds

Well, what I was saying --

what I was saying in response to Justice Sotomayor's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 11

1

question is that if -- if it seems that that argument

2

compels you to believe that it's jurisdictional, then

3

the Court should reach the conclusion that it's

4

jurisdictional rather than --

5
6
7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your conclusion

is that it is not jurisdictional.
MR. HORWICH:

We think -- we think that it

8

is not -- we think that it is not, even if the text of

9

it makes it sound like it could have jurisdictional

10

significance, we think on balance, this Court's

11

precedents teach that time -- that time limits are

12

typically claim processing rules, and we don't think

13

that the text overcomes that view.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Assume I accept -So using Federal rules as

16

your model, and Federal rules list statute of

17

limitations as an affirmative defense.

18

that's what it is.

19

certainly it's an affirmative defense to any award of

20

compensation under the Vaccine Act.

21
22
23

Ordinarily,

But is it an affirmative -- well,

But what makes it an affirmative defense to
the award of fees?
MR. HORWICH:

Well, it seems to -- there is

24

not anything in the compensation provision that says

25

that it's an affirmative defense any more than -- in any

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 12

1

way that's more explicit than what we're relying on to

2

say that it's an affirmative defense to attorneys' fees.

3

It's not as if Congress said there -- in another section

4

there shall be no award of future medical expenses when

5

the statute of limitations is not complied with, and it

6

left that out of the attorneys' fees.

7

That's not how the statute is structured.

8

So we're in a situation where I think we ordinarily are

9

with statutes of limitation, in trying to decide what

10

the consequences of noncompliance are --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, one of -- one of

12

your -- your argument you were making is that there --

13

since the attorneys' fees provision looks to the end of

14

the case, it should not be construed to apply to the --

15

the failure to meet the filing deadline.

16

Is -- is that true?

I mean, the statute

17

says if the judgment does not award compensation, on a

18

petition filed under Section 300aa-11 -- if the judgment

19

does -- is there no judgment when a -- when a case is

20

dismissed for failure to meet the statute requirement?

21

MR. HORWICH:

It -- it seems to us that the

22

appropriate disposition of a case that is held to be

23

untimely is that there is a judgment denying

24

compensation.

25

something that's not really briefed, but the operation

And the reasons for that have to do with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 13

1

of the appellate provisions of the Act --

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

MR. HORWICH:

4

Wait, so --

-- become confusing if you

treat a dismissal as something different.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Other than the judgment.

6

Okay.

7

fee provision looks to the end of the case simply

8

doesn't fly.

9

indeed dismissal for failure to comply with the time

10

So then -- then your argument that -- that this

It looks to the beginning as well, if

limit is a judgment.

11

MR. HORWICH:

Well, we think -- we agree

12

that it's a judgment, but it -- but it has to be a

13

judgment, I'm looking here at page 26A of the appendix

14

to the government's brief, refers to the judgment of the

15

Court of Federal Claims on such a petition.

16

such a petition refers back to a petition filed --

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. HORWICH:

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

23

Well --

-- and so that's -Okay.

That's just

repeating your -- your first argument.

21
22

And then

MR. HORWICH:

Well -- I -- but I do think

that -JUSTICE SCALIA:

That petition means --

24

means a petition properly filed, but I don't see that

25

the -- that the statutory scheme, the provision that's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 14

1

at issue here, the provision for the award of attorneys'

2

fees looks to the end of the case and not to the

3

beginning.

4

judgment that dismisses because of a failure to comply

5

with the statute, it's still a judgment.

6

It looks to the judgment.

MR. HORWICH:

And if it's a

It's still a judgment, but it

7

is -- it is not a judgment in connection with a petition

8

that should be regarded as having been filed timely --

9
10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's your first argument.

I understand.

11

MR. HORWICH:

-- that is our first argument.

12

But let me say, it is also -- the -- the situation here

13

is not one in which we think that it's incumbent on the

14

government to -- to demonstrate clearly how Congress

15

wanted to withhold attorneys' fees.

16

construction here all caution the Court to be -- to be

17

extremely reluctant to extend or -- or find that

18

Congress is willing to pays attorneys' fees in -- in

19

this context.

20

reasons.

21

The canons of

And that's for -- and that's for several

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, wait.

Congress has

22

waived sovereign immunity.

23

there's a waiver of sovereign immunity here.

24
25

MR. HORWICH:

It's absolutely clear that

It's clear that there's a

waiver, but it's --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 15

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And once we find that, I

2

don't think we nitpick the following language to

3

unrealistically narrow it as much as possible.

4

the initial question of whether Congress has agreed to

5

be sued is, yes, we -- we assume it hasn't and -- and --

6

but -- but once it's clear that it has agreed to be

7

sued, I think we just interpret the language reasonable.

8
9

MR. HORWICH:

I mean,

Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- I

think this Court's decision certainly most recently in

10

the Cooper case, from a term or two ago, says that --

11

that this Court considers not only the existence but the

12

extent of the waiver of sovereign immunity to be

13

controlled by -- by canons that -- that counsel against

14

extending that -- extending that waiver.

15

But that's not the only issue here.

Because

16

the consequences of -- of Respondent's rule are ones

17

that -- that are entirely out of place both with fee

18

proceedings in general and with this compensation

19

program in particular.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Horwich, before you go

21

to the consequences argument, just to keep on with the

22

text a little bit, is this understanding that you have

23

of what it means to be filed, does it have any

24

consequences other than with respect to attorneys' fees,

25

or is that the only thing that -- that depends on

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16

1

viewing the word "filed" in this way?

2

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think viewing the word

3

"filed" in this way also explains mechanically why the

4

limitations issue becomes an affirmative defense on the

5

merits as well because Section 13 says compensation has

6

to be awarded on a record, and the record is defined as

7

the record on a petition filed.

8

get to the end of the case or you get to the point of

9

limitations determination, the court says, well, there

So similarly, if you

10

shouldn't -- there shouldn't be -- there should not have

11

been a petition here, and so regarding -- regarding is

12

done what should have been done, we'll say there is

13

no -- there is no record available on that petition, so

14

we should deny compensation.

15

So I agree it's a little -- which I concede

16

is -- is not how we ordinarily think about statutes of

17

limitation, but it -- but it certainly is that -- it is

18

exactly the same textual logic in the --

19
20
21
22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I totally lost that

answer.
MR. HORWICH:

Sure.

I'm happy to step

through it in the statute itself.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you -- could you

24

go back and talk to me again about what you mean about

25

not having a record?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 17

1

MR. HORWICH:

Sure.

So Section 13 of the

2

Act, which starts on page 19A of the government's brief

3

says that compensation is awarded "if the Special Master

4

report finds on the record" various matters.

5

But then it goes on, and this is on page 21A

6

in Section 13(c), to define the record as the -- as the

7

record established on a petition filed.

8

same sense that if the Special Master determines that

9

the limitations provision says, well, there shouldn't

And so in the

10

have been a petition filed, the consequence is there is

11

not a basis for attorneys' fees.

12

this definitional provision not a basis for the record

13

on which compensation is to be awarded on the merits.

14

And that produces the result that we would expect, which

15

is that --

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They're similarly in

I'm totally confused.

17

Are you suggesting that the record shouldn't be filed in

18

that case or that the record supports the conclusion

19

that it was untimely?

20

Or neither?

MR. HORWICH:

What I'm -- what I'm

21

suggesting is -- what I'm suggesting is that when the

22

limitation -- when it's determined that the limitations

23

provision applies and should have prevented the filing

24

of the petition, and the Special Master has to decide,

25

well, what are the consequences of that.

Alderson Reporting Company

Because,

Official
Page 18

1

again, the Special Master can't go back and actually

2

prevent the whole thing from having happened, but the

3

Special Master can say, well, if this direct -- if this

4

directed that there shouldn't have been a petition

5

filed, then one of the consequences is there's no --

6

there's no record on which we should be able to decide

7

compensation.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, as to the

consequences, let me give you these two cases.

The

10

first is the case in which the petition is timely filed

11

and -- as you see it, but the claimant does not prevail

12

because the claimant is unable to prove that the injury

13

was caused by the vaccine, but there was a reasonable

14

basis for the argument and the argument was made in good

15

faith, so there would be eligibility for attorneys'

16

fees.

17

The second is a case in which there is a

18

question about when the statute of limitations begins to

19

run.

20

is when there is the onset of significant aggravation of

21

an injury, which seems like a question about which there

22

could be a factual dispute.

23

well, the claimant does not prevail on the statute of

24

limitations argument, but there was a reasonable basis

25

for thinking that the petition was submitted within the

And one of the points at which it can begin to run

And in that situation as

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 19

1

period after the -- the onset of this significant

2

aggravation.
Why would Congress want to draw a line

3
4

between -- a distinction between those two situations

5

for the purpose of attorneys' fees?

6

MR. HORWICH:

Well, there's several reasons.

7

The first -- the first one is that in your -- in your

8

first example where there's been a determination on the

9

merits, the Special Master is in a perfect situation to

10

decide whether there was a reasonable basis on the

11

merits.

12

worked since its existence because to be clear, until

13

the decision below, there was no practice of awarding

14

attorneys' fees on untimely petitions in the -- in the

15

program.

16

And this is how -- this is how the program has

And so what you would get would be

17

situations like your first example, Justice Alito, where

18

the Special Master would issue a -- a written decision

19

on entitlement and these are -- these are 10, 15, 20,

25 pages long in my experience, dealing in considerable

21

detail with the medical evidence, the scientific

22

evidence, the expert testimony, the review of

23

literature, the different theories of causation, and

24

getting to the end, and obviously, if the decision is that

25

compensation is to be awarded, then attorneys' fees

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 20

1

follow as a matter of right, but if compensation is

2

denied, the Special Master can and typically does add,

3

literally as an afterthought, that -- but having been

4

through all of this and having discussed all of this, I

5

think there was a reasonable basis for what was being

6

argued here.

7

Now, in your second example where the

8

Special Master has only determined this essentially

9

diagnostic question of when was the first symptom of

10

this particular claimant's particular injury, the

11

Special Master hasn't looked at any materials about

12

whether the vaccine can cause that injury.

13

give as a -- as a paradigm example maybe the -- what we

14

give in our brief as the -- the Smith case, which had to

15

do with the claim of whether certain childhood vaccines

16

caused the claimant's Type 1 diabetes.

17

So let me

And the Special Master's decision focuses on

18

the question of whether the first symptom of the

19

diabetes was a blood glucose reading that sent the

20

claimant to the hospital, and then --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Excuse me.

Could you --

22

could you -- there seems to be a confusion in this

23

consequence conversation.

24

the attorneys' fee award on good faith basis has to do

25

with the ultimate merits, did the vaccine cause this

You seem to be assuming that

Alderson Reporting Company

injury?

I would have assumed that the award of

2

attorneys' fees has to do with whether the petition was

3

brought in good faith; i.e., was there a reasonable

4

basis to believe that the petition was timely?

5

that issue, before the Court can adjudicate the

6

timeliness question, it has to know all of the facts

7

that made the Petitioner believe it was timely.

8
9

And on

And so I'm a little bit confused as to what
additional factfinding the Court has to do.

It has to

be told by a lawyer, your cases say because reasonable

12

symptom.

13

the latter was the starting point of the statute, not

14

the former.

15

know to adjudicate whether that's in good faith, that

16

belief is in good faith?

17

MR. HORWICH:

The law says first

She experienced X, Y, and Z, and we thought

What more does the Special Master need to

Well, the question under the

18

attorneys' fee provision, and this is on 26(a) of the

19

government's brief, is a determination that the petition

20

was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable

21

basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.

22

The question isn't was there a reasonable basis to

23

believe it was timely, the question is -- and -- and I

24

think my friend agrees with me on this --

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, I understand.

Alderson Reporting Company

Page 22

JUSTICE BREYER:

But now, look, still, the

2

worst thing, the obvious question -- I mean, as a

3

textual matter, but I don't know how you reconcile your

4

position with the -- with the first words in 3300aa-11,

5

which is talking about a petition starts this whole

6

proceeding and you want to interpret that word

7

"petition" meaning a timely petition.

8

untimely petition doesn't start the proceeding?

9

that's the technical linguistic thing, but if you get to

10

your -- to your basic worrying you, what is worrying you

11

is this proceeding, okay?

12

think, the shadow trial.

13

MR. HORWICH:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

You mean an
I mean,

That's what's worrying you, I

Yes, it is.
Now, on that, just what

15

Justice Sotomayor said, you only get into this problem

16

when the attorney has filed this timeliness matter with

17

a good reason to think his petition is timely, otherwise

18

forget it.

19

Okay?
So you look at the complaint.

You see a

20

complaint there.

He had a good reason for thinking it's

21

timely.

22

his client has a good claim, a plausible one.

23

the government wants to say, we want to present some

24

evidence, let them do it.

25

that happens is this person who thought she had a good

Why is that -- why is that so terrible?

4

is that putting such a burden on the government that

5

they have to go through hoops, I think, to try to get

6

these words in the statute, too?

7

MR. HORWICH:

Why

What -- what we're worried

8

about here is -- is not the fact that some fees may be

9

paid.

What -- what we're worried about here, as you

10

said, are the shadow trials, and -- and to an extent

11

also the question of whether additional cases would be

12

attractive to the program.

13
14

JUSTICE BREYER:
the shadow trials.

15

MR. HORWICH:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's in your control,

Well -You don't have to have a

shadow trial if you don't want one.

18

MR. HORWICH:

Well, but -- but -- but, Your

19

Honor, I think where we're coming -- where we're coming

20

at this from is -- is saying what did Congress envision

21

here.

22

Congress doesn't want attorneys' fees to be a second

23

major litigation.

24

it would have set up a scheme in which the case would

25

end on the merits and yet, the question on which

And as this Court said in Hensley and in Pierce,

So it seems exceedingly odd to think

some further proceedings that have not --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why not -The shadow trial brings up

6

the answer that you were giving to the second part of

7

Justice Alito's question, which you never got to finish.

8

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you were saying -- you

10

were giving the example, suppose this were a question of

11

timeliness.

12

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And when did the fact of

14

the vaccine first -- or the symptoms first become

15

manifest, and you were -- and you said that this should

16

not be tried because -- and this is finishing off

17

Justice --

18

MR. HORWICH:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

Right.
-- Justice Alito's

dichotomy.

21

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

Maybe if I finish giving

22

the example I was giving in response to the -- the

23

second part of Justice Alito's dichotomy in that Smith

24

case.

25

resolved was, okay, was it the blood glucose reading

So the timeliness question the Special Master

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 25

1

that was within the limitations period that was the

2

first symptom or was it the excessive thirst and

3

frequent urination that fell outside the limitations

4

period.

5

Now, the Special Master, having resolved

6

that, which is something that I think perhaps even some

7

of us in the room could recognize that one of those was

8

the symptom -- was likely the first symptom or not, the

9

Special Master then has to decide, was there a

10

reasonable basis for the claim that childhood vaccines

11

cause Type 1 diabetes?

12

that that timeliness determination is going to be any

13

good for the Special Master in deciding.

14

And that's simply not something

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's a lot of

15

information just in 11 -- what is it -- (c), tells what

16

has to be put in the petition.

17

couldn't -- couldn't a Special Master make the

18

determination based on that?

19

MR. HORWICH:

And there's --

Well, I think part of the

20

problem is that we would be asking the Special Master to

21

spend the Special Master's time reviewing that material,

22

assuming that it's even in the petition, which is not

23

always the case.

24

spend -- spend her time evaluating that material in a

25

proceeding that can't result in compensation to any

We'd be asking the Special Master to

program, instead of spending her time on -- on other

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT T. FISHMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FISHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
My friend started with Section 16.

I'd like

14

to start very briefly with our reading of the fee

15

provision itself.

16

petition filed under Section 11 is eligible for award of

17

attorneys' fees, even if it's denied, provided that two

18

conditions are satisfied.

19

faith and with a reasonable basis."

20

Section 15(e)(1), which says, "Any

It has to be filed in good

15(e) itself and by its terms says nothing

21

about compliance with the statute of limitations.

The

22

filing provisions of Section 11, which are Section

23

11(a)(1) similarly say nothing about compliance with the

24

statute of limitations.

25

most direct and sensible reading of 15(e)(1), is you can

Our position, therefore, is the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 27

1

get an award of fees on a petition that has been denied

2

regardless of the reason why, and there is no textual

3

basis for saying that that provision carves out an

4

exception for one class of denied cases, those denied on

5

limitations grounds.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if -- if you're

7

preparing one of these filings, and you're all set to

8

go, and on the day before your filing you say, oh, gosh,

9

it doesn't look like we're going to be on time.

You

10

should still go ahead and file because you might be able

11

to apply for attorneys' fees.

12

day that it's due and you find out the day after, oh, my

13

gosh, we weren't on time, then there's no question that

14

you could apply for attorneys' fees.

15

MR. FISHMAN:

While if you file it the

Right.

And if I understand

16

that comment correctly, I think that's right, and -- and

17

you see actually many Special Master decisions that

18

ultimately deny a petition for failure typically to

19

prove causation; and when they turn to the reasonable

20

basis standard, they will say literally, your contact --

21

your client contacted you two days before the statute of

22

limitations was going to run.

23

You ran to the courthouse and filed.

You

24

had a basis, we believe, for filing your claim.

25

investigation, examination of the medical -- medical

Alderson Reporting Company

Further

Official
Page 28

1

records made you question that judgment, and you

2

abandoned the case.

3

in -- in that scenario.

4

And -- and there can be fee awards

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My hypothetical was

5

not that you had two days and you made it in time, but

6

that before the -- the time -- after the time expired or

7

you were ready to file on time, but then you decided on

8

further research, oh, this isn't going to look like

9

we're going to comply.

We thought we had the time, but

10

we don't.

11

that you might be able to get the fees?

12

You should still go ahead and file, right, so

MR. FISHMAN:

I think that would depend --

13

if -- if you're late, you're late.

I think the -- the

14

judgment your hypothetical would call on the attorney to

15

make is, why did we miss it, and maybe does that provide

16

grounds for equitable tolling or do we have a reasonable

17

and good faith argument as to timeliness?

18

If the lawyer says, I blew it, whether by a

19

day or a month or a year, I think that attorney's going

20

to have a very difficult time showing a good faith

21

reasonable basis for filing a claim that I think in your

22

hypothetical would be by the attorney's own account,

23

clearly time barred without justification.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

So are you saying that

the good faith and the reasonableness go to two things:

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 29

1

One, the claim on the merits, and also the timeliness.

2

MR. FISHMAN:

That is what we're saying.

3

That's also what the Federal circuit said.

4

word "claim," as it's used in the statute, encompasses

5

the entire case.

MR. FISHMAN:

So how do you answer the

12

about -- about that subject.

13

point because it may have been lost a little bit in the

14

briefs, is the government does not cite a single case

15

where there has ever even been a hearing held on a fee

petition, ever.

And I think the starting

MR. FISHMAN:

They are accumulated -- the

system that's established is one of front-loading.

24

You -- 11(c) requires an enormous amount of medical

25

documentation that is to be filed with the petition when

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 30

1

it's filed.

2

submit an affidavit explaining what's missing and why.

3

If they are incomplete, you're required to

The very first thing substantively that

4

happens with these things, Vaccine Act Rule 4(a) says

5

within 30 days of filing a petition, the secretary must

6

review the medical records, and if she thinks they are

7

deficient, she has to immediately notify the Petitioner,

8

and that is the very first thing that is hashed out in

9

these cases, complete medical records.

10

Section -- Vaccine Act Rule 2(c)(2) says if

11

you're not going to rely solely on medical records in

12

support of your petition -- medical records will often

13

contain evidence of causation.

14

themselves don't and you're going to go outside the

15

records, Vaccine Act Rule 2(c) -- 2(b)(2) is the actual

16

rule, says you're going to rely on observations or

17

testimony of every witness -- any witness, you have to

18

submit a detailed affidavit of the proposed testimony

19

that supports every allegation in the petition.

20

If the records

So the answer is, a lot of it's there right

21

at the front end, which is not to say that as these

22

cases get litigated and the areas of contention get

23

refined.

24

but it is front loaded.

25

Additional information can also be submitted,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So is your bottom line

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 31

1

that the record is already there for the shadow

2

determination?

3

MR. FISHMAN:

Sure.

And that's the reason

4

why we point out in our brief, routinely these cases are

5

decided -- fee determinations are made based on the

6

written materials without a hearing, without any

7

additional evidence.

evidentiary hearing.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

And if there is a hearing,

12

would the claimant's attorney get -- potentially get

13

attorneys' fees for the representation at the hearing

14

about attorneys' fees?

15

MR. FISHMAN:

Yes, the law is pretty clear

16

that fees are available for time incurred on seeking

17

fees.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think it would be

19

within the discretion of the court or Special Master to

20

look at a case and say, for whatever strange reason,

21

this is a case where it's going to require some lengthy

22

mini-trial in order to figure out fees and that's a bad

23

use of everybody's time, so I'm not going to grant

24

attorneys' fees here?

25

is a "may" provision; would it be a sufficient reason

In other words -- you know, this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 32

1

that this is just going to take too long, it's too

2

involved, so I'm going to deny attorneys' fees in this

3

case?

4

MR. FISHMAN:

I think that might well be

5

within a Special Master's discretion, if it really is

6

going -- if a fee determination really will require the

7

sort of parade of horribles that the government sees.

8

It's not our case, but I think it could be possible and

9

-- and within their discretion in a subsequent case.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You say the Special

11

Master "may" award -- so it "may" award is

12

discretionary.

13

MR. FISHMAN:

Correct.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's a tough

15

position, isn't it?

16

and tough and complicated case, well, you get no fees;

17

but if you've got an easy one, well, then you get fees.

18

I mean, if you have got a difficult

MR. FISHMAN:

I don't know -- the -- no

19

court and the parties have not briefed or addressed in

20

this case the -- the extent to which the "may"

21

discretion can be exercised in a procedural way that

22

Justice Kagan's hypothetical proposes.

23

I can't stand here and give you a hard and fast rule

24

that says that will never be appropriate.

25

I'm just saying,

Maybe if that case comes before a court and

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 33

1

a Special Master has done that, the argument will be

2

it's an abuse of discretion.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you

4

were -- I thought you were giving us that argument when

5

you said under the fees all you need is reasonable and

6

good faith.

7

MR. FISHMAN:

Those are the requirements to

8

be eligible for an award of fees, the statutory

9

requirements for eligibility.

But just because you meet

10

good faith and reasonable basis does not necessarily

11

mean you get fees for the -- for the reasons just

12

discussed.

13

It is discretionary.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is one reason

14

that should affect the exercise of discretion is that

15

you didn't comply with the statute of limitations?

16

MR. FISHMAN:

I think it might be.

There --

17

the law is not -- this is not the issue in our case, so

18

it's -- it's -- it's difficult to know the precise

19

contours of the exercise of discretion in a case where

20

nobody's contended that the discretion couldn't properly

21

be exercised.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, let's take -- let's

23

take this case.

What would you put in to show that you

24

have been reasonable, in good faith and reasonable, one,

25

as to the claim; and two, as to the attorneys' fees?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 34

1

What -- what would the Special Master have to look at to

2

make those determinations in this case?

3

MR. FISHMAN:

I will take the second part

4

first, reasonableness of statute of limitations.

The

5

Federal Circuit has already ruled that we were

6

reasonable to bring this case in terms of timeliness

7

because of the case law as it existed at the time the

8

petition was filed, the fact that we actually prevailed

9

on the timeliness question before the three-judge panel.

10

So the Federal -- I think on that question the Federal

11

Circuit has resolved it.

12

But if you want to go beyond that, I think

13

you would look at our briefs and the laws that existed

14

and the analysis of the various courts that have looked

15

at this and said -- and say, that was a close call, you

16

actually prevailed for a couple years on this question.

17

That's reasonable, and that's good faith.

18

As to the merits, it is all the material

19

that accompanied our petition, which is principally

20

medical records, also some medical studies linking the

21

Hepatitis B vaccine to MS, and then a number of

22

affidavits that were filed subsequently.

23

that is all you would need to look at, and -- that is

24

the only thing in the record.

25

has introduced no evidence in this case at any stage

And I think

Because the government

Alderson Reporting Company

contesting the merits of our underlying claim.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They are arguing that

3

they don't need to, and why should be -- why should they

4

be put to the burden of doing that?

5

MR. FISHMAN:

The reason is you have to

6

remember this is not ordinary civil litigation; it's a

7

streamlined front-loaded process.

8

Vaccine Act works is you file a petition with medical

9

records, as I mentioned before.

So the way the

You have 30 days for

10

the government to object to the completeness of the

11

record.

12

rules, and it's Rule 4(c), is the Secretary has 90 days

13

to set out all of her objections to the case.

14

The very next thing that happens under the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the very fact that

15

it's streamlined indicates to me that we should be very

16

careful to enforce the policy of the rule which is to

17

deter the filing of stale claims.

18

certainly undermines that.

19

MR. FISHMAN:

And your -- your rule

I think that you have to back

20

up and -- and acknowledge, as a starting point, that

21

there's no question that Congress intended this program

22

to award fees on petitions that have been denied.

23

as we point out in our brief, petitions are routinely

24

denied on procedural grounds where there has been no

25

examination of the underlying merits, just as the

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official
Page 36

1

government contends is the case with statute of

2

limitations.

3

We disagree with that.

We think actually to

4

resolve a statute of limitations question, a Special

5

Master is going to have a more complete understanding of

6

the underlying merits of a case than in many other

7

procedural settings.

8

already said, sure, it's a streamlined process, but

9

we're not going to pursue that objective at the expense

So we know that Congress has

10

of compensating attorneys who bring good faith claims,

11

but lose.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is the -- what's the

13

relationship between your position and equitable

14

tolling?

15

there was a fair amount of confusion about when the

16

statute of limitations might run or that's your

17

position.

18

attorney doesn't meet the limitations deadline will

19

involve things like -- you know, I was delayed by

20

Hurricane Sandy or -- or whatever, or we tried to file,

21

and it got lost in the mail.

I mean, your case, I think, is unusual in that

I would think a lot of the cases where the

22

Are those things that -- I mean, should that

23

be considered under the rubric of equitable tolling, or

24

under -- under your idea that you don't have to file on

25

time anyway?

Alderson Reporting Company

The -- the -- I think that the

2

best answer to that question is to look at the Federal

3

Circuit -- Circuit's en banc ruling in Cloer I.

4

actually argued -- we didn't argue snowstorm.

5

argument was is there was an extraordinary circumstance

that prevented us from filing within 36 months of the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand that,

10

but I would assume the more typical case is when you

11

miss a filing deadline is because the lawyer, whether

12

for good reasons or bad, missed the filing deadline.

13

And I'm just curious if you would -- if it's not

14

sufficient to support equitable tolling, whether it is,

15

therefore, unreasonable when it comes to attorneys'

16

fees?

17

MR. FISHMAN:

I think that would be a

18

case-by-case determination as to whether the particular

19

facts relied upon supported good faith and a reasonable

20

basis.

21

be -- a lawyer would be skating on thin ice there, too,

22

because the Federal Circuit made clear in Cloer I that

23

fraud and duress are the grounds for equitable tolling.

24

So I think if you are going to bring a claim that you

25

know is late and your only excuse is a snowstorm, you

I think in Your Honor's hypothetical, you would

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 38

1

have to look at Cloer I and think, I don't have a very

2

strong or maybe any equitable tolling argument.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It does seem to me, I did

4

not have the opportunity to ask the government this

5

question, that the equitable tolling argument undercuts

6

the government's position that no petition may be filed,

7

as being an absolute.

8

the government concedes, that there is equitable

9

tolling.

10
11
12
13
14

Because we all know, I take it

MR. FISHMAN:

They -- well, they fought the

issue.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or there can be equitable

tolling in some cases.
MR. FISHMAN:

Sure.

That's the law.

They

15

fought the issue below and lost, and in fairness, in

16

their briefs to this Court, they say, we don't agree

17

with the ruling just because we didn't seek this Court's

18

review for reasons that are not identified.

19

That is the law.

That's correct.

And it

20

is, frankly, one in a long list of inconsistencies with

21

their conception of what it means to file under the Act.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fishman, this may be a

23

hard question for you to answer, but is your sense of

24

why it is that petitions are untimely filed that they

25

usually have to do with things like -- you know,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 39

1

snowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have

2

to do with questions about the manifestation of

3

symptoms?

4

Or something else, if something else is --

5

just the range of cases out there, what are we talking

6

about?

7

Why are these cases untimely filed?
MR. FISHMAN:

My understanding from reading

8

the case law is it's the latter.

9

It is here is a disease.

It's not snowstorms.

I have a child that has been

10

sick her whole life.

11

disease?

12

other symptom 42, and the experts often battle that out,

13

and -- and oftentimes the Special Master say, sorry, it

14

was the cough at 40 months that is the first symptom of

15

the disease, not the symptom you've pointed to.

16

When is the first symptom of this

She coughed 40 months ago.

JUSTICE ALITO:

She had a -- some

This may be a question that

17

the government is in a better position to answer, but

18

do -- do you have any sense of how often claims are

19

rejected on the ground of timeliness, what we're dealing

20

with?

21

I mean, you mentioned in a footnote that the

22

fund out of which the -- the claims and the attorneys'

23

fees are paid has a positive balance of $3.5 billion.

24

Maybe the only government fund that has a positive

25

balance, but --

Alderson Reporting Company

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

3

Is this going to bankrupt

the -- the system?

4

MR. FISHMAN:

I -- I can't imagine how it

5

would even really put much of a dent in that government

6

obligation.

7
8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you know how many cases

we might be dealing with?

9

MR. FISHMAN:

I -- I don't.

I know that

10

there are not a huge number of published cases by

11

Special -- unpublished decisions by Special Masters on

12

the statute of limitations question.

13

that those numbers will actually go down moving forward,

14

even under the rule we're proposing because of the law

15

on when the statute of limitations runs is so much

16

clearer now than it was in 2005 when we brought this

17

case.

I tend to think

18

The other point, of course, is you're always

19

going to have to show good faith and a reasonable basis.

20

So the government seems to suggest that the rule we're

21

advocating and the one that the Federal Circuit adopted

22

is going to result in a flood of frivolous litigation.

23

I think that's just not supported because of the

24

requirements you'd have to establish.

25

I think there's also no reason to think that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 41

1

that will be the case empirically, and I say that for

2

this reason:

3

authorized the payment of fees to losers.

4

out $2.4 billion in compensation to individuals injured

5

by vaccines in that 25 years and just about $160 million

6

in fees for winners and losers.

7

6 percent.

8

system of paying losers really encouraged the filing of

9

frivolous lawsuits so lawyers could be paid, you'd think

10

the number would be substantially higher than 6 percent.

11
12

The -- the program for 25 years has

It is just over

And one would think that if this unusual

JUSTICE ALITO:
Masters?

It has paid

Who pays for the Special

Is that paid out of the fund?

13

MR. FISHMAN:

It is.

14

I do want to answer a couple of the

15

questions that were presented during my friend's

16

presentation.

17

the Secretary no longer discharges her obligation to

18

publish in the Federal Register, but as we noted in our

19

brief, our petition was published.

20

to publish it was triggered by the statute's requirement

21

that a petition has, quote, "been filed under Section

22

11."

23

The -- I was not aware of the fact that

And her obligation

Ours -- ours, in fact, was published.
The question that -- that you raised,

24

Justice Kagan, is there any other situation where this

25

reading results in a petition that has been filed.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official
Page 42

1

answer is yes, the government argues that a petition

2

filed under Section 11, even if it's untimely, is

3

sufficient to commence proceedings and confer

4

jurisdiction, which if that's true, it goes to your

5

question, Justice Sotomayor.

6

statute -- if the statute of limitations is not

7

jurisdictional?

8

next?

9

How do you get here if the

How do you get from one place to the

I -- I think there's not a good answer for that.
Another question that has arisen, I think,

10

Justice Scalia, your comments are correct, that -- that

11

a filing, a judgment can occur at any time in a case.

12

think it's also important to remember that the Secretary

13

is not bound to defend a case on the merits and then

14

contest a fee award for the same reason.

15

cases pending before the Special Masters right now that

16

for reasons I suspect are that the Secretary wanted to

17

establish a precedent, that there is no causation

18

between vaccine A and injury X, we want to litigate that

19

on the merits, and they have won.

20

dunk.

21

to contradict that, which was rejected.

22

I

So there are

But it wasn't a slam

There was a lot of evidence and a lot of science

Those lawyers now come before the Special

23

Master and seek fees in those cases, and the Secretary

24

is arguing no fees because these are time-barred.

25

in that case, you are going to have a judgment, by the

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official
Page 43

1

government's account, entered on the merits and then

2

they're going to come back and defend a fee award

3

saying, there is no judgment because there's never been

4

a case filed, and you can't get fees.

5

fundamental and glaring inconsistency with their

6

position.

7

And it is just a

I want to address a couple additional points

8

on the shadow trial argument because these were raised

9

in the government's reply brief.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could I -- I have been

11

thinking about your last point.

12

point easily be remedied by -- by simply our holding

13

that -- you know, you -- you can't ride both horses;

14

that if, in fact, you've litigated it through to a -- to

15

a merits judgment in your favor, which presumably has

16

stare decisis effect, you then cannot come back and say

17

the suit never occurred because the filing was too late.

18

I mean, we -- I think we're able to hold that, don't you

19

think?

20

MR. FISHMAN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Couldn't that last

I -I mean, I agree with you

22

it's a terrible -- it's a terrible, outrageous thing for

23

the government to do, to win the case and get -- get

24

stare decisis effect, and then to say you can't get

25

lawyers' fees because there's never been a case, right?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 44

1

MR. FISHMAN:

Right.

I mean, I think

2

that -- yes, and I think that, in terms of authority,

3

power, I think that --

4
5

JUSTICE SCALIA:
couldn't we?

6
7

We could make that up,

MR. FISHMAN:

I think that you probably

could.

8

(Laughter.)

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

MR. FISHMAN:

Sure.

I think you probably could,

11

but I think that the problem is you would then be, in

12

essence, adopting a procedural rule though that endorses

13

the inconsistency in the position.

14

for some purposes but not for others, even though

15

Congress only referred to petitions filed in -- in the

16

generic sense.

17

at which it's entered or the basis on which it's

18

entered.

19

A petition is filed

It didn't distinguish between the time

And it could have easily done these things.
The -- the government is proposing this

20

legal fiction.

Well, they say, sure, I mean, it can be

21

tendered and accepted and you can litigate it for years

22

and there can be all sorts of rulings, but as soon as

23

the Special Master enters a ruling on timeliness, the

24

phrase is they're bound to, quote, "refuse to recognize"

25

that it has ever been filed.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 45

1

They could have established that -- Congress

2

could have established that legal fiction.

3

have said no petition shall be deemed to be filed if it

4

is brought after the statute of limitations has run.

5

It could

Or Congress could have achieved this same

6

consequence that the government is attributing to

7

Section 16 by enacting a rule like this Court's Rule

8

13-2; the court will not -- will not file a cert

9

petition that is untimely.

10
11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You were going to address

the shadow trial?

12

MR. FISHMAN:

Yeah, a couple -- a couple

13

quick points.

We cited 11 cases in the discussion of

14

our -- in our discussion of shadow trials for the point

15

that these petition -- petitions are denied on

16

procedural grounds all the time, and Special Masters

17

resolve subsequent fee requests routinely and without a

18

hearing.

19

The government --

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Procedural grounds because

the affidavits aren't sufficient or --

22

MR. FISHMAN:

Inadequate records is one

23

reason.

Sometimes, a petitioner dies, and their family

24

or estate does not want to pursue this, so it's

25

abandoned.

There's cases where there's just a failure

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 46

1

to prosecute, it's not clear why; the lawyers lost touch

2

with a client or I don't know the reason why, it's just

3

a failure to prosecute.

4

There are also cases where somebody is

5

arguing for causation, but as their case is going

6

through the system, other cases are being decided that

7

reject their view, particularly paradigm cases.

8

petitioners fold, they give up, but the lawyers, having

9

fought the cases for years, come in and argue.

And the

So those

10

are all, incidentally, examples of procedural denials

11

that are reflected in the 11 cases we cited.

12

The point I wanted to make is the government

13

doesn't say which of those cases it's referring to when

14

it makes the claim that our cases reflect circumstances

15

where the Secretary has determined the program's

16

resources would be best conserved by, I think the phrase

17

is "acquiescing" to a modest request for fees.

18

They don't identify what cases they're

19

talking about, but in 10 of the 11 cases we cited, on

20

their face, fee awards were contested.

21

litigated.

22

Masters are resolving the challenges that the Secretary

23

made, and they are doing it without a hearing.

24
25

And they're

And you read the opinions, and the Special

There also is this argument about -- I think
we've already gone over the fact that a statute of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 47

1

limitations determination is not identical to a

2

causation determination.

3

the Secretary made in their brief is that, unlike many

4

other matters that must be supported at the outset --

5

the key question in most of these cases, causation, you

6

don't have to furnish evidence or make allegations of

7

causation -- is not correct.

8
9

The additional argument that

Under Section 11(c), if you're bringing a
non-table case, you have to allege cause and fact.

10

And if the medical records don't support causation, you

11

need an affidavit from an expert.

12

front-loaded as well.

13
14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there regulations or

rules establishing hourly rates?

15

MR. FISHMAN:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

So that is

There are not.
Do you have any idea

from the cases what the ranges are?

18

MR. FISHMAN:

For rates?

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. FISHMAN:

For rates.

It varies region by region.

21

think the Special Masters look to see what the rates in

22

Denver are as opposed to the rates in New York or Los

23

Angeles --

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I

I know that civil rights

rates, for example, are far below market rates for most

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

law firms.

2

rates generally?

3

Is that the same for this, or is it market

4

MR. FISHMAN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Market rates for general

litigation.

7
8

I think it's less.

13

sometimes because the Special Masters don't pay what

14

experts in these cases want.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21
22
23

Thank you, counsel.

MR. HORWICH:

Thank you.

I think it's

important -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you have some

24

evidence -- numbers -- to tell us how complicated the

25

fee award disputes are generally -- putting aside

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 49

1

because it hasn't until recently been an issue for cases

2

dismissed -- but for other cases, particularly those

3

dismissed on -- other procedural grounds.

4

MR. HORWICH:

Well, no, we don't.

And

5

actually, that's the point I wanted to start with

6

is that -- is that the Federal Circuit's decision below

7

puts the program into this unchartered territory, where

8

we don't really know what this is going to look like.

9

The cases that -- that my friend cites in

10

his brief are ones that either the petition is so

11

facially defective that, of course, fees can't be

12

awarded on it, but there's no reason to think that's

13

going to be the typical case.

14

And then there's other cases where the

15

application of the reasonable basis standard is so lax

16

as to essentially just turn on -- on the claimant's

17

personal say-so, that, oh, I think the vaccine caused my

18

injury.

19

example; it's cited in there.

20
21
22

That's like -- that's the Hamrick case, for

And that -- that can't be the standard for
reasonable basis.
And -- and so I think the Court needs to

23

keep in mind that, for example, when my friend says

24

there's -- the government doesn't cite a case where

25

there's been any shadow trial, the reason is because

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 50

1

there haven't been fees available on untimely petitions,

2

which is exactly the set-up that would cause you to have

3

a shadow trial.

4
5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But there have been

dismissals on other procedural grounds.

6

MR. HORWICH:

Well, there aren't -- there

7

are not really other procedural grounds.

8

situations where a petition is voluntarily withdrawn,

9

and I think there is a problem there about there not

10

actually being a judgment when somebody voluntarily

11

withdraws.

12

There may be

But even in those, the Special Masters

13

should have, in our view, examined whether there was a

14

reasonable basis.

15

an attorney can come in, file the petition and then the

16

claimant decides, well, I would like to withdraw, and

17

then the attorney essentially gets paid as of right.

18

I don't think it's right to say that

So our -- it's unsurprising that there's no

19

examples of these hearings.

20

my friend says, well, there -- for the petitions, when

21

it comes time to determine fees, the record is complete.

22

Of course the record is complete because the case has

23

been decided on the merits.

24

situation under which the program has been operated.

25

It's also unsurprising that

And that's the paradigm

What we are talking about here is entering

Alderson Reporting Company

2

has not been before, and where you wouldn't think

Congress would want to send it.

4

concern with this case.

5

here -- and the reason we've petitioned for certiorari

6

is not because of the dollar amount involved in paying

7

these claims.

8

resources are being directed.

9

And this is our central

The government's concern

The concern is about where the program's

The question is -- the question is about

10

where the finite number of Special Masters, the finite

11

number of government attorneys, can put their time in

12

responding to these petitions for -- to deliver the

13

compensation to the very few, but very deserving people

14

who Congress wanted to award compensation to.

15

And our concern here is --

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So your view here it's the

17

same.

18

decide to withdraw the petition when it's dismissed

19

early on for a procedural ground, when the record is

20

inadequate, et cetera.

21
22

No attorneys' fees when the client dies, or they

You think that in none of those cases
Congress would have wanted attorneys' fees.

23

Or is it --

24

MR. HORWICH:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, in the case of --- do you think in some but

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 52

1

not others?

2

MR. HORWICH:

Well, no.

In the case where

3

the claimant dies, the statute has provisions for that,

4

and you can obtain compensation in that situation.

5

there's no reason an attorney can't go on there --

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So

No, no, no, no, the family

gives up.
MR. HORWICH:

-- if they want to -- if they

want to withdraw the petition, I guess it depends on

10

exactly the circumstances under which --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but my question is what

12

is your view?

13

heard, he listed six or seven different instances --

14

four or five anyway; he's found 11 cases, apparently.

15

And so what is your view?

16

It's the same problem.

MR. HORWICH:

He's listed, you

Well, my view -- my view is

17

the view that I think we would take under any other fee

18

shifting provision, which is that if a claimant wants to

19

withdraw his or her case, I don't think that he can then

20

claim the benefit of the attorneys' fee provision,

21

absent some circumstances that -- that would warrant the

22

finding of reasonable basis.

23

unexceptional result.
