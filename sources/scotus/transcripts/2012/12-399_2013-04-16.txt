ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MS. BLATT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
All parties agree that even if the birth

12

father is a parent under the Indian Child Welfare Act,

13

the State court decision below awarding custody to the

14

father must nonetheless be reversed unless Sections

15

1912(d) or (f) create custodial rights that the father

16

concededly does not have under State law.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you suggesting -- I

18

don't know that the parties -- I know that the

19

government has said that (f) doesn't apply to the

20

father, but (d) does, so there's not a full concession

21

on your point.

22

father who has visitation rights, and exercising all of

23

his support obligations, is it your position that --

24

that because that father's not a custodian, he has no

25

protections whatsoever under (d) or (e)?

But putting that aside, if it is a

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

The State can come and take the child away

2

from an unfit mother or father if they're the ones with

3

custody, and that responsible parent who only has

4

visiting rights has no protections under (d), (e), or

5

(f)?

6

MS. BLATT:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8
9
10
11
12

Well, under State law -I'm not asking about

State law -MS. BLATT:

Right.

I think that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- I'm asking about
Federal law.
MS. BLATT:

Yes, Federal law, which

13

requires custodial rights, would protect a father who

14

has visitation, i.e., custodial rights under State law.

15
16
17

So in other words, that -- that is to say,
if a father -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

about custodial rights.

19

continued --

Well, (d) doesn't talk

I do agree that (f) talks about

20

MS. BLATT:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- custody.

22

MS. BLATT:

Right.

Okay.

So let's talk about (d)

23

because I think we are in agreement that the Respondents

24

would have to agree that they either need to win under

25

(d) or (f), and we can talk about Section 1915, but
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that's not a basis for father.

2

But section (d) -- and I'm reading from the

3

blue brief at 8a says that it requires the party seeking

4

the termination of parental rights to provide, quote,

5

"remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed

6

to prevent the breakup of the Indian family."

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you don't think

8

that a parent with custody -- well, you do think a

9

parent with custody is the only definition of family,

10

but why wouldn't a noncustodial parent with visitation

11

rights be considered a family with that child?

12
13

MS. BLATT:
law, a parent who --

14
15
16
17

My understanding under State

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not going to State

law -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could -- could I

hear her answer, please?

18

MS. BLATT:

19

So the answer is, a parent with visitation

20
21

Yes.

rights has custody, so he's protected.
Under State law, if you're paying child

22

support and you bring a paternity action and sue for

23

visitation rights, that's a petition for custody.

24

all a birth dad needs to do to protect himself is to

25

acquire legal rights.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

This father had no legal rights whatsoever,

2

parental or custodial, and the word "breakup," even the

3

other side concedes, it's discontinuance of an existing

4

legal relationship.

between this child and the birth father or his

6

relatives.

7

10

There was no legal relationship

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there is a support

MS. BLATT:

No.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't that a

11

parental right?

12

States enforce whether or not you want to provide

13

support or not.

14

It's one of the parental rights the

MS. BLATT:

If a child is being adopted, by

15

definition, the -- the adoptive family would be

Because there's -As --

Because there's nothing in this

12

custodial parent has something like a drug abuse problem

13

the State has to remediate before the family is broken

up.

At most, there is

15

What is so extraordinary about this case,

16

particularly the United States' position, is that the

17

adoptive parents' failure to remediate a dad meant that

18

the child got custody of the dad.

19

had a drug problem because there was no treatment of him

20

the court held, well, that's a basis for giving the dad

21

custody.

22

So if this dad had

even remotely suggests that it's a rights-creating

provision.

25

protections that assume existing rights and then make it

All of both of (d), (e), and (f) are

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your -- your argument

assumes that the phrase in the statute "to prevent the

4

breakup of the Indian family" only applies where --

5

where the father has custody.

6

why that should be true.

7

meant, they could have put it much more narrowly.

8

had a very broad phrase, "to prevent the break up of an

10

If -- if that's what Congress

Oh, I see.

MS. BLATT:

Well, I'm hanging -- I'm hanging

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

He's a biological father and nothing

point, if the choice is between a mother, a biological

25

1

given to a stranger rather than to the biological father

2

when the statute defines "parent" as the biological

3

father?

4

MS. BLATT:

And assuming all biological

5

fathers that are acknowledged or established are swept

6

in, which would include any biological father, the only

7

stranger in this case was the birth father, who

8

expressly repudiated all parental rights and had no

9

custodial rights.

10

So again, the problem the other side

has --

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he didn't.

I mean,

12

he -- he said that he was prepared to surrender rights

13

to the mother, but not to a stranger.

14

issue of adoption came up, he said, "Yes, I want to

15

assert my parental rights."

16

MS. BLATT:

And when the

It was too late.

There's not a

17

single State law that lets a dad, birth dad, hold that

18

kind of veto power over a woman.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where does it -- where is

20

there a reference in the definition of "parent" to a

21

State law?

22

defines a parent?

23
24
25

I see the -- which is the section that

MS. BLATT:

Section 1903(9).

assuming -- which is -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

But even

Official

1

MS. BLATT:

-- on page 4A.

Whether it's a

2

Federal definition or a State law definition, I think

3

everyone agrees you've got to at least look at some sort

4

of State law.

5

paternity, meaning a biological link is established,

6

they still have to have a basis for an extraordinary

7

award of a transfer of custody when there's been no best

8

interest determination and you have a dad who's a

9

complete stranger with no -- no parental rights

10

But even if it's just a bare fact of

whatsoever.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It says a parent means a

12

biological parent of an Indian child and he fits that

13

definition.

14

sentence doesn't have any reference to State law.

15

And then the next section -- the next

MS. BLATT:

That's right.

And again,

16

assuming he is a parent -- they -- they need to win both

17

points, Justice Ginsburg.

18

He needs to be a parent.

Now, if you're an ICWA parent, which means

19

if you want to accept this definition of "all

20

biological," you do have rights under the Federal Act of

21

getting notice and a right to counsel, and the tribe

22

would have a right to intervene.

23

there a basis for transferring custody under (d) or (f).

24

(F) is the one that requires continuing custody.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The question is, is

But, Ms. Blatt, if he's a

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

parent, why wouldn't some provision in 1912 give him

2

some rights?

3

him a parent under that definitional section if he

4

doesn't get any of the protections that 1912 provides

5

for when to terminate rights?

6

In other words, what's the point of making

MS. BLATT:

Because this -- this Act is not

7

about creating rights that didn't otherwise exist.

8

about protecting rights and making it harder to

9

terminate rights that already exist.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what's the point of

11

labeling a parent if he gets no parental rights

12

under the statute and if the termination provisions

13

don't apply to him?

14

MS. BLATT:

Notice, right to counsel, and

15

heightened consent requirements.

16

the birth mother is a parent, so she had a right to

17

notice, right to counsel, and heightened consent

18

requirements.

19
20

It's

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the mother here,

But what is he supposed

to --

21

MS. BLATT:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So those are very significant.
Well, how are they

23

significant?

24

because if you get notice, but then you have nothing to

25

say in the proceeding because the statute gives you no

I mean, I'm trying to understand this

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

rights and the statute doesn't provide any standards for

2

terminating those rights --

3

MS. BLATT:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

Right.
-- what are you supposed to

do once you get notice?

6

MS. BLATT:

Justice Kagan, just because he's

7

in the door as a parent, that doesn't mean the statute

8

let him leave out the back door with the child when

9

there was no, no determination with respect to -- I

10

mean, any kind -- it would be unprecedented to think

11

that because you had a failure to remediate to prevent

12

the breakup of an Indian family, that's a basis for

13

awarding custody?

14

which is --

15

And that's the United States' view,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think you're not answering

16

the question of what's the point of labeling him a

17

parent if he gets none of the protections that the Act

18

provides to a parent?

19

MS. BLATT:

You're assuming that this entire

20

Act was to make sure unwed dads who are Indian got more

21

time than non-Indian dads to veto adoptions, and that

22

had -- that's not even remotely the purpose of this.

23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, wait, wait, wait.

adoptive parents would have no legal basis for objecting

24

to an award to the father.

11

Justice Ginsburg, of a statute that would override a

12

birth mother's right to choose the adoptive parents for

13

14

Otherwise, you do have an extraordinary reading,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it your position

15

that the preference is absolute or is it simply a factor

16

to be considered with the other -- in other words, if

17

every other factor suggests that the best interests of

18

the child are served by placement with the adoptive

19

couple, does the preference under 1915(a) trump all

20

those other interests?

21

MS. BLATT:

It's not our view.

Our view is

22

you would have -- you absolutely would have had good

23

cause with -- here when you had the 27 months and also

24

the mother's choice.

25

The tribe's position is that --

again is extraordinary.

6

any other adopt -- any other Indian would get a

preference whether or not that Indian had the same

It's also extraordinary that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. BLATT:

So State law is you have to

support the mother during pregnancy or at birth.

21

cases are pretty clear that the father can't wait till

22

he learns of the adoption.

23
24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So the

So the State law

determines when his rights under the Federal Act end?
MS. BLATT:

No.

State law determines just

17
Alderson Reporting Company

1

when you have parental rights to begin with.

2

there's no question that this particular dad, had State

3

law applied, the adoption would have gone forward and

4

his rights would have been terminated by virtue of his

5

lack of a right to -- to object to the adoption.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So its

Unless we believe that the

7

Federal statute determines when he has parental rights

8

9

MS. BLATT:

10
11

Yes, but you still have --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that's the case, then

what you said doesn't apply.

-- custodial rights, though.

13

That's not a basis for granting him custodial rights.

14

This -- again, the -- we can talk about (f), but I think

(f) is pretty obvious that that assumes

preexisting custody to be continued.

3

4

about the breakup of a removal proceeding under (f) or a

5

foster care proceeding under (e), and the government

there are really two kinds of parents.

MS. BLATT:

Well, I think it's rather

10

completely upside down that this entire statute, with 20

11

or 24 references to removal, custody, return of child to

12

the parent, is somehow being read to create rights.

13

There is no language in this statute that creates

14

custodial rights, and the birth father in this case

15

because of an exhaustion failure under (d), walked off

16

with the child without any best interest determination.

The birth father would have

Now, the lower courts --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do you do with the

lower court's determination that one of the factors of

9

the best interest calculus was the Federal policy to

10

ensure that Indian children, children of biological

11

Indian parents, at least one, should be raised with

their parents?

13

it was in the best interest of this child to stay with

14

its birth father, in light of the Federal policy.

15

disagree with your colleague that there wasn't a best

16

interest --

17

Because the lower court said it thought

MR. CLEMENT:

So I

it were true that the Federal preference was one factor

whether this new custodial relationship, beyond a

9

Those findings were made in the context of

MR. CLEMENT:

What the court specifically

said is they looked at the expert testimony of how it

17

would cause trauma, despair, anxiety, depression on this

18

baby girl to be taken from her parents, and the court

19

specifically said all of that was legally irrelevant

20

because 1912(f) only lets you look at the harm from the

21

new custodial relationship.

22

any harm from the breakup of the previous custodial

23

relationship.

It doesn't let you look at

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, and even in that

3

sense, serious emotional and physical damage is a much

4

different threshold than the best interests of the

5

child, even on the statutory terms.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

It's miles away.

And it's the

7

appropriate standard when you're taking somebody who has

8

existing legal custody and depriving them of it.

9

everywhere in the law, including ICWA, when you make an

But

10

initial placement of a child in a new custodial setting,

11

you don't do that unless you look at the child's best

12

interest.

13

And look at 1916(a) of ICWA, which is the only

14

provision in the Act that specifically contemplates a

15

child being placed in a new custodial setting.

16

about what happens if you have an adoption and then the

17

adoptive parents for some reason terminate their rights

18

and then you send the child back to their original

Indian custodian.

20

that when there's been a break of custody, you don't

just send somebody off to a -- a new setting based on

interests of the child.

because otherwise, we're going to give custody by

7

estoppel.

In January, when he

We're going to encourage people to hold on

January, when he asserted his rights, that's what we're

looking at.

12

at the time the issue was raised, and that was 4 or 5

13

months after the birth of the child.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

What was in the best interests of the child

Well, Justice Sotomayor, I'm

15

here representing the guardian who represents the best

16

interest of the child.

17

the child really doesn't care whose fault it was when

18

they were brought in one custodial situation or another.

From the child's perspective,

They just want a determination that focuses

20

on at the relevant time, that time, what's in their best

23

there has to be a best interest determination that takes

24

into account the current situation, notwithstanding that

25

still think this girl --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we're going to freeze

4

it at that point or are we going to freeze it today,

5

after the child's been with his -- with her father for 2

years?

MR. CLEMENT:

somebody's talking about --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't want to be that

judge, by the way.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

You freeze it at the time that

12

somebody's talking about changing a custodial situation.

13

But what is so tragic here is that the lower court

14

applied 1912(d) and (f), which are clearly designed for

15

a situation when you're contemplating transferring

16

custody away from an existing custodial relationship.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I -- and I take it

8

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

And I would hope

with instructions to please make that determination as

10

quickly as humanly possible.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the best interest of

12

the child is the uniformly accepted standard in State

13

courts, and if we forget constitutional avoidance

14

problems which I -- I think exist here, is there

15

anything in the statute that allows us to import the

16

best interests of the child into the statutory language,

17

or do we have to just rely on constitutional avoidance

18

and -- and really rewrite the statute?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, a couple of things,

20

Justice Kennedy.

21

1915(a) and the placement preferences -- and we agree

22

with Petitioners that they're not squarely applicable

23

here because the birth father's argument was not that I

24

get to adopt, but that I have an entitlement -- if you

25

got to that, I think the good cause standard gives you a

If you got to the point of applying

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

vehicle for importing a lot of best interest standards.

2

I also think you could look --

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though -- even

4

though the guidelines to what's good cause do not

5

include best interest.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right, but even the

7

Justice Department doesn't say that the guidelines are

8

binding or entitled to anything more than Skidmore

9

deference, and I'd take constitutional avoidance over

10

Skidmore deference any day.

11

But the second thing I would put on the

12

table is I think the fact that 1916(a) tells you that

13

the one time you are thinking about transferring

14

custody, Congress looked to the best interest standard.

15

That's a clear hint that if you are talking about

16

transferring custody you should look to the best

17

interests.

18

And, again, I think it's imperative to look

19

at 1912(d), (e), and (f).

20

Solicitor General recognizes, they all contemplate

21

continued custody, (e) and (f) do.

22

As the government and the

Now, then the government turns around and

23

says, well, but (d) was a basis for what the lower court

reasonable doubt.

6

At least (f) has
It

It's the transfer

But (d) has no standard to satisfy.

And

7

their position is that because this birth father was not

8

presented with remedial and rehabilitative services,

9

therefore, because he didn't get remedial services that

10

presumably he needed, he gets the child.

11

That's crazy.

And what it shows is that 12(d) assumes that

it's like an exhaustion requirement, and unless and

23

happened because of 3/256ths of Cherokee blood.

It happened here because of ICWA, which by its

3

there were applications of the statute that raised equal

protection problems because they treated people

differently solely on the basis of race.

classification, thinks that somebody with 325 --

tribal -- a tribal member, eligible for tribal

14

membership.

15

And as a result of that, her whole world

changes and this whole inquiry changes.

a focus on the birth father and whether or not beyond a

parent in the statute, it only makes sense to prove

something more than bare paternity.

Or you could do it by recognizing that if
somebody gets in the front door of this statute based on

bare paternity, you have to interpret provisions like

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

closely at the situation here and they found, in their

words, that the father here was a "fit, devoted, and

loving father," and they said expressly and found

expressly as a factual matter that it was in the best

MR. ROTHFELD:

MR. ROTHFELD:

Correct, but with this

An Indian child is someone who is either a member of a

tribe or eligible, and is the biological child of a

member of an Indian tribe.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That is correct.
So return to what is

6

a hypothetical question and not what the statute

could be considered an Indian child.

Under your argument, a tribe that did not

Yes, yes, you have

13

somebody who has no Indian blood, he enrolls in my

14

15

would be an Indian child and the father would be

16

entitled to the protections you're arguing for.

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

That child

Well, that's -- that's true

in theory.

if that were to occur and whether or not that would be

sort of a legitimate basis for determining membership of

22

But of course, A, that is not our case.

JUSTICE BREYER:

B,

But that is a problem.

23

Because, look, I mean, as it appears in this case is he

24

had three Cherokee ancestors at the time of George

All right?

Now, you say, oh,

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

well, that's a different issue.

2

But I don't see how to decide that case

3

without thinking about this issue because if your view

4

is taken and you accept that definition, a - a woman who

5

is a rape victim who has never seen the father could,

6

would, in fact, be at risk under this statute that the

7

child would be taken and given to the father who has

8

never seen it and probably just got out of prison, all

9

right?

10
11

And you don't know that this beyond reasonable

doubt standard would satisfy that.
Now, that's obviously something I find

12

disturbing, as a person and also as a judge, because

13

we're trying to interpret the statute to avoid results

14

that would be very far out, at least.

15

what I want you to tell me.

of risk through an interpretation of the statute?

First, in this case, there has

that I think the vast majority of State courts have

correctly rejected that theory because --

It -- it would be sort of

Alderson Reporting Company

1

beyond the judicial competence to determine whether or

2

not a particular person is Indian enough to qualify for

3

treatment as a father of an Indian child under -- under

4

ICWA.

5

Just to nail this down, as to the particular

6

membership criteria of the Cherokee Nation, no one has

7

ever suggested, our opponents here do not suggest that

8

that is, in any sense, illegitimate or not a traditional

9

basis for establishing membership in an Indian tribe.

10

So if one can imagine wild hypotheticals of

the sort that Justice Alito and the Chief Justice have

suggested, they are not present here, and those would

13

present political questions to be addressed by Congress

14

unquestionably satisfies the definition of parent in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kneedler, let's say

22

you're right that this man is a parent under the terms

has a legal status as parent under this Act.

25

1912 says, well, this is how you go about terminating

parental rights, right?

But then your argument suggests that one of

3

these clauses applies to him and the other one doesn't,

classes of parents, custodial parents and non.

But you're saying he only

of parents.

I think it's not two classes

talks about continued custody, which we -- we think

means that (f) applies -- it presupposes that there is

custody to continue.

termination of parental rights.

14

And that's just a condition on the

17

would think if that's what they meant, they would say,

18

"where the child" is -- "is within the custody of a

19

When it's -- when it's framed that way, I

am -- I am inclined to believe that the "continued

custody by this person in the future.

7

the fact that -- that the whole provision only applies

8

to someone who is then in custody of the child, that's

9

very strange.

10
11

To read into it

That's -- that's not the way somebody

would write a provision like that.
MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I grant you it is

12

somewhat awkwardly written, but we think the sense of it

13

is -- is that because this is -- as this Court noted in

14

the Santosky decision, this is a very unusual statutory

15

provision with respect to the burden of proof.

16
17
18

And there is some logic for Congress
applying this -- this -- where there is a custodial -JUSTICE BREYER:

But doesn't it happen, in

19

your interpretation, unlike the two parties who have an

20

interpretation I can understand, that -- remember my

21

hypothetical, which I deliberately made dramatic.

22

can think of a whole range of things short of that where

23

the father has seen the mother never, perhaps, or sperm

24

donors for very short periods of time, and under your

25

interpretation where there is an ongoing relationship,

even a short one, at least they can't give the child to

2

the father where it would be very harmful to the -- to

3

the child.

4

But under your interpretation, the one

5

category of people who is exempt from that are the

6

category of fathers who've never seen the mother.

7

Who've seen the mother a very short time.

8

-- they're not even subject to looking to see if it's

9

very harmful to the child.

10

Who may be in

So I just -- am I right about your

11

interpretation having that effect?

12

that effect, what's the justification for it?

MR. KNEEDLER:

And if it does have

Well, the -- there's

several -- several things about that with respect to the

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

Okay.

right.
Now, let's suppose there is such a thing.

As long as there is such a thing, the anomaly that I

And if it exists, what's the basis for your

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's -- it's not as anomalous

5

as you're suggesting because state law standards still

6

apply, and under state law standard under Santosky,

7

there has to be clear and convincing evidence to

8

terminate -- to apply the State termination of parental

9

rights provisions, which is what the family court did in

10
11
12

this case.
This is -- this is a Federal overlay, an
additional requirement.

13

If I could, though, move on to --

14
