CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Texas v. The Federal Communications Commission and the

6

consolidated case.

7

Mr. Goldstein?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

10
11
12

very much.

Mr. Chief Justice, thank you

May it please the Court:
This case can get complicated, quickly,

13

because the word "jurisdiction" means a lot of different

14

things to a lot of different people, in a lot of

15

different contexts, and the parties have advanced both

16

broad and narrow theories for resolving the case.

17

the thing I can do, most helpfully, at the beginning, I

18

think, is to frame where I believe the real dispute in

19

the case lies.

20

So

The FCC claims the authority to interpret

21

Section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act with the

22

force of law.

23

question -- that threshold jurisdictional question,

24

which we call interpretive jurisdiction, Iowa Utilities

25

called it underlying jurisdiction, law professors like

And my argument today is limited to the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to call it Chevron Step Zero, but that's what I'm

2

focused on.

3

And the Fifth Circuit said that, on that

4

question, the FCC gets Chevron deference.

5

it gets to decide whether it has the authority to

6

interpret the --

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And that is

Mr. Goldstein, this case

8

has been presented in a very complicated way, but it

9

seems to me that what we're dealing with is a rule

10

adopted by the Commission, and the Commission's

11

rule-making power, as you know, is very broad.

12

They have power to make the rules needed to

13

carry out the provisions of the Act.

14

counts as a provision of the Act.

15

a proper implementation of that rule-making authority?

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

And 332 is --

So why isn't it just

Well, Justice Ginsburg, the

17

question on which you granted certiorari was how to

18

decide that question, not what is the answer to that

19

question.
What the Fifth Circuit did, acknowledging a

20
21

circuit conflict, was decided that the FCC's assertion

22

that you are right is, itself, entitled to Chevron

23

deference.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

on that, okay?
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Suppose you win

Official

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Or I -- I grant you, I

3

don't see any reason for that.

4

whether Congress intended them to have a degree of

5

discretionary power, but all the arguments that we hear

6

still count against you.

7

into the Chevron Step Zero or Step Minus Alpha 13.6, I

8

mean, fine.

9

The question is just

So -- so if you want to go

(Laughter.)
JUSTICE BREYER:

10

But, I mean, at some point,

11

I will hope you -- I hope you will go into what I'd call

12

the question of we have a statute, just as

13

Justice Ginsburg said, it's an expert statute.

14

statute in an agency that has all kinds of discretionary

15

authority.

16

question about what the relation is with the cable

17

television in this area -- post -- not cable, but -- you

18

know, the broadcast posts.

19

It is a

It includes an important substantive

And so all these factors here, which

20

suggest, of course, Congress, which is not expert, would

21

have wanted the FCC to figure this one out.

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

I --

That -- that -- at some

24

point -- you don't have to go into it at all, if you

25

don't want to, but I just want to put that on the table.
6

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

3

talk about it.

4

Justice Breyer, I do want to

I do hope --

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't have to talk

5

about it now, but you can talk about it whenever you

6

want.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

9
10

I appreciate it.

But I'd

like to talk about the things you want to hear me talk
about.

11

I am very conscious of the fact, let me say,

12

that the Court limited this grant of certiorari to the

13

first question presented, which was the abstract Chevron

14

question, and so I just don't want to jump the gun -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

15

But if the abstract

16

question really isn't presented -- I mean, just to

17

follow on what I asked you first, here is a phrase, "a

18

reasonable time."

19

phrase in a reasonable way.

And the Commission interprets that

Why is this case any more complicated than

20
21

that?

22

interpret that term, within a reasonable time?

23

Why doesn't the FCC have the authority to

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Ginsburg, you -- you

24

and Justice Breyer have both asked me to turn to that

25

question, so I'm going to do it.

The only point I'm

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

making is that all of these questions assume that we are

2

right on the question presented, which I think we

3

obviously are.

4

not want to hurry past the legal question on which you

5

granted certiorari.

6
7

So I'm happy to move on, but I just did

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, don't, because I

don't -- I don't think it's so clear.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Look, what you've told us

11

is jurisdiction means a lot of things, but what you mean

12

by it is real jurisdiction, right?

13
14

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I mean -- what I mean by

it -JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Chevron Step Zero

16

jurisdiction.

That doesn't clarify things very much for

17

me.

18

the FCC shall have no jurisdiction to establish time

19

limits within which the States must act?

What if -- what if the statute in this case said,

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

25

Okay?

Would that be a

jurisdictional question?

23
24

Yes.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That would.

That would

be -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

8
Alderson Reporting Company

What if the statute

Official

1

just said, the FCC shall not establish time limits

2

within which the States must act.

3

jurisdictional?

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

5

jurisdictional question.

6

question.

7

Is that

That is a different kind of

It is a jurisdictional

Justice Scalia, so maybe I can help you,

8

just on the question of what I'm talking about and

9

whether I can draw -- whether I can draw my line or

10

whether it's just malleable and every court's going to

11

get drawn into it, which I suspect you may be concerned

12

about.

Okay?

13

The kind of jurisdiction I'm talking about

14

is what you called, in your Iowa Utilities opinion for

15

the Court, "underlying jurisdiction."

16

Utilities, in the discussion of the FCC's underlying

17

jurisdiction, you undertook the judicial task of looking

18

at the words of the statute and figuring out that

19

Congress did intend, along the lines of the theory that

20

Justice Ginsburg just articulated, that the FCC did have

21

the power to implement those provisions of the '96 Act.

22

And, in Iowa

And in -- as we have rehearsed, to be

23

honest, every one of your Chevron opinions deals with

24

this question:

25

interpret this statutory provision with the force of

Just did the agency have the power to

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law?

You and the -- all of your colleagues on the Court

2

have always decided that question de novo.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I don't think so.

4

fact, I think we have said in -- in a number of

5

opinions -- and, certainly, I have said in a

6

concurrence -- that the jurisdictional question, like

7

any other question -- an alleged jurisdictional

8

question, like any other one, is to be decided with

9

deference to the agency.
Now, if you -- if you talk -- if you want to

10
11

limit your proposal --

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

I do.
-- to the -- to the entry

question --

15

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I do.
-- of whether the FCC has

17

jurisdiction to administer the Federal

18

Communications Act, I agree with you.

19

that without listening to the FCC.

20

a good deal short of whether, given that it does have

21

jurisdiction to administer the Federal Communications

22

Act, its implementation of this particular provision

23

goes beyond what its authority is.

24
25

In

I will decide

But that's -- that's

That seems, to me, a question of -- you can
call everything that's ultra vires in excess of the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

agency's jurisdiction, you can.

2

that's not what we mean by the entry jurisdictional

3

question, does the agency have authority to administer

4

this Act.

5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

But that's not --

Okay.

Justice Scalia, the

6

place where -- I do limit myself to the entry point and

7

the place where you and I are going to disagree is

8

whether the entry point is just the generic question,

9

does the FCC administer the whole Act or the somewhat

10

more narrow question, does the FCC administer this

11

statutory provision?

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there some statutes

13

where parts of the statute are subject to the agency's

14

Chevron rule-making authority and its zero plus one

15

jurisdiction and other parts are not?

16

mentioned the case by Justice Scalia -- and I'm not sure

17

that that involved that because it does seem to me, just

18

reading through, that "reasonable time," that sounds

19

like something that -- where we can have a specific

20

elaboration of what it means.

21

You just

And to say that the jurisdiction of the

22

agency or the authority of the agency does not extend to

23

rules seems a little odd at first.

24

federalism problems and so forth.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

I recognize the

Okay.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

The answer to

Official

1

your question is yes, and the best example is this

2

statute.

3

the -- the FCC does not administer all of the

4

Communications Act.

5

the Louisiana Public Service Commission case, in which,

6

there, Congress added to the Communications Act Sections

7

251 and 252.

8
9

It is uncontested and incontestable that

This Court so held, squarely, in

And there was a provision in that statute
that said -- that limited the scope of the FCC's power,

10

as we say Section 332(c)(7) does.

We will have to go

11

through that and debate that.

12

Act is plainly -- and there are other provisions as

13

well.

But the Communications

But the best example is the Louisiana PSC case.

14

And so --

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your

16

understanding of jurisdiction and what you're arguing

17

for today is nothing more or less than this is a

18

provision as to which Congress did not give the agency

19

law-making authority.

20

with respect to this provision because it's outside its

21

jurisdiction in the sense that it gets deference.

22

You do not defer to the agency

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

That is correct.

I would

23

only cabinet it in the following way:

24

the question on which you granted certiorari is does the

25

FCC get Chevron deference in its assertion that it gets
12
Alderson Reporting Company

And there's --

Official

1

to interpret 332(c)(7) with the force of law.

2

think --

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

Now, the

4

reason -- the reason we are hearing all about

5

jurisdiction and it's kind of dressed up --

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I

Yes.
-- is simply because

8

the means by which Congress made clear it was not giving

9

the FCC authority to get deference, however that is

10

phrased, is this 7(a), which speaks about nothing will

11

limit the authority of the States.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It's that --

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If it weren't for

14

that, if it were some other type of provision, that --

15

we wouldn't call it jurisdiction, but we would just say,

16

the FCC doesn't get deference to it.

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It would be a very easy

18

jurisdictional question.

19

332(c)(7) to establish the proposition that Congress did

20

not intend the general rule-making authority in Section

21

201(b) of the Communications Act to extend to 332(c)(7).

22

And those are --

23

We rely on two provisions of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's -- that's no

24

different from our holding in any case that the agency

25

has no authority to issue this rule.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

It has rule-making

Official

1

authority, but this rule goes too far, which is to say

2

Congress did not give the agency authority to go this

3

far.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6
7

Justice Scalia -It's -- it's always a

question of how much authority Congress gave the agency.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We disagree.

And I

8

understand that you have a vision of how Chevron

9

deference operates.

We disagree with it in this

10

respect, respectfully, and that is we believe that every

11

one of this Court's Chevron precedents has started --

12

sometimes, only in a sentence, because, often, it's very

13

simple -- often, it's uncontestable -- that it's a

14

provision of the Communications Act that does fall

15

within, for example, the FCC's 201(b) authority.

16

But it is always as -- you have always

17

approached that question as judges.

18

does the FCC have the power to implement this statute?

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

First, we decide

Well, Mr. Goldstein, at one

20

level, you are right.

It's just a level that doesn't

21

help you very much.

22

always, there is an initial question of whether an

23

agency is entitled to Chevron deference.

24

the way we answer that question is just this:

25

this the agency's organic statute?

I mean, it's -- it's true that,

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes.

But, usually,
We say is

Official

1

Does that organic statute provide the agency

2

with lawmaking power?

3

accordance with that lawmaking-- under that lawmaking

4

power?

5

go on to the next thing, which is Step One and Step Two.

6

So -- you know, we don't -- what we don't do

Yes.

Yes.

Has the agency acted in

Well, then, the agency gets deference.

We

7

is this sort of provision by provision, subsection by

8

subsection, did Congress have a special intent as to

9

this subject matter or that subject matter or the other

10

subject matter?

11

about what gets you into the box where an agency is

12

entitled to deference.

13

We've just had some very simple rules

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Kagan, I disagree.

14

I honestly disagree.

I'm going to give you three cases

15

that I think show that I am right and that your

16

articulation of your -- that approach is not correct.

17

And I encourage you to ask the Solicitor General what

18

his best case is.

19

Hospital, which I'll talk about.

It may be he thinks American

20

Here are my three cases:

21

Louisiana Public Service Commission,

22

provision by provision, the Court looked de novo at the

23

question of whether Sections 251 and 252 of the

24

Communications Act were subject to the general

25

rule-making power.

It said no.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Adams Fruit, another case where the

2

Secretary of Labor had general rule-making authority

3

over the agricultural worker protection statute.

4

the Court looked specifically at the private right of

5

action and said, your authority doesn't extend here.

6

And

And the last one is Meade, where the Customs

7

Service has the general authority to administer that

8

statute.

9

provision involved, and it said, do you have lawmaking

And, instead, the Court looked at the specific

10

authority with the respect to these interpretive rulings?

11

And so it has always done some --

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Did -- did it say, in all

13

of those cases, we give no deference to the agency's

14

contrary determination because this is a jurisdictional

15

question?

Did it say anything like that?

16

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It did not.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I have not --

I didn't think so.
Justice Scalia, I will tell

19

you this:

20

describing what happened in them, particularly on the

21

axis of whether the Court went provision by provision.

22

I am not overclaiming the cases.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I am

Very -- very often, I could

23

decide a case -- you know, the lower courts are running

24

away from the question of deference vel non because

25

things have been so confused by Meade.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

So they simply

Official

1

decide the question assuming no deference to the agency.

2

That doesn't prove that, in that particular case, the

3

agency wouldn't have been entitled to deference.

4
5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, let me tell

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Whether it was or not, it

you why --

6
7

would have come out this way.

8

don't -- don't prove what you say they prove.

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

So those three cases

Justice Scalia, here's why I

10

disagree:

11

reason, in that each of those three cases rejected the

12

assertion of jurisdiction.

13

applying, the Court would have had to find that the

14

statute was unambiguous.

15

of those cases.

16

I picked three cases for a very specific

And so that, if Chevron were

And it didn't do that in any

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And could you add that, in

17

those three cases -- or at least Meade, some respect was

18

given to the agency's due?

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

Yes, absolutely.
It was just not the sort

of deference that's so wooden under Chevron.

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Absolutely, Justice --

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But take Meade, Mr. -- I'm

24
25

sorry.

Did -MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I did.
17

Alderson Reporting Company

I agreed with

Official

1

Justice Kennedy vociferously.

2

end of my answer.

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That was -- that was the

And Meade presented --

5

whatever you think of Meade, it's a very different

6

question from this because what the majority in Meade

7

said was that the agency wasn't entitled to deference

8

because it was acting by way of these opinion letters

9

that weren't -- that didn't have the force of law.

So

10

that's the threshold question, is does the agency have

11

power to make rules with the force of law, and is the

12

agency exercising that power?

13

That is a threshold question that has been

14

set by this Court.

15

question from provision by provision, subsection by

16

subsection, did -- did Congress think that the agency

17

had authority over this particular subject matter or

18

not.

19

It's a very different kind of

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

I have two -- I have

20

three answers.

They will be brief.

Louisiana Public

21

Service Commission and Adams Fruit are as I described

22

them.

23

different axis than you've described.

24

the agency there had a general -- generally applicable

25

authority in which it could have urged that its

The reason that Meade is helpful to me is on a

18
Alderson Reporting Company

And that is that

Official

1

authority to issue those rule-makings, that it was

2

entitled to deference on its view of its power to issue

3

rulings with the force of law.

4
5

But the third thing that I want to say
is let me just take --

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Before you get to that, I'm

7

really surprised at your response to Justice Kennedy,

8

that you agree that, even where the agency has no

9

jurisdiction, although you won't give Chevron deference,

10

you will give whatever the other kind of deference.

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Skidmore.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why would you give Skidmore

13

deference, if some non-jurisdictional agency comes in

14

and says, hey, by the way, court -- you know, I think

15

this is the right answer?

16

respectfully.

17

why would you give it any deference at all, if there is

18

no jurisdiction?

19

Oh, we will listen to that

We won't necessarily give you Chevron --

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Because, Justice Scalia,

20

Skidmore deference is, as you know, of course -- and you

21

have been a very -- a very powerful critic of it,

22

obviously, in your opinions -- that it is the -- you

23

give the agency the respect of the persuasiveness of its

24

opinion.

25

that I was agreeing with Justice Kennedy was -- is, as

And I took -- or I -- the part of the comment

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Ginsburg has suggested, the FCC understands the

2

Communications Act.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And you might also have

4

said, it seems to me, that that assumes the issue --

5

assumes the premise.

6

jurisdiction or not?

8

the provision that we are talking about is (b), and (b)

And that
But

10

do not have, and among those limitations is that they

11

have to act within a reasonable time.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Okay.

I just don't understand

how the FCC's general rule-making authority is removed

You and

Justice Breyer have encouraged me to get to the merits

20

we think a court would look at this question de novo.

21

We have two points.

One is the statutory

22

provision, and this is going to be at pages 1 and 2 of

23

the cert petition, if you have that copy in front of

24

25

The statute -- and so, Justice Ginsburg, I

1

am going to answer your question, but I want to make a

2

couple of quick points about our offensive argument

3

about why it is Congress didn't intend the FCC to

4

implement the statute with the force of law.

5

It begins with preservation of local zoning

6

authority.

7

this paragraph, nothing in this Act" -- which includes

8

Section 201(b) -- "shall limit or affect the authority

9

of a State or local government with respect to this

10

Subsection (a) says, "Except as provided in

subject matter."

11

Then, in Subsection (b)(5) --

12

Justice Ginsburg, you said the essence of the statute is

13

(b).

14

enforcement power of this statute in the courts.

15

"Any" -- and this is it at the bottom of 2, "Any person

16

adversely affected by any final action or failure to act

17

by a State or local government or any instrumentality

18

thereof" --

19

In subsection (b)(5), Congress located the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are -- you are

20

skipping over (2), which is the phrase "reasonable

21

time."

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I -- I could read the whole

23

thing, Justice Ginsburg.

My point is going to be that

24

that "reasonable period of time" phrase is enforced

25

through the courts.

Now, Congress -22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

practical level --

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- what sense does it

5

make to read this to say that each time there is a

6

dispute that comes to the Court, the Court will decide

7

in that particular case, with no guide at all, what the

8

reasonable time is?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

I -- I will, now, turn to

10

that question.

11

explained by the conferees in the conference report at

12

page 209 of the petition appendix.

13

here is that -- that the House version of the bill

14

instructed the FCC to conduct a rule-making and the

15

rule-making would set standards for establishing a

16

reasonable period of time.

17

It makes enormous sense, and it was

And what happened

The Senate came along, which had no such

18

provision and said, no, we are going to have a provision

19

that, instead, says that nothing else in the Act will

20

apply to this question; that you will go to the courts,

21

rather than to have a rule-making, the rule-making must

22

be canceled, and then explained its intent.

23

could just read that to you, very quickly --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

and I'm just looking at the text, okay?

And so if I

Suppose I didn't know that,

23
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are innumerable

3

statutes which, after giving of the agency rule-making

4

authority, provide judicial -- you know, review under

5

this statute shall be held in such-and-such a court.

6

There is no conflict whatever between a

7

statement that any person affected can sue in Federal

8

court and the possession by an agency of rule-making

9

authority.

10

The -- the two simply don't conflict.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Justice Scalia, I -- my

11

point is that it is a point in our favor, particularly

12

when you compare -- (b)(5) has two parts, in addition to

13

the statutory history, which was -- told the FCC to

14

cancel the rule-making on this point.

15

says, you go -- on the reasonable period of time

16

provision, you go to the courts; and, on questions

17

related to radio frequency emissions, which is also

18

covered by (c)(7)(A), you go to the FCC.

Subsection (b)(5)

19

And what the conferees explained, quite

20

clearly, Justice Ginsburg, is that you can have two

21

different visions of what reasonable period of time is.

22

And that is a general -- this is -- the first one is

23

what the FCC you would expect to implement, and that is

24

a reasonable period of time is a general national

25

standard, a kind of baseline.

this:

Suppose there is a provision of this statute

5

which is very difficult to understand.

6

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.
Does that bear on the

8

Chevron Step Zero analysis on the question of what you

9

call jurisdiction?

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It does, Justice Kennedy.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

It seems, to

12

me, that Justice Ginsburg identifies a real point.

13

was looking at this statute, and I say -- you know, how

14

do I know when this agency has failed to act?

15

don't -- that's a very obscure data point.

When you have the opportunity to read it

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

3
4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

Let me start with a central point that I

6

think cuts through most of the arguments that Petitioner

7

has made this morning.

8
9

Chevron does apply to a court's review of an
agency's determination of ITS jurisdiction, but only

10

after a court concludes that Congress has delegated to

11

the agency, generally, the authority to make rules

12

carrying the force of law and that the rule in question

13

was promulgated in exercise of that authority.

14
15
16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

As -- as to that specific

provision?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, in general.

I think

17

that the language this Court used, taken from Meade,

18

last term in Astrue, in the unanimous opinion for the

19

Court in Mayo the term before, was is the authority --

20

is -- is the agency vested with authority, generally, to

21

make rules with the force of law.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's right,

23

but your argument it seems, to me, can't be -- let's say

24

you have a general statute, and you've got a provision

25

at the beginning that says this is -- authority to
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

interpret this is delegated to the agency.
And you go along, but then, all of a sudden,

3

in -- you know, Section 123, it says it doesn't get any

4

deference interpreting this provision.

5

not say that the first general one controls the specific

6

withdrawal of deference, would you?

7
8
9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Now, you would

I would not,

Mr. Chief Justice.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

You would say

10

you don't get deference on 123.

11

the case -- and that's why I persist in thinking there's

12

no great disagreement here, your friend on the other

13

side is saying that, particularly given 7(a) and some

14

other things, you should read 7(b)(2) as if Congress had

15

said, Agency, you don't get any deference here.

16

And, as I understand

You can read it that way, they say, because

17

7(a) says nothing shall limit what the State can do,

18

other than what's here in the statute.

19

the FCC -- if you give them deference, you're letting

20

something else limit what the State can do.

And, if you let

21

So why -- and then you dispute, it seems to

22

me, just whether that you should call that jurisdiction

23

or not because people think of jurisdiction as meaning,

24

oh, you don't get through the door.

25

mean by jurisdiction is simply that the agency gets no
31
Alderson Reporting Company

But, if what they

Official

1

deference on this point, then it seems to me everybody's

2

saying the same thing.

3

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Well, I'm not sure I

4

agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice, because I think the

5

point here is that to the extent -- once you've

6

satisfied that general threshold that I identified, then

7

to the extent there is ambiguity -- if the statute is

8

clear -- and in Your Honor's hypothetical I'd submit the

9

statute is clear at that point, that the agency -- that

10

the agency's authority has been carved out with respect

11

to that particular provision.

12

If it's clear, you don't get to the question

13

of whether there's any deference due.

14

when there's ambiguity.

15

The issue arises

And our position is --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Ambiguity in the

16

provision that says, Agency, you get no deference?

17

ambiguity in the substantive provision at issue?

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Or

Either one because -Well, but, if

20

there's no ambiguity on the provision that says you get

21

no deference, then it doesn't matter whether there's

22

ambiguity on the subsidiary one, right?

23

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That -- that's correct.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Okay.

But if there is ambiguity

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on the first, our position is that Chevron applies and

2

that the agency gets deference, so long as it's a

3

permissible construction of the statute.

4

true whether you call it jurisdiction and -- or whether

5

you call it substance.

6

And that's

And one reason for that, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

is that I don't think there is -- I do think this is

8

really a Pandora's Box situation.

9

is a clear, neat dividing line between what my friend,

10

Mr. Goldstein, describes as a jurisdictional issue, an

11

issue of interpretive authority, and a question of

12

substance.

13

I do not think there

And I think you can see that in the briefing

14

in this case.

15

jurisdiction in a particular way; the IMLA has defined

16

it in a very different way.

17

goes to the who, what, when, or where of an agency's

18

assertion of authority is a jurisdictional question, as

19

to which agencies get no Chevron deference in the course

20

of ambiguity.

21

Mr. Goldstein has tried to define

They say any question that

And the reason that IMLA gives for stating

22

that position is exactly the same reason that Mr.

23

Goldstein gives for stating his position, which is that

24

you're talking about an agency action in excess of the

25

scope of its delegated authority, and, once you say
33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, there's no Chevron deference.

2

And I would respectfully submit, once you

3

have got a situation in which it is clear that the

4

agency has general authority to implement and the

5

argument is whether its authority to implement has, with

6

respect to a particular provision, has been carved out,

7

at that point, Chevron deference is appropriate, and

8

that is the practice of this Court in repeated numbers

9

of cases.

10

American Hospital Association is certainly

11

one such case where the -- the NLRB had general

12

rule-making authority.

13

that said bargaining units needed to be determined by

14

the NLRB in each case.

15

that ought to be understood as a carveout from the

16

NLRB's general authority requiring case-by-case

17

decisionmaking with respect to bargaining units.

There was a statutory provision

And the argument was made that

18

And the Court rejected that argument, saying

19

that -- that, in that case, whatever ambiguity there was

20

in the statute ought to be resolved under Chevron in

21

favor of the agency.

11

de novo review.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Here's our answer to the

13

question presented, Justice Sotomayor:

14

novo review of the question of whether Congress has

15

delegated authority to the agency, generally, to act

16

with the force of law and whether the interpretation

17

claiming deference is an exercise of that delegated

18

authority.

19

That there is de

Once that is satisfied under de novo review,

20

Chevron kicks in.

Now, Step One of Chevron is, of

21

course, de novo review using the normal tools of

22

statutory construction to answer the question whether

23

Congress has spoken clearly on the issue of whether the

24

agency has authority.

25

has, then that disposes of the case.

If the answer is that Congress

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

If Congress hasn't, then one moves to Step

2

Two of Chevron and asks whether the agency's

3

interpretation of the provision at issue, whether you

4

call it substantive or whether you call it jurisdiction,

5

is a permissible construction.

6

of what the language can reasonably accommodate it?

7

And, if it is, the agency is upheld.

8
9

Is it within the bounds

That's the way we think the issue in this
case should be analyzed.

That's the way we think every

10

issue should be analyzed under Chevron.

11

what this case is -- this Court's cases say.

12

this is what the Court uniformly and routinely does in

13

analyzing these questions.

14
15

We think that's
We think

I think --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So deal with the three

cases he mentioned.

16

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Louisiana Public Service

17

Commission, a little bit of confusion, I think, about

18

that case.

19

added the sections Mr. Goldstein referred to, 251 and

20

252 of -- of the Communications Act, in 1996.

21

Louisiana Public Service Commission did was define the

22

outer limits of the Commission's authority.

23

That case was decided in 1986.

Congress

And what

It said nothing shall be -- nothing in this

24

Act shall give or -- shall be construed to give the

25

commission authority or jurisdiction over intrastate
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

communications, so it was an express carveout.

2

That seems, to me, had you had run that

3

through the Chevron analysis, it'd be a pretty

4

straightforward Chevron Step One case.

5

Adams Fruit, the - the Court held

6

specifically in Adams Fruit that the plain meaning of

7

the statutory provision at issue foreclosed the agency's

8

interpretation.

9

So that was a Chevron Step One case.

And that's at 494 U.S., at page 646.

It then did go on to say, with respect to

10
11

Chevron Step Two, that, even if we were going to think

12

about granting the agency deference here, they wouldn't

13

get it.

14

But I think the reasons -- if you map the

15

reasoning of Adams Fruit onto this case, it supports our

16

position and not Mr. Goldstein's.

17

in Adams Fruit was that the Department of Labor did have

18

the authority to implement the substantive provisions of

19

the Agricultural Workers Protection Act, including the

20

substantive provisions governing motor vehicle safety.

What the Court said

21

What it didn't have was the authority to

22

restrict judicial remedies available for the private

23

cause of action created under the statute.

24

Well, if you map that onto here, what the

25

FCC has done here with respect to the reasonable time
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provision in 332(c)(7)(B) of the statute was to provide

2

a rule of decision for the substantive provision of the

3

Act, leaving to the courts the decision of what remedy,

4

if any, there would be for a violation of those

5

substantive provisions.

6

And so it's -- it totally maps onto -- to

7

the FCC's interpretation of the right way to think about

8

statutory authority in this case.

9

sorry, Justice Breyer.

thousands of words which are in the U.S. Code, and there

13

are hundreds of thousands -- or millions of employees,

14

in millions of different kinds of agencies, and, if we

15

turn Chevron into the tax code, it's going to be a

16

nightmare -- in my opinion, not necessarily in that of

17

my colleagues.

18

So, as you know, I've written somewhat a

19

different approach.

And it says, let's not do this.

20

But just so, who would win here?

21

look, what we're interested in is just one question,

22

whether Congress wanted a court to give, in this kind of

23

situation, deference to the agency.

24

be, it depends.

25

isn't a straightjacket.

Suppose you just said,

And the answer will

Chevron is a good rule of thumb, but it

So what you'd look at here is it's the FCC

2

that is in charge of national communications, of which

3

this is part.

4

colleague points out, that says, "but don't interfere

5

with the States when they are citing stuff."

There is a specific provision, as your

6

But then there is a limitation to that

7

specific provision, which consists of six or seven

8

parts, all of which maintain a lot of authority in the

9

FCC or rules about what they are not supposed to do.

10

And then, here, it uses the word "reasonable."

11

So where you have a Federal agency with

12

expertise that's in charge of this kind of area and they

13

have rule-making authority, and you have a statute like

14

this, which is a little bit ambiguous, but not too, in

15

respect to the point about whether they do

16

interpretation, you'd add up those factors and make a

17

decision.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

20

simple -- I mean, that's Louis Jaffe.

That's everybody

22

until we get into a straightjacket.

And it isn't --

23

even Chevron doesn't go against us, if you don't think

24

of it as a straightjacket.

25

GENERAL VERRILLI:

That -- that's

Two points.

was Louis Jaffe.
GENERAL VERRILLI:

I understand that Your

Honor is the most recent proponent of this approach.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That -- that's no better.

Louis Jaffe isn't even a member of the Court.

11

(Laughter.)

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But -- but I think the

13

Court is in a different place.

14

in a different place for a good reason because I think

15

it's our interpretation of Chevron that avoids turning

16

it into the complexity of the Internal Revenue Code

17

because I think, if you think about what my friends on

18

the other side are proposing here, what they're

19

suggesting is that, once you've cleared that initial

20

hurdle of deciding the agency has general authority to

21

implement the statute with the force of law and that

22

this is an exercise of that general authority and,

23

therefore, not --

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think the Court is

I mean, I think you can

show, which I will spare you at the moment, all the

1

cases like Meade are consistent with what I said.

2

cases that are not consistent are consistent with what

3

Judge Friendly said years ago, where he said there is no

4

coherence to the Supreme Court's cases in this area;

5

when they like a result, they say they have deference,

6

and, when they don't like it, they say they don't.

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I guess I would beg to

8

differ about that.

9

Chevron does provide a stable framework for the

10

And

I think our -- our view is that

development of administrative law.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Justice Breyer would

12

replace that with a rule, where they like the agency to

13

have authority, it has it, and, where they don't like it

14

to have authority, it doesn't.

15

better than --

GENERAL VERRILLI:

With respect to the

23

issue -- with respect to the issue that's in front of

24

the Court now, I think the -- I think the -- what my

25

friends on the other side are asking is, actually, for
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

an additional layer of complexity in the analysis, even

2

after the general authority is established to -- to make

3

rules with the force of law and even after it's

4

established that the rule at issue is -- has been done

5

in the exercise of that, what my friend on the other

6

side suggests is there is another layer of de novo

7

review there to answer the question of whether this

8

particular provision --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
GENERAL VERRILLI:

10
11

Right.

Well --

-- gives authority to act

with the force of law.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your friend on the

13

other side has another set of arguments about why you

14

should treat this particular provision differently, and

15

that is because it concerns the authority, or lack

16

thereof, of State and local government agencies.

17
18

Now, does that play any role at all in your
analysis.

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We are not -- you

21

know, obviously, the dividing line between State

22

authority and Federal authority is a more significant

23

one than some of the other questions as to which

24

agencies get deference, which is whether rates are

25

reasonable or not reasonable.

And this provision is

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

written in terms of a preservation of State authority.
And your view would give the Federal agency

3

deference under Chevron -- very considerable deference

4

in defining when there should be Federal authority and

5

when there should be State.

6

pertinent consideration?

It applied the Chevron framework.
And it said it's Step One of Chevron because

the Migratory Bird Rule pushed to the very outer limits

of Congress's commerce clause authority, that the Court

Federal controls, those are vastly different

21

propositions.

22

That -- the idea that there is no

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes, but there is a third

23

variable here, and that's what's key, which is, in this

24

situation -- in 332(c)(7)(B), the limitations provision,

25

Congress has spoken, unambiguously, and said that the
45

following limitations on local zoning authority must be

2

respected.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

And no one has suggested

5

that that was at the outer limit of Congress's Commerce

6

Clause authority or anywhere close to it.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And --

But they have also

8

said -- they have also said, in (7)(a), that those are

9

the only limits, not add on to this any limits that

10

unelected bureaucrats might decide to impose, and will

11

give them -- and the courts must give them vast

12

deference in enforcing those limits.

think -- I do think that what Justice Scalia said is

correct, that the question here is not whether the

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Don't you -- don't you

3

think that the issue of whether unelected Federal

4

bureaucrats should decide it or unelected Federal judges

5

should decide it is an issue of separation of powers,

6

rather than an issue of -- of Federal/State relations?

7

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I do think -- in that --

8

in that respect, I think this case is really just like

Is it

AT&T v. --

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Okay.

In that -- in that -- the

15

argument there was that you ought not interpret the

16

FCC to have authority to implement particular rules

17

because Congress gave to State public utility

18

commissions the responsibility to carry out and execute

19

the rules and then, to Federal courts, the power to

20

review them and cut the FCC out.

21

And the argument there was that respect for

22

States ought to lead you to conclude not to apply

23

Chevron deference to the agency --

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Now -But, in rejecting

Official

1

that argument in Section 2 of the opinion, the author of

2

that opinion in nowhere, in no place, applied Chevron

3

deference in answering that question.

4

It was entirely de novo, unlike in Section

5

3, when it was finally decided, okay, we've got the

6

answer here, and, now, we will defer to the agency on

7

the substance of the determination.

8
9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I -- I understand that

the Petitioners made that argument, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

I read the opinion differently, and, if I could, I'll

11

explain why.

12

In Section 2 and looking at pages 384 and

13

385 of the opinion, after the Court had established that

14

there was general authority, under Section 201(b), to

15

implement the provisions of the Act, which I do think

16

the Court established de novo, and we would agree that

17

that's appropriate, the Court then moved on to consider

18

these specific jurisdictional questions.

19

And -- and the Court looked at the provision

20

of the statute which gave authority to the State

21

commissions and then considered the -- the argument that

22

one ought to infer from that, that the FCC's cut out of

23

the process.

24
25

And the -- the opinion of the Court says,
"We think this attributes to that task a greater degree
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

of autonomy than the phrase 'establish any rates'

2

necessarily implies."

3

It seems to me what the Court was saying

4

there -- and then, on the next page, says something very

5

similar about the next argument that the -- that the

6

challengers were making in that case.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

applying Chevron deference?

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But the

20

conclusion -- I think my -- my friend has suggested that

21

we weren't accurate in our discussion of the -- the

22

concluding paragraph of this phrase.

23

to turn the Court's attention to that because I think we

24

were.

25

But I would like

This is at page 397 of the opinion.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

GENERAL VERRILLI:

There is a sentence that

2

starts, "The 1996 Act can be read to grant most

3

promiscuous rights to the FCC vis-a-vis the State

4

commissions and to competing carriers vis-a-vis the

5

incumbents, and the Commission has chosen, in some

6

instances, to read it that way, but Congress is well

7

aware that the ambiguities it chooses to produce in the

8

statute will be resolved by the implementing agency.

9

can only enforce the clear limits that the 1996 Act

10

contains, which, in the present case, invalidate only

11

Rule 319."

12

We

Now, the jurisdictional dispute was the

13

dispute between the FCC -- the FCC vis-a-vis the State

14

commissions over who had the authority to implement the

15

rules.

16

So, while I -- I agree, Mr. Chief Justice,

17

that Chevron is not cited in that Section 2 of the

18

opinion, the tenor of that discussion does seem to me to

19

say that the Court was looking, once it had established

20

general authority, for clear evidence that Congress had

21

intended to carve out, from that general authority, the

22

particular provisions at issue and because the -- the

23

provisions to which the challengers pointed did not

24

necessarily imply an intent on the part of Congress to

25

carve it out, that the Court wasn't going to find a
50

Official

carveout.

So I do think that, really, the analysis in

22

that's it's -- it's, certainly, susceptible to further

23

elaboration in that sense.

24

to be asking me about the ambiguity with respect to the

authority of the (7)(A) --

Reasonable -- reasonable is

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Right.

And, in fairness

5

to my friends and as the Chief Justice has just

6

indicated, it's an inference from (7)(A), and I suppose

7

an inference from (7)(B)(v), and that -- and that the

8

courts are in the process.

9

But I do think this points up the difficulty

10

is that, if you -- if you look at the provision that the

11

FCC's actually implementing here, it's not a

12

jurisdictional provision; it's a normal substantive

13

standard.

14

That's what an agency's job is.

15

here.

20

You're talking about

(7)(B)?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

18
19

It's doing its job

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16
17

The FCC is giving it more precise content.

Yes, (7)(B)(ii), right,

exactly.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.

21

about (7)(A) that you think is ambiguous?

22

GENERAL VERRILLI:

What is there

We think it's -- it's

23

clear that the FCC has authority, given (7)(A), because

24

of the "except as provided in this paragraph" argument.

25

It's, I think, our friends on the other side who say
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that it's (7)(A) that creates uncertainty about whether

2

the FCC has the authority to implement the reasonable

3

time provision in (7)(B)(ii) -- and I think that points

4

up the problem of adding this additional step to the

5

analysis.

6

Once the Court has satisfied itself that the

7

agency has general rule-making authority, it's not going

8

to be hard to cobble together inferences to make

9

arguments on de novo review that the -- that the agency

10

lacked the authority to implement a particular provision

11

with the force of law.

12

And I think you're adding needless

13

complexity, and I do think -- the reason I suggested,

14

earlier, that I think this is a Pandora's Box is because

15

I do not think there's, at the end of the day, a

16

principled line that can be drawn between what my friend

17

describes as interpretive authority questions and the

18

kind of who, what, when, where substantive questions --

19

substantive jurisdictional questions that Respondent

20

IMLA is focused on.

21

In each of those situations, the argument is

22

that the agency has acted in excess of its statutory

23

authority.

24

review in the first instance, it's sufficient to justify

25

de novo review in the second instance.

And, if that's the case, then I would submit

that you have really unravelled Chevron.

4

stabilize the development of administrative law is gone.

5

The -- the

There will be an argument in every case

6

that -- that de novo review is required, and, in every

7

case in which a court agrees that de novo review is

8

required, once the court has interpreted the statute as

9

a matter of de novo review, then you have ossification

10

of the administrative process because that

11

interpretation is locked in.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I mean,

13

your argument there is basically saying, when the

14

statute says something is reasonable, it means that the

15

Commission doesn't have -- it's a jurisdictional

16

question whether it's reasonable or unreasonable.

quite a bit different.

conclude that Congress has spoken clearly and -- and

18

restricted the agency's authority.

19

But I guess what I would say, in this situation,

And there is no means -- there's no basis to

20

apply a clear statement rule here because Congress,

21

clearly, had the authority to impose the limitations

22

that it imposed in Subsection (B).

23

limitations on the State authority, and Congress made

24

that judgment.

25

And those are direct

It isn't the agency wading on -- in on its

own to decide that State or local authorities should be

2

subject to limitations.

3

These are judgments that Congress made, and

4

the agency is implementing them in very much the same

way that the Court found it was appropriate for the

6

agency to implement the preemptive scope of the word

"interest" in the National Bank Act in the Smiley case.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Verrilli, why isn't it

an easy answer to the whole case to read (7)(A), except

10

as provided in this paragraph, nothing in this chapter

11

shall limit or affect the authority of State or local

12

government?

14

Okay?

"Except as provided in this

And then later, in the paragraph, in the

15

subsection entitled, "limitations," it says, "A State or

16

local government shall act on any request for

17

That limits it.

Yes, that's exactly

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No.

I think the question

is whether the agency has the authority to flesh out the

3

substantive standard that the court will subsequently

4

apply --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, whether the --

6

whether the standard is defined in -- by -- through

7

direct judicial review or by the agency, with deference

8

to the agency.

9

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I agree with

10

Justice Scalia because -- because I do think that, no

11

matter what view of the matter the Court takes, the

12

FCC's rule ought to be upheld.

13

the -- the position my friends on the other side are

14

advocating threaten to unravel the -- the Chevron

framework and destabilize administrative law.

But I do think that

And I would urge the Court not to do it.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, if the -- if

18

the agency had said reasonable is 30 days, period, and

19

not done what it did, which was create a rebuttable

20

presumption, would that have been appropriate?

21

And, if not --

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Chevron is at an end.

It's unravelled.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

This

The Court has -- we have

20

cited to you 17 cases of yours in which you have always

21

looked at the entry point question de novo, and on

22

the -- the idea that we're making this more complicated

23

makes no sense to me because what the government

24

wants -- and you see this in the Fifth Circuit's

25

decision -- is a surround of Chevron on whether they

Go through that entire process, and then go

There's not a step that we're adding to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Goldstein, I

7

think, with respect, it's not silliness.

8

running as fast as you can away from the arguments that

9

IMLA has presented, that, in every case, it's a who,

10

what, where -- you know, or how question and that we

11

have to answer that.

12

You have been

But the question that General Verrilli

13

raises, I think, is a fair question, is how your

14

argument, which says that we have to consider in each

15

case as to each statutory provision whether an agency

16

has interpretive authority is any different from IMLA's

17

argument that we have to consider with -- in respect to

18

every case whether we're dealing with a when, what, who,

19

where question, or a how question.

20

argument; isn't it?

21

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It's the same

No, it is not.

This Court

22

has said, time and again, including in Meade, that the

23

precondition to the application of Meade is a

24

determination that Congress delegated authority to the

25

agency to interpret the statute with the force of law.
60
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And that has to be asked in every single

2

case, and that is a distinct inquiry.

3

that they have that delegated authority over that

4

provision, then, as -- as this Court has done in every

5

case --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Once you decide

Of course, there's a

7

threshold question, but the threshold question has

8

always been is the agency interpreting its organic

9

statute and is -- does that statute give the agency

10

rule-making authority and is that what the agency is

11

exercising?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

We are at loggerheads,

13

Justice Kagan.

14

Commission and Adams Fruit are just simply contrary to

15

that.

Congress gave the agency this 201(b) authority and then

17

implicitly gave the agency the authority to decide how

far 201(b) extends.

I believe that Louisiana Public Service

It also doesn't make any sense to believe that

This is just a question-begging

They say we have this general authority.

I

21

ask, does that general authority apply to this

22

particular provision in the Act?

23

our general authority gives us the power to answer even

24

that question, and that is not correct.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And they say, well,

Well, I guess I'm still
61

Alderson Reporting Company

1

waiting for -- for the -- the way in which your inquiry

2

is different from IMLA's inquiry.

3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

It is because I am only

4

asking the threshold question, did Congress give the

5

agency the power to interpret this statutory provision

6

with a question of law?

7

And that is a different -- I'll give you an

8

illustration, and that is there is an extended

9

discussion of this question in the FCC's order.

It had

10

no difficulty identifying that as a separate inquiry.

11

did want to just turn to the merits -- let me just say

12

that the Solicitor General's argument about whether the

13

201(b) authority extends to 332(c)(7) is a great

14

illustration of our argument on the question presented

15

because that's a lawyer's argument.

16

There was not a word that my friend said

17

about there was a technical question of communications

18

law and how wireless siting facilities operate.

19

the kind of question that Congress gives to agencies.

20

It is not the threshold lawyer's issue, does this

21

statute read this far?

22

I

That's

I would only encourage you, on the merits

23

question, which is not included in the question

24

presented, which you didn't grant certiorari on, that

25

is, the application of de novo review to this statute,
62
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to pay more attention than, I think, this argument has

2

given it because it wasn't the core issue briefed in the

3

case, obviously, to what Congress did in this statute.

4

There was a version of the statute that gave

5

the FCC the very authority that it is claiming here.

6

That was the House version of the bill that was rejected

7

in Congress, in conference, Congress adopted this

8

version, ordered the FCC to cancel the rule-making and

9

reserve this power to the courts, the -- the authority

10

to decide what is a reasonable period of time.
