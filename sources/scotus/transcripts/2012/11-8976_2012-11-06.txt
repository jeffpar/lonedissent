ORAL ARGUMENT OF A.J. KRAMER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. KRAMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

From the first Congress in 1790, Congress

12

has made the decision that all Federal statutes which

13

are, of course, creatures created by Congress in

14

statutes, should be subject to a statute of limitations;

15

in this particular case, five years.

16

conspiracy cases, as this Court said in Hyde, the

17

statute of limitations is treated a little differently

18

because conspiracy statutes are -- conspiracy crimes are

19

continuing offenses.

When it comes to

20

So the Court said the way we determine --

21

one way to determine whether a particular defendant's

22

involvement in a conspiracy has ended -- in other words,

23

his membership has ended -- is by the doctrine of

24

withdrawal.

25

It's the statute of limitations that is the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

defense in the case.

2

that triggers -- that is the triggering event for the

3

statute of limitations, which sets the date for when the

4

statute of limitations starts to run.

5

and of itself, is not a defense.

6

limitations that's the defense.

7
8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. KRAMER:

It's the statute of

Yes, but that -- is that an

No.

10

It's the doctrine of withdrawal

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It has to be raised by the

defendant, right?

13

MR. KRAMER:

14

initially -- I'm sorry.

It does have to be raised

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

Which means it's not an

16

element, so it doesn't have to be charged in the

17

indictment.

18

existence or non-existence of an affirmative defense be

19

an element?

20

Now, how can something that goes to the

MR. KRAMER:

Well, I don't -- it is -- it is

21

not an element, I agree with that; but it is -- I would

22

say that it's engrafted onto every Federal criminal

23

statute by statute.

This is not the common law, but by

24

Congress' decision.

I would also say that even though

25

it's not an element of defense -- of the offense, in
4
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Winship, this Court referred to the fact that the

2

government must prove every fact necessary to prove a

3

crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

4

necessary --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's a fact

But -- but you could

6

prove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a

7

reasonable doubt, if you never raised the statute of

8

limitations.

9

civil claims, as well as criminal claims.

10

And statutes of limitations exist for

And in -- on the civil side, the statute of

11

limitations is an affirmative defense.

12

the plaintiff to plead and prove -- both plead and prove

13

it, both the burden of production and persuasion.

14

should it be different on the criminal side?

15

MR. KRAMER:

And it's up to

I think several reasons.

Why

First

16

of all, obviously, the burden of proof is different in

17

criminal cases as the court said in Mullaney v. Wilbur.

18

It has been suggested that, because of the difficulties

19

in negating an argument that a homicide was committed in

20

the heat of passion, the burden of proof should rest on

21

the defendant.

22

And they said the same may be said of the

23

requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt of many

24

controverted facts, but this is the traditional burden

25

which our criminal justice system applies.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

I also think

Official

1

that the Court has distinguished on some grounds and is

2

the civil statute of limitations from the criminal

3

statute.

4

In fact, in the number of cases, this Court

5

has talked about the criminal statute of limitations.

6

It has never referred to it as an affirmative defense.

7

It has said it's a defense, but it has never said that

8

the defendant is required to prove it.

9

In fact, the Quick case said it's part of

10

the merits of the case; although it doesn't have to be

11

pleaded in the indictment, and the -- that it has to

12

be -- the government has to present evidence of it and

13

proof of it.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you -- I think you --

15

you recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden

16

of production, not the government, the burden -- burden

17

of coming forward with this defense and producing some

18

evidence of the withdrawal.

19

MR. KRAMER:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do

20

accept that there is a burden of production, as with

21

several other things that are not affirmative defenses,

22

like entrapment or alibi, also have a burden of

23

production before the government has to prove the

24

elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

MR. KRAMER:

It's -- it's not dissimilar to

those in that respect, and it does go to negate an

MR. KRAMER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, your argument

13

basically reduces to the fact that, when it comes to the

14

statute of limitations, you treat the conspirators as

15

individuals, rather than as members of the conspiracy.

13

not with respect to each individual.

14

MR. KRAMER:

So it makes sense to say you can prove the

15

just the opposite.

16

government -- if the defense -- if the claim of

17

termination is raised, the government has to prove that

the conspiracy continued into the limitations period and

19

that there was an overt act -- that was an overt act.

20

If -- under -- under Grunewald, the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But what the Chief Justice

21

indicates, it seems to me, is that if we accept your

22

view, then there is going to be a different statute of

23

limitations for each member of the conspiracy.

24

you have four or five different statute of limitations.

25

I find that -- I find that puzzling.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official

1

MR. KRAMER:

Well, actually, in this case,

2

there was different statutes of -- I believe there were

3

three different statute of limitations that the district

4

court instructed the jury about because there were

5

superseding indictments and people were indicted at

6

different times.

7

So there were already, in this case,

8

different statute of limitations.

9

reasons for withdrawal is to encourage people to get out

10

of the agreement, Justice Kennedy, then -- and try to --

11

try to thwart the agreement, then people may have -- may

12

come in and leave at different times during a

13

conspiracy.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But if one of the

What is -- is there any --

15

I'm trying to find an analogous instance without the

16

statute of limitations.

17

as an example, that you might have in your practice

18

found a different one, the Thomas Crown Affair.

19

that he robs the bank or the art museum, but he has an

20

intent to return it, and he produces evidence that he

21

had an intent to return.

22

And what occurred to me, just

Say

Now, in such a case, once he produces the

23

evidence, does the government have to prove beyond a

24

reasonable doubt that he didn't have an intent to

25

return?

Or does he -- is there any instance in which

3

MR. KRAMER:

Do you see what I'm

I do, and I think that there --

4

that an argument can be made if the intent -- if one of

5

the elements of that offense is to deprive the owner

6

permanently of the property and he did not have that

7

intent, the government would have to prove what it would

8

have to prove originally, which is that he intended to

9

deprive the -- the owner --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you have never found a

11

case -- I will ask the government this -- in the

12

substantive criminal law, no matter what, who is -- even

13

if the defendant is the only one ever likely to know

14

anything about it, you've never found a case where, once

15

the burden's produced, the -- the burden of persuasion

16

remains on the defendant?

17
18
19
20

MR. KRAMER:

That the burden of persuasion

remains on the defendant?
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, because you agree the

defendant has the burden of production here.

21

MR. KRAMER:

Yes.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

The fact that there is a

17

statute of limitations makes your case weaker, not

18

stronger, because -- because the statute of limitations

19

is less directly connected to the elements of the -- the

20

offense than is self-defense or duress.

MR. KRAMER:

I actually think it makes it

stronger, in the sense that Congress has made this

Let's say

8

that the -- the defense calls a witness other than the

defendant to testify to a conversation in which the

10

defendant allegedly withdrew from the conspiracy and, by

11

doing that, satisfies its burden of production.

12

Now, you say the government has the burden

13

to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, not only that this

14

conversation didn't occur, but also, that the defendant

15

never withdrew at any other time during the limitations

16

period.

Isn't that where your argument would lead?

No, I don't think they have to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MS. HARRINGTON:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

6

The Due Process Clause does not require the

7

government to disprove withdrawal outside the

8

limitations period because lack of withdrawal is not an

9

element of the crime of conspiracy.

This Court has been

10

clear that the Winship burden attaches only to things

11

that are elements in the constitutional sense.

12

something is an element in the constitutional sense,

13

then at least four consequences follow.

14

And when

As the Court has suggested, first, the

government has to allege in the indictment in every

statute of limitations --

Ms. Harrington --

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is true, but his

point -- basic point -- and he has responded to the
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

points I've made, is that, of course, if there's a

2

five-year statute on robbery, it doesn't help the

3

government that he create -- he committed a robbery

4

before.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

Correct.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So he's saying

7

what you charged in the indictment is that he was a

8

member of a conspiracy that existed between 1995 and

9

2005.

Now, that's the crime that concerns us, roughly.

10

And he is saying, to prove your case, you have to show,

11

as an element, that he was a member.

12

Now, you did present some evidence that he

13

was a member.

14

and has, that he wasn't a member.

16

enough to get -- make that an issue, you have to prove

17

beyond a reasonable doubt that he was a member.

18

have to show he didn't withdraw.

19

And he wants to present some evidence,
And he wasn't a

And therefore, once he presents

So you

Now, this has nothing to do with the statute

20

of limitations.

21

of limitations issue would be that you all agree that he

22

withdrew, but the question is did it happen in 1993 or

23

1997?

24

isn't.

25

By coincidence, it does.

But a statute

That's a statute of limitations issue, but this

This is a question of whether he was a

member of the conspiracy during the time period that you

is the response?

4

That's his point.

MS. HARRINGTON:

So what

So I guess I have two

5

responses.

6

limitations question, in the sense that the government

7

proved -- and there is no dispute about this -- that the

8

conspiracy that was charged did exist within the

9

limitations period.

10

The first is that it is a statute of

And so the question is just did

this particular member of the conspiracy --

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, in other words, you

12

can charge me or anybody in the audience or anybody here

13

with what?

14

a conspiracy?

15

member of the conspiracy in order for you to get a

16

conviction?

You are saying there was

Doesn't he have to be shown to be a

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

He does, and there's no --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's an element of

MS. HARRINGTON:

And an -- but when

19
20

the crime?

21

Petitioner talks about the membership or participation

22

element, what he is really talking about is the

23

agreement element.

24

each defendant who is charged with a conspiracy

25

intentionally agreed to join the conspiracy.

The government has to prove that

31
Alderson Reporting Company

And there

Official

1

is no dispute that the government proved that with

2

respect to Petitioner in this case --

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is no more relevance,

4

is there, to the fact that there happened to be a

5

pre-1995 conspiracy, except as a matter of proof -- I

6

shouldn't say relevance -- that he happened to rob a

7

bank before 1995?

8

criminal activity before 1995.

9

I mean, in each instance, there was

Now, you can use that in order to prove that

10

he was a member during '95 to 2000.

11

he, similar, can use the matter of withdrawal to prove

12

he wasn't a member during 1995 to 2000.

13

it goes to show whether you or the government have

14

proved an element of the offense, namely, that he was a

15

member between '95 and 2000.

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

That, I see.

But

And, therefore,

But, again, the element is

17

agreement, right?

18

the conspiracy, and we proved that each defendant agreed

19

to join the conspiracy.

20

that agreement happened in the limitations period, as

21

long as we prove that the conspiracy continues to --

22

So we prove that he agreed to join

We don't have to prove that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So how do we tell that,

23

Ms. Harrington?

Because it seems to me that the crux of

24

the difference between you and your friend is that you

25

say the element is membership in the conspiracy at some
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

point, it doesn't matter whether it's in the limitations

2

period.

3

conspiracy in the limitations period.

4

right, a set of things follow from that; and if you are

5

right, another set of things follow.

6

And he says the element is membership in a
And if he's

So how do we determine that the -- you know,

7

that the statute of limitations -- that the timing

8

question is not baked into the elements question, that

9

it's just membership sometime, as opposed to membership

10
11

at a particular time?
MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, we know it's not an

12

element for the reasons I explained because it doesn't

13

have to be charged in the indictment, it doesn't have to

14

be proved in every case, the defendant can waive it.

15

it's not an element in the constitutional sense, for all

16

of those reasons.

17

So

We can also tell that, in the specific

18

conspiracy context, it's not an element because this

19

Court's decision in Hyde from 1912.

20

defendant, Mr. Schneider, who had raised the statute of

21

limitations defense, had not done anything to

22

participate in the charged conspiracy within what was

23

then a three-year statute of limitations period.

24
25

In that case, the

The jury was charged, he didn't do anything,
the court said he didn't do anything.
33
Alderson Reporting Company

The court said,

Official

1

it's fine, he's still a member of the conspiracy because

2

he has not taken an affirmative act to withdraw from the

3

conspiracy.

4

So that's how we know that some sort of

5

active membership isn't an element of the crime, as long

6

as the government has proved, beyond a reasonable doubt,

7

that -- that the defendant joined the crime at some

8

point and that the -- joined the conspiracy -- excuse

9

me -- at some point, and that the conspiracy continued

7

indictment, but it --

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, let's assume it did.

Would -- would -- let's say, in a burglary indictment --

10

let's say the burglary occurred seven years ago, and

11

there is a five-year statute of limitations.

12

indictment just -- just accuses the individual of

13

conducting a burglary seven years ago, is that -- is

14

that indictment invalid?

15

MS. HARRINGTON:

If the

This Court -- this Court

16

has held since the Cook case that the -- the government

17

does not have to charge that -- the satisfaction of the

18

limitations period in the indictment.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So it's -- it's up to the

defendant to say, no --

21

It's up to the defendant --

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- seven years is too long.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

-- to raise it, right.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So I guess the issue here

25

is whether the government's statement that the
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

conspiracy existed within this five-year period causes

2

that to be an element of the crime?

4

been clear, that it doesn't cause it to be an element of

5

the crime.

6

once the government has proved that he willingly joined

presumes that every person who has willingly joined the

5

unless or until he takes some affirmative action to

6

withdraw from the conspiracy.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, I am looking at it

8

as a puzzle here because I think you could look at it

9

either way.

I mean, if a person commits a burglary and

10

the indictment charges that, and he says, yes, I did, I

11

did, there is no doubt about all the elements being

12

satisfied, but it happened outside the limitation

13

period.

14

That's in the statute of limitations area.
But where you charge a conspiracy taking

15

place within a period of time, as I would think you

16

usually would -- I would think the -- those words on the

paper almost always have a date in them -- then you

18

could look at it as a question of membership in that

19

conspiracy, the one that's charged, in which case, it's

20

a question of the elements.

21

And then, if you're in doubt as to whether

22

or not the time that he withdrew was inside or outside

23

the period, that becomes a limitations question.

I actually can see it either way.

MS. HARRINGTON:

I mean, I think it can't be

5

it or disprove it, depending on how you look at it.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, you have to prove

membership -JUSTICE BREYER:

12

instance, that you bring in a prima facie case.

13

repeating myself.

14

withdrawal is designed to negate membership.

15

You

I'd be

And that he says withdrawal, and

MS. HARRINGTON:

But withdrawal does not

16

negate membership because, again, membership is really

17

just the agreement.

18

tends to confirm that a particular defendant agreed to

19

join a conspiracy because there is nothing to withdraw

20

from if he didn't join --

21

And, in fact, a withdrawal defense

JUSTICE BREYER:

But then the withdrawal

22

prior to the time charged negates membership in the

23

conspiracy that you have charged because there was no

24

membership during that time.

25

MS. HARRINGTON:

It's true, but the

38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

government has to prove that the defendant joined the

2

conspiracy and the conspiracy continued to exist.

3

to bring you back to the Hyde --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Counsel, in a normal

5

case, where it's a robbery or burglary, whatever, you

6

charge the crime happened in X date, and the defendant

7

raises an affirmative defense that it's not within the

8

statute of limitations.

9

it does, in that situation?

10

MS. HARRINGTON:

11

Who bears the burden of proving

This Court stated, in

Grunewald, that the government bears the burden.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So, if you

13

bear the burden in the normal statute of limitations

14

case, the issue, I think, in my mind, becomes do you

15

continue to bear that burden in a conspiracy crime?

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because -- and you still

18

have to prove -- you're saying that the elements of the

19

statute of limitation there are that there was an

20

agreement to commit a crime, this person joined it at

21

any time during the conspiracy, and the conspiracy

22

continues.

23

MS. HARRINGTON:

24

Right.
You don't have to prove

that the defendant was part of that conspiracy or joined

2

that's your point.

MS. HARRINGTON:

We don't have to prove that

4

he -- that the agreement happened in the limitations

5

period or that any particular defendant did something to

6

sort of re-agree within the limitations period.

7

that, again, is clear from this Court's decision in

8

Hyde, where, in that case, the defendant raising the

9

limitations defense had not done anything related to the

conspiracy within the limitations period.

argument that the very definition of a conspiracy is a

statute of limitations defense operates within the

25

conspiracy context is it asks the question whether and

2

affirmative defense of withdrawal is actually an

3

affirmative defense, even within that affirmative

defense, because it asks the question whether a

10

held in Patterson that the government didn't need to

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Ms. Harrington, would you

13

agree that, as this argument is developing, what is

14

really at issue has less to do with the statute of

15

limitations than the nature of conspiracy?

16

is Petitioners', and it's embodied in some of the

17

questions that has been -- that have been asked, and

18

it's this:

19

as a member of a conspiracy.

20

And one view

That the crime is continuing to participate

And the other view is that a conspiracy is a

21

dangerous thing.

It's like rounding up a -- a pack of

22

lions or wolves or setting loose some thing that

23

continues to be a danger; and if you do that thing, by

24

joining it, you are liable, criminally, for everything

25

that happens after that, even if, at a certain point,
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you walk away, and you do nothing.

2

Now, if -- if he's right, that it is active

3

membership, then there may be a problem for you here.

4

But if the other view is correct, that you are liable

5

for setting this thing in motion, whether or not you

6

continue to do anything active in support of it during

7

the limitations period, then you are correct.

8

Now, which is the -- which is the

9

established view of the crime of conspiracy?
MS. HARRINGTON:

10

The view established by

11

this Court is that the crime of conspiracy continues,

12

and once a person joins the conspiracy, he or she is

13

liable for all the acts of his co-conspirators that were

14

reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of the conspiracy.

15

And that's true, even if that person, once he joins the

16

conspiracy, doesn't ever do anything else --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but you recognize --

18

you recognize, as I think Justice Alito's question

19

doesn't, that there is -- there is a withdrawal defense

20

and the question is how do you allocate the proof

21

burden?

22

So your case accepts that there is a

23

withdrawal defense.

Indeed, the judge gave a charge to

24

the jury on -- so the contest, as I understand it, the

25

difference between the two of you is you say, defendant
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

can say, I withdrew.

If he does that, he has to prove

2

it.

3

enough, so that a jury could find I withdrew, but you

4

have the ultimate burden of persuasion.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

And the defendant is saying, I have to produce

That's right.

And the

6

Petitioners' view is grounded in due process concerns.

7

Our view is that it is not a matter of due process

8

because lack of withdrawal is not an element of the

9

crime of conspiracy.
So once you take due process out of the

10
11

equation, then you have to ask what -- where would

12

Congress have understood the burden -- the allocation of

13

burdens to be, when it enacted these conspiracy statutes

14

in 1970?

15

And as a matter of logic, as a matter of

16

history, as a matter of policy, there is no reason to

17

think Congress would have thought the burden of

18

persuasion to be anywhere other than on the defendant.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And I suppose that a

20

conspiracy is defined by relation to its criminal

21

objects, not to its membership.

22

that conspired to rob a bank and one of the conspirators

23

has said, I'm out of here, I withdraw from the

24

conspiracy, metaphysically, you might argue, well, it's

25

a new conspiracy because it's a new group.

If there's five people

46
Alderson Reporting Company

I take it.

3

MS. HARRINGTON:

4

opposite.

5

and go in a conspiracy and --

7

10
11

It has said that -- you know, people can come

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because it's the criminal

objects that define the conspiracy?

8
9

No, this Court has said the

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's right.

And, again,

there's no dispute in this case that the conspiracy was
ongoing.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

12

you've indicted -- you haven't indicted a conspiracy.

13

You've indicted an individual, and it's not clear to me

14

why you don't have to show that that was -- that that

15

individual's conduct was within the statute of

16

limitations period.

17

MS. HARRINGTON:

Because once --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

At least, when he

19

comes forward with -- under the burden of production,

20

with evidence suggesting the opposite.

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, again, if we can take

22

the due process part off the table -- because we think

23

it's not an element of lack of withdrawal, then you ask

24

sort of, you know, what -- how would Congress have

25

understood the state of the law to be when it enacted
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

these crimes, that's how the Court approached this

2

question as to duress in Dixon.

3

I think, as a matter of logic, because the

4

government can prove that someone is liable for a

5

conspiracy by proving that he joined a conspiracy at

6

some point and that the conspiracy existed in the

7

limitations period, it wouldn't make sense to require

8

the government to disprove withdrawal, once it's

9

asserted --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but Mr. Kramer

11

says it's not that big a deal, I mean, you don't have to

12

do -- he says you don't have to do anything at all.

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think that's kind of a

14

remarkable assertion.

15

be disprove withdrawal, once the defendant asserts it

16

beyond a reasonable doubt, it's hard to imagine why the

17

government would ever -- once a defendant makes a prima

18

facie case of withdrawal, when the government would ever

19

just say, oh, well, we'll sort of rest on our laurels

20

and rest on the -- the evidence we have proving that he

21

joined the conspiracy outside the limitations period.

22

If what he's saying is we have to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Suppose this thing doesn't

23

come up in the -- in the statute of limitations context.

24

Suppose it comes up in the context of whether this

25

defendant is liable for an act committed by the
48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

co-conspirators after he withdrew.

2

issue of whether -- whether he withdrew or not, before

3

the murder of somebody, okay?

4

So it's the same

He said -- you know, before that occurred, I

5

was out of the conspiracy.

6

about -- about proving it in that context?

7

burden on the defendant?

8

prosecution?

9

What do our cases say

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

the -- the burden stays on the defendant to prove that

16

he withdrew from a conspiracy in that context.

17

Pinkerton liability isn't at issue here, so you don't

need to -- to wrap that up into this case, but our --

17

And that was the reason we gave for the

First of all, there's evidence that the

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I make sure I

5

understand one part of your argument, Ms. Harrington?

6

The conclusion that timing -- the timing is not an

7

element.

8

something which is not a conspiracy at all, let's say

9

somebody commits a robbery, and you have to show that

Now, take Justice Sotomayor's example of

10

the person has committed a robbery and if the person

11

brings up the question of timing, you also have the

12

burden of persuasion on that.

13

an element in that case or not?

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But would the timing be

Not.
And so you are essentially

16

saying that this case should be treated just as every

17

other case.

18

if somebody says the statute of limitations has been

19

violated, but the question of when conduct occurred is

20

never an element.

21

You happen to have the burden of persuasion

MS. HARRINGTON:

It's never an element.

It

22

is true that the government -- if a defendant raises a

23

statute of limitations defense, the government has the

24

burden of proving that the crime was committed within

25

the limitations period.

This Court said that in
51

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Grunewald.

2

but we have accepted that as our burden.

3

It did not offer any explanation for that,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why is it then -- I mean,

4

why would Grunewald be right, that you do have the

5

burden if, in fact, this isn't an element?

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

I think, just because it

7

is an -- it is a burden that is placed on the government

8

by Congress in Section 3282.

9

reason one could think that it makes sense is that the

10

government already has to prove all the things that it

11

needs to prove, to prove that the crime actually

12

happened.

13

I think -- I think a

And generally, in proving that a crime

14

actually happened beyond a reasonable doubt, you also

15

prove when the crime actually happened.

16

doesn't really add very much to what the government's

17

burden already is in proving the crime.

18

And so it

But that sort of leads me into sort of the

19

policy reasons for not allocating a burden of persuasion

20

to the government as to the issue of withdrawal.

21

there are sort of four big reasons why Congress wouldn't

22

have understood the burden to be -- for policy

23

reasons -- wouldn't have understood the burden to be on

24

a defendant as to the issue of withdrawal.

25

And

The first is that the defendant will almost
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

always be in a better position to have the information

2

about whether he withdrew, except in cases where he

3

withdraws by making a clean rest with the government, in

4

which case, it's hard to imagine he's going to be

5

indicted for -- for the indictment past that period,

6

except in those cases, he will know what he said in

7

secret to his co-conspirators.

8

Second, the government will often be

9

prevented from bringing up evidence to rebut an

10

assertion of withdrawal because it can't make a

11

defendant testify, and it often won't be able to make

12

his co-conspirators testify.

13

Third, a defendant doesn't have to give any

14

advanced notice of his intention to rely on a withdrawal

15

defense, and so often, he can scuttle the defendant's --

16

the government's ability to procure any other evidence

17

it may be able to procure relevant to the issue of -- of

18

withdrawal.

19

And, fourth, Petitioner's role would

20

encourage spurious assertions of withdrawal because it

21

has -- it could have the effect of essentially making

22

the government prove something extra.

23

prove that he joined the conspiracy willingly, that the

24

conspiracy existed in the limitations period.

25

It already has to

But under the government's -- under the
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Petitioner's role -- excuse me -- the government would

2

also have to prove that the defendant essentially took

3

some other act to show his membership or somehow

4

re-agreed to the conspiracy --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that last

6

point seems to me spurious itself because, to prove

7

withdrawal, he's got to accept the fact that he was in

8

the conspiracy in the first place.

9

have a good withdrawal defense, it's unlikely that he

So if he doesn't

10

would raise it because it would cost him any argument he

11

has against participation in a conspiracy in the first

12

place.

13

MS. HARRINGTON:

But in cases where -- such

14

as this, where a defendant goes through a period of

15

inaction with respect to the conspiracy, which this

16

Court said in Hyde is not enough to withdraw, then there

17

would be an incentive to raise a spurious assertion of

18

withdrawal because it would require the government to

19

sort of -- to rebut that by proving that the defendant

20

had done something within that period, which it doesn't

21

have to prove in order to establish liability.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I suppose he could present

23

his defense in the alternative, I didn't belong to the

24

conspiracy, and anyway, I withdrew.

25

both of those points, can't he?
54
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, he can make

Official

1
2

MS. HARRINGTON:

He certainly can.

I think

there's a good deal of risk in that for a defendant.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I mean,

4

that works in a civil case.

But, I mean, in a criminal

5

case, it's kind of a big thing to say -- begin my -- my

6

first argument is that, I withdrew from this horrendous

7

conspiracy that's been going on.

8

MS. HARRINGTON:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

13

Or then I wasn't a

part of it after that.

11
12

That --

That's a little different in a criminal
context.
MS. HARRINGTON:

It's true.

And the theory

14

of defense in this case was, in fact, that there were

15

many separate conspiracies, not that any particular

16

person had withdrawn, and it only came up, as my friend

17

pointed out, because the jury asked a question about it.

18

If I can just sort of wrap up on a -- on a

19

broader note?

A defendant does not become liable for a

20

21

in this case, the government has to prove that every

defendant was aware of the existence of the conspiracy,

23

that every defendant understood that it had an illegal

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Which is what your

friend is trying to argue for in this case?

3

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

But that is -- this

4

is high evidentiary burden that the government has to

5

bear to prove that each defendant took some affirmative

6

action to get into the conspiracy.

7

the government proves that a defendant was a member of

8

the conspiracy, then it's on the defendant to prove --

9

to take some affirmative action to get himself out of

10

And once the -- once

the conspiracy.

11

And it only makes sense to require him to

12

prove that he took that act, instead of requiring the

13

government to prove negative that he didn't take that

14

act in every case.

15

If there are no further questions?

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is this -- the burden

17

allocation, is this a more hypothetical academic

question?

19

evidence to show that he remained a member of the

20

conspiracy.

21

I mean, you pointed out that you had ample

So does the allocation of burden of

22

persuasion to the defendant versus proof of production

23

to the defendant, persuasion to the government, does it

Does it have much

14

withdrawal caused by his incarceration.

15

definitely can come up.

I think the crux of your

argument is that the government is going to have to

prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

I thought you argue that

proved beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution

23

hasn't provided sufficient evidence?

stands up and says, we presented plenty of evidence

And that happens every day, needless to say, that people

are convicted by that argument when --

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Kramer, if they

5

really have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that

6

there is membership in the conspiracy during the

7

limitations period, they couldn't just come in and say,

8

well, there's membership in the conspiracy before the

9

limitations period, and, you know, you should assume

10

that it continued.

12

I mean that's not a
beyond-a-reasonable-doubt kind of proof, is it?

MR. KRAMER:

They get a permissive

inference.

15

would be proof beyond a reasonable doubt for a jury,

16

absent some conflicting evidence presented by the

17

defendant, more than just a proffer.
