ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BISHOP:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
There is a straightforward ground for

13

reversal here that rests on a standard application of

14

deference principles to EPA's treatment of stormwater.

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Before -- before we

get into that, congratulations to your clients -­

17

MR. BISHOP:

Thank you.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- getting almost

19

all the relief they're looking for under -- under the

20

new rule issued on Friday.

21

MR. BISHOP:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Thank you.
And thank you for

calling it to our attention.

24

MR. BISHOP:

Thank you.

25

The problem with that rule is that it puts
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

into place something that EPA has been telling the

2

courts throughout this litigation, that in the

3

stormwater rule, where EPA refers to Standard Industrial

4

Classification 2411, that what it is referring to is

5

solely the four identified point sources in the

6

silvicultural -- rock crushing and so on.

7

In this case, NEDC Respondent argues that

8

the statute -- the language of the statute, which is

9

that discharges that are associated with industrial

10

activity must have NPDES permits, prevents EPA from

11

doing that -­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there was no ruling

13

in the court of appeals.

The court of appeals did not

14

rule on the statute -- whether the statute mandates that

15

these logging roads be governed.

16

MR. BISHOP:

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

MR. BISHOP:

19
20
21
22

No.

It did not.

It did not.

So is -­

That is an argument that

Respondents have made in this Court.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And so that's not a point

that this Court could resolve in the first instance.
MR. BISHOP:

Well, I don't think that's -- I

23

don't think that's right.

The -- the Respondent can

24

defend its judgment on grounds other than those that

25

were -- that were the basis of the Ninth Circuit
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

decision.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, you can do that; but

3

this Court is a court of review, not first view, and we

4

don't take questions that haven't been aired below.

5

MR. BISHOP:

Well, there -- there is an

6

additional reason why we don't think that the rule here

7

moots -- moots the issue.

8

there is a petition for review.

9

Let -- let's assume that

I think that's a fairly safe -- safe

10

assumption, that some environmental groups argue that

11

the new rule is impermissible because it's at odds with

12

the language of the -- language of the statute, an

13

argument that I think is -- is near frivolous, but that

14

I think will be -- predictably will be made.

15

The rule is prospective.

What we have is a

16

judgment from the Ninth Circuit that says that we were

17

in violation for decades by not having permits.

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -­

Well, but it's -­

it's an unusual situation for us to rule in a case -­

20

MR. BISHOP:

Yes.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- where the issue

22

has ongoing significance and that's taken away.

23

what we would be doing is, when there is a new rule, we

24

would be considering quite a lot of difficult issues to

25

determine what the old rule was, so that you can unravel
6
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

what the Ninth Circuit has upheld.

2
3

MR. BISHOP:

Well, let me argue -- let me -­

maybe -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought the case law

5

was fairly clear that, when the EPA changes its rules in

6

your favor, that they can't -- the court can't impose

7

penalties for a past violation.

8
9

MR. BISHOP:

Well, I wish it were so clear.

Certainly, we think that that is the case.

10

What they've asked for below is penalties,

11

attorneys' fees, and remediation of environmental harm.

12

Now -- now, we think that, under Laidlaw, they shouldn't

13

be able to get any of those three things.

14

Now, this only happened on Friday, so I

15

can't claim that I've done complete research on -- on

16

the point.

17

doesn't appear to be any law on the application of

18

Laidlaw to a claim for remediation.

19

But it -- you know, I do think that -- there

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this a -- is this

20

a new rule that they -- I too haven't had much of a

21

chance to look at it.

22

an amendment of the existing rule?

23

MR. BISHOP:

But is this a new rule?

Or is it

It's an amendment of the

24

existing rule.

But what it does is to put into place

25

against the rule exactly what EPA has been saying

throughout this litigation.

2

rule.

3

There is nothing new in the

So this is something that EPA has been

4

saying in the litigation and that we think is entitled

5

to Auer deference as a result of that.

6

rule, so it gets -- it gets Chevron deference.

7

we -­

8

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
want what you're asking for?

Are you sure you

What if we go ahead and

Well, we are -- we are hoping

12

that you rule -- you'll rule with us.

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

But

decide this case and rule against you?

11

16

Now, it's in the

And certainly, on

That's usually the

objective.
MR. BISHOP:

On the basis of this rule, you

18

have to understand that the challenge to this rule is

19

the claim that the -- the words "associated with

20

industrial activity" must be interpreted by EPA to

21

include harvesting activities and the -- the moving of

22

the logs out of the harvest area.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, that's -­
Now, I suppose that

24

your clients and others similarly situated -- or I -- I

25

guess it would be the Respondents -- can challenge the
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

new rule, right?

2

MR. BISHOP:

Yes.

So -­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you would have,

4

simultaneously pending, a case involving the

5

interpretation of the old rule and a challenge to the

6

new rule.

7

MR. BISHOP:

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9
10

Right.
Each of which would

have the same issue.
MR. BISHOP:

And this Court can cut through

11

all of that by deciding this case, which the simplest

12

way to decide this case is under the stormwater rule.

13

If the Court decides this case in our favor under the

14

stormwater rule, then that will preclude a large part of

15

the basis for the challenge to the new rule.

16

It's squarely in front of this Court.

17

Mr. Fisher has made the argument here.

18

rule is squarely here.

19

Clean Water Act's approach to stormwater in 1987, and it

20

made clear that, as a default, point-source stormwater

21

is regulated by the State, with NPDES permits required

22

only for discharges that are associated with industrial

23

activity and a few other categories.

24
25

The stormwater

Congress completely revamped the

And those statutory terms, "industrial
activity" and "associated with," are both ambiguous.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And with those words, Congress left EPA with discretion

2

to determine what activities count as industrial.

3

it's in keeping with dictionary definitions for EPA to

4

have categorized activities like law, banking, retail,

5

agriculture, and silviculture as not industrial.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

But, Mr. Bishop, as -- as

7

Justice Ginsburg said, that question was not decided

8

below, and in the context of this case, which, of

9

course, was very different when it was briefed,

10

Mr. Fisher spent a grand total of 2 pages and rightly

11

so.

12

the case then.

It wasn't -- it was -- it was not the main issue in

13

So would we really be doing something -- you

14

know, a good practice to decide this issue, without

15

really any briefing on it and without a decision below?
MR. BISHOP:

16

Well, I think there is briefing

17

on it.

I mean, both parties have briefed it.

18

pages because it's a -- a near-frivolous argument under

19

the -- under the caselaw, I think.

20

you don't -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

It gets 2

But the fact is, if

Well, that isn't really

22

quite fair.

It is 2 pages because it wasn't decided

23

below and because -- and because the -- the question in

24

the case was very different, with a different

25

regulation.
10
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. BISHOP:

Now, the issue is before this

2

Court.

If the Court doesn't decide the issue, then we

go back.

5

adjudicated past violation under Laidlaw.

We have to fight for years about remedies -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Laidlaw

You wouldn't have to do

8

anything if the Court vacated the decision below.

9

you wouldn't be facing anything.

10

MR. BISHOP:

Well, obviously, if the Court

11

held the case was moot, then we'd like the -- the

12

vacatur.

But in addition -­

that you're entitled to it and we agree with you, then

-- what's left at that point is

3

another 5 or 6 years of litigation under the new rule on

4

an issue that is briefed in this Court, before this

5

Court, and I think relatively easy to decide under the

6

stormwater rule.

issue are you talking about?

9

10

MR. BISHOP:

Are you -- which

12

very complex, I think, because of -- of the -- you know,

13

the government has raised the Seminole Rock argument

14

that -- that no one's ever heard of before.

15

has introduced an argument about whether the 1375(b)

16

categories -- this case falls within those categories.

17

I mean, the -- the rest of this case has become

Mr. Fisher

But there is a simple way to decide this

18

case, and that is, under the stormwater rule, EPA had

19

the discretion to determine what activities are

20

industrial, and it determined that timber harvesting is

21

not industrial.

22

a way that does not cover these -- these roads, even if

23

it were industrial.

24
25

It defined "immediate access roads" in

And these are terms -- the term "industrial"
is one that is ambiguous.

The term "associated with

like the word "minimized" -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's

How do we -- how do we

4

avoid, under your reading -- assuming we agreed with you

5

what the rule says, that there is a difference between

6

logging roads and access roads?

7

lot of question about whether these, in fact, are access

8

roads or not.

9

11
12

So do -- do we need to -­

MR. BISHOP:

10

The other side raises a

The public -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do we have to reach that

issue then?
MR. BISHOP:

The public -- no, you don't

13

have to reach that issue because the EPA has decided

14

that the timber harvesting activity is not industrial.

15

In the rule -- implementing this rule with a -- a

16

multisectored general permit for industrial activity,

17

EPA said, quote, "Harvesting activities, including

18

loading and initial transport from an active harvest

19

site, are not required to be covered under the

20

stormwater permits."

21

You know, it's been perfectly clear in -­

22

when it promulgated the rule, it said that the reference

23

to SIC 24 was a reference to sawmills, planing mills,

24

and other mills.

25

it -- it explained the reference to SIC 2411, it said,

When, in the briefs in this case,

MR. BISHOP:

So how do we -­

-- absolutely clear that timber

harvesting is not industrial activity -­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. BISHOP:

10

So it's -- EPA has

It may not -­

-- and, therefore, it does not

get to the "associated."

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It may not be, but these

12

are pipes, ditches, and channels which the CWA

13

explicitly defines as point sources -­

14

MR. BISHOP:

Well, you can -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that are not part of

16

the harvesting.

17

They're -- you're saying public roads and not access

18

roads.

19

By definition, they are not.

MR. BISHOP:

Well, remember that the

20

stormwater rule applies to point sources.

The default

21

position under the stormwater rule is that point sources

22

do not require NPDES permits.

23

there are certain categories that do, and one of those

24

is discharges that are associated with industrial

25

activity.

And then Congress said

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

EPA has said that, under these terms,

2

"associated with industrial activity," "in industrial

3

activity," neither the timber harvest nor the roads,

4

"The initial loading and initial transport from an

5

active harvest site are not required to be covered by

6

stormwater permits."

7

It says, in the rule, that immediate access

8

roads are the only things that are covered.

9

explains, in the preamble to the 1976 rule, that that

10

means on-plant roads that are dedicated for use by an

11

industrial facility, not public roads.

a few weeks, every few decades, for logging activities.

17

And so these are not, EPA has been very clear, the sort

18

of -­

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

These are

Am I correct or incorrect

20

that a considerable number of these roads are -- a

21

significant number of these roads were built initially

22

by the logging industry?

23
24
25

MR. BISHOP:

Yes, some -- some of them

surely -- surely were.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's a little hard for

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you to say that, when these were built by the logging

2

industry and presumably maintained to some respect by

3

the logging industry, to say, oh, well, these are used

4

by hunters and so forth.

5

MR. BISHOP:

I -­
But -- but they are public

6

roads.

They are owned by the counties, or they're owned

7

by the State.

8

talking about here have been there between 50 and 75

years.

These two particular roads that we are

They run by the river.

There is a school bus

There -- these are -- these are

quintessential public roads that are used by loggers

14

from time-to-time.

15

Are there other roads that are built by us?

16

they are public roads maintained by us under contracts

17

with the State, only during the period when we are using

18

them for -- for logging activity, and otherwise

19

maintained by the -- by the State.

20

Are they -- are they built there?
Yes.

But

So the -- and we think -- to come back to

21

your -- your initial question, Chief Justice, about

22

whether this can be decided without getting into these

23

other complex issues -- that you don't have to -- if you

24

decide this case under the stormwater rule, it's -- and

25

taking at face value what the Ninth Circuit said, which
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is the rule itself is not clear, we see the Ninth

2

Circuit set a reference here to SIC 2411, which is

3

logging.

4

We see this reference to immediate access

5

roads.

can I understand what's still at stake for you in -- in

17

is correct at this point?

18

Put aside the question of whether the new

19

is a vacatur, so that we don't have to worry about

20

remedies below -­

21
22
23

But

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So which remedies are you

worried about?
MR. BISHOP:

Well, the remedies that we -­

24

we are obviously not worried about injunctive relief.

25

We are worried about the relief that they have asked
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for, for past -- supposed past violations, which is

2

penalties, attorneys' fees, and I think the more complex

3

one under the case law is remediation for environmental

4

harm, which the case law just doesn't seem to address

5

under -- under Laidlaw.

6

So we are worried about those.

And

7

principally, what we would like to do is to get sorted

8

out, once and for all here, an argument that otherwise

9

would drag through the courts for the next five or six

10

years under this rule, putting the whole industry into a

11

good deal of uncertainty that we think is unwarranted.

new rule that amends EPA's existing regulatory

definition of the term "stormwater discharge associated

the Ninth Circuit's decision in this case and states

MR. STEWART:

Is it your experience that

No, I think that -- well, I

think this happened more quickly than it usually does,

but I think we intended respect for the Court's

processes, rather than disrespect.
Obviously, it's suboptimal for the new rule

17
18

to be issued the Friday before oral argument; but it

19

would have been even worse, I think, from the standpoint

20

of the parties and the Court's decision-making processes

21

if the rule had been issued a week or two after the

22

Court heard oral argument.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, maybe.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you deal with his

7

points about the ex-fact remedies of attorneys' fees and

8

remediation?

9

Why are -- why are those moot?
MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the question of

10

attorneys' fees, if the Ninth Circuit's decision was

11

vacated on the ground that the case would become moot,

12

attorneys' fee are available under the Clean Water Act

13

and citizen suits only to prevailing or substantially

14

prevailing parties.

15

Respondent could make a claim to be a prevailing or

16

substantially prevailing party when, at the end of the

17

day, it got no relief.

18

And I don't see any way that

Now, with respect to questions of

19

remediation and, particularly, of civil penalties, the

20

Court, in Steel Company and Laidlaw, addressed the

21

circumstances under which civil penalties would -- could

22

and could not be awarded in citizen suits.

23

Court in Steel Company said that, in citizen suits, a

24

citizen plaintiff lacks standing to seek civil penalties

25

as a remedy for past violations because the citizen
21
Alderson Reporting Company

And the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

derives no benefit from payment of the penalties into

2

the treasury.

3

In Laidlaw, the Court held that, where there

4

is a prospect of recurring violations or ongoing

5

violations, the citizen plaintiff does have standing to

6

seek civil penalties as a deterrent to future

7

illegality.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do you -- are you

saying that the private companies would not be liable

10

for civil penalties, even though the alleged violation

11

was ongoing at the time of the district court

12

litigation?

13

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

That even

14

if -- if, by the time the -- the suit was wound up,

15

there was no prospect of an ongoing or future violation

16

because EPA had amended the rule to make clear that the

17

conduct was lawful, there would be no future illegally

18

to deter.

19

And then there -­

just for a moment?

EPA made clear that the conduct was

not unlawful.

they have issued a new regulation doesn't mean that the

Now, I know you've taken the position that

The fact that

it was not, but you've got a court of appeals decision

MR. STEWART:

That's correct.

And if we

complicated question whether that award should be

award.

10

But the district court ruled in the
There was never any civil penalty

And so if -- if the question is can the

11

district court, at some future stage of this case, enter

12

a civil penalty award, under Laidlaw, the only

13

justification for that in a citizen suit would be to

14

deter illegal conduct that might be thought to be

15

possible after the civil penalty award was issued and -­

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That -- that would

17

have to be based on the assumption that the Ninth

18

Circuit decision was wrong.

19

MR. STEWART:

It would not have to be based

20

on the assumption that the Ninth Circuit decision was

21

wrong at the time that it was entered; that is, even if

22

EPA had done something that was explicitly characterized

23

as a change in the law, if EPA had issued a rule-making

24

that said, what Petitioners had been doing was unlawful

25

up to this point, but we've decided that it shouldn't be
23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unlawful, and, therefore, we're amending the rule to

2

make it legal, if EPA had done that, there would still

3

be no prospect of future illegality, assuming that the

4

rule is taken to be valid.

5

And, therefore, although in an EPA

6

enforcement action, there might be a possibility of

7

getting monetary awards for past misconduct because

8

that's something the government can do, the citizen's

9

only stake in the matter would be to deter future

10
11

illegalities.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

What if -- what if the rule

12

is held invalid?

13

that question until this rule is challenged, and there

14

is ultimately a -- I'm sure it will be challenged

15

because their position is that the -- this rule

contradicts the statute.

I mean, we don't know the answer to

MR. STEWART:

So how does that factor in to

It certainly is possible that

19

the rule will be challenged, but, as -- as Petitioners

20

have emphasized in their brief, and we agree, the proper

21

forum for adjudicating challenges to the validity of an

22

EPA regulation is through a suit brought against EPA

23

based on the administrative record; that is, a citizen

suit against the petitioners -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I understand that, but my

Alderson Reporting Company

point is, until that suit is -- is concluded, you don't

2

know whether there is a possibility of future violation

3

or not, do you?

4

MR. STEWART:

You don't know.

But I think,

5

at this point, the prospect that the EPA rule would be

6

both challenged and vacated is sufficiently speculative

7

that it would be out of keeping with general principles

8

of mootness for the Court to go on to decide the

9

question of what the old rule meant.

And really -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is what you said true also

of the remediation piece of this?

13

this point, even if we understand this as a change in

Would they also not be entitled to any kind of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I'm having

trouble seeing how we can dismiss it as moot when there

would remain pending claims for civil penalties and

injunctive relief, which you've already said you want to

24

take a closer look at, and attorneys' fees.

25

Now, you seem fairly confident that they'll
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

lose on those, but you felt pretty confident that you'd

2

win on this.

3

MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the one piece

4

that we would want to take a closer look at is the

5

specific question of remediation for past harm; that is,

6

concrete steps on the ground to undo the results of past

7

discharges.

8
9

The -- the other two pieces of it -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

It seems strange that you

would -- that there would be an order of remediation to

10

undo the results of past discharges when, at this point,

11

the law going forward is, go ahead and discharge.

12

MR. STEWART:

I think that's correct, that,

13

as I say, we haven't -- we haven't specifically focused

14

on this question; but my instinct is that an order of

15

remediation would be an aspect of prospective injunctive

16

relief that would be governed by the general rule that

17

injunctive relief is to be determined under the law at

18

the time of the Court's decisions.

19

But with respect to the other two elements

20

of relief, I think those can be easily dealt with as a

21

matter of law; that is, to the extent that they are

22

seeking an injunction ordering that no further

23

discharges occur without a permit, then clearly, the

24

propriety of that sort of injunction would be determined

25

under the new rule, and it wouldn't be available.
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And I think Laidlaw is clear that the only

2

basis that a citizen has for seeking civil penalties is

3

to deter future violations, not to punish prior

4

violations.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is this something

6

that -- in terms of mootness, we should evaluate under

7

the voluntary cessation doctrine?

8

MR. STEWART:

No, I don't believe so

9

because, here, the basis for mootness is not that the -­

10

the defendants in the suit have promised to change their

11

ways; it is that the EPA has issued a new regulation to

12

make clear -­

13
14
15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The EPA has changed

its ways.
MR. STEWART:

Well, EPA is -- EPA is not the

16

defendant in the case; so, even if this were viewed as a

17

change in ways, it wouldn't be voluntary cessation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22

25

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It seems to me, in light of the recent
events, that the most appropriate course for this Court
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is to just simply dismiss this case as improvidently

2

granted.

3

If this Court had reached its -- had gotten

4

a cert petition under the circumstances present right

5

now, it seems to me there'd be three very strong reasons

6

simply just to deny the petition.

7

First of all, because EPA, in its rulemaking

8

on Friday afternoon, itself says that the Ninth Circuit

9

decision has -- cancels out any impact of the Ninth

10

Circuit decision on the ground, moving forward.

11

Second of all, the case is interlocutory in

posture.

15

wants to make -- which I'll explain why in a moment we

16

17

Ninth Circuit.

Remember, we are just on a reversal of a

15

I was just going to

say the case is not going to be over if we dismiss.

11

13

Well, the case is

MR. FISHER:

But that's my point, yes.

And -- but I want to make one thing very clear.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but, in other

17

words, it goes -- under your view, it would go back to

18

the district court; the district court would try all

19

this.

20

law of the case is, if -- if the opinion stands.

21
22
23

And, as the Chief Justice says, we know what the

MR. FISHER:

Well, the law of the case would

be -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and so isn't -­

24

isn't it fairly clear, well, we know that the district

25

court must do under the court of appeals' decision?
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FISHER:

All the district court must do

2

under the Ninth Circuit decision is consider this to be

3

a point source, for the reason that Justice Sotomayor

4

mentioned, and that -- the other side has virtually

5

walked away from that argument, anyway.

6

It is pipe, ditch, or channel; it's

7

perfectly obvious we're dealing with point sources here.

8

The only question is whether you have this covered by

9

the stormwater rules, to the extent they are valid.

And

10

that -- the district court or the Ninth Circuit or

11

whoever would consider in the first instance, and that

12

could come back to this Court.

13

But if I might just explain to this Court, I

14

think it will help the conversation if I explain exactly

15

what our case looks like, going forward, because we have

16

and will maintain a claim for forward-looking relief for

17

two reasons.

18

One is, for the reason that was mentioned a

19

couple of times in the -- in the beginning part of the

20

argument, because we contend that the new rule simply

21

violates the statute.

22

citizen suit for a violation of the Clean Water Act

23

itself, which is to say the language that requires EPA

24

to regulate -­

25

And we have a right to bring a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is this a -­

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

MR. FISHER:

-- all discharges associated

with industrial activity.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you're disclaiming

4

that you have to go to the court of appeals; you think

5

you can bring a citizen suit to challenge the validity

6

of the regulation?

7

MR. FISHER:

Well, I wouldn't put it exactly

8

that way, Justice Sotomayor.

What I would say is that

9

we have the power to bring -- or we have the right to

10

bring a citizen suit to enforce the Act.

And if there

11

is a regulation that the other side brings up that says,

12

we are -- supposedly says, we are exempt from having to

13

get permits, our position is that regulation just simply

14

doesn't fall under 1369(b)(1), for the reasons Judge

15

Pryor just found for the Eleventh Circuit.

16

I sent that up as supplemental authority.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

MR. FISHER:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is, A -­
But that -- that is the

20

question, the question of what the statute requires, was

21

not decided below.

22

MR. FISHER:

That's correct, Justice

23

Ginsburg.

The Ninth Circuit had no -- no reason to

24

reach it because the regulations on stormwater, as then

25

written, were absolutely clear, that logging

activities -­

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you -- you're not

urging that we reach it?

4

MR. FISHER:

I think the most prudent thing,

5

as I've said, is for this Court not to reach that, and

6

to let -- as you described, to let a lower court look at

7

it first and to bring it back.

8
9

But if I can finish my question -- or my
answer to Justice Sotomayor, the reason why that

10

regulation doesn't require us to go to court of appeals

11

in the first instance and actually lets us proceed on a

12

citizen suit is because the only two subsections of

13

1369(b)(1) that they have mentioned are subsections (E)

14

and (F).

15

Subsection (F) deals with EPA decisions,

16

quote, "issuing or denying a permit."

17

decision does neither of those things.

18

Well, this

Secondly, it covers EPA actions that set

19

effluent levels or effluent limitations.

20

for the reasons the Eleventh Circuit just held and other

21

courts have held, this doesn't do that either.

22

And, again,

So there is nothing in 1369(b)(1) that

23

stands in our way of bringing a citizen suit to enforce

24

the statute on those terms.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -­
Mr. Fisher, why would you

6

It's at least arguable that you're

Why don't you proceed that way with

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that what -- what

7

we'll do is proceed whatever way we can because our -­

8

you know, either -- either we are supposed to go

9

directly to the Ninth Circuit -- or any court of

10

appeals, or we are not.

11

and if we're not supposed to go to the court of appeals,

12

as we believe a fair reading of the law -- I don't think

13

there is any plain text meaning of the law that could go

14

otherwise -- then we have -- the only way we can do this

15

is through a citizen suit.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17
18

And if we are, then we will;

Do you think that, on your

view of 1369, you can't go to the Ninth Circuit?
MR. FISHER:

Exactly.

And that's what the

19

Eleventh Circuit just held in a case just like this,

20

where there was a regulation at issue that exempted

21

certain discharges from the permitting program.

22

Eleventh Circuit said, case dismissed.

23

24
25

And the

You can't bring

So we have an -- an ongoing claim for a
violation of the statute, which I can't imagine this

Court would want to address in the first instance.

2

We also, it's important to understand, have

3

a second claim.

4

claim, let me describe overall -- just remind the Court

5

what exactly the case is about.

6

as the other side has -- has portrayed many times, all

7

logging roads, all logging roads that may exist in the

8

world -- or the United States.

9

And before I describe that second

The case isn't about,

What the case is about are two very specific

10

kinds of logging roads:

11

themselves by way of pipes, ditches, and channels, only

12

the small subset of logging roads that do that; and

13

second of all, only logging roads used -- being used for

14

active timber harvesting and hauling, not roads that

15

just happen to be sitting in the forest not being used,

16

but only the small subset of logging roads being used

17

for active timber cutting and harvesting.

Well -- well -­
What about the 9 years

Are they being actively used?
35
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. FISHER:

No, Justice Scalia.

And so

2

under this -- the facts of this case, remember, we're on

3

a motion to dismiss, so when Mr. Bishop says 1 or 2

4

weeks out of whatever, we would like to have a record on

5

that because we don't think that's the reality.

6

But what -- what the case -- what we say in

7

our complaint is that they have a contract with the

8

State of Oregon to harvest particular areas and use

9

particular roads to access that timber and to take it

10

out.

11

to use those roads and to maintain their drainage

12

systems.

13

And the -- and the contract actually requires them

And so our claim -- again, just to remind

14

you what our claim is under the statute -- is that that

15

harvesting activity can't be thought of in any other way

16

than industrial in nature and that these roads are

17

associated with that activity.

18

that purpose, and they're indispensable to the activity.

19

They are designed for

Now, we have a second argument.

Even if the

20

Court thought that we couldn't win -- or a -- whatever

21

court looks at this -- thought we couldn't win on the

22

statute, we have a Chevron Step II argument that we will

23

make and have every right to make because if -- and I'll

24

beg this Court's indulgence -- if -- this rule that they

25

have just announced on Friday afternoon is not as clear
36
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

as you might think.

2

So if you start with the language of the

3

rule, which is on page 18, what they have done is they

4

have amended -- they have amended the stormwater rules

5

to -- to provide that the only industrial activities

6

associated with logging are sawmills, which are covered

7

elsewhere, and then these four categories of things:

Rock crushing, gravel washing, log sorting, and log

storage.

And -- and then industry -- industry group 242

So they are saying those are the only
37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

industrial activities that are associated with logging.

2

But that doesn't answer our claim.

3

logging roads themselves are industrial activities.

4

claim is that logging roads are associated with

5

industrial activities.

6

Our claim isn't that

And so we still have a claim that, under

7

that -- even if those are the only four industrial

8

activities -- or, sorry, five, those four things plus

9

sawmills -- we still have a claim that logging roads

10

are, quote, "immediate access roads" to those

11

activities.

12

Our

And the definition of "immediate access

13

roads," which is unchanged by the new regulation, is at

14

Pet. App. 40a -- the Ninth Circuit quoted it, and I

15

think it was described earlier by my friend -- "Roads

16

which are exclusively or primarily dedicated for the use

17

by the industrial facility."

18

So it's still a mystery to us how logging

19

roads are not primarily for use by even sawmills or

20

these other four things.

21

carefully at EPA's new regulation in the preamble, on

22

page 6, about two-thirds of the way down the middle of

23

the page, the only sentence here that EPA gives us, that

24

even suggests a possible response to the argument I just

25

described is the one that begins with the word "unlike."

And, indeed, if you look very

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

They say, "Unlike immediate access roads

2

associated with industrial activities, many logging

3

roads" -- "many logging roads have multiple uses,

4

including recreation and general transportation, and

5

commonly extend over long distance, i.e., may not

6

provide immediate access to an industrial site."

7

So EPA is leaving open our argument.

EPA is

8

saying, well, logging roads that are just generally

9

recreational, et cetera, are not immediate access roads.

10

But our claim -­

this is my point about going through all this -- I can't

imagine why this Court would want to touch all this in

the first instance, particularly without supplemental

25

briefing, but it seems to me to make every sense to let

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if we -- if we

3

dismiss as improvidently granted, are you suggesting

4

that the Ninth Circuit would then be the -- be a court

5

to consider this?

6

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm -- I'm just

8

thinking if we vacate, perhaps another court will

9

consider it, but if we dismiss as improvidently granted,

10

the Ninth Circuit will, quite reasonably, think they are

11

done.

12

MR. FISHER:

No, because we have a forward

13

look at the -- the first thing we'll tell the Ninth

14

Circuit is -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I mean,

16

they're done -- they are done in terms of their

17

interpretation of the regulation and the applicable law.

MR. FISHER:

I think only as to the

19

backward-looking regulation, but now, we have -- our

20

complaint -- you know, as a citizen suit does -­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then -- but then

22

why -- why isn't your -- aren't your concerns met if we

MR. FISHER:

Well, I -- I think that gets

2

you very close to the same place, Justice Kennedy.

3

just saying there is no reason to vacate because the

4

Ninth Circuit's point-source holding is so

5

self-evidently right, that I don't know why you'd go to

6

the trouble to do that.

7

forward.

8
9

It makes the case simpler going

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think the -­

the Ninth Circuit had the -- of course, EPA's views

10

before it.

11

I would reconsider my ruling, in light of this new

12

regulation.

13
14
15
16

I don't know, if I'm the Ninth Circuit, why

MR. FISHER:

Do you mean the

backward-looking ruling?
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FISHER:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20
21

I mean the ruling in

before us today.
MR. FISHER:

Well, I don't know that they

would reconsider that -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. FISHER:

No.

-- but the -- but the main

24

event going forward is the new rule because the citizen

25

suit seeks cessation of ongoing violations of the Act,
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and that remains the core of our lawsuit, which is

2

still seeking damages -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's the -- but

4

that's the whole point, which is if you go back what's

5

the value of the backward-looking construction, if what

6

you're seeking is injunctive relief that has to be based

7

on the new rule?

8
9

MR. FISHER:
Justice Sotomayor.

It doesn't matter very much,

There is two ways in which it might

10

matter a little bit.

11

claim for any kind of civil penalties or remediation,

12

the backward-looking thing would matter.

13

decide whether we want to do that.

14

One is, if we want to press a

We have to

The second way it would matter would be it

15

would provide a helpful baseline for judging the new

16

rule in the totality of EPA action, which brings me to

17

my -- which brings me back to the argument I was

18

describing, which would be our Chevron Step II argument,

19

that EPA has simply either left this argument open -- I

20

still -- it is still a mystery to us what EPA thinks

21

about our real argument, which is that active hauling

22

logging roads, when they are being used for active

23

harvesting and hauling, are subject to the Act because

24

they are plainly associated with industrial activity.

25

And if EPA later on came out and said, no,
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no, no, we mean to exclude that, too, then we

2

respectfully submit, EPA would still have a lot of

3

explaining to do.

4

First of all, we would very much wonder why

5

log sorting, log storage, gravel washing, and rock

6

crushing are industrial activities, but mechanized

7

timber harvesting with 20-ton pieces of machinery is

8

not.

9

We'd also wonder why this stuff isn't

10

industrial activity, where construction activity,

11

landfill operations, surface mining operations that have

12

all the same attributes of being done out in the field,

13

extraction of resources, heavy machinery, et cetera,

14

are, as the EPA itself admits, industrial activity; but,

15

somehow -- somehow, logging, which has all the same

16

attributes, isn't.

17

And so that's what our claim is going

18

forward.

19

because I'm not sure this Court wants to get into all of

20

this stuff yet; but what I am telling this Court is,

21

there is no basis whatsoever to find this case is

22

moot -- or I don't think this Court would want to touch

23

any of the arguments being made here without further

24

briefing, at least as to the new rule.

25

Now, I'm not asking this Court to address that

We do think it's absolutely clear we are
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

dealing with point sources.

2

clear, based on the language of -- of 1369(b)(1), that

3

there just can't be any way that there is a

4

jurisdictional, or whatever other kind of problem you

5

want to label it, with us bringing a claim based on the

6

statute itself.

7

fall into those.

8
9

We do think it's absolutely

The new regulation just simply doesn't

So if this Court dismisses the case, we'll
go to the Ninth Circuit and tell them, we want to go

10

forward for -- for the following reasons.

11

anybody is unhappy with what happens in the Ninth

12

Circuit, obviously, we can file or they can file

13

petitions for -- for cert in this Court.

14

And if

Let me just say one last thing to this Court

15

about what we view as really the arbitrary and

16

capricious nature of EPA's new rule and why you

17

shouldn't touch it.

18

Remember, I said -- and this is in EPA's

19

regulations themselves -- that construction activity -­

20

any construction activity in a site five acres or more

21

is industrial activity.

22

So if a developer buys a parcel of forested

23

land and wants to build a subdivision there and the

24

first thing the developer does is punch in some roads

25

and drainage systems and cut some trees down to make
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

room for the houses, that is covered by the EPA's

2

stormwater rules; but, if a logging company does

3

precisely the same thing, EPA's position seems to be

4

it's not covered.

5

And not only is it not covered if it happens

6

on public land, but I think at least the implication of

7

my friend's position is that, for logging companies, of

8

which there are many in the northwest, that own their

9

own land -- own their own giant pieces of forest land,

10

and that are not open to the public, that are not open

11

to hunters, that are not open to recreation, but they

12

have their own logging roads on their own private lands

13

that nobody can use, but them, I still think his

14

position is that's not covered by the Act.

15

And finally, EPA has one other thing that I

16

want to point out to the Court about this new rule.

17

it's, again, got our heads -- it gets our heads

18

scratching as to what EPA is really doing here.

19

And

EPA says twice in the preamble to their new

20

rule, once on page 7 and also on page 12, that it,

21

quote, "retains the authority to designate at least some

22

logging roads as covered by its so-called point -- Phase

23

II system."

24
25

What the Phase II system is, is under
Section 1342(p), which is the stormwater amendments to
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the Act, it's the category of point source discharges

2

that EPA says are not a covered -- are not industrial

3

activity -- associated industrial activity, but we,

4

nonetheless, are going to require certain things of

5

them.

6

This is the critical point.

EPA says this

7

twice.

Well, the only authority EPA would have to

8

regulate any logging roads -- discharges from logging

9

roads, is if they are point sources because you don't

10

get into the Phase II program, you don't get into the

11

stormwater amendments, unless you have a point source.

12

If it's a non-point source, then, as my

13

friend has pointed out quite at length in his brief,

14

it's entirely up to the States, and EPA has -- has

15

nothing to say about it.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm looking at page 7, and

17

it doesn't say the authority to designate additional

18

roads.

It says additional stormwater discharges.

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

Right.
That could be stormwater

discharges that have nothing to do with logging.

22

MR. FISHER:

I think if that's all we had,

23

Justice Scalia, it might be a little bit ambiguous,

24

although, of course, this is in the context of logging

25

the roads.
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But look at page 12.

And this is the

2

final -- this is the very end of -- of the preamble.

3

The last sentence, "EPA believes that stormwater

4

discharges from forest roads, including logging roads,

5

should be evaluated under Section 402(p)(6)."

6

The only authority EPA has for -- for doing

7

that is if they -- if they are point sources; whereas

8

EPA has filed a brief in this case that says that they

9

are, at least some of them, are not.

I don't know if

10

it's walking away from that or is planning on walking

11

away from that.

12

But, again, there is a variety of questions,

13

I think, that EPA should have to address and answer --

14

Did you have one?

15

address and answer before any court does anything based

16

on this new rule.

17

I'm sorry -- that EPA should have to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you were

18

challenging the new rule, you would have EPA as your

19

adversary.

20

have Decker on one side and you on the other, and the

21

EPA is not in the lawsuit.

22

The format of this case now is we have -- we

MR. FISHER:

Well, EPA, of course, is an

23

amicus, Justice Ginsburg, and EPA has an ongoing right

24

to intervene in any citizen suit.

25

right.

That's a statutory

And there's a statutory notice that any
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

plaintiff in a citizen suit is required to provide to

2

EPA, which we did provide to EPA.

3

right to intervene in the case at any point as a party.

And so EPA has every

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

right to intervene and dismiss the action?

6

MR. FISHER:

Does that include a

Well, I think that EPA has a

7

right to intervene and make an argument that the case is

8

moot or any other substantive argument they would like

9

to make back in the Ninth Circuit.

And of course,

10

mootness, if it's genuinely moot, which, for all of

11

these reasons, we think, of course, it's not, but

12

mootness is an Article III principle that an amicus

13

could raise, and a court would be bound to consider on

14

its own.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, they -- they are just

16

intervening.

It's -- it's not like what happens in

17

the -- in the suits for fraud against the government,

18

where they take over the litigation.

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

21

Right.
They don't take it over.

They just intervene.

22

MR. FISHER:

I think that's what would

23

happen.

You could ask them how they would like to

24

proceed, but I assume that's how it would happen, and I

25

assume the defendants in the case would remain the same.

21

position that collected forest road runoff is not point

source and, since 1980, that logging is not industrial

23

activity, and these roads are not associated with

24

industrial activity.

deal of -- of values, particularly since, as Mr. Fisher

relief -- backward-looking relief, but also prospective
