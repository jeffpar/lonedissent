v. The Natural Resources Defense Council.

Mr. Coates.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. COATES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

In this case, the Ninth Circuit held that a

12

discharge from a point source under the Clean Water Act

13

occurred in the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers,

14

based upon the fact that water moved from channelized

15

portions of the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers into

16

what it termed, quote, "naturally occurring portions of

17

those rivers."

18

The court emphasized, in fact, that the

19

discharge occurred because it moved through the concrete

20

portions.

21

at the cert appendix at 44, it was, "again discharged to

22

the rivers," and the "again" meaning that it was

23

prior -- at prior time, it was in the rivers.

24
25

And in the words of the court itself, found

This is completely contrary to the Court's
decision in Miccosukee Tribe, where the Court held that
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

there cannot be a discharge for purposes of the NPDES

2

permit program and the Clean Water Act, based upon the

3

mere transfer of water within a single body of water.

4

All the parties to this case agree that is

5

the correct rule.

Virtually all the amici agree that is

6

the correct rule.

And it's our view that that is

7

dispositive of this case.

8

before this Court from the Ninth Circuit, and it

9

dictates --

10

It is the only live issue

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why don't we just

11

remand and let it sort it out under the right

12

understanding of the legal rule?

13

what the government is saying, with an added twist

14

because it thinks there is another legal question that I

15

think the Ninth Circuit has answered, but we could go

16

back and forth on it.

17

MR. COATES:

Correct.

Which is basically

At minimum, a

18

reversal is -- is warranted, without a doubt, but I

19

think given the record in this case is abundantly clear

20

about what the claims were before the Ninth Circuit and

21

what's going on with these monitoring stations.

22

I mean, these monitoring stations are

23

clearly within the rivers themselves.

There is just no

24

dispute about that.

25

like I said, the language of the opinion

Even the Ninth Circuit's opinion,

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

suggests that --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. COATES:

Everybody agrees.

Correct.

And the reason why I

4

don't think there is an open remand is because there is

5

nothing further in the record, really, to argue about.

6

At minimum, of course, we would prefer

7

reversal, and it would take an open remand.

But I

8

think, given the record in this case, the only live

9

claim before the Ninth Circuit was this discharge theory

10

when they found it in the middle of rivers; and, that

11

being resolved against the Respondents, there is no

12

other live issue.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it seems to me

14

that they present a very direct syllogism.

15

permit that sets these monitoring stations where they

16

are.

17

violated your permit.

18

You have a

The monitoring stations show exceedances, you have
What -- what's wrong with that?

MR. COATES:

Well, because the nature of the

19

monitoring here -- for example, when you look at the

20

permitting question, it doesn't say the monitoring of

21

any permittee.

22

about the mass emissions monitoring stations, it talks

23

about measuring discharges and compliance from the MS4,

24

not any individual permittee's MS4.

25

If you look at the permit where it talks

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Right.

But I

Official

1

understand the argument to be that that's the problem

2

that your permit imposes on you; in other words, that

3

this is where the monitoring station is supposed to be.

4

What is it monitoring, if not discharges from the MS4,

5

for which you're responsible?

6

The government suggests that there could be

7

different rules about whether you have to show the

8

allocation or if that's your responsibility.

9

MR. COATES:

But itâ€™s the -- Well, I think,

10

again, the -- the rules say that you look at the permit's

11

terms to interpret it.

12

And the Ninth Circuit did look at the

13

permit's terms.

14

argument, and it noted that there are several factors in

15

the permit that suggest that it didn't relieve the

16

Respondents of the obligation of having to show an

17

actual discharge of water --

18

I mean, it -- it dealt with this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you don't --

19

you don't question that there was an actual discharge.

20

The storm sewer system in Los Angeles hasn't been shut

21

down, right?

22

MR. COATES:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24
25

Correct.

But, again -So there are

discharges, right?
MR. COATES:

But not discharges of
6

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

pollutants, and that's what's reported.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You don't dispute

3

that there was at least some small amount of pollutant,

4

even below the -- the permit level, from your point

5

sources, do you?

6
7
8
9

MR. COATES:

Well, we don't know that.

But

the -- but the point I want to make -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm asking you

whether -- I mean, isn't it -- doesn't common sense

10

suggest -- you have asked in your permit for a limit on

11

how much of a --

12

MR. COATES:

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

Sure.

pollutant you can discharge.

15

MR. COATES:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

-- particular

But, again -You wouldn't do

that, unless you expected to discharge some.
MR. COATES:

You might --

You might do it

19

sometimes, you might do it others, you might do it in

20

concentrations that would cause or contribute to the

21

exceedances; but you still have to have a discharge that

22

causes or contributes to the exceedances.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, why did you

24

put the monitoring sources where they are, if that

25

wasn't what was going to measure your compliance with
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the permit?

2

MR. COATES:

Because you're required, in

3

a -- in a system-wide permit like this, to suggest -- to

4

propose monitoring which is subject to the approval of

5

the regulatory agency.

6

monitoring of what?

7

permittee's discharge.

8

that.

9

to that effect.

10

And it's a question of

Not monitoring of any individual
In fact, it's not designed for

We even presented evidence in the district court

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the government

11

says that that question -- you're saying, I understand,

12

there are other discharges -- well, you're by far the

13

dominant discharger, but I understand there are others,

14

and they may contribute as well to what the monitoring

15

station says.

16

But the government's position is that, well,

17

that's how you wrote the permit without any allocation;

18

and that whatever allocation issues you have may be

19

between you and the other dischargers, but that doesn't

20

affect the showing of liability.

21

MR. COATES:

Well, except for the fact that

22

the permit terms themselves say that each permittee is

23

only responsible for its own discharge.

24

permit in the general fashion that the Respondents wish,

25

then -- then you're not responsible only for your own
8
Alderson Reporting Company

If you read the

Official

1

discharge.

2

It's essentially you're in immediately and

3

responsible for all of them, until you prove otherwise.

4

And that's just not how the permit reads.

5
6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
know we've got the permit.

7
8

MR. COATES:

Where is that?

Where does it read that way?

Let's see.

At the Joint

Appendix, page 93, G, 4.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
MR. COATES:

11

Suppose that the district

16

has 85 percent of the water by volume that's put into

17

18

Does that make it an easier case for the challengers?

19

Or is that just irrelevant?

20

MR. COATES:

It's just irrelevant, unless

21

you show that, in that bulk of water, there is a higher

22

concentration of pollutants.

23

You could have a major discharger that

24

undertakes more vigorous pollution controls than other

25

smaller discharges.

It doesn't necessarily show that
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you're adding more pollutants, necessarily, or how those

2

pollutants contribute to exceedances measured at the

3

mass emissions monitoring stations.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I have one different

5

question.

6

It's just for me to understand that.

7

This is hypothetical.

It's not in the case.

Suppose you have the river, and part of it

8

is a concrete bank, and then there's a more natural

9

bedding and then another concrete bank.
And when the -- in the dry season, they fix

10
11

the concrete bank, but they use bad concrete.

12

of pollutants are coming out of the concrete, but it is

13

in the river.

14
15

And a lot

Is that a discharge under this statute?

MR. COATES:

I don't believe so.

Although,

I could --

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. COATES:

Would there be any --

-- imagine circumstances where

18

you create an outfall unintentionally by -- by

19

funneling.

20

natural erosion of turbidity or whatever into the river.

21

I don't believe that would necessarily be a point

22

source.

I mean, I think you're talking about just

23

It might be a non-point source pollution,

24

but I don't believe that would necessarily be a point

25

source if it's just inadvertently -- you know,
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deteriorating in the river.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's -- that's a

3

separate provision of the statute, nonpoint source

4

pollutions.

5

MR. COATES:

Well, it doesn't sound like --

6

7

you know, like, enclosed conveyance that -- that

8

discharges --

9
10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
case.

11
12

Well, that's not in this

MR. COATES:

Yes, that's not in this case.

But I --

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

background question for you.
MR. COATES:

15

It was just a background,

Yes, but I think that that --

16

that probably wouldn't be a discharge from a point

17

source.

18
19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Coates, I am -- I am

still perplexed.

20

MR. COATES:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You say -- and it seems to

22

be correct, that each -- each alleged polluter is only

23

responsible for his own pollution.

24

that these monitors are so situated that it is

25

impossible to tell from the monitor who is responsible
11
Alderson Reporting Company

But you also say

Official

1

for the pollution; is that right?

2
3

MR. COATES:

I think that -- I think that is

right, but you look for the --

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. COATES:

So whose fault is that?

Well, the reason why -- the

6

reason why that that's there is to measure, essentially,

7

the health of these rivers so that you can fine-tune the

8

MS4 permit -- the systemwide permit, and so that you can

9

gauge general water quality standards, and if necessary,

10

you can fine-tune it to try and measure individual

11

permittees.

12

And we note that there is a renewed permit.

13

It still has the monitoring stations in it, so under the

14

Ninth Circuit's decision, we would still be discharging

15

at those monitoring stations.

16

outfall monitoring at representative outfalls for

17

individual permittees to do precisely that kind of

18

correlation that we are talking about.

19
20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But it does provide for

What -- what it is -- what

is it that provides for that?

21

MR. COATES:

There is a renewed permit.

The

22

permits are renewed every 5 years.

This is -- we are on

23

the third permit now; this is the fourth; it's gone 10

24

years.

25

station.

The renewed permit continues the mass emission
So, as I mentioned, we are still discharging
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in middle of the river, as far as the Ninth Circuit is

2

concerned.

3

But it does have provisions for additional

4

monitoring near outfalls, along the banks of the rivers,

5

for various permittees, so that, in the future, you

6

could look at that testing and go, boy, your outfall is

7

producing X, Y, and Z.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So this was a regulatory

void?

10

MR. COATES:

This was a --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

A regulatory void that

12

these -- that there was no requirement previously that

13

you monitor the outfalls?

14
15

MR. COATES:

Monitoring, correct, that there

be specific outfall monitoring.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a regulatory -So how do you -- how do

17

you envision this permit was -- by the way, just one

18

side question and then on to this one.

19

I thought the Ninth Circuit basically

20

endorsed your view that, under the permit, you're not --

21

you're only responsible for your own pollution.

22

MR. COATES:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

That is correct.
So it has resolved this

issue?
MR. COATES:

It has resolved this issue.
13

Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that's

why I ask why remand and why you're saying why remand.

3

MR. COATES:

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

All right.

Yes.
But putting that aside,

how do you think the system was supposed to work before?

6

MR. COATES:

Well --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did you have any

8

obligation, once you saw the excess pollutants, to start

9

the reiteration process, to try to figure out who was

10

the cause of this?

11

MR. COATES:

Well, if they attribute a -- a

12

violation to a particular permittee -- for example, the

13

district court noted and the Ninth Circuit re-emphasized

14

it that you could at least, if you wanted to try and hook

15

it to a single permittee, you could at least try and

16

sample at an outfall for that permittee and then provide

17

evidence that that contributed to exceedances.

18
19

They didn't do that here, in the lower
court.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

could have done that here?

22

MR. COATES:

23

that here.

24

Ninth Circuit.

25

You mean the Respondents

The Respondents could have done

They did not argue that they did that in the
They abandoned that -- that contention.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
14
Alderson Reporting Company

So what -- what

Official

1

percentage of discharges come from you, as opposed to

2

the other members of the MS4 --

3

MR. COATES:

We have -- we have the most

4

infrastructure.

I don't know the specific percentage,

5

but bear in mind that there are 1,400 other entities

6

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. COATES:

9

total water volume.

Give me an estimate.

You know, I can't in terms of

But we are -- we are the largest

10

player in that portion of the system.

11

downplay that.

12

I'm not going to

What I'm saying is that there is no

13

necessary correlation between that and, ipso facto,

14

you're the one causing the exceedances at the monitoring

15

stations; that, again, there has to be something

16

traceable to our discharge that contributes to those

17

exceedances.

18
19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

into these discharges, besides the rainwater runoff?

20

MR. COATES:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

MR. COATES:

23
24
25

What -- what goes

Here, it's just stormwater.
Okay.

I mean, a municipal separate

storm sewer system -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So your -- your

hypothesis is, in some of these minority dischargers,
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that, for some reason, their rainwater would have a

2

different amount of pollutants than your rainwater?

3

MR. COATES:

Well, they could -- they could

4

very well have storm discharge different -- Yes, there

5

are other discharges upstream from -- there are

6

industrial sites that discharge water into the L.A.

7

River, so -- no, absolutely.

8

you know, a large jurisdiction, we may be more proactive

9

in terms of doing pollution control as well.

Absolutely.

And again --

There is just no automatic correlation to

10
11

that.

And I think, as the district court said -- you

12

know, it's not so much to ask to at least sample at one

13

outfall to try and show that kind of correlation, so you

14

can show exceedances at the margin.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

I'm sorry, you mean --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Justice Kennedy.

17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY: Circuit's error -- was the
Ninth Circuit's error here a factual one, because it was

19

based on the location of the stations?

20

one because it misinterpreted our Miccosukee case?

21

MR. COATES:

Or was it a legal

It -- it's a legal one.

I

22

don't believe it's a factual mistake, for a couple of

23

reasons.

24

in the cert appendix at 44, where it talks about the

25

water, again, discharged to the river, suggests that

One, the language that -- that I cited, that's

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that water was in the river, and now, it's moving

2

through our concrete channels and it's, again,

3

discharged into the river.

4

draws is that there is something different because the

5

MS4 is an intrastate manmade construction, as opposed to

6

a naturally occurring river, which talks about the

7

distinction being made in that regard.

8
9

Its distinction that it

And finally, the record is just abundantly
clear on where these monitoring stations are.

The

10

opinion itself at cert appendix, page 18, footnote 4,

11

cites our website as the location of the monitoring --

12

for the location of the monitoring stations.

13

website clearly says they are within the Los Angeles and

14

San Gabriel Rivers.

15

the Respondents' brief in the lower court, specifically

16

said the same thing.

And, in fact, appellant's brief --

17

And the --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

polluters upstream.

20

upstream --

You just said there were

Are those industrial polluters

21

MR. COATES:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

And that

There are -- there are --- or industrial

facilities, are they within your MS4?

24

MR. COATES:

25

They are not.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

They have

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what you're saying

2

is that there are outfalls from different people into

3

the same river.

4

MR. COATES:

Correct.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.

All right.

So we don't

6

know whether the outfall is from your MS4 or from some

7

other source?

8
9
10

MR. COATES:

Correct, because they are all

upstream of -- of the monitoring station.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So you say they have

11

two remedies, that the NRDC, if they think you are

12

polluting, could have done -- could do two things.

13

they could go and get some expert to try to get a sample

14

or to make an estimate, based on what he knows about the

15

industrial sites that it's actually your storm drains

16

that are polluting.

17

say they didn't do it.

18

Okay.

One,

That's one thing they could do; you

The second thing they could do is

19

they go to the permitting authority, and they could say,

20

will you please ask the L.A. County to monitor the

21

actual storm drains when they come in, a sample thereof.

22

And you're saying they could have done that, but they

23

don't have to now because, now, that is a requirement.

I thought there was a suggestion in the

MR. COATES:

We have -- in the lower courts,

the district personnel refer to the channelized portion

16

as part of our MS4 because it's all flood control to us.

17

However, we have never said it's all the same for

18

purposes of a discharge.

19

that, that, for a discharge from a point source, an

20

outfall, not the monitoring stations -- in fact, in the

21

district court, plaintiff somewhat argued that theory,

22

the monitoring stations, when you're MS4, they're

23

exceedances; ergo, exceedances in your MS4.

24
25

We've been very careful about

And we pointed out, under Miccosukee, there
is no discharge of water.

There's no discharge because

Alderson Reporting Company

it's merely transferring water as water moves past the

2

monitoring stations.

3

And then --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was the purpose of

4

having the monitoring station if nothing can be done?

5

And are -- the monitoring shows, yes, there is a lot of

6

pollutants in there, and we know that at least some of

7

them have to be ascribed to the district.

8

unless you -- you show the outflow, that it comes from

9

there, no liability.

But you say,

Why shouldn't it be that, given there is

10
11

going to be a contribution that the district is making,

12

that the district should have the burden of showing, no,

13

there are all these other ones out there, so our

14

percentage is X, not the whole thing?
MR. COATES:

15

Well, again, the -- the Water

16

Act makes you responsible for a discharge in violation

17

of permit terms, so you have to have a discharge by the

18

permittee.

The regional board -- as I said, it's part

8

this reason.

9

There have been three permits over the
And we have a fourth permit, and it

I note that -- the biggest dispute we seem

10

to have on this monitoring issue -- and -- and it's one

11

that I think the discussion we are having bears out, is

12

that it is not a straightforward issue; that when you

13

look at the statute itself, the Statute 1342(p)(3)

14

distinguishes between industrial stormwater dischargers

15

and municipal stormwater discharges.

16

Now, I think it is worth looking at that

17

provision because, if you look at (a), and that talks

18

about industrial dischargers, it says they have to meet

19

every requirement of this provision.

20

1342(a), it includes everything, including the

21

monitoring requirements of 33 U.S.C. 1318.

22

And if you go to

But if you look at 1342(p)(3), subdivision

23

(B), which talks about municipal stormwater, you do not

24

see that language.

25

with every other provision of this section.

You do not see that "must comply"

22
Alderson Reporting Company

It doesn't

Official

1

say that.

2

It only has, essentially, three

3

requirements, which is these permits can be granted on a

4

system-wide or jurisdiction-wide basis, you have to only

5

allow stormwater, and that the -- must provide to try

6

and manage pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.

7

And that's the sum total of it.

8
9

So I don't think you can assume that these
are identical monitoring requirements.

It's, at the

10

very least, a complex question.

I think it's one that

11

would have behooved the Court to be able to obtain more

12

amicus assistance on.

13

this was raised to this Court, that this was a proper

14

issue for a cross-petition.

And part of it is the way that

And the only justification I've seen for

15
16

this is I saw a letter come to the Court advising it of

17

two cases, I think, LeTulle v. Scofield -- I don't know

if it's LeTulle or LeTulle -- and Ryerson v. United

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH,

18
19
20
21

Thank you, counsel.

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. SHAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The answer to the question presented in this

22

case is both straightforward and undisputed.

23

Court's decision in Miccosukee, no addition, and thus,

24

no discharge of pollutant occurs, when water flows from

25

a channelized portion of a river to a downstream portion
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Under this

Official

1

of that same river.

2

Because the monitoring stations at issue are

3

actually located within the rivers themselves, the court

4

of appeals erred in concluding that a discharge of

5

pollutants occurred when, quote, "the still-polluted

6

stormwater flowed out of the concrete channels where the

7

monitoring stations are located, through an outfall and

8

into the navigable waterways."

9

And because the court of appeals rested its

10

liability determination on that erroneous premise, the

11

judgment should be vacated and the case remanded to the

12

court of appeals.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shah, what about the

14

problem that one of the amici brought up concerning

15

dredged material?

16

applies, then when there's a dredging operation and the

17

material is redeposited back into the same water, then

18

that would also -- there would be no responsibility

19

based on that.

20

Said that if we just say Miccosukee

MR. SHAH:

Right.

Your Honor, I think -- I

21

think the one amicus that does raise that issue raises

22

it limited to -- the biggest counterexample they raise

23

is the one that you raise about Section 404 permits for

24

dredged and fill material.

25

different in kind.

Those permits are just very

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Section 404 applies to dredged and fill

2

material, which almost, by definition, is going to be

3

coming from the source itself.

4

Miccosukee line of decision just doesn't apply to that

5

permitting regime, which -- which is a very different

6

sort of permitting regime than we have at issue here.

7

And in any event, I think it's far beyond

And so we think that the

8

the question presented in this case, the Miccosukee

9

rule.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Counsel, tell me why

11

remand?

12

I'm wrong, okay -- that the district court rejected

13

Respondents' argument that the mere monitoring excesses

14

created liability.

15

the terms of the permit and make the permittee

16

responsible only for their excess discharges, and you

17

haven't shown us any evidence that does that.

18

I thought -- and correct me at whatever step

What it said is you have to follow

The Ninth Circuit agreed that the permittee

19

is only liable for its own discharges.

It held the

20

permittee liable because it believed that the discharges

21

were within their source -- within their outflow.

22

what are we remanding for?

23

whether the -- the -- the monitoring stations

24

automatically create liability has been answered in the

25

negative by both courts.

So

The legal question of

2

MR. SHAH:

Justice Sotomayor, I agree with

your reading of -- of both opinions below.

3

I think what we're asking for is the Court

4

to do what it normally does when it vacates an erroneous

5

part of a judgment and sends it back, that is, leave it

6

open to the court of appeals, to address any issues

7

consistent with this Court's opinion.

8

We think it's conceivable that the Ninth

9

Circuit might approach the permit construction issue

10

differently, once it's corrected of the

11

misimpressions --

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. SHAH:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15
16

How would it --

-- that it had before it.
-- what could it do

differently?
MR. SHAH:

I think, in particular, the Ninth

17

Circuit construed this permit on the understanding that

18

there was a discharge of polluted water after it flowed

19

past the monitoring station and said that the district

20

could be liable, based simply on the exceedance measured

21

by the mass emission station alone.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How does that change the

23

answer to the legal question that the permittee -- both

24

courts have said the permittee is only liable for their

25

own discharges.

And unless this proves that they
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discharged -- they, themselves, discharged, which it

2

can't because it's in the river and not within the

3

source --

4

MR. SHAH:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6
7

Well, it --- how can that, alone,

establish liability?
MR. SHAH:

Well, again, I think the Ninth

8

Circuit predicated its permit interpretation on the

9

understanding that there would be at least some way to

10

hold a permittee -- in this case, the district -- liable

11

based on the mass emission exceedance alone, and that's

12

because it misapprehended that there would be a

13

discharge of flow of the polluted water.

14

It could be, and it may not be.

We don't

15

know until it gets back to the Ninth Circuit.

16

that the Ninth Circuit would reject the view that you

17

could have a permit that sets up a permitting regime

18

that does not allow a plaintiff to sue any particular

19

permittee, unless it has evidence beyond that provided

20

by the monitoring regime.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It may be

So -- so -- so what follows

22

from that; that the district is liable because it's a

23

lousy permit?

24

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, if --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I do not see how this

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

court -- how the -- how the court of appeals is going to

2

be able to do anything different, other than say there's

3

no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another

4

fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is

5

something I worry about.

6

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, we think that

7

this permit -- again, the terms of this permit are both

8

complex and ambiguous.

9

should be written this way.

We do not think that permits
We think permits that

10

provide for water quality -- for MS4s to adhere to water

11

quality standards based on ambient monitoring should be

12

coupled with either individual --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I -- I agree with that, but

14

how can this permit possibly be interpreted in such a

15

way as to hold a district liable?

16

MR. SHAH:

Well, I think the most

17

persuasive -- and, again, we don't take a firm position

18

on this, but I think the most persuasive argument on the

19

other side would be that, when permit writers issue a

20

permit, they -- they assume that the permitting regime

21

provided in the permit would provide a basis to seek

22

enforcement of that permit.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

24
25

If that were true -They would assume that;

but, if it doesn't, it doesn't.
MR. SHAH:

Well -29

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what do you do if it

doesn't?

3

MR. SHAH:

Well, one could imagine a regime

4

where the permittees, that is, the municipalities who

5

apply for a joint permit, would agree to a shared

6

presumption of liability.

7
8

For example, there are --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They have -- they have not

agreed.

9

MR. SHAH:

Well, again, we don't --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

So you're going to impose a

11

shared thing?

I see no way for the court of appeals to

12

do this in -- in a fashion that will not bring the case

13

right back here, and you'll be asking us to send it back

14

to the same panel.
MR. SHAH:

15

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

16

it's a cert-worthy issue, how to interpret the terms of

17

this specific -- this is a fairly --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

But, anyway, you say that

19

the court held the same thing in two other cases

20

involving two other rivers, and they didn't cross-appeal

21

from that, and so that issue isn't really in front of

22

us.

23

MR. SHAH:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Well, Your Honor -And if they did hold what

you said, then they'd have to reopen the other two
30
Alderson Reporting Company

cases.

2

MR. SHAH:

Right.

You Honor, I think in

3

terms of the cross-petition issue, that is a closed

4

question.

5

because I think there are several other good reasons why

6

this Court should not decide the permit construction

7

issue itself.

8
9

I don't think the Court needs to get near it

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

But if we decide

that they needed file a cross-petition and they didn't,

10

then what's the basis for our remanding, rather than

11

reversing?

12

MR. SHAH:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14
15

Well, Your Honor -It's that issue that what

we have to decide.
MR. SHAH:

remand for disposition of any further issues once a case

comes before this Court.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

7

We do not defend the judgment on the Ninth

Circuit's stated rationale, but on alternative grounds

9

that are properly before this Court.

The compliance

10

monitoring included in the permit determines

11

Petitioner's liability for permit violations as a matter

12

of law, as the Clean Water Act, EPA regulations, and the

13

permit's own terms all require.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, where is the

15

permit's own terms?

Your friend cited JA 93, which says

16

each permittee is responsible only for a discharge for

17

which it is the operator.

18

clearly show the opposite?

19

MR. COLANGELO:

So where does the permit

Your Honor, let me point you

20

to three provisions in the permit that, taken together,

21

compel this result.

22

Appendix, the paragraph numbered D(1).

23

to the individual permittees, and it says, "Each

24

permittee must comply with all of the terms,

25

requirements, and conditions of this order.

The first is page 195 of the Joint

35
Alderson Reporting Company

And this refers

Any

Official

1

violation of this order constitutes a violation of the

2

Clean Water Act, its regulations, and the California

3

Water Code, and is grounds for enforcement action."

4

And that's the first of the three

5

provisions, and it is undisputed here that there are

6

permit violations.

7

permit that Petitioner and its co-permittees chose has

8

demonstrated, since 2003, undisputed permit violations.

9
10

The monitoring included in the

The second provision is page 98 -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wait.

But -- but before

11

you go further, it says each permittee must comply.

12

doesn't say that each permittee shall be responsible or

13

shall be liable.

14

that each permittee is responsible only for a discharge

15

for which it is the operator.

And it's the other provision that says

Well, and what 195 adds is

it says any violation is grounds for enforcement action.
Now, JA 98 talks about exactly this

23

circumstance, when violations are detected at the

24

monitoring stations.

25

says, if exceedances of water quality objectives or

And about halfway down JA 98, it

36
Alderson Reporting Company

1

water quality standards persist -- and that's only

2

measured in one place; that's at the compliance

3

monitoring in the rivers -- notwithstanding

4

implementation of control measures and other

5

requirements of this permit, quote, "the permittee,"

6

individually, "the permittee shall assure compliance

7

with discharge prohibitions and receiving water

8

limitations by complying with the following procedure."

9

It then sets out four steps that each

10

permittee must comply with to bring the MS4 within the

11

permit limits.

12

Now, that is --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the very first

13

step is A, "Upon a determination by either the permittee

14

or the regional board that discharges are causing or

15

contributing to an exceedance of an applicable water

16

quality standard, the permittee shall promptly notify,"

17

et cetera.

18

because of the nature of the monitoring -- monitoring

19

here.

They cannot make such a determination

MR. COLANGELO:

20

That's -- that's incorrect,

21

Your Honor.

The permit compels this result because

there is only one place in the permit that that

JUSTICE BREYER:

But as I read it, and he

4

explained it, I thought that, look, what they're

5

thinking is this:

6

and it's really complicated how you work it out, and we

7

want the agencies to work it out.

8

this monitoring thing is we first determine that there

is an exceedance.

Stormwater is really a big problem,

So the purpose of

Now, once we determine that there is an

10

exceedance, which is the point of this pertinent

12

particular requirement, then we're going to go on to

13

decide who.

with two possible choices.

15

out who, which means you've got to get an expert and

16

monitor it; or let us now have a new permit which

17

will -- will -- you know, which will -- which will put

18

some responsibility on the individuals, because we'll

19

monitor higher up the river.

20

And what we're going to do is leave you
One is you can try to figure

Now, that's a rational way for an agency to

21

proceed and it leaves you with pretty good remedies.

22

And so why -- why are we running all around, trying to

23

work this thing out?

24

deal with it as they described it and say, okay, we're

going to either prove you did it before or at least we

this process is that permit terms are fixed once the

11

Now, the reason we didn't challenge the

alongside the State agency as an intervenor against

Petitioner's challenge.

15

24

enforcement proceeding.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how do -- the

39
Alderson Reporting Company

1

district is a big contributor, but there are other

2

contributors.

3

what is the share that the district would be liable for?

4

So, on your theory, how do we determine

MR. COLANGELO:

Your Honor, the permit

5

includes a blueprint that sorts that out, and it

6

parallels the traditional notion of several liability.

7

Where there are multiple contributors to a single harm,

8

each is responsible for its share --

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

that there is a contributor.

11

these sections, and it seems to me that a reasonable

12

interpretation of this section is that there is a

13

violation if a particular permittee violates.

14

But you still have to show
And I've been through

And what I'm taking away from your argument

15

is that, once there is a violation, all the permittees

16

are liable, and that just can't be.

17

MR. COLANGELO:

It can be, Your Honor, and

18

that's the -- that's the solution that the permit works

out and that the permittees negotiated for in advance.

section.

What's the third section,

I'm waiting breathlessly for your third

You said there were three.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. COLANGELO:

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The third, Your Honor -I've got 195.

40
Alderson Reporting Company

I've got 98.

1

Where is the third one?

2
3

MR. COLANGELO:
109.

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

MR. COLANGELO:

6

The third, Your Honor, is JA

109.
And this parallels a

provision in EPA's regulations.

7

At the very bottom of JA 109, subsection D,

8

it says, "The permittee shall carry out all inspection,

9

surveillance, and monitoring procedures necessary to

10

determine compliance and noncompliance with permit

11

conditions."

12

So the problem with Petitioner's theory is

13

that they are violating this provision of the permit,

14

which is taken virtually verbatim from EPA regulations,

15

which says that the discharger has the responsibility to

16

measure and report its own violations.

17

And stepping back to talk about the Clean

18

Water Act program, generally, and the discharge permit

19

program, generally, no one is entitled to discharge

20

without a permit; a permit fixes terms that must be

21

complied with; and at the heart of the permitting

22

program is self-monitoring and self-reporting of

23

violations.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well --

Looking at

109, it strikes me as a little bit circular to say â€“ to
41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

say they have the responsibility to carry out inspection

2

and surveillance and monitoring to ensure compliance with

3

the permit, and their point is, well, we're not -- we're

4

not not in compliance with the permit because you

5

haven't -- there hasn't been an allocation of the

6

discharges to them.

7

MR. COLANGELO:

Well -- and the problem with

8

that, Your Honor, is that it leads to no liability ever

9

for the discharger, even though it concedes --

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think that

11

might be -- I think that might be right, but that gets

12

back to the question of whether the permit is -- is

13

poorly drafted.

14

MR. COLANGELO:

Right.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and I guess

16

the idea is they're changing the permit so to -- to cure

17

that problem.

MR. COLANGELO:

The permit has changed.

5

as you say, is perfectly adequate?

6

MR. COLANGELO:

adequate.

The State agency renewed the permit.

8

a matter of course.

The point is that whatever monitoring the State agency

Okay.

So the upshot would

10

be, however, as I understand it, and correct me if I'm

11

wrong, that since they're doing that now anyway under

12

the new permit -- and you can question my hypothetical

13

assumption there -- but if they are doing it under the

14

new permit, then the only result of your winning this

15

would be to transfer the running of the district from

the agency to the court.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Mr. Colangelo, suppose we did

what the Solicitor General says to do and vacated

10

11

12

between these two issues that you can point to, such

13

that our making clear to the Ninth Circuit that they

14

made a mistake on one actually would affect their

15

analysis on the other?

16

Can you think of any reason why the Ninth Circuit
I mean, is there any connection

MR. COLANGELO:

There is one reason, Your

17

Honor, and that is that a permit is interpreted like a

18

contract, and it is a cardinal rule of contract

19

interpretation that a contract should be read where --

20

where possible to be both lawful and enforceable.

21

So the Ninth Circuit may go back down and

22

say, okay, with this corrected understanding of the

23

universe of law and facts that apply, we see that

24

Petitioner's reading of the permit would render it

25

unenforceable because none of the permittees can be held
50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

liable and, therefore, unlawful because the Clean Water

2

Act requires all permits to include within it

3

self-monitoring and self-reporting to demonstrate a

4

violation.

5

So the Ninth Circuit -- now, it may just --

6

it may just say, we say what we said before.

7

could reconsider on that basis, and that would be a

8

legitimate basis for it to do so.

9

But it

To go back to the earlier question about

10

where there is a discharge, there is no question that

11

Petitioner discharges these pollutants to these rivers,

12

so the only question for this enforcement proceeding is

13

where to measure Petitioner's discharges for purposes of

14

liability.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why is there no -- where

16

do I look to find out that the district is making a

17

discharge of polluted water, other than under the Ninth

18

Circuit's theory that it's in the river itself?

19

MR. COLANGELO:

Two places, Your Honor.

20

First is that it's a premise for the permit itself.

21

if you look at page JA 55, it says the Petitioner

22

discharges stormwater into these rivers.

23

very next paragraph shows that the Petitioner has done

24

an assessment of the pollutants that are typically in

25

its discharges, and it lists the ones that are now in
51
Alderson Reporting Company

So

And then the

Official

1

violation here.

2
3

So the permit, it didn't -- it came out of
this administrative process, and one of the elements --

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So is your theory that, if

5

the district is permitted to -- on a scale of 1 to 10,

6

to discharge up to 2, but that if the monitoring station

7

in the river shows an 8, then it is automatically liable

8

for the increase, even though other dischargees might

9

have made this?

10

MR. COLANGELO:

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

you have read.

Yes, yes, because -I don't get that from what

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Therefore, each one of them

is liable for all of it?

MR. COLANGELO:

Each one is liable for what they put in and bears the

5

burden to demonstrate and limit what it puts in.

6

7
8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's

But they haven't done so.

So what?
MR. COLANGELO:

So that's a permit

10

violation, and result is that this pollution continues

11

year after year after year, when the point of the permit

12

and the point of the Clean Water Act was to eliminate

13

what everybody agrees is the biggest source of water

14

pollution in Southern California.

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And this --

So if each permittee is

16

allowed to put in a 2, but one permittee puts in an 8;

17

then both permittees are liable?

18

MR. COLANGELO:

Correct, Your Honor,

19

unless -- because those facts are not known at the time

20

the violation is detected.

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No, no, we now know the

facts because it's the hypothetical.
MR. COLANGELO:

Okay.

So if the permittee

24

has done its own monitoring, in addition to what the

25

permit requires, and can demonstrate that it did not put
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

anything in, then it is not liable.

2

Two dischargers into the same river who agree in advance

3

to be measured by a single monitoring station in the

4

river are liable for what's measured there, and then

5

they sort it out.

6

If not, then yes.

And what -- Congress set up a regime that

7

would allow for system-wide and jurisdiction-wide

8

permits precisely because this problem was so

9

complicated.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are the

11

provisions -- excuse me, the provisions we've been

12

talking about, the three that you cited and the one that

13

youâ€™re -- are they boilerplate?

14

15

MR. COLANGELO:

Do they show up in every

Well, 109 -- the fact that

16

the permittees must conduct all monitoring to

17

demonstrate compliance, if "boilerplate" means that they

18

are in all permits, then, yes, because that's a

19

requirement of EPA regulations.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

What about the

21

one that says each permittee is responsible only for a

22

discharge for which it is the operator?

23

MR. COLANGELO:

That's from a EPA

24

regulation, too, yes.

That's in the definition of

25

"co-permittee" at 122.2; so, yes, that's also standard

in system-wide permits.
To go back to the earlier question about

3

where there is a discharge, the district court found,

4

and this is undisputed, at Petition Appendix 117, the

5

permit admits -- the permittee, Petitioner, admits that

6

it is discharging these pollutants, the ones measured in

7

violation, to these rivers.

8

question, no dispute that they discharged these

9

pollutants, a monitoring system included in the permit

So what we have is no

10

that the State court upheld against Petitioner's

challenge, showing that those limits have been exceeded.

But correct, the lower court

fully.

a little more here.

The Ninth Circuit did agree that all permits

Breyer, about could we sample from an individual

The problem with that is

that it would prove nothing.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY T. COATES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15
16

MR. COATES:

Thank you, Your Honor.

17

To the cross-appeal issue, the cases that we

18

cite talk about the Court's prudential limitation on

19

deciding questions that are not preserved by

20

cross-petition.

21

Mr. Colangelo, on that point as to what the Court's

22

cases say.

23

Kent case, and that is a case where, in fact, the

24

respondent was not seeking to change the judgment below.

25

They did not cross-petition.

And I depart from my learned opponent,

We cite the Northwest Airlines v. County of

They were just trying to

59
Alderson Reporting Company

1

keep what they had.

2

And the Court said we are not going to reach

3

that issue because, if we buy the fact that there is in

4

fact no private right of action, the effect of that is

5

to essentially change the underlying judgment --

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let me ask a quick

question.

8

MR. COATES:

Sure.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does it satisfy you if we

10

just write in the judgment what you -- we usually write,

11

and then you all can argue what it means below?

12

about that?

13

write something special?

Does that satisfy?

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. COATES:

What

Or do you want us to

It -- it's -- it's acceptable

16

because a reversal is always better than an affirmance.

17

But talking about what the Court decides and what's left

18

in the case, I think it is a case where the Court

19

reviews what the Ninth Circuit actually decided, what is

20

actually before it, and what is properly remaining in

21

the case because we don't believe the cross-appeal issue

22

is here.

23

And that leads, I think, to reversing the

24

Ninth Circuit because the district is entitled to

25

summary judgment on these two river claims.
60
Alderson Reporting Company

And I think

Official

1

that is all that's left in the case.

2

And I call the Court's attention to another

3

case we cited on the cross-appeal issue.

4

the NLRB cases, the -- the Express Publication case.

5

And it makes it very clear there, that the respondent

6

was just trying to hang on so much of what was good

7

about the order as he could keep and was not seeking to

8

change anything.

It's one of

1

MR. COATES:

Well, I do know that, in the

2

context of a lot of the Court's opinions, the Court will

3

specify that judgment be granted in terms of a party.

4

I know the qualified immunity cases, you

5

find someone's entitled to qualified immunity, and it

6

comes up on a summary judgment, the reversal is -- to

7

the Ninth Circuit.

8

but it's plain, from the text of the opinion, the

9

judgment is to be entered in favor of that party.

And I've seen both languages used,

10

And, again, I think that's appropriate here.

11

My opponent suggests and the government suggests, again,

12

that, let's go back to the Ninth Circuit and let them

13

consider this monitoring argument.

14

In fact, they even considered the use of contract terms

15

that -- that they urged them to consider again.

16

They considered it.

It's already rejected that claim with

5

A sort of remand for some consideration of

6

an issue that's already spoken on just doesn't seem to

7

make sense and invites the very sort of kind of

8

jurisdictional confusion that, I think, leads the Court,

9

for prudential reasons, not to consider these things

10

unless there's a cross-petition.

11

I think that's why this is kind of a great

12

example of why prudential reasons say you should not

13

consider it.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I understand,

15

and you do cite a lot of cases for that, but I can't

16

figure out what sense it makes.

17

willing to give up Santa Clara and Malibu, you're --

18

you're safe there, and that's the only thing you've won.

19

Why does it -- how does that make sense?
MR. COATES:

20

I mean, if you're

Well, the Court does it for two

21

reasons.

22

does look odd to affirm on -- to make a decision in this

23

Court on a ground that essentially repudiates the lower

24

court decision.

25

It does it as a prudential matter because it

It does it for prudential reasons.

And, in fact, the case they cite, LeTulle,
63
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

which basically says the Court has the jurisdiction to

2

do that -- when someone abandons the piecemeal claim --

3

is cited only once in this context after that, and

4

that's in the United States v. ITT Continental Baking

5

case, 420 U.S. 223, footnote 2.

6

And the court gives it a "but-see" for the

7

proposition that you have the jurisdiction to do it.

8

But then describes this exact situation and says, for

9

prudential reasons, we don't do it because it undermines

10

our cert jurisdiction, particularly if resolution of

11

that issue is highly fact-specific -- the one they are

12

trying to bring up -- and it would really foreclose

13

having to even decide this cert issue because you

14

wouldn't get to it.
