ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY E. MAGUIRE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. MAGUIRE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case is about who gets to decide the

12

facts that trigger a mandatory minimum sentence.

Any

13

fact that entitles a prosecution by law to a sentence

14

more severe than a judge could otherwise impose must be

15

found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

16

Under Harris, the government is entitled --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, could you

18

address an issue that's very important to me, the one of

19

stare decisis.

And so that -- hone in on that.

MS. MAGUIRE:

20

Yes, Justice Sotomayor.

I do

21

not believe that stare decisis poses a problem for the

22

Court in this case because Harris was a plurality

23

opinion.

24

I'm sorry, five of the Justices voted to uphold

25

McMillan, only four of the Justices found that McMillan

And while four of the Justices found that --

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was consistent with Apprendi.

2

And so we have a plurality opinion, and, for

3

our constitutional position, we do not believe that

4

Harris --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the problem is,

6

whether you're right or wrong -- and you're absolutely

7

right, it was a plurality opinion -- your adversary says

8

States have passed laws relying on it, the Federal

9

system is now structured around it, why isn't the damage

10

as great as they claim -- potential damage, I should

11

say.

12

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, first of all, I would

13

just note that, even though McMillan was decided in

14

1986, there is nothing in the legislative history that

15

indicates that Congress referred on McMillan when it

16

passed 924(c).

17

In addition, 924(c) is silent as to who

18

should be the fact-finder that triggers the mandatory

19

minimum.

20

not really a Sixth Amendment case --

21
22

And, finally, in the McMillan case, that was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
practical consequences.

23

MS. MAGUIRE:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Address, please, the

Certainly.
How many -- how many

Federal courts are you aware are already charging the
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

924(c) facts to a jury, notwithstanding the -- the fact

2

that it's not required?

3

MS. MAGUIRE:

Yes, I -- I would say that

4

there is little to no practical effect, if the Court is

5

to adopt a rule, because the majority of the Federal

6

courts are already -- and Federal prosecutors are

7

already -- alleging these facts in the indictment and

8

proving them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

9

think that this case is the exact example of that.
It was alleged in the indictment.

10

And I

It went

11

to the jury, the jury got a special verdict form, so

12

there is no difficulty in implementing this rule --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

But isn't your position that

14

a decision of this Court is not entitled to stare

15

decisis protection, if there isn't a majority opinion in

16

that case?

17

MS. MAGUIRE:

Yes, Your Honor.

I do not

18

believe that Harris has precedential value because it is

19

a plurality opinion.

20

In our --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I can think of some

21

pretty important decisions of this Court that were not

22

the result of a majority opinion.

23

adopt that as a blanket rule?

24
25

MS. MAGUIRE:

Do you want us to

No, Your Honor, but I would

note that, in constitutional questions like this one,
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

stare decisis is at its weakness -- weakest.

2

also --

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

I would

Constitutional

4

decisions of this Court not decided with the majority

5

opinion, no stare decisis effect.

6

MS. MAGUIRE:

That's your argument?

Well, and also, Your Honor,

7

what I think is significant in this case, in terms of

8

the issue of stare decisis, is that McMillan was not a

9

Sixth Amendment case.

McMillan was decided more on due

10

process grounds.

11

Amendment in McMillan comes in the last paragraph, when

12

it talks to the fact that the defendant has no right to

13

jury sentencing.

14
15

And the only discussion of the Sixth

And so, for those reasons, we do not believe
that stare decisis poses a problem.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You haven't distinguished

17

McMillan.

18

distinguish McMillan?

19

distinguishing that is it was not a

20

Sixth Amendment case, even though the opinion refers to

21

the Sixth Amendment?

22

You've distinguished Harris.

How do you

Your -- your only grounds for

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, Your Honor, it does, in

23

fact, refer to the Sixth Amendment in the very last

24

paragraph.

25

was a due process claim --

But what McMillan was mostly concerned about

6
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't care about

2

"mostly."

The issue is whether McMillan was a

3

Sixth Amendment case, in part or in whole.

4

know how you can say it wasn't.

5

cases on -- on what a case mostly says.

6

what it says.

7

MS. MAGUIRE:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

And I don't

We -- we don't decide
We decide on

That's absolutely -Ms. Maguire, you don't --

you don't have to take the position that there's no

10

stare decisis effect.

In a unanimous -- a recent

11

unanimous decision of this Court, obviously, would carry

12

more weight than one that has a plurality opinion, so

13

you don't have to say -- it isn't a question of yes or

14

no, it's a question of the degree of respect that we

15

would give to our former decision.

16

MS. MAGUIRE:

17

right, Justice Ginsburg.

18

factors that the Court considers when looking at stare

19

decisis is what were the margins of vote on the previous

20

cases, and McMillan was decided on a 5-4 decision,

21

whereas Harris, as we've noted, was a plurality

22

decision.

23

I think that that is exactly
And, in fact, the other

Both opinions were found over spirited

24

dissents.

They have been criticized by this Court and

25

the lower courts, and, in all of those instances, we
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

believe that stare decisis is at its weakest --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think it's important

3

for this Court to have a consistent doctrine of stare

4

decisis.

5

decisions that we don't like, but we will stick with

6

decisions that the majority does like."

7

looking for your understanding of what stare decisis

8

means in constitutional cases.

9

The doctrine can't be, "We will overrule

So I'm still

Now, with the suggestion of

10

Justice Ginsburg, I gather that your position is, if

11

it's a narrow decision, then it's -- stare decisis has

12

less weight; is that it?

13

it has less weight.

14

Why does it have insufficient weight here?

Now, what other factors?

Why isn't it controlling, though?

MS. MAGUIRE:

15

So

Because, Justice Alito,

16

another thing that you look -- look to, when you are

17

considering stare decisis, is whether or not the rule is

18

workable, whether or not the prior decision was badly

19

reasoned, and those are other factors that the Court can

20

consider.

21

And, if you look at this Court's Sixth

22

Amendment jurisprudence, as it has developed since

23

Apprendi, then in Booker, then in Blakely, then in

24

Cunningham, what we are asking for today is a logical --

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why is this not
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

workable?

2

whether it was right or wrong.

3

whether it has created some incongruity in the system.

4

I mean, you can -- you can argue about
You can argue about

But haven't the last number of years

5

suggested that it's perfectly workable?

6

what they are supposed to do; everybody does it.

7

why is this not workable?

8
9

MS. MAGUIRE:

Everybody knows
Why --

Well, the Harris rule is not

workable on a practical level because what happens under

10

the Harris rule is the government is entitled to a fact

11

that drives a more severe punishment that never goes to

12

the jury.

13

that the court find that, where there is a fact that

14

triggers a mandatory minimum, that that fact be found by

15

the jury.

If -- if -- and what we are asking here is

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now I understand --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That sounds like --

18

that sounds like an argument that it's wrong, and that

19

is, of course, the first step in -- in the stare decisis

20

analysis.

21

Justice Kagan's question is, in what sense is it

22

unworkable?

23

It doesn't sound, to me, responsive to

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, I think it becomes

24

unworkable in the drug cases, Your Honor, and in the

25

9841 statute because what you have there is you have, in
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some circuits, people alleging drug weight, but, in

2

other circuits, you have they called this mixing and

3

matching.

4

not exceed 20 years, the prosecutors are not alleging

5

the drug weights in the indictment.

And, as long as the statutory maximum does

6

And that becomes unworkable and quite

7

confusing to the courts.

8

criticized the Harris rule, primarily in cases like

9

Krieger and others that we -- are cited in our amicus

10

And the lower courts have

brief, that the rule is somewhat unworkable.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why wouldn't that be a

12

problem if -- if the question had to be decided by the

13

jury?

14

by the jury eliminate that -- that problem of the -- of

15

the mixing or not mixing?

Why does -- why does requiring it to be decided

16

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, asking it to be found by

17

a jury solves the problem because it -- it allows the

18

fact to go to the jury, the jury finds it.

19

a long history in this country that jury verdicts drive

20

punishment.

21

somebody is open to should be driven by the jury

22

verdict.

23

And we have

And so the idea is that the punishment that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You mentioned drug

24

weight.

Let's -- so you're making -- your argument

25

would mean that drug weight also has to be found by the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

jury because that can -- the length of the sentence can

2

depend on the -- the drug weight.

3

MS. MAGUIRE:

If the drug weight is going to

4

trigger a mandatory minimum, Your Honor, yes, we would

5

say that, under our rule, that that would have to be

6

alleged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond

7

a reasonable doubt, which, as our amicus briefs point

8

out, is being done already in the majority of circuits

9

throughout the country.

10

And so this is not going to put -- put any

11

additional burden on the prosecutors to be doing this.

12

And, fundamentally, what it does is that it levels the

13

playing field because what it does in trial situations

14

is it allows a defendant to know exactly what it is that

15

the government is going to prove.

16

The government then has to bring in those

17

witnesses at the time of trial, so that they can be

18

cross-examined on this fact that is going to trigger the

19

mandatory minimum in their case.

20

the playing field in that regard.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so it helps level

Now, if you were defending a

22

case involving drug weight and your client maintained

23

that he or she had nothing to do with these drugs, how

24

would you proceed?

25

my drugs, but if they were my drugs, they weren't --

Your argument would be:

11
Alderson Reporting Company

They're not

Official

1

they didn't weigh more than one kilo.

2

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, Justice Alito, those are

3

strategical questions that come up in every trial case

4

that we have.

5

lawyer, what your theory of the defense is going to be.

6

It's simply going to be, I wasn't there; or you may

7

decide to challenge the drug weight.

8
9
10

And you have to decide, as a trial

But those -- those strategic decisions exist
whether or not the Court adopts this rule or doesn't
adopt the rule --

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the question was

12

what -- what strategic decision do you think the lawyer

13

should make?

14

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, any strategic decision a

15

lawyer makes is going to depend on the individual facts

16

of the case.

17

For example -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So you -- but -- but

18

Justice Alito has a real problem.

19

the defense in a very difficult position?
MS. MAGUIRE:

20

What -- don't you put

You don't put the defense in a

21

very difficult position because, in fact, if you adopt

22

our rule, we believe that you are protecting the

23

defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury because this

24

is a fact that is going to be triggering a mandatory

25

minimum.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And, if the government has to prove it, they

2

then have to bring in the witness to the trial, who is

3

then subject to cross-examination, which is a far

4

more --

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but isn't it

6

difficult for you to say he had nothing to do with the

7

drugs, plus the drugs didn't weigh more than a certain

8

amount?

9

MS. MAGUIRE:

I don't believe that that is

10

difficult, and I believe that those are decisions that

11

you make in every case.

12

this case -- in Mr. Alleyne's case, our theory --

13

For example, in the case -- in

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think that I am hearing

14

that, in every case, you are going to want witnesses --

15

you are going to insist on a jury determination of the

16

amount.

17

That's kind of what I'm hearing.
MS. MAGUIRE:

That is the rule,

18

Justice Kennedy, that we are asking the Court to adopt,

19

that if there's a fact -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20

Justice Alito says why

21

doesn't that put defense counsel in a very difficult

22

position?

23

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, it doesn't put defense

24

counsel in a difficult position at all because those are

25

the same decisions that you make, whether or not you
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adopt this rule or you don't adopt this rule.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we're not getting

3

far with this.

4

order to preserve the constitutional right, you want us

5

to have a bifurcated trial.

6

say that.

7

But one answer you could say is that, in

MS. MAGUIRE:

I thought you were -- might

No, we are not -- we are not

8

asking for a bifurcated trial.

9

if there's one -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10
11

We are just asking that

That's good because that's

an extra problem.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Maguire, could I take

14

you to a different kind of question?

15

MS. MAGUIRE:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Certainly.
Let's assume that there were

17

a statute, and it said carrying a gun is an offense and

18

that the range is 5 to 10 years.

19

further in the real word, but let's just say 5 to 10

20

years.

21

that range, the judge shall consider whether the

22

defendant brandished the gun and whether the defendant

23

discharged the gun.

24

said.

25

I realize it goes up

And Congress said, in setting the penalty within

Now -- and that's all the statute

That would be constitutional; is that not
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

right?

2

MS. MAGUIRE:

Yes, Justice Kagan, that would

3

be constitutional because it doesn't have the mandatory

4

effect.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So it's

6

constitutional for the judge to say, seven years because

7

you brandished, nine years because you discharged.

8
9

So what makes it unconstitutional, what
makes it a violation of the Sixth Amendment, when, now,

10

Congress just provides something extra in the statute?

11

It says not just you shall consider brandishing and

12

discharging, but, if you find brandishing, you get 7; if

13

you find discharging, you get 9.

14

MS. MAGUIRE:

Okay.

What makes that

15

unconstitutional is because you are stripping the judge

16

of all authority, and, by operation of law, you are

17

telling that judge that you must impose this sentence.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that seems right as a

19

definitional matter, as a descriptive matter.

But I

20

guess the question I'm having difficulty with is why

21

does that matter for purposes of the Sixth Amendment?

22

The jury is doing the exact same thing, which is the

23

jury isn't doing anything in either of my examples.

24

So the only difference between example

25

number one, which you said was constitutional, and
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

example number two is that, now, Congress is giving

2

further instruction to the judge, but nothing more is

3

being taken away from the jury; is it?

4

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, yes, it is because, in

5

your second hypothetical, where it is the mandatory

6

minimum, which is exactly what we have in this case,

7

this notion that somehow Congress is channelling

8

discretion is a fiction because what it does is it tells

9

the judge, you must impose seven years, and you cannot

10

even consider what is authorized by the jury verdict in

11

this case.

12

And the jury verdict in this case authorized

13

a range of five years as the bottom.

14

happens is, when you have Congress coming in and saying

15

that, if you find this fact on a mere preponderance

16

standard, you must impose seven years, then you are

17

stripping the defendant of the benefit of the full jury

18

verdict in this case, which authorized a range that had

19

a lower floor than that called for by the Federal

20

statute.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so what

Ms. Maguire, could -- could

22

you repeat the first sentence you uttered in this

23

argument?

24

could you repeat it verbatim?

25

it to memory.

I -- I hesitated to jump in so early, but
Maybe you had committed

Good -- good counsel often does that.
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

(Laughter.)

2

MS. MAGUIRE:

Thank you, Justice Scalia.

3

It's -- my very first sentence was, "This case is about

4

who gets to decide the facts that trigger a mandatory

5

minimum sentence."

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

(Laughter.)

8

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

No, that wasn't it.

It started,

"Mr. Chief Justice."

10

(Laughter.)

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think what you said was

12

who has to decide a fact which causes a defendant to be

13

subject to a penalty that he would not otherwise be

14

subject to?

15

mandatory minimum, the defendant could have been given

16

that mandatory minimum.

17

And the fact is that, in the case of a

It was up to the judge.

So this mandatory minimum does not increase

18

the penalty to which the defendant is subject.

19

subject, in Justice Kagan's example, to any penalty

20

between one years -- one year and 10.

21

without the statute that she mentioned, could have given

22

him seven years because he -- he brandished a gun.

23

There -- there is really no -- no increase in the

24

penalty to which he is exposed.

25

The judge, even

And I thought that is what Apprendi
17
Alderson Reporting Company

He's

Official

1

addressed, any increase in the penalty to which you are

2

exposed, so that when you decide, I'm going to rob a

3

bank -- you know -- you know, when you go in, you are

4

going to get between one and 10 years, and, with a

5

mandatory minimum, you get between one and 10 years.

6
7

So what's the complaint, as far as Apprendi
is concerned?

8
9

MS. MAGUIRE:

The complaint is that -- and

why we believe that the rule we are asking the Court to

10

adopt, Justice Scalia, is a natural -- it follows the

11

logic of Apprendi, is because, in both cases, you have

12

judicial factfinding that's leading to a more harsh

13

sentence.

14

In your -JUSTICE SCALIA:

It isn't leading to a more

15

harsh -- more harsh sentence.

16

Apprendi.

17

than the judge would otherwise be authorized to impose?

18

And, in the case of a mandatory minimum, it never is.

19

The judge could impose that, if he was a hanging judge.

20

You know, you have some hanging judges; you have some

21

bleeding heart judges.

22

That's the whole point of

Does it lead to a sentence which is greater

And -- and what a mandatory minimum simply

23

says is -- you know, we don't care what kind of a judge

2

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well -- and I think,

3

Justice Scalia, that's -- that's a false presumption.

4

think that's the position of the government, that,

5

somehow, mandatory minimums channel discretion within a

6

range.

cannot go below this.

law?

Well, Justice Sotomayor, this

15

cited in the Lucas briefs and Dorsey briefs that this

Court is holding, that the majority of all defendants

18

convicted under 924(c) are, in fact, sentenced at the

19

mandatory minimum.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, in fact, your

21

argument is that fixing a sentence is different than

22

giving a judge discretion because it ignores the fact

23

that a judge might have given you less?

24

MS. MAGUIRE:

That is exactly right.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That seems to me --

19
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

sentence could be?

MS. MAGUIRE:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

That is exactly right.
Of having a judge decide

what your sentence could be?
MS. MAGUIRE:

That is exactly right.

8

it's further depriving you -- it is depriving the

9

defendant of liberty interests.

And

It is imposing a

10

stigma, and it is entitling the prosecutor to a greater

11

and more severe punishment.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's -- I'm not

13

sure that that's -- you've emphasized several times that

14

it takes away the discretion of the judge.

15

to me, to be a matter between Congress and the Judiciary

16

and not a Sixth Amendment question.

17

MS. MAGUIRE:

That seems,

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

18

actually, the language of this Court in Apprendi said

19

that it is unconstitutional for the legislature to

20

remove from the jury the assessment of facts that

21

increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a

22

criminal defendant is exposed.

23
24
25

And that is exactly what's happening in this
context because -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Apprendi, thought, did it
20

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

both ways.

2

Apprendi, but there are other sentences in Apprendi

3

which more go towards what Justice Scalia suggested,

4

that the question was increasing it above the maximum

5

that the jury authorized.

6

I mean, that's the best sentence for you in

So I'm not sure that we can get from the

7

language of Apprendi -- and I guess the question is, as

8

a matter of principle, why I -- I completely understand

9

why a defendant would care about this.

The question is

10

does it -- does it create a Sixth Amendment violation,

11

which is -- you know, the jury has to do this, when --

12

when Congress is decreasing the judge's discretion, but

13

it's -- either way, the jury isn't deciding this.

14

MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, Justice Kagan, we do

15

believe the Sixth Amendment is implicated because we

16

think the history of the Sixth Amendment in this country

17

shows that the role of the jury is the buffer between

18

the citizen meant to protect and the government.

19

And mandatory minimums give the prosecution

20

far much power.

And, in fact, if you do not adopt our

21

rule and -- and make the government have to prove it

22

beyond a reasonable doubt, what happens is then the

23

average citizen does not get the benefit of a jury

24

verdict, and his sentence is not driven wholly by the

25

jury verdict because, in this case, we had a jury
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

verdict, the government alleged the fact, we had a

2

special verdict form, the jury failed to find that fact.

3

As a result of that, then, the range to --

4

that Mr. Alleyne should have been exposed was a

5

five-year mandatory minimum and for the constitutional

6

argument assuming a maximum of life.

7

happened and at the sentencing hearing was on a mere

8

preponderance, the judge had to impose seven.

problem because the defendant -JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you -- you quoted

12

Apprendi correctly as saying that the jury has to decide

13

any fact which increases the sentence to which the

14

defendant is exposed.

15

and it's accurate.

16

That's the language you quoted,

Why does a mandatory minimum increase the

What it does, on a

That's true.

And that becomes the problem.
That's true.

But you must

acknowledge that that's not the theory of Apprendi.
MS. MAGUIRE:

Well, I think the theory of

Apprendi if you -- if you take it out to its logical

10

step, is that, if you have judicial factfinding that is

11

resulting in a more harsh sentence being imposed, then,

12

in fact, you have a Sixth Amendment problem.

13

And so what happens on the mandatory

14

minimums is that, if a judge finds the mandatory

15

minimum, a more harsh sentence is being imposed because,

16

as an example, in this case, the judge could not even

17

consider giving the five-year year floor as a mandatory

18

minimum, which we've already noted is, in fact, how most

19

criminal defendants are sentenced under the 924(c)

20

statute at the mandatory minimum level.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think the logic of

22

Apprendi is that the jury has to decide it if it

23

increases the sentence to which the defendant is

24

exposed, not if it eliminates some discretion of the --

25

of the Court.

He's exposed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

This Court should adhere to its decision in

15

Harris v. United States, which reaffirmed

16

McMillan v. Pennsylvania because those decisions

17

properly respected the fact that a mandatory minimum

18

divests the defendant of the right to judicial leniency.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I go back to a

20

simple question on the stare decisis, the practicality

21

question?

22

What is so impractical about letting a jury

23

decide an issue that sets a mandatory sentence of any

24

kind?

25

whether a gun was carried or brandished?

Why -- why are juries incapable of figuring out

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Why are they

Official

1

incapable of figuring out how many -- how much drugs

2

were sold or whether someone was driven by any of the

3

factors that States want to commit to judges, but the

4

Sixth Amendment might require them to submit to juries?

5

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Sotomayor, the

6

government's argument here is not that juries are

7

incapable of finding facts under the Federal statutes

8

that involve mandatory minimums.

9

sound reasons for wishing to allocate that factfinding

It's that Congress has

10

to the sentencing process and that it is not

11

unconstitutional for Congress to do so.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what does that have

13

to do with the needs -- the constitutional need to make

14

sure that juries are driving a fixed sentence of any

15

kind?

question, in my view, Justice Sotomayor, turns on

MR. DREEBEN:

The point of Apprendi

24

is a jury cannot be reduced to low-level gatekeeping.

Congress cannot pass a statute that says it is a crime
29

to assault someone, and that's punishable by one year in

Congress can't do that because it would

diminish the role of the jury in finding the critical

8

facts that constitute the crime that sets the

9

defendant's maximum exposure.

10

Apprendi protects against

that.

11

already exposed to the maximum penalty that the

13

defendant incurs under the statute, and that's what the

19
20

My only problem is why does it make a

MR. DREEBEN:

It matters because the Sixth

protect a right to judicial leniency.

And, now, the judge says, you know what, if I had my

MR. DREEBEN:

entirely accurate that judges do not give higher

sentences than the minimum.

6

in which they do so.

There are plenty of cases

All I'm saying is it's not the unusual case to

find ourselves in exactly this position, where the judge

wants to give five, the jury wants to give five, the

judge can't defer to the jury's verdict that it should

discretion to treat a fact within the range differently

these cases to be thrown out, even if there has been no

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

But I -- you know, the Petitioner

It seems to me the

The jury may well be right, that it's

1

impossible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that --

2

that the felon brandished a gun, but it's -- it -- it's

3

quite easy to say that it's very likely he branded a

4

gun -- brandished a gun, which is what the judge has to

5

find.

So he -- he's not even ignoring the jury finding.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

No, there is no inconsistency

7

between -- and I think, if you look at the way this case

8

evolves, it's not even clear that the jury rejected

9

brandishing.

What's very interesting about this case is

10

it's possibly the best illustration of the unfairness

11

problem that Justice Alito alluded to and that

12

Justice Breyer has written about in his opinions.

15

19

That was the issue at trial.

Nobody focused on it, and it allowed the

23

foreseen that a gun would have been used.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Dreeben, can I go

back to a point you made earlier?

You talked about a

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

legislature not attempting to supplant the jury's role

2

on the maximum.

3

started out in a country where almost all sentencing was

4

in the discretion of the judge; whatever crime you

5

committed, the judge could decide where to sentence you.

6

You don't see the same danger -- we

As Apprendi and its subsequent progeny laid

7

out, these sentencing changes that have come into

8

existence have really come into existence the latter

9

half of the last century.
What -- don't you fear that, at some point,

10
11

the legislature will go back to the old system of

12

supplanting the jury by just saying what it said in

13

924(c)?

14

Every single crime has a maximum of life.
And all the -- and every single fact that's

15

going to set a real sentence for the defendant, a

16

minimum, we're going to let the judge decide by a

17

preponderance of the evidence.

18

The bottom line of my question is, when

19

Apprendi was decided, what should be the driving force

20

of protecting the jury system?

21

discretion, whether that's permissible or not, or

22

whether a sentence is fixed in a range, whatever it

23

might be, by a jury?

24

MR. DREEBEN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The deprivation of

Justice -What's the better rule

39
Alderson Reporting Company

1

to keep both extremes from happening?

2

MR. DREEBEN:

I think, Justice Sotomayor,

3

that the Court recognized, in Apprendi, that its rule

4

was limited and to certain extent could be evaded by

5

legislatures, if they were inclined to do so.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Dreeben, I think that

7

history is wrong.

In fact, the way the country started,

8

there was no judicial discretion.

9

fixed penalties for crimes.

There were simply

If you stole a horse, you

10

were guilty of a felony, and you would be hanged.

11

That's where we started.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well -And I would think that the

14

risk involved is whether, if we come out the way that

15

the Petitioner here urges us to do, legislatures will

16

consider going back to -- to where we started from and

17

simply saying, if you brandish, you get seven years,

18

period, with no discretion in the judge.

19

That, it seems to me, is the greater risk.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I agree

21

in part with both you and Justice Sotomayor on history.

22

In fact, if you look at the 1790 Crimes Act that the

23

First Congress passed, many of the set sentences are

24

determinant sentences.

25

Others of the sentences were -- were
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prescribed up to a certain amount of years.

2

that, it was well understood that judges would find

3

facts to graduate the penalties according to the gravity

4

of the crime.

5

And, within

And what the legislatures have done in the

6

20th Century innovation of mandatory minimums within an

7

otherwise authorized range, as you have with 924(c), is

8

say, we would prefer that judges take into account

9

brandishing and discharging, as under Justice Kagan's

10

hypothetical statute, but we would like to -- to do that

11

in a uniform manner.

12

We know that they can find, by a

13

preponderance of the evidence, that brandishing exists.

14

We know that many, if not most, judges would consider

15

that worse than simple possession of a firearm in a

16

crime of violence, and we want judges to behave

17

consistently.

18

By proscribing consistency, they are acting

19

in accord with the historical tradition of having

20

determinate sentences, a tradition that this Court held

21

in Chapman v. --

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, the

23

historical -- you said, earlier, that most of the

24

historical evidence was that determinate sentences would

25

be decided by juries; they found facts, and a
41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

determinate sentence was given.

2
3

MR. DREEBEN:

And there was no judicial

discretion, which I think makes --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what is the judicial

5

discretion now?

6

evidence, and a mandatory minimum makes you give seven.

7

So where is the judicial discretion?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

You find by a preponderance of the

The judicial discretion is

what the defendant is losing.

He is not losing the

10

right to a jury trial because the very same verdict

11

authorizes the judge to find brandishing and impose

12

seven years.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You think, for a

14

defendant in a constitutional right, that they are

15

more -- that it's constitutional to have a determinate

16

sentence at seven and still constitutional -- and make

17

the jury find it by a -- beyond a reasonable doubt and

18

that it's still constitutional to have a determinative

19

sentence of seven years, but have the jury find it by a

20

preponderance of the evidence?

MR. DREEBEN:

MR. DREEBEN:

It's not just my position that
42

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

it's constitutional for a -- a judge to find mandatory

2

minimum triggering facts by a preponderance.

3

that a legislature could allocate that to a jury, if it

4

wishes to.

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, I know we said it in

Harris.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

I'm sure

Yes.
The question here before

us today is -MR. DREEBEN:

10

Yes.

And I think that -- that

11

not only does it not contradict any decision of this

12

Court to allow the judge to make those findings, it

13

doesn't contradict the principle behind the jury trial

14

right or the right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
JUSTICE BREYER:

15

Look, look, here's another

16

way of putting the same point:

With the mandatory

17

minimum, the judge can't go below the five years, okay?

18

But you say, well, he could have gone below

19

the five years anyway, couldn't he have?

20

he could have given you the five years anyway -- sorry.

21

He could have given you the five years anyway.

22

your point.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

I mean, you --

That's

Correct.
All right.

He could have

given you the five years -- he could have given you the
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

five years if you'd been -- if you had been convicted of

2

a different crime.

3
4

MR. DREEBEN:

And that's the difference

between this and Apprendi.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But why does that make a

6

difference?

7

heading on page 6 of their reply brief is almost right,

8

I think.

9

The best way I thought of putting it is the

I mean, I -- it says it's -- it's permitting

10

judges to find facts by a preponderance of the evidence

11

that compels sentences higher than a set of those

12

permitted by the jury's verdict.

13

That's exactly what's going on here.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

know, what is it?

Well -And -- and I -- I want to

And the trouble is --

17

MR. DREEBEN:

That's --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're just going to say,

19

well, he could have given the same sentence anyway.

20

I'm going to say, well, so what, why does that matter?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

And

It's descriptively accurate,

22

but it says nothing about the constitutionality of the

23

procedure.

24

focus not only on the fact that stare decisis is in

25

play, but that Apprendi has been a very history-driven

In this case, by comparison, there is no

analogies.

10

Not only is there no direct analogy to a

The sentence -- second pillar of their

16

historical argument is the procedure called benefit of

17

clergy, which was a form of what Blackstone called a

18

statute pardon, that allowed a defendant to avoid a

19

capital sentence.

20

In the First Crimes Act, in Section 31, in

21

1790, Congress said, "Benefit of clergy shall not exist

22

in the United States for any crime punishable by a

23

capital sentence."

24

part of this -- this country's Sixth Amendment heritage.

25

It was abolished before the Sixth Amendment was even

Benefit of clergy has never been

Alderson Reporting Company

ratified.

2

And the third pillar of their historical

3

argument are three late 19th Century cases, Jones,

4

Garcia, and Lacy, each of which involve statutes that

5

both raised the maximum and the minimum, not a single

6

one of them spoke about the Constitution.

7

purported to define what a legislature could do if it

8

wanted to raise only the minimum, and that's it.

9

None of them

And I would suggest to the Court that this

10

kind of Gertrude Stein history, where there's really no

11

"there" there, is not sufficient to overturn the

12

legislative prerogative to make uniform the findings of

13

fact within a range --

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dreeben, could I take

15

you back to the principles involved?

16

that, instead of this statute, which is 579, you had a

17

statute which was five for carrying, five up to life, and

18

then, for brandishing, 40.

19

we're discharging, 60.

20

Is your argument still the same?

21

All right?

All right.

MR. DREEBEN:

Let's suppose

And maybe if

So a very large gap.

The constitutional argument is

22

the same.

I think this Court's decision in O'Brien

would be deemed elements.

Those would be?

MR. DREEBEN:

"Deemed elements."

Under the

6

decision in O'Brien, where the machine gun finding

7

raised the minimum to 30 years, the Court held that it

8

should be deemed to be an element, but --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But suppose -- suppose that

10

Congress is absolutely clear about it, and you say --

11

and I think that you're right, you've got to be right

12

about this -- it's a constitutional matter, it's the

13

same, but the hypothetical sort of suggests exactly what

14

you said our inquiry ought to be, is that, in a world

15

like that, the jury is, in fact, functioning only as a

16

low-level gatekeeper; isn't that right?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No.
And that the only reason we

19

see it in the hypothetical a little bit more clearly is

20

because the numbers are a bit more dramatic.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

I wouldn't suggest that the

22

jury is being a low-level gatekeeper in that situation

23

because the jury's verdict alone -- and this is a

24

serious crime -- exposes the defendant to a life

25

sentence.

This is a crime that involves either a
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

predicate Federal crime of violence or a Federal drug

2

trafficking crime, plus the use of the gun in it.

3

And I think Congress could reasonably expect

4

that the worse the use of the gun, the more extreme, the

5

higher the corresponding penalty.

6

924(c) violation is charged by itself, and a defendant

7

is an armed career criminal, then his sentencing range

8

goes up to 360 months to life --

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And, indeed, if a

I mean, there's something

10

deeply incongruous, isn't there, where you have an

11

Apprendi rule which says if the maximum is -- you know,

12

if it's five to seven, and then the -- the judge says

13

seven years and a day, we're going to take that out, but

14

as a mandatory minimum that will leapfrog you from five

15

to 40 doesn't get the same result?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

It's not incongruous if you

17

look at it from the point of view of the fact that the

18

jury verdict itself allows a life sentence.

19

defendant draws the proverbial hanging judge who, in his

20

discretion -- or her discretion, wants to give that life

21

sentence, the defendant knew, from day one, when he

22

committed the crime, that, if the jury finds him guilty

23

of it, he's exposed to a life sentence.

And if the

sentences to crimes that are higher than what the

Under your theory, the democratic

So how -- what would we

12

MR. DREEBEN:

In that situation, the

13

democratic process would have concluded that firearms

14

brandishing, discharge, or use of a machine gun is an

15

extremely serious component of this crime.

16

judges will take that into account in sentencing.

simply want them to take that into account in the same

well, Apprendi, I see what they're thinking.

thinking that, once you have to add the extra fact to

It isn't really a new crime, but it's like a new crime.

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

We -- the critical point about Apprendi is,

9

But, I mean, are they true?

Respectfully, no.

by assigning the role of constitutional element status

10

to a fact that increases the maximum, the Court has

11

preserved the jury trial right against its reduction to,

12

essentially, a formality on a particular subset of

13

elements.

14

covered by Apprendi and the so-called base crime is like

15

a greater included offense and a lesser included

16

offense.

17

And the relationship of a crime that's

Whereas, in the mandatory minimum situation,

18

we know that the judge will be engaged in sentencing.

19

We know that the judge will find facts that extend

20

beyond the elements of the crime to inform himself about

21

how the basic crime is committed.

22

different judges may treat those facts differently after

23

finding them by the preponderance of the evidence.

24

The mandatory minimum changes only one

25

thing.

We also know that

It says, Judge, if you find this fact,
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

brandishing or discharge, you will impose the same

2

sentence as your neighboring judge down the hall, not a

3

different one based on your different perception of

4

sentencing philosophy.

5

So it allows the legislature to intervene

6

after having defined a sufficiently serious enough crime

7

and determine how the judges will treat those facts.

MR. DREEBEN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, it seems to me

13

that, whether you give it to a jury or a judge, the

legislature protects itself by declaring a minimum

sentence.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. DREEBEN:

There are many ways that a
