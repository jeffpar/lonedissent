Mr. Lerman?

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL N. LERMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. LERMAN:

We will hear

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about the plain text of the

12

FAAAA express preemption clause and the continuing

13

vitality of this Court's decision in Castle v. Hayes

14

Freight Lines.

15

I'd like to start by showing why the Port's

16

requirements here fall within the text of the statute

17

and cannot be saved by any market participant exception.

18

The FAAAA provides that no State or

19

political subdivision of a State may enact or enforce

20

any law, regulation, or other provision having the force

21

and effect of law related to rates, routes, and services

22

of a motor carrier.

23

issue here is the force and effect of law requirement.

24

And the Port's actions have the force and effect of law

25

under any reasonable interpretation of the phrase.

The only statutory language at

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 4

1

The Port is imposing binding standards of

2

conduct on motor carriers as a condition of accessing a

3

channel of interstate commerce.

4

those requirements through criminal penalties --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The Port is enforcing

I thought that the Port

6

said we don't apply criminal penalties which come from

7

the tariff, we don't apply those to licensed motor

8

carriers.

9

have to accept that as being so.

10

They made that representation, so I think we

MR. LERMAN:

They -- they did make that

11

representation and we could accept that, but it's

12

irrelevant because the Port is still imposing the

13

criminal penalties on the terminal operators.

14

a State is imposing criminal penalties, that is classic

15

governmental action, the State acting in its sovereign

16

capacity, regardless of whom the penalties are imposed

17

upon.

18

clear that States could regulate trucking activity

19

through penalties, in that case civil penalties, imposed

20

only on people who do business with truckers.

21

And when

And in this Court's decision in Roe, it made

Here, the State's requirements are coming at

22

the truckers from both ends.

On the one end, you have

23

the criminal penalties imposed on the terminal operators

24

to coerce their conduct and exclude truckers.

25

other hand, you have the tariff which puts conditions on

Alderson Reporting Company

On the

Official
Page 5

access to the Port of Los Angeles, which is a key

2

channel of interstate commerce.

3
4

So the Port's requirements here have the
force and effect of law in spades because using --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I break down your

6

arguments into two components, if you might?

7

not the market participant exception exists at all, and

8

if it does, how far does it go?

9

Whether or

So let's get to the first question in my

10

mind.

Seems almost impossible for me to believe that

11

the States couldn't require someone to put a little

12

placard like you get at the -- at almost any building

13

that you go into to park your car.

14

a little placard in the front of your window so they

15

know who you are and where you're going in the Port,

16

okay?

17

They ask you to put

Why is the placard requirement here any

18

different than that requirement generally?

19

you enter property, you have -- most people tell you put

20

a placard in the window to tell us you got permission to

21

come in.

22

MR. LERMAN:

Because if

It's -- it's different in this

23

case, Your Honor, because -- in addition to the overlay

24

that 14506 specifically targets identification

25

requirements, and -- and for purposes of this case,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 6

1

it's -- but I understand --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But even if that, if we

3

didn't have a market participant, why couldn't the State

4

say, when you come into the terminal, you just got to

5

put a little placard in so we know that you're not

6

parking here overnight when you've already been unloaded

7

or something else?

8

MR. LERMAN:

I think you need to look to the

9

particulars of this case, and the -- and the fact is

10

that the placard requirement here is codified into an

11

ordinance, it's backed by criminal penalties, and it's

12

restricting access to a channel of commerce.

13

have all those factors here, it has the force and effect

14

of law.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because we

Could the terminal say,

16

we have a pollution problem and only modern trucks can

17

come and unload here?

18

MR. LERMAN:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

No.
So they have to take

trucks that are too heavy for this crane to lift?
MR. LERMAN:

Heavy is a different scenario,

22

Justice Sotomayor, because there's an express exception

23

to the FAAAA for weight and size restrictions.

24

Congress carved out a series of exceptions for the FAAAA

25

for safety requirements, which gets to part of your

Alderson Reporting Company

So

question, for height and weight and size limits, for

2

requirements pertaining to the transport of

3

4

proprietary exception.

5

concerns may well be covered by one of these other

6

exceptions.

7

It did not create a

So a lot of Your Honor's

But there is no exception for a proprietary

8

action.

If it has the force and effect of law and it

9

does not fall within one of the enumerated exceptions to

10

the statute, then it is preempted under the terms that

11

Congress used.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even though -- even though

13

a related statute did -- did make an exception for

14

proprietary action, isn't that right?

15

MR. LERMAN:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

MR. LERMAN:

The FAAAA?

The ADA.
The ADA.

Yes, that's quite right, and

18

precisely because that statute contained an exception

19

and this Court has recognized that when Congress enacted

20

the FAAAA, it copied the ADA, and it copied the express

21

preemption clause, but it -- Congress chose not to

22

include that proprietary exception.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do we know why, why

24

Congress had a different regulation for ports and for

25

airfields?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 8

1

MR. LERMAN:

I don't believe the record --

2

the legislative history doesn't show why.

3

thought, clearly copied the statute and made the

4

decision not to include it.

5

But Congress

So by the terms of the statute, Congress

6

wrote a statute that preempts any action with the force

7

and effect of law, and it chose not to carve out an

8

exception for proprietary action which, as you say, Your

9

Honor, was included in the Airline Deregulation Act.

10

So that just lends added force to the

11

argument that the Act here does not contain an unstated

12

exception, an exception that Congress has created not

13

only for the ADA, which is the express model of this

14

Act, but in a host of other statutes where Congress

15

carved out specific exceptions for proprietary actions.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Except in Boston Harbor,

17

we said that there was a presumption in favor of it

18

unless Congress explicitly indicated to the contrary.

19

MR. LERMAN:

Well, Boston Harbor spoke to

20

express or implied indication of congressional intent.

21

Here there is express indication of congressional

22

intent, which is an express preemption provision

23

dictating the term -- the scope of preemption.

24

Boston Harbor --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Boston Harbor was implied

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 9

1

preemption, right?

2

MR. LERMAN:

3

was implied preemption.

4

clause to construe, and that language is in the context

5

of an implied preemption case.

6

notes, we have an express preemption clause, and we have

7

a clause that has carveouts for a lot of things, but it

8

does not have a carveout for proprietary action.

9

that is -- that is the best evidence as Congress has

10

That's correct, Your Honor, it
There was no express preemption

Here, as Justice Scalia

And

intended.

11

This Court has stated, when there's an

12

express preemption clause, the plain language of the

13

clause defines the scope of Congress's intent.

14

the plain meaning of the clause covers actions as here

15

that are backed by criminal penalties and impose

16

conditions of access to a key channel of interstate

17

commerce.

18

And here

That is the very definition of force and

19

effect of law.

The Port is invoking the full coercive

20

power of the State to impose conditions on motor

21

carriers, and that is exactly what Congress sought to

22

prevent.

23

impede the free flow of trade or that would result in a

24

patchwork of requirements from jurisdiction to

25

jurisdiction.

Congress sought to prevent State actions that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 10

1

That is what the Port's doing here.

It --

2

it conflicts with Congress's objectives and it falls

3

within the text of the statute.

4

by virtue of a market participant exception that, by

5

Respondent's own admission, is untethered from the text

6

of the statute itself for the reasons that we've

7

discussed.

8

except from the broad scope of preemption, and this

9

Court has reinforced the breadth of preemption, and did

10

And it cannot be saved

Congress made quite clear what it wanted to

not include --

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do we need to get into

12

the market exception if we find that this is -- has the

13

force or effect of law rather than being a private

14

contract?

15
16
17
18
19

MR. LERMAN:

No.

If this has the force and

effect -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's one or the other --

or both, but we could choose.
MR. LERMAN:

It either has the force and

20

effect of law or it doesn't.

If it has the force and

21

effect of law, it falls within the scope of the -- of

22

the express preemption clause and this Court does not

23

need to address any of that.

24

I'd like to turn my --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Some -- some of the rules

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 11

are okay, though, as you acknowledge, and I guess

2

there's a second question in the case.

3

MR. LERMAN:

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

5

Thank you --

You were about to get into

that anyway.

6
7

There is.

MR. LERMAN:

I was going to, but thank you,

Your Honor.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. LERMAN:

Okay.

I was going to get to the

10

second question in the case, which is this Court's

11

decision in Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines.

12

this Court held that -- that a State cannot enforce

13

otherwise valid requirements through a partial

14

suspension of a motor carrier's federally granted right

15

to operate in interstate commerce.

16

In Castle,

That is precisely the authority the

17

Port is claiming here.

18

authority to suspend or revoke motor carrier's access to

19

the Port of Los Angeles, the largest container port in

20

the United States and a key channel of interstate

21

commerce.

22

The Port is claiming the

That would affect -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

highway, a particular street, you think Castle doesn't

If it's -- if it's a particular

apply in that case?

2

MR. LERMAN:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

3

Castle spoke to partial suspensions of a motor carrier's

4

right to operate interstate commerce and I think it

5

cannot be denied that in this case because of the nature

6

of the Port, it is -- it would affect a partial

7

suspension.

8

single roads and I don't think there's any reason --

9

I don't think this Court needs to get into

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think you

10

have to get into it since I asked you a question about

11

it.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. LERMAN:

You're quite right,

14

Mr. Chief Justice.

15

camel's nose under the tent.

16

I don't see any reason to let that

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If it's a partial -Or you should stop

17

referring to a key component of interstate commerce.

18

doesn't matter whether it's key or not, does it?

19

MR. LERMAN:

That's quite correct.

It

It would

20

affect the partial suspension of interstate commerce, it

21

would seriously disrupt their interstate commerce

22

operations.

23

And Congress has not --

24
25

This falls within Castle's exact terms.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they say there's

this particular road, through a State park or something,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 13

1

that's scenic, and sometimes the trucks drive on the

2

side of the road and it causes damage to what the

3

State's trying to preserve.

4

if you do that three times and we warn you, the fourth

5

time you can't use this road.

And they have a rule, look,

That is preempted?

6

MR. LERMAN:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

road not too far away.

9

MR. LERMAN:

That is -There is another

You've got to use that one.
That is preempted under Castle.

10

The conventional forms of punishment might include the

11

three times and we fine an individual truck.

12

what the situation was in Castle.

13

violation of an otherwise valid regulation through a

14

partial suspension of interstate commerce.

15

that would qualify.

16

And Castle is --

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's

So you can't punish a

And I think

Castle's didn't say that,

18

Mr. Lerman.

19

to keep unsafe trucks off the road, but we're not

20

prohibiting you for past violations that you've cured.

21

All we're doing is keeping unsafe trucks out of our

22

port.

23

What if the Court is just saying, we want

MR. LERMAN:

Justice Kagan, the conventional

24

forms of punishment include, as we acknowledge, taking

25

an unsafe truck out of service or denying access.

Alderson Reporting Company

If --

Official
Page 14

1

if the truck is leaking hazardous material, the port can

2

deny access to that particular truck.

3

The key -- the key problem here is the

4

carrier-level suspension of access.

5

because that one truck for the carrier might be leaking

6

hazardous material, we are not going to let any trucks,

7

even perfectly safe trucks that don't present any

8

present -- clear and present safety risk into the port

9

until you fix that unsafe truck.

10

And so saying

And that's the authority reserved by the

11

State in this case, and that is what Castle said is

12

preempted.

13

invoke what Castle called conventional forms of

14

punishment, which we would concede includes the -- the

15

type of punishment Your Honor's contemplating, but what

16

it doesn't allow is a -- a suspension of access to a

17

motor carrier as a business entity.

18

And so we are not denying the authority to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why does that -- why

19

does it have to be truck by truck rather than operator

20

by operator?

21

found a couple of trucks that this company uses that are

22

unsafe, we're just going to keep the company off our

23

premises until the company can show us that they've

24

cured all their trucks, that they are a safe operator

25

now.

Why can't the port say, you know, when we

MR. LERMAN:

dealt with, Your Honor.

3

statutory scheme in Castle, which is Castle's decision

4

was predicated on a statutory scheme that gave the

5

Federal government exclusive authority to grant

6

interstate commerce permits --

7
8

And I was going to turn to the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does the Federal government

inspect trucks for safety and --

9

MR. LERMAN:

10
11

Because that's what Castle

It has regulatory --

JUSTICE SCALIA: -- leaking hazardous
materials and such?

12

MR. LERMAN:

I don't know that it inspects

13

it directly, and it has provisions for States to do

14

that.

15

13905 has exclusive authority to revoke a Federal -- a

16

motor carrier's Federally granted operating authority.

17

And so there are significant rights that States have to

18

impose --

But the Federal government still under 49 U.S.C.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. LERMAN:

Has it ever done that?

I don't know if it's ever done

21

that, but what it has done is -- is what Castle said,

22

which is -- is -- there was no reason to -- to deny that

23

the conventional forms of punishment are sufficient to

24

protect the State's safety concerns, and then if they

25

are not sufficient there was then and there still exists

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 16

1

a remedy, which is to go to the Department of

2

Transportation and ask them.

And that remedy exists to this day under 49

present in Castle and animated this Court's decision in

7

concern, there are ways to deal with it.

8
9

The same statutory scheme that was

So if they have a safety

They can do what Justice Kagan suggested,
which is to deny access to a particular truck.

They can

10

go to the Department of Transportation and ask for --

11

for some type of exemption.

12

assert the veto power that this Court held was precluded

13

in Castle and in the city of Chicago cases, and that is

14

precisely the veto power that they are asserting here.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what they can't do is

Can I make a somewhat --

16

this is how I'm seeing the case and there is some

17

mystery in it to me and it would affect how I might

18

write this thing or consider it.

19

Look, what they want to do is to not have

20

trucks park in the neighborhood on the street, and they

21

want to put a tag on it.

22

you seem to have said what they should have done.

23

go to the NTSB and you ask, and they do it.

24

approve it or they don't.

25

All right.

So the second -You

They

And their -- their problem is that they

Page 17

1

don't want 40 or 50 States each saying a different

2

sticker, all right?

3

with stickers and that's the problem.

4

problem.

So then the whole back fills up
That's the

You go explain, et cetera, okay.

5

But the first part, the parking, it seemed

6

to me of course they should be able to do that.

And

7

there seems to me to be a tailor-made exception, the

8

authority of the State to impose highway route controls

9

or limitations.

And if that isn't tailor-made for this,

10

I don't know what is, I mean, I don't know what it's

11

doing there.

12

And so why has nobody done that?
When I read the lower court on that, they

13

said, oh, it affects fares and it affects services.

14

Every route restriction affects fares and services, you

15

know?

16

tailor-made for what they want to do.

17

of problems with the proprietary thing.

18

supposed to do?

19

tailor-made for this isn't in the case.

So here I see an exception which seems
I see all kinds
What am I

What -- what I see as the exception

20

MR. LERMAN:

I think that's --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what do you suggest?

22

And it's a question for both sides.

23

MR. LERMAN:

You're right that it's not in

24

the case, Your Honor.

It's not in the case because the

25

only issue here was whether it has the force and effect

2

3

because the port was acting arguably in part by a

motivation for community goodwill.

I don't think this is a route

I don't know if it would qualify, and that

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, you can't say,

15

This is

If you

can say that, why can't you say do it part of the time?

16
17

MR. BASH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think the city

19

could pass a regulation like Justice Breyer suggested,

20

that says, stay off residential streets?

21

MR. BASH:

Well, if the city were to pass

22

that regulation, they'd have to make out a record that

23

it either -- it comes within one -- one of the

24

exceptions.

Now, it could have been the safety

25

exception.

The Port argued for that here and the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 20

1

district court rejected it on the record after hearing

2

testimony about the alleged safety and hazardous cargo

3

justifications.

4

They didn't make an argument under sizes and

5

weights.

Presumably, they could make that record.

6

You'd have to see about the strength of their

7

justifications.

8

the case they would have to apply uniformly to trucks of

9

a given size or weight.

I'd note that I -- it would probably be

Here, they were only going

10

after drayage trucks, which are a particular category of

11

trucks.

12

with respect to all trucks or if that was their intent

13

here.

I don't know if they could make that showing

14

I would like to turn, if I could, to Justice

15

Ginsburg's question about the criminal penalties in this

16

case.

17

face value that the criminal penalties would only fall

18

on the marine terminal operators.

19

we don't think that makes a difference.

20

We accept the Port's statement in their brief at

But, like Petitioner,

If, for example, the State Highway

21

Commission said, okay, certain trucks can't use our

22

roads unless you sign a certain agreement.

23

worry, if you don't agree to bide by that agreement we

24

won't do anything to you, but we will throw every person

25

who does business with you in jail.

But don't

Whatever else you could say about that

2

scheme, I think it would be pretty clear that it would

3

be the act of a sovereign and so it would have the force

4

and effect of law within the meaning of this statute.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bash, what would you

6

think of this case if the criminal penalties were taken

7

out of it?

8

through contract, basically said to each terminal

9

operator, look, if you contract with truckers that don't

In other words, if the Port did this all

10

have this concession agreement, we are going to charge

11

you a higher price.

12

So -- so if the criminal penalties were not

13

in the case, is there enough here to still make this the

14

force and effect of law?

15

MR. BASH:

Yes.

We think not only is there

16

enough here, but there's another sort of a bright-line

17

rationale before you get into the Boston Harbor sort of

18

understanding of if this is regulatory or market

19

participant.

20

our brief, which is we don't consider the Port the

21

equivalent of the cement factory in Reeves, like a

22

commercial enterprise that you might see in the private

23

marketplace.

24
25

And that's the second factor we cite in

This port authority, like I think virtually
all other port authorities in charge of these massive

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 22

1

container ports, hold land much like a highway

2

commission in trust for the public.

3

This is not private property ownership.

If

4

you look at all the different metrics of success the

5

court of appeals pointed to and the district court

6

pointed to and I think the Port points to in their

7

brief, they are not bottom line business metrics like

8

shareholder value and dividends and so forth.

9

It's economic vitality of the region.

10

the number of jobs it brought to the L.A. area.

11

not the mark of a commercial enterprise.

12

of a regulatory body.

13

candidate might point to.

14

It's

That is

It's the mark

It's something a mayoral

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's not

15

true.

16

attract customers because of its reputation as a -- as a

17

green company because of its reputation of hiring local

18

workers.

19
20
21

I mean, a commercial enterprise might want to

I think you have too confined a notion of
what -- what's good business.
MR. BASH:

I think it's true that Wal-Mart

22

might say, hey, we don't do business with labor law

23

violators, or we adhere to certain environmental

24

practices, as part of a marketing campaign.

25

what this Court said in Boston Harbor was that, yeah, a

Alderson Reporting Company

But I think

Official
Page 23

1

private business could boycott labor law -- law

2

violators too, and, in a sense, the private business

3

would be engaged in quote-unquote regulation.

4

But when the government does that, when the

5

government uses its special place in society and its

6

enormous economic power to effectively leverage its

7

power to impose regulation, that's -- that's

8

fundamentally different, and that is not the government

9

acting in a market capacity even though, sure, Wal-Mart

10

or Starbucks could do a similar thing.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is it part of your

12

argument that the city contracts with the port and then

13

the port contracts with the truckers, but at that point,

14

the ports are -- are confined in what they can do?

15

There can be really no bargaining between the ports and

16

the truckers based on what the city has already told the

17

port?

18

MR. BASH:

Justice Kennedy, that -- that's

19

like our third order argument.

I mean, our first order

20

argument is criminal penalties and just the nature of a

21

port and -- the Port doesn't contract with the city.

22

The Port is a department of the city, and its members

23

are appointed by the mayor and its revisions to the

24

tariff are codified in city ordinances.

25

every way a part of the city, it's not just a

Alderson Reporting Company

So it's in

Official
Page 24

1

contractual relationship.

2

We think just the criminal penalties here

3

and the nature of what a port is.

A port -- a

4

regulatory body that governs a critical part of public

5

infrastructure is enough to resolve this case.

6

think no, the criminal penalties don't matter and this

7

Port is more like the cement factory in Reeves, it's

8

really just a plain vanilla commercial enterprise, we do

9

think the fact that it's leveraging significant economic

If you

10

power, that it's the only place in L.A. to do this

11

business, is part of this sort of Gould market

12

participant analysis.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Bash, how then do you

14

deal with the problem that precipitated all of this?

15

Here is a port that's getting lots of complaints from

16

the neighborhood people.

17

it's being thwarted by environmental suits, so it wants

18

to go green and it wants to do something about the

19

pollution and the traffic and the hazards from the

20

truck.

It wants to expand the port,

You're saying that it can't do that?

21

MR. BASH:

We're -- we're not saying it has

22

no recourse.

And I just note parenthetically that the

23

same could be true of any state highway commission

24

that's contemplating an expansion of a highway project.

25

They could face similar suits based on environmental

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 25

1

complaints.

2

opposition, we don't want these huge trucks coming

3

through our neighborhood.

4

and acts of a highway commission, particularly if backed

5

by criminal penalties, acts that lack enforcement.

6

They could face similar community

That doesn't make the decrees

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And how could a port

7

respond to the complaints if you're making this -- this

8

neighborhood around the Port an environmental hazard?

9

And so we're going to make sure that our representatives

10

vote against any expansion of the Port.

11

MR. BASH:

To -- to deal with that sort of

12

effectively political opposition, community opposition,

13

I think the Port retains a lot of flexibility under the

14

statute to address them.

15

If you look at page 90 through 93 of the

16

Pet. App, it discusses the extensive incentive programs

17

that the Port established.

18

trucks currently serving the Port, or at least at the

19

time the district court's opinion was written, are new,

20

clean trucks that don't have the same emissions problem.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

But wait.

Why isn't the --

22

I mean, I thought that the purpose of these

Of course States and cities can have

That's the purpose of that
I mean, I -- I thought that's what

And, of course, you're quite right in saying

8

that, that I'm not seeing?

9

Okay.

MR. BASH:

Fine.

It says it based on

What's the problem with

I took Justice Ginsburg's

10

question to be addressing a slightly different point.

11

The exceptions are for things like safety, hazardous

12

cargo --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, it says, "The

14

authority of a state to impose highway route controls or

15

limitations based on the size and weight of the motor

16

vehicle or the -- or hazard -- or hazardous nature."

17

And it's size and weight, hazardous nature.

18

isn't there room in those words to include environmental

19

consideration?

20

MR. BASH:

I mean,

There -- there may be.

It's

21

obviously an issue that hasn't been briefed in this

22

case.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
You think there is?

I don't think there is.

You can ask the question.

JUDGE BREYER:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Seems to me the answer is

no.
MR. BASH:

But I -- I just wanted to

4

emphasize for Justice Ginsburg, though, that there are a

5

lot of things that ports and other -- other municipal

6

entities can do to address environmental concerns.

7

they've been done in this case.

8
9

And

It is the replacement of these trucks, which
was done through a subsidy and incentive program that's

10

remarkably similar to the one this Court blessed as

11

market participation in Hughes that allowed these

12

extensive emission reductions that the Port's seen.

13

That sort of direct participation in the market has all

14

the hallmarks of what we don't have here.

15

enforced through criminal penalties.

18

market and purchasing trucks, effectively becoming a

19

part owner of the truck.

20

It's not

It's not the --

It's actually entering the drayage

So I do think that the Port has extensive

21

authority to address environmental concerns within the

22

confines of this preemption statute.

23

The Chief Justice asked about the Castle

24

question, whether it matters or what if you just didn't

25

want a road or what's the size of it?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 28

1

I will say that the court in Castle seemed

2

to think it made a difference, the sort of size of the

3

imposition, but I don't think it needs to make a

4

difference anymore because we have a direct preemption

5

statute.

6

We think that the logic of Castle applies

7

not only in the context of the licensing scheme that has

8

changed but was effectively in place during Castle, but

9

under Section 14501(c) itself.

14501(c) says States

10

can't pass regulations that relate to prices, routes,

11

and services, but it also gives States safety exceptions

12

and so forth.

13

those two provisions.

14

And there needs to be a reconciliation of

I think we'd all agree that if a State -- if

15

a truck committed two safety infractions, you couldn't

16

say, well, now we're going to regulate your prices,

17

routes, and services as punishment for that infraction.

18

This -- the framework we've set forth in the Castle

19

portion of our brief I think is a reasonable

20

reconciliation of the State’s --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you -- do you think

22

that a statute that says if you're a trucking company

23

operator and you have three violations of X safety

24

regulations, you just can't use our highways because we

25

don't trust you, is that okay?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 29

1

MR. BASH:

No, that's certainly not okay.

2

We think that fails under both the holding of Castle and

3

just under the current presumption provision, which is

4

maybe the easier way to do it.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

Why isn't it a

6

standard fact that States and cities use to stop people

7

from repetitive violations to tell them, if you keep

8

doing this and don't remedy what you've done, we're just

9

not going to let you do X, Y, and Z?

10
11

Why wouldn't the

safety violate -MR. BASH:

Well, it should be clear at the

12

outset that we're not talking about people, we're

13

talking about motor carriers as an ongoing enterprise.

14

So we're not saying an individual can't have their

15

license revoked.

16

Are you finished with the question?

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

MR. BASH:

Finish your answer.

But more broadly, we think the

19

Federal regulatory scheme in combination with this

20

preemption provision just bars States from taking

21

certain actions that would affect the interstate

22

operations of motor carriers.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

5

At issue today are two provisions contained

6

in a contract between commercial actors.

7

conditions under which drayage trucks can enter the

8

nonpublic portions of the Port, and they are

9

indistinguishable, indistinguishable from contract

10

provisions that private parties routinely impose on

11

exception, what it is generally congruent with, what is

meant by Congress by the term "force and effect of law."

you enforce these requirements, and his answer was,

14

primarily through our lease contract.

15

don't want to do away with the -- with our lessor, but

16

there is no indication, and there is no fact on the

17

record that these criminal penalties, which our

18

opponents keep dredging up, are ever used against MTO's.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Obviously, we

Is that how we decide these

20

things?

When there is on the books a criminal penalty

21

that can apply to everybody, do we let the State come in

22

and say, oh, you know, no harm, no foul because it's on

the books, but we -- we don't really use it.

don't know -- I don't know that we do that.

The State of California decides, here's what we

his goods and services, cannot charge less than $30 a

pound.

All right?

Plainly preempted.

within, then I'm not sure what we're talking about

22

within the rates, routes and services, and then the

23

question is, is there proprietary exception, et cetera.

24
25

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, the -- the answer –

our position is that even if it is rates, routes, and

services, that what we are doing is not regulation, that

2

this is proprietary.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's why I asked you, and

how does it differ from the hypothetical I just put?

5

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I think -- I think -- it

6

differs from that because we're not prescribing any --

7

if we are describing -- if we are prescribing it, it's

8

inherent within our ability to access our particular

9

land.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You are saying that you

11

can do by contract what you cannot do by regulation.

12

And I don't understand that argument when there are

13

criminal penalties that attach to the breach of the

14

contract.

15

MR. ROSENTHAL:

But, Justice Kennedy, let me

16

say again, there are no criminal penalties that attach

17

to the breach of the contract.

It is purely a contract.

18

The remedies are purely civil.

20

penalties to the breach of the concession agreement.

MR. ROSENTHAL:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's

why it's a hypothetical.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

But there's a difference,

22

and let me give you the difference, Justice Scalia.

that is in this particular case we are dealing with a

22

It runs a police department, it runs -- it
It does, in the

I think I would posit is far closer case, it seems to me

than what we're dealing with here, which are marine

But nonetheless, in Boston Harbor this Court

5

held that the regulation of who could work in Boston

participant doctrine.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
preemption in Boston Harbor.

It was -- it was implied
Here you have an express

10

preemption clause which contains exceptions, and among

11

those exceptions is not the running of a commercial

12

enterprise, even though that is made an exception in a

number of other Federal statutes -- Federal preemption

That's a very high hill for you to climb,

It's not the only thing,

Justice Scalia, I'm relying on.

19

language which Congress put in, which are words of the

20

limitation, which is force and effect of law.

21

I'm also relying on the

If Congress had not -- had said any

22

requirement by the Port, any requirement by a city

24

they're only talking about things which have application

25

to the general public.

Alderson Reporting Company

But

Official
Page 40

2

We submit that force and effect of law
almost invites a market participant analysis.

3

Let me also respond to your point about the

4

ADA, the Airport Deregulation Act.

The reason there is

5

a limited exception for airport proprietors, as this

6

Court has held, is because there was a longstanding

7

issue about airports being able to impose restrictions

8

about noise pollution on surrounding communities.

9

Congress was well aware back in the 1970s,

10

when this statute was enacted, of that controversy and

11

they wanted to preserve the existing rights of

12

airports.

13

respect to truck ports or ports or the government that

14

was ongoing in 1994 when this particular statute was

15

adopted.

16

There is no comparable controversy with

But let me point out that what did -- did

17

occur in 1994 was that Congress was writing against the

18

backdrop of this Court's decision in the Boston Harbor

19

case, in which Congress was told that in the absence of

20

something express, which says that a city or State can't

21

manage its own property when it pursues its proprietary

22

interests, that there would not be inferred -- not be

23

inferred -- a restriction on a State's power to manage

24

its own property.

25

So unlike the situation when the ADA was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 41

1

adopted, when the FAAAA was adopted in 1994, there was,

2

we submit, a background principle, which this Court had

3

enunciated earlier, that there was a presumption that

4

our proprietary powers were to be preserved.

5

If -- if I can, I'd like to go on to the

6

Castle argument as well.

7

different points in Castle.

8

is that the Castle decision was predicated upon a very

9

specific statutory regime that existed in -- under the

10

Our point -- we make three
First of all, our position

Federal Motor Carrier Act of 1935.

11

Justice Black specifically noted the details

12

of that statutory regime, which included certificates of

13

convenience and necessity, very precise rules under

14

which trucks were to operate within -- within the United

15

States.

16

That regime has died.

17

18

it existed, died with that regime.

Mr. Rosenthal, could I

22

the Port?

23

companies do you exclude?

24
25

Who do you exclude from

What trucks -- what trucks or what trucking

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, in fact, we don't

exclude anybody from the Port.

We simply ask that those

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 42

1

trucks that come on to port property sign a nonexclusive

2

concession agreement which agrees to certain conditions.

3

So drayage trucks that come on, on a regular

4

basis, have to sign these conditions.

5

out that people who operate at our Port intermittently

6

can get day passes.

7

We would point

And generally speaking --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What -- what if they

8

violate those conditions?

I mean, that's -- that's

9

where the -- that's where the shoe pinches.

What if

10

they violate those contractual conditions?

11

exclude only the truck that violates it, or do you

12

exclude the whole trucking company?

13

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Then do you

Well, we -- we -- there's a

14

gradation of remedies.

We don't -- we have -- we have

15

generally not excluded or revoked.

16

we've done is tried to get compliance.

17

there are penalties, there are mechanisms of a

18

contractual nature which are used.

Generally, what

19

Those are the principal --

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What's the ultimate?

21

What's the ultimate?

22

you whack them with a big penalty.

You've tried everything else and

23

What is that?

24

MR. ROSENTHAL:

25

There are --

In -- in cases involving

fraud, criminal penalties of a continuing nature, we can

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 43

1

suspend or revoke their right to come on to the

2

property.

3

deals with the Castle argument --

4

That's the ultimate.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but -- and this

And -- and not just the

5

noncompliant trucks, but the entire operator for

6

having some noncompliant trucks, is that correct?

7

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Again, we -- this -- there

8

hasn't been this experience of -- of having to revoke

9

and -- and suspend in cases like what you're describing.

10

There are -- for example, there has been revocations

11

when LMC has not had the insurance it's required, but

12

that applies to all of their trucks.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, if you're saying there

14

isn't that experience, I mean, could -- are you in a

15

position actually to represent that you would not

16

exclude anything except noncompliant trucks?

17

MR. ROSENTHAL:

There -- there hasn't been

18

the experience.

What we said before is that the

19

severest penalties are intended for severe continuing

20

offenses.

21

there are reasonable applications of the revocation --

22

of the suspension requirement, given the fact that ATA

23

has launched a facial attack on our regulation, that it

24

will be sufficient time to deal with an as-applied

25

Castle.

And our position is that, given the fact that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 44

1

If Castle survives and this Court --

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are three reasons,

3

and the first one, I -- I'm not sure why it wouldn't

4

survive in a policy of deregulation it would seem to

5

apply a fortiori, or equally, but I don't want to argue

6

that with you.

7
8

I want to be sure I have the second and
third.

9

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Yes.

Let me -- let me give

10

you -- let me give you my -- the three.

11

First, we don't believe Castle continues.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13
14

But what is the second and

third?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

Second -- second argument --

15

second argument is that even under the Castle regime,

16

all Castle talked about is going -- allowing a truck to

17

go up to a customer's property line, that -- that a

18

certificate of convenience and necessity never gave

19

anyone permission to go into Wal-Mart or anything else.

20

And that's what we're talking about here.

21

And thirdly, our position is that given this

22

is -- this being a facial attack, given the fact that we

23

believe that there are lawful applications of -- of the

24

revocation to ongoing continuing violations, which is,

25

frankly, the only -- I can't make a representation --

Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

doctrine.

3

that it?

This is a facial attack to a contract?

MR. ROSENTHAL:

5

a facial attack to -- it is.

6

contract.

7

contract at all.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

We have to attack this

application?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

But -- but they're arguing

that our contract is tantamount to a law.

13
14

It's a facial attack to a

contract provision by provision -- or application by

11
12

Well, but -- it's a -- it's

We don't believe that it applies to our

8

10

Is

I mean, you --

4

9

I've never heard of this

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.

And I've

heard of facial attacks to criminal statutes.

15

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Right.

And -- but they are

16

attacking this remedy to -- they've -- they've --

17

talking -- they are attacking this on -- on its face and

18

saying that no application of this provision is -- is an

19

exception.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

would be?

22

where, given Castle --

Give me the example that you're thinking of

23

MR. ROSENTHAL:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

And what's the one that

Yes.
-- and its applications, it

would be --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 46

1

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Where -- where a truck is in

2

continuing violation, a company is in continuing

3

violation of a safety restriction.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now, how

5

does -- how -- how would that differ from Castle?

6

Because what Castle was concerned about was a State that

7

has a perfectly lawful regulation, and it's violated,

8

then the State as the remedy excludes the truck from the

9

State.

10

MR. ROSENTHAL:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because -That's what it's concerned

12

about.

And it didn't say anything about accepting very

13

serious violations, i.e., continuing ones.

14

was the need for interstate regulation of an interstate

15

enterprise.

16

the ICC, a fortiori, where it's deregulatory policy, but

17

leave that to the side.

18
19

Leave it to

I want to know your best case in that one,
and I don't see the example yet.

20
21

And that was the reasoning.

The reason

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Let me -- let me try to

respond, Justice Breyer.

22

I think if one reads the opinion in Castle,

23

Castle dealt with a past violation, not a continuing

24

violation.

25

the -- and I think the words of the -- Justice Black

The record in that case didn't deal with

Alderson Reporting Company

1

said that would be a different case, that there would be

2

a right to exclude a continuing violation.

The agreement requires the operators to have

MR. ROSENTHAL:

10

You certainly may.

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

It has to do

11

that for a reason.

12

use that off -- off-site parking, that the operator is

13

in default?

14

It means that if its trucks don't

Is that the City's position?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

If -- if it does, it submits

15

an off-street parking plan for all of the trucks which

16

are registered to go onto the property, and it has to

17

agree to keep those trucks in the off-site parking.

18
19

If it breaches that agreement, it's treated
as a breach, and we --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I just wanted to make

21

sure.

What you're saying is if trucks park anywhere

22

else, then the operator's in violation of the agreement.

23

MR. ROSENTHAL:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

That -- that's correct.
All right.

With respect

to the placard, as I read the provision it says you have

Alderson Reporting Company

Official
Page 48

1

to have the placard coming in and going out.

2

like one of those parking placards that people can affix

3

temporarily or does it have to be a permanent?

4
5

MR. ROSENTHAL:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
you?

Well, how does that help

Meaning to --

8
9

No, it does not have to be

permanently affixed to the truck.

Is this

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, there were -- we -- we

provide them if they want a sticker they can put on

10

their truck, but we don't require it.

11

the words.

12

trucks of this type, have a -- have a frame on the

13

outside where they temporarily put plaques, for example,

14

at times when they are carrying hazardous materials.

15

You probably have seen that color design on the side.

16

Those are temporarily affixed.

17

We just give them

And most trucks, in fact virtually all

So if a trucking company, an LMC, wished to

18

just put the plaque on as it's crossing the gate and

19

take it off when it's leaving the gate, it's -- it's

20

fully lawful to do that under our restrictions.

21

Most of them just leave -- leave it on, but

22

that's not required.

23

enters, while it's on Port property, and when it leaves,

24

as it leaves.

25

The plaque is only required as it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how is the public

going to use that plaque?

2

MR. ROSENTHAL:

What?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

loading to call in complaints?

6

How is the public going

The public hangs around the Port as it's

MR. ROSENTHAL:

there are members of the public include also the people

So it acts -- it has a certain enforcement

16

My point --

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would you clarify --

18

would you clarify what the -- what happens when there is

19

an infraction?

20

can suspend until the infraction is cured, that you can

21

suspend all of that operator's trucks?

22

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Say three trucks.

Is it right that you

We -- we are -- there has

23

been very little practice, Justice Ginsburg, under that,

24

other.

Or could you say, until you fix those two

We -- we have built in a

I mean, it's not purely a matter of grace.

10

We classify things as minor violations and major

11

violations.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's say it's a major

violation.

14

MR. ROSENTHAL:

If it were a major violation

15

involving something we believe was systemic within the

16

LMC, the -- the -- not the regulation, but the

17

concession agreement would leave the possibility that we

18

could revoke or suspend until the problem was corrected.

19

But -- but --

And how about after it's

corrected?

The government then says there's some

And generally speaking, our intent has been, as we

stated in the lower court and as we stated repeatedly,

3

to use this for continuing violations.

4

really talking about future actions because revocation

5

and suspension have not been common.

6

But we are

Let me conclude by making two points here.

7

Number one, this Port undertook these actions as a

8

reasonable and genuine response to the needs to build

9

and grow a port.

If we are prohibited from taking what

10

are substantively limited actions to control trucking,

11

then essentially we're going to be in a posture in which

12

this Port will be disabled by its surrounding community

13

from doing what it needs to do to compete.

14

Secondly, we submit you cannot be the

15

owner-proprietor of property without having some control

16

over the conditions under which owner -- under which

17

invitees, business invitees, come onto your property,

18

that this statute of Congress was not intended to

constrain that property interest.

11

operating as an enterprise not because it has the label

"enterprise," but because this is a business and as a

do what a Wal-Mart or any other company could do to
