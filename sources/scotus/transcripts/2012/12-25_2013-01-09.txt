ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GUERRA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The DPPA requires express consent when personal

11

information in the DMV databases is used for bulk

12

solicitation.

13

Congress's considered response to one of the core

14

problems that the DPPA targets, and the litigation

15

exception creates no exception for lawyers.

16
17
18

The express consent requirement is

In fact, when Congress intended to create an
explicit exception -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does it create an

19

exception for research?

Let's assume that a university

20

wanted to do a research project, and it needs subjects.

21

I get solicited for it all the time.

22

Does this exception apply to them, too?

23

MR. GUERRA:

Our view, Your Honor, as we

24

indicated in our reply brief, is it would not because we

25

believe (b)(12)'s consent requirement governs commercial
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bulk use of DMV information, which is clear from the

2

fact that it's focusing on marketing and solicitation

3

and also from the history behind the statute, which is

4

very much aimed at use of DMV information --

5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
just marketing or solicitations.

7
8

It says, "surveys," not

MR. GUERRA:

Yes, it does, Justice

Sotomayor.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, there is a

10

commercial component, but there appears to be a

11

noncommercial component as well.

12

MR. GUERRA:

We -- we think, Justice

13

Sotomayor, that this statute is sensibly construed to --

14

under the noscitur a sociis principle that we are

15

relying on elsewhere in our argument with respect to

16

(b)(4).

17

things that -- that the bulk solicitation -- the bulk

18

use provision governs and, particularly, when you look

19

at the history underlying the statute which was very

20

much aimed at use of the information for direct

21

marketing.

22
23
24
25

That that same principle applies to the three

And so -- as I was saying, Congress made
clear -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Does that apply to the

States, too, when they want to market against drunk

2

insurance processes versus private processes for State

3

drug provided --

4

MR. GUERRA:

Justice Sotomayor, I believe

5

what your first question sounded -- your first example

6

sounded like it was a noncommercial use.

7

in the -- in the case where the State is acting as a

8

commercial entity, the same rules we would -- we would

9

apply with respect to lawyer solicitation would apply

10
11

I think that

there.
And the reason I say that -- and the reason

12

I think it's so clear that Congress intended that really

13

lies in the language of Subsection (b)(2) because,

14

there, Congress made clear that it understood that these

15

provisions are not wholly independent permissions and,

16

in fact, that the consent requirement governs all

17

commercial bulk use, absent an explicit exception.

18

And, if you take a look, it's in the second

19

page of the addendum to our opening brief.

20

that, "Personal information may be used in connection

21

with matters of motor vehicle market research activity,

22

including survey research."

23

And it says

Congress included the survey research clause

24

because a commercial bulk survey using personal

25

information would otherwise be governed by (b)(12)'s
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

consent requirement, and so Congress had to make clear

2

that it was creating an exception for one industry to

3

engage in this one particular type of bulk use.

4

And the reason we know that the survey

5

research clause means that is because, under

6

Respondent's interpretation, it has no affect

7

whatsoever.

8

clauses is wholly independent and sufficient to

9

authorize whatever it covers, a phrase covering "in

If -- if, as they say, each of these

10

connection with matters of motor vehicle market research

11

activities" would, in and of itself, cover the subset of

12

motor vehicle market research survey research.

13

So to give that clause any effect, you must

14

understand that it's overriding the express consent

15

requirement of (b)(12) and -- such that you now have to,

16

when you look at the other provisions that might

17

authorize bulk commercial use, find a comparably

18

explicit authorization, and you can't find that in

19

(b)(4).

20

less bulk solicitation.

21
22

(B)(4) says nothing about solicitation, much
And --

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

23

MR. GUERRA:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

It says, "anticipation of

Yes.
Not only ongoing

litigation, but it can be used in connection with
6
Alderson Reporting Company

2

anticipation of litigation.
MR. GUERRA:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

But my

3

point is that, in (b)(2), you find an explicit

4

authorization for survey research, which is one of the

5

very three topics covered in (b)(12) itself.

6

look at (b)(4), you don't see anything about

7

solicitation, which is the kind of explicit override

8

that (b)(2) indicates Congress wanted or -- or is

9

necessary in order to conclude that another subsection

10
11

When you

overrides (b)(12)'s express consent requirement.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- Mr. Guerra, I have to

12

admit that, given what a mess this statute is, those

13

three words don't quite do it for me.

14

the -- the argument against you, right, is -- as to

15

using (b)(12) to define (b)(4), is that, look, this is

16

just a list of exceptions to a general prohibition, and

17

no one is more general or specific than any other, and

18

all you have to do is fit within one of them.

19

doesn't matter whether you don't fit within two of them,

20

if you don't fit within one of them.

21

So then the question would be:

22

covered by (b)(4) or not?

23

(b)(12) or not?

24
25

So, I mean,

MR. GUERRA:

And it

Are you

If not, are you covered by

Well, Justice Kagan, with

respect, number one, I don't think you can so readily
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dismiss the -- the interpretive import of those three

2

words because they don't have any function other than to

3

override the express consent requirement in (b)(12).

4

And, if there is no need -- if (b)(12) doesn't apply to

5

any other subsection, there is no need to be overriding

6

it in (b)(2).

7

But we don't rely solely on that -- the

8

force of those three words.

It's also the case that

9

(b)(2) -- excuse me, (b)(12) is one of the core

10

provisions of the statute, in the sense that it's aimed

11

at one of the fundamental problems that prompted passage

12

of the Act in the first place, which was DMVs collecting

13

information, then making it available to direct

14

marketers.

15
16
17

And so you are in a situation where you've
got a core restriction aimed at a core problem this
Statute

18

is designed to -- to resolve, but -- whereas (b)(4) is

19

one of the few subsections that authorize access to the

20

most sensitive information that Congress -- excuse me,

21

that DMVs were -- were collecting.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's kind of hard to

23

argue, when you have (b)s (1) through (14), that (b)(12)

24

is the core provision.

25

items in a list.

26

MR. GUERRA:

Usually, it's -- it's 1 of 14

Mr. Chief Justice, what I mean
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

by that is that we know it's -- it's core in the sense

2

that it's aimed at one of the core problems that

3

Congress was addressing.

4

one of the few provisions in which Congress authorized

5

access to the most sensitive information DMVs collect,

6

such as medical and disability status and Social

7

Security numbers.

8
9

And (b)(4), by contrast, is

And we submit it's simply implausible to
think that a Congress concerned with undue

10

public/private access to DMV information would, in the

11

same statute, grant lawyers the right -- a unique right,

12

to use that highly sensitive information in order to

13

engage in bulk solicitation.

14

And, in fact, the legislative record here is

15

devoid of any evidence that Congress was aware that

16

lawyers ever made use of DMV information for

17

solicitation, much less that -- or that they

18

contemplated it, much less that Congress made a

19

conscious decision to allow them to --

20

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you recognize that you

could use (b)(4) to identify class members?
MR. GUERRA:

We do, Your Honor.

And -- and

23

that's -- that is because that is not a solicitation.

24

That class notice is advising people who are not aware

25

that there is pending litigation that could affect their
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

rights.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- so if it's -- if

3

it's a solicitation, suppose this information was a -- the

4

recent automobile purchaser was asked:

11

Were you charged this additional fee?

That would be okay?
MR. GUERRA:

Your Honor, yes.

It would be

okay -- well, let me just say if -- if the person --

9
10

Did you buy a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would come under

(b)(4)?
MR. GUERRA:

Justice Ginsburg, if I may just

12

qualify my answer, yes, if you were investigating claims

13

on behalf of a potential client.

14

don't think people can just go down to the DMV and

15

answer questions of personal interests to themselves --

16

or lawyers, for that matter.

17

which you are simply engaging in investigation, assuming

18

that you are investigating a possible lawsuit, and not a

19

circumstance in which you are engaging in solicitation.

20

And that is a fundamental difference.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I don't think -- I

But that is an instance in

Well, aren't we going to

22

be told the whole essence of the class action is you

23

isn't this investigation in anticipation?

1

MR. GUERRA:

Your Honor -- Justice Kennedy,

2

if they had limited their activities to conducting an

3

investigation, to determine the scope of a potential

4

claim, we would have no quarrel with that.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

are -- are you willing to join the class?

7

MR. GUERRA:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MR. GUERRA:

Well, the anticipation is,

But that -Isn't that critical?

No -- no, Justice Kennedy, I

10

don't think so.

11

focused on proceedings, not on lawyers.

12

asking -- its basic goal is to ensure that tribunals can

13

do their job.

14

And I think the point of (b)(4) is it's

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And it's

Well, I do think you are

15

helped somewhat by the -- the chronological progression

16

here, is it including the service of process, which

17

means the case has already started, and then

18

investigation in anticipation of the litigation that

19

follows the service of process.

20

So it -- it is true that there is a

21

chronological aspect.

22

Respondents to prevail, they have to say that

23

investigation in anticipation of litigation also

24

precedes service of process.

25

MR. GUERRA:

In order, it seems to me, for the

They would, and I think they do
11

Alderson Reporting Company

1

make that argument, Justice Kennedy.

2

the focus of (b)(4) is on the tribunals, in ensuring

3

that they have -- they can have the information, that

4

they can do their job, which is to make and enforce

5

judgments.

6

they act as officers of these tribunals, not for their

7

own commercial benefit.

8
9

My point is that

Lawyers get information under (b)(4) when

When --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Guerra, where do you get

that from, in (b)(4), this focus on tribunals, rather

10

than lawyers?

11

investigation is done by lawyers, right?

12

critical part of (b)(4), so where -- where does that

13

come from in the statute?

14

Because -- you know, the -- the

MR. GUERRA:

And that's a

It comes from the phrase "for

15

use in connection with any civil, criminal,

16

administrative or arbitral proceeding in any Federal,

17

State, or local court or agency."

18
19
20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And --

But then it includes things

that are clearly done by lawyers.
MR. GUERRA:

Right.

My point is that

21

lawyers get access when they act as officers of those

22

tribunals, not for their own commercial self-interests.

23

And an investigation in anticipation of litigation is an

24

obligation that all lawyers have, to ensure that they

25

have a well-founded factual basis for bringing a lawsuit
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in the first instance.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, are -- are you

3

saying that the study must be either a solicitation or

4

an investigation?

5

both?

6

It can't be both?

MR. GUERRA:

Why can't it be

Because, Justice Kennedy, the

7

DM -- the DPPA is designed to -- it was aiming at a

8

fundamental problem of private individuals obtaining DMV

9

information for commercial solicitation purposes.

And

10

Congress, we know, wanted to stop that in the absence

11

of consent.

12

make sure that they weren't intruding on the information

13

that courts and other tribunals need to do their jobs.

14

So -- by the same token, they wanted to

And so the -- the distinction is you can

15

engage in an investigation because that's acting as an

16

officer of the court, in order to help the court

17

ultimately render its judgment.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's why -- would

you -- I want to make sure I understood your prior

20

answer.

21

okay to get the information from the bureau and then

22

ask, did you buy a car recently?

2

vital distinction is between investigative activity to

3

ensure that you have a well-founded basis to file a

4

lawsuit, versus solicitation --

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

Well, isn't that --

6

wasn't that crystal-clear here?

Because the dealers

7

were saying, you can't go forward unless you have a

8

plaintiff to match every dealer.

purchased from a list of defendants.

14

MR. GUERRA:

So we are

Justice Ginsburg, determining

15

that there are -- there are enough plaintiffs to justify

16

a class or group action is the -- the investigative

17

activity, but, when you go on to invite them -- and the

Fourth Circuit ruled that these letters were

solicitations, and that ruling is not before this Court

charge, then calls the lawyer's office and says, tell me

7

something about this letter that you told me -- that

8

you -- you sent to me.

9

But somebody who receives this

And how does the lawyer answer?
MR. GUERRA:

10

If the lawyer answers by asking

11

investigative questions, when did you buy the car, were

12

you charged these fees, were -- were you advised, were

13

they prominently displayed, all of which is in gathering

14

information for the lawsuit, then the lawyer is engaging

15

in permissible investigative prefiling activity --

more -- did you buy a car, did you get charged the fee,

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And --

So what's the difference

3

between that and how you answered Justice Ginsburg, when

4

she said class notice would be okay?

5

MR. GUERRA:

Because class notice is not a

6

proposal of a -- of a relation -- a commercial

7

transaction.

8
9

It is noticed -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Wait a minute.

It's

joining the class or opting out.

10

MR. GUERRA:

Correct.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, when you join the

12

class, you have a commercial relationship with the

13

lawyer no different than being a named plaintiff.

14

MR. GUERRA:

But the function of class

15

notice is not to enable class lawyers to solicit

16

clients.

17

judgments and to satisfy due process requirements, so

18

that people unaware of a litigation do not have their

19

rights forfeited.

20

than -- than soliciting clients.

It is to enable courts to render binding

That is fundamentally different

21

And I realize that --

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Guerra, that

23

distinction -- I understand that you are deriving some

24

of it from (b)(12), but if I -- just -- just assume with

25

me that (b)(12) has nothing to do with anything, and you
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were just limited to (b)(4), can you find that

2

distinction in (b)(4)?

3

MR. GUERRA:

Your Honor, I think the point

4

here is that, if you look at the conduct that is

5

specified in the three examples, it is all activity that

6

lawyers would be engaging in as officers of a court.

7

And this Court has repeatedly recognized that there is a

8

fundamental difference between lawyers acting in their

9

own commercial capacities, as opposed to officers of a

10

court.

11

And --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How -- how is

13

somebody conducting an investigation in anticipation of

14

litigation -- it hasn't started yet -- acting as an

15

officer of the court?

16

MR. GUERRA:

Because they're discharging

17

their responsibility to ensure that they bring

18

well-founded claims and don't file suits without -- I

19

mean, under Rule 11, you have to have a well-founded

20

factual basis for the allegations in the complaint.

21

So you need to do --

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that just

23

seems to me to be saying a lawyer is always acting

24

as an officer of the court.

I mean, tell me where that distinction is in
this -- in this provision.
MR. GUERRA:

Well, Justice Kagan, for one

thing, I think that, even if you decide that (b)(12) is
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

not governing (b) -- (b)(4), it's still part of the

2

statute.

3

concerned about people using DMV information in order to

4

engage in commercial activity.

5

And it still demonstrates that Congress was

And so the question then is, here's (b)(4),

6

which says, we're authorizing use of information for use

7

in tribunals.

8

so the question is -- and this provision authorizes use

9

of the most sensitive information that -- that DMVs

10
11

There's no mention of lawyers here.

And

collect.
So the question you have to ask yourself is:

12

In light of (b)(12) and the fact that we know Congress

13

was trying to stop use of DMV information for

14

non-consensual solicitations, is it reasonable to think

15

that this clause authorizes lawyers to use disability

16

status and medical information in order to go find and

17

solicit clients?

18

And I submit it is not, particularly if you

19

take the same broad reading that the Respondents argue

20

for, the "in connection with" language, and you apply

21

that to (b)(6) and (b)(10), then you have these truly

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I understand

your argument about (12), but I -- I do think that you

5

ought to assume we might interpret this statute, so that

6

each of these is independent, and you have to

7

concentrate on (4).

8

we're talking about (4).

9

You keep going back to (12), when

If you talk about (4) for a minute, it seems

10

to me that you might give away too much because the

11

statute says, "including service of process," which

12

means the suit has to begin and then investigation in

13

anticipation of the litigation that will follow after

14

that suit has come in.

But you seem to give that away.

can be before the suit is filed.

to think that the phrase "in connection with" should be

be shown to have a connection with the subject matter.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You -- you said earlier,

and it set me to thinking, that why would in

anticipation of litigation permit access to all of this

very personal information?

21

it does permit access, but only in anticipation of

22

litigation.

23

like Social Security number, driver -- anything else --

24

all they asked for was name and addresses, I understand.

25

And I don't know that, yes,

So you have to prove, before you get things

MR. GUERRA:

Justice Sotomayor, that's true
21

in this case, but if you -- if you read before, the way

2

Respondents are asking you to read it, there's no

3

limitation in the statute that says you can specify --

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, yes, there is.

5

There is a limitation that you're actually going to use

6

it in relationship to the litigation, number one.

7

the States are obligated to ensure that what they

8

release is actually covered by one of these exceptions.

9

MR. GUERRA:

And

If you interpret (b)(4) to

10

authorize access by lawyers in connection -- based on

11

the theory that they are -- it's in connection with some

litigation, they will have access --

why.

1

The four requests that followed after the first two said

2

nothing of the sort, and the State gave me information.

3

It just said pursuant to the subsection that we're

4

talking about right now.

5

In addition, there is no reason why lawyers

6

couldn't go in and say, I would like to identify -- I am

7

investigating whether people have claims for a

8

disability claims or -- or based on their medical

9

status, and I would like information of that ilk from --

from the DMV.

12

there has to be some heightened showing by -- by the

Mr. Guerra, suppose I am a

23

MR. GUERRA:

And so I put out a

Would -- would that

The

24

first is that you have highlighted why this is such a

25

unique loophole for one very discrete class of lawyers.

1

Most -- toxic tort lawyers cannot go to a DMV and say, I

2

need the names and address of people.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess what I was

4

suggesting was that, if I was just asking for witnesses,

5

you would have to say that that was included by (b)(4);

6

is that right?

7

MR. GUERRA:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

I do.

I do acknowledge that.

So, now, the court -- the

lawyer is saying, in addition to your help as a witness,

10

if you have the same symptoms -- you know, you can join

11

the suit.

12

MR. GUERRA:

And I think that that's an

13

improper use.

The Congress did not create this

14

authorization to go down to get the most sensitive

15

information in order to enable lawyers to find clients

16

more easily than they might otherwise find them.

17

investigation in anticipation of litigation is one use

18

that Congress authorized, and, as I have suggested, it's

19

a use that helps a lawyer discharge his or her

20

responsibility to a court.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I don't know why this

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

13
14
15

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The DPPA is an unusual statute.

It directly

16

regulates the State's use of their own databases and

17

imposes massive civil liability and criminal penalties

18

for violations.

19

distinct way, which is it makes disclosures

20

presumptively unlawful, but then has 14 permissible use

21

provisions for which the State may, but does not must,

22

may disclose the information.

23

It regulates it in a relatively

The scope of those 14 permissible use

24

provisions then becomes quite important for determining

25

whether or not a statute that was originally designed
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

primarily to regulate the commercial sale of DMV

2

information becomes intrusive into matters of

3

traditional State regulation or imposes massive

4

liability without the requisite clarity.

5

Now, I would have thought that it was fairly

6

clear that, but for a resort to the specific controls to

7

the general canon, that all of the activity at issue

8

here comes comfortably within the language of (b)(4)

9

because, if you look at that language, it is remarkably

10

broad.

Congress uses the word "any" three times.

11

uses "in connection with," which I think we all know is

12

a term of breadth.

13

uses illustrative examples.

14

It

And then it uses "including" and

And I think the only thing that really

15

brings these examples together is Congress seems to be

16

covering the litigation process from cradle to grave.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One thing we also

18

know about the "in connection with" language is that we

19

have said, it can't really mean "in connection with," as

20

broadly as that -- the Morales case, I guess, it has to

21

have a more narrow meaning.

22

be covered.

23

MR. CLEMENT:

Otherwise, everything would

Mr. Chief Justice, that's

24

exactly right.

But the whole reason it has to have

25

some limit is because it's presumptively quite broad.
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And if -- I mean, for those who look at legislative

2

history, the evolution of this provision, as it -- it

3

was changed twice in the legislative process.

4

And it started out that Congress was going

5

to have a permissible use just for use in litigation

6

involving motor vehicles.

7

vehicles" and just said, "use in litigation."

8

in the final iteration, they said, "use in connection

9

with litigation."

10
11

Then they dropped "motor
And then,

So, clearly, they were trying to

broaden it.
Now, I -- I would be the first to admit that

12

there has to be some limit, and we certainly wouldn't

13

say, for example, that if lawyers -- you know, decide in

14

this case, well -- you know, we got this DMV information

15

for perfectly legitimate purposes involved in a

16

litigation, but, now, we are sitting on a gold mine, so

17

we should try to sell -- sell these same people floor

18

mats or wiper blades or something.

19

they can't do that.

20

I mean, of course,

So there are limits, but I think --

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can they do this:

Can --

21

can Lawyer Smith say -- you know, there are some

22

products in this State that I really suspect are not

23

being properly made, and I have probably a tort suit;

24

and the damages are awfully small; I would like to get

25

10 or 20,000 plaintiffs.

I wonder if there is anybody
29

Alderson Reporting Company

1

interested?

2

And then what he does is -- I have to write

3

them a letter, and I know where I can get the names and

4

addresses, from the DMV.

5

So he goes to the DMV and says, I would like

6

the names of everybody who -- I'd like all your names

7

and addresses, and I intend to write them all and send

8

them a letter and say, I suspect there is some fishy

9

business going on here in the dress manufacturers; would

10

you like to tell me about what happened?

But can I say something before

we talk about that?

17

to go after the dress manufacturers --

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

-- they can go to the phone

20

book, they can go to the title records office, there is

21

lots of places they can go, if what they want is just

22

general information about people.

7

they want the names of all the people who've ever had a

8

9

special about a car, and they think that's going to be

10

connected.

MR. CLEMENT:

I --

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have no lawsuit, but

13

you are going to get one if you can, and you have

14

grounds for thinking that there is some suspicious

15

defendants, and what you are looking for is plaintiffs.

answer, at the end of the day, is it depends on whether

defendants, what he's saying is, these lawyers had no

Well -And as to some of these,

Mr. Chief Justice, which is why the line can't really be

16

between investigation in anticipation of litigation and

17

solicitation in anticipation of litigation because that

18

is too thin a line to make a $200 million difference.

19
20
21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So where -- where is

the line?
MR. CLEMENT:

The line is whether or not it

22

is in anticipation of litigation or in connection with

23

litigation --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, that's the

figure out what they mean.

2

type of solicitation that the statute was meant to

3

prohibit, how do you draw a line that prohibits that,

4

but allows the sort of thing that you want to do?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

If you think there is some

I think the way you do is you

6

would basically say that, when they are saying, "in

7

anticipation of litigation," they mean in anticipation

of a particular litigation, particular problem, and so

it's different -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That doesn't have to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- residing in the

brain of any lawyer who's looking for work.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

They are -- they are

17

concerned about a particular thing, and I think the "in

18

anticipation of litigation" language, I mean, that's not

19

the only time you have ever seen it before -JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

It's not just that

21

language.

It's "investigation in anticipation of

22

litigation."

23

saying investigation includes solicitation.

If I understand you correctly, you are

24

MR. CLEMENT:

It --

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Isn't that your position?

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it is, though I guess

2

my point would be, even if you can identify some

3

solicitation that is not investigation, as long as it's

4

in connection with litigation, it's in (b)(4), and then

5

I think --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So you are saying

7

that really this is a -- the way the statute works is it

8

says nobody can solicit, but for lawyers.

9

not -- that makes more sense than you might think

And that's

10

because this was not a statute that was meant to

11

interfere with solicitation rules; it was meant to

12

interfere with commercial selling.

13

And -- and that's what this is about, and

14

there is a requirement, the requirement as to the

15

lawyer, in good faith, has to believe that, if he finds

16

a client, there's a case.

17
18

MR. CLEMENT:

I agree with everything,

except the first thing you said --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. CLEMENT:

All right.

-- which is that this is a

21

prohibition on solicitation.

If you look at the

22

structure of the statute, it says, presumptively, you

23

can't use this for anything.

24

permissions.

25

are unconditional.

And then there are 14

And some of the permissions, like (b)(4),
If you come within (b)(4), you get
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to use it.

2

Now, when you get to the end of the statute,

3

which is -- I respectfully suggest is not where you put

4

the core provisions, it's where you put the less favored

5

provisions -- then you have, in (b)(12), a conditional

6

permission that you can use it, but only if you get

7

consent.

8
9

Now, the thrust of their position is, if you
are in one of the unconditional permissions, but you

10

also are, presumptively, in one of the conditional

11

permissions, somehow, that condition from (b)(12) hops

12

over to (b)(12) -- (b)(4) and says --

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't -- I don't think

14

that is fair.

15

(b)(4) and (b)(12), you have to interpret investigation,

16

not to include solicitation, because, otherwise, you

17

have a conflict, that (b)(12) prohibits solicitation,

18

unless you have the consent; whereas, (b)(4), which

19

says, "investigation," does not require consent.

20

I think their position is, to harmonize

Now, the two exist in perfect harmony if

21

investigation does not include solicitation, but

22

there -- there is a discrepancy between the two if it

23

does include solicitation.

24

this is an exception from (b)(12).

25

MR. CLEMENT:

And you have to say, well,

No, you don't.

Alderson Reporting Company

There is no

4

with litigation, you're covered by both, you take the

5

green light, there is no conflict.

6

A conditional -- like you get a green
You get a yellow light for

If you have solicitation in connection

And the premise for your discussion was we

7

have to harmonize.

I would take issue with that.

8

you look at these 14 exemptions, there is tons of

9

overlap in them.

If

Congress is not telling you that each

10

of these 14 exceptions has an exclusive area, and you

11

have to find out which field is preempted by (1), (2),

12

(3), (4), (5), (6), (7).

13

(b)(4), there is complete overlap.

14

If you look at (b)(1) and

One of the things I would take issue with is

15

my brother said that, well, (b)(4) is about the

16

tribunal.

17

the tribunal.

18

government actors and their functions, and it

19

specifically talks about torts.

20

No, it's not.

(B)(1) is principally about

(B)(1) is the provision that talks about

JUSTICE ALITO:

(B)(4) is about -- (b)(4) is

21

about very sensitive information.

You're talking about

22

people's Social Security numbers.

You're talking about

want to disclose to the general public -- a person has

1

And so you're just -- you're saying lawyers,

2

they -- they get all that stuff.

3

lawyers are a privileged class, and they get it.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

Nobody else can, but

Justice Alito, it is important

5

to recognize lawyers presumptively get it under Federal

6

law, but Federal law is only a floor.

7

Social Security numbers, please, because, sure, as to

8

(b)(4) and (b)(1) and two other provisions, Congress

9

says, presumptively, you can get Social Security

You know what -- you know what State -- the

18

You never get Social
They

And so that is

They don't have

And, to Justice Breyer's point, it makes

19

sense that you would distinguish between an attorney who

20

is subject to the Bar discipline, is subject to

21

oversight and solicitation process, and treat that

22

solicitation differently from a solicitation by a direct

23

marketer, which is what (b)(12) is clearly aimed at, not

24

the practice of law.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

The difficulty that

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Justice Alito brings out is -- I see your

2

interpretation, and I hope the other side will give me

3

some line because they have the same problem -- you

4

know, but in reverse.

5

What is the line?

But your way, it doesn't become that much of

6

a privacy statute.

7

it's a statute that is designed to prevent the

8

commercial use of your -- of this personal information.

9

It's not really a privacy statute.

10

It's sort of a misnomer.

MR. CLEMENT:

It's a --

It's certainly not an

11

all-purpose privacy statute.

12

And the principal thing that they were concerned about,

13

of course, is that you could look at somebody's license

14

plate and indiscriminately go down, pay a fee, and get

15

their home address.

16

I do think that's fair.

Now, the one thing we know from (b)(4) is,

17

if a lawyer wants to do that exact thing, to serve

18

process, the lawyer gets to do it.

19

somebody's license plate, go to the DMV, get an address,

20

and serve process.

21

So we know, as to the core of the statute, they treated

22

lawyers differently.

23

You can get

And they specifically preserve that.

They were also concerned with direct

24

marketers taking this information and using it to market

25

people, but I don't think you'd lump lawyer solicitation
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in anticipation of litigation, which may put some limit

2

on it, together with that.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in anticipation of

4

litigation does come after service of process, and an

5

additional way to harmonize this statute with (12) is to

6

say that, after the suit has been filed, then -- in

7

anticipation of the litigation that that suit will

8

engender, then you may get the information.

9

didn't do that.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

But you

There's two problems with that

11

way of looking at the statute, I think I would

12

respectfully suggest, Justice Kennedy.

13

talking about items on an inclusive list, so even if you

14

took your premise that -- that the anticipation of

15

litigation in that list somehow is anticipation post

16

service of process -- which I want to come back to --

17

even if you took that position, they are just things on

18

an inclusive list.

19

saying that the ultimate test here is whether it's in

20

connection with litigation.

21

One is we are

And so it wouldn't stop you from

But I guess I would go back to that and say

22

I've never once thought that investigation in

23

anticipation of litigation was something that would take

24

place after service of process.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought -- I mean --

That's the way the

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

statute's written.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, but I don't think that

3

that was an intentional thing on the Court's part, that

4

we're going to name these and we're going to name them

5

in chronological order.

6

they got it wrong.

7

If they tried to do it, I think

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, I'm not

8

sure I'm satisfied with the answer you gave to

9

Justice Scalia.

He said, look, we've got to harmonize;

10

instead of general-specific, solicitation of clients is

11

different than investigation, and we just say they're

12

mutually exclusive.

13

specific.

14

(b)(2) wants to permit solicitation, it expressly says

15

it, and they didn't expressly say, "solicitation," in

16

(4).

17

It is a little bit of a general and

And that's proven by (b)(2) because, when

argument.

independent, but why are they necessarily conflicting?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're saying they're

Last word "conflicting"?
"Conflicting," exactly,

23

Alderson Reporting Company

they necessarily overlapping?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

I think they are necessarily

3

overlapping, and I guess I would point to several

4

things.

5

think helps them nearly as much as they do.

6

that language in there about survey research, like much

7

language in many statutes, maybe avoids the marketers --

8

or the -- the motor vehicle marketers from having to be

9

here in a lawsuit because it removes all doubt about it.

First of all, the language in (b)(2), I don't
I think

10

But I think they would be covered, even without those

11

words.

12

But the point is -- you may say, well,

13

that's horrible, that's superfluous.

14

look at the way the statute operates generally, there's

15

lots of overlap.

16

to make sure that there is no overlap and everyone

17

operates independently.

18

But, no, if you

covered by (b)(4).

2

Okay.

When you're pursuing that legal

remedy pursuant to (b)(3), you're also doing things in

connection with litigation pursuant to --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that's --

6

well, that's right.

7

is -- they're not separate categories, and there's no

8

overlap.

9

is we have to give some limiting construction to "in

connection with."
And it seems to me that, if you are involved

12

in that endeavor, it does make sense to see how what

13

you're going to cover under the "in connection with"

14

relates to what's exempt under the other provisions.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

But, as we've discussed,

16

Mr. Chief Justice, if you -- if you are saying you are

17

not going to apply the specific controls the general,

18

but you may be using a junior varsity version of it to

19

harmonize the statute --

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly.

-- as -- as we suggested in

22

our colloquy, I think the line between solicitation in

23

anticipation of litigation and investigation in

24

anticipation is far too thin a line to

25

make a $200 million difference.

And if I could direct the Court to page 93

2

of the Joint Appendix because that will show you just an

3

example of the postcard that is attached to these

4

letters.

5

Justice Ginsburg was suggesting -- again, this is at 93

6

of the Joint Appendix -- it asks people to fill out

7

their name, address, the dealership they bought the car

8

from, the type of car, and then the administrative fee

9

or processing fee that was charged.

And the postcard does ask specifically, as

10

Now, I think it's common ground between the

11

parties that we get to ask about that administrative or

12

processing fee because that is investigation in

13

anticipation of the -- of the litigation.

14

understand where my clients arguably made a $200 million

15

mistake is by adding the line "I'm interested" -- "I am

16

interested in participating" signature, that crosses the

17

line into solicitation.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

As I

Well, the reason -- the

19

reason that would be so -- I agree with you, that it's

20

very hard to figure out what the line is here between

21

the investigation and solicitation.

22

But that's where the solicitation thing

23

comes into play because what it -- the words that go the

24

other way, in my mind, that cut against you, is that

25

this card could have asked for Social Security numbers,

All right.

Not under South Carolina

But then, under another State, under
Now, that's helpful, that

But if -- when I think of asking for Social
Security numbers, I -- the words -- exaggerated, but

10

they go through my mind -- are "identity theft run

11

wild."

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, if that is a

14

concern -- if that is a concern, then, by reading this

15

as a solicitation -- you know, the pure case -- and

16

throwing the other exception to cover it, you force the

17

State to focus on it.

18

And the State then has to decide whether

19

they are going to permit or not permit the solicitor,

20

who -- you see, might -- might include the lawyer here,

21

to ask for the Social Security number, and better to

22

have them focus on that decision.

23

that I see between the two.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

That's the connection

But, Justice Breyer, let me

try to help you this way, which, is first of all, every

2

the only circumstances in which I can imagine a State

ever giving Social Security numbers to a lawyer is if

5

putting the Social Security numbers on the forms and we

are --

And

So are we -- do we

know -- by the way, that is helpful because do we know

under how many States' law the DMV would be forbidden to

give Social Security numbers?
MR. CLEMENT:

12

can get that to you in a supplemental letter.

And -Well, if Congress wanted to

MR. CLEMENT:

when it uses "in anticipation of litigation," it

which is, to the extent you're going to resort to the

6

specific controls of the general, I think it is worth

7

noting that this would be the first time, that I'm aware

8

of, that the Court would ever have applied that canon to

9

impose this kind of massive civil liability and even

10

potentially criminal liability.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't know which is

12

specific and which is general.

13

problem I have with that.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, that's the

I agree, and I think that's

15

the best reason why the canon doesn't work.

16

equally specific.

17

between the two that you have here -- and you have in

18

(b)(1) and (b)(4) and (b)(3) and (b)(4) -- you just say,

19

okay, Congress thought it was okay, and you just call it

20

a day.

21

These are

And, in the case of an overlap

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what you say,

22

Mr. Clement, that you and your varsity version of the --

23

which is stronger than the other one is --

24

MR. CLEMENT:

Paradoxically.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- is something like, if

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

(b)(4) is hard, we have to draw a line someplace, we can

2

look to (b)(12) as expressing some kind of concern that

3

we can use to draw that line.

4
5

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah.

And the reason I think

that --

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's not a conflict, we

7

don't have to -- you know, it's not inconsistent, it's

8

just this is an expression of what Congress was thinking

9

about, we're going to use it as a clue.
MR. CLEMENT:

10

Right.

But the line-drawing

11

problem is really drawing the line about "in connection

12

with."

13

between solicitation in anticipation of litigation and

14

investigation in -- in anticipation of litigation just

15

doesn't work.

16

The line-drawing problem -- drawing the line

They're two sides of the same coin.

As Justice Ginsburg pointed out, if my

17

clients had sent a letter that nobody objects to, that

18

says, we're bringing a lawsuit, we think you may have

19

been charged the same kind of fee, I think what the

20

State Bar would have said -- the natural next question

21

for anybody getting that letter is, will you represent

22

me?

23

want to treat this like it's solicitation, and we want

24

to add these additional bells and whistles.

25

And precisely because of that, we want you -- we

And part of the irony here is, I think, the
56
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

things that make our letter look most like it's

2

advertisement or solicitation are the things that are

3

required by the State Bar.

4

And, keep in mind, that's another reason why

5

treating attorney solicitation differently from general

6

solicitation makes perfect sense because they're subject

7

to --

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:
you're saying.

I don't understand what

You're saying the State Bar requirements

10

would have required you to say, are you interested in

11

joining the lawsuit?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, and -- they would --

13

it's so natural that somebody will say, can I join your

14

lawsuit --

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

-- that they would require all

17

the language that says, you have alternatives, other

18

people can -- can -- can hire you.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's because --

20

that's because the State is allowing solicitation, and

21

it puts certain conditions on what your solicitation --

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Exactly.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You point to page 94, you

24

say, oh, it's just the last line, the whole thrust of

25

the letter was solicitation.

You have to be fair about

that.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Exactly.
You have to be fair about

that.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

And, Justice Scalia, the last

6

thing you can infer from the statute is that Congress

7

wanted, for the first time ever, get in the business of

8

managing attorney solicitation, a subject they'd always

9

left to the States.

And --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

identified defect.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH R. GUERRA

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4

MR. GUERRA:

Thank you.

5

First of all, I'd just like to point out

6

that the consequence of Respondent's argument is that --

7

is they gave the example of going to get the license

8

plate and then getting the name and address to serve

9

process.
But, on their theory, you can also go down

10
11

and -- you can witness an accident on the side of the

12

road, you can go down to DMV, get the name and

13

license -- use the license plate to get the name and

14

address and send a solicitation letter.

16

And I think everybody -- as I understand it,

MR. GUERRA:

Our line is solicitation,

2

Justice Breyer, and there are two ways to get that.

3

There is the -- we -- I submit, is the strong textual

4

evidence in (b)(2), that Congress did, in fact,

5

understand that the consent requirement governs all bulk

6

solicitation or surveys or marketing, and it had to give

7

an explicit override in (b)(2) because, otherwise,

8

(b)(12) would have restricted the ability to do

In the middle of the -- in

They are missing a client.

And so can they get it then?

15

conclusion.

16

And, in fact, that's what most class

So that's not, to my mind, in Congress's

But I would just point out that, according

17

to Respondents, the phrase "survey research" is

18

surplusage, and this Court says that's -- you're not

19

supposed to reach that conclusion, if you can avoid it,

20

and you can avoid it by understanding it to be the

21

meaning -- the meaning -- its effect is to override the

22

consent requirement, so that -- that you can do

23

commercial bulk surveys in (b)(2), which would otherwise

24

require consent as a -- as a consequence of (b)(12).

25

And then there is the so-called "junior
61
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

varsity" harmonization basis for reaching solicitation.

2

And I would point out that Respondents are saying, it

3

can't be that you -- that some -- certain statements in

4

a letter means you crossed the line into solicitation

5

and that that has all kinds of massive civil liability

6

consequences.

7

Congress used the word "solicitation" in

8

this statute.

Congress meant to draw some kind of line

9

around solicitation.

Now, admittedly, we're saying that

10

the harmonization means that that's the same line you

11

would draw in (b)(4).

12

think that Congress was -- was drawing a line at

13

solicitation and that liability would flow, depending

14

upon whether somebody crossed it or not.

15

But it's not inconceivable to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Guerra, it didn't

16

draw the line at solicitation in (b)(4), and the

17

advantage of Mr. Clement's argument is that the line

18

that he sets up actually has a textual basis in (b)(4)

19

because it focuses on words like "what is a litigation,"

20

and "what is a proceeding," and "are we there yet."

21

that seems to be what the language of (b)(4) indicates.

22

MR. GUERRA:

And

Your Honor, our point is --

23

sort of, if you step back, and you -- and this is the

24

question for the harmonization purpose:

25

solicitation only because of the indeterminacy of the
62
Alderson Reporting Company

(b)(4) covers

Official

1

phrase "in connection with."

2

there's no basis for saying (b)(4) is authorizing

3

lawyers' solicitations.

4

the periphery of the authorization that (b)(4) provides.

5

Without that language,

So it is, I would submit, at

(B)(12) solicitation is at the core of what

6

that provision is about and that -- the -- the mass

7

marketing of using DMV information is one of the

8

fundamental problems Congress was addressing.

9

And I just think it's implausible to

10

conclude that the -- at the periphery concept in

11

(b)(4) should take precedence over the core function of

12

(b)(12).
