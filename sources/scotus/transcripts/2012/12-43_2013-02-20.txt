ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case has its origins in a decision by

12

the British government in the Major Thatcher years to

13

privatize a number of previously State-owned utilities.

14

The government's plan was to keep prices constant and

15

allow the companies to make profits by increasing

16

efficiencies and reducing costs.

17

period in which prices would be fixed would the prices

18

be re-jiggered and then savings passed on to the

19

consumers.

20

Only after an initial

Now, this, in practice, worked very well for

21

the companies.

They were able to increase their

22

efficiencies and cut costs to a greater extent than

23

people expected.

This was not, however, greeted as a

24

uniform success.

Instead, the opposition party

25

criticized this and said that the fat cats at the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

utility companies had earned too much and the

2

conservative government had made a mistake by valuing

3

the shares at IPO too cheaply.

4

And so they promised, as an express election

5

promise, to impose a tax on the excess profits of

6

privatized utilities.

7

on that promise and passed the Windfall Act --

8
9

And, when elected, they made good

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

See, I have a problem

with this argument because it assumes a way of looking

10

at this, but it's an assumption.

12

money, we want a part of that profit, or they paid too

13

little for what they got.

14

You can look at it in

You can look at it as they made too much

And that was the debate going on in

15

Congress.

Did they pay too little on the floatation

16

value?

17

government says -- rightly -- is whether you paid too

18

much or too little money depends on the value of the

19

company.

20

how much money has the company made?

Or did they make too much money?

21

And one of the factors that goes into that is

And so you always have to look at profits,

22

to some extent.

23

their way?

24
25

And what the

So what's wrong with looking at it

Why does it have to be your way?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it has to be my way

because of the way the specific tax was designed.

the first --

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, you can only do it

3

your way if you do what the amici says, which is to take

4

out from your simplified equation the fact that the

5

time -- the D element of your equation -- is constant.

6

You artificially freeze it the time at which they

7

operated.

8

with your equation.

9

Only by freezing that number can you come out

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Your Honor, we're not

10

artificially freezing the -- the number.

11

the D -- 1461 for almost every company -- is, itself,

12

part of the statute because they picked a period by

13

which they were going to measure the profit in

14

value-making terms.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The number --

But there was at least

16

two or three companies that had a very different period,

17

and they paid a huge amount, much further than their

18

gross profits.

the parties, that the way you applied this regulation is

3

to look at the tax in -- to use the regulatory phrase --

4

in the normal circumstances in which it applies.

5
6

One, I believe it's common ground between

So I believe it's common ground that you
ignore the outliers anyway.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you change the other

8

part of the equation -- or of the tax regulation, which

9

says it has to be true for all taxpayers.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

That particular

11

provision -- think of it as like a Clark v. Martinez

12

principle for taxes.

13

they're not.

14

interpreted to.

15

really interested in it, is the Exxon case, the tax

16

court, we cite it in both our briefs.

17

They either are creditable or

That's what that principle has been
The case you should look at, if you're

And, there, it was a situation where, again,

18

a British Excess Profits Tax, in the main, it was an

19

Excess Profits Tax on the companies that were developing

20

the North Sea oil field.

21

couple of companies that really hadn't gotten any oil

22

out, it applied very differently.

23

But, as the tax applied to a

And the tax court and the government in that

24

case both conceded, no, you look at the tax in its main

25

applications.

And in those main applications, everyone
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

concedes that this tax operates exactly like a

2

51.75 percent tax on profits above a threshold, a

3

threshold of 4/9ths of the floatation value.

4

And that is not an accident.

That's not

5

some kind of tricky math thing that somebody pulled up.

6

It's right there in the statute itself because --

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose everyone in the

8

case conceded that the purpose of this statute was to

9

compensate the government for having valued the shares

10

at too low a price, and this was stated right in the

11

enactment.

12

Would that change your argument?
MR. CLEMENT:

It wouldn't, Justice Kennedy,

13

because, at the end of the day, it's the substance of

14

the tax, not its purpose behind it that matters.

15

do think, in this case, as Justice Sotomayor alluded to,

16

everybody in this process really understood that those

17

were just the flip side of the same coin.

18

Now, I

You can talk about the profits being too

19

high, vis-à-vis floatation, you can talk about

20

floatation being too low vis-à-vis the subsequently

21

reported profits, but what makes --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose we think

23

this is both a tax on profits and a tax on low value.

24

Then what do we do?

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, in this particular case,
7

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you would say it's creditable because the only measure

2

of value here is by looking at retrospective earnings

3

over a 4-year period.

4

give you is think about a foreign government that says

5

we want to tax the value of corporations, but the way we

6

are idiosyncratically going to measure value is to look

7

at their earnings over the past year.
Now, I would hope that tax would be for U.S.

8
9

And the best hypothetical I can

substantive economic tax purposes fully creditable.

Of

10

course, it's a tax on income, by our eyes.

Now, in

11

saying that, you're not suggesting that the other company --

12

the other country did something wrong or that's not value in

13

their conception.
But the whole point that this Court made

14
15

clear in the Biddle case, going back 75 years ago, is

16

when you're looking at foreign taxes, for purposes of

17

applying the foreign tax credit, you don't take the

18

foreign characterizations, the foreign classifications,

19

as a given.

20

our purposes.

21

You look at the substance of the tax for

And, if you look -- if you apply that

22

mechanism to this tax, this tax looks exactly like a

23

U.S. Excess Profits Tax.

It is really --

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Clement, if I -Suppose it's a one -- if I

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

could just -- suppose -- we say, well, this is a

2

one-time tax, in order to recalculate, reassess the

3

value.

4

Tax, in your view?

5

If it's on income, it's still an Excess Profits

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

And, of course, you

6

could have had a one-time, one-off tax, to use the

7

British phrase, and you could have taxed the difference

8

between the value at floatation and -- let's say the

9

London Stock Exchange price at some later point.

And

10

that would have been a normal estimate of value, and it

11

would not have been creditable for a number of reasons.

12

But when you do what this tax uniquely did,

13

which is you don't look at a normal rubric of value, but

14

you look at a construct -- I mean, the very fact that

15

they had to use the phrase "value in profit-making

16

terms" tells you something weird's going on here.

17

mean, if they were really --

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Mr. Clement, is there

19

another example -- Justice Kennedy mentioned that this

20

was what they call "one-off."

21

it's retrospective.

22

which a foreign tax credit has been given to something

23

that looks like this, a one-time only adjustment that

24

is -- that operates retrospectively on past earnings?

25

It's one time only, and

Is -- is there any instance in

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Ginsburg, I can't put
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all the pieces of that together and say there's one case

2

that had all of these various features, and then it was

3

still creditable, but I don't think that matters.

4

very clear, I think, for starters, that the fact that

5

this is a retroactive tax is not dispositive.

6

You look at one of the regulatory

It's

7

requirements, and that's realization.

And that treats

8

an estimate of future income generation very differently

9

because that doesn't involve a realization event.

10

what the regulation says is that the tax has to be

11

imposed upon or subsequent to.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

My fear is, as warned by

13

the government and the tax professors, that the rule you

14

want us to announce to help you win is to say anytime a

15

tax uses estimates of profits, no matter how it does it,

16

it is credible -- creditable.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

That's the rule you want.

No, it is not.

It is

18

emphatically not.

19

slippery slope here.

20

tell you is this is a normal way of valuation.

21

you allow this, then any valuation is going to be

22

creditable.

23

flat wrong is because almost every effort in valuation

24

is prospective.

25

And let me tell you why there is no
First, the big thing they want to
And, if

That is flat wrong, and the reason that's

If you want to try to value a piece of
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

property, you could value it by saying, well, what kind

2

of rents can I get on this property, and I'll discount

3

them back to net present value.

4

conceive of a property tax as a tax on a percentage of

5

those projected future earnings.

6

But you know what?

And I suppose you can

Easily obviously not

7

creditable because the first requirement on the

8

regulation is that there be a realization event.

9

when you're talking about projected future income

10

streams, there's no realization events.

11

are off the table.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

So all of those

So why isn't that to say

13

I want to find the original floatation value, and,

14

instead of estimating what the profits are, I'm simply

15

going to use the ones that happen?

16

MR. CLEMENT:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

Exactly -So why is that

different?

19

MR. CLEMENT:

Because you never would do

20

that in any normal valuation.

21

occasionally, in valuation, you have to go back in time.

22

This isn't the only place in the world that anybody

23

said, I wonder what Google's stock was worth, like, back

24

in the day.

25

What you would do --

But, when you do that for valuation
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

purposes, the first rule of thumb is to avoid hindsight

2

bias, and so this tax uniquely taxes nothing, but

3

hindsight bias.

4

It's going back to 1990 --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there -- there is

5

an argument about that because it has two components

6

that you keep ignoring, the floatation value and the

7

time that the company --

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9

those other variables.

I would love to talk about
The floatation value -- I mean,

10

it's a tax between the difference between -- between two

11

variables.

12

The reason I am focusing on the value and

13

profit-making terms is because it's the larger of the

14

two numbers, and the tax falls in the difference between

15

the two, and the floatation value is basically taken as

16

a given.

And --

17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:
please.

19
20

Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry,

MR. CLEMENT:

Go ahead.

I mean, I could

talk floatation value all day.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I'd really like to

22

hear -- I'd really like to hear what you are going to

23

say.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

my question.
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Then let me ask you

Official

1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

No, Justice Kagan.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Wait, Justice Kagan.

Ok. Do you agree -- I mean, you

4

said we should look to the way this is designed, so

5

let's look to the way that the actual formula is

6

designed.
Do you agree that this tax would impose

7
8

identical tax liability for companies with -- at the

9

same average profits, but could impose very different

10

tax liability for companies with the same total profits?
That's the way the thing is designed, is it

11
12

not?
MR. CLEMENT:

13

Yes, and that's true of every

14

Excess Profits Tax, Your Honor.

15

tax -JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

What matters for those

Well, that's the question.

17

Is that true of every Excess Profits Tax?

18

hypothetical like this:

19

A and Company B, and one company operates over four

20

years and makes a lot of money, and one company operates

21

over one year and makes only a quarter of that amount of

22

money.

23

Take a -- a

You have two companies, Company

Now, a typical Excess Profits Tax is going

24

to take Company A, which has made a lot of money, and --

25

and it's going to end up paying four times as much tax

13
Alderson Reporting Company

as Company B, which has made only a quarter of the

2

amount of money.

3

Company B pay the exact same thing; isn't that right?

4

MR. CLEMENT:
different taxes.

6
7

No.

They -- they would pay

I mean, they pay the same rate --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One year or four years?

Four --

8
9

But, under this tax, Company A and

MR. CLEMENT:
have the same rate.

They have the same -- they'd

They'd have -- I mean,

10

the same calculation, but it would affect them very

11

differently.

12

But in -JUSTICE KAGAN:

In other words, a company

13

that has made four times as much profits under this

14

formula could pay the same tax; isn't that right?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

I -- I don't think --

four times as long.

18

MR. CLEMENT:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20
21

Because it was operating

Right.
And because there is that D

variable.
MR. CLEMENT:

Right -- that's right.

22

of course, the floatation value is going to play a

23

bigger role in the other company --

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But,

Assuming the floatation

value is the same for both companies.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

MR. CLEMENT:

Then -- then maybe it could,

Justice Kagan, but let me say two things about that --

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It definitely could.

It

4

would have to.

5

to tax is not total profits.

6

average profits, or what may be the better way to say

7

it, is it's taxing profitability and not profits.

8
9

And that's because what this is trying

MR. CLEMENT:

This is trying to tax

No.

With all due respect,

it's taxing profits above a threshold, and the threshold

10

is determined by floatation value.

11

that the tax applies -- and that is the way you look at

12

the creditability of these taxes, you ignore the

13

outlier.

14

4/9ths of the floatation value.

15

For most companies

For most of those companies, it's going to be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but the reason why

16

this formula was devised in the way that this formula

17

was devised was specifically to get at the outlier.

18

other words, it was to get at the company that only

19

operated for a short amount of time, but they wanted

20

that company to pay just as big a tax bill as the

21

company that had operated for a much longer amount of

22

time and had made many more profits.

23

In

So the end result is that this company that

24

operates for a very short amount of time and makes

25

almost no excess profits pays the exact same tax bill as
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a company with four times as much excess profits.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's not right, Your

3

Honor.

4

trying to do -- first of all, the outliers, the reason

5

they included them in is they figured they had to

6

because it fit within their definition of the regulated

7

companies they were trying to catch.

8
9

I -- it really is not.

And what they were

Now, they knew they had -- and this is only
two companies we are talking about -- they knew they had

10

a shorter period, so they knew this would fall

11

differently on them as a substantive matter no matter --

12

no matter how they did it.

13

The reason they didn't care much is because

14

those companies got something that the other companies

15

didn't, which is they got to operate for the next three

16

years in a favorable regulatory environment in which no

17

Excess Profits Tax would be imposed on them.

18

look like they have a higher rate -- effective rate

19

under our calculation.

20

So it may

They do have a higher effective rate over

21

a -- over a relatively small amount over the threshold,

22

but they make that up, essentially, in the out-years

23

because they make money under the favorable regulatory

24

regime.

25

And, again, the theory of this is, for four
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

years after floatation, there is a favorable regulatory

2

regime in which they make excess profits.

3

companies get to make money in the out-years, two,

4

three, four, without any excess profits because it was

5

really important for them to make this a one-off tax.

6
7

But if I can get back to your question
because there is this phenomenon --

8
9
10

Those two

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

Why -- why

didn't -- why weren't they subject to a favorable
regulatory regime in two, three, and four?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

They were.

They weren't --

12

but they weren't subject to any tax for it because,

13

remember, they -- this is very important for Labour.

14

They are coming in after 20 years of conservative rule.

15

They don't want to be the old Labour party.

16

want to put in a new permanent tax, so they want to do

17

this once.

18

They don't

And so that works great for my clients

19

because they -- they were privatized in 1990.

But, when

20

they're doing this in 1997, they get a couple of

21

outlying companies that were only privatized in '96.

22

what they do is they hit them with a reasonably tough

23

tax in year one, but year two, three, and four, they

24

were in a favorable regulatory environment, and they get

25

no tax at all.

So -- you know, don't -- don't cry any
17
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

tears for them.

2

Now, the point I thought you were going

3

to ask me, though, is, even with the companies with the

4

same denominator, it is true that companies with the

5

same profits can be subjected to different taxes, but

6

that's because it's an Excess Profits Tax.

7

what is true of --

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that is

No, but even companies with

the exact same profits and the exact same floatation

10

value can be subject to different taxes, and that's a

11

result of the amount of time, that's a result of the D

12

variable.

13
14
15

If you were right -MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, that's only true

of -JUSTICE KAGAN:

Excuse me.

If you were

16

right, the D variable wouldn't exist.

17

Excess Profits Tax, it would have been written without a

18

D variable because they would not have cared whether it

19

was four years or one year or any place in-between.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

If this were an

With respect, I disagree

21

because, first of all, it's only those two companies,

22

from what you said, is -- it could possibly be true.

23

to the rest of the companies, the reason that they were

24

trying to use D is because they were trying to capture

25

the excess profits during a period in which there is a
18
Alderson Reporting Company

As

Official

1

particular regulatory environment with -- where they --

2

where they thought they earned excess profits.

3

For all of the companies they reached, that

4

period was the D with the exception of the outliers, and

5

the reason they had a different outlier is because they

6

were recently privatized.

7

substance of this tax, it is taxing -- their term --

8

value and profit-making terms, but not any abstract

9

profit-making terms, profits over a reported period.

10

But, if you think about the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If you were right, it would

11

just be a 52 percent tax on annual profits above 1/9th

12

of floatation value, and it's not that.

that -- specifically, in order to get at railroad track,

14

which would have paid very little tax under your

15

formula, but, instead, pays a great amount of tax

16

because they think that railroad track got the same good

17

deal at the beginning as all these other companies did,

18

but -- so, even though they didn't make very much

19

in the way of excess profits, they were going to tax

20

them just as much.

MR. CLEMENT:

It's not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem with their

2

argument, Mr. Clement, is that you are undermining your

3

own argument.

4

lesser tax, it's because their floatation value was made

5

more equal by this formula.

If they are getting three full years at a

6

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's not right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So they don't need to be

8

taxed any more, moving forward, because they got it

9

right.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's -- with all due

11

respect, that's not right.

The floatation value is

12

calculated the same way for each of these companies, and

13

the theory of why the floatation value is too low is the

14

same for all of them, which is, under the regulatory

15

policies, they are going to hold the prices firm for a

16

four-year period, and they are going to increase

17

efficiencies and reduce costs, and they are going to

18

make money.

19

That is supposed to incentivize them, and

20

then that's the basis for all the regulatory policies

21

going forward.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I wanted -- I just wanted

23

to hear what you were going to say in answer to the

24

second part of Justice Sotomayor's earlier question.

25

And, to remind you of that, you were going to explain to
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

us, which I felt I needed, the second term -- that

2

second term.

And that just says, "FV," for value.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

But I did notice, that if

5

you make .23 times fair value, not quite by coincidence,

6

happens to be what the companies would have made over

7

a period of 2 years in profit, had it been the truth

8

that the value of such companies was, as valued by the

9

market, 9 times their earnings because a company that's

10

valued 9 times its earnings earns about 11 point

11

something percent per year -- taking aside all other

12

factors -- and 2 years' worth is that.

13

And I don't know if I've got that part

14

right, but, if I do have that part right, then what this

15

tax does is it takes the profits the firms actually --

16

actually made over 2 years -- not quite actually.

17

assumes twice the -- the value of the first year.

18

It

You see, so whatever they made the first

19

year -- and, if it's only 6 months, it's twice 6

20

months -- you know -- that first part figures out what

21

they really made over the first year and then multiplies

22

it by two.

23

that the amount that they would have made over 2 years.

And you take that, and you subtract from

24

Now -- so it looked, to me, pretty -- this

25

helps you, of course, but -- but it also is calculated
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

on an average, the average of the first year's profit,

2

they consider that the average; and, therefore, they are

3

right in saying -- you know, a firm that was only in

4

business for 6 months will be taxed -- the whole 2-year

5

extra will be taken away, even when there was no 2-year

6

extra, you see?

7

their gross income.

8
9

So that firm would have paid more than

Of course, there is no such firm, and that's
their problem, but we come to that later.

But I want

10

your view, if you can -- if I've explained it clearly

11

enough, so you get where I'm coming from, and -- and --

12

if -- if I have explained that clearly enough, I'd really

13

appreciate what you think about it.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I think so, but I

15

think I get there in a slightly different way because I

16

guess I don't see the natural relationship between the

17

23 percent and the floatation value, but I think I get

18

to a similar place, which is, if you think about it the

19

way that we formulate it, it's 51.75 percent of 4/9ths

20

of floatation value.

21

Now, the -- the floatation value is

22

calculated based on the initial share price, plus the

23

number of shares.

24

the electrical utilities was 2 pounds, 40 pence.

25

it's just 2 pounds, 40 pence, by however many shares

And the initial share price for all

22
Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

1

there were.

2

Okay.

So that's floatation value.

The -- the floor for the excess profits is

3

4/9ths of floatation value.

4

on an annualized average basis and if you want to -- you

5

know, this is at 64a of the petition appendix when the

6

Tax Court did it -- but what that means in practice is

7

this tax is taxing 51.75 percent of the profits above

8

1/9th of the floatation --

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, if you want to get it

It will do that for firms

that are in business for 4 years.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

12

Absolutely.

It won't do

13

that for a firm that was in business 6 months.

different number.

There is only one company like that;

MR. CLEMENT:

It's stipulated --

6

particularly on the other side, want to make quite a lot

7

out of that fact.

8

of the fact that for that single -- whatever it's called

MR. CLEMENT:

Railtrack.

But, again,

Railtrack did not pay more in taxes than they made in --

And they want to make quite a lot out

JUSTICE BREYER:
didn't.

I know -- I know they

It didn't happen in this instance.
MR. CLEMENT:

And -- and -- and that is a

15

very important fact because when you are trying to

16

figure out --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Okay.

18

MR. CLEMENT: -- what -- and, again, their

19

regulation says, you look to the application of the

20

statute, in the normal circumstances in which it

21

applies.

22

In the normal circumstances in which this

23

applies -- and, this, the parties stipulated to -- every

24

company paid less in this Excess Profits Tax or windfall

25

tax than they made in initial period profits.

Alderson Reporting Company

is all that really matters.

for a lot of these companies, the base amount was larger

than the -- than their initial period profits.

cares?

6

This --

7

Who

I mean, that's just an artificial number.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's go back to my

8

initial question.

9

your actual profits in any way, it's a credit that they

10

13

If someone uses

are entitled to?

11
12

What's the rule?

MR. CLEMENT:

No.

I don't think so because,

again -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I don't know how

14

you get around it because you seem to be saying to us

15

that, no matter how -- what formula you create, so long

16

as we can simplify it in math to affect which -- take

17

any variables in it and fix them in any way, that's a

18

creditable tax.

19

That seems to be what your argument is.

MR. CLEMENT:

No, it's not,

20

Justice Sotomayor.

21

question, I think, got to; one, I thought I already

22

dealt with, which is future valuation is not a problem.

23

There is no realization of it.

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Now, there's two things your

No, I'm saying to you

that any tax that relies upon actual profits, in any
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

way, you say is wrong.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

And it's not right or wrong.

3

We would say it's creditable, if that's its predominant

4

character.

5

ten-factor test, where past realized profits is one of

6

the ten factors, but you also look at real market

7

valuation and some other factor, then I'm probably going

8

to lose.

9

So if you want to put that as part of a

But, in this instance, the only moving

10

factor -- the only thing that changes from

11

company-to-company, other than the floatation value,

12

which is fixed, is their profits.

13

know, nobody doubts --

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
is not fixed.

And nobody -- you

No, the floatation value

It was different for each company.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -They only fixed the

18

percentage that they're going to use, but the actual

19

amount paid was different for every company.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

But, again, that is classic

21

Excess Profits Tax.

So let me try to come at it this

22

way, which is to say, suppose you had a country that had

23

a tax that said, we are going to tax your value, and we

24

are going to measure your -- your -- your value based on

25

the income you made in the last year or the last 2
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

years.

2

Now, I would say that that is clearly a

3

creditable income tax.

4

are going to tax your value, and we are going to

5

calculate your value based on your income over the last

6

2 years, but we are going to subtract 10 percent of your

7

market cap, that would be an Excess Profits Tax.

8
9

If they said the same thing, we

The market cap would be different for every
company, so there would be another thing that was

10

different for each company, and the effective rate might

11

be different, but that's okay because that's how an

12

excessive profits tax works.

13

The last thing I'd say before I go sit down

14

is that's how the 1917 United States Excess Profits Tax

15

worked.

16

profits taxes are creditable, surely, that's what they

17

had in mind, and this is very similar to that classic,

18

prototypical Excess Profits Tax.

In 1918, when Congress said that foreign excess

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

The windfall tax is not an income tax.

1

It

2

tax -- is a tax on an increment of company value.

3

company's profits multiplied by a price to earnings

4

ratio is a typical way of imputing a value on a company.

5

Using profits as one variable in that valuation formula

6

does not transform a tax on company value into an income

7

tax.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

A

That -- that's a way of

I -- I don't know that anybody

10

values a company that -- that is sold on the market by

11

saying how much money did they make in the last 2 years,

12

and we are going to multiply that by 9.

13

what people were paying you in the market.
MS. O'CONNELL:

15

what Parliament was trying to do here was to impute a

value on the company for which it should have been sold in

that value should have been.

2

MS. O'CONNELL:

3

Parliament was trying to come up with a value that it

4

should have charged for these companies in 1990 and --

5

you know --

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, since there is no real

7

value, I -- I mean, maybe there is because they did it

8

in the form of an IPO, and the share then went the next

9

day into the market, and, when it went the next day into

10

the market, did the market pay a lot more?

on the next day, that wouldn't capture all of the

21

efficiencies that were realized over the --

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, yes.

But, of course,

23

in the -- in the past, we are making a prediction

24

about what efficiencies will be realized, and, in the

25

future, we know.

So the one thing we don't know, since

Alderson Reporting Company

life is risky -- or we do know for sure -- is whatever

2

it shows up to be in the future couldn't have been the

3

value that shareholders would put on it in the past

4

because they know life a risky.

5

MS. O'CONNELL:

6

that is one thing that is -- is the --

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that is true.

And

So the reason that that is

8

relevant here, of course, is this number 9 is a made-up

9

number.

It may be made up by great experts, but since

10

they are all not geniuses who are -- own the whole

11

world, they must not be perfect experts.

MS. O'CONNELL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

arbitrary number.

It is -- it is -Isn't that true?
The number 9 was not an

It was --

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it was a number picked

17

by whatever company had -- what is it, the -- the lowest

18

price earnings ratio or something like that.

MS. O'CONNELL:

price ratio.
JUSTICE BREYER:

22

that means whatever company that the shareholders

23

thought would deviate the least from whatever the return

24

was and that doesn't apply the others.

want a lecture from me on this subject.
30
Alderson Reporting Company

But you don't

Official

1

What I want is an answer from you, and the

2

answer I want from you is this:

3

understand that this number is a semi made-up number, I

4

did look at that second term, and I thought that .23

5

times 9 is about 2 years' worth -- about 2 years' worth

6

of profits that would be expected, all things left out

7

of it, except profit.

8
9

As I read it and once

And so then, once I saw that, I looked at
the first term.

And the first term seemed, to me, to be

10

their actual profit -- their actual profit on an annual

11

basis multiplied by about the same number, you see?

12

And so what we do is we take -- about

13

multiplying, you see -- so we take about two years'

14

worth of profit that they actually made, and we subtract

15

from that two years' worth that our experts tell us they

16

should have made as -- on the basis of the original

17

market price.

18

all of it, for two years only.

19

The rest is excess profit, and we seize

And, by the way, if a company had only six

20

months' worth, well, then -- you know, they might really

21

be hurt because, after all, they only earned six months

22

at the annual rate that showed something, and maybe they

23

didn't really earn it over the next 18 months.

24

reply was there was no such company.

because time periods vary, rates will vary.

But you -- you

Justice Breyer, I think the

15

problem with -- when we start to reformulate what this

16

tax is or is not taxing or what the amount of the actual

17

tax is, just shows the danger of trying to reformulate

18

what parliament actually did in trying to determine if

19

it's an income tax.

20

As the professor's amicus brief points out,

21

if you reformulated this into an average annual profit

22

or left the P over 4 as it was and then divided

23

everything else by 9, this would become a 207 percent

Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

mean, isn't an income tax dependant upon whether it's a

3

tax on income, not the rate?

4

companies pay a high rate and others pay a low rate,

5

even if that's totally arbitrary, wouldn't make a

6

definition to the characterization.

And -- and whether some

In that characterization -As long as you're not --

they actually have the gross income from which this
comes.

11

MS. O'CONNELL:

In that characterization,

12

Justice Breyer, the 207 percent of average annual

13

profits over 1/9th of floatation value, then, no, it's

14

not an income tax and the rate does matter because it's

15

completely confiscatory of that profits base.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, it will.

Wait, wait,

17

It is greater than the profit they earned

essential features of the U.S. income tax.

I think

2

if there was a country that imposed an income tax every

six years and said, every sixth year, you'll pay an

income tax over the last six years, then that would

probably still be an income tax.

anything close to what they're doing or what Parliament

multiplies it by a price-to-earnings ratio to impute a

value on the company.

13

Parliament has taken a valuation formula,

14

received for the company, which we think shows that the

substance of this tax is that it's a tax on an increment

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, the point is that --

19

the fact that there is a D variable there shows that

earnings figure on each company to create a value for

it.

Justice is, of course, right, the amicus brief is the

argument, which I think is the right argument.

14

you're not saying that's wrong?

15

The Chief

It's not wrong.

But

We think

16

that both the -- the D variable and the flotation value

17

variable add extra support for the idea that this is a

18

tax on an increment of company value.

19

it's trying to impute an annual earnings figure on each

20

company.

21

The D shows that

The floatation value shows that it's not

concerned just with how profitable any particular

company is, but with how profitable it is in relation to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought you were

2

saying that that argument was wrong because you looked

3

to the predominant character of the tax and that it's

4

either a tax -- it's either an income tax or it's not.

5

It wouldn't be an income tax on the vast

6

majority of the companies where it was the same and not

7

on the companies where it was a large value or the other

8

way around.

9

and you decide whether it's a tax or not on that basis.

10

You look at the predominant characteristic

MS. O'CONNELL:

That's right.

But I'm not

11

saying that the -- that the argument the amicus are

12

making is wrong.

13

We're -- we're just saying --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because they're saying this

14

is not an income for anybody because, in fact, this

15

doesn't tax anybody's income.

16

me -- it taxes average profits, not total profits.

17

taxes profitability as a mechanism to tax value.

MS. O'CONNELL:

It taxes annual -- excuse
It

That particular aspect of

19

the amicus brief that says, if it's bad for one, it's

20

bad for all, yes, that is not our position.

21

is not our position, that you look at the tax based on

22

the normal circumstances in which it applies.

23

If it -- it

So I think we are in general agreement with

24

PPL that, if there are outliers, where net gain would be

25

totally confiscated, you'd look at it in the -- in the

Official

1

normal circumstances in which it applies.

2

the regulation says.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's what

Well, now, I'm totally

4

confused because this outlier is an outlier not because

5

the tax hasn't worked.

6

the tax is designed to get at, that this formula was

7

developed with this D variable, in order to make sure

8

that outliers, meaning people -- companies that operated

9

for only a short amount of time would still pay a

10

It's an -- it's an outlier that

significant tax bill.

11

So the whole design of this tax was to get

12

at the outlier.

13

predominant character of the tax is not an income tax,

14

but is, instead, a value tax.

15

That seems, to me, to suggest that the

MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, I mean, you could also

16

get to that by saying that the predominant character of

17

this tax is -- is not an income tax because of the way

18

that it applies to everybody else.

19

principal argument.

20

I think that's our

If there were some outlying companies for

21

which this didn't look like an income tax, I think the

22

regulation allows some flexibility there where it says,

23

we look at it in the normal circumstances in which it

24

applies.

25

an income tax for everybody.

And, if that makes it an income tax, then it's

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I think an important point here is that the

2

Petitioners have conceded that if Parliament had chosen

3

a different valuation method, like the stock price, for

4

any particular company and then subtracted out the

5

floatation value, that that would not be a tax on

6

income, that that would be a value tax.

7

The fact that Parliament chose a different

8

way to place a value on each company shouldn't become a

9

tax on income just because profits is one variable in

10

that tax equation.

11

taxes that just use this typical earnings times the

12

price-to-earnings ratio for an income tax credit -- a

13

dollar-for-dollar credit in the United States, just

14

because the tax was written that way.

15

That would open up many foreign

We think what Parliament was doing here was

clearly trying to impute a value on each company and

In

19

If the Court thinks that both of the

20

formulas are equivalent, the tax that Parliament

21

actually wrote and the rewritten tax of 51.75 percent of

22

your four years of profits over 4/9ths of the floatation

23

value, then there is a couple of reasons that you should

24

go with the tax that Parliament actually wrote.

25

The first is that exemptions from taxation
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

are construed narrowly, and a business -- a foreign

2

income tax that is paid to a foreign -- or I'm sorry --

3

a foreign tax that is paid to a foreign government that

4

is not an income tax is usually just treated as a

5

deduction.

6

And the IRS has said, throughout this case,

7

that it is perfectly happy to treat this windfall tax as

8

a deduction; it just would not get a dollar-for-dollar

9

credit --

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

On that -- on the question

11

of how to treat, I -- there isn't authority, but, I

12

mean, if I'm quite honest about how I think about it, I

13

think the people in the tax court actually, usually,

14

know more about it than the judges who are not on the

15

tax court.

16

And so when I get an opinion and the tax

17

court all thinks one thing and then the court of appeals

18

is thinking something else and it's highly technical,

19

I -- I tend to be tempted to say, well, the tax courts

20

deserve something.

21
22
23

Now, is there anything, really?

Am I just

doing that wrong, if I did that?
MS. O'CONNELL:

Well, Justice Breyer, with

24

due respect to the tax court, the tax court didn't even

25

analyze any of the three regulatory tests that are set

Do we owe

I think, to the extent

8

that there is any ambiguity about what the regulation

means, then the Commissioner's interpretation of his own

10

That's true.

Well --

It doesn't seem to

move the ball much, one way or the other.
MS. O'CONNELL:

That's true, unless you

19

accept Petitioner's argument, that what the regulation

20

means when it says you evaluate the tax based on its

21

predominant character is that that means you can rewrite

22

the tax before you start testing it against the three

23

regulatory requirements, and, in which case, this would

24

be a 51.75 percent tax on four years of profits that you

25

are testing against the three regulatory requirements.

completely rewrite the statutory tax base before you

test it against those three regulatory requirements.

ahead.

call valuation tax every year, and it was based the same

way, it's based on profits that year, saying, we're

going to say, we think the value of this company is now

this much because they made -- whatever -- $20 million

last year.

2

taxing that value.

are -- if you just -- if you are applying just to a

company -- say that the United States was imposing a

property tax on corporations and it decided to calculate

be reformulated to look like a tax on the company's --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, if you

If the reformulation --

22

think of -- think that first term.

Put it in your mind.

23

Now, that first term does have a number -- .23 -- and

24

let's do times 9, which is that valuation business.

25

what you get is a little over 2.

Okay?

1

And you are going to get that every time.

2

That's not going to vary from company-to-company.

That

3

varies as long as the universe is here.

4

we're going to multiply .2 -- rather, 2 point something

5

times that first part of the first term.

So we know

6

And that first part of the first term

7

consists of nothing other than, for the four-year

8

company, the average one-year profit.

9

what you are telling people to do in that first term is

So the only --

10

simply multiply by a little over than 2 -- a little more

11

than 2 -- the average profit earned over a four-year

12

period.

That's what it says.

13

So there is nothing there but income.

It's

14

average income, I grant you.

15

but income.

what you subtract from that is a quarter -- is a quarter

of the value, I grant you.

average profit over the four-year period.

times 365 because they want to annualize it.

So, if you have a four years, what you are

9

briefs.
But, if all you were to do were to compare

12

the final tax bill to the company's net profits over the

for the IRS to -- to make the regulation even more clear

than it already is, if this Court were to conclude that

Well, Justice Breyer,

20

they're -- they're not.

SWEB, the subsidiary of

21

Petitioner, paid the British income tax in the same

22

years that it paid this windfall tax, in 1997 and 1998.

23

And Petitioner got a dollar-for-dollar foreign tax

24

credit for its portion of that British income tax that

25

was paid in those years.
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

For any other tax that's imposed by a

2

foreign government that's not the income tax or that's

3

not an Excess Profits Tax or a war profits tax, the

4

company can get a tax deduction.

5

or other taxes are normally treated.

6

That's how profits --

You deduct from the amount of income that

7

you are reporting to the IRS, the dollars that you paid

8

toward that foreign tax, and the -- the value of that

9

deduction depends on the marginal tax rate that the

10

taxpayer is paying.

11

So you might get 35 cents on the dollar for

12

every dollar that you can subtract from your income tax

13

base.

14

is reserved for foreign taxes that have the equivalent

15

features of the U.S. income tax, and the windfall tax

16

simply doesn't.

17

But the dollar-for-dollar credit in Section 901

It's written as a valuation formula, and

18

it's not just written that way, but that's the substance

19

of what it's trying to do.

20

each company for what the U.K. government should have

21

charged, and it's subtracting out the amount of money

22

that it actually received.

23

It's imputing a value on

And I think that's an important point to

24

keep in mind when determining what is the -- the

25

substance of this tax, is that the U.K. government is not
52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

just going out into the world and taxing companies that

2

it thinks are particularly profitable, to try to get

3

more money.

4

The U.K. government used to own these

5

companies, and it sold them at too low a price, and the

6

windfall tax is an effort to get back some of that value

7

that it should have asked for when it sold them.

8
9
10

Whether that's a good idea or a bad idea,
it's not an income tax, in the U.S. sense, and it should
not be entitled to a credit under Section 901.

could have done that because, on day one, there was

1

about a 20 percent pop -- that's -- to use the IPO

2

word -- there's about a 20 percent pop in value at the

3

end of the first day's trading.

4

that.

5

They could have taxed

If they wanted to be a little less precise,

6

but capture a little more value, they could have gone

7

30 days out or 60 days out, on the theory that it took a

8

while for the information to make it in to the market.

9

That would have been a value tax.

10

I wouldn't be up here

arguing that it's creditable.

11

But what they did was something very

12

different.

13

of value, not value unmodified, but value in

14

profit-making terms.

15

some abstract sense that takes into account future

16

income streams, but profit-making terms, as measured by

17

4 years of reported profits that satisfy every test of

18

the regulation.

19

They used a sui generis, very unique concept

And not profit-making terms in

They're realized profits, they're based on

20

gross receipts, and they reflect exactly to the penny --

21

to the pence, the net income.

22

this tax on.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's what they base

Mr. Clement, what do you

24

think would -- is the answer -- suppose that the Labour

25

government had come in -- not after 4 years but after 2
54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

years -- that they had looked at those 2 years of profits,

2

they said, that's enough for us, to know that these

3

companies were grossly undervalued, and they had done

4

this exact same formula, and the result is that they

5

would have ended up with a tax rate of over 100 percent.

6

Would that have been creditable or not?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

I would be here with a more

8

difficult case, Justice Kagan.

I would love to argue

9

that that is still creditable because I think you could

10

live in a country that has an income tax, especially an

11

Excess Profits Tax on a few disfavored industries, that

12

has a rate over 100 percent.
But I would run into a regulatory hurdle,

13
14

and, if I had had that case, I would have had to

15

challenge the regulations.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I would have loved to do it.
I guess what the

17

hypothetical suggests is that, in some respects, the

18

fact that you now -- that you have a tax rate here of

19

between 0 and 1 is a bit of a fluke -- you know, if they

20

had come in a little bit earlier and done the exact same

21

thing, based on their understanding of how profitable

22

these companies were, which they would have seen after 2

23

years, you wouldn't have been able to make the same

24

argument.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

Can I just say, though, it

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

wouldn't have been a fluke because one of the things

2

that the people that constructed this tax wanted out of

3

this tax is they wanted it paid.

4

So it's not a fluke that they didn't impose

5

a huge tax in excess of initial period profits on any

6

company because they wanted to make sure the incidents

7

of this tax was on companies that could actually pay it.

8

And, if you do that based on 4 years' of reported

9

profits, you're pretty sure that people are going to be

10

able to pay it.

11

I would like to bring back to the -- the

12

concession, I think, that ultimately was made by the

13

government, that, if a foreign government has a tax on

14

value, that the only measure of value is the past years'

15

reported income, that that would be a creditable income

16

tax.

17

by 9.

18

Well, I don't think it changes if you multiply it
I don't think it changes if you divide it by 4.
I don't think if there is one company, that

19

you divide it by 1/4, instead of 4 -- any of that

20

changes the analysis, nor does it change the analysis if

21

you subtract out some figure that represents a market

22

cap or initial floatation value.

23

That would make it an Excess Profits Tax,

24

rather than a simple income tax, and that is what the

25

British government did.
56
Alderson Reporting Company

I'll just close by bringing you back

1
2

75 years to the Biddle case.

3

was an argument about a British tax and whether we

4

should follow the form of the tax or the substance of

5

this tax.

6

In the Biddle case, there

This Court said that we, of course, in

7

looking at a foreign tax, don't bind ourselves by

8

foreign classifications or characterizations.

9

to the substance of the tax.

10

We look

In the Biddle case, the rule that you look

11

to substance, not form, benefited the Commissioner.

12

There's no reason for a different rule when the shoe is

13

on the other foot.

14

Thank you.
