CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Case 11-1221, Hillman v. Maretta.

Mr. Ruttenberg?

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. RUTTENBERG

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

Congress intentionally designed FEGLIA so

11

that the Federal interest ends once the insurance

12

proceeds are paid out.

13

Federal employees to carry out their responsibilities to

14

their families.

FEGLIA was established to enable

15

And Congress knew that some of its employees

16

would get divorced, and it was depending upon State laws

17

to help make sure that these family duties and

18

obligations were carried out because Congress doesn't

19

want to get into the -- the business of regulating the

20

divorce.

21
22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why did it make an

exception then only for divorce decrees?

23

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Justice --

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, there is an express

25

exception in the statute that the beneficiary can be
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

changed by a decree of divorce.

2

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Now, why would Congress say

4

that while at the same time believing that the

5

beneficiary can effectively be changed without a decree

6

of divorce?

7

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Justice Scalia, because

8

Congress knew that one of the main purposes behind

9

FEGLIA was to help the insureds or enable the insureds

10
11
12
13

to carry out responsibilities to their families.
And that is a mechanism to help do that, but
it wasn't -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's written -- but

14

it's written in such precise terms, it must be

15

incorporated in a divorce decree, and the decree must be

16

filed with the employee agency pre-death.

17

saying is this specific exception, rightly cabined, is

18

generalized so that in all cases, the second wife will

19

prevail over the first.

20

MR. RUTTENBERG:

What you're

Justice Ginsburg, I believe

21

that the requirements that it get filed in -- it being a

22

divorce decree and it get filed before death, are an

23

example of Congress intending to preempt the field of

24

interference with the FEGLI plan.

25

It -- Congress did this in several
4
Alderson Reporting Company

occasions.

2

designation, you have to do it before -- in order for it

3

to be honored, it's got to be filed before death.

4

same thing with an assignment.

5

assignment has to be done before death.

If you wanted to do a beneficiary

The

An irrevocable

6

These are all examples of Congress saying we

7

don't want States interfering with the administration of

8

FEGLIA plans, but I don't think it is a statement that

9

Congress is saying we don't want States to regulate

10

domestic relations when it comes to FEGLI benefits.

11

The -- the intent of Congress with regard to

12

FEGLI benefits needs to be gained from a review of the

13

entire statute of FEGLIA.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why should it be

15

different than the outcome in Wissner and Ridgway and

16

one -- one case that you cite quite often is the

17

Hisquierdo case for -- you -- you cite it for deference

18

to State domestic relations law, but what was the

19

outcome in that case?

20

MR. RUTTENBERG:

The outcome in that case

21

was the preemption prevailed in that case.

22

citing the -- the case of Hisquierdo because I think it

23

very well lays out the presumption against preemption of

24

family law.

25

overcome, as it was in Ridgway, and as it was in

I -- I was

And -- and while that presumption can be

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Hisquierdo, it -- it still is there.

2

And it's -- it's a statement that Congress

3

generally is not looking to regulate divorce.

4

Congress can't do it when it wants to, but that this

5

Court normally starts its analysis assuming that

6

Congress didn't intend to do that, unless they find

7

direct -- a direct enactment saying this is -- we want

8

to preempt all other State laws.

9
10

Not that

That -- that was the -- the purpose behind
citing Hisquierdo.

11

But to answer your first question --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But, you know, the -- the

12

exception suggests another thing besides the fact that

13

it suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails

14

is by a divorce decree.

15

Congress's sole purpose -- that Congress did not have

16

the sole purpose in this statute to make it easy for the

17

insurance company that has to pay out the proceeds to

18

know whom the -- who the beneficiary will be.

19

It also suggests that

If that were the case, there wouldn't be

20

this exception for a divorce decree because the

21

insurance company is going to have to look to see if

22

there's a divorce decree on the books, blah, blah, blah,

23

blah, blah.

24

statute not only had a concern about efficiency of

25

payment, but also had a concern about who gets the

That obviously shows that Congress in this

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

payment, right?

2
3

There's no other way to explain the -- the
exception for divorce decrees.

4

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Well, the exception for

5

divorce decrees I would analogize to the Rose case, when

6

this case was -- when this Court was addressing

7

veterans' benefits.

8

distinguished Ridgway and Wissner because the purpose

9

behind the Veterans' Benefits Statute this Court

And in the Rose case, this Court

10

determined was in part to take care of the veterans'

11

families and it looked at -- it looked at the text.

12

It looked at the Senate report that said

13

that, but it also looked at the text.

14

in Rose a -- a provision which said the Veterans

15

Administration can apportion a part of those benefits

16

for the benefit of the noncustodial children.

17

was argued in that case that that's Congress's statement

18

that this is the only exception and further exceptions

19

shouldn't be applied and Congress was trying to regulate

20

this area.

21

And the text had

And it

But this Court said that's not what Congress

22

was doing there.

23

cared about -- that those benefits were there to help

24

take care of the family members.

That was Congress showing that they

In Rose, there was

were his only assets.

designated.

14

This is taking it from the designated

MR. RUTTENBERG:

That's correct, Your Honor.

15

But I -- I think when you look at the purpose, the

16

stated purpose of FEGLIA, which is to help insureds

17

carry out their responsibilities to their families --

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And you think that's the --

19

that's the purpose of this exception for divorce

20

decrees?

21

MR. RUTTENBERG:

I think that --

JUSTICE SCALIA:

In your experience, a man

24

25

either.

3

money for the kids, it would have left the money with

4

the first wife.

I -- I think if Congress was concerned about

5

MR. RUTTENBERG:

I think what Congress was

6

doing is Congress was making a statement -- I don't

7

think they were trying to say they were looking at this

8

divorce law in particular.

9

saying is that, we're just going to look to the States

I think what Congress was

10

and let the States use their benefit and wisdom to

11

determine which divorce laws should apply and which

12

shouldn't apply.

13

So that in this case in particular, there --

14

there are benefits and detriments possibly to section D,

15

but what this Court I think would be appropriate to do

16

would to -- to pass a bright-line rule that said State

17

laws that interfere with the administration of a plan

18

are preempted, but after that, after the money has been

19

paid out, laws that affect the benefits are not

20

preempted, and that -- that allows the States to

21

be --

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words, they're

23

preempted, but the whole purpose of the preemption can

24

be thwarted.

25

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Justice Kennedy, it's not

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the purpose of the preemption.

2

to this Court's opinion in Egelhoff.

3

it looks like, especially with the language, that that's

4

what the States are trying to do, trying to end run

5

preemption.

6

Section D was a response
And at first blush

But that -- when you look at it closely,

7

that's not what was going on.

8

Court found that Congress intended to preempt a

9

Washington statute very similar to section A, but what

In -- in Egelhoff, this

10

Congress was preempting was a State interfering with the

11

administration of the plan.

12

State domestic relations equitable remedy designed to

13

protect the people to whom the Federal employee owed a

14

duty of support.

15

It wasn't preempting a

It wasn't that -- that the States were not

16

listening to Congress or this Court, and they're not

17

sticking their fingers in their ears going la, la, la, I

18

can't hear you.

19

State had a estimated tax payment law that said when you

20

get insurance, you've got to pay 10 percent into the

21

court or into the State, that wouldn't be preempted.

22

But if the State thereafter had a law, enacted a law

23

that said we want a withholding requirement and if that

24

money is withheld then you don't have to do the

25

estimated tax payment, well, that would clearly be

A good example of this would be if a

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

preempted because it interferes with the administration

2

of the plan.

3

shouldn't per se be preempted because it enacted the

4

second law that is preempted because it's interfering

5

with the administration of the plan.

6

But the first law would still be fine.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It

Once again, the divorce

7

exception blows away that -- that explanation, that all

8

Congress is concerned about is efficient administration

9

of the plan so long as the insurer will know.

You know,

10

just look at the -- look at the -- at the contract, the

11

named beneficiary, pay the money to the named

12

beneficiary, and you're home free.

13

blown away by the exception for divorce decrees.

14

insurer is going to have to check that there hasn't been

15

a divorce since the contract was signed, right?

16

MR. RUTTENBERG:

That -- that is
The

Well, they're -- they're

17

not going to have to check unless it's been properly

18

filed, but --

19
20
21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

They have to check

to see if it has been properly filed, right?
MR. RUTTENBERG:

Yes, yes.

But the Federal

22

Government has no -- it -- there is no interest that the

23

Federal Government would have in saying that a divorce

24

decree that was properly filed has -- should be --

25

should be honored, but one that hasn't been properly
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

filed shouldn't be.

2

They want State laws there.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but quite apart

3

from -- from that, it -- it seems to me that under your

4

proposal the Congress would actually have accepted a

5

situation where one spouse sues a former spouse.

6

other words, you have a -- that's the whole design of

7

this statute.

In

Would the insurance company -- if you were

9

representing the insurance company, would you tell the

10

insurance company that they were completely safe in

11

paying the benefits to the first spouse even if there's

12

going to be a suit afterwards?

13

MR. RUTTENBERG:

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Or would the insurance

15

company itself be under some liability?

16

24

whether under State law the insurance company, if it --

25

if it knows this doesn't have some duty to refrain from
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

making the payment or to put it in escrow or to

2

interplead.

3

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Not at all.

The statute's

4

specifically written so that the former spouse becomes

5

personally liable to the widow or whoever was entitled

6

to it.

7

It's designed to make the -JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And if you're representing

8

the insurance company, you wouldn't say you better

9

interplead to be on the safe side?

10

MR. RUTTENBERG:

I think this Court can

11

establish the -- I think they have established under the

12

Kennedy case that they have a duty to pay the designated

13

beneficiary.

14

whether or -- it was very clear that the insurance --

15

the plan administrator has to pay.

16

there is no concern at all for the insurance company.

17

In Kennedy, with regards to ERISA and

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So I think that

Mr. Ruttenberg, how do

18

you get to this notion that administrative convenience

19

is all that is involved?

20

employee's life insurance and the Government is saying

21

to the employee, the beneficiary is your free choice,

22

you can pick anyone, your spouse, a charity, it's your

23

choice, but we want you to know that, although you make

24

it and you can change it any time you want, if you don't

25

change it that will be it.

After all, this is an

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

That -- so it's giving, the employee,

2

control over the proceeds of his or her life insurance.

3

Why isn't that a purpose along with administrative

4

convenience?

5

MR. RUTTENBERG:

I believe that the purpose

6

of FEGLIA was -- the other main stated purpose is that

7

Congress was trying to offer life insurance similar to

8

what was being offered by private companies, and they're

9

acting as an employer in this regard.

And just like

10

with private group life insurance, most people think

11

that the beneficiary designations are going to control

12

where that money goes and -- and the same with FEGLIA.

13

But also, most everyone expects when they

14

get divorced that their assets are going to be subject

15

to State divorce law.

16

Congress wasn't concerned with employees carrying out

17

their responsibilities to their families.

18

suggesting Congress is using the State law.

19

doesn't want to be the one that makes sure that those

20

responsibilities are carried out.

21

State law and they've developed a scheme that allows

22

State law to help make sure those duties are carried

23

out.

24
25

And I'm not suggesting that

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm
Congress

They're relying on

If an insured, after making

a designation of a beneficiary, writes a will and leaves
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the insurance proceeds to a different person, the

2

Federal law would still, as interpreted by the State

3

Supreme Court, require the money to be paid to the

4

designated beneficiary, wouldn't it?

5

MR. RUTTENBERG:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
And what does that say about

7

Congress's supposed desire to ensure that the money goes

8

to the person that the insured wants it to go to?

9

MR. RUTTENBERG:

Well, Justice Alito, after

10

the money has been paid out in a case like that, it is

11

possible that there are State laws involved that -- that

12

would allow someone to have a suit -- institute a suit

13

against who received that.

14

OPM or MetLife to have anything to do with that.

15

just want OPM and MetLife to be able to do the job of --

16

of paying out the designated.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

But Congress doesn't want
They

Well, the point is if

18

Congress's objective, if one of its objectives in

19

addition to administrative convenience was to effectuate

20

the will of the insured, then I don't see why it would

21

provide for Federal law to override a subsequent will

22

which directly expresses the desire of the insured.

23
24
25

MR. RUTTENBERG:
that.

I don't think FEGLIA says

What it says is -JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You would agree with

15
Alderson Reporting Company

that?

2

just said?

I assume you would agree with what Justice Alito

3

MR. RUTTENBERG:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5
6

Yes.
That it has only to do

with administrative convenience?
MR. RUTTENBERG:

Well, I don't want to say

7

that it has only to do with that.

8

the -- that's the reason, though, that everything ends

9

once the benefits are paid out.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's one of the --

Why should this scheme be

11

treated differently than the National Service Life

12

Insurance and the successor law in Wissner and Ridgway?

13

Those operated the same way.

14

designates is who gets it and if you -- the only way

15

you can change it is to have a change of beneficiary

16

form filed with your employer, if you don't do that,

17

whatever you've said is where the money goes.

18

MR. RUTTENBERG:

They said the person who

There's -- there's a -- you

19

have to compare the FEGLIA and the SGLIA to get the

20

intent of Congress.

21

look at the text of FEGLIA and it should look at the

22

legislative history, and there's five main differences I

23

can point to which suggest that Congress intended

24

something different.

25

You want to -- this Court should

The first is that FEGLIA doesn't have an
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

anti-attachment provision.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the two decisions

3

that dealt with the anti-attachment, they gave that as

4

an alternative ground of decision.

5

separate and discrete from saying what's on the

6

beneficiary, the designation that controls.

7

say, and also there's this anti-attachment.

8
9

MR. RUTTENBERG:

It was quite

And they

Absolutely, Your Honor.

But when it did the holding regarding the order of

10

precedence, it didn't just look at the order of

11

precedence.

12

the differing provisions, and one of the provisions I

13

think that indicates Congress's intent in SGLIA is the

14

anti-attachment provision.

15

It looked at all of SGLIA and it looked at

So if the second holding was not there at

16

all with regards strictly to the anti-attachment

17

provision, Ridgway still would have held the way it held

18

because it was looking at all of SGLIA.

19

But that's not the only difference.

There's

20

also the divorce provision which they have in Federal

21

group life insurance and they -- they didn't put that

22

into the servicemen's group life.

23

people assign their benefits.

24

preemption provision in FEGLIA which they didn't feel

25

was needed in SGLIA.

They let FEGLIA

There's a limited express

And when you -17

3

an afterthought.

4

main brief.

5

you didn't put it in the appendix to your main brief.

I think you did not put it in your

It came up only in your reply brief, and

6

MR. RUTTENBERG:

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

8
9

That's correct, Your Honor.
So you -- you seem to

assign lesser importance to it.
MR. RUTTENBERG:

I do assign less importance

10

to the assignment provision than I would to the -- the

11

lack of an anti-attachment provision or the -- the

12

divorce provision or the express preemption provision or

13

even the legislative history.

14

it is a factor to be looked at.

15

But I do still think that

And in this case, again pointing to the Rose

16

case, in the Rose case, they were dealing with the same

17

anti-attachment provision in Rose and even there

18

determined that Congress did not intend that those

19

dollars should be kept away from the -- the family

20

members in that case.

21

So I would again analogize that to this case

22

because in the Rose case, they specifically

23

distinguished those two cases on those grounds.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I keep -- I keep coming

back to the explicit divorce provision, which says when
18
Alderson Reporting Company

1

there's a divorce decree, only properly filed, it,

2

without a change by the beneficiary, goes to the new

3

wife, okay.

4

5

money so long as there is a State law that says all --

6

all proceeds from insurance companies for policies

7

entered into before the -- before the -- the decedent

8

was divorced will go to the new wife.

9

And you're telling us that even without a

It seems to me that is such a -- such a

10

blatant frustration of the -- not just the purpose of --

11

of the very text of the divorce provision in the law,

12

which says only if there is a decree properly filed will

13

it go to the new wife.

14

doesn't really matter so long as there's a State law

15

which says it will go to the new wife without a -- you

16

know.

17

And you're saying, well, it

MR. RUTTENBERG:

There -- there are two --

two points I'd like to make there.

19

Congress was trying to get involved in the field of

20

divorce.

21

saying all other domestic relations laws don't apply, we

22

only want to apply these laws.

23

domestic relations laws like community property rights

if their parents didn't know enough to file those

2

things.

3

that's what Congress was trying to do there with that

4

provision.

So the first point is that I don't think that

5

And the second point is that it's not a

6

superfluous provision.

7

would much rather file it with the court so that I knew

8

it would get paid directly to me than have to deal with

9

it after it's been paid out.

If I had a divorce decree, I

So I think it is -- it

10

absolutely serves a purpose, but it doesn't serve the

11

purpose of trying to -- to get -- I think Congress was

12

trying to make a statement, we want these benefits to be

13

subject to State laws, not that we want these

14

benefits --

18

21

If that was Congress's intent, why limit it to a

Why not just simply say in 80 --

MR. RUTTENBERG:

I believe that's basically

22

what they did because the other type of court orders

23

such as a waiver wouldn't make sense to put in there.

24

You -- you would not -- if I was paying attention if

25

I -- if I had filed -- if I had a divorce decree that
20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

said my ex-wife waived a right to my insurance, it

2

doesn't make sense that I'd do that additional filing

3

because that wouldn't add anything to it.

4

So Congress was saying that court orders can

5

-- that direct where money goes does that.

6

other types of laws, like community property laws or

7

waivers or this type of law, they would have to have a

8

separate section for each of them to draft it in such a

9

way that it wouldn't interfere -- it would make it easy

10

And the

on OPM to know where to pay the money.

11

And I think what they were doing is they

12

weren't saying any types of State laws can come in

13

because they didn't -- they wanted to deal with the ones

14

that were clear, that were easy for them to deal with,

15

so that they -- so that OPM and MetLife knows where to

16

pay the money.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Ruttenberg, what

18

Thank you, counsel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MR. STEFFEN N. JOHNSON
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. JOHNSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
On two separate occasions, this Court has

12

held that order of precedence provisions like those

13

found in FEGLIA grant the insured an absolute personal

14

right to, quote, "direct that the proceeds belong to the

15

named beneficiary and no other."

16

In fact, Congress enacted FEGLIA just four

17

years after this Court's decision in Wissner, where this

18

Court held that the MISLA order of precedence was the

19

controlling section of the Act, was forceful and clear

20

in defining the scope of this Federal right, preempted

21

post-distribution efforts to nullify the insured's

22

choice, quote, "whether directed at the very money it

23

received from the Government or an equivalent amount."

24

And Ridgway, of course, extended Wissner to SGLIA, which

25

contains the very same text at issue here.

Now, for a number of reasons we think that

2

this case is even easier than Wissner and Ridgway.

First of all, we are not dealing with the generally

applicable body of law, we are dealing with something

JUSTICE ALITO:

what other objective do you think Congress was trying to

16

able to provide benefits, life insurance proceeds, to

17

the person of their choice.

what the better policy default is, but when you have a

This Court has taken a very practical and

realistic approach to issues of preemption in a -- in a

we said, the Court said, that -- that it's not simply a

19

matter of semantics.

20

Court's precedents involving U.S. savings bonds, there

21

was a dispute between the husband of the decedent, who

22

had an absolute right of survivorship under Federal laws

The only real difference

Wissner --

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I guess the question,

12

Mr. Johnson, is whether we just got it wrong there.

13

Because if you look at this statute, it seems -- you

14

know, if you were just doing it as a matter of first

15

impression, that what Congress wanted was a clear and

16

uniform rule to allow it to pay benefits quickly and

17

easily without any discussion or investigation of a

18

person's true intent.

19

But that after that, why does Congress have

20

an interest any further?

says, really, we think the better measure of intent is

22

something else, then we should let the State go ahead

23

with their law.

24

MR. JOHNSON:

And if a State has a law that

It's conceivable, Your Honor,

of language and -- and a similar language is adopted in

unless Congress says otherwise.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But here --

Yes, I guess -- I guess you

might -- you might respond also that, you know, it's

7

what's the best discernment of intent, in the natural

assessment of what's -- what's the clearest expression

16

of intent, right?

And here you have a Federal

17

I don't know why it's a family law provision

18

as much as it is a provision of what the presumed intent

19

of -- of a decedent is.

20

21

statute, and I don't know why it isn't intruding upon

as the Court's repeatedly said, where you have

4

conflicting means, you have preemption.

assumption about intent, and then based on that

7

assumption, the rule is automatic.

If that is the purpose behind it, Congress

But Section D
It makes an

So whether it's a statute about intent, it's
preempted because Congress says the best evidence of

10

intent is what you do on the beneficiary form, or

11

whether it's about -- about divorce, it's preempted

12

because Congress has spoken to when divorce will affect

13

the enjoyment of proceeds by the beneficiary.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Johnson, there are at

15

least one case where the State law would override the

16

beneficiary designation and that's obviously if the

17

beneficiary murdered the -- the insured.

18

this scheme to displace the beneficiary designated in

that --

MR. JOHNSON:

So how does

Is

Your Honor, I believe -- I do

22

agree with the premise of your question was that the --

which is that the Slayer would not be paid.

24

that is, I think, as follows.

The path to

I think if the Slayer

going to speak to -- it's going to relate to life

2

insurance and the express preemption provision would

3

probably kick in and it would call for a different

4

result, it would be preempted.

5

But there's a longstanding Federal common

6

law rule, and the lower courts addressing this situation

7

have also held that -- that that informs the Federal

8

statute here.

9

1886 decision, National Mutual Life Insurance v.

The leading case from this Court is an

10

Armstrong, and it is such a well-established rule that I

11

think Congress can be viewed as having incorporated that

12

rule under the statute by not having specifically

13

overridden it.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So you would get there by

15

a Federal common law rule, but then who would get the

proceeds?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELAINE J. GOLDENBERG,

10

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

11

SUPPORTING RESPONDENT

12
13

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

14

Section D seeks to substitute a new

15

beneficiary in place of the one that Federal law

16

mandates, and it does that through an attempted end run

17

around Federal preemption.

18

talking about the purpose of the Federal law, which

19

several of the Court's prior questions spoke to.

20

I'd like to start off by

The purpose here is to get benefits to the

21

designated beneficiary for that person's beneficial

22

enjoyment.

23

very similar language in Ridgway and Wissner.

24

that's --

That's the purpose that the Court found in

3

her enjoyment.

but it's going to be -- have to go through bankruptcy,

5

it's going to have to go through other claims like any

6

other property under State law.

7

Obviously, the benefit becomes the

She may want to spend it on something,

MS. GOLDENBERG:

That's true, Your Honor,

8

but the designated beneficiary is benefiting in a sense

9

when that money is used to pay that person's

10

obligations.

11

anti-attachment provision here, the designated

12

beneficiary could be subject to a contracts judgment, a

13

tort judgment, it could have to pay other outstanding

14

obligations that that person has.

So we don't deny that because there's no

1

beneficiary where there is a very clear expression of

2

intent on the part of the insured that the money go

3

someplace else?

4

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Well, I think there are a

5

number of purposes served by that, and that speaks to

6

the will question that Your Honor asked earlier.

7

For one thing, it creates certainty in the

8

process, not only for the insured, but also for the

9

beneficiary, who's not going to have to face some kind

10

of long legal contest over the money that may eat up the

11

proceeds in attorney's fees and costs.

12

And that was a purpose that Congress

13

specifically articulated when it made the 1966 amendment

14

to the statute.

15

It also --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

These arguments seem to be

17

circular.

18

making sure that the designated beneficiary gets the

19

money instead of the person whom the insured has

20

subsequently and very clearly said he or she wants to

21

get the money is to make sure that the designated

22

beneficiary gets the money, and gets it without any

23

hassle.

network of rules set up by the Federal Government that

is there might be fraudulent wills?

MS. GOLDENBERG:

It's possible that if you

are looking outside the designated -- the beneficiary

designation form, that you may have people trying to

come up with some other expressions of intent.

15

confusion.

16

starkly illustrated when you think about what somebody

17

who designated their spouse and got divorced and then

18

wanted to keep that person as their beneficiary would

19

hear from the Federal Government if they went and said,

Now, that person's intent would be overridden by section

D, which would essentially pluck the benefits right out

3

of the hand of the ex-spouse that that person meant them

And that makes essentially the focus of the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL H. RUTTENBERG

21

about domestic relations laws not applying after that,

22

and that's exactly what -- this Court found in Egelhoff.

23

Another -- another point that my friend made

24

was with regard to Servicemen's Group Life Insurance and

25

the holding in Ridgway was based on the fact that these

And you can't say that in this case because

6

those proceeds can belong to -- there's express

7

enactments which allow you to assign it, and allow a

9

So it can't be said in -- with FEGLIA that those

10

proceeds belong to the designated beneficiary to the

11

exclusion of all others.

12

And the example that Mr. Chief Justice gave

13

with regard to bankruptcy, the -- in the case of a

14

bankruptcy, that's not benefiting the designated

beneficiary because all their debts are being discharged

I also wanted to address one of Justice

Scalia's comments.

20

this is not a divorce law and is not subject to the

21

preemption.

22

there were I think two reasons he suggested that.

23

was it's a Federal act, and they applied in Ridgway,

24

which was dealing with the Federal Act, the Servicemen's

And this Court's case in Egelhoff also

3

recognized that the statute, very similar section A, the

4

Washington version of section A, was a divorce/probate

5

type of law, both of which are historical police powers.

6

The -- the only other comment I would like

7

to make is with regard to the Slayer statutes.

8

State Slayer statutes are drafted with the identical

9

language of section D, which says if preempted, then
