We will hear

Mr. Johnson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN B. JOHNSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. JOHNSON:

10

may it please the Court:

11

May it -- Mr. Chief Justice,

In this case -- it doesn't matter what my

12

client was convicted of in 1978, in the State of

13

California.

14

Criminal Act is what he's convicted of.

15

know, when you're -- to be convicted of a crime,

16

elements have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt or

17

agreed to by a defendant after waiving his

18

constitutional rights.

19

What's important for the Armed Career
And as we all

In California, burglary -- unlawful entry as

20

defined by the Court in Taylor on what a generic

21

burglary consists of, is not an element of California

22

burglary.

23

a theft, or a felony will do.

24

never required to actually find unlawful entry in the

25

Taylor sense.

Any entry with the intent to commit a crime,
A California jury is

1

Regardless of the defendant's conduct, a

2

California burglary conviction is not, by its elements,

3

Taylor burglary for Armed Career Criminal Act.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You don't take issue, do

5

you, with the argument that in -- in determining what

6

the State law is you can take account not only of the

7

words of the statute, but how the State Supreme Court

8

interprets those words?

9

MR. JOHNSON:

I -- I don't take issue with

10

that, Your Honor.

11

courts clearly state something is an element of a crime,

12

I -- you know, I agree with that.

13

I think if the State's -- State

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the California Supreme

14

Court has said that an element of the burglary statute

15

is the violation of some possessory interest.

16

know there is some disagreement between you and the

17

government about that.

18

argument that that is an element, one way for the

19

California court to express that is to say simply, as it

20

has, that an element is the violation of the possessory

21

interest.

22

Now, I

But assuming for the sake of

Another way of saying exactly the same thing

23

would be to say that the term "enters" under the

24

California burglary statute means either breaking into a

25

structure or the violation of the possessory interest in
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

some other way.

2

MR. JOHNSON:

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.
Those are exactly

4

equivalent.

Now, if they were to say the latter, would

5

a conviction under this statute potentially qualify

6

under the Armed Career Criminal Act?

7

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, I don't believe it

8

would, because I don't believe possessory interest

9

equates to Taylor definition.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10

No, but they -- they set out

11

alternative elements, either breaking into the structure

12

or the violation of the possessory interest in some

13

other way.

14

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, if -- if the elements

15

are shown, and if that's the definition, then yes.

16

I don't think California possessory interest is the same

17

thing.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

No, but they have said -- do

19

you dispute the fact that saying A, an element is the

20

violation of the possessory interest, and B, the

21

elements are breaking or the violation of the possessory

22

interest in some other way, are exactly the same

23

substantively?

24
25

MR. JOHNSON:

I -- I don't, Your Honor,

because in the Taylor sense you have to have an -5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

unlawful -- trespass, actually a trespass, or an

2

invasion of a person's -- well, unlawful trespass.

3

California you don't have to have a trespass.

4

the Court indicated in the Taylor decision, it talked

5

about shoplifting in the State of California.

6

shoplifter someone who should be subject to an Armed

7

Career Criminal Act enhancement?

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

In

And as

So is a

I thought your argument was

that if the terms of the statute set out alternative

10

ways of satisfying an element, you have alternative

11

elements in essence, that then, even if some of those

12

alternatives don't fall within generic burglary, if one

13

does, then a conviction under that statute potentially

14

can qualify.

15

MR. JOHNSON:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MR. JOHNSON:

18

Well, I -Isn't that -- do you not --- I have no argument with

that.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. JOHNSON:

21
22

Okay.
That's the modified

categorical approach, I believe.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Alright.

Now, what if the

23

State Supreme Court says exactly the same thing?

24

answer to Justice Ginsburg was it doesn't matter whether

25

the elements are set out in the statute or whether they
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Your

Official

1

are defined by the State court.

2

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, I -- as I said, if -- if

3

the element is set forth and it's an element that meets

4

the definition of the generic definition in Taylor, then

5

I agree with you.

6

burglary does that, because the entry with intent to

7

commit a crime is burglary in California.

8
9

But I don't believe California

JUSTICE ALITO:
one more time.

Well, I'll ask the question

Is there a difference -- what the

10

California court has said is that an element is the

11

violation of a possessory interest.

12

sake of argument that is correct, that is a correct

13

statement of California law, is there any substantive

14

difference between saying that and saying the element is

15

breaking or, in the alternative, the violation of a

16

possessory interest in some other way?

17

substantive difference between those two things?

18

MR. JOHNSON:

Assuming for the

Is there some

Well, there may not be a

19

substantive difference, but in California breaking is

20

not required at any time.

21

crime.

22

It's not an element of the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Johnson, can I try what

23

Justice Alito is getting at maybe in a slightly a

24

different way?

25

Ninth Circuit made, which is that you can take any

And it's really the argument that the

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

indivisible statute -- indivisible statute, and you can

2

reimagine it as a statute with divisible elements, and

3

Justice Alito gave one example of that.

4

question that the Ninth Circuit says, is, once we've said

5

that we can look to Shepard documents when we have a

6

divisible statute, why not apply the same reasoning when

7

we have an indivisible statute, given that any

8

indivisible statute can kind of be reframed in our heads

9

as a divisible one?

10

MR. JOHNSON:

And the

Well, because in -- in that

11

case, the jury -- if a statute is made where the

12

question is, is a weapon involved, and you can commit

13

that with an ax, a gun, or a knife, but the element is

14

weapon, the jury is only required to find weapon.

15

if gun is -- is the fact that needs to be shown for an

16

active -- predicate, you don't get there.

17

Again, you go back to the element, what's

18

the person convicted of.

19

weapon violation, not a gun violation.

20

suggest it's the same thing here.

21

And

They'd be convicted of a

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And so, I -- I

But I thought our cases

22

held that when you have a conviction for a weapons

23

violation, you can look to the Shepard materials to

24

decide whether, in fact, the weapon violation was a gun,

25

a knife or an ax, can't you?

No?

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. JOHNSON:

If the State's statute sets

2

off those as an alternative element, I would agree with

3

that.

4

element, then I don't think they are -- I think they are

5

a manner and means of committing the crime.

6

think they are an element of the crime.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If they are not set out in an alternative

I don't

Or if -- you acknowledge if

8

the State supreme court says "weapon" could mean a -- a

9

gun, a knife or a hatchet, that would -- that would

10

suffice, right?

11

that, we cannot imagine it?

12

But if the supreme court doesn't say

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, I -- if it's spelled out

13

as an element, I think you can, but if it's not an

14

element -JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

It's not spelled out as an

16

element, but the State supreme court says, our statute

17

says weapon.

18

knife, or a hatchet, and then we look to the Shepard

19

documents and we find that this conviction of a weapon

20

violation was in fact based on the possession of a gun.

21
22

Of course, a weapon could be a gun, a

MR. JOHNSON:

Again, I think it would go

back to the element of -- of weapon --

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem is there's no

24

way.

This is purely conceptual.

A State supreme

25

court that says the word "weapon" in the statute means
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

knife, ax, or gun.

2

committing the crime?

3

with a separate element?

4

5

dancing on the head of a pin.

6

Now, are those three ways of
Or are they three crimes, each
That is -- we'd need not only

There is no difference that I can imagine.

7

And therefore you are saying, look to the point of this

8

statute; it is not to look to the individual way in

9

which it was committed, and therefore go to the statute

10

to see whether you have a single crime or separate

11

crimes, okay?

12

is.

That's that's what I think your argument

13

MR. JOHNSON:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

It -- it is.
Do you think I understand

your argument?

16

MR. JOHNSON:

I think you do.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Fine.

If I understand your

18

argument -- it's not as friendly a question as you might

19

hope--

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- because what I want to

22

do next is say, why are we debating this point, because

23

the only difference I can see under the California

24

statute is shoplifting and even that one is sort of

25

debatable.

And the very next clause of this statute
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

says "or otherwise," "or otherwise involves conduct that

2

presents a serious potential risk of physical injury."

3

So, why not forget about this metaphysical point

4

and say, look, even if you are totally right, you've

5

still got a statute that for 430,000 convictions and as far

6

as we can tell there must have been fewer than 500 that

7

involved shoplifting, so this is so much like burglary,

8

that whatever risks were presented by burglary are

9

surely present here.

So let's forget the metaphysics

10

and just go on to clause 2.

11

done that?

12

and they haven't.

13

Now, why hasn't anybody

It's a mystery to me, because you haven't
So why not?

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, it's not my burden to do

14

that.

And -- I expected that question, but I think even

15

under -- under the residual clause we win the case.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. JOHNSON:

18

Why?

Because in California a

shoplifter is not -- but I would think --

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

But I mean,

20

what I would do -- I've said this and nobody pays any

21

attention.

22

pays any attention.

23

said, look, under clause 2, these are really empirical

24

questions, is this dangerous or not.

25

sampling and what we'll do is we'll sample the kinds of

I think Justice Scalia's said it; nobody
I think Justice Posner said it.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

He

Let's do a little

Official

1

people that this particular State statute X get

2

convicted under and where a whole lot of them are

3

dangerous it's a dangerous statute; and where not, not.

4

And so nobody's done that sampling, but we do have some

5

numbers here and the numbers here suggest that this is

6

really a burglary statute.

7

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, there's -- there's other

8

ways other than just shoplifting.

9

a mortgage broker going into a home with an invitation.
JUSTICE BREYER:

10

There -- for example,

Yes, you could.

I just

11

don't think there are that many people who burgle their

12

own homes or who go into the home of somebody else with

13

an invitation and then sneak into the cupboard and stay

14

overnight and burgle everything.

15

such, but --

16

MR. JOHNSON:

I mean, there are some

Doesn't it come back to the

17

test that this Court thought Congress meant when you

18

made the ruling in Taylor that we're not going to look

19

to the manner and means of commission, we're going to

20

look at the elements --

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

It doesn't

22

have to do with that.

It has to do with the crime and

23

the crime is the crime that the statute defines.

24

the question is, is that crime otherwise -- present a

25

serious potential risk of physical injury?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

And

And if 4,000

Official

1

manifestations of that crime it does, and 3

2

manifestations of that crime it doesn't, you would say

3

the overall judgment here is this is a crime that does

4

present that dangerous risk.

5

all cases it's there.

6

MR. JOHNSON:

That's because in almost

Well, if the Taylor definition

7

-- after the Court worked that through, I think the

8

Taylor went with the categorical elements approach.

9

think what you're talking, Your Honor, is -- is a

10

I

different approach.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

It's exactly pure

12

categorical.

13

know how dangerous it is.

14

explosives.

15

of danger you do a little empirical research.

16

all I'm saying.

17

You have a crime in a statute.

You don't

It is not burglary, arson or

So to find out if it presents the same kind
That's

It has nothing to do with categorical.

MR. JOHNSON:

But then why do we have the

18

"is burglary" language and the other sentences?

19

they get eaten up by that?
JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Don't

"Is burglary or otherwise,"

21

"or otherwise," "burglary or otherwise," and the reason

22

we have "or otherwise" is because Congress does know

23

that the number of State statutes that are sort of like

24

something, but not completely like something is in the

25

thousands.

And so that's why they put in "or
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

otherwise."
MR. JOHNSON:

I think in this case one of

3

the -- one of the considerations that drives our

4

argument is that if you get into that fact-finding mode

5

of manner and means in order to establish an element

6

that is not in the State statute, which is in the case

7

we're looking at here, I think you got an Apprendi

8

problem, and I think under the Sixth Amendment my client

9

should have had a right to a jury trial and proof beyond

10

a reasonable doubt.

11

He went from a max 10 to a max of life and a

12

mandatory min of 15 years, based on what I -- we contend

13

is fact-finding in violation of Apprendi.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose the Court were to

15

say, we now hold that the modified categorical approach

16

applies to this statute and to these facts.

17

plea colloquy suffice to show that under the modified

18

categorical approach the defendant necessarily was

19

convicted of a crime that's equivalent to the generic

20

crime of burglary?

21

MR. JOHNSON:

Would the

Well, I think the breaking

22

under the -- under the California statute is a manner

23

and means of committing the crime.

24

of the crime, because you don't have to --

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It's not an element

But if he necessarily --

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. JOHNSON:

-- do that.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- the defendant

3

necessarily was convicted of an offense that had the

4

elements of a generic crime, if he necessarily was

5

convicted of that, would that suffice?

6

does the -- plea colloquy suffice to show that?

7
8

MR. JOHNSON:

That's kind of a two-part

question.

9
10

And if it would,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It is a two-part question.

I hope I can get an answer to each.

11

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, the first question is,

12

because the breaking is not part of California

13

requirement, a jury's never required to find that as an

14

element.

15

to -- to find that having taken place.

16

Nor does a judge when he's taking a plea have

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if under the modified

17

categorical approach we -- we insist that in the

18

particular case before us the generic components of the

19

crime must necessarily have been found by the jury, and

20

if we say that that's the rule, that's inconsistent with

21

your view of what the law ought to be?

22

MR. JOHNSON:

I think -- I think it would

23

be, because I think unless it -- unless it -- there are

24

alternatives in the statute, some of which constitute

25

the generic crime and some of which don't, I don't think
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

you can use a modified categorical approach.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think what you're saying

3

is, it -- it could necessarily have been found by the

4

jury, but he would nevertheless not have been convicted

5

of that particular crime.

6

MR. JOHNSON:

That's obviously a more --

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The jury in finding him

8

guilty of the generic offense could only have found that

9

this mode of committing the offense was what he used.

10

Nonetheless, he has not been convicted of using that

11

mode; he has been convicted of the generic offense.

12

Isn't that your point.

13

MR. JOHNSON:

Exactly true.

Just like for

14

an example would be in a plea bargain context the

15

prosecutor charges a person with delivery of a

16

controlled substance, maybe there is a problem with the

17

search or something and they come up with a plea bargain

18

of possession of a controlled substance.

19

to 30 years later go back and say, well, the colloquy

20

says this person did do a delivery, so we are going to

21

punish him as if he did?

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are we going

But under the modified

23

categorical approach the whole point is that we do look

24

to the plea colloquy.

25

MR. JOHNSON:

You look to the plea
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

colloquy --

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, which is why

3

you say you don't think the modified categorical

4

approach should apply.

5

that it does and we look at the plea colloquy.

6

you want us to conclude from that?

7
8

But I'm saying suppose we say

MR. JOHNSON:

What do

Even if you say it does, it

still doesn't -- it's not an element of the crime.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you simplify that?

10

Could you simplify that?

11

of -- just going back to what Justice Scalia said, as I

12

understand your position the elements of a burglary in

13

California law is being in a place with the intent to

14

commit a crime.

15

or without permission, unlawfully or not, is irrelevant.

16

So what you are saying is what he pled guilty to was

17

being in that garage with the intent to commit a crime,

18

correct?

19

What do you think the elements

Whether you got there with permission

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

In California you --

20

just entry with intent is all you need, with intent to

21

commit.

22
23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
not necessary.

24
25

But the unlawfulness is

MR. JOHNSON:

It's not necessary and that's

the point -17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No matter what he said,

2

he wasn't convicted of a generic crime because all he

3

was convicted of under California law was entering

4

and --

5

MR. JOHNSON:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7
8
9

Exactly.
-- with intent.

That's

your point.
MR. JOHNSON:

And the manner and means of --

of committing it isn't the point.

It's what are you

10

convicted of.

11

decides to change that approach, I think we're going to

12

have an Apprendi problem.

13

And again, I think unless the Court

JUSTICE ALITO:

But your argument comes back

14

to how the elements are defined.

15

your view, what is critical is in a case of a broad

16

statute -- whether the statute simply sets out a broad

17

category or whether it sets out lots of subcategories,

18

that's what your argument comes down to.

19

It comes back -- so in

If the court says -- if the California

20

legislature or the California court says, the element is

21

entry, period, that's one thing.

22

element is breaking or entering in some other way,

23

that's something entirely different.

24

to that, in your view.

25

MR. JOHNSON:

If they say the

It all comes down

Well, it may -- it may come
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

down to what -- what the Court thinks California means

2

by invasion of a possessory interest.

3

-- I don't see invasion of a possessory interest as the

4

equivalent of Taylor entry.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

But again, I just

Because it's like the old

6

joke.

I mean, it's in the statute, you are looking back

7

to see whether he was charged with possession of a gun,

8

which is one word in the statute, or an ax, or a knife.

9

That's what we're looking for under the categorical --

10

modified categorical.

11

is weapon, even if the supreme court says it's a gun, a

12

knife, or an ax, you still have nothing to look for.

13

Because the charge to the jury could have been, did he

14

question, when the jury comes back, would be yes.

sums it up.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if that's your

23

argument, then you're really asking for us to modify our

24

prior cases.

25

the element -- if the statute requires -- if to qualify

Because I thought it was clear, that if

19
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

under ACCA, you have to have a gun.

2

says that you have to have a weapon, and a weapon is

3

defined as a gun, a knife, or a hatchet, that would be

4

okay.

5

agree with that?

Is that wrong?

6

And the statute

Isn't that your -- don't you

MR. JOHNSON:

If the predicate element is

7

included in the -- in the statute or the decision, I

8

agree with that.

9
10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So your answer to

Justice Breyer was not yes; it was no.

11
12

But again, I don't think I have to --

MR. JOHNSON:
question.

Maybe I misunderstood the

But I think the --

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

You didn't.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let's -- let's get back

15

to this case.

16

colloquy is, even if he had said to the judge, yes, I

17

broke and entered the Metro Mart, even if he had said

18

that, the conviction still would not be for burglary.

19

I think what you're saying about the plea

MR. JOHNSON:

The conviction is for just

20

entry, and for the entry with intent, which again isn't

21

how this Court defined burglary in Taylor.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so --

And your principal

23

argument isn't that -- is that what we've said in the

24

modified categorical cases is that you look to these

25

Shepard documents to help you define the element of the
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offense.

So if you're not sure which offense the person

2

has been convicted of, you look to the Shepard documents

3

to do that.

4

for a different purpose, which is, we know what the

5

elements of the offense are, but we want to know whether

6

this person also committed the generic offense.

7

But you don't look to the Shepard documents

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

Yes.

I agree with that.

8

And -- but the government wants you to use the Shepard

9

documents to go beyond that.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Yes, but -- here's, I

11

guess, the rub, which is -- you know, I take the point

12

that what the Ninth Circuit has said does not seem very

13

categorical.

14

seem modified categorical.

15

little bit insane about your position.

16

you take the most populous State in the country and

17

everybody who's convicted of burglary, in the most

18

populous State in the country, is not going to have

19

committed an ACCA offense, even though, as Justice

20

Breyer suggested, 98 percent of them really have.

21

It doesn't seem categorical, it doesn't

MR. JOHNSON:

But there is something a
I don't see --

There's an -- there's an easy

22

way to fix that.

A State legislature can change their

23

law, if they want to.

24

approach they want to take, and that would -- that would

25

solve that problem.

The Congress can change the

But I don't think it's up to the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Court to change 22 years of jurisprudence to do that.

2

California has known this for over 22 years.

3

problems have been -- have been around and percolating,

4

and the right to a jury on -- on issues of fact --

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it's not

6

California's problem, right?

7

Federal legislation and how that operates.

8
9

MR. JOHNSON:

These

We're talking about

I agree.

So Congress can

amend the statute if they wish, as many members of the

10

Court have talked to the Court and asked the Court to

11

do.

12

the law, and the categorical approach, and the idea was

13

that using the modified categorical approach would only

14

apply in a narrow set of circumstances, the

15

California -- or the Ninth Circuit's version is not a

16

narrow set of circumstances.

17

But in light of how I believe this Court interprets

Arguably, it's just about any crime that

18

comes in -- later on, sometimes decades later, they're

19

going to be doing fact-finding on issues, some of the

20

participants might have passed away.

21

of things like that.

22

defendant under those circumstances that that kind of

23

fact-finding is going to take place and result in the

24

egregious extra penalties he's looking at unless he has

are facts about the conviction.

get it.

6

be narrow.

7

I think that's the

I think the other circuits

They get the idea modified categorical should

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's -- there's

8

probably an obvious answer to this, but the Taylor

9

definition of generic burglary is unlawful entry into or

10

remaining in a building with intent to commit a crime.

11

Why doesn't this, the crime of which the defendant was

12

convicted, satisfy the remaining, the remaining in the

13

building with intent to commit a crime?

14

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, California burglary

15

is -- I believe, in my reading of the case law, it's --

16

the -- the intent is formed as you enter the premises.

17

And that's when the burglary's been committed.

18

for example, that's the way I read the case law.

19
20
21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If --

That -- that intent would

continue while the person remains in the building.
MR. JOHNSON:

Well, except the -- again, is

22

it the intent in the generic sense, or is it the intent

23

in the California sense?

24

difference, because again, I don't believe -- invading a

25

possessory interest, I think that came up when someone

And I suggest there's a

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

was convicted, or they tried to convict them of

2

burglarizing their own home, and the person had a

3

possessory interest so they said oh, you can't be guilty

4

of that.

5

equates to the generic Taylor element.

6
7

I just -- I don't think possessory interest

And I would like to reserve my time, if I
might.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Horwich.

Thank you, counsel.

10

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MR. HORWICH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

14

I would like to start maybe at a point in a

15

colloquy that my friend was having with Justice Breyer,

16

which brought out the point that Petitioner's position

17

here is that there's a difference between alternative

18

elements in State crimes and alternative means; and from

19

the point of view of a guilty plea, which is what we're

20

dealing with here, I don't see how you're going to make

21

that sort of distinction.

22

It's an unworkable distinction, because,

23

from -- from the point of view of the defendant pleading

24

guilty, whether it's an alternative element or an

25

alternative means, it's just an alternative way of
24
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

offering the factual basis for the crime.

2

sentencing court ought to look, as the Court, as this

3

Court said in Shepard, to the factual basis that's

4

offered for pleading guilty.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

And the

But you're not -- but

6

you're not looking at the factual basis for the purpose

7

of deciding the manner in which the defendant committed

8

the crime.

9

look to these other documents in order to decide which

10

You're looking to the factual basis or you

crime it was that the offender committed.

11

And the reason that you have to sometimes do

12

that is because there are many State statutes which

13

under a single section number list several different

14

crimes, where "crime" here does not refer to a thing

15

that happened at a particular day at a particular time,

16

but refers to the kind of thing that a statute defines;

17

i.e., a general category.

18

Now, every case that we've written it seems

19

to me says that or is consistent with that.

20

certainly consistent with the idea of the crimes being

21

burglary, arson, explosives, or other dangerous crimes.

22

So the guilty plea is beside the point.

23

say, guilty of 828 376 Section 42-BC, end of the matter.

24
25

And that is

It may just

And we don't know which of those three
things:

House, car, boat, which are there in that
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

section, was the crime committed.

And he's saying

2

that's the end of that.

3

this is a California State statute and it isn't divided

4

into three parts.

5

part is not the equivalent --

And so he says, then, look,

It just has one part.

6

MR. HORWICH:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that one

I think that --- of Federal burglary as

8

defined by Justice Blackmun and the Court in this case,

9

end of matter, QED.

10

MR. HORWICH:

I -- I do think you've

11

accurately described what Petitioner -- the dividing

12

line the Petitioner would advocate is.

13

the Court to look at the experience of the court of

14

appeals with trying to apply that dividing line, and

15

that will reveal to the Court very clearly why it

16

becomes unworkable.

17

appeals -- as the Court's aware there's a division of

18

authority on this -- that have said, well, look, we want

19

to look for statutes that are phrased in the disjunctive

20

or that have these separately numbered subsection

21

headings or something.

22

But I would urge

Because we've got several courts of

Now, setting aside whether that's really

23

principled or not to focus on the text versus the

24

judicial decision, let's accept for the sake of argument

25

that that's the line.

The problem is that then the next
26

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

case that those courts confront, that applying that rule

2

rigidly produces really strange results.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

That's exactly right.

So

therefore, that was my question basically.

5

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

And of course Congress knew

7

that there are hundreds or thousands of State statutes

8

with several different words and they -- you know,

9

different ways of getting at the same thing, and

10

therefore they wrote the next phrase of their Federal

11

statute, which is it's burglary, arson, explosives or

12

otherwise, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a

13

serious potential risk of physical injury.

14

And so if you have a slight variation on the

15

burglary theme, it doesn't fit within generic burglary,

16

but it's pretty hard to imagine it wouldn't otherwise

17

present the same risks, at least if it's only a slight

18

variation.

19

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I -- the parties have

20

not briefed here and I wouldn't want to speculate

21

on what the Court would --

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:
question.

I know and that was my

Why not?
MR. HORWICH:

Well, this case has been

argued as -- because this is a conviction under
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

California burglary, it's been argued under the -- the

2

premise that it should be classified as generic

3

burglary.

4

But let me offer -JUSTICE SCALIA:

Maybe -- maybe they haven't

5

argued it because there's some serious constitutional

6

doubt about whether the statute which makes it a crime

7

to engage in conduct which creates a serious risk of

8

physical injury is constitutional.

9

standard, you go to prison for 30 years if you engage in

10

conduct, quote, "that creates a serious risk of physical

11

injury."

12
13

I'm not about to buy into that one.
MR. HORWICH:

That -- that's -- I understand

Your Honor's view on that, on that subject.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

MR. HORWICH:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

That's such a vague

Mr. Horwich -If I can try to -I'm going to ask you about

an argument you did make.

18

MR. HORWICH:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
As I understand your

20

argument, your argument is not the Ninth Circuit's

21

argument, because you very carefully distinguish what

22

are what you call missing elements cases from this case.

23

MR. HORWICH:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Yes.
So do you reject the Ninth

Circuit's view that the categorical approach should
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

apply even where there is a missing element, as you --

2

as you call it?

3

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I want to be very

4

careful that we're talking about the same thing, when we

5

say "missing element."

6

an example of what I think is a missing element case and

7

one to which we do not think the modified categorical

8

approach can be applied.

9

And so maybe I can give -- give

And -- and the good way to think about the

10

exercise that we think a sentencing court should be

11

engaged in here is to say, imagine there's a set of

12

boxes on one side that correspond to the elements of the

13

generic offense -- excuse me -- of the State offense,

14

and then on the other side a set of boxes that

15

correspond to the elements et of the generic offense.

16

And the exercise is to go through the

17

Shepard materials and figure out what goes into those

18

boxes or what went into those boxes on the State side to

19

establish a basis for the previous conviction.

20

you take whatever was put in those boxes, be it specific

21

or general or whatever it is, and then see if those

22

things give you enough to fill in the elements of the

23

generic offense.

24
25

And then

Now, in a case that we would call a missing
element case, let's take, for example, because we're
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

talking about burglary, let's talk about criminal

2

trespass.

3

as the unlawful entry of a building or structure,

4

period.

5

intent to commit a crime.

6

in the Shepard materials for someone who pleads guilty

7

to criminal trespass, because there's no way you're ever

8

going to get something in one of those boxes about

9

unlawful entry or structure that's going to let you fill

10
11

So criminal trespass let's assume is defined

And there's no provision that you have to have
Now, it doesn't matter what's

in the generic box.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let me give you a -- let me

14

a law enforcement investigation.

15

somebody, maybe the person is pleading, maybe he goes to

16

trial; it doesn't matter.

17

that the defendant violated this statute, interference

18

with a law enforcement investigation, by assaulting a

19

police officer, okay?

20

or is that what you think is going on here, which is

21

just -- it's just an overbroad statute?

22

Let's suppose you

And you're prosecuting

The theory of the case is

Is that a missing elements case

MR. HORWICH:

Well, we would need to know --

23

I guess I would need to know in your hypothetical

24

what -- what we're trying to classify that conviction

25

as, because -30
Alderson Reporting Company

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The conviction is

2

interference with a law enforcement investigation.

3

That's the statute.

4

enforcement investigation can be done in extremely -- it

can be done in an extremely violent way, which would be

an ACCA offense or not.

But interference with a law

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

Well -And it's overbroad.

There

are ACCA offenses in it, but there are also non-ACCA
offenses in it.
MR. HORWICH:

Well, I'm sorry.

I guess

12

my -- my -- my concern is -- is that I would need to

13

know what generic enumerated crime we're trying to fit

14

that into, because although perhaps that could be

15

classified under the residual clause --

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

MR. HORWICH:

Sure.
Well, that might raise a -- I

18

think that raises a different set of questions.

19

to be clear that our argument here at this point is only

20

that the Court should accept this for purposes of

21

dealing with the enumerated -- with enumerated offenses.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I want

Well, why would there be any

23

difference between those two?

Why would you take your

24

argument differently from the residual clause than in

25

the enumerated crimes?
31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I think because the way

2

this Court's residual clause jurisprudence has evolved, it

3

requires the Court to make some assessment of the degree

4

of risk of some set of conduct that's not too much more

5

serious than what the defendant engaged in, but not too

6

much less serious and so I don't know what that

7

reference point is.

8

I think in -- in -- in Your Honor's disagreement with

9

the majority in the Sykes case, I think of, trying to

10

I mean, there's something of that,

figure out what the right frame of reference to draw is.

11

So I think residual clause cases are a very

12

difficult context in which to -- to talk about

13

hypotheticals here, and for that reason, I -- I would --

14

I would -- I think it's more productive to try to assign

15

them to burglary or one of the other generic offenses.

16

If I can give an example --

1

MR. HORWICH:

If the State statute provided

2

that all entries qualified, which is what I understand

3

your hypothetical to be, then I think that probably

4

amounts to a missing elements situation, because -- and

5

I'm taking the Court's test from Shepard here.

6

question is what did the defendant necessarily admit in

7

the plea colloquy.

8

clear -- there may be any number of things that are in

9

the Shepard materials that are noted in the plea

The

And there may be -- I want to be

colloquy, but if they are not offered as the legal basis

11

for the defendant's conviction, then they don't make it

12

into those boxes that I was talking about and they don't

13

make it into being a basis for the generic offense.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's my problem,

15

which is you say that, but how to define a missing

16

element from an alternative element is -- overbroad

if -- if -- if, for example, the California Supreme

3

Court's decision in Gauze had come out the other way and

4

said, yep, it's your own home -- you know, so what.

5

long as you're entering, the statute literally says

6

"entry," there's no -- there's nothing further we need

7

to examine, then I agree this would be -- you could call

8

it a missing element case.

9

I agree that

As

But the problem with Petitioner's position

10

about California law is that that's not California law.

13

But what they said

19

in Gauze is that the entry must invade a possessory

20

right in a building.

21

because that's not having different ways of committing a

22

crime, that's what the word in the statute means.

And that cuts in your favor,

23

MR. HORWICH:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Yes.
Yes.

So now you're ahead.

But the difficulty I think is, as I understand it, that
34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

invading a possessory interest includes -- includes

2

going into a shop with an intent to steal something, a

3

shoplifter.

4

opinion and you can say, ah, that falls right within it,

5

because generic burglary is defined in part there to

6

include generic, an unprivileged remaining in the

7

building.

8
9

Now, you could go back to the Blackmun

And you say, you see, these are the same.
Were it not for two facts.

The first fact

is in Shepard it seems as if the Court says shoplifting

10

is not burglary.

And then you look to the treatise that

11

they cite for that, which is LaFave, and LaFave makes

12

that even more clear.

13

remaining, what we're thinking of is hiding in a bank

That's -- that's what

And Shepard -- Shepard draws an

colloquy had taken place and the prosecutor, instead of

3

saying -- you know, the defendant broke and entered, he

4

had said, the defendant unlawfully entered, right?

5

Completely different result under your theory; isn't

6

that right?

7

I mean, suppose the same plea

MR. HORWICH:

Yes, it is a different result.

8

But let me explain why that is -- that's not actually

9

germane to the dispute that we're having here, because

10

the prosecutor equally could have said, he broke and

11

entered one of the places enumerated in the statute.

12

And that too would have been vague and that wouldn't

13

have allowed the sentencing court to classify it as

14

generic burglary.

15

That -- the possibility that the Shepard

16

records are insufficiently precise or they're too opaque

17

or that they just don't exist because they've been lost

18

is something that can frustrate the application of the

19

modified categorical approach regardless of whether we

20

are talking about cars versus --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think it's -- I think it's

22

a deeper problem than that, because the defendant is

23

standing there and he doesn't care at all whether the

24

prosecutor says unlawfully entered or broke and entered.

25

It doesn't matter a whit to him.

And so -- and so

something is -- is --

MR. HORWICH:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But --- the difference between an

4

enhanced sentence and not an enhanced sentence that is

5

not likely to be thought about, let alone adjudicated.

6

MR. HORWICH:

Well, by the same token, the

7

defendant would not care a whit whether it really was a

8

grocery store or it was a car, because those two would

9

also cause him to be convicted of the same -- of the

10

same burglary offense under California.

11

lead to different results for classifying the prior

12

conviction.

The point -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

expand -- this would expand the problem that you've

15

identified, that the Shepard approach, the existence of

17

would expand that fortuity to a far greater number of

18

cases.

19

MR. HORWICH:

I guess I am not prepared to

20

make a confident prediction about the relative number of

21

cases.

22

that we would be expanding it that way in an effort to

23

assure greater sentencing equity.

24

has --

6

For some reason -- for a reason that it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- I'm not sure

7

that it achieves greater sentencing equity when you have

8

two defendants who have done exactly the same thing in

9

California, and because of the fortuity of what the plea

10

colloquy looked like in one case as opposed to another,

11

when it really didn't matter one way or another in that

12

situation, one person qualifies under ACCA and the other

13

doesn't.

14

MR. HORWICH:

position.

24

some examples where the courts of appeals that might

have preferred to stick to these rules about looking for

Alderson Reporting Company

If I can return to

the word "or" in the statute or looking for separately

2

numbered subsections and then they confront cases like

3

the statutory rape example in our brief, where the State

4

statute of conviction provides that the victim of a

5

statutory rape has to be under the age of 18, but maybe

6

the generic offense says that the victim has to be under

7

the age of 16.

8
9

Now, that element of age isn't phrased in
the disjunctive, but it seems very strange that if the

10

defendant admits to his victim being under -- age 14,

11

that we wouldn't recognize that.

12

Or you have the situation in the Seventh

whether the basis has any relevance to the punishment

3

but put that aside.

4

Here's one thing that strikes me as odd

5

about your position.

6

question -- you said if the California Supreme Court had

7

not decided Gauze, then you would not be up here arguing

8

what you're arguing.

9
10

You said before in response to a

MR. HORWICH:

Well, at least if it was

different, yes.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, if there were -- if

12

there were no unlawful entry that counted under

13

California law --

14

MR. HORWICH:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
-- but -- you know, the fact

16

that there is a strange Gauze case which says that you

17

can't burglarize your own home -- right -- the fact that

18

the Court happens to come across that case and happens

19

to decide -- it seems completely irrelevant as to this

20

matter whether or not the California court once decided

21

that you can't burglarize your own home.

22

have to do with anything in this case?

23

MR. HORWICH:

What does that

Here's -- here's the relevance

24

of it.

It's because at common law, of course, there was

25

a strict breaking requirement, and as this Court
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

recognized in Taylor, and in going back to the LaFave

2

treatise in -- in Taylor, that requirement had over the

3

years and into modern statutes been relaxed to include

4

not only strict breakings, but also entries by fraud,

5

entries by threat and so forth.

6

Gauze -- and the reasoning in Gauze explains

7

that the California legislature's codification of

8

burglary simply does that relaxation a little bit

9

better, by adding essentially one more category of

10

Gauze -- taken with subsequent decisions about

11

shoplifting and such -- explains California just did

12

that one better by adding another category, which is

13

entries that exceed the implied consent to enter public

14

places for lawful purposes.

15

So what you're left with here is, this case

16

exists at the -- the common law core that both

17

California and generic burglary retain, which is an

18

entry by break -- an entry by breaking.

19

that both generic burglary is dispensed with that

20

requirement, in the sense that it allows other things to

21

qualify, and so, too, California has dispensed with that

22

requirement, but it hasn't completely eliminated the

23

relevance entirely of the lawfulness of the entry.

24

There's still a question there.

25

satisfy it --

And it is true

It's simply easier to

45

JUSTICE BREYER:

Let me quickly ask you this

2

then, you say look at Gauze for this reason, it makes

3

clear that in these words of the California statute,

4

there must be an interference with a possessory interest.

5

Now, go back and read the Blackmun opinion, and it

6

says the element of generic burglary includes an

7

unprivileged entry or remaining into a building.

8

say now, between those two forms of words, there is

9

virtually no difference.

10

MR. HORWICH:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

You

Yes.
The one possible difference

is shoplifting.

13

MR. HORWICH:

Exactly.

me.

17

And as to shoplifting, here
This is you, okay?

Not

Shoplifting just is not a factor under

California code section 459.

19

those last words; and therefore, I begin to think maybe

20

it is a factor.

21

I'm then leaning in favor of saying there is a big

22

difference in the California statute in generic

23

burglary.

24
25

Now, you have not added

But if you could tell me, no, there are

2

differently about it, and say, oh, it's close enough.

3

MR. HORWICH:

Well, I can't --

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

You see why I turn back to

5

the empirical question and keep wondering, why is it not

6

possible to get, say, a law professor; they have spare

7

time -- get the sentencing committee, get someone to

8

look and see what are the real behaviors that are

9

convicted under section 459.

10

MR. HORWICH:

I can --

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And then advise defendants

12

who -- who anticipate committing these crimes, so that

13

they will know which crimes carry another 30 years.

14

(Laughter.)

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. HORWICH:

Well --

Well -- Justice Breyer, I

17

don't think I can give you a statistical survey.

18

only thing I can offer, and I offer it with some

19

hesitation, is my conversations with California

20

prosecutors suggest that they are, at least today,

21

generally disinclined to charge shoplifting as burglary,

22

because it's a lot easier, and effectively gets them the

23

same result in those cases, to charge it as larceny.

24

Now --

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that --

anecdotal, at best.

-- but that's -- that's

I don't have anything better.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- to charge it as what?

What's shoplifting?

5

MR. HORWICH:

To charge it as larceny,

6

because very often, it will be the completed shoplifting

7

is very hard to prove they had the intent when they went

8

into the store.

9
10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it -- but it does

come under this section 459.

11

MR. HORWICH:

It does, but it -- in exactly

12

the same way that automobile burglaries come under this

13

statute.

14

burgled, it's broader as to the types -- types of

15

unlawfulness of entry.

The statute is broader as to the place

16

That's not a reason not to recognize that

17

when the defendant, as Petitioner did here, says my

18

crime was breaking and entering -- to recognize it as

19

breaking and entering, which is all we think Shepard

20

asks for.

21

And I want to be clear that you wouldn't go

22

beyond that.

We're not saying that a defendant who's

23

pleading guilty to criminal trespass who says it was

24

breaking and entering and I intended to go steal

25

something in there, you can't then call that burglary,
48
Alderson Reporting Company

because the additional admission to intent is not

2

germane to the conviction for criminal trespass.

3

can't use that and turn that into generic burglary.

4

So you

That answers the hypothetical that was

5

raised about someone who enters a plea bargain to

6

possession of controlled substances instead of

7

distribution.

That -- that answers a great many of the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you tell me what

11

the difference is between entering the garage with

12

permission and taking a wrench and walking out, and

13

entering a store with permission and taking an article

14

Are they both shoplifting?
MR. HORWICH:

15

I -- if in your hypothetical

16

the garage is a -- is not your own garage and you don't

17

have the consent of the garage's owner to -- who knows

18

that you're going to take the wrench, no, they are the

same.

20

Those are the same thing.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They are the same thing.

21

So in answer to Justice Breyer's question, you do admit

22

that under the California definition of burglary,

23

shoplifting could be charged.

24
25

MR. HORWICH:

Shoplifting could be charged,

and someone could plead guilty to shoplifting, and that
49

wouldn't count.

The problem here is that --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

convictions for shoplifting under the statute.

5

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

MR. HORWICH:

There are some.

Absolutely.

You can be

8

convicted of shoplifting.

We don't disagree with that.

9

But what we're saying is that the approach that Taylor

10

and Shepard suggests is one that focuses on what the

11

defendant necessarily admitted in offering the legal

12

basis for his conviction rather than on hypotheticals

about other conduct he might have committed that would

have resulted in the same conviction.
