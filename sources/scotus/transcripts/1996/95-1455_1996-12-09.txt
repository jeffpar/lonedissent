CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 94-1455, Janet Reno v. Bossier Parish School

5

Board, and George Price v. Bossier Parish School Board.

6

How do you pronounce the name of this parish, do

7

you know, Mr. Patrick?

8

MR. PATRICK:

9
10

It -- we -- it is usually referred

to and has been in the litigation as Bossier Parish, but
in Louisiana it's Bossier.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

12

MR. PATRICK:

Bossier, okay.

And if you say Bossier -- if you

13

say Bossier in the course of this I'll probably be

14

confused, so if you say Bossier it would be helpful.

15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

French it would be Bossier rather than Bossier.

17

MR. PATRICK:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

19

You would think in

Bossier, oui.
Very well,

Mr. Patrick --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEVAL L. PATRICK

2

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLANT

3

5

MR. PATRICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The Bossier Parish School Board adopted the

6

redistricting plan at issue in this case with a

7

discriminatory purpose, plain and simple, and in finding

8

otherwise, the district court ignored evidence that this

9

Court has required fact-finders to consider since its

10

decision in the Arlington Heights case, evidence of racial

11

block voting and of the recent history of discrimination

12

in voting and otherwise in Bossier Parish, evidence that

13

was undisputed, indeed was stipulated below.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Patrick, when you say the

15

district court ignored the evidence, you don't mean that

16

it excluded it as a matter of admission of evidence, but

17

just that it refused to take it into consideration in

18

making its conclusion?

19

MR. PATRICK:

Frankly, Mr. Chief Justice, it's

20

very hard to say.

There was not an evidentiary ruling in

21

the classic sense, in -- because all of the evidence came

22

into the record by way of stipulation without objection by

23

the parties, but what is plain is that the court did not

24

even mention the Arlington Heights case or the Arlington

25

Heights standards, and in one point in the decision went

so far as to say that it would not expressly consider the

2

evidence of the history of discrimination in the school

3

board, and when you -- excuse me, Mr. --

4

QUESTION:

If it came in by stipulation, or it's

5

not an evidentiary point, really, it's an argument that

6

the court's refusal to take it into consideration makes

7

its findings clearly erroneous or wrong as a matter of

8

law, I -MR. PATRICK:

9

Well, as a matter of law in the

10

first instance, Your Honor, because under Arlington

11

Heights, which requires that in making a determination of

12

purposeful discrimination that the court take into account

13

the totality of the circumstances, and where Rogers v.

14

Lodge has said that this specific kind of evidence is

15

important to a determination of purposeful discrimination,

16

we argue in the first instance that there was a violation

17

of -- that there is a legal error and, indeed, when you

18

take --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

How do we know that they didn't take

that into account?
MR. PATRICK:

Because they did not, in the first

22

instance, even cite the Arlington Heights precedent.

23

did not indicate what standard was being used in the -- if

24

you look at the analysis

evidence.

What particular evidence do you maintain they

MR. PATRICK:

4

QUESTION:

5

It's --

-- and how do you know that they

didn't take account of it?.
MR. PATRICK:

6

There are two kinds of evidence

7

that bends to the question, Your Honor, about how we know

8

they didn't take account of it.

First of all, the

9

evidence of racial bloc voting.

This is a community where

10

the parties have stipulated that 80 percent of the voters

11

in the parish will not vote for a candidate of a race

12

different than them.

13

14

QUESTION:

That is stipulated at 122a of the

But didn't the -- I mean,

the

15

response that's made by the appellee here is that the

16

court -- that all that that would prove is that therefore,

17

since there was bloc voting,

18

voters if there were majority black districting, but

19

didn't the court assume that to be true?

20

MR. PATRICK:

21

QUESTION:

22

25

No, Your Honor.

I don't think --

It didn't assume that -- I thought

it

24

it would advantage the black

MR. PATRICK:

I -- excuse me.

Did you -- I'm

sorry.
QUESTION:

Yes.

I thought that the court's

1

discussion just takes as a given that it would be to the

2

benefit of the blacks if they had a majority-minority

3

district.

4

MR. PATRICK:

I'm not sure that we can fairly

5

assume that from the district court's opinion.

What the

6

district court said is that evidence of this kind is

7

relevant to section 2, there's no question about that.

8

But we contend, and Arlington Heights supports

9

us, that it is independently relevant to the question of

10

purposeful discrimination.

There is no evidence, in fact,

11

on this record which is relevant to the one question, the

12

section 2 question, but not relevant to the purpose

13

determination in the case and, indeed, the court expressly

14

refused in its opinion at 34a, footnote 18, the evidence

15

that the board itself was in violation of the Federal

16

desegregation order with respect to the schools, so that

17

when you take into account the evidence that was excluded

18

and the -- both the racial bloc voting and the history of

19

discrimination, all of which is stipulated and uncontested

20

below, and you think -- and you consider that in light of

21

the other evidence that was considered, that the plan --

22

QUESTION:

Well, the evidence wasn't so much

23

excluded as not considered --

MR. PATRICK:

QUESTION:

I think that's --

QUESTION:

Evidentiary rule, yes.

5

MR. PATRICK:

Of a rule of evidence -- that's

6

right, and because all of the stipulations came into the

7

record without objection on relevance or any other

8

grounds, I think Your Honor is right.

10

QUESTION:

Has this Court applied Arlington

Heights in a section 5 determination, do you know?

11

MR. PATRICK:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

What this Court has done --

I thought we had not, but what do you

rely on for that?
MR. PATRICK:

I rely on Rogers v. Lodge, which

15

is a -- which, as you know, is a case where the court has

16

said that the Arlington Heights factors are probative of

17

the judgment about whether there's purposeful

18

discrimination under the Voting Rights Act.

19

I think what is key in your analysis and

20

consideration of this case is that you bear in mind all of

21

the facts, as Arlington Heights requires, all of the facts

22

and circumstances known to the board at the time, and ask

23

yourself, does it add up?

24
25

This is a plan, you understand, that is against
the school board's own interests, both its districting and

typically concerned about distributing the schools among

3

the school districts, and yet adopted a plan that has some

4

school districts with no schools in it at all.

stipulated at 112a and 73a of the record.
QUESTION:

This is a school board that is

That is

It --

Mr. Patrick, would you clarify for me

7

what you think the legal standard is before we go much

further into the argument?

10

That is, we know that the effect, what they call
the effect problem of section 5 is about retrogression.

QUESTION:

Yes.

What does the purpose -- what does it

mean?

have the purpose of denying the right to vote on account

15

of race?

16

What does the statute mean when it says, shall not

MR. PATRICK:

We take that to mean that the

17

factors -- that the school board has to show a

18

nondiscriminatory purpose within the meaning of Arlington

19

Heights by taking into account the totality of the

20

circumstances, looking at the actions and inactions in

21

this case of the school board, in reaching the conclusion

22

they did, all the facts and circumstances known to the

23

board at the time.

MR. PATRICK:

That's right.

I was saying that the -- about the plan that

they did adopt that this is a plan which it is conceded

stipulated facts.
QUESTION:

13

These are all

Mr. Patrick, would it have been open

14

or was it open at the district court to accept all of this

15

and say, look, all of this evidence does point in the

16

direction of intent to discriminate, but there's a piece

17

of counterevidence here and that is, the moment at which

18

the board seemed to turn around and suddenly embrace the

19

police district plan, which it did not originally want,

20

was the moment at which it became apparent that there was

21

going to be a fight about this.

22

following the NAACP's submission, I think, of a couple of

23

plans.

24
25

It was the moment

And it is findable on this record that what the
board wanted to do was to avoid 7 years of litigation, and

If that was the court's reasoning process, would

clearly erroneous?

MR. PATRICK:

It was clearly erroneous.

It's

not entirely clear that that was the court's -QUESTION:

I realize that.

MR. PATRICK:

-- the court's reasoning.

What

11

the court said was that it might be a legitimate reason to

12

seek easy preclearance.

13

implies is that the reason was that they wanted to avoid a

14

controversy with the black citizens, but --

16

QUESTION:

What Your Honor's question

Well, they wanted to avoid

litigation, and they could see it coming.

17

MR. PATRICK:

If that's what it was.

18

I do think Your Honor is right that the process

19

and the sequence of events leading up to the decision is

20

extremely telling and, indeed, Arlington Heights requires

21

that that be considered as well.

22

23
24
25

This was a process that was undertaken more than
3 years before they needed the plan.
QUESTION:

So if we didn't have the process and

the sequence, if we just had a lazy school board that

said, oh, the police jury got this plan, and it was

2

precleared, so we'll take it with all its faults, if it

3

hadn't been that, would this -- would it have been okay?

4
5
6

MR. PATRICK:

I think it would be a very

different case.
Clearly, the -- that's not the case we have

7

here, because we have a board that expected to draw a plan

8

different from the police jury plan at the outset.

9

is stipulated, too, as well in the record and, indeed, we

That

10

have a board that had a different plan from the police

11

jury for a decade or more before they were faced with the

12

redistricting considerations.

13

This is a board that hired a cartographer with

14

the expectation he would spend 200 -- 250 hours drawing a

15

plan different from the police jury and went about that at

16

a leisurely pace for over a year.

17

Everything changed when the black citizens came

MR. PATRICK:

Well, we're certainly not

contending that you can build a section 5 out of only --

way to understand the district court's opinion by saying

What is apparent, however, is that the district

that this is a school board that came before the United

MR. BORKOWSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

19

I'd like to start with the question Justice

20

Scalia just asked about footnote 18, because that shows

21

very clearly, I think, what has been going on in Bossier

22

Parish.

23

The evidence that the court didn't look at that

24

dealt with the board's exclusion, admitted exclusion of

25

blacks from educational policy issues.

The court had

ordered that a committee be established to allow blacks to

2

have an opportunity for input into school board issues.

3

This is the kind of nonresponsiveness, the kind of

4

exclusion that is exactly what happened in the

5

redistricting process.

6

QUESTION:

Well, if we're -- if you're going to

7

get into the sort of detail that you say Arlington Heights

8

requires us to get into, I would think that it would be

9

important to know whether the school board's failure to

10

maintain a biracial committee was the result of hostility

11

to the idea, neglect, maybe unable to have the funds,

12

maybe just got lost in the shuffle.

13

In other words, just saying it failed to

14

maintain a biracial committee, if we're going to get into

15

the sort of textual detail that Arlington Heights says,

16

you have to know more about it than that.

17

MR. BORKOWSKI:

That's absolutely right, and the

18

facts on this record are that the board admitted in the

19

direct testimonies of Mr. Musgrove and Mr. Myrick, the two

20

board members who testified, that when this committee

21

started getting into educational policy issues, they

22

disbanded, because they did not want this committee having

23

a role in it.

The consent decree

and in Pleasant Grove even the dissenters, who did not

2

find discriminatory purpose, cited Arlington Heights as

3

the proper standard to apply, and decisions that this

Court has affirmed -- Busbee v. Smith and Port Arthur --

constitutional standard, and -- so I'm just talking at

this point about the purpose argument.
All of these factors under Arlington Heights are

7

If you look at the evidence the majority

analyzes, it only analyzes two types of evidence, and

doesn't look at all sorts of evidence.

You asked what was excluded.

The fact that the

board's plan fractures black neighborhoods, the same

evidence in Arlington Heights shows discriminatory

purpose, it could not have reached the conclusion that it

The point here is that if the court actually

As Judge Kessler said in dissent, this is -- the

8

evidence is far from being equally convincing on either

9

side.

10

If you look at all of the stipulated and unrebutted

evidence, this is not a close case.
The problem here with the majority's approach,

11
12

and the problem in -- if this Court would affirm the

13

majority's decision, is that it would effectively

14

eviscerate the purpose prong of section 5.

15

It would mean that the only kind of

16

discriminatory purpose that would be reachable under

section 5 would be publicly admitted or covertly tape

recorded discriminatory purpose, because every other

category of evidence that this Court has said in Arlington

purpose.

MR. BORKOWSKI:

Then I would say that you would

have to remand with instructions to apply Arlington

in the voting context, in section 5 cases, in school

14

cases, in all cases where intent is an issue, to look at

15

that evidence in all of those categories, keeping in mind

16

that the burden of proof is on the school board here.

17

There was also evidence that the court

18

considered that the court offered its own explanations

19

for, which we cite in our briefs as another legal error.

20

The only evidence, contemporaneous, direct evidence of the

MR. CARVIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

Let me begin by focusing on the standard that

10

the district court actually did apply in assessing the

11

evidence.

12

Appellants would have this Court believe that

13

the district court had in front of it a body of evidence

14

that it considered probative to the question of purpose,

15

and it sifted through that evidence and threw out all the

16

evidence that it also thought was relevant to section 2,

17

but of course the district court did not say that, and did

18

not do that.

QUESTION:

Okay.

I will agree that some of the

2

court's statement about what it was doing with evidence

3

perhaps were ambiguous and lent themselves to your

4

interpretation, but at the bottom of the page the court

5

quotes from --

6

QUESTION:

Twenty-three a?

7

QUESTION:

Yes, page 23a.

The court quotes from

8

a panel opinion of a different panel but at the same

9

court, and this is what it says:

10

As the panel noted, the court in Miller

11

reaffirmed that the purpose prong of section 5 must be

12

analyzed within the context of section 5's purpose, which

13

has always been to ensure that no voting procedure changes

14

would be made that would lead to a retrogression in the

15

position of racial minorities.

16

Now, it seems to me that the court is there

17

making it clear that the only purpose evidence it would

18

consider was evidence of purpose to effect a

19

retrogression, as opposed to a broader purpose to

20

discriminate.

Isn't that fairly clear?

21

MR. CARVIN:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. CARVIN:

No, it's not, Your Honor.
Then explain that.
First of all, the case he is citing

from did not -- was making the point that in analyzing

25

purpose you must look at the limited purpose of section 5

and not get into these additional section 2 issues that

2

the Justice Department had urged upon the court in Texas

3

and was also urging upon the court here.

4

But more directly to answer your question, of

5

course, it was stipulated in this case that there was no

6

retrogressive effect of the plan, so under your

7

understanding of the district court opinion, the district

8

court would have only been looking at, at did they have a

9

purpose to effect a retrogression?

This would have been a

10

very short opinion indeed if that had been its analysis.

11

It did not look at the purpose of the new plan

of the new plan as compared to the maximization

Pleasant Grove has already decided that issue and, indeed,

since it was stipulated that it didn't even have the

and say, be clear, take it into account and do it?
MR. CARVIN:

2

There is no dispute as to what the

district court did.

Appellants have now changed their

4

opinion as to the legal standard applying.
Let me proceed in two steps.

5

The district

6

court, in analyzing whether or not two nonretrogressive

7

plans reflect discriminatory purposes, compares the

8

maximizing alternative to the plan adopted and again asks,

9

do we have a legitimate, nondiscriminatory purpose?

10

is an impact here.

11

one does not.

There

One's got black majority districts,

Now, what the appellants are asking the district

12

13

court to do is, after they've figured out whether that

14

impact is motivated by a discriminating purpose, go ahead

15

and analyze racial bloc voting.

16

Well, what would that show you?

17

voting is relevant to is whether the black majority

18

districts have an impact.

If you have no racial bloc voting, if you have

that appellants insist they -- insist it do, and agreed

2

with them entirely, it would have returned to precisely

3

the place it started, which is, yes, the NAACP plan, the

4

failure to adopt it has an impact, but the relevant

5

question under section 5 is whether that was motivated by

6

a discriminatory purpose.

7

You see, all of the confusion comes here is

8

because they keep quoting cases where plaintiffs, minority

9

plaintiffs have the burden and, of course, in section 5

10
11

the burden is reversed.
So yes, in Rogers v. Lodge and Gingles and all

12

of those cases, plaintiffs must prove racial bloc voting.

13

They must prove that you can create a compact black

14

MR. CARVIN:

It would be relevant but

superfluous.

Therefore, what section 5 courts should do

is not exclude it as a matter of law, but pay attention to

it only if it furthers the inquiry.
What appellants are asking this Court to do is

6

7

to rule as a matter of law that they must always consider

racial bloc voting, and my question again is, how does

9

that further the analysis?
You have just gone through a comparison of a

plan that you assume is better for black voters compared

12

to one that you have assumed is not good for black voters,

Now, you could spend 20 or so pages discussing

the extraordinarily voluminous evidence showing that,

indeed, plans with black majority districts are better for

articulated in Arlington Heights.

agree.

20

citing cases where minority plaintiffs have the burden

21

makes it confusing when you're dealing with a section 5

it cited this Court's voting rights cases of City of

That is what the appellants are

It was done by the police jury and could have

been done, and indeed the record indicates that the school

board could have drawn a plan with two majority-minority

districts in it that ended up with fewer precincts in it

than the police jury plan.
The other point I wanted to make is that the

Court needs to understand that this is not a choice.

This

10

case is not about a choice between the plan they adopted

11

and the NAACP alternative.

That is a -- that's a ruse.

It's very important to understand that this is

12

13

about the school board's unwillingness to consider any

alternative at all to the plan that they knew at the time

was dilutive, and which they admit on the record at the

time they knew they could have drawn one with two

18

It is not maximizing for the Department of

Justice to question a jurisdiction that draws a plan which

hardly serves its own interests, that pits incumbents
