ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN M. LENCHEK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. LENCHEK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

please the Court:
This case presents the question:

Does the

12

provision of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that

13

prohibits retaliation against, quote, employees, unquote,

14

for filing charges of discrimination or otherwise availing

15

themselves of their rights under Title VII -- namely

16

Section 704(a) -- does that section cover former

17

employees, employees such as Petitioner, Charles Robinson,

18

who were discharged prior to the alleged retaliation?

19

In this case, after Charles Robinson was

20

terminated by Shell Oil, he filed a charge of

21

discrimination against Shell under Title VII, and

22

subsequently, Shell gave him a negative job reference.

23

then brought the present action, alleging that that

24

negative reference was made in retaliation for his earlier

25

charge of discrimination.

He

1

The Fourth Circuit held that Charles Robinson

2

was not even entitled to have the court determine whether

3

that reference was retaliatory, because he was not

4

employed by Shell at the time of the reference.

5

had given him that reference the day before he was

6

terminated, everyone agrees, he would have had that right

7

to a judicial determination.

8

9

QUESTION:

If Shell

Well, if you're right, it's -- it's a

rather sure way to make -- make sure you don't get a bad

10

reference; you just file a complaint with the EEOC a

11

couple of days after -- or a couple of days before you're

12

fired, even though the firing is completely justified.

13
14
15

MR. LENCHEK:

Well, that is not, in fact, what

actually happens.
QUESTION:

No, it may not be what in fact

16

happened in your case, but it certainly might happen in a

17

number of other cases if we sustain your position.

18

QUESTION:

Or even if you're not going to be

19

fired, even if you just intend to quit, it would be very

20

wise, before you quit, to file an EEOC complaint.

21

then, if -- if the employer gives you a bad reference in

22

-- in your later job, he takes the risk of being sued for

23

that, on the basis of retaliation.

24
25

MR. LENCHEK:

Because

He's buying a lawsuit.

There are, in fact, disincentives

to frivolous charges built into Title VII, which hopefully

1

would take care of that problem.

2

QUESTION:

Well, what are -- what are they?

3

MR. LENCHEK:

A principal brings a frivolous

4

lawsuit under Title VII may be hit with attorney's fees

5

and costs.
QUESTION:

6

What about, are there any

7

disincentives to filing a frivolous complaint with the

8

EEOC?

Any similar disincentives?
MR. LENCHEK:

9

There -- there are -- no, the EEOC

10

can't apply any disincentives like that.

11

But we believe that the language -QUESTION:

12

That's true.

What other remedies are available to

13

someone who, after he's -- he's been terminated, thinks

14

that a reference was erroneously made and given by the

15

former employer?

16

would be open for redress?

17
18

Is there any other action at law that

MR. LENCHEK:

There are possible actions under

State law.

19

QUESTION:

Right.

20

MR. LENCHEK:

But it is well established that

21

Title VII is intended to give parallel remedies to any

22

other remedies that may be available.

23

We believe that the language of Title VII, and

24

the purpose of Section 704(a), indicate that Congress

25

intended former employer -- employees -- to be covered by

1

the retaliatory section.

2

shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer

3

to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants

4

for employment because he has opposed the charge or

5

because he has opposed an unlawful practice or because he

6

has made a charge or participated in an EEOC proceeding as

7

a possible witness.
I emphasize that Section 704(a) protects an

8

9

Section 704(a) provides that it

employee who has made a charge, because the substantive

10

provision of Title VII, Section 703(a), cited in full and

11

verbatim in the Respondent's brief at page 14, makes it an

12

unlawful employment practice to discharge any individual

13

because of his race, and so on.

14
15

QUESTION:

And that -- that complaint was made

here?

16
17

MR. LENCHEK:

QUESTION:

19

MR. LENCHEK:

21

That's exactly what happened in

this case.

18

20

An individual --

And -- and the plaintiff lost?
Right.

That's right.

That's

right.
Now, an employee who is discharged will

22

necessarily file his charge of discrimination after he

23

ceases working for that employer.

24

Section 704(a)

25

QUESTION:

So when Congress wrote

Well, he'll file his charge if -- if
6

1

he claims the discharge is discriminatory?

2

MR. LENCHEK:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

He could -- the employee could remain

4

employed and file a complaint that a failure to promote

5

was discriminatory, couldn't he?

6

MR. LENCHEK:

That's right.

That's right.

But

7

he would remain an employee, and if he were retaliated

8

against because of that charge, he would ordinarily still

9

be an employee and clearly be covered by the Act.
The point I want to make is that when Congress

10
11

wrote this statute, it contemplated that people would file

12

charges alleging that they were discriminatorily

13

discharged --

14

QUESTION:

It -- it's the time of the

15

discrimination that -- that -- that's relevant for

16

704(a) --

17

MR. LENCHEK:

18

QUESTION:

19

-- and the person who is fired

because he filed a complaint --

20

MR. LENCHEK:

21

QUESTION:

22

Exact --

-- was an employee at the time he was

fired.

23

MR. LENCHEK:

24

QUESTION:

25

Exactly.

Exactly.

So he would be -- he would be well

covered, even if "employee" means only current employee?

MR. LENCHEK:

1

He would be covered by 7 --

2

703(a).

The issue in this case is, if he's no longer an

3

employee at the time of the retaliation, is he covered be

4

the statute?

5

QUESTION:

Well --

6

QUESTION:

If he's fired as a means of retal --

7

if he's either not promoted or fired --

8

MR. LENCHEK:

9

QUESTION:

Of course, if he's --

-- as a means of retaliation --

10

MR. LENCHEK:

11

QUESTION:

Of course, that --

-- he would be covered under 704(a),

12

even if 704(a) is just limited to current employees,

13

right?

14

MR. LENCHEK:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. LENCHEK:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LENCHEK:

That's right.

Okay.
That's right.

So -But the point I want to make is

19

that Congress knew that people would be subject to

20

retaliation under 704(a) when they were no longer

21

employees, because there would be people who file charges

22

alleging that they were discharged because of race and so

23

on, and those people would necessarily be no longer

24

employees at the time they might be retaliated against.

25

So Congress must have contemplated that people who would

1

be firing -- fired, would be filing charges and then might

2

be retaliated against when they were no longer employees.

3

QUESTION:

Well, do we have to look at the

4

definition in the applicable section here of the word

5

"employee"?

Is that how we should proceed?

MR. LENCHEK:

6

Un -- unfortunately, that

7

definition has -- this Court has said that definition

8

doesn't help us much -QUESTION:

9

Well, the definition says the term

10

"employee" means an individual employed by an employer.

11

And that is ambiguous in your view?

12

MR. LENCHEK:

13

QUESTION:

14

Well, this Court --

It could include former employees, a

person employed?

15

MR. LENCHEK:

That is precisely what we're

16

saying.

17

definition is a circular definition, which doesn't help

18

much in deciding who is an employee.

19
20

Because, as the Court has said in Darden, that

QUESTION:

-- a purpose that's not relevant in

this --

21

MR. LENCHEK:

22

QUESTION:

23

And as --

That's right.

-- a traditional common-law type

employee versus an independent contractor.

24

MR. LENCHEK:

25

QUESTION:

That --

So it's not -- it's not circular for
9

1

that purpose, but it just doesn't speak to what's at issue

2

here?
MR. LENCHEK:

3

That's right.

But as -- as Your

4

Honor pointed out in the earlier argument, a word in a

5

statute may have different meanings in different --

6

different parts of the statute, and one must look at the

7

purpose of the statute to decide what that particular

8

meaning is in a given place in the statute.
QUESTION:

9

Well, I understand it to be your

10

position that the -- circular though the -- the definition

11

may be, it is helpful to you in the sense that it is as

12

consistent with the reading, who was employed by an

13

employer, as with the reading, who is employed by an

14

employer.

15

the word "employed" is the modifier.

So -- so you're still in the game, even though

16

MR. LENCHEK:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. LENCHEK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LENCHEK:

That's right.

That's your argument?
That is exactly right.

Yeah.
And -- and in order to decide

21

which of the multiple meanings the word "employee" has in

22

this statute, one must look to the purpose of the statute.

23

And the purpose of the statute, obviously, is to protect

24

those people who get discharged and then file charges of

25

discrimination, and may be subject to retaliation.

And

1

Congress clearly contemplated that those people would be

2

making charges, would be subject to retaliation, and wrote

3

the retaliation provision, using the simple --

4

QUESTION:

Why should Congress contemplate that?

5

I would -- if I were a congressman, I would have had a

6

hard time figuring out how an employer could retaliate

7

against somebody who is no longer an employee.

8

retaliate by refusing to rehire the guy, perhaps.

9

that case, he's covered, because he would be an applicant

He could
But, in

10

for employment.

But the notion that he could retaliate

11

once -- once the employ -- employment relationship is

12

terminated -- I mean, I guess he could -- he could send

13

somebody over to -- to mug him or something like that, but

14
QUESTION:

15
16

How about cutting off his pension

benefits?

17

MR. LENCHEK:

18

QUESTION:

Well, that -- surely that would be

19

unlawful, wouldn't it?

20

MR. LENCHEK:

21
22

That's right.

No question about it; this Court

has said so.
QUESTION:

Well, would -- would you need this

23

Act to -- to prevent his -- that's like sending somebody

24

over to mug him.

25

MR. LENCHEK:

Yes, one does need this Act.

3

QUESTION:

You don't have to worry about that?

You have laws against it.
MR. LENCHEK:

Yes, one does need this Act.

In

4

Arizona Governing Committee, which was cited in Hishon,

5

which we cite in our case, this Court said that cutting

6

off pension benefits or discriminating with regard to

7

pension benefits on the basis of sex was a violation of

8

the substantive provision of Title VII.

9

The reason one needs this Act is because, if an

10

employer chose to cut off pension benefits as a

11

retaliatory measure, and then were -- was -- was charged

12

under the substantive provision of Title VII -- the claim

13

would be you cut off my pension benefits because I'm black

14

-- the employer then -- if this Court upholds the Fourth

15

Circuit -- could come in and use the fact that it was

16

motivated by retaliation as an affirmative defense to the

17

charge that it was motivated by sex or race.

18

If this Court upholds the Fourth Circuit, an

19

employer will have carte blanche to retaliate against

20

discharged employees.

21

QUESTION:

As a matter of fact -I'm not sure -- I'm not sure, in the

22

context of a pension or a bonus, that there is not a

23

sufficient ongoing relation, so that the discrimination

24

that you are hypothesizing would be against an employee,

25

even though the employee has been terminated.

(800) FOR DEPO

I think

1

there still are certain subsisting relations between the

2

-- the individual and the employer, one of which is

3

entitlements to pension, which would mean that he's an

4

employee for that purpose.

5

MR. LENCHEK:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, that's

6

right.

That would take care of -- of that one particular

7

class.

But there's a broader class that would not be

8

covered if this Court upheld the Fourth Circuit.

9

is all those people who have no remaining relationship

10

with that employer.

Circuit --

And if the Court upholds the Fourth

I -- I was -- I was just directing my

13

--my comments to the pension and bonus example.

14

I agree with your next point that you --

15

And that

MR. LENCHEK:

Yes.

But I --

But consider -- consider

16

what Shell Oil or any employer could do if this Court

17

upholds the Fourth Circuit.

18

hands down its decision, Shell Oil could announce a policy

that any terminated employee who then later files a charge

20

of discrimination against the company will be subject to

retaliation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15
16

MR. WOLFSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

17

Under the Court of Appeals reading of Section

18

704(a), any employee who was discharged and who went to

19

the EEOC with a complaint of discrimination would lack

20

protection against his former employer for -- for --

21

against retaliation by his former employer.

22

I want to focus for a minute on why that seems

23

just to be implausible that Congress would have carved out

24

such a large category of employees from the reach of

25

Section 704, especially since discharged employees are

1

probably among the -- the category of employees that are

2

really --

3

QUESTION:

If we are talking about what Congress

4

might have intended, do you think Congress really intended

5

that an action could be brought against an employer who

6

makes a reference for a person after -- after he's been

7

the case is, even assuming a former employee may be an

MR. BUTLER:

That's -- that's certainly true.

And I think the point there is that it demonstrates that

704 is a narrowly constructed statute.

QUESTION:

It is not even --

Mr. Butler, would it cover a case

where an applicant -- an employee -- current employee --

doesn't get the promotion and is -- stays on the payroll,

continues to work, but is looking for another job; in the

10

course of that job search, gets a reference which that

employee says is retaliatory?

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So, now, let me go back to the

19

question that I was putting before to Mr. Wolfson.

20

Doesn't that scenario mean that the employer, once he

21

doesn't give the promotion to this person, should say, And

22

you're out, because if the employer keeps the person on

your reading, is get rid of the person?
MR. BUTLER:
QUESTION:

Yeah.
Then we insulate ourself, at least

from the retaliation charge?
MR. BUTLER:

To the extent an employer is

13

motivated by a desire to give negative references, I'd

14

agree with that.

15

But that's a little --

QUESTION:

Well, he doesn't have to fire him.

He could just --he could just tell him, I'll -- I'll

That -- that would handle the

You don't have to fire him; just

that each of the speakers in this morning's argument said

that, at least to be an employee under that section of the

9

statute, you had to have an ongoing employment

10

And that bright line is whether or not
I listened with

And what interested me was not whether or not the

And I couldn't agree more.

You cannot have an ongoing employment

13

employment relationship, I don't see how you can be

14

covered by the statute.

Mr. Butler, assuming -- and I think

we would all recognize that your interpretation is a

reasonable one.

9

If one also thinks that the EEOC's

I think that the reason for that

10

is because the EEOC position, the petitioner's position,

is not supported by the statutory language.

1

I think if you -- if you try to

analyze the language into whether it's active or passive

voice, and whether it's past or present tense, you

4

completely lose sight of what any ordinary individual

would read when they read 704 -- that an employer cannot

do certain things to his employees.

QUESTION:

Yes.

But if you go back to the -- if

8

you go back to the pension example, there are some pension

based on length of service and so forth.

particular plaintiff no -- no -- no more benefit than

12

would the normal libel law?

13

MR. BUTLER:

Exactly.

It would -- it would be

14

pretty much the same as any defamation action in any

State.

How often do you give references in

Quite often.

They do give references.

Sir?

22

Mr. Butler -- Mr. Butler, may I ask

you one question?

20

I wanted to point out that 704 --

In discharge cases?
Where it's discharge for cause?

Yes.

MR. BUTLER:

QUESTION:

Yeah.
Even at that, we will -And your solution for your case is --

is a solution that will also preclude a claim in a case in

which someone says -- the employer says, Look, you file a

charge against me, and I will see to it that you will

MR. BUTLER:

9

QUESTION:

Your Honor -So it's not -- it's -- well, what I'm

10

getting at is that it is not just the frivolous case, the

11

frivolous charge in your case, the reference, but it is

12

also an instance in which an employer says you will

13

absolutely never work in this business again?

14

precludes that?

MR. BUTLER:

It

retaliation by someone, after they've dis -- been

discharged, whether it's frivolous or whether it's

serious.

QUESTION:

MR. BUTLER:

21

QUESTION:

22

Okay.
You're -- you're quite correct.
And you could solve your problem by

not giving references in discharge cases?

MR. BUTLER:

That's correct.

That -- I know that was in

your brief, but that seemed to me very strange.

claim against the next person who won't hire that person

don't you have a much stronger case against the one who

gave the reference, allegedly false, than the one who

MR. BUTLER:

No, I don't, because that's not

QUESTION:

The statute says that the person

course, but the statute doesn't use the word

"retaliation"?

That's right.

2

with his previous employer -- this guy is a troublemaker

3

-- it wouldn't really be retaliation, but it would violate

4

this provision, because it specifically refers to

5

applicants for employment, right?
MR. BUTLER:

6

7

Yes.

We may be getting ourselves

in trouble by using the shorthand term of "retaliation."

QUESTION:

9

MR. BUTLER:
QUESTION:

10

Retaliation.
That's right.
Yeah, but as -- as a practical

11

matter, it seems to me the -- the situation, because it is

12

not what's going to happen except among very, very stupid

3

employers, because the -- the retaliatory letter is -- is

4

not going to say, Don't hire this guy because he filed a

complaint.

because he does lousy work.

The letter is going to say, Don't hire him

MR. BUTLER:

That's right.

QUESTION:

2

Yeah, but I thought your argument --

3

I thought your argument was that the person who is subject

4

to this discrimination will have a cause of action under

5

the statute against the prospective employer who relies

6

upon the retaliatory letter.

7

MR. BUTLER:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well -And unless the retaliatory letter is

expressly based upon filing the EEOC complaint, that won't
be true.
MR. BUTLER:

11

That's right.

Or if he could

12

somehow prove that whatever statements were made in the

13

letter were actually fabricated because of that, because

14

of the charge, and he knew about it, the prospective

employer knew -- knew about it --

MR. BUTLER:

Right.

-- then you could make a case on

that, yes.
QUESTION:

Yeah, that's a tough, uphill fight.

But that's not going to be the characteristic case -MR. BUTLER:

I -- I would think not.

But -- you

22

know, it wasn't extensively discussed in any of the

23

briefs, but I was struck by an analysis that Chief Justice

24

Toflatt, in the 11th Circuit, wrote in 1990, where he

25

analyzed this whole claim under Court v. Ash, and whether

there would be an implied cause of action under that test.

2

And he said there's no conclusion other than it cannot.
Because there is a remedy contained within the

And what you're doing is trying to broaden that
