CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

first this morning in Number 96-542, Walter McMillian v.

5

Monroe County, Alabama.

Mr. Stevenson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. STEVENSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are before the Court on the question of

12

whether an Alabama county is liable for the

13

unconstitutional actions of its sheriff where the county's

14

voters select and elect the sheriff, where the county's

15

Treasury funds the conduct of the sheriff, and where the

16

sheriff's jurisdictional authority is limited to the

17

status of the county as one of Alabama's 67 counties.

18

At the outset, I think in thinking about this

19

issue it's important to acknowledge that no one disputes

20

that the sheriff is a final policymaking -- a final

21

policymaker in the area of law enforcement.

22

The Eleventh Circuit found that the sheriff --

23

Alabama law gives the sheriff in Alabama final

24

policymaking authority in the area of law enforcement.

25

Respondent concedes that the sheriff has final

1

policymaking authority in this area.

2

The issue arises --

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, Mr. Stevenson, I assume that

the plaintiff here also sued the sheriff.

5

MR. STEVENSON:

6

QUESTION:

7
8

9
10
11

That's correct.

And if there's a judgment against the

sheriff, who pays it in Alabama?
MR. STEVENSON:

The evidence in this case is

that it will be paid by the county.

That is, that the

county has taken out an insurance policy -QUESTION:

So what difference does it make

12

whether you can join the county?

13

judgment against the sheriff anyway, and it's going to be

14

paid, what do you care?

15

MR. STEVENSON:

If you're going to get a

Well, the policy is capped, Your

16

Honor, and because we don't know yet whether the county

17

has the option of disclaiming the conduct in question,

18

then it does make a difference.

19

QUESTION:

Well, presumably if you sue the

20

sheriff and get a judgment, somehow that money is going to

21

be produced to pay the judgment.

22

MR. STEVENSON:

That's not required under

23

Alabama law.

24

there is evidence -- and again, the evidence is not

25

developed -- that the county has elected to take out a

That is, what happened in this case is that

1

policy which may cover the sheriff's conduct here, and

2

while we think that's relevant in deciding the county's

3

interest in this matter,

4

the petitioner will have access to county funds, and it's

5

certainly not required under Alabama law.
QUESTION:

6
7

You suggest perhaps in other Alabama

counties there might not be an insurance policy -MR. STEVENSON:

8
9

it's not dispositive of whether

That's correct, Justice --

Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, that there may not be.
QUESTION:

10

Well, has there ever been a judgment

11

against a sheriff in Alabama in a civil case or a 1983

12

case in the history of Alabama?

13

civil judgment against the sheriff in his capacity as

14

sheriff?

15

MR. STEVENSON:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. STEVENSON:

18

Has there ever been a

Yes.

And have the judgments been paid?
Not necessarily by the counties,

no.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STEVENSON:

But have they been paid,

It depends on the solvency of

21

the sheriff.

22

collected by the individual sheriff,

23

yes, the answer to that question is yes.

24
25

somehow?

If you mean, can the -- can a judgment be
I think that's --

That is, we can recover from the sheriff, but
our position is obviously that where the sheriff was able

1

to effect Mr. McMillian's, the petitioner's arrest, and to

2

put him on death row pretrial, and to suppress evidence

3

that was withheld from the prosecution, he did that

4

because he had the power and status given to him by the

5

county.

We think that 1983 ought not limit the remedy -QUESTION:

6

Well, maybe it was given to him by

7

State law, or by the State constitution.

8

sheriff had the power and the authority to take the

9

actions apparently that he did.
MR. STEVENSON:

10

Certainly the

Well, yes, but under Alabama law

11

the provisions that deal with the conduct in question here

12

make it clear that he exercises that authority for the

13

county.

On page -QUESTION:

14

Well, I suppose -- correct me if I'm

15

wrong.

16

liable for the acts of the -- for the judgments of the

17

sheriff, that would not necessarily follow in a 1983 suit,

18

because you'd still have to comply with Monel1.

19

I would suppose that if in Alabama the county is

MR. STEVENSON:

That's right, and we think

20

that's how the Eleventh Circuit dealt with this issue.

21

The Eleventh Circuit held that because the sheriff's law

22

enforcement authority is not shared with some other county

23

official, that the county is somehow not liable.

24
25

We think that's a misconstruction of this
Court's opinion in Monell and its progeny, and this Court

1

has never held that only local legislative bodies can make

2

policies for which a county is liable.

3

Just in the same way that a mayor can create a

4

policy that the city council is not responsible for, the

5

city council does not control, he nonetheless makes a

6

policy, if it's final, that would subject the city to

7

liability.
QUESTION:

8

9

Are you asking for a rule that if the

final policymaker is elected by an entity -- here, the

10

county -- that entity is necessarily responsible for the

11

judgment?
MR. STEVENSON:

12

Not -- it does not turn entirely

13

on the election by the county's voters.

14

an important element, Justice Kennedy, but it's not the

15

only element.

17

Here --

QUESTION:

16

We think that's

What else is there?

I really don't

see what else you rely on.
MR. STEVENSON:

18

Yes.

Well, there are several

19

things.

The second factor, in addition to the county's

20

election, the voter's election, is that the county pays

21

for, the county equips, the county funds, the county

22

provides the resources for all of the sheriff's law

23

enforcement functions, and the county actually does that

24

with some discretionary authority.

25

reasonableness language in the statute that deals with the

1

commission's authority to authorize a budget and to

2

authorize expenditures.

3

The third thing --

4

QUESTION:

5

You say the county does this, but the

county does this under compulsion of State law.

6

MR. STEVENSON:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It's directed by State law.

It's not

8

a matter of self-governance in which the county decides,

9

we will provide so much money to the sheriff.

10

MR. STEVENSON:

That's correct, Your Honor, and

11

that's true of all of the county's functions.

12

the county commission exercises its authority over roads,

13

et cetera, under --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STEVENSON:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

That is,

In this State, but not in all States.
That's correct.

States do have charters in which the

counties are self-governing.
MR. STEVENSON:

That's correct, and I guess our

19

position is that that's not required to trigger municipal

20

liability for these purposes.

21
22

23
24
25

The third thing is that the county's
authority -QUESTION:

Mr. Stevenson, before you get onto

the third thing -MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

QUESTION:

1

Staying with the money, do I

2

understand correctly that it's also the coroner and the

3

tax assessor that are paid by the county, but other people

4

who are elected -- say, the district attorney or local

5

judges -- are paid by the State?
MR. STEVENSON:

6

Is that --

That's correct.

In Alabama, the

7

district attorney is not necessarily limited to a

8

particular county.

9

The judicial circuit that was created for Monroe

10

County is a judicial circuit that includes other counties,

11

and so the district attorney receives his or her check

12

from the State, from Montgomery, Alabama, and that's true

13

for the judges as well, and so there's a distinction

14

between the sheriff and those other judicial officers.
QUESTION:

15

How about the coroner and the tax

16

assessor, who are paid by the county?

17

decisionmakers in their realm, unreviewable by the

18

commission, as well?
MR. STEVENSON:

19

Are they final

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

They are

20

county officials, paid by the county, elected by the

21

county.

22

Treasury, much like the sheriff, but yes, they have final

23

policymaking authority in their respective areas, inquests

24

for the coroner, tax assessments and that sort of thing

25

for the tax assessor.

They get their resources from the county

QUESTION:

1

2

The county commission, then -- and

that's your form of county government in Alabama?

3

MR. STEVENSON:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's correct.

-- could not instruct the tax

assessor to do things in a particular way?
MR. STEVENSON:

6

Not in compliance with Alabama

7

law.

There is no statutory authority for the county

8

commission to direct the conduct of any of these county
officials, and that's why we contend that there need not

10

be some sharing of authority before the county be liable.

11

The third thing, Justice Scalia, would be --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. STEVENSON:

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. STEVENSON:

I knew you'd get back to me.
Yes.

The third thing would be the

16

jurisdiction of the county.

Alabama law has created 67

17

counties.

18

matters in the area of law enforcement because the sheriff

1

here cannot conduct any law enforcement functions outside

20

that jurisdiction.

They have legal status.

21

The fourth thing --

22

QUESTION:

23

third for a minute.

That legal status

Well now, wait, let's talk about the

QUESTION:

Okay.

Are you saying anything other than

1

the sheriff has no authority outside the geographical

2

limits of the county?

3

MR. STEVENSON:

Well --

4

QUESTION:

5

necessarily a county official.

6

State officials, each of whom has jurisdiction within each

7

of the various counties.

8

MR. STEVENSON:

I don't see why that makes him
Certainly you can have

Yes, but I guess my point would

be that if they're State officials that are part of some
10

State command, then their jurisdiction and their authority

11

and their ability to perform the functions which they have

12

been trained and prepared for aren't necessarily limited

13

to that jurisdiction.

14

to another division.

15

The chief of command may pull them

For example, we have a Department of Public

16

Safety in Alabama that has ABI agent, Alabama Bureau of

17

Investigation agents dispersed across the State.

18

be assigned to a particular area, but if the head of that

1

division decides to move them to another part, to

20

Birmingham or Mobile, there's nothing about their status

21

or their function or their jurisdiction which limits that.

22

QUESTION:

They may

What about the prosecutors you

23

referred to earlier, the State prosecutors, whose

24

jurisdiction exceeds the county but does not exceed the

25

judicial district?

Can they be moved to another judicial

1

district?
MR. STEVENSON:

2

Yes, Your -- I don't know that

3

they could be moved in the sense that someone can assign

4

them, but they have authority to prosecute cases in other

5

counties at the direction of the court.
They have the authority to sometimes be sort of

6

7

prosecutors when there's some conflict between another

8

local prosecutor in another jurisdiction, and the

9

defendant or the victim in a particular case, so in that

10

sense I think they're more properly seen as state

11

officials who might be able to exercise some legal

12

authority in some other area.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STEVENSON:

Are they elected by the county?
They're elected by the judicial

15

circuit.

16

the county, then everyone in that judicial circuit would

17

be the voting --

18

That is, if the judicial circuit is bigger than

QUESTION:

Is that any different from the

19

sheriff of one county being able to enter into another

20

county in hot pursuit?

21

Do you have any hot pursuit law?

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I think it's different in

22

this way, Justice Scalia.

There may be exceptions where

23

exigencies might give the sheriff the opportunity to

24

conduct some conduct, but they're recognized as

25

exceptions.

They're recognized in some ways as giving

1

permission to the sheriff to exceed lawful authority.
QUESTION:

2

I understand that, but it seems to me

3

that the instances you were describing of the prosecutors

4

being able to act elsewhere were also exceptional

5

instances.

6

district to which they're assigned.

7

Basically, they were limited to the judicial

MR. STEVENSON:

I think that's a fair criticism,

8

but I think it's less exceptional both as a matter of

9

practice and as a matter of law, for the prosecutor to

10

11

engage in this kind of conduct some place else.
And I think this point is emphasized by the next

12

thing I'd stress, which is that Alabama law requires that

13

another elected county official take over law enforcement

14

functions if the sheriff cannot perform them.

15

the county coroner under Alabama law assumes law

16

enforcement functions for those circumstances and times

17

when the sheriff can't do that.

18

That is,

I think that's because the State law recognizes

19

that the county, the county's residents, have some

20

investment, have some stake, have some authority over at

21

least the selection in that limited circumstance of who

22

should be performing the law enforcement functions in that

23

particular community.

24

The other things that I would point to would be

25

the many references in Alabama law that clearly designate

1

the sheriff as a county official.

2

brief, and I'll cite again or just acknowledge again that

3

the Alabama code -- and this is at our brief at page 21 --

4

expressly identifies as county officers the sheriff of

5

Alabama -- the sheriff of a particular county.
QUESTION:

6

The constitution I think identifies

7

him as a State official.

8

MR. STEVENSON:

9
10

We've cited in our

What the constitution does,

Justice Breyer, is identify him as a member of the
executive department, and we don't dispute that.
When you look at that language, however, what

11
12

the constitution says is that the sheriff is a member of

13

the executive department, and the words they use are,

14

sheriff for the county.
QUESTION:

15

I'd like to get your answer to this,

16

which is the problem that's bothering me the most from

17

your point of view.

18

If I looked at Alabama law, the supreme court of

19

Alabama, in what I'd think is the most closely analogous

20

area, the most closely analogous question would be, for

21

State law purposes, is this sheriff a person under tort

22

principles where the county is held liable under

23

respondeat superior, and the Alabama supreme court says

24

no.

25

It says the sheriff of a county for jail

purposes is not considered an employee of the county for

2

purposes of imposing liability upon the county, so if

3

that's Alabama law, and they're saying for purposes of

4

imposing liability, respondeat superior in tort, he's not

5

a county official, how do you get around that problem?

6

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I think that Alabama law

7

is in conflict on the question, on that particular

8

question in part because the Alabama courts have clearly

9

said that they want to immunize both the State and

10
11

counties from tort judgments for this kind of conduct.
We don't think, though -- obviously that's not

12

going to resolve the Federal question, which, as this

13

Court has always acknowledged --

14

QUESTION:

But what would the -- but when you

15

say conflict, I have a case here called King v. Colbert

16

County, May 7, 1993, and it seems to say quite clearly the

17

sheriff is not considered an employee for purposes of

18

imposing liability upon the county.

19

MR. STEVENSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. STEVENSON:

That's right, Justice Breyer.

Is that in conflict?
That's not in -- there's no

22

conflict about the tort liability of the State or the

23

county with regard to --

24
25

QUESTION:

All right, so then why should 1983

impose respondeat superior constitutional tort liability

1

upon a body that States do not impose respondeat superior

2

liability upon?

3

MR. STEVENSON:

It shouldn't.

The Federal

4

question here does not require this Court to impose

5

respondeat superior liability.
If you accept our view, you recognize that the

6

7

sheriff is the county official who engages in law

8

enforcement authority for the county, so in that sense, he

9

is the master.

He's the superior.

No one is under his

10

control in a way, or he's not under someone else's control

11

that we're asking you to make that party liable.
What the Alabama counties have done is shield

12

13

counties and States from liability.

14

can do under State law.

That's something they

But it's our position that Federal -- section

15
16

1983 was intended to provide Federal remedies for people

17

like petitioner --

18

QUESTION:

But you are asking us to hold the

19

county liable for the actions of the sheriff.

20

if you were saying, we're just after the sheriff.

21

MR. STEVENSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

It's not as

No, that's right, but --

So that is respondeat superior in a

sense.

24

MR. STEVENSON:

25

is that it's not in this respect.

Mr. Chief Justice, our position
We're -- our position

1

is that because the sheriff is a county official, because

2

he does exercise final policymaking authority for the

3

county, and the county controls that sheriff in the sense

4

that they elect him, the county funds that sheriff in the

5

sense that they pay for his or her conduct, and that that

6

sheriff is tied to that jurisdiction, that there is this

7

nexus between the county and the sheriff that does not

8

make this respondeat superior.
When Congress was talking about respondeat

9
10

superior, this kind of vicarious liability in 1871, they

11

were dealing with the Sherman amendment which was trying

12

MR. STEVENSON:

1

That's true, Your Honor, but

2

with regard to whether the State law immunities bind this

3

Court, it is certainly our position that that's not true.

This Court has always held that Federal law cannot be

remedies under these kinds of actions.

Well, suppose it were the other way

Supposing the Alabama supreme court in the case

that Justice Breyer has discussed said that the county is

liable for what the sheriff -- it seems to me that you

would certainly cite that, and you would have an open and

shut case.

13

MR. STEVENSON:

QUESTION:

16

Well --

So why doesn't it work the other way

around?
MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I think if that was all

that was said, that is, if the sheriff was not elected by

18

the county's officials, if the sheriff did not have this

1

relationship to the county government, the county

Treasury, the county as a jurisdiction, we might still

21

have a problem, and I guess that's why I'm saying that the

22

Congress doesn't resolve this issue.

Under Regents and all of these Court's -- this

1

resolves these kinds of questions, and I think that's

2

consistent with what Congress was trying to get at.

3

Certainly Congress did not intend, in 1871, to

4

provide this Federal remedy only to have State courts then

5

decide that the constitutional officers or the county

6

officials involved in this kind of conduct can be shielded

7

from Federal remedies by designating them as something

8

other than the county officials that the rest of the code

9

identifies them as being.

10

And Justice Breyer, my conflict term was a term

11

not about tort law per se, but about all of these other

12

provisions in the Alabama code that clearly designate the

13

sheriff as a county officer, and the supreme court, the

14

county official in other contexts.

those -- do that kind of conduct.

MR. STEVENSON:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Is the same -- is the answer to

Justice Breyer's question about respondeat superior the

4

same thing with respect to those officers, or is the

5

county liable for their common law torts?
MR. STEVENSON:

6

The county is liable for the

7

coroner's conduct.

8

deals with the tax assessor in that context.
QUESTION:

10

I'm not aware of any State law that

So the State does have -- the county

has respondeat superior liability for the coroner.
MR. STEVENSON:

11

Yes.

Again, I would resist the

12

framing of that liability as respondeat superior.

13

view, the tax assessor and the coroner are different parts

14

of the power structure of the county government, just like

15

the mayor and the city council and the aldermen.

terminology -QUESTION:

5

The city itself hasn't done

is it, some semantic legal category that I've never seen

I think that's a fair statement

of
QUESTION:

I mean, any corporation is liable

we're worried about respondeat superior here is that we've

got a case that says we don't have respondeat superior

22

liability under 1 83 in the sense that there's got to be a

policy condition met, but respondeat superior is a

variety, certainly, of imputed liability, and this is

imputed liability, right?

MR. STEVENSON:

2

QUESTION:

3

And in Alabama they say there is no

imputed liability as between the sheriff and the county.

4

MR. STEVENSON:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

That's correct, Your Honor.

With regard to State law.

With respect to State law, and you

say that's a Federal question, and that does not bind us.
MR. STEVENSON:

That's correct, because the

8

county does engage in the kind -- the same relationship

9

that exists between the county commission, about whom I

10

think we'd have to concede does have authority to make

11

policy that would create liability for the county, the

12

same relationship between the county commission and the

13

county, that entity.

14

And you're right, that county, that city, can't

15

go out and arrest somebody, or subject someone to the kind

16

of conduct that our client was subjected to.

17

QUESTION:

The same --

When we're interpreting Monel1, why

18

don't we use -- why aren't the same policies that inform

19

that decision as to respondeat superior applicable equally

20

as well to imputed liability?

21

MR. STEVENSON:

Because I think that the

Congress intended to make localities liable.

QUESTION:

That is, the

It intended to make municipalities

liable because they were like corporations.

That's why we

1

decided Monell the way we did, that in fact they were

2

municipal corporations, but surely it is an essential

3

characteristic of a corporation that its board of

4

directors can decide what happens within that corporation.

5

But you're coming before us here and saying that

6

this is a corporation which should be liable under 1983.

7

However, the sheriff is not subject to the commands of the

8

board of directors of the corporation, namely the

9

governing body of the county.

That's what troubles me the

10

most, that this doesn't fit into the whole theory of

11

section 1983 liability for municipalities, which is that

12

they are like corporations.

13

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, I think two things,

14

Justice Scalia.

15

this corporation we have to imagine a board that has not

16

only a county commission but a sheriff, a tax assessor,

17

and a coroner, so in that sense we're not asking for you

18

to do anything different than you would do in that

19

traditional context.

I think in imagining the structure of

This is just a corporate structure that has four

elements:

has four heads.

You're saying it's just a person that

I mean --

MR. STEVENSON:

5

Well, I think --

Well, that's the second thing

6

I'd say.

7

it clear they were talking about bodies politic and

8

corporate to embrace just these kinds of jurisdictions

9

where the power is separated, where the power is directed

10

11

That is, when Congress passed this law they made

to various officials.
I mean, in some ways it would be I think sort of

12

exceeding the Court's authority to impose on

13

municipalities a single view of governance, that single

14

view meaning that you have to have a single corporate body

15

that makes all of your policy decisions in order for that

16

municipality to govern.

17

I mean, Alabama has chosen to divide these

18

powers in the ways that provide the sheriff with some

19

functions, the county commission with some other

20

functions, and the tax assessor and coroner other

21

functions, and I don't think that the Federal law would

22

require that to change.

23

QUESTION:

But the decision was not to make

24

counties liable.

That was not the 1983 decision.

25

decision was to make corporations liable.

MR. STEVENSON:

That was the

be it was also to make these political bodies that have

unconstitutional conduct, to empower someone to do the

make those municipalities liable for that conduct.

they are, who trigger Monell liability?

20

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes.

I think this Court's

21

decision in Pembaur is precisely such a situation, where

22

this Court found that the county sheriff and the district

23

attorney had final policymaking authority in the area of

24

search and seizure and arrest, and that the county could

be held liable for that conduct, and in a variety of

So it's not a novel notion to hold some other

2

entity, other than the local legislative body, as a final

policymaker who can create policy that makes -- that binds

First, the State constitution, as has been

1

noted, expressly designates sheriffs as State officials,

3

and follows up that designation by treating them as State

If what you're asking is, can there

15

be a situation where we would -- where the Court would

16

properly disregard a label that says he's a State

17

official, based on other circumstances that are present

18

such as the fact that he actually day-by-day works for the

19

county commission and so therefore there's a concern that

20

the State statute that designates him a State official is

21

fictitious, I think under those circumstances that would

22

be appropriate.

23

Because the two factors that I was going to

24

outline at the beginning were 1) what the law says the

25

scope of the municipal corporation is expressly, and 2)

who does this official work for and is he -- who is he

2

controlled by, and I do think there are situations where

3

if, in fact, the person is controlled by the governing

4

body of the municipal corporation, that fact would be

5

enough to make him a municipal policymaker regardless of

6

the express statements of law.

7

QUESTION:

But the converse would not

8

necessarily be true, would it?

9

MR. SMITH:

10

QUESTION:

Well, I think -If he is not controlled by in this

11

case the county commissioners, it does not follow that he

12

is not a county official for purposes of 1983 liability.

13

MR. SMITH:

That's true, too.

I think if it

14

were true that he was expressly designated a county

15

official by law, and the court determined that the State

16

statute said this is the county policymaker for X area of

17

governmental activity but we want him to be autonomous

18

from this other governing body over here, I can imagine

19

State law doing that, too, defining the --

20

QUESTION:

Suppose they said just the latter?

21

They said, we want him to be autonomous from the county

22

governing body, but we're calling him what he is, a county

23

officer that works within the county, not outside, but

24

he's not in any sense answerable to the commission.

25

MR. SMITH:

Right.

3

QUESTION:

Okay.

Is he a final policymaker for

the county for whom there is Monell liability?
MR. SMITH:

If the Court were to determine that

4

the State law establish the contours of the municipal

5

corporation such that the corporation includes not only a

6

governing body but another autonomous board or official

7

who was supposed to be part of that municipal corporation,

8

that you have a kind of hydra-headed corporation under

9

State law, if the Court were to conclude that's what State

10
11

law said, then yes, he would be a municipal policymaker.
So you can have a situation where autonomous

12

boards or officials are within the scope of the municipal

13

corporation because that's what the State decided to do,

14

and it may be fairly frequent in big cities.

15

QUESTION:

So if this person were designated

county officer, as I take it the coroner and tax assessor

are, then you would not have any question about --

If you're asking about those

21

specific individuals, I think that there's -- there are --

22

those are kind of border-line cases where there's

indications that go both ways.

designation of a State official that we have here with the

QUESTION:

He's supervised very closely by

Let's stay with the

coroner then.

As to the coroner, he's elected in

QUESTION:

11

Yes, but so -- but you're saying that

12

that officer would be considered a decisionmaker, final

13

decisionmaker, although not responsible to the county

14

commission, and there would be municipal liability or

15

county liability.

16

MR. SMITH:

My position, Justice Ginsburg, is

17

that's certainly possible, that if the full analysis of

18

the law about the coroner came to the conclusion that the

19

State intended him to be a county officer making policy

20

for the county, his autonomy from the county commission

would not by itself preclude that conclusion that he is

MR. SMITH:

1

Well, you would look at what State

2

law says about whether he's part of the municipal

3

corporation or not, and here the State law's quite

4

explicit on that subject and says not only is he

5

autonomous from the county commission, but he is a State

6

officer who is a member of the State executive department.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Smith, your second point, as I

8

understand it, was the label itself is not enough.

9

couldn't just pass a statute calling somebody a State

10

You

officer, as I understand you.
You look at actual control to have significance,

11
12

and in this case if you ask about the day-to-day

13

activities of the sheriff, not things that would justify

14

impeachment or failure to reelect, but whether he assigns

15

four officers to a district or two patrol cars and so

16

forth, who controls him in that regard?
MR. SMITH:

17

Well, with respect to his day-to-

18

day activities, many of them are controlled by other State

19

officials.

to put his patrol cars he's got a fair amount of

discretion.

QUESTION:

1

Going back to Justice Souter's

2

question before, if that's the test of the -- if the

3

question is who can control him, I suppose the people who

4

have the greatest power, just as Justice Souter mentioned

5

before, to control the actions of the sheriff are the

6

county voters, because if he doesn't do the right thing

7

they won't elect him again.
And so if that's the test, why isn't he then a

8

9

county official?

Indeed, any State official who is

10

elected on a county basis would become for Monell purposes

11

a county official.

12

who pay the piper call the tune, and they're paid at a

13

county level and he's elected at a county level.

14

MR. SMITH:

Why not?

That's fairly clear.

Local election doesn't tell you

anything about whether a particular official is part of a

municipal corporation separate and apart from State

government --

No, no, no, that's all quite right,

actions?

1

MR. SMITH:

But with respect, Justice Breyer,

2

the reason that we have public liability under Monell is

3

because there are separate corporate structures that

4

exist, and so saying that he's locally elected and locally

5

funded may be relevant to the question of whether he's a

6

local official --

7

QUESTION:

He was a separate -- I just think

8

that probably Monell basically -- well, different

9

people -- I don't know if we'll go into that in great

10

depth, but basically you're trying to say the people, or

11

at least where it's policy, whom you work for normally

12

pay, but of course they don't if it's the State --

13

MR. SMITH:

14

QUESTION:

Well, of course, they don't --- because there's sovereign

15

immunity, so the real question is, should the sovereign

16

immunity principle apply here, and you say why should it

17

when they're elected at a county level.

18

MR. SMITH:

The reason that the State doesn't

19

pay under 1983 is not sovereign immunity, Justice Breyer.

20

It's that the statute only imposes liability on persons,

21

and the only reason there's liability on anybody other

22

than the individual wrongdoer in any case is because

23

municipal corporations are treated as persons.

24

to get there you have to look at whether or not we have a

that those factors tell you literally nothing about

Is there any individual for whom a

Certainly.

There's a county

administrator who's essentially there, keeps the paperwork

flowing and deals with routine matters within the scope of

9

the areas that are run by the county commission.

could be done by people who work for the county in the

it makes the attorney general the policymaker, but because

the law in the Constitution expressly differentiates

between State and local officials on the kind of

QUESTION:

Suppose a State, or a sheriff in the

State of Alabama runs on a platform and he says he's going

be to interpret Federal constitutional rights at their

narrowest when he's interrogating prisoners.

6

Certainly in a lay -- and if the voters vote him

7

in, certainly in a lay sense, in a common sense use of the

term, we could say this is the policy of the voters of

MR. SMITH:

You sure could, yes, but that

11

wouldn't be the test that should be applied under Monel1.

QUESTION:

It's just clearly

Mr. Blackburn, do I understand from

your argument both on brief and here this morning that you

think that the First Circuit in the Blackburn v. Snow case

7

reached the wrong conclusion?

8

MR. SMITH:

9

I do.

I think it was focusing on a

county as a unit of geography and not as a municipal

10

corporation and said, to the extent that he's elected by

11

the county voters, we're going to treat him as a county

12

official, and I think that test is both unjustified under

13

the principles of Monell and proves far too much, because

14

you have lots of locally elected State officials who under

15

any theory, other than just looking at election, wouldn't

16

be viewed as part of the municipal corporation.

No, but you could have -- I mean, not

that I necessarily want to defend an opinion in which I

was on the panel --

QUESTION:

Nonetheless, I guess in that, what I

thought that that was involving is that you can't have a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN A. STEVENSON

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. STEVENSON:

I'd like to at least suggest

13

that the Court not accept this notion that the sheriff is

14

a State policymaker under the law that's been provided.

15

There are two provisions which point to the

16

sheriff having some State identity, the constitutional

17

provision, which we contend is a label and is at best

18

ambiguous, because the label says, sheriff for the county,

19

and then the State tort law judgments, which we contend

20

are not relevant here.

21

The rest of Alabama law repeatedly refers to the

22

sheriff as a county officer, and the Eleventh Circuit did

23

not hold the sheriff makes policy for the State precisely

24

because, as Justice Stevens suggests, that's kind of a

25

difficult notion.

He is not like the Department of Public

What the respondent then tries to say is,

because there is this removal authority, somehow the State

5

exercises control.

6

applicable to all county, municipal, and State officials.

7

They can remove a mayor, a county commissioner, a city

8

9

this question.

The removal authority in Alabama is

evidence as to why the sheriff is not a State policymaker.

In those provisions the sheriff is never

And then finally, if we're not going to accept

election and funding and status as a county official as

the governing rationale, then the county commission's not
