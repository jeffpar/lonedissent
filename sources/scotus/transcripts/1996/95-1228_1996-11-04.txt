ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether section 1014

12

of title 18 requires the Government to establish the

13

element of materiality in order to obtain a conviction.

14

Section 1014 prohibits any person from knowingly

15

making any false statement or report or willfully

16

overvaluing any land, property, or security for the

17

purpose of influencing any one of a number of covered

18

financial institutions in any application, advance,

19

discount, purchase, purchase agreement, or a number of

20

other listed transactions.

21

not require proof of a materiality element.

22

The text of the statute does

Notwithstanding the absence of that explicit

23

element, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth

24

Circuit in this case concluded that an element of

25

materiality should be implied into the statute in order to

prevent it from being applied to what it viewed as trivial

2

misstatements.

3

Our contention is that that holding is

4

incorrect, and that section 1014 does not require proof of

5

materiality, for three reasons.

6

statute does not require proof of materiality.

7

the history of the statute shows it to be a consolidation

8

of a number of provisions, the vast majority of which did

9

not require proof of materiality, and third, the Eighth

10

Circuit's policy concerns are misguided in light of the

11

statutory requirement of proving that the individual

12

knowingly made a false statement and that he did it for

13

the purpose of influencing the institution.

QUESTION:

Well, not theoretically, would be

covered by your construction of the statute.
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, it would.

I'm talking about

4

what in fact tends to get prosecuted under section 1014,

5

and in our experience, Federal prosecutors do not bring

6

cases based on such extraneous or --

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

9

MR. DREEBEN:

10

They're mostly Yankee fans, we know.

Currently, yes.

But our main point is, is not that we need

11

section 1014 not to require proof of materiality because

12

we need to go out and prosecute immaterial false

13

statements.

14

element of a statute that Congress did not require us to

15

prove, and therefore it should not be read into the

16

statute by courts, and second, it can cause a distraction

17

to juries considering prosecution of false statements when

18

the issue of materiality is in the case, and therefore

19

Congress had particular -- had valid reasons for not

20

requiring the Government to prove the materiality.

21

Our main point is that first is a implied

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose under Gaudin, too,

22

there would be a lot of 2255 proceedings in cases where

23

the court had determined materiality for itself if -- by

24

people who had previously been convicted --

QUESTION:

1

-- if we held materiality was a

2

statutory requirement.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

That is exactly right.

The law

4

prior to this Court's decision in United States v. Gaudin

5

was fairly tilted against the Government under this

6

statute with respect to implying the element of

7

materiality, but that element was determined by the trial

8

judge, not by the jury, and as a result there would be an

9

arguable constitutional issue for a defendant to raise on

10

a 2255 subject to defenses such as the requirement of

11

overcoming the cause and prejudice hurdle and of other

2

potential issues as well, but our -QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, most courts of appeals

have said materiality is an element, haven't they?

the majority.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

That's

Yes.

And you say they're wrong.
Yes.

They are wrong for three

basic reasons, as I began at the outset.

Let me first

20

address the text itself.

21

is set out at pages 2 and 3 of our brief, does not require

22

any explicit proof of the materiality of the false

23

statement.

24
25

The text of section

It has three elements.

0 4, which

It requires that there

be a false statement, which is the actus reus of the

1

offense, and it has two intent requirements.

It requires

2

that the defendant know that the statement is false, and

3

it requires that the statement must be made for the

4

purpose of influencing the institution with respect to one

5

of a number of enumerated financial transactions.
In contrast to the deliberate exclusion of any

6

7

materiality element from this statute, Congress has

8

enacted a number of other statutes that deal with the

9

problem of false statements that expressly require proof

10

of materiality, perhaps the most prominent being the

11

perjury statutes, 18 U.S.C. 1621, and 18 U.S.C. 1623, both

12

of which explicitly require proof that the false statement

13

be material to the proceeding.

14

QUESTION:

15
16

What was the jury instruction given

here?
MR. DREEBEN:

The jury instruction given here,

17

which is set forth at pages 42 and 43 of the Joint

18

Appendix, informed the jury not that the court had found

19

the statements to be material, I think it's important to

20

emphasize that.

21

of the statement or representation alleged to be false or

22

concealed is not a matter with which you are concerned,

23

and should not be considered by you in determining the

24

guilt or innocence of the defendant.

the Joint Appendix.

What the court said was the materiality

That's on page 43 of

Now, the court had also earlier enumerated the

1
2

elements of section 1014 to include materiality.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DREEBEN:

5

And where is that?
That's on the prior page of the

Joint Appendix, page 42.
But that was a correct statement of circuit law

6

7

at the time.

The Eighth Circuit, like the majority of the

8

courts of appeals, had implied an element of materiality

9

into the statute, and the Government in this case, if it

10

wished to obtain a conviction that it could affirm on

11

appeal, complied with circuit law.
QUESTION:

12

13

Now, no objection was made to these

instructions?
MR. DREEBEN:

14

Well, the defendant -- the

15

defendant did object.

The defendant argued that

16

materiality should be decided by the jury in the trial

17

court.

18

convicted.

The defendant was convicted.

19

On appeal --

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Both defendants were

But the Government was satisfied with

the statement that it is -- materiality is an element?
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, I wouldn't

23

describe the Government's position as satisfied.

I would

24

describe the Government's position as attempting to obtain

25

a conviction in compliance with Eighth Circuit law.

then gone to the trial judge and said, don't make any

9

He would have

Well, so how's the question preserved

here?
MR. DREEBEN:

10

The question is preserved because

11

when the case was decided in the court of appeals the

12

Eighth Circuit received briefs from both parties before

13

United States v. Gaudin was decided and heard oral

14

argument.

15

materiality should have gone to the jury, as they do now.

16

The Government didn't argue that materiality is not an

17

element of 1014, as we do now.

18

addressed the question of whether these false statements

19

were material.

20

At that point, respondents didn't argue that

Both parties simply

Then the United States v. Gaudin was decided,

21

and the Eighth Circuit asked the parties for supplemental

22

briefs on the impact of that decision.

23

respondents said, there's been a constitutional violation

24

in this case because the jury did not decide materiality.

25

At that point,

The Government responded, there has not been a

constitutional violation in this case because section 1014

2

does not require proof of materiality.

3

The Eighth Circuit, which could have applied, I

4

suppose, some version or another of procedural default

5

against either or both parties, decided not to apply any

6

version of procedural default to either party --

QUESTION:

Exactly, decided on the merits

binding circuitwide decision which we are challenging in

materiality to be an element.

purpose finding that they were required to make?
That is to say, as you yourself argue to some

3

extent the purpose finding hinges upon materiality.

going to be a rare case where you have a purpose of

misleading an institution where what you're talking about

6

is something that's immaterial.

7

hypothetical is an unusual one.

8

It's

I mean, the Yankee

Now, why wasn't this jury misled by telling
them, never mind -- never mind materiality?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Scalia, we -- I

11

certainly agree that the instruction is not correct as we

12

understand section 1014 to be read.

13

whether the particular error of the judge instructing the

14

jury that it should not be concerned with materiality is

15

sufficiently harmful as to warrant overturning this

16

conviction.

17

The question is then

This case is actually, I think, a -- proof that

18

the purpose-to-influence element can readily be

19

established without inferring that from proof of actual

20

materiality of the statement.

21

Here's how the purpose-to-influence element is

22

established in this case.

These respondents were engaged

23

in a -- the business of leasing copiers, with an integral

24

agreement that they would service the copiers.

25

an arrangement with one bank where the bank knew about

They had

11

1

that integrated agreement and said, you -- we will buy

2

these agreements from you, cash them out for you, but we

3

will require you to set up a reserve account to protect

4

the service part of your contract.

5

The respondents needed more money.

They went to

6

another bank who also knew about the integrated agreement

7

and it said, we want the same reserve account.
At that point, respondents said, that's not

8

9

going to give us enough money, we don't want the reserve

10

account, so they entered into this conspiracy to break

11

this integral agreement into two separate pieces of paper

12

and presented to the banks that are the victim banks in

13

this case, only the lease, not the service.

14

And I think that from that sequence of events

15

alone, a jury was virtually compelled to infer that the

16

false statements about this nature of a contract were for

17

the purpose of influencing the banks, but if that wasn't

18

enough and compelling in itself, one of the coconspirators

19

was a cooperator with the Government and testified

20

explicitly that's why we all did it.

21

agreed.

22

QUESTION:

That's what we

But Mr. Dreeben, we don't have

23

directed verdicts in criminal cases, and this judge in his

24

instruction number 20, if you were sitting on the jury,

25

wouldn't you think that the judge had made the

1

determination that the representation was material,

2

because the judge first says it must be material, and then

3

he says, you don't worry about that, because that's for me

4

to determine.

5

But if a jury is to come in with a verdict of

6

guilty or not guilty, mustn't the jury assume that a judge

7

has made the finding that this was material?
MR. DREEBEN:

8

9

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think

the jury could speculate that way, but the instruction

10

doesn't say that.

11

with it, and if the jury is following the instructions

12

given, it won't concern itself with it.

13

QUESTION:

It simply says, don't concern yourself

Well, but it says somewhat more than

14

that.

It defines what materiality is a few sentence -- a

15

few paragraphs before.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

17

QUESTION:

That is true.

So a knowledgeable jury, as I think

18

Justice Ginsburg is suggesting, would say, well,

19

materiality is important in this case, and it's been

20

established.

21

MR. DREEBEN:

22

QUESTION:

I think --

Suppose in this case the judge said,

23

I instruct you as a matter of law that this is material.

24

He didn't say that.

25

Suppose he said that.

QUESTION:

2

No, no, let's assume -- let's assume

3

that you prevail, and the question is whether or not the

4

case has to go back.
MR. DREEBEN:

5

That's right.

Then it's a

6

conventional harmless error question which I think is

7

rather factually confined to the record in this case.

8

The question would be, would that erroneous

9

inference from the instruction, or if the instruction were

10

explicit, which it is not, was the explicit instruction

11

that the statements were material have tainted the verdict

12

in this case, I think that, given that our position is

3

materiality is not an element, and that there was ample

direct evidence, coconspirator admission and sequence of

events evidence that established that the purpose to

needed to and would not have relied on any inference it

drew from the materiality instructions in this case.

QUESTION:

But

Did the judge ever later tell the

jury he had decided it was material?
MR. DREEBEN:

Not that I'm aware of, Your Honor.

not aware of any supplemental instructions that were given

before the time of verdict, so I think that there should

beyond what the instructions actually said and conclude

that the judge made some finding that he should not, and

It's not a question that has long run factual

I simply think that the judgment in this case

QUESTION:

Does the instruction become the law

of the case somehow?
MR. DREEBEN:

There is some lower court

19

authority to that effect, that an instruction can become

20

the law of the case, and I think the issue here would have

21

been for the Eighth Circuit, if it had chosen -- it

No.

I do not think that this

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. DREEBEN:

That --

Why not?
Because at most it would be a

13

question of discretion for a court of appeals to decide

14

whether it should conclude that the Government's posture

15

in the district court precluded it from making the

16

argument that it made on appeal, and I think that quite

17

properly the Eighth Circuit in this case said before we

18

find a constitutional violation based on the failure to

19

have the jury decide materiality, we should at least be

20

satisfied that the statute requires that to be proved, and

21

it does not -- none of the cases that respondent cited in

the judge, I think, drew a distinction between statements

2

and omissions, and he said an omission would not be false

3

in his instruction unless it were of a material fact.

4

Now, if you had a statement which was literally

5

true in all respects, but there was a material omission

6

that made the overall presentation a violation of the

7

statute, would it not then be necessary to show the

8

omission was material?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

My answer to that is no, Justice

10

Stevens, but I need to explain what I think are the kinds

11

of omissions that are covered by this statute, because

12

this statute in its terms prohibits false statements or

13

false reports.

14

concealment or omissions per se.

It does not in its terms prohibit

a bank and is asked to list their assets and liabilities,

big ones.

an omission of material information, or an omission of

21

information.

22

properly construed as a false statement.

23

That is occasionally described by the courts as

therefore it's not accurate.

2

statement.

4

That can be called an

A second kind of omission could occur in a case

5

like this one, where a party has one integrated agreement.

I lease you the copier, I service it, but artificially

7

divides the agreement into two parts, gives the bank the

8

lease agreement, withholds the service agreement.

9

That I think also could be colloquially

10

described as an omission or a concealment, but it really

11

also is a false statement.

12

that the respondents drafted said, this is the entire

13

agreement between the parties, the lessee has

14

responsibility for service, in fact the lessee did not

15

have responsibility for service, and it wasn't the

16

complete agreement between the parties, so in those kinds

17

of cases I think we're really talking about false

statements.

Now, a third kind of omissions case, I suppose,

could be purely the omission of information that might be

1

to cover that, and there are statutes that expressly cover

2

concealing or covering up material facts, and those

3

statutes would apply perhaps to such a scheme, depending

4

on whether the Government had proven all it needs to prove

5

in a concealment case, but that's not a violation of

6

section 1014.

7

Now, in this case I think the parties in the

8

court of appeals used the words concealment when they

9

really meant false statement, and the district court's

10

opinion rejecting the respondent's rule 29 motion in this

11

case, which is contained in the record, although not in

12

the materials that this Court has available to it in the

13

briefs, very clearly said that the contracts the

14

respondents claim are literally true, and the Court said

15

the contracts without the addenda are not, in fact,

16

literally true, they are false statements and affirmative

17

misrepresentations in the lease as submitted to the banks.

18

So this case does not, I believe, contain a true example

19

of what might be described as an omission.

20

Now, the trial court did, as Your Honor points

21

out, instruct that it has to be a concealment of a

22

material fact.

23

the statute is first doesn't apply to naked omissions, and

24

second, to the extent that it does apply to omissions as

25

I've described, they don't have to be material.

In our view, the correct understanding of

purpose of influencing the bank.

4

Mr. Dreeben, if your interpretation

5

of the law is correct, how should instruction number 20,

MR. DREEBEN:

What should the judge and

11

there should be no reference to materiality at all.

Second, the requirement that the statement or

representation be false when it is untrue when made, I

14

think at that point if the court amplifies on it at all it

15

should be done to respond to the particular facts of the

16

case, and should explain that the statement must be false

17

or must be misleading because of omitted information.

18

And then perhaps in a case such as I've

19

described where the list of liabilities is incomplete, the

20

court might explain at that point that's what's meant by

21

the false statement in this case, but there isn't any

requirement of materiality.

MR. DREEBEN:

The court of appeals' concern seemed to be that

without materiality this statute would become a vehicle

answer to that argument is contained in the statute,

itself, which has the requirement that the Government show

a purpose to influence the institution in a financial

Mr. Dreeben, do any of the statutes

MR. DREEBEN:

9
10

Yes, some of them do.

The

statutes are not uniform in that construction.
QUESTION:

11

So the mere existence of a purpose

requirement does not exclude the possibility of

13

materiality being a requirement as well.

14

MR. DREEBEN:

That's right.

The legislature has

15

complete control over how it arranges these particular

elements of the offense and the language of the statute is

17

the best guide to what it has selected.

concerned about the consequences of a case if we don't

MR. DREEBEN:

the sentence in this case.

was only $40,000.

The sentence is so low because

In fact, the probation department had found that

the loss was over $1 million, and the Government's pending

responsibility for the maintenance was in fact literally

13

true, and was done and presented to the banks in that

fashion with their knowledge, at least in part as to a

separate agreement, because the banks wanted to be not

With respect to the issue of the signature by

the individuals here before the Court or their wives, we

had two positions on that, one of which was, it was not

to go back to the Eighth Circuit anyway because the

3

Government wants a substantial sentence imposed in this

4

5

Going back to your point, Mr. Chief Justice, we

6

believe materiality is an element for a number of reasons.

7

We cannot ourselves, as we've looked at it, make any clear

8

determination in our own mind that when this statute was

9

amended, that in fact Congress intended to omit the

10
11

element of materiality.
There were some 13 statutes at the time that the

12

consolidation was designed to bring into one statute.

13

Three contained a requirement of materiality.

14

the remaining 10, seven had a requirement that there be an

15

intent, or the intent element was for the purpose of

16

influencing, and three did not.

17

I think of

The reviser's note simply says that no

18

substantive change was intended here, and if that was the

19

case, then presumably at least on some of the statutes

20

materiality was still an element.

QUESTION:

But may I ask, had any of the 10

22

statutes that did not have the materiality element

23

expressly in the statute, had any of them been construed

24

judicially to include such an element?

The law is pretty clear that these matters would

have to be preserved in the trial court and, given the

status of the law at the time, I don't think that's a

serious concern.

Mr. Justice, is that on the false statement issue, that

materiality is a part of that definition, and when the

But purpose was not.
Purpose was not -Purpose was not part, so ---on the false statement part.
Yes, all right, but where's the

prejudice, if in fact the judge was right in not giving

10

the materiality issue to the jury, but for the wrong

11

reason?

What's the prejudice your client suffered?
MR. WYRSCH:

12

We urge you not go beyond the

13

purpose requirement, but on the false statement

14

requirement, because the definition of false statement

15

would have required it be material, when the court took

16

that away from the jury, it took away from them the

17

determination as to whether or not these statements were

18

false.

If you're wrong about whether

MR. WYRSCH:

Yes.
If you're wrong about that, what

23

prejudice did your client suffer from the judge having

24

mentioned it when he didn't let the jury decide it?

MR. WYRSCH:

First of all, in two ways.

case wasn't tried that way, and we have a jury finding now

2

that necessarily would have included in some way or not

3

these issues of materiality.

4

Secondly, with respect both to the intent issue

5

and purpose, and with respect to whether it was false, we

6

were greatly prejudiced by the judge taking it away from

7

the jury, because those two elements necessarily would

8

require the issue of materiality, and in fact, and I know

9

I'm repeating myself, that's exactly what the court

10

defined.
In it's, and I think it's Instruction 20, he

11

12

said that a false statement wouldn't necessarily have to

13

be material, and then he said, but you're not to be

14

concerned with that, so it took away from them a very

15

substantial element with respect to that matter, and

16

therefore we were very substantially prejudiced, and I

will also say that the whole -- for an example on

prejudice and whether materiality is an element -QUESTION:
