ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT E. BABCOCK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BABCOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit has awarded John Rambo

11
12

compensation not because he has a disability, but because

13

the panel perceived a possibility that disability would

14

some day occur.

15

not first determined to have a loss of earning capacity.

16

It has awarded compensation to a worker

The panel took this action to prevent the

17

running of a time limit on modification.

18

despite this Court's clear direction in the previous

19

opinion involving the same claim that a claimant is not

20

disabled unless and until he proves an incapacity to earn

21

wages.
QUESTION:

22

It did so

Well, do you take the position that

23

it would be improper for the ALJ to ever make such an

24

award?

25

MR. BABCOCK:

To ever make a nominal award?

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

2

MR. BABCOCK:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, I do.

Because certainly the -- I guess the

4

Solicitor General agrees with the respondents that in

5

interpreting the act and the language of the statute that

6

such an award is possible, focusing on the language of

7

section 908(h).
MR. BABCOCK:

8

9

The Solicitor takes the position

that if a disability is shown, i.e., if an individual is

10

proven to have in all probability a loss of earning

11

capacity, then such an individual could, in the

12

Solicitor's opinion, properly receive a nominal award.

13

The Ninth Circuit went further than did the

14

Solicitor and said that if it's possible that there will

15

be a loss of earning capacity, hence the Solicitor's

16

request for remand - -

17

QUESTION:

I don't understand what you're

18

saying.

If there is a loss of earning capacity and you

19

insist that it be a present one -- right?

20

MR. BABCOCK:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

No, I do not.

You do not.

So you agree with the

Solicitor General.
MR. BABCOCK:

I think there has to be a current

24

determination that there is a loss of earning capacity.

25

The process of determining may certainly look forward into

the future.

2

I do not agree with the Solicitor General

3

because they want to substitute - - the Ninth Circuit

4

speculates -- substitutes doubt and speculation for the

5

basic question of whether there is a disability.

6

might be,

If there

they'd say that there could be a nominal award.

7

The Solicitor says, not quite that far, but

8

instead let's substitute this doubt for something else,

9

and that's the other element that's necessary to prove a

10

compensation award.

11

QUESTION:

12

I'm not sure of what you're saying.

You want to explain it to me again?

13

MR. BABCOCK:

14

QUESTION:

I'll try.

I thought the Solicitor General was

15

saying that if there is a determination that there will in

16

the future be a loss of earning capacity, although there

17

is none now, nominal damages can be awarded.

18

MR. BABCOCK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BABCOCK:

21

Yes, the Solicitor says that.

And you disagree with that?
Yes, because there's another

element required to receive compensation.
A disability, an unspecified, unmeasured proof

22

23

of a loss,

the loss has to be measured, and what the --

24

the process would be a claimant would prove in a normal

25

claim proceeding I have a disability and here is evidence

1

that will allow you, administrative law judge, to

2

determine the degree, because without the degree you can't

3

determine the compensation.

4
5

The numerator is the wage, the denominator is
the earning capacity that exists post injury.
QUESTION:

6

Well, let's take a case that's not

7

hypothetical so we won't be talking about this in the

8

abstract.

9

Somebody is physically injured, a severe back

10

and leg injury, as in this case, is promoted from the line

11

job that he can no longer do to a manager's office, and

12

the ALJ thinks there's a good chance, better than not

13

chance that this guy just won't make it, and within 2, 3

14

years he'll be out of work.

15
16
17

From the answer you've given to Justice O'Connor
and Justice Scalia, I take it you would say tough luck.
MR. BABCOCK:

No.

I would say that you may find

18

a disability but you have to have more to give the award

19

of compensation.

20

allow the administrative law judge to fix a figure as

21

section 8(h) requires, fix a figure.

22

You have to have evidence that would

QUESTION:

The Solicitor --

Well, what figure would you fix --

23

this man is earning as a manager twice what he earned in

24

the factory.

25

MR. BABCOCK:

Well, in that -6

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. BABCOCK:

3
4

So how would you fix a figure?
It would depend upon the evidence

presented.
The classic case that we deal with with some

5

frequency is, an individual is earning more.

6

individual comes in and says, but I don't think I'll keep

7

up this pace for long.

8

says, I don't think he'll keep up the pace.

The

He brings in a doctor.

The doctor

Now he's

10

Next step, though, in order to get an award of

11

compensation, how much is he losing, and the doctor in a

12

very simple example might say, I don't think he'll be able

13

to work for more than 4 days weekly.

14

Now the administrative law judge has a basis for

15

making a figure, for fixing a figure, but until he has

16

that basis in the evidence, he can't --

17

QUESTION:

Well, what if the doctor were to say,

18

he can keep going in my view for probably 5 years, but

19

after that he's going to go down?

20
21

MR. BABCOCK:

I think the administrative law

judge would need more to fix a figure.

22

QUESTION:

What more would he need?

23

MR. BABCOCK:

How long the individual is going

24

to live -- excuse me, going to work, what he can go to

25

after that time -7

But that could all be determined at

MR. BABCOCK:

The doctor says he can only stay

in longshoring for 5 years.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. BABCOCK:

He puts on proof saying after that

he can be a security guard.

remaining 5 years and the earnings available as a security

So there can never be nominal

There can never be nominal damages, is your

QUESTION:

20

With those two pieces of

That is my position, because --

I thought you said earlier that you

weren't saying categorically there could never be.
MR. BABCOCK:

Nominal damages are a substitute

for a real award. It's an ersatz version for a real award.
QUESTION:

Well, except that it seems to me it

21

responds to this problem.

We might indeed all agree that

22

there is some degree of probability or possibility that

23

the individual in the future is going to suffer in fact an

24

incapacity which right now is subject to so many

25

contingencies that nobody could reasonably estimate it.

1

So we in effect say yes, there is a possibility

2

there, but it's a very tiny one, and we don't know how to

3

give it a more specific figure than that, therefore the

4

appropriate thing to do is to give it a very tiny award.

5

Give it a dollar.

6

reflects a nominal possibility, or a nominal probability.

7

Why isn't that consistent with the act?
MR. BABCOCK:

8

9
10

That's a nominal award which in fact

right, with what is just and what is fair, but it is not
consistent --

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BABCOCK:

13

It may be consistent with what is

No --- with the 1-year time

limitation.

14

QUESTION:

But the act speaks of disability in

15

the future, and on the hypothesis I was giving there is a

16

very slight chance, there is some chance, more than zero,

17

that there will be a disability in the future, because in

18

fact something the individual used to be able to do to

19

earn his living he can no longer do now, so that there is

20

something more than zero.
So on that assumption there is a finding of a

21
22

possibility, more than zero, of some disability in the

23

future.

24

of something more than zero, but not much, to reflect that

25

disability.

Consistent with that is to give a nominal award

disability as a possible future loss of earning capacity.

3
4

QUESTION:

7

It defines it as a present one,

doesn't it?

5
6

Well, the act doesn't define

MR. BABCOCK:

It defines it as a loss of earning

capacity.
QUESTION:

Shouldn't I just -- I think probably

8

I should have changed my hypothesis and said, the fact

9

that we can make this probability or possibility judgment

10

about what will eventuate at a future time is reflective

11

of a nominal disability now.

12

consistent with the act and, as you say, fair?

13

MR. BABCOCK:

Isn't that a) both

No, I think it's not consistent

14

with the act, because I think it ignores the limitation of

15

section 22.

16

QUESTION:

All right.

Take the hypothesis in

17

which he can become a crane operator, or heavy equipment

operator, whatever it was, tomorrow, so that you say

there's no disability here.

He's earning three times his

Assume that we know, for whatever reason, that

22

that work, at least in the area where he is, is probably

23

going to exist for only about 6 months.

I take it on your theory there would be no
present disability, because for the immediate --he has

1

the immediate prospect of earning money even though we

2

know on the hypo that in 6 months he'll be -- he won't be

3

able to earn the heavy equipment money, nor will he be

4

able to go back to his lifting job.

5

MR. BABCOCK:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BABCOCK:

Not at all.

Okay.
But we deal with these cyclical

8

types of industries all the time in the shipyards, and you

9

make an assessment of how long he's going to be able to do

10

that work, the judge gets additional evidence of what

11

other types of work there are available on the open labor

12

market, and from that evidence, not from a substitution of

13

speculation or possibilities, from that evidence he

14

determines what that earning capacity is.

15

QUESTION:

Okay.

So it's a question of degree,

16

then, because that -- in theory that's not different from

17

the earlier example.

18

The earlier example recognizes the possibility

19

of something that may happen in the future, whereas the

20

example of the 6-month heavy equipment job recognizes a

21

near certainty, so I take it the difference is, is simply

22

one of the predictive degree.

23

MR. BABCOCK:

No, sir.

I think the difference

24

is one of whether you're substituting something, a

25

possibility or a predictive degree for evidence, and this

There's an evidentiary basis for

The question still remains, what

is his numerical earning capacity?

and cents - -

13

There are some

QUESTION:

What is, in dollars

And for the present time the

14

disability is at most of nominal value, so put a nominal

15

value on it.

16

QUESTION:

Why do you say he has a disability?

17

I thought he doesn't have a disability until you establish

18

that he has a reduction in earning capacity.

MR. BABCOCK:

QUESTION:

One can look for --

I thought it was your case that he

did not have a disability.

MR. BABCOCK:

QUESTION:

No, my -- I -- everybody --

No, wait.

If he can't do heavy

lifting any more but he can operate a crane, do you

concede that he therefore has a disability?

MR. BABCOCK:

QUESTION:

3

No.

Okay.

Well, that's -- I thought you

just did.

4

MR. BABCOCK:

5

QUESTION:

No.

If I did, I sure --

But you also concede, I take it, that

6

although he can do the crane operation, it is possible --

7

you would dispute it on these facts, but it is perfectly

8

possible and legally appropriate to find that his present

9

crane-operating capacity is not reasonably reflective of

10
11

his overall earning capacity.
MR. BABCOCK:

It's possible on some facts to

12

find that, but the administrative law judge reached the

13

contrary conclusion.

14

his wage-earning capacity loss had ended, which is

15

tantamount to saying his current earnings are

16

representative of his future capacity to earn.

17

QUESTION:

The administrative law judge found

Well, that may be a reason, then, for

18

saying that this individual -- if the ALJ's finding in

19

that respect is not disturbed, that this individual

20

shouldn't have gotten his nominal damages, but it would

21

still leave the door open for nominal damages had the ALJ

22

said, a) at the present time he can earn three times as

23

much, so that there is not in fact in actuality right at

24

the moment a loss of earnings, but b) this capacity to

25

earn is not reflective of his earning capacity for the

long haul, and therefore I want to put a figure on what

2

the capacity is.

3

It's hard to put a figure on it, because there

4

are so many future contingencies, so I'm simply going to

5

say, there is some possibility, and reflect that some

possibility in a nominal award.

That theoretically would

That theoretically is possible,

but I think inappropriate, because -QUESTION:

10

Well, Mr. Babcock, what do we do here

11

in this case if we disagree with you and think that in

12

some appropriate case it is possible to determine future

13

economic harm as a disability for someone that would

14

entitle that person to some nominal damages award?
Do we have to vacate and remand here so that

16

that can -- the ALJ can at least answer the question?

possibility of future economic harm is a sufficient basis

for a nominal award, and you conclude that a nominal award

If, in addition to the evidence that was

presented at the time you terminated the disability there

had been evidence that the higher paying job would only

last 6 years, say, and then he would be working as a night

computations.

an award that reflected -- that would stay in effect

2

indefinitely, or could he give a nominal damage award in

3

that kind of case to be adjusted later?

4
5

MR. BABCOCK:

Well, that's why the nominal award

concept is both a shield and a sword - -

QUESTION:

Right.

7

MR. BABCOCK:

-- for both claimants and

8

employers.

In the purest view of the longshore system he

would have to do what they do now, which is make that

10

assessment and give an award which overcompensates during

11

the period that he continues - QUESTION:

12

That's what you think he should do.

13

He should overcompensate temporarily and then perhaps

14

undercompensate later.

MR. BABCOCK:

this system, yes, sir.

QUESTION:

I think that's the structure of

That's exactly the question I have.

I mean, because I want to know what -- obviously, this

particular man was earning $500 a week before he was hurt.

20

Now he's earning $1,500 a week after he's hurt, so it's --

21

he may not be a person who will end up being benefited by

this.

If you look among the circuits, in the Hole case

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

2

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT

3
4
5

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The position of the Director of the Office of

6

Worker's Compensation Programs is that a continuing

7

nominal award is appropriate whenever an injured claimant

8

has no current loss of earnings but is more likely than

9

not to suffer a loss of wages at some point in the future

10

as a result of a covered injury.

11

that the court of appeals erred in this case in ordering a

12

continuing nominal award.

13

We believe, however,

Now, with respect to the propriety of continuing

14

nominal awards, I think the heart of our submission is

15

that such an award in appropriate cases is not an

16

extrastatutory device, it's an award given to the claimant

17

who satisfies all of the statutory prerequisites for an

18

award of benefits, and for that proposition we would rely

19

primarily on the language of section 908(h), which is

20

reproduced at page 2 of the Government's brief.

21

QUESTION:

Do you think that this is a

22

reasonable award within the meaning of 908(h)?

23

think that a reasonable one means you calculate what the

24

reduction of earning is as best you can.

1

One dollar is not as best you can.

2

You're just saying I can't calculate what it is, so I'm

3

just picking a number out of the air.

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, we think that in determining

5

an award that is reasonable the administrative law judge

6

should take cognizance of the entirety of the statutory

7

scheme.
Now, if there were no provision for a

8

9

modification of awards, if the award that was originally

10

entered by the ALJ was to be the award for the rest of the

11

claimant's life no matter what condition changed, then the

12

ALJ's only alternative would be to do as you suggest,

13

which is take its best shot at estimating the loss that

14

the claimant would incur over the course of his lifetime

15

and enter an award which was designed to compensate him

16

for that loss even though that would mean overcompensation

17

in the early years and perhaps undercompensation in the

18

future.

19

The great virtue of section 922's modification

20

provision is that it sharply reduces the need for

21

speculation.

22

nominal award will preserve the claimant's right to seek

23

modification down the road, and at the same time it will

24

avoid the risk of overcompensation that would occur if the

claimant got - -

QUESTION:

Was that just in - - because it felt

bound by court of appeals decisions, or on its own?

7

MR. STEWART:

I think that was on its own, and

8

the reason I say that is, we cited at page 20, footnote 8

9

of our brief the relevant benefits review board's -- board

10

decisions, and one of those was a case called Morin, M-o-

11

r-i-n, and that case arose out of Maine, and there was no

12

First Circuit decision on point that addressed the

13

question of continuing nominal awards, so I think the fact

14

that the board in Morin evidently regarded the practice of

15

continuing nominal awards as legitimate indicates that it

16

wasn't simply acquiescing in binding circuit court

17

decisions in the relevant circuits.
QUESTION:

18

Well, they couldn't adopt one

19

position in some cases and another position in other

21

acquiescence in a case from the First Circuit doesn't mean

it wasn't pushed there by the fact that it was getting all

there was binding circuit precedent saying continuing

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, could an employer ever

2

cut this out by saying -- take this case.

3

he's continued to work as a crane operator, we now again

4

ask for a changed circumstances ruling, to cut out the

5

nominal damages?

6

MR. STEWART:

Yes.

For 5 years

I mean, we believe that the

7

standard at any given time is whether it is more likely

8

than not that the claimant will suffer a loss of earnings

9

at some point in the future, and even if a nominal award

10

were entered at one point, if years went by and in fact

11

the claimant showed that he was able to keep his higher

12

paying job, the employer could move for a modification on

13

the ground that it was now no longer more likely or not

14

that the claimant would suffer a loss of earnings at some

15

point in the future.

16

In further response to your question, Justice

17

Breyer, about where these awards came from, historically

18

they came from the ALJ and then were approved by the

19

courts of appeals.

20

I think in terms of where in the statute does

21

the authority reside, there are really two provisions of

22

section 908(h) that we think are relevant.

23

The first is the provision that says the ALJ in

24

determining wage-earning capacity should look to the

25

effect of disability as it may naturally extend into the
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

future, and we think that provision would be meaningless

2

if the ALJ were required to set wage-earning capacity by

3

reference to the wages that the employee was currently

4

capable of earning.

5

And with respect to the question, why can the

6

ALJ award nominal benefits as opposed to taking a shot at

7

estimating likely losses in the future, we think the

8

statute gives the ALJ wide discretion in that it says that

9

the ALJ may, in the interest of justice, fix such wage­

10

earning capacity as shall be reasonable, and we think that

11

encompasses the freedom not only to weigh the facts, but

12

also to consider the totality of a statutory scheme.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, on the other question,

14

even though you argue that there can be nominal damages

15

you say in this case there's no basis for it and the ALJ

16

simply found that this was a case in which nominal damages

17

were not appropriate.

That is your --

18

MR. STEWART:

19

QUESTION:

Well --

That is apparently not the

20

petitioner's position.

21

he concedes that if we disagree with him on nominal

22

damages this case should be remanded to the ALJ.

don't think so?

24
25

MR. STEWART:

1

its own precisely because the resolution of that question

2

would depend on factual findings that the court of appeals

3

was not competent to make.

4

I mean, essentially, as a practical matter we

5

know that Mr. Rambo is not going to earn less than he was

6

earning at the time of his injury for so long as he

7

continues his current job as a crane operator, but since

8

there's been no showing that his physical condition has

9

changed, if he should lose his job as a crane operator and

10

be unable to find similar work, there's every reason to

11

believe that he will be impaired in his ability to obtain

12

alternative longshore employment.

13

QUESTION:

So when you say probable, when you

14

talk about the probability judgment, the probability

15

judgment is not a probability judgment that there will be

16

work as a crane operator and he will continue to do it, or

17

be unable to continue to do it, the probability judgment

18

simply is that there is one kind of wage-earning physical

19

activity that he cannot do now, and so long as that

20

probably is shown, the nominal damage award is

21

appropriate.

MR. STEWART:

22

23

Is that correct?
No, that's not our position, with

respect.

is more likely than not that Mr. Rambo will at some point

Hasn't the ALJ found here that it is

12

claimant's average weekly wages more than tripled from

1980 to '90.

14

I mean, the ALJ says, this demonstrates that

After taking into consideration the increasing

15

wages due to rate of inflation, blah, blah, it is evident

16

that claimant no longer has a wage-earning capacity loss.

17

Although he testified that he might lose his job at some

18

future time, the evidence shows that claimant would not be

19

at any greater risk of losing his job than anyone else.

20

And it goes on like that.

I - - as I read this

21

ALJ determination, it's a finding that there is no

22

probability of future reduction.

MR. STEWART:

I think the one thing that the ALJ

left out is, the ALJ said, he is no more likely to lose

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT RAMBO
MR. PIERRY:

17
18

Thank you, Mr. Stewart.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Nearly 2 years ago in Rambo I, this Court was

19
20

presented with the issue of what conditions justified

21

modification of a permanent disability award under section

22

922 of the act.

Rambo II presents this Court with very different

24

issues.

year limitation in section 922, the primary issue before

2

this Court is whether or not nominal awards are authorized

3

by section 908(h).

4

This is because the act defines disability in

5

terms of loss of wage-earning capacity, and it is section

6

908(h), not section 922, which provides the methods to

7

determine the wage-earning capacity of an injured worker.

8

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Pierry, did the ALJ decline to

make an award in this case, nominal or otherwise, because

10

he felt he had no authority to make nominal awards?

11

that what he thought?

12

MR. PIERRY:

13

QUESTION:

Is

I don't believe so, Your Honor.
Yes.

I read his opinion as believing

14

he had the authority, but simply finding on these facts no

15

nominal award was justified.

16

MR. PIERRY:

The problem is, as we have pointed

17

out, I think the Solicitor has also pointed out, there was

18

a failure to consider, at least a failure to write down in

19

the opinion various factors that have been outlined in

20

section 908(h) as important to consider when determining

21

loss of earning capacity of an injured worker.

employer, and I agree with the Solicitor -QUESTION:

MR. PIERRY:

are mentioned in 908(h)?
MR. PIERRY:

11

I think he has to at least go

12

through most of the factors and indicate that based upon

all of the factors which have been considered relevant in

14

the determination of loss of wage-earning capacity he does

not find any loss of wage-earning capacity.

Your Honor, I have quoted it in my

brief, and I forgot it.

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

But what you're suggesting is it

4

would be a routine thing, and more formal than

5

substantial, if it's just that, I list these things, I've

considered every one of them, and that's it.

7

MR. PIERRY:

Well, I think as to certain factors

8

that are very important factors, such as the factors that

9

are set out in 908(h), those ones at least should be dealt

10

with in a very substantial manner by the administrative

11

law judge.

12

QUESTION:

Well, what do you mean?

Two

13

sentences is substantial, or - - let me ask you another

14

question, which I think you answered, but I want to be

15

sure that I have your answer right.

16

The law was less than clear and certain on

17

nominal damages.

18

for a long time, and the circuits didn't get into it until

19

the eighties.

20

The benefits review board resisted it

Is it clear that in this very case that issue

21

was focused before the ALJ so that when Mr. Rambo, who was

22

receiving weekly benefits as a disabled person, was

23

threatened with the termination of his benefits, the ALJ

24

knew that that was one of the things he could have done?

25

MR. PIERRY:

Well, Your Honor, the record is

1

unclear in that regard.

2

that the administrative law judge felt that he was faced

3

with was whether or not to terminate benefits based upon

4

the earnings that Mr. Rambo was experiencing, the higher

5

earnings, so I don't believe there really was an explicit

6

determination of that fact.

7

I believe that the main issue

One thing I would like to point out though that

8

makes this case different and unique from all of the other

9

nominal award cases, different from Hole and LaFaille and

10

Randall, is that all of those cases arose out of an

11

initial claim hearing, where the claimant has the burden

12

of proof of coming forward and proving that he has a

13

disability.

14

This claim arises out of a modification

15

proceeding where the claimant has already established that

16

he has a disability, and --

17

QUESTION:

But did his lawyer in that

18

modification proceeding initiated by the employer, did

19

Rambo's lawyer ever say to the ALJ at least give us an

20

award of nominal damages?

21

MR. PIERRY:

Did it enter the fray at all?

No, I don't think so, Your Honor,

22

and I think as the Ninth Circuit stated Rambo's contesting

23

of termination of his benefits also included his assertion

24

that he's entitled to any lesser amount under --

thought about -- what's bothering me in the statutory part

2

of this case is that I guess Mr. Babcock says, read that

3

statute.

4

They have some words called wage-earning

5

capacity.

6

the world, past, present, and future, but it ends up with

7

a number, even if it's a guess, and subtract from that

8

existing wage-earnings, or whatever, and divide by two-

9

thirds, all right.

Those are two numbers plus a division.

Now, this is providing a jumping system, isn't

10

11

That's a word that you can look at anything in

it?

12

MR. PIERRY:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And he says, how do we make that

14

consistent with those words, wage-earning capacity, and at

15

that point, I think maybe the SG's interpretation is

16

within the envelope, but it should be the Secretary of

17

Labor to whom we defer on such matters, that has thought

18

this thing through.

We

Has this

1

interpretation of the statute, and they advance it, in the

2

history of these cases?

3

MR. PIERRY:

Your Honor, I guess what I'd point

4

to is really the language of Congress in terms of the

5

state of the art in section 908(h).

6

When they list the qualitative factors, such as

7

consideration of the nature of the injury, the degree of

8

physical impairment, whether or not the claimant can do

9

his usual employment, those are all things where it is

10

difficult to imagine how you could ever get to a

11

particular dollar amount.

12

And I think that when Congress listed that we

13

should consider the effect of his disability as it may

14

naturally extend into the future, they realized that it

15

may be impossible at times to accurately give a particular

16

dollar amount and therefore they envisioned nominal words.

17

In fact, I have quoted the 1983 and '84

18

committee reports which certainly let us know that

19

Congress is aware of the fact that these type of nominal

20

awards were being issued and they did nothing to change

21

the system.

22

And also, what I think is important about those

23

committee reports is that there is a concern expressed, a

24

main concern, I believe, that without these type of awards

25

claimants are going to be coming in and filing yearly

requests for modification because they aren't allowed to

2

get a nominal modified award, and that would present an

3

administrative nightmare, and I think that's why

4

Congress -- that's at least a good explanation of why

5

Congress didn't change the system.

6

Your Honor, to follow up on your question, if

7

there is no provision for nominal awards, there is what

8

the circuit courts have termed an onerous burden on the

9

administrative law judge to try to determine what exactly

10

the loss of wage-earning capacity is in a case where there

11

is serious medical disability.
As the court of appeals stated in the Randall

12

3

case, the act requires omniscience of the judge.

4

to determine whether the claimant will suffer any work-

5

related reduction in his earning capacity at any time in

6

his lifetime.
QUESTION:

He has

Well, that's not any different from

what happens in a normal civil trial, which I assume is

the model.

that the Solicitor referred to that it was a judicial

infringement on the time limitation.

15

They've always quoted in the eighties opinions

My point is, the main point, I think, of the

16

petitioner -- of the respondent, rather, is that section

17

922's time limitation does not even enter into the fray

18

when we're talking about what type of remedy is allowed to

19

be fashioned.

20

Rather, section 908(h) is the section which

21

specifically directs how earning capacity of an injured

22

worker is calculated, and therefore the section 922 1-

23

year limitation on modifications should not be seen as a

device that prevents entering any type of award.

If we didn't have the 1-year time limit there

MR. PIERRY:

That's exactly right.

In fact, as

committee suggested limiting both the forward-looking

7

language of section 908(h) and the 1-year time limitation

unnecessary and also would reduce the specter of this

administrative nightmare of yearly requests of filing

the burden of proof and what that burden of proof is

2

depends on at what stage of the proceedings the question

3

is raised.

4

At the initial claim, respondent would agree

5

with the Solicitor that it's the claimant who has the

burden of proof, preponderance of the evidence, that he

7

has to prove that it's more likely than not that at some

8

point in the future he will suffer a reduction in

9

earnings.

10
11

If he does that, then he's established a

disability.
Rambo did that in this case.

He established

that he had a disability, and he was not only awarded a

If that's true, that would even rule out

MR. PIERRY:

Your Honor, I believe that what the

21

ALJ -- the Ninth Circuit said about the ALJ's decision was

22

that the ALJ's decision did not take into account certain

23

specified factors, and therefore that his decision was not

24

supported by substantial evidence on the record considered

25

as a whole, and I believe that the Ninth Circuit, when

faced with the evidence that was presented, which really

2

was only the increase in earnings, they decided that -QUESTION:

3

Well, it was increase in earnings,

4

and also there was testimony that the man might

5

theoretically lose his job later, and so forth and so on.
MR. PIERRY:

6

That's correct.

That's correct.

7

But as far as the evidence the employer presented in terms

8

of supporting termination, I think the Ninth Circuit found

9

that there was not substantial evidence to support the

10

ALJ's finding that the employer had basically -QUESTION:

11

You see, part of the problem is that

12

your client at that stage of the proceedings did not argue

13

in the alternative, a) don't make any reduction, and b) if

14

you do make a reduction, don't terminate but allow me to

MR. PIERRY:

He didn't even raise that

was because he was relying on years of precedent

QUESTION:

Right, and I was very sympathetic to

his position, but he lost.

22

MR. PIERRY:

That's correct.
I take it your answer to that is,

send it back so that findings can be made on some of these

various factors that the court - - that the ALJ did not

2

wasn't it?

3

MR. PIERRY:

That was your earlier answer,

No, Your Honor.

What the

4

respondent's position is, that since the employer was the

5

one that had the burden of proof at the modification

6

proceeding, and the Ninth Circuit found that the ALJ's

7

decision that they sustained that burden of proof was not

8

supported by substantial evidence, that therefore the case

9

should be affirmed, and that if the employer then wishes

10

to go ahead and seek another modification hearing, it can

11

then - -

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. PIERRY:

14

QUESTION:

Start all over again.
Right.
Well now, is it a substantial

15

evidence -- I thought earlier your objection to the ALJ's

16

decree was not a substantial evidence one, but that he

17

hadn't made the necessary findings.

18
19
20

MR. PIERRY:

Your Honor, yes.

The ALJ didn't

specify the certain factors that I talked about in 908(h).
QUESTION:

So - - the provision of the

21

Administrative Procedure Act you referred to, by the way,

22

simply requires that the record include a statement of

23

finding and conclusions and the reasons or basis therefore

24

on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion

presented on the record.

Now, what had been presented on the record here

1

2

that wasn't -MR. PIERRY:

3

Well, that's the problem, Your

4

Honor.

In this proceeding the employer didn't present

5

evidence which it should have in order to sustain its

6

burden of terminating benefits.

7

It's respondent's position that if they wanted

8

to, the employer should have come in with rehabilitative

9

experts saying that there's no chance that -- or very

10

little chance that Rambo will lose his crane job, or that

11

there are many other jobs out there that he can do, or,

12

alternatively, they also could have come in with medical

13

evidence saying, his condition has improved.

14

other jobs he can do besides crane operator.

15
16
17

There's many

They chose to bring in none of that evidence,
and simply rely on the increased earnings.
QUESTION:

This is a substantial evidence

18

objection you're making, not a findings objection, it

19

seems to me.

20

MR. PIERRY:

Yes, Your Honor.

21

Your Honor, petitioner quotes the Potomac

22

River -- or Potomac Power case for the proposition that

23

the longshore act does not guarantee a completely adequate

24

remedy for all covered disabilities because it's a

25

compromise of competing interests and represents a

1

legislative choice.
The problem with that argument is that it fails

2

3

to address the fact that in section 908(h) the specific

4

legislative choice has been made.

5

broad, forward-looking language in section 908(h) which

6

represents the legislative choice in this area.

7

There is particular

The legislative choice is reflected in the

8

philosophy of the courts in Hole, LaFaille, and Randall

9

when they adopt this nominal award so that it can be

10

altered and amended as time proves it to be wrong or

11

correct.

12

QUESTION:

But the same language could be

13

honored by simply assigning present value and saying

14

that's good for all time.

15

now and too little later on a specific time period basis,

16

but we'll fix a present value just the way juries fix

17

present values in accident cases.

18

consistent with the statute, too, wouldn't it?

We may be giving you too much

That would be

19

MR. PIERRY:

That is correct, Your Honor.

20

I guess what I -- the respondent's point is,

21

there's nothing in the act that prevents issuance of

22

nominal awards, and since Congress chose not to prevent

23

them, neither should this Court.

24
25

QUESTION:

Is part of the problem that the 1-

year time limit works as a one-way street?

SUITE 400

That is, the

1

employer can always come in and say, we want a

2

modification, and the employee --

3
4

MR. PIERRY:

That's true, Your Honor.

It is a

difficult situation for the employee, the injured worker.

5

As I said, without nominal awards, the only

6

alternative for the employee is to come in every year and

7

request for modification simply to keep the statute of

8

limitations from running whether or not there's actually

9

grounds for it, and that's a difficult situation, I don't

10

think one that the courts would want to endorse, because

11

it creates, like I said before, an administrative

12

nightmare of all these requests for modification, perhaps

13

groundless, perhaps some of them have grounds, simply

14

filed just to keep the statute of limitations from

15

running.

16

QUESTION:

Well, maybe they could simply be

17

treated as nominal requests and knocked down.

18

take much time, and the rights would be preserved.

19

MR. PIERRY:

It wouldn't

That's true, but it would

20

definitely impede judicial efficiency and economy because

21

of all these requests that would be coming in from

22

claimants that had been denied.

23

Your Honor, petitioner's statement that the

24

longshore act does not guarantee a completely adequate

25

remedy sounds reasonable, or may sound reasonable and

1

applicable on first reading, but further examination shows

2

that it's really inapplicable in this context of nominal

3

awards.

4

defined in terms of wage-earning capacity.

5

That's because disability under the act is

As the Randall court stated, under the act, any

6

reduction in wage-earning capacity greater than zero is

7

compensable.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. PIERRY:

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Pierry -There's no question -Mr. Pierry, is it -- isn't it so that

11

anybody who has a physical disability, as Rambo certainly

12

did, anybody who has that, can always get one of these

13

nominal damages award, because there would always be a

14

risk that at some time in the future their disability,

15

physical disability would make it impossible even to do,

16

say, the crane work?

17
18
19
20
21

MR. PIERRY:

I would like that to be the case,

but I don't think that is the case under the law.
QUESTION:

Well, I'd like to see what is the

stopping point on your theory.
The Government has the more-probable-than-not, but on

22

your theory, isn't there always a risk that the disabling

23

condition will cause a reduction in earning capacity?

24
25

MR. PIERRY:

I don't think there always is.

However, what I would point to in this record is that the

1

nature of the injury and the degree of physical impairment

2

everyone concedes have remained the same as when Rambo was

3

first awarded the disability award of 22-1/2 percent.

4

In addition, there is testimony, as was pointed

5

out, that he didn't know how long this higher-paying crane

6

job would last, and --

7

QUESTION:

You're relying on the fact that this

8

is a proceeding to alter the original award.

9

Justice Ginsburg's question goes to the original award.

10

I think

What is your position as to whether an original

11

nominal award can be made?

12

probability that your wages will be lowered in the future?

13
14

MR. PIERRY:

What do you need to show, a

Yes, Your Honors.

I do agree with

the Solicitor in that sense.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PIERRY:

Okay.
At the initial claim proceeding I

17

believe that the claimant has the burden of proof,

18

preponderance of the evidence standard, that he will more

19

likely than not suffer some type of loss of earning

20

capacity in the future.

21

QUESTION:

But don't you say that he meets or

22

can meet that standard simply by proof that among the

23

spectrum of things that he might do to earn a living,

24

there is one thing that he can no longer do as well as he

25

did before, and therefore, given the contingencies of job

1

availability, there are some circumstances in which it is

2

more probable than not that he will not be able to earn

3

what he did before, and that satisfies the burden.

4

that your position?

5

MR. PIERRY:

No, Your Honor.

Isn't

I would say that

6

our position is that since the usual employment is a

7

specific factor that's listed in section 908(h), that

8

really is the key determination, whether or not his injury

9

affects or impairs his ability to perform his usual

10

employment, his usual pre-injury employment, and here

11

there's no argument that it did.

12

QUESTION:

No, but that will -- I guess that

13

takes me back to Justice Ginsburg's question.

Except for

14

the employee who in fact fully recovers, your theory will

15

always support a nominal award.

16

MR. PIERRY:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

17

because I believe that in this case the usual employment

18

is a broad category term, and he was a longshoreman before

19

this accident.

20

He's still a longshoreman.

He happens to be

21

doing lighter duty crane job work, but the great majority

22

of longshore work does require a lot of physical labor,

23

and there's no question that his disability impairs his

24

ability to do the great majority of longshore jobs that do

25

require physical labor.

QUESTION:

1

So if he had gotten another job as an

2

accountant, let's say, he got retrained as an accountant,

3

that wouldn't at all affect his entitlement to awards.

MR. PIERRY:

I guess -- I think it would depend

on the evidence, but I would concede -QUESTION:

Unless he was an accountant for -- I

they?
(Laughter.)

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. PIERRY:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

What don't longshore companies have.
There's a wide variety of jobs.
There must be something they don't

have.
MR. PIERRY:

But what I would say in that regard

15

is that I can envision circumstances where a claimant has

16

so completely changed industries, become an accountant or

17

a doctor or a lawyer, that in no way would ever require

18

physical labor, and he has also come forward, or someone

19

has come forward with evidence indicating that there is

20

very little chance that he will lose that type of job,

21

that complete termination could be justified.

22

don't think it is appropriate in this case.

23

I just

Your Honors, the mechanism of nominal awards

24

fulfills the forward-looking perspective of 908(h) and it

25

lifts the onerous burden from the ALJ.

It lifts the

burden inherent in any attempt to pick a disability figure

out of thin air, as the circuit courts have stated, rather

than simply assigning a nominal value and allowing it to

be changed at a later date.

5

QUESTION:

Just out of curiosity, do -- is it

your perception that employers generally like it this way,

or generally would rather have the ALJ guess as to what

the future will be?

All I know is they're -QUESTION:

This doesn't split out necessarily on

the basis of plaintiffs' versus defendants' preference.
MR. PIERRY:

I think employers generally don't

like to have nominal awards because they have to keep

their cases open, and they have to keep looking at cases,

18

rather than closing them.
