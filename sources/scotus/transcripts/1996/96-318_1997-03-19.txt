ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES R. RAY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. RAY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether correctional

12

officers who are employed by a private concern, who

13

perform traditional and historical police power functions,

14

and act under the color of law for 1983 purposes, should

15

have the benefit of qualified immunity.

16

Firstly, we would like to put forth the

17

proposition that should this Court extend qualified

18

immunity to correctional officers of this nature, that the

19

floodgates will not open, and qualified immunity will not

20

be willy nilly conferred.

21

Firstly, there are thousands, literally -- maybe

22

hundreds of thousands of contractors who contract with the

23

State of Tennessee, but only those who are found to act

24

under the color of State law as defined by this Court's

25

jurisprudence in Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison would be

1

needful of qualified immunity.
Secondly, only objectively reasonable actions on

2

3

the part of these private actors would give rise to

4

qualified immunity.

5

objectively reasonable under this Court's jurisprudence

6

they would not have the benefit of qualified immunity.
QUESTION:

7

Of course, if their actions are not

Mr. Ray, would you put together the

8

theory and the fact for me, because just looking at what

9

is alleged here, what would -- how would it not be clearly

10

established that it's a violation to take someone who was

11

over 300 pounds and put them in these tight restraints

12

that are bound to cause extreme pain?
We are talking about qualified immunity and

13
14

would a reasonable officer understand from the clearly

15

established law that you don't do this.

16

problem with this case.

17

MR. RAY:

18

point, and that's the issue.
QUESTION:

19
20

That is my

Justice Ginsburg, we never got to that

What would be the defense?

What

would be the defense for these allegations?
MR. RAY:

21

Well, perhaps under Woods v.

22

Strickland, if Mr. McKnight can establish that the acts of

23

our officers that he alleges were not objectively

24

reasonable, then we don't have benefit of qualified

25

immunity.

That is obvious.

But the district court -4

QUESTION:

Well, maybe it's an academic

question, that -MR. RAY:

Oh, that question is not academic, in

4

that there are literally hundreds of vexatious and

5

frivolous lawsuits filed --

6

8

9

QUESTION:

Oh, but I'm talking about in the

context of this case.
MR. RAY:

In the context of this case, Mr.

McKnight may well establish, if this Court should extend

10

qualified immunity to correctional officers who are

11

employed by private concerns, that our two officers don't

12

have the benefit.

13

QUESTION:

The Sixth Circuit decided this case

14

on the basis that qualified immunity wasn't available to

15

private contractors.

16

MR. RAY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. RAY:

19
20
21
22

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
So that's why we've got it here.
That's why it's here.

Duncan v. Peck,

which is their case -QUESTION:

My question I asked you is, what good

would qualified immunity do them if they had it?
MR. RAY:

Well, in cases on down the road where

23

their actions were objectively reasonable the

24

litigation --

QUESTION:

But not cases on down the road.

In

this case.

2

real case or controversy, so if you prevail, what good

3

would that do to these parties?

4

I mean, we do have to have a live case, or a

MR. RAY:

I would submit, Justice Ginsburg, that

5

this case would still have to be remanded to the district

6

court for that specific finding, that their actions were

7

not objectively reasonable and they don't have the benefit

8

of qualified immunity.
QUESTION:

9

Well, you make the argument for them

10

when you're saying, now I have the benefit of this

11

qualified immunity defense, so, district court, they are

12

qualified immune, and so the district court goes, tell me

3

what wasn't clearly established in relation to these

4

facts.

5

MR. RAY:

Well, the specific issue before this

6

Court is, we didn't get to that point.

7

said, based on the jurisprudence of Manis v. Corrections

8

Corporation of America, established by this Court, you

9

don't have qualified immunity, Mr. Ray.

20

here.

QUESTION:

Yes, but I'd just like you to tell

22

me, suppose he had qualified immunity.

23

with it?

25

You're out of

That's what the Sixth Circuit said.

21

24

The district court

QUESTION:

What could he do

He could try to prove his actions

were objectively reasonable.

MR. RAY:

1

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and

2

again, we may fail on that issue, Justice Ginsburg, but

3

the issue before this Court and what we want decided is

4

the fact that qualified immunity should be extended to

5

these individuals who act under the color of State law for

6

1983 purposes, are subjected to suit on a day-by-day

7

basis, and they perform traditional historical police

8

powers that this Court has extended qualified immunity to

9

their public counterparts in Navarette.

10

So we would submit that though we may ultimately not

11

prevail on that question -- that question is not before us

12

here -- the question is whether we get over the first

13

hurdle, i.e. -QUESTION:

14

The Sixth Circuit suggested that

15

there might be another standard short of qualified

16

immunity and said maybe good faith -MR. RAY:

17
18

The good faith defense.

That's

correct.
But the good faith defense, as you well know,

19
20

Justice Ginsburg, still allows us to be subjected to the

21

discovery process.

22

my clients we go through what may be needless and extended

23

litigation, expensive litigation, whereas if qualified

24

immunity applies, of course, that ends the dispute at that

25

point.

To discover the subjective mind set of

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260

1

So I would submit that the difference between a

2

good faith defense and qualified immunity is quite, quite

3

different, and the benefits that would be conferred not on

4

my two petitioners, but on the citizens of the State of

5

Tennessee, who would not have to bear the burden of

6

litigating what may turn out to be a frivolous and

7

vexatious lawsuit -- which again this Court's

8

jurisprudence from Harlow Ford has made it a consideration

9

that the benefit you want to confer is not on the actors,

10

but upon the citizens, who will benefit from not having

11

their officers, who perform a traditional governmental

12

function that utilizes a great deal of discretion, from

13

being impeded, deterred, made timid by threat of

14

litigation, and threatened with litigation.

15

So we would submit that the question here again

16

is whether you confer qualified immunity on officers who

17

historically have and do provide a fundamental

18

governmental function.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Ray, they do historically provide

20

a -- provide what was historically a governmental

21

function, but have they historically had such immunity?
I mean, we said in our earlier cases that this

22

23

qualified immunity is a matter -- it's not in the statute,

24

but we say that it came along with the history of the

25

statute.

That was simply what existed when this statute

2

was passed, and therefore we think it exists today.
Now, have you given us any evidence that a

3

private individual not employed by the State has ever been

4

given immunity?

5
6

7

MR. RAY:

Justice Scalia, if I could address

prison guards historically in the State of Tennessee -QUESTION:

Anybody historically, even if you

8

could come up with a medical officer who was privately

9

contracted for who somehow was given immunity, or a

10

private policeman.

11

shown even one example of this historical exception.

12

MR. RAY:

Anything.

I don't know that you've

I would submit that historically the

13

Attorney General of the United States at one time was

14

allowed to have a private law practice, and when acting in

15

his official function for the Government that I'm sure

16

that immunity would attach to him in any official acts.

17

In England, prior to 1871, when this particular

18

statute was promulgated, lawyers were both public

19

prosecutors and private prosecutors, and when they were

20

acting as public prosecutors I would submit that immunity

21

attached to them.

22

23

Those are the only examples I can suggest, but
let me state that --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. RAY:

It's a good one.
-- Pierson v. Ray, this Court started

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

out talking about a good faith immunity, which ultimately

2

developed over the course of this Court's jurisprudence to

3

the qualified immunity doctrine.
Pierson v. Ray dealt with police officers having

4
5

a good faith defense to malicious prosecution actions.

6

Tennessee, pursuant to statute TCA 4-3-609, correctional

7

officers have the same core functions, the same grant of

8

power as police officers do.

9

arms.

In

They have the right to bear

They have the right to take people into custody,

10

effectuate search and seizures, secure their facility from

11

both outside invaders or quell disturbances inside.
So I would submit that Pierson v. Ray -- I think

12

13

it was footnote 7 where Mr. Justice White cited ample

14

precedent that there was a historical basis for police

15

officers having -- excuse me.

16

footnote 7, that correctional officers have qualified

17

immunity.

18

That was Navarette,

Given the historical basis in Tennessee of there

19

being coextensive powers between police officers and

20

correctional officers, I would submit that the historical

21

basis is there.
QUESTION:

22

What about ordinary tort law?

That

23

is, a policeman or a correctional officer working for the

24

Government puts shackles on somebody, or hits them or

25

whatever.

That's a tort.

That's a battery.

1

MR. RAY:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Justice Breyer.

And there must be their -- State

3

officials, some kind of State law tort immunity that gives

4

a degree of leeway to a State officer who commits the

5

battery where he does it in good faith.

6

case, anywhere in any of these jurisdictions, that tells

7

us in respect to ordinary tort law whether a private

8

correctional official is treated similarly?
MR. RAY:

9

Is there any

The -- if I may answer it this way,

10

Justice Breyer, the public correctional officer, sovereign

11

immunity would suffice there.

12

QUESTION:

13
14
15
16

Not a suit individually against the

officer.
MR. RAY:

Right.

But you would go through the

court of claims.
QUESTION:

You sue the officer individually,

17

there will be some kind of public-based, not immunity, but

18

it will be a defense, and for good faith, et cetera, and I

19

just wonder if there's any case that you've come across --

20

it seems to me by now it should have come across

21

somewhere -- ordinary, garden variety tort law.

22

MR. RAY:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. RAY:

25

QUESTION:

The answer to that is no.
The answer to what is no -The answer is no, there's no --- that you haven't found a case, or

1

2

there's no case
MR. RAY:

I have found no case, but I would

3

submit that our private correctional officers do not have

4

the benefit of sovereign immunity and therefore would be

5

subject to tort law and subject to being sued in State

6

jurisdictions.

7

QUESTION:

And without a defense, so that if in

8

fact he commits a battery by putting the shackle on, it is

9

a defense to say I was acting according to law, period.

10

But if it turns out he was wrong that in fact there are

11

too many shackles, it's a battery.

12

MR. RAY:

13

QUESTION:

14
15
16

And no qualified immunity defense

under State law, you say.
QUESTION:

Not for the private person but for

the public.

17

MR. RAY:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. RAY:

20

there, Your Honor.

21

He must pay the piper.

QUESTION:

No, sir.

Not for the private person.

And no good faith defense?
Oh, the good faith defense would be

Now, for the public person, yes.

The

22

question is whether for the private person, if it's not

23

available to you and me in our private capacities when we

24

happen to go out as a joke and put shackles on somebody --

25

not much of a joke, but do you see what I'm driving at?

MR. RAY:

1

I see what you're driving at, Justice

2

Breyer, and I still believe that as you've stated your

3

question the good faith defense would be available to that

4

private correctional officer but not in the context of

5

having any sort of immunity.

6

It would just be a common law defense to -- I

7

acted in good -- just as if a private security guard at

8

Wal-Mart took someone into custody thinking they were a

9

shoplifter and they turned out not to be a shoplifter,

10

then they're subject to malicious prose -QUESTION:

11

I mean, I don't know if you want to

12

comment on this, but where I'm having trouble with this

13

case, and why I find it difficult, is because there are

14

three interrelated things:

15

1983 apply in the first place when the person is private,

16

b) to what extent is there ordinary tort law immunity,

17

same or different from a private person, and 3) how do we

18

fit into those answers this question here about whether

19

there's an immunity?

20

you to

a) to what extent does the

If that's too general and vague for

21

MR. RAY:

QUESTION:

1

section 1983 because we do perform those core governmental

2

functions that historically and traditionally have been

3

the police powers of the State, so I think it's not

4

questioned by anyone, at least not by us, that we are

5

amenable to suit under 1983.

6

Now then, the second question becomes, what

7

common law immunity do we have as a private person?

8

would submit that by contract the State of Tennessee

9

denied us sovereign immunity so we are in a different

10

position than our public counterparts, who are

11

correctional officers.

12

QUESTION:

Well, you just say that liability

13

under section 1983 ought to go hand-in-hand with a

14

qualified immunity defense.

15

MR. RAY:

I

Justice O'Connor, I think that that

16

would be the common-sensical approach, and I recognize

17

that Wyatt v. Cole was out there I think on the cutting

18

edge of 1983 jurisprudence in that the Court found that

19

there was color of law and amenable to suit because they

20

utilized the replevin and garnishment statutes and went on

21

to find that, because they were two cattle barons in a, if

22

you will, spite suit, that qualified immunity didn't

23

attach, and I don't disagree with that.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, it has some relevance, though,

here, and the question is, are we just going to apply that

notion in this context?
MR. RAY:

I would submit, Justice O'Connor, that

3

where a private actor is acting under the color of law,

4

amenable to suit under

5

they are performing a core governmental function that

6

traditionally and historically has been part of the police

7

power of the State, that the reasonable approach would be

8

to grant them qualified immunity.

9
10

QUESTION:

Why isn't it reasonable to say, look,

this is an extraordinary exception, that you hurt somebody
and you're not liable.

12

983, coupled with the fact that

You have this qualified immunity.

We want to limit it to those functions that are really

3

core Government functions, and it doesn't seem to us that

4

regardless of whether it used to be a core Government

5

function, the Government isn't that serious about the

6

function if it's willing to farm it out.

7

Why,

just as a means of keeping the Governments

8

honest, don't we say,

if you're really serious that this

9

is core Government functions, you want this qualified

20

immunity, you have to have your own people doing it.

21

can't farm it out to private individuals.

22

You

If you're that concerned about it, you'd

23

exercise master-servant supervision over what's going on.

24

This State hasn't,

25

why should we give qualified immunity?

so the State doesn't care that much,

Justice Scalia, I beg to differ.

Facility.
QUESTION:

6

The

The State has on-site a

Yes, but I don't want to have to look

7

into this on a case-by-case basis.

I mean, we're talking

8

about a general rule of law, and why shouldn't the general

9

rule of law be, look, if you're as much in control of it

10

that it's your own servants who are doing the thing, then

11

we'll consider qualified immunity, but if you're

12

insouciant enough to farm it out, whatever controls you

13

put, we're not going to give qualified immunity.
MR. RAY:

14

Justice Scalia, I submit that the

15

jurisprudence of this Court has always been that the

16

States are free, as the hothouses of democracy, the

17

laboratories of democracy, if you will, to attempt to

18

chart their own course in how they delegate the duties,

19

how they go about doing what they want to do.
If the State of Tennessee thinks it better

20
21

serves its citizens to contract out the running of the

22

prisons, then that is an issue that's left to the State of

23

Tennessee.

24
25

Now, whether this Court wants to decide an
immunity question on that basis I would submit that that's

clearly antithetical to what this Court's done in the

5

I wasn't talking about a private

I was talking about, it's -- the State has been

very well, so the State decides it, not parents paying

9

10

replace its own operation with a contracting-out

arrangement.

12

MR. RAY:

Well, again, I think it would be

13

dependent upon the amount of discretion that the officers

utilized in furthering the public good and what this

be my belief that in the example you've given, Justice

interested in this private part, because pure tort law, if

it does apply to this private person like any other

MR. VLADECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a damage action brought pursuant to

8

section 1983, and that provision broadly imposes liability

9

on any and every person who, acting under the color of

10

State law, deprives a person of constitutional rights.

11

contains no explicit immunities or exceptions.

12

And nonetheless, this Court has recognized that

13

when Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act back in 1871,

14

it did not intend to abrogate wholesale the immunities

15

that existed at that time.

16

It

Rather, this Court has said, and it has said it

17

as recently as Wyatt v. Cole, that it will recognize

18

immunities where, but only where, two conditions are met.

19

First, that there is some firm historical antecedent for

20

the immunity, and second that there are strong policy

21

considerations consistent with the purpose of section 1983

22

that preserve the preservation of the immunity, and both

23

conditions need be met.

not a prosecutor but a public defendant, and this Court,

relying both on history and public policy grounds, held

that that -- that person was not entitled to the immunity

that was sought in that case.

6

QUESTION:

7

in this country the judges will lose their immunity, too.
MR. VLADECK:

8

9

So if we have a lay magistrate system

Well, Your Honor, judicial

immunity is a different branch of sovereign immunity than

10

the immunity that we're speaking of here today, and that

11

gets back to my fundamental point, which is that there is

2

no historical antecedent for immunity at common law for

3

nongovernmental actors, particularly in torts involving

the abuse of Government power.

in Tower v. Glover.

2

QUESTION:

In fact, even in England,

isn't it

3

true that the hue and cry that was raised to chase the

fleeing felon often enlisted the help of all sorts of

5

private citizens in performing police functions in

6

apprehending fleeing felons?
MR. VLADECK:

7

I think that is very different.

8

do not know whether those parties had immunity.

9

historical evidence we have here is in the brief of the

I

The only

10

ACLU, which looks at the practice that existed in the turn

11

of the century for privatized prisons.
Private prisons were common in the late 1800's,

and there are cases from that time involving private

14

jailers who engaged in tortious conduct and they are not

afforded immunity.

10

MR. VLADECK:

11

QUESTION:

12

Well --

So the existence of suits doesn't

MR. VLADECK:

The question that this Court

has looked to in every single case involving the question

of whether an individual is entitled to immunity has

looked first at the question of is there historical

antecedent, and the burden on showing historical

8

antecedent has always been placed on the proponents of the

9

immunity.

20

This Court has ruled again and again that

21

because immunities interfere with the enforcement of

22

constitutional rights, the burden is on the proponent to

23

explain both the historical basis and public policy

24

arguments that support it.

this -QUESTION:

3

The courts that have looked at

Sure they have.

Their historical

4

antecedent is, their argument goes like this.

5

is the function.

6

for this person performing this function to be given

immunity.

What counts

There is plenty of historical antecedent

It's plenty.
And your response is, well, performing the same

function, but he wasn't employed by the State, and I -- it

10

seems to me that's a good rebuttal argument, but I don't

11

think you can say that they haven't brought forward any

12

historical antecedent.

13

MR. VLADECK:

Well, it is true that in common

14

law Government prison guards had immunity, or had a

15

defense that is now called an immunity, but there were --

16

there was quite an extensive experience with private

17

prisons, and there is no evidence that any of those actors

18

were ever accorded immunity either in our jurisprudence or

19

in the English jurisprudence.

20

And to the extent that people have looked at it,

21

the cases that exist -- and I agree, they're not perfect

22

on this, but do not accord private actors immunity.

23

But in any event, the policy considerations that

24

I think are germane here argue very strongly against

25

giving governmental immunity to private actors.

Our main

1

reason is this.

Placing governmental power in the hands

2

of private actors is bound to increase the risk of

3

constitutional torts, and I say that because the key

4

constraints -- qualified immunity is a tradeoff.
On one hand we accept the fact that there will

be unremedied and undeterred violations of law because we

7

find it necessary for Government to perform those

functions.

9

are transforming Government power to private actors who

It is an altogether different matter when we

10

may operate in very different ways with very different

11

incentives.
For example, here, the prison is being run by a

12

13

for-profit corporation.

14

including prison corporations, have a duty to maximize

their profits.

QUESTION:

Well, don't they also have a very

strong motive to avoid paying a lot of damages?

18

MR. VLADECK:

Well, they have a motive to avoid

paying damages if there's something in place to keep that

20

motivation present.

21

is it removes the deterrence to do precisely that, Your

Honor.

But boy, when money's at stake, they get busy --

They always blame somebody else.

MR. VLADECK:

Well, the easiest way --

-- and therefore they will really hew

6

the line.

7

and therefore, whatever reason we have for giving

8

qualified immunity to private -- to public officials,

9

we'll just apply the same there.

10

They will -- they don't want these judgments,

I mean, why does the fact that they make money

11

mean they're more likely to violate people's rights?

12

could as easily argue it's less likely.

MR. VLADECK:

QUESTION:

15

just don't see that it's more.

It is for two reasons.

I'm not saying it is less likely.

MR. VLADECK:

I

Well, my first answer, Justice

17

Breyer, is, if we don't know the answer to that question,

18

then the decision should be made by Congress, not this

19

Court, because unless it is clear that the risks of

20

conferring qualified immunity are not substantial and will

21

not do violence to the policies in 1983, this Court has

22

always said we ought not to proceed.

Why doesn't it -- look.

have an insurance policy, which would put terrifically

2

accurate incentives on public officials, but that isn't

3

our system.

We have qualified immunity.

4

So if our system is qualified immunity, it must

5

be because we want the people performing this function to

6

feel not totally worried that they're right at the line.

7

If that's the reason, why doesn't that reason apply here

8

with equal force?

9

MR. VLADECK:

Because the Court has said, in

10

cases like Harlow, that in addition to whatever economic

11

incentives that you're basing your question on, there are

12

other constraints that operate on public officials that

13

certainly are absent here.

14

QUESTION:

Like what?

15

MR. VLADECK:

is the wrong way to go about enforcing compliance with the

MR. VLADECK:

that one of the principal goals of section 1983 is to

deter civil rights violations.

That's why -- part of the reason why it was

enacted, and it seems to me that if you put governmental

6

power in the hands of private actors who are not subject

7

to the constraints that we normally think inhibit

unconstitutional acts by Government officials, that is a

very risky proposition that counsels against extending

qualified immunity to private persons here.

Do you agree with the Solicitor

General on how you treat the doctors who have a contract

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

3

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT
MR. KNEEDLER:

4
5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
It is the position of the United States that

6

7

guards employed by a private corporation that is operating

8

a prison pursuant to a contract with the State for the

9

operation of that prison are not entitled to invoke

10

qualified immunity under section 1983 solely by virtue of

11

the fact that they are performing functions that are

12

similar to those performed by a publicly employed guard.

13

However, as we explain in our brief, there are other

14

circumstances not present in this case in which we do

15

believe that private persons should be entitled to invoke

16

immunity.

17

some of them in fact have distinct common law antecedents.

Some of those have been referred to here, and

18

There are -- there's a common law recognition,

19

for example, for private judicial activities in the area

20

of arbitration.

1

cannot get the assistance of private persons in the

2

performance of public functions, the law has long

3

recognized immunities or defenses, and we think in those

4

circumstances that correspondingly under 1983, or Bivens,

5

when a person is acting under color of law, that there

6

would be also a basis for doing that.

7

QUESTION:

Do we know that that isn't one of

8

those situations?

That is to say, do we know that private

9

companies, deep pockets, apparently, do not have the

10

sovereign immunity that the State has and who are liable,

11

you know, for vicarious master-servant liability for their

12

individual functionaries, is it clear that they would take

13

on these contracts and perform that governmental function

14

if, indeed, they didn't have comparable qualified immunity

15

to the one that the Government's own prison guards --

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think there are really two

17

questions, and that is whether the private corporation

18

would be able to attract employees to serve as their

19

guards, but then beyond that the question would be whether

20

the State could accomplish the function of housing

21

prisoners if that weren't so.

22

And we know from history that the States have

23

operated prisons themselves and have been able to hire

24

employees and attract employees and give them the security

25

of their job.

In fact, that's one of the functions of

2

qualified immunity in the public sector.
QUESTION:

If that's true, then -- you're not

3

going to know the answer to this either, I bet, because I

4

bet there is no answer, but try it, but my impression, the

5

qualified immunity thing, it's a creation by this Court

6

interpreting a statute that rests upon common law tort

7

law, and the kinds of immunity that under common law tort

8

law went with public officials.

9

So if we're going back to history I would be

10

quite interested as to how the States, again, have applied

11

their common law tort law to people who suddenly

12

privatize, take over State functions.

13

If, for example, they were to say, no, there is

14

no immunity, you're treated just like Joe Blokes out in

15

the street, that would support your historical argument

16

very much, because then they would have evolved tort law

17

the same way, and the opposite would be the opposite, and

18

you're going to tell me you don't know because it probably

19

hasn't come up yet.

20
21

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, my understanding is that that

is, that that distinction does exist in tort law.

22

QUESTION:

All right.

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

So what happens?

For Government officials -- and

24

this is really the issue in this Court's decision in

Federal employees from State common law torts.
The Court there referred to the fact that at

2

3

common law employees were absolutely immune, essentially

4

for acts performed within the scope of their discretion,

5

and the Restatement of Torts refers to that same immunity

6

for public officials acting within the scope of their

7

discretion.

9
10

There is no comparable immunity as such for

QUESTION:

No, but now what happens when --

exactly right --

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

-- for private persons.

12

Now, I'm not aware of any law dealing

13

specifically with contracting out, but I see no reason why

14

contracts awarded to a private corporation for service

15

contracts in this case, or procurement contracts, either

16

way I see no reason why a private corporation in its

17

ordinary functions, whether it's performing a contract for

18

another private person or the Government, would not be

19

subject to the -- as a general rule, the same rule, that

20

there would not be a comparable immunity.

21

Now, there may be defenses at common law, and

22

for example, there are privileges or defenses -- these

23

things had different labels at common law for -- and I'm

24

sure the guards here would have a defense, even a private

25

person would, in assisting in an arrest, and I'm sure that

1

there would be a good faith defense recognized at common

2

law in Tennessee -- not an immunity, but a defense in

3

terms of the force that was reasonably believed to be

4

necessary by a guard to restrain someone.

5

That would be a privileged battery, and the

6

question would be whether the battery would be -- was

7

reasonable.

QUESTION:

8

9

But -Mr. Kneedler, you've confused me now.

I thought when you began you acknowledged that there were

10

some instances in which qualified immunity was given to

11

private people where you said it was necessary to call for

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

15

Right.

Now you're just -- I thought you're

just saying now that there aren't any instances.
MR. KNEEDLER:

16

No, no.

I was explaining the

17

general common law rule of torts that the absolute

18

immunity for Government actors did not apply in the

19

20

were --

1

law to support a distinction between people who are public

2

employees and people who are employees of private

3

corporations, but even under contracts, I do want to make

4

one important point.

5

If a person operating under a contract is acting

6

pursuant to a specific governmental directive, either in

7

the contract that something shall be done in a certain

8

way, or directives in a particular case that something

9

shall be done in a certain way, we believe that qualified

10

immunity should attach to that, because in that situation

11

it is not the private actor but the government that is

12

really accountable for that, and the Government agent or

13

official who made that decision has been responsible for

14

balancing the costs and benefits of doing that.

15

I do think that there is an important

16

distinction, both as a matter of history, constitutional

17

law, and common sense, between Government and private

18

corporations, between the Government way of doing things,

19

or the Government model, and the private market model.

20

For one thing, Article VI of the Constitution

21

requires every executive officer of a State, of the State

22

or Federal Government to take an oath to support the

23

Constitution, and those heads of executive departments,

24

including the State correctional department, have direct

25

responsibility and political accountability for those who

In that climate it is -- I think the courts have

3

been willing to assume the regularity of governmental

4

operations.

any event they will be subject to direct political

accountability.

That's not to say that the -QUESTION:

prisoners than if they were Government employees?

there wouldn't be less media

hold the public warden or correctional superintendent more

21

directly responsible for what happened, and perhaps

22

properly so.

responsibility of the head of the correctional department.

2

The Government has turned over as a package the entire

operation of the prison, and there are a series of

4

financial and other incentives for the contractor to both

rights.

That includes not just what happens in

Right.

I'm not saying that

19

there's no responsibility, but we do believe that it's

individual doctors who may be integrated into what's

operation of an entire institution to a private

2

corporation.

3

The model, then, would be that that private

4

corporation, using whatever it believes would best promote

5

the overall performance of the contract, to use its

6

creativity, to use its financial resources in a way that

7

will both win the contract the next time around and also

8

to guard against constitutional rights, and the Government

9

-- I think this Court has been willing to assume that the

10

accountability and the direct responsibility of the

11

Constitution will help to deter constitutional violations.

12

I think that there's less structural basis --

13

I'm not saying necessarily empirical, but structural basis

14

for concluding that the same assumption should not be

15

applied in the case of private contractors, but we do urge

16

this Court not to announce a rule that would say that

17

immunity is not available in any case of private actors,

we're going to have qualified immunity for these types of

15

people, the people who utilize the most discretion on a

16

day-to-day basis and need it the most are correctional

17

officials.

18

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

It's probably

19

not a very great point, because nobody's made it on the

20

other side, but this did occur to me.

21

this incentive thing, which we've been through, but if you

22

go back into the history of these cases, I once thought

23

that the reason this qualified immunity developed at all

24

was the courts are focusing on a particular person who may

25

not have insurance.

They mostly argued

He's a defendant, and they're saying this poor

1

2

person, you know, he's trying to do his job, here his life

3

is ruined, he's stuck with $ 00,000 verdict -- we'll hurt

4

the plaintiffs a little bit in order to help him out a

5

little bit.

6

Now, if that was how this thing developed -- and

7

certainly Learned Hand probably had something like that in

8

mind, I think, in Gregoire v. Biddle, all right -- then it

9

is a different world, isn't it, where people have

10

insurance?

11

MR. RAY:

12

QUESTION:

No question about it.
And if we're going into this

3

different world when people have insurance, like the

4

private companies all must under contract, then that

5

defendant is somewhat less in need of that protection, and

6

that -- though no one's made this, so maybe there's some

7

obvious answer to this, but the -- if they don't need the

8

protection because we're now in a new world, does that

9

sort of hurt the whole idea of qualified immunity, at

20

least as applied to a field where they have to have

21

insurance?

22

MR. RAY:

In the case that was argued yesterday

23

it was quite apparent that insurance played a great role

24

in that particular case.

25

whether or not it was enough.

The county had insurance,
So governments indemnify

1

their employees just as private concerns do, and I don't

2

believe that this Court has ever let that particular issue

3

decide whether qualified immunity would pass on to a

4

certain governmental official.

5

And again, since Harlow, the focus I would

6

submit has been upon what the public interest is in having

7

qualified immunity conferred on this particular

8

governmental official, who utilizes discretion on a daily

9

basis.

10

We do indemnify our guards, but eventually that

11

cost is going to be passed on to the State of Tennessee,

12

and eventually passed on to the taxpayers of the State of

13

Tennessee, so I would submit that the ultimate

14

serve the taxpayers of the State of Tennessee, and

15

therefore qualified immunity shouldn't turn on whether or

16

not there's indemnification of our employees.

17

QUESTION:

goal is to

Well, I don't know if that's the

18

ultimate goal.

The statute is -- was enacted to protect

19

the constitutional rights of people from violation by

20

State officials, and in your hypothesis, you've got a

21

constitutional violation here, but it should go

22

unredressed because of the qualified immunity doctrine.

23

MR. RAY:

24

our policy at all.

QUESTION:

No, Mr. Justice Stevens, that's not

1

there's a constitutional violation.
MR. RAY:

2

Well, if our actions were objectively

3

reasonable under the standard established by this Court,

4

then qualified immunity attaches to it.
QUESTION:

5
6

Qualified immunity attaches even

though there was a constitutional violation.
MR. RAY:

7

But again, as I understand it, Mr.

8

Richardson and Mr. Walker did not know or should not have

9

known about their constitutional deprivation of

10

Mr. McKnight's rights in order for them to have the

11

benefit.
But one thing I do want to point out, one of the

12

16

reasons -QUESTION:

I thought you said that was just down

the road, when we opened this discussion.
MR. RAY:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

17

That question has not been decided by the district court,

18

the Sixth Circuit, and we never got that far.

19

But in response to one of Mr. Justice Breyer's

20

questions earlier, one of the specific reasons that we can

21

lose this contract is to violate the constitutional rights

22

of the inmates that we have in our keep, and that is quite

23

evident to all our employees, and if we want to succeed

24

and retain this contract, then we have to proceed down a

25

straight and narrow path that belies the parade of

horribles that the respondent and amici have raised.
QUESTION:

2

The contract says that in so many

3

words, don't violate the constitutional rights of any

4

prisoners, or just -- it says that?

MR. RAY:

That's one of the provisions, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

one of them, Mr. Justice Souter.

QUESTION:

Is that clause subject to the

qualified immunity defense?

defense against a tort suit but you lose the contract

16

because you've violated their constitutional rights,

qualified immunity or not.

MR. RAY:

You may end up having a

That's a real box you're in.

I'm assuming -- I've been known to put

myself in such a box at 2:00 a.m. in the morning when I
