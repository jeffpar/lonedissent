CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

:05 a.m.)

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 95- 62 , Harbor Tug & Barge Company v. John

5

Papai.

Mr. Danoff.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC DANOFF

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. DANOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case presents two distinct legal issues.

12

The first is whether an injured maritime worker who has

3

received LHWCA, Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation

4

Act benefits pursuant to an award by an administrative law

5

judge can thereafter seek seaman's remedies or whether

6

that person is precluded.

7

The second issue is whether an injured maritime

8

worker's status as a seaman or not is dependent upon his

9

job assignment at the time when he is injured or can be

20

dependent upon his prior work history for other employers

21

or for the same employer.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Danoff, as a preliminary

23

question, if the Court were to address the second question

24

and conclude that we do not look at the prior relationship

25

with other tug owner employers but confine the fleet

principle to the same owner of the vessels being worked

2

on, if we were to do that, do we have to reach the first

3

question, or would that become advisory?

4

would happen if we were to decide the second issue in your

5

favor?
MR. DANOFF:

6

I mean, what

The case could be decided on either

7

one of the two questions in our favor and that could end

8

the case.

9

QUESTION:

And should it end the case?

I mean,

10

do we have any business offering alternative holdings, or

11

not?
MR. DANOFF:

12

I think in this case yes, and the

13

reason is that there is a significant and clear split in

14

the circuits on both issues.

15

QUESTION:

Well, there's a split on both, but

16

answering both might make something advisory, it seems to

17

me.

18

MR. DANOFF:

I think it would not be -- if the

19

decision were made on both issues, as I think it should

20

be, it would eliminate the problems we have raised in the

21

brief with duplicative litigation in the case of each

22

issue, and it would resolve the split in the circuits in

23

each issue.

24
25

The case could be decided on narrow grounds, but
I don't think it has to be decided on narrow grounds.

important issue - -

3

MR. DANOFF:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. DANOFF:

6

Which of the two is the more

I --- to those who are in the field?
Well, it's actually somewhat

different fields.

7

I think people who are in purely deep water, or

8

seaman issues, the second issue would be more important.

9

To those who are involved in administration of LHWCA and

10

paying benefits under the LHWCA, the first issue is more

11

important.

12

I think they're equally important to different

13

segments of the industry, and to some extent to a group

14

that it overlaps for, so I do think it is important to

15

resolve both issues.

16

The preclusion issue, the first issue involving

17

the benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Workers

18

Compensation Act, I wanted to underscore the difference

19

between this case and the Gizoni case which was argued

20

strenuously by the other side.

21

In the Gizoni case, the worker who had been

22

injured had not received any sort of compensation order,

23

whether by an administrative law judge or by a section

24

8(i) settlement or by the district director.

25

simply receiving benefits essentially voluntarily, at the

He was

1

same time seeking seaman status.
The difference between that case and this one is

2

3

that in this case there is a compensation order, and that

4

triggers section

5

Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation Act, which talks

6

about the employer's liability is exclusive under the act,

7

and the issue is what makes the employer liable?

8

case of the LHWCA, it's a compensation order, whether it's

05(a), which talks of -- of the

10

case.

11

In this case, there --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Danoff, would you explain to

13

me - - I know you have a literal interpretation of

14

but standing back from that, you mentioned the Gizoni

15

case.

16

the Longshore Act would be amenable to a later Jones Act

17

case.

18

05(a),

That says the employer who pays voluntarily under

On the other hand, if the employer says, not a

1

penny until you drag me before some forum, they go into

20

the Workers Compensation, the Longshore mold because it's

21

the fastest, and in that case you would say there can't be

22

any Jones Act, but in the other case where the employer

23

was much more solicitous of the employee there could be?

24

What sense would that make?

25

MR. DANOFF:

Well, the employer would not always

1

get protection if it voluntarily paid, that's true.

2

the other hand, from the employer's point of view they

3

have - - if they feel that the Jones Act suit is

4

inappropriate, that status needs to be determined, they

5

would have to object because the worker is seeking seaman

6

status in the Department of Labor forum, and at that point

7

get an adjudication of status.
Sooner or later there has to be an adjudication

of status.

It may be some employer -QUESTION:

10

Yes, but you know, the big problem as

11

I see it here is that provision in title 33 section

12

903(e).

13

Harbor Workers Act.

Now, I guess that's in the Longshoreman and

14

MR. DANOFF:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
And it says, notwithstanding any

16

other provision of law any amounts paid to an employee for

17

the same injury, disability, or death for which benefits

18

are claimed under this chapter, the longshoreman workers

19

case, pursuant to the Jones Act, seaman act case, shall be

20

credited against any liability imposed by this chapter.

21

Now, this Court expressed some reliance on that

22

section in Gizoni, and presumably it's a section to which

23

we have to give some effect, and I don't know how it would

24

apply under your proposed rule.

25

of this section?

As opposed to - So you would confine that section

only to the voluntary payment of benefits?
MR. DANOFF:

To the voluntary payment of a Jones

17

Act settlement or to payments of State Workers

18

Compensation.

19

I think it would be very - - a very strained

20

reading to take 903(e), which doesn't say anything about

21

exclusive liability of the employer, who has been

22

adjudicated to have to pay under the LHWCA, and say 903(e)

23

retracted that immunity without any statement in 903(e)

24

that it is intending to retract that immunity and without

any legislative history -8

But what
-- saying that.
What about the court's reliance on

the section in Gizoni?
MR. DANOFF:

Well, in Gizoni again there was no

adjudication yet of the individual's status and therefore

section 905(a) never came into play.

QUESTION:

Here, the injured worker presumably

went to a Longshoreman and Harbor Workers administrative

judge and asserted that he was in fact a Longshoreman and

QUESTION:

MR. DANOFF:

Well, it wasn't on appeal.

The

case had not been concluded because he still had a 905(b)

action.

12

the 905(b) action had not taken place, and was about to

MR. DANOFF:

QUESTION:

He could have ultimately appealed,

words, I assume there's no provision in there that the

mere filing of a claim under the harbor workers act

obligates the employer to start making payments pending an

ultimate adjudication of liability.

MR. DANOFF:

In other

If the employer controverts the

duty to pay, he is not obligated --

QUESTION:

MR. DANOFF:

-- to pay pending the adjudication.

10

There are penalties if he is wrong, but yes, there could

11

be a period where the worker is not receiving longshore

12

benefits, but if, in fact, he is a seaman, that just puts

13

him in the same position as all other seamen and all other

14

tort victims.

15

QUESTION:

If it had gone the other way before

16

the ALJ -- suppose the ALJ said, I find this person's a

sailor, would that be issue preclusive in the district

court litigation?

MR. DANOFF:

I believe it would be.

I think

20

it's not you know, in question necessarily in this case,

21

but I think as a matter of logic it would be.

QUESTION:

Even though -- in this very scenario,

sailor, and doesn't contest that, comes back to the

2

district court and says, see, now I've got a final

3

adjudication that I'm not entitled to longshore benefits

4

because I'm a sailor, and you say the district court then,

5

despite the district court's earlier ruling, would -- that

6

it would be issue preclusive --

7

MR. DANOFF:

Because it was an interlocutory

8

ruling and the first final ruling on status is the one

9

that should govern.

10

QUESTION:

Do the administrative law judges

11

routinely say, you are a sailor, or do they just say that

12

you are or you are not a longshore worker?

13

MR. DANOFF:

Technically it's the latter, but if

14

the only issue is, are you a seaman or are you a longshore

15

worker, ALJ's will from time to time say we find he is not

16

a longshore worker he is a seaman.

QUESTION:

Well, there could be some instances,

18

or could they, correct me if I'm wrong, where you're

Okay.

If that is the only thing that

the court is technically empowered to decide, if that is

respect to what is necessary for the judgment in the first

MR. DANOFF:

And that will be a question I'm

sure some day the Court will have to address.

Namely,

10

when the Court has said repeatedly that the two acts are

11

mutually exclusive, if somebody gets an award under the

12

Jones Act, for instance, first, is that mutually exclusive

13

of the Longshore Act.

14

In the case of this case, where the first action

15

is under the Longshore Act, the statute itself says the

16

employer's liability is exclusive in law or at admiralty.

17

I don't know what that could mean, other than there's no

18

Jones Act remedy allowed to follow.

contradicting that.

QUESTION:

I don't follow --

4

QUESTION:

Are you getting into this as an

5

alternative basis for affirmance of the Ninth Circuit?

6

The Ninth Circuit said the question before us is whether

7

the plaintiff's receipt of compensation benefits under the

8

LHWCA precludes him from also recovering as a seaman under
the Jones, but he took it as a given that that had

10

happened, and they don't go into this thing you're talking

11

about at all.

12

findings as we receive them.

We ordinarily take the Ninth Circuit's

MR. BOYLE:

13

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The only

14

reason I got into this is because there was a lot of

15

colloquy during Mr. Danoff's argument about people being

16

seamen, being longshoreman, and being neither, and that's

17

the only reason why I brought this up.
QUESTION:

18

That's all.

Can I ask about the main collateral

1

estoppel issue, something that's bothering me that I don't

20

see answered.

21

in your opinion, if the injured employee goes to the

22

longshoreman people first and they say you're a

23

longshoreman, then the person should be able to sue under

24

the Jones Act and say, no, I'm a seaman, and that doesn't

25

bind me.

Maybe there's an obvious answer to it.

Right?

MR. BOYLE:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
Okay.

What happens in your opinion

3

if the first -- if what happens is that he wants to -- is

4

the employer bound similarly, or not bound similarly?

5

In other words, what happens if they say in the

6

first proceeding you're not a longshoreman, you're a

7

seaman, and then the injured person goes into court and

8

the employer who just won says, oh, no, you're not a
seaman, you're a longshoreman, and then the man ends up

10

with nothing?

11

MR. BOYLE:

12

QUESTION:

Well -Because the court says he's a

13

longshoreman and the ALJ said he's a seaman, and there he

14

is, not a penny.

15

it possible that the employer would be bound but the

16

employee wouldn't?

17

this whole thing work out?

18

So how is this supposed to work, or is

MR. BOYLE:

That doesn't seem very fair.

How does

Well, the way it works out is that

1

if the employer went before - - in front of the ALJ and

20

vigorously argued that the worker was a seaman, regardless

21

of what the ALJ decided, the arguments, the conduct

22

advanced by that litigant in front of the ALJ, principles

23

of equitable estoppel would prevent the employer from

24

going in front of the district judge and taking an

25

opposite position.

2

Well then, why wouldn't it equally

bind the employee?

3

MR. BOYLE:

Well, because in this case and in

all of these cases you never have an employee go in and

5

vigorously argue that they're a longshoreman.
QUESTION:

7

Will we measure the vigor of the

argument in determining collateral estoppel?
MR. BOYLE:

Well, to the extent that one of the

guidelines of the Astoria Savings case versus Solimino is
10

the incentive to vigorously or aggressively pursue a

11

position.

12

Now, there are five things about this ALJ

13

determination and ALJ awards of longshore benefits that

14

indicate that they are not entitled to administrative

collateral estoppel, and the first of those was mentioned

in Mr. Danoff's argument, is in the statute itself, the

But isn't it also true, just to throw

MR. BOYLE:

Well, the problem with that is that

2

back in 1920 there were no Worker's Compensation laws, and

3

back in 1927, in 1920 when the Jones Act was enacted, it

4

was designed to give itinerant seamen a cause of action to

5

be tried by a jury against their employer.

QUESTION:

Well, there were certainly lots of

7

Workman's Compensation laws in 1920, State Worker's

8

Compensation.

11

MR. BOYLE:

But the Congress decided that seamen

would not be covered by State Worker's Comp.
QUESTION:

Well, that may be one thing, but I

12

thought you said there weren't any Workman's Compensation

13

laws in 1920.

14

That simply is factually inaccurate.

MR. BOYLE:

Well, there was no Federal Worker's

15

Compensation law in 1920, and what I was getting at is the

16

purpose of the Jones Act, and this is the fifth reason, is

17

to afford seamen a trial by jury -- crew members, really,

18

is what seamen are -- a trial by jury of the issue not

19

only of negligence but of their status.

20

And in that trial by jury, after you have a

21

prima facie case established, which I believe we did in

22

this case under Chandris v. Latsis, which was that the

23

worker had contributed to the function and mission of the

24

vessel, and that he had a connection with the vessel which

25

was substantial in both duration and in nature, then that

An ALJ is not

8

Now, there's four things about this particular

9

ALJ determination that in itself makes it nonpreclusive,

10

and the second one of that is the laches that this

11

defendant, this petitioner, after believing that Sharp

12

governed this case, after believing that it would be

13

preclusive, did not bring it to the attention of the

14

district judge, but waited until we got to the court of

15

appeals.

16

That's laches.

That prevents preclusion.

And the fourth one is, if this Court decides to

follow Sharp, this is a change in the law from back in

The Jones Act

Yes.

That's your brief.

And I take it it

is also your position that it does nor bind the employer.
MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Breyer, the answer to

14

your question is that the Government's position is that an

15

ALJ determination in a longshore award is not binding and

16

does not have preclusive effect on a subsequent Jones Act

17

suit brought by the employee.

the second part of my

In the most likely scenario, the district court

MR. FREDERICK:

That would make

I don't -- respectfully, I

4

think, Justice Souter, the way the credit provision is

worded by saying liability imposed, if you accepted

There wouldn't be

I know you're at

the end of the time, but I've had no opportunity to ask

5

about it, to clarify, please, the point you tried to

address previously for Justice Breyer.

7

Apparently you think that an employer could be

be equitably estopped and can take inconsistent positions.

And the employer says, no you

You were, if anything, a longshoreman.
MR. FREDERICK:

11

That's correct.

And what has happened here,

12

Justice O'Connor, is that instead of paying maintenance

13

and cure, which under the boatman's agreement for deck

14

hands in this case, the petitioner here did not pay

15

maintenance and cure, which would be the traditional

16

seaman's remedy, and now under petitioner's theory would

have the leverage to say, I'm not going to pay you

voluntary benefits under the Longshore Act either, and so

the question of hardship really does arise for the injured

worker.
