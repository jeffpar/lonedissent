ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY K. WILKINSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

11

MR. WILKINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises from the Ninth Circuit and

12

raises the question whether farmers and irrigation

13

districts that receive water pursuant to Federal contracts

14

have standing to complain when their water supplies are

15

cut, their crops threatened, and their land devalued as a

16

consequence of Government conduct alleged to violate the

17

provisions of the Endangered Species Act.

18

QUESTION:

We're talking about the granting of a

19

motion to dismiss here, aren't we?

20

MR. WILKINSON:

21

QUESTION:

22

23
24
25

That's correct.

So, we're talking about the -- how

you construe allegations in a complaint basically.
MR. WILKINSON:

In part, that's -- yes,

absolutely correct.
According to the Ninth Circuit, the answer to

1

the question I posed is no because petitioners'

2

competitive, economic-based interest in the water places

3

them outside a zone of interest protected by the ESA.

4

We believe this ruling goes well beyond the

5

bounds of any standing decision of this Court, and

6

notably, neither the Government nor any amicus attempts to

7

defend it.

8

actions commenced under the citizen suit provision of the

9

ESA, they are more than satisfied by the petitioners in

If prudential considerations apply at all to

10

this case.

Their water supply contracts and the claims

11

they alleged in their complaint place them well within any

12

zone of interest either protected or regulated by the ESA
And for the same reason, petitioners also have a

13
14

right to review under the Administrative Procedure Act

15

since they are persons adversely affected or aggrieved

16

within the meaning of the relevant statute, namely, the

17

ESA.

18

Finally, unless the ruling of the Ninth circuit

19

is reversed, we believe there will be at least three far-

20

reaching and negative effects from it.

21

First, there will exist a prudential standing

22

scheme under the ESA that overtly discriminates against

23

economically based plaintiffs.

24
25

Second, because the courthouse doors will be
closed to everyone except environmental plaintiffs, there

1
2

will be one-sided enforcement of the ESA.
Finally,

the result of that one-sided

3

enforcement we believe will be skewed implementation of

4

the act that continually presses the Government forward to

5

a position of over-regulation instead of the balance

6

sought by Congress when it has committed the act.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WILKINSON:

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilkinson -Yes, Your Honor.

-- the Solicitor General in response

10

apparently chooses not to address the merits, but does

11

raise an issue about whether the petitioners have Article

12

III standing and an issue about whether the claims are

13

cognizable under the statutory scheme.

14
15
16

Were those arguments raised below in response to
the motion to dismiss?
MR. WILKINSON:

Justice O'Connor, the Article

17

III arguments were raised below.

However,

they were not

You mean in response to the petition

on certiorari?
MR. WILKINSON:

That's correct, yes.

it would be our view that those

cognizability issues are not properly before you.
QUESTION:

2

3

And do we have before us today any

issue on the APA claim?

4

MR. WILKINSON:

The APA arguments as well were

5

not raised below in our view by the Government, and

6

consequently also are not properly before you today.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wilkinson, jurisdictional issues

are always properly before us.

I mean, if there is no
We can

surely reach the Article III issue if we want to.
MR. WILKINSON:

11

Oh, Justice Scalia, yes, I

12

believe you can.

13

Article III issues were not properly raised.

14

they were and I believe the Government preserved those

15

issues.

16

I'm not intending to say that the
I believe

There's a question, however, that may arise as

17

to which do you get to first:

18

the Article III issues.

19

this Court indicate that while preliminary jurisdictional

20

questions may be approached first, certainly before merits

Court which indicates which comes first.

with the prudential questions before you reach the Article

courts below.

Those were the issues that were the subject

2

for the -- of the petition of writ of certiorari and those

3

were the issues on which certiorari was granted.

4

In addition, those are the issues, the

5

prudential issues, that have split the courts of appeal,

6

and as I think we've indicated in a letter to the Court,

7

that split has only grown since cert was granted.

QUESTION:

Assuming we agree with you on the

prudential issues, would you want us to resolve the
Article III issue or remand to have -MR. WILKINSON:

We would prefer, if you are with

12

us on the prudential issues, that we are still in this

13

case, that you go forward and try and resolve the Article

III issues.

16

arise on motions to dismiss.

17

Defenders of Wildlife, at that stage of the case, the

18

burden for a petitioner attempting to deal with Article

19

III is a more modest one --

20

I think that's particularly appropriate, in

QUESTION:

And according to Lujan v.

Well, now, is the Article III

21

standing issue -- does the resolution of that depend at

22

all on who it is the petitioners sued, what agency?

23

MR. WILKINSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

We don't believe that --

Does that enter into the calculus of

the Article III standing question?

No, Your Honor, it doesn't as

I'm not sure that I fully

Well, apparently the suit below was

5

not brought against the Secretary who has the final

6

determination.

7

MR. WILKINSON:

Actually the suit below was

8

brought against the Secretary.

It was named -- Bruce

9

Babbitt was named as a defendant.

Bruce Babbitt is also,

10

apart from being the Secretary of the Interior, the

11

cabinet official responsible for both the Fish and

12

Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Reclamation.

13

struck us as somewhat curious, indeed, that the United

14

States would challenge Article III standing on the basis

15

that we had not properly joined the Bureau.

QUESTION:

The problem that's bothering me --

20

MR. WILKINSON:

Let me deal first with the

21

situation that exists in this case, and then I'll deal

22

with your hypothetical.

23

Your hypothetical is not this case, Your Honor,

24

because in this case it was alleged that the Bureau would

25

comply, that the Secretary would authorize the Bureau to

2

brief, the United States admits that the Bureau indicated

that it would comply.

hypothetical differs from this case in the sense that it

assumes non-compliance when in fact there is compliance.

Mr. Wilkinson, could you just clarify

what you mean by comply?
complied.

You said the Secretary has

Has he made an adjustment in the water level?
MR. WILKINSON:

Yes, he has, Justice Ginsburg.

12

He has, and as a consequence of that adjustment, we lost

13

80 percent of our water supply.

14

People lost their jobs.

15

hundreds of dollars per acre to $20 per acre.

Now, we didn't have an opportunity.

Lands were fallowed.

This case

17

didn't get far enough for us to raise those issues either

18

on a motion for summary judgment or a trial, but we are

19

prepared to prove every one of those allegations.

20

QUESTION:

So, you say the ripeness question is

21

something that needs to be aired in a court of first

22

instance, but that you have --

23

MR. WILKINSON:

We believe that we have

24

satisfied in this case already, on the basis of the

25

pleadings before you, the issue of ripeness.

QUESTION:

1
2

It can be contested later in more

detail I assume.

3

MR. WILKINSON:

4

QUESTION:

Certainly, and --

At the summary judgment stage and at

5

the merits stage, even more evidence can be brought in on

6

that.

7

MR. WILKINSON:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

But you're saying that at the

pleading level, you've done all that's needed at that
point.

11

MR. WILKINSON:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That's correct.

That's correct.

Yes, but you just recited some facts

that are not included in your pleading.
MR. WILKINSON:

15

raise those issues.

16

QUESTION:

We never had the opportunity to

Well, but if you want -- it just

17

seems to me if you want the issue decided on the complaint

18

as it now stands, I don't see how you can tell us facts

19

that are not in those things you say should be

20

dispositive.

21

MR. WILKINSON:

In our complaint -- it's page 40

22

of the petition appendix --we alleged that the

23

restrictions on lake levels imposed in the biological

24

opinion adversely affect plaintiffs by substantially

25

reducing the quantity of available irrigation water.

1

That's the generalized allegation of injury.
QUESTION:

2

Yes, but the Government points out

3

there's no allegation that you're going to even lose a

4

gallon of water.

5

MR. WILKINSON:

6

QUESTION:

Well --

And theoretically under your

7

pleading, all the harm could be suffered by other water

8

users.

9

MR. WILKINSON:

Well, the Government is not, I'm

10

afraid, being straight with you in terms of how this

11

project operates.

12

the case this far, but the fact is the project operates on

13

a pro rata distribution basis.

14

administered by the petitioner, the irrigation districts.

We don't know because we haven't gotten

The project is in fact

And what we've got is a situation where it

really doesn't matter in effect how the harm or the loss

of water is distributed.

result of the biological opinion that whatever amount of

19

water is bestowed by nature, whatever amount of water is

MR. WILKINSON:

are true I believe at the motion to dismiss.

QUESTION:

Well, yes, for purposes of deciding

any legal question raised by the motion to dismiss.

MR. WILKINSON:

QUESTION:

8

I was wondering if you could get back

MR. WILKINSON:

I wanted to do that, Justice

Kennedy.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WILKINSON:

13

Right.

to the hypothetical Justice Breyer posed.

9
10

In fact, you assume that they

You were interrupted.
Let me see if I can recall the

hypothetical.

14

QUESTION:

The basic thing would be that, look,

15

the APA -- and I say the statute is similar -- says that

16

you can sue to complain about final agency action, and the

17

final agency action in this instance, arguably, is not the

18

action of the Fish and Wildlife Service, but rather the

19

action, let's say, of the Bureau of Reclamation.
And whether you put this sentence in the

20
21

complaint or didn't put it in the complaint, you are not

22

suing to claim that the action of the Bureau of

23

Reclamation is unlawful.

24

about is that the action of the report sending is

25

unlawful.

What you are suing to complain

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

And therefore, I wondered if it is ripe in the

2

sense that your complaint does not attack the final agency

3

action, namely, the action of the Bureau of Reclamation

4

which would lower or raise or do something with the water.

5

That was -- and I wondered how I could go at the standing

6

question if I believed the hypothetical because standing

7

would depend on what your argument is in respect to the

8

final agency action which you would attack which this

9

complaint seems not to attack.

10
11

QUESTION:

That was --

Before you answer that, would you

incorporate please --

12

MR. WILKINSON:

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- whether in fact you're relying on

14

the APA as the source of the action or whether you can sue

15

separately under the Endangered Species Act without

16

reference to the final agency action requirement of APA.

17

MR. WILKINSON:

18

first, Justice O'Connor.

19

Let me answer your question

We believe we do have independent causes of

20

action under both the Administrative Procedure Act and the

21

citizen suit provision of the Endangered Species Act.

22

fact, 1540(g)(5) of the Endangered Species Act provides

23

for redundancy of remedy and provides that nothing in the

24

citizen suit provision will preclude a petitioner from

25

using other remedies as well.

In

intended there to be a redundancy of remedy.
Justice Breyer, in response to your question, I

believe I've answered it on the facts of this case which

4

are that the Bureau has already agreed to comply, but let

MR. WILKINSON:

My question, remember --- deal with the hypothetical as

you posed it.
QUESTION:

But you haven't sued the Bureau.

MR. WILKINSON:

11

QUESTION:

We sued --

I mean, in his question is the fact

12

that you have sued the wrong party.

14

which would affect you.

MR. WILKINSON:

The party you have

Justice Scalia, we sued Bruce

16

Babbitt, Secretary of Interior.

17

against Bruce Babbitt, who is the cabinet Secretary

18

responsible for the Bureau of Reclamation, we think as a

19

practical matter, the Bureau will not differ from a

decision which binds the Secretary.

indicate that in resolving issues of finality, you use a

doctrine of practicality.

MR. WILKINSON:

We seek to get the existing

The Secretary, the Bureau in this case, had no

possibility of doing anything other than complying with

So, in answer to your hypothetical, Justice

7

Breyer, yes, we believe that the biological opinion was

final as of the time that it was issued and that the

Bureau in fact did not really have any opportunity as a

really you're saying that these reports are like

impact statements are preliminary to final agency action,

5

And as to that, we say that there is -- the only

6

cognizable claims under the citizen suit provisions are

things for violations of the act, and as we explain in our

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, but let me also say if --

even if the citizen suit provision were applicable to

administration of the act rather than on-the-ground

And this ties

7

foundation for this citizen suit provision, was designed

to allow a right of action where that would be true under

application of it.

3

So, when you have this citizen suit provision

building on Sierra Club v. Morton, its principal thrust

was that environmental interests are a sufficient basis

for bringing a suit.

against that background, there's no suggestion that the

I have standing.

I'm hurt.

I'm

complaining about a final action, and I have a reason that

under the law was not complied with.

12

I cannot bring that action, and if not, why not?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Okay.

Now, are you saying

There are two situations

14

in which you might sue the action agency.

15

agency is -- if the Bureau of Reclamation reduced the

16

water and it might have harmed the species, there's

17

unquestionably a cause of action under the citizen suit

provision.

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

If the action

Raised the water.
If the water is raised, there's

The background of that provision

6

when it was enacted in '79 indicates that that was put in

there so that the agency would not feel it had to hold up

8

doing anything at all until it had perfect information.

9

QUESTION:

Just like the EPA.

Even though you

get a wonderful environmental report, the agency isn't

11

bound by the conclusion of that report so long as it has

been done properly.

It's free to proceed on its best

MR. KNEEDLER:

with this biological report here.

The Bureau

of Reclamation may have other evidence -QUESTION:

So, you are saying it's just like an

environmental impact statement.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

22

QUESTION:

23

That's exactly right.

Yes.

In other words, the agency must get

it before it acts, but it may totally ignore it.

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

Does that make any sense?

MR. KNEEDLER:

The sense of the act is that the

4

the biological opinion.

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Most action --

But they don't have to.
They don't, and that's our point.

They don't legally have to.

QUESTION:

9

MR. KNEEDLER:
QUESTION:

10

And in fact, they may --

But they have to get one.
They have to get one.

They have to get a good one just as

11

an agency has to get an environmental impact statement,

12

and if it hasn't gotten a good one, if it has gotten one

13

that's been done on the cheap or one that's a sham,

14

they're in violation of the act.
MR. KNEEDLER:

15

No.

Isn't that right?

The action agency simply has

16

to consult.

The duty to prepare a comprehensive

17

biological opinion is a duty owed by the consulting agency

18

to the action agency.
QUESTION:

19

Yes.

That's the Fish and Wildlife

20

Service, and that's the one agency you say that can't be

21

sued.

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, but that's -- when you have

23

a question of internal deliberations between two

24

Government agencies and a statute that tells an agency,

25

before you take certain action, talk to the Attorney

General, it would be odd to say you can sue the Attorney

General because of the advice that he gave to the action

agency.

4

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this just as a

5

proposition of administrative law, and I guess it would be

6

under either the APA or the Endangered Species Act.

7

Suppose that the Bureau of Reclamation gets the

8

biological report from the Fish and Wildlife Service.

9

Could it not say that we're not sure that it took into

10

account the best scientific evidence, but we think it's

11

reasonably close, and in our best judgment it's an

12

adequate report?

Can it say that?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

If it says that, then if an aggrieved

15

person under the APA feels that the act -- feels that the

16

report is inadequate, does he sue the Bureau of

17

Reclamation?

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, and the --

QUESTION:

2

And there's no way anybody can get an

accurate biological report.

to give an adequate biological report is what you're

saying.

Nobody.

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

I think no private person.

No private person.
I believe that's --

Just the Secretary.

MR. KNEEDLER:

10

Nobody can compel this agency

I believe that's correct, but

what -- the way -- let me retreat from that just to this

12

extent.

3

QUESTION:

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

6
7

I hope you will.

What would be done is that the

plaintiff would sue the Bureau of Reclamation and said -and say, you proceeded without an adequate basis.

And if

8

the allegation was you proceeded with a report that was -

9

- that didn't rise to the minimum necessary to be a

20

biological opinion under section 7, you have to set aside

your agency action and you, Bureau of Reclamation,

proceed unless you get a more complete biological opinion.

Yes, but the Secretary was only

He was not sued in his capacity in
And the relief sought

10

was to withdraw the biological opinion, not to have the

11

Secretary take other action with respect to the raising or

12

lowering of water.

13

QUESTION:

But you're saying withdrawing the

14

biological opinion is indeed relief that can be sought.

15

If you say you proceeded without an adequate biological

16

opinion, you say you can get a judgment requiring the

17

Secretary to get a proper biological opinion.

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Technically what you would

19

get is a judgment saying you can't go forward with the

21

would be full and complete relief because the Secretary

22

would have to proceed on the basis of something else.

QUESTION:

seems to indicate that standing requirements are somewhat

Well, in that situation we think

you still have to be alleging a concrete injury to

yourself and you have to be alleging that the -- it at

this situation if they're claiming that the Bureau of

Reclamation is not giving them enough water, that arises

3

directly under the reclamation laws and their contracts.

4

And they can say that -- when the Bureau says our defense

is the biological opinion and other information we have,

then they could say, well, that's not an adequate

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY K. WILKINSON

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

3

MR. WILKINSON:

environmental plaintiffs and resource user plaintiffs when

it provided for citizen suit review and APA review.

All we are asking this

If you do that, it renders completely

10

unnecessary this arcane, artificial review process that

the Government is proposing where you have to sue an

expertise, and may in fact disagree with it internally.
