ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. DYK:
the Court:

This case involves the question whether the

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

State of Ohio can discriminate against interstate

3

transactions in the application of its sales and use tax

4

of natural gas purchases.

5

If the purchaser in Ohio, such as General Motors

6

in this case, purchases from a local public utility which

7

supplies the gas through its own distribution lines, the

8

sale or use is exempt.

9

supplied by an interstate marketer of natural gas which

On the other hand, if the gas is

20

has no distribution lines within the State, the purchase

21

is not exempt, and this is --

QUESTION:

When you say discriminate, Mr. Dyk,

23

you suggest that these two entities should be treated as

24

equals.

That there aren't really any factors

MR. DYK:

There are no factors that distinguish

Well, but isn't it a public utility

that we're talking about?
MR. DYK:

12

Justice O'Connor, it is a public

13

utility, but the sales by the public utility are not

14

regulated sales.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I'm very concerned about your

16

theory, frankly, because it seems to me that your theory

17

would really eviscerate public regulation of public

18

utilities.
MR. DYK:

19

Well, I don't think so, Justice

20

O'Connor.

First of all, what we have here is our local

21

public utilities, which are making to a very significant

extent nontariff sales.

1

It wasn't a statute during the tax

period in question.

3

Ohio Public Service Commission to engage in these kinds of

4

sales, and there was a 19 -- October 1987 order, for

5

example, with respect to East Ohio Gas, which I'll lodge

6

with the Court.

8

engage in these kinds of sales, and these went on for a

9

number of years.

10

What you had was permission from the

It's not in the record, but it is a

This is reflected, as I said, in the

record at 229 to 230.
Then last June, this was formalized by statute

11
12

for the first time, and the Ohio legislature said, you

13

don't even have to bother to file these arrangements,

14

these marketing arrangements, with the public utilities

15

commission, you just go ahead and do it, and go on your

16

merry way.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose the unregulated sales were

18

subject to the sales tax so that there would be

19

equivalence between the utility's unregulated sales and

20

the interstate sales, would your case then go away, or

21

would you still argue that there's discrimination?

22

MR. DYK:

23

QUESTION:

I still -- I would -I take it your theory is that there's

still discrimination.
MR. DYK:

I think that -- that is not this case,

1

but there is still discrimination involved, because the

2

public utilities are allowed, under an Ohio law, to file

3

volume discount tariffs and things of that sort which

4

allow them to compete even under the tariffs, and this

5

October

6

which I mentioned shows on its face that Northeast Gas in

7

that particular case was able to compete and actually

8

offer a lower price pursuant to these tariffs.

QUESTION:

But public utilities have a number of

10

other burdens on them, do they not, particularly serving

retail customers.

12

who can't pay the bill, or supply a certain amount of heat

3

during the winter.

4

MR. DYK:

They may have to provide gas to people

They may, Mr. Chief Justice, but they

5

also engage in this unregulated business, and the fact

6

that they are a favored local industry, that the State

7

wishes to protect theme, has not in this Court's other

8

Commerce Clause cases been a sufficient basis for

9

discrimination.
QUESTION:

20

But don't you have to look at their

21

entire business, and not just the part that you single

22

out?

23

MR. DYK:

I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

For example, in the Armco case, which is cited in the

25

amicus brief of Columbia Gas, they had a situation where

1

there was a discrimination against out-of-State

2

wholesalers, and the theory was, well, we can treat inÂ­

3

state manufacturers/wholesalers differently, and the fact

4

that you may combine competitive interstate business with

5

some sort of local business doesn't justify discrimination

6

under the Commerce Clause, and I understand the Court in

7

that case to have directly addressed that question and to

8

resolve it in favor of invalidating the discrimination.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, when you say that these

10

nontariff sales are not part of its regular business, is

11

it also the case that for purposes of determining what

12

their allowable rate of return will be, the profits they

13

make from these sales are not considered, it's just the

14

separate -- they can make as much money as they want from

15

these nonregulated sales, and it will not be considered in

16

fixing their tariffs for the next year.

17
18

MR. DYK:

That is my understanding, Justice

Scalia --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DYK:

Well --- and the purpose of this is, what

21

you have as a result of Federal deregulation is you have a

22

lot of competition in the natural gas market.

sell gas, transport it over interstate pipelines, and the

24

same kind of deregulation has taken place at the State

25

level.

lines and sell it.

Anybody can go into that business.

And as a result of this competition, what

2

3

happened was that the local public utilities were

4

suffering.

5

marketers, and the local public utilities commissions

6

wanted to find some way of enabling these companies to

7

compete with these new marketers, and the way they figured

8

out to allow them to compete in many instances was to say,

9

okay, we'll allow you, too, to make unregulated sales and

10

to act as marketers, and to compete with these interstate

11

businesses so you don't lose the in-State business.

People were going to these interstate

of course.

14

increase their profitability, but that did not come into

15

account in fixing the rates pursuant to the tariffs for

16

natural gas --

17
18

They wanted them to earn additional money to

QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, may I ask you a question on

that score?

19

You've indicated that the same intrastate

20

pipelines are used by both the independent seller and the

21

public utility, and are those pipelines owned by the

22

public utility?

23
24
25

MR. DYK:

They're owned by the public utility,

1

for the gas sold that's delivered through those pipelines

2

in the independent marketer sales?

3

MR. DYK:

Well, what you have is both open

4

access -- that is, people who are not in the public

5

utility business have the right to use those

6

transportation facilities -- and so-called unbundling,

7

which was a concept that originated at the Federal level

8

but also exists at the State level, in which there are

9

separate statements for transportation charges and the

10

transportation charges have to be -- has to be -- have to

11

be justified.

12

Of course, the public utilities really remain as

13

public utilities when they're supplying the transportation

14

service, but that's unbundled.

15

and the rates are calculated separately.

16

QUESTION:

It's charged separately,

And those are -- they're charged

17

separately, but are they controlled by the State public

18

utility commission?

19

MR. DYK:

The transportation rates are still

20

controlled by the State public utility commission, though

21

in some instances even those transportation rates are now

22

being individually negotiated.

23

pursuant to tariffs set by the public utility --

QUESTION:

But by and large those are

If they're individually negotiated,

it would seem to me that the market would take care of the

1

disparity between the taxed and the no-tax sellers.
MR. DYK:

2

Justice Stevens, I'm not under -- I'm

3

not sure why I understand the market would take care of

4

that.

5

What you have is the charges for the gas are

6

stated separately, and if the public utility has an

7

advantage, there's no 5- to 7-percent use tax on the

8

purchases from them, they have an advantage over the

9

interstate seller, who must sell to a purchaser, and the

10

tax is on the purchaser, the purchaser has to pay this 5-

11

to 7-percent tax, and in a business like this, which is

12

highly competitive, 5- to 7-percent can be a significant

3
4

amount of money and a significant advantage.
Now, what the State says is, oh well, we impose

5

a gross receipts tax on the public utilities.

6

is that the gross receipts tax doesn't satisfy this

7

Court's standards for a compensatory tax.

8

imposed on a substantially equivalent event.

9

even imposed on the same people.

20

QUESTION:

The problem

It's not
It's not

Mr. Dyk, is it clear that for what

21

you call the unregulated sales both before it was

22

formalized in the law and under the new law, that those

23

unregulated sales also escaped the sales tax?

24
25

MR. DYK:

Yes, because the natural gas company

is still a supplier of natural gas.

It is still a natural

1

gas company which is supplying the gas over its own

2

distribution lines within the State, and --

3

QUESTION:

Well, couldn't -- could Ohio say,

4

because the public utility has obligations that the State

5

imposes on it, and because the regulated sales have

6

bundled together these other aspects, while there won't be

7

an escape from the sales tax entirely, there will be an

8

allocation, so that only the part that's attributable to

9

the commodity is subject to the sales tax and not the part

10

that's attributable to these other items?
MR. DYK:

11

Well, there is no sales or use tax on

12

the transportation.

13

on the gas purchase, so what you have is a discriminatory

14

situation, and these public utilities have the advantage

15

of being able to act as gas marketers.

16

QUESTION:

There's only a sales or use tax now

Even with respect to the gas, the

17

obligation that you must have enough supply to serve

18

everybody at all times, could that be factored out so that

19

you could make the gas sale of the regulated company

20

similar to the unregulated sale?
MR. DYK:

21

Justice Ginsburg, there are many ways

22

that the State could achieve its interest here without

23

discriminating against interstate commerce, as you

24

suggest.

expressed in some of the amicus briefs in support of the

respondent, if there's concern that residential customers

shouldn't have to pay the sales or use tax on gas

purchases, it's a simple matter to just exempt residential

customers from the sales or use tax.

construct a system that treats equally purchasers from

9

a discriminatory manner.

It's very easy to

It's not hard at all, and there's no

10

I should add that --

11

QUESTION:

Well, you suggested that if there

12

were an exemption for residential customers, no sales tax,

13

that would be all right, but you're recognizing that there

14

can be some recognition by the State that it is imposing,

15

that this is a regulated industry.

16

State do to take into account the obligations that the

17

regulated utility is under?

18

MR. DYK:

What else could the

Well, obviously they could reduce the

19

gross receipts tax, which appears to be what they've done

20

in this new legislation of last June in House bill 476.

21

They don't have to impose this kind of gross receipts tax

22

on public utilities, but what they can't do under this

23

Court's jurisprudence is to say, we're going to have two

24

identical purchases here.

have a use tax; on the other one we're not going to have a

There's a rule of strict equality here, and it

2

3

makes particular sense in the context of this very highly

4

competitive natural gas market, and this is not only true

5

with respect to industrial purchasers, and industrial

6

purchasers are the ones who suffered during the period

7

we're involved in here, but it's going to happen in the

8

residential market also.

9

These -- there are tariffs being filed in Ohio

10

and elsewhere, and I think this is again recognized in the

11

Columbia Gas brief, that will allow competition at the

residential level.

implementing FERC regulations.

the public utilities and between the out-of-State

I take it an apportioned gross

paid their gross receipts tax then your client's suppliers

1

State sellers with a gross receipts tax because of Public

2

Law 86-272, so the State would probably choose to approach

3

it by having a use tax imposed on all people and to

4

remit -- as they apparently are seeking to do in the new

5

legislation remit the gross receipts tax so it doesn't

6

bear so heavily on the public utilities.

7

QUESTION:

Can you tell me, getting back to the

8

unregulated sales that the utilities make, is there

9

anything in the record that gives us an idea of the

10

significance, the percentage of sales that were -- the

11

utility made that were unregulated sales during the tax

12

period in question?

13

MR. DYK:

No, there's no statistic for that.

14

What I think the record reflects is that about 20 percent

15

of the industrial sales continued to be made by public

16

utilities during the period, but there's no breakdown as

17

to what part of that 20 percent is unregulated sales and

18

what part might be pursuant to volume discount tariffs or

19

other things of that sort.

20

Now, what -- the State --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Dyk, I just wanted to make sure,

22

in light of what you said about, that even the residential

23

sales are being deregulated.

25

is a public utility?

residential users, and you stand by that?
MR. DYK:

2

Well, I

-- sure.

Of course they

3

could exempt sales to residential users, as long as a

4

residential user who chooses to purchase from the out-of-

7

is treated the same way.

What Ohio supreme court said here is, well, we

14

don't have any problem here, because this excise tax to be

15

sure is not imposed on the local public utilities, but it

16

is imposed on local gas marketers who are not public

17

utilities under this Court's precedents for over 100

18

years, ranging from the Brimmer case way back when up to

19

this Court's decision in Carbone.

20

The fact that some local people may be

21

disadvantaged is no excuse under the Commerce Clause, and

22

what the State is trying to do now -- and this is not an

23

argument that it made below and not an argument that was

24

adopted by the Ohio supreme court -- it is saying, well,

discrimination that we have made in amendments to the

2

Natural Gas Act that were passed in the early 1950's,

which allowed the State public utilities commissions to

continue to regulate the interstate gas market and

effectively overruled this Court's decision in East Ohio.

that Congress in the fifties authorized this kind of

Mr. Dyk, can I interrupt you for just

a second?

3

In response to Justice Kennedy, you said that

the record indicated that about 20 percent of the utility

sales were industrial sales, but you don't know how much

6

of those were un -- pursuant to volume discount tariffs,

and how much were unregulated.
Assume they were all pursuant to volume discount

tariffs.

Would you win or lose this case?
MR. DYK:

10

Well, I think we would still win,

11

because I think whether the public utility sales are made

12

pursuant to tariffs or are unregulated, that in either

13

event the public utility is a competitor with the out-of-

19

which may be marginal cost tariffs rather than fully

20

differently.

The record doesn't tell us how much the 20

Justice Stevens.

I think this Court has made clear in a

lot of cases that if there is even a small discrimination

8

against interstate commerce, and if you look at the

9

unregulated sales as being the only significant ones,

10

which we don't, there were still some of them, and for

11

example, in Associated Industries and Bacchus the court

12

has said, well, even if the favored sales are very small

in volume, and maybe wouldn't be considered economically

significant, there's no de minimis doctrine under the

It's still invalid.

I think

what you are doing is saying, you can't disfavor the

It shows that they occurred, at pages

MR. DYK:

Well, it is until the sales tax is

20

made constitutional, that our view is that any amount of

21

discrimination against interstate commerce and in favor of

22

a local seller or a purchaser from a local seller is

23

unconstitutional, and I think that this Court has never

There is.

The record confirms that, and the

MR. DYK:

2

Well, I think the argument is that

3

where you have a competitive gas market like this, and --

4

you cannot favor an in-State interest simply because it

5

has public utility status, and I think this Court's

6

decision in Buck and Kuckendall, which is 267 U.S.,

7

dealing with motor transport -- it's an opinion by Justice

8

Brandeis from 1925, but I think it's still good law --

9

says that you can't come in here and say, well, this is a

10

market that needs to be regulated and we're going to

11

require certificates of public interest, convenience and

12

necessity, we're not going to let people compete from out

13

of State.

I think the argument that you could treat a

public utility differently might have had and made sense

20 years ago.

a competitive market, there's a competitive market there

18

as a result of national policy, and I think even if you

had nothing but tariff sales, that you couldn't

discriminate against the out-of-State marketers.

21

wouldn't be permissible under the Commerce Clause.

I don't think it makes sense now.

MR. SUTTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

15

I'd like to start by addressing an argument that

16

I began thinking about about 8:00 last night, and that is

17

the nontariff argument that was just made.

That's

a

It's just not supported by the record or

6

It's not supported by the record because if you

7

look at pages 229 and 230, it doesn't make any indication

8

that there were actually nontariff sales during the audit

period, 1987 through 1989.

10

11

There's nothing in the record

at all that indicates that.
The notion that 20 percent of the sales to

industrial consumers were nontariff sales is also

unsupported.

That's simply not true.

Well, do we have to take this case on

the basis that we assume they were tariff-regulated sales?
MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, yes, I think you do,

but I can make another point, and that is that even if

18

they were nontariff sales, let's say the record actually

19

did support their argument, they've got another hurdle to

20

clear, and that's that Ohio has a doctrine called the dual

capacity doctrine.

QUESTION:

What if you have a long-term contract

5

by the independent marketer who -- that contains all those

6

provisions, we'll deliver gas when it's cold, and we'll

7

guarantee that it will be there and the pipe will be.

8

then are they different?

9

MR. SUTTON:

Why

Your Honor, because in that

10

instance they would be imposing those obligations upon

11

themselves as a matter of contract, not as a matter of

12

State law.

13

both the buyer and the seller, as to whether they wanted

14

to do that.

They would be able independently to bargain,

15

But let me add another point, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

But the other thing that's puzzling

17

about it, the whole rationale for regulating the prices of

18

the utilities are to prevent them from charging too much.

20

MR. SUTTON:

That's absolutely -- that's

absolutely correct.

21

Your Honor, the other problem that marketers are

22

going to have in the situation, I think ultimately there's

23

an end game here.

24

is started at the Federal level is going to inexorably

25

extend to the State level, I think is mistaken.

I think

1

there's a stopping point, and the stopping point is that

2

if you're going to have State utility laws like Ohio does

3

that require utilities -- and let's say they impose it on

4

marketers as well -- to make sure natural gas can be

5

supplied year-round, what happens is, you end up in a

6

situation where the marketer has to own pipeline.

7

There's simply no way the marketer can

8

guarantee, if he or she does not own pipeline, that

9

natural gas is going to be supplied year-round on the

10

coldest day of the winter.

11

utilities will always control, utilities always will have

12

to control.

13

That is a business that

That's something marketers can never do.

They can say as a matter of contract we'll do

14

our best, but the reason they can't guarantee it is,

15

someone else owns the pipeline, and that's the public

16

utility, so that's a fundamental distinction.

17

fundamental distinction that will always be there, and I

18

think as a matter of a State's police power, it's properly

19

always going to be saying to itself, we've got to have a

20

utility industry.

It's a

It might be a different utility industry than we

nothing about the delivery of food that requires you to

QUESTION:

Mr. Sutton, what about Mr. Dyk's

public utilities, but not by the sales tax exemption so

sales.

How do you respond to that?
MR. SUTTON:

Our principle argument, Justice

15

Ginsburg, beyond the argument that they're differently

16

situated, is that these are actually transactions that

17

can't be reconciled.

18

guise of the Commerce Clause should be forcing States to

19

reconcile what are inherently irreconcilable transactions.

I don't think the court under the

The reason they're irreconcilable is number 1,

20
21

because one involves the sale of a naked commodity, the

22

other is a commodity in the service, so they're just, to

begin with, different transactions, different in a way

sale.

The other difference is, of course, the rate

quite how -- I mean, if the Court -- let's just take as an

Ohio, when it comes to public utility sales, you now have

to put a 5- to 7-percent tax on all of those sales.

that it's compensating.

any more integrity in that system than there is in the

It's not clear to me that there's

current one, and that's because the transactions and the

11

sellers are so very different.

12

In fact, I think this Court's compensatory tax

cases most recently Fulton, from just last term, and

Associated Industries from three terms ago, stand for that

very point.

to establish that there was a compensatory tax which

Your Honor, because Westinghouse

7

was a case involving corporate taxation, and I'm making

the point that this would be a corporate taxation setting.

Westinghouse establishes that you can have a

Commerce Clause discrimination at the corporate level --

11

in other words, where sellers are being taxed differently

at the corporate level depending on whether they sell inÂ­

against myself if we lose, I'm just making the point that

QUESTION:

Now we still have in limbo, Mr.

Sutton, that Carnegie you sort of cite, and you say, I

MR. SUTTON:

Right.

Your Honor, I want to make

it perfectly clear, Carnegie helps us.

Carnegie helps us is because that's a setting, or that's a

case that suggests of a utility transaction took place

I think that's an odd rule, and that's why our

3

fundamental argument is that they're differently situated

May I ask, just supposing, if Ohio

wanted to, could it impose on the competitor, the

11

obligation to sell only at the same price that the utility

can charge?

13

MR. SUTTON:

Your Honor, I think in this

14

instance they'd have difficulty doing that, because the

transactions occurred out of State, so that they simply

16

couldn't do that.

17

happened if it were in-State, and that happens here, some

of these transactions were by in-State marketers,

It's particularly good for industrial consumers.

10

We're just -- the only thing we're going to condition it

Mr. Sutton, just to clear out one

thing, you're not arguing standing any more at this --

MR. SUTTON:

No, we're not, Your Honor.

9

Your Honor, I'd like to very briefly address the

10

congressional authority argument that we have also raised.

11

Let me tell you why it's a difficult argument, but why I

12

think we can still make it.

13

because back in 1938 when the Natural Gas Act was passed,

14

and again when it was amended in 1953, I don't think it

15

was in any Congressman or -woman's mind that they needed

16

to pass this law to constitutionalize the status of

17

utilities, so that's a problem I had.

18

wasn't something they were after.

19

fill a regulatory void with respect to interstate

20

transportation of gas.

It's a difficult argument

It simply just

They were trying to

But that said, the language does the trick.

21

The

22

language indicates that there's a dichotomy between all

23

retail sales on the one hand and all wholesale sales on

24

the other.

25

have are retail transactions, and under section 1(b) and

In this instance, that's all we have.

reason is straightforward.

It doesn't use the magic words,

We don't think Congress had to use the magic words,

Number 1, the text of the Commerce Clause

10

itself, of course, uses the word regulate.

11

nothing about tax, and we wouldn't be here if the word

12

regulate in the Constitution didn't cover discriminatory

13

taxes, so that's a starting point.

14

It says

A second point is a matter of common sense.

As

15

this Court has indicated, is the word regulate does cover

16

tax.

17

28, and again in one of their amicus briefs, at page 13 of

18

the Chamber of Commerce brief, they made that very point.

19

The Chamber of Commerce said, what's going on here is Ohio

20

is using taxes as a back-door way to regulate marketers,

21

so I think as a matter of common understanding, everyone

22

understands the broad term regulate to cover taxes.

23

Indeed, in General Motors' own opening brief at page

There's another reason why this is legitimate,

24

under congressional blessing, and that's the fact that

this is important for the Commerce Clause issue as well.

What Ohio has done is treated the marketers like all other

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY B. DYK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DYK:

10

Just very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice,

16

public utility sales are exempt.

There's no basis for that in the

The statute does not distinguish between

18

And while we think the interpretation of the

19

Carnegie case that they supply is not correct, if that

20

interpretation is correct, what they're saying is, anybody

21

who can claim the status of public utility can come into

22

any part of the State and make exempt sales as a gas

23

marketer, whereas the out-of-State companies are never

24

going to get the exemption if they can't claim that public

25

utility status.
