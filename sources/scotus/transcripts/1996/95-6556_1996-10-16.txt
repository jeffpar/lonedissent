CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

States.
Mr. Donovan, you may proceed whenever you're

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL DONOVAN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DONOVAN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The fact of the prior felony conviction, not the

12

13

nature of the prior felony conviction,

14

the offense of felon in possession of a firearm.

15

and nature of that underlying conviction is not relevant

16

to that issue.

17

QUESTION:

is an element of
The name

Well, when we're talking about --

18

we're talking about admissibility of evidence, here,

19

take it.

20

MR. DONOVAN:

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

Ordinarily you don't start talking

22

about the relevance of a - - you look at the piece of

23

evidence and you say,

24
25

I

MR. DONOVAN:

is it relevant, don't you?
Yes, and in this particular case

there were pieces of evidence that we contended weren't

relevant.

2
3

QUESTION:

Well, what was it, a certificate of

prior conviction?

4

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, also the indictment itself.

5

It's a practice of this judge to have the prosecutor read

6

the indictment to the jury at the time of the voir dire,

7

so we had come in pretrial and filed a motion in limine

8

asking the judge to prohibit that reading as well as the

9

prejudicial -- we contend the prejudicial parts from the

10

j udgment - QUESTION:

11

But that's not raised in your

12

petition for certiorari.

13

defendant in a felon in possession of firearms case offers

14

to stipulate to his status as a felon,

15

court require the Government to accept the stipulation.

16

So it's no different whether the judge read the indictment

17

or whether there was a certificate of prior conviction,

18

there, under that question?
MR. DONOVAN:

19

The question is,

if the

should the district

Well, yes, but we did do three

20

things.

21

the second thing was offer to stipulate, and the third

22

thing, we submitted a proposed jury instruction we felt

23

even went farther than stipulation and admitted,

24

basically,

25

The first thing was move in limine to exclude,

the fact or the element.
QUESTION:

But your -- the question you raise

is

1

with us is whether the Government should have been

2

required to accept the stipulation.

3

MR. DONOVAN:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And so we're talking now about a

5

piece -- what, a certificate of conviction of some sort

6

was offered?

7

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, we only made a verbal offer.

8

We never got farther than that because the Government

9

basically said we don't have to stipulate if we don't want

10

to.

The trial judge said they don't have to stipulate if

11

they - QUESTION:

12

13

So what was it that the Government

offered?

14

MR. DONOVAN:

They offered a -- well, aside from

15

reading the indictment and mentioning it during the trial,

16

they offered the judgment and conviction document.

17

QUESTION:

Okay, so the question, it seems to

18

me, if you're talking about normal application of the

19

rules of evidence, is, is this judgment of conviction

20

relevant, and it seems to me you have to answer yes, don't

21

you?

22

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, it may be relevant in

23

general, but what I was saying was, parts of it were not

24

relevant, and I tried to solve that problem pretrial, and

25

the judge basically said no.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Donovan, when the judge had said

2

no, did you then offer the statement as a signed

3

admission, even though the Government had not stipulated

4

to its correctness?

5

MR. DONOVAN:

No.

I just fell back and put the

6

Government to their proof, basically, but I still renewed

7

the objection during the trial.

8

9
10

QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that the

Government -- I mean the stipulation is by -- I think is
by definition a statement in which each party concurs.

11

MR. DONOVAN:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And I presume there isn't any power

13

in a court to make the Government concur in something it

14

doesn't want to concur in.

15

MR. DONOVAN:

That's true.

What I'm really

16

saying is that I think a stipulation is the best remedy

17

for this problem, and I'm asking --

18

QUESTION:

No, but the problem doesn't arise

19

under the rule until there is at least some alternative

20

evidence under the rule, and if you're saying the evidence

21

is the stipulation, and the Government hasn't signed it,

22

you haven't got a stipulation, and you don't have that

23

kind of evidence.

24
25

And that's why I asked you the question, when
the Government wouldn't stipulate so that you couldn't

offer a stipulation, did you have a kind of fallback

2

evidence like saying, okay, judge, we've signed it, and my

3

client has signed a statement saying, I did thus and so,

4

or I was convicted of thus and so, and we're offering this

as evidence as an admission.

been evidence, but I take it that was not in this case.

7

MR. DONOVAN:

That, I presume, would have

What I did, though, I did offer a

8

proposed jury instruction whereby the jury would instruct

9

the -- or the judge would instruct the jury that you are

10

hereby instructed that the defendant, Johnny Lynn Old

11

Chief, has been convicted of an offense punishable by a

12

term of imprisonment exceeding 1 year, and I think

13

that's --

14
15

QUESTION:

That was in the nature of an

admission, you're saying?

16

MR. DONOVAN:

17

QUESTION:

Right.

Yes, but you did that on the

18

assumption, or in order to build a case that the evidence

19

of the nature of the crime must have been - - must be

20

excluded based on your instruction.

21

MR. DONOVAN:

Yes, that's true.

22

QUESTION:

Well --

23

QUESTION:

It seems to me this is very much of

24

a 403 case, and I think the Government concedes as much.

25

I don't see that as necessarily presented by your

1

question.

2

and I don't see you arguing it in your brief.

3

That's why the case is a little hard to grasp,

MR. DONOVAN:

I think the problem is the Ninth

4

Circuit case, the Breitkreutz case, which the

5

Government -- the prosecutor and the trial judge relied on

6

I think is decided wrong, because it says if there is an

7

offer to stipulate in this kind of a case you don't apply

8

403, but I think clearly the Government's admitted here,

9

and they admitted I think in 1992 in a case that was

10

argued called Hadley, that an offer to trigger, or offer

11

to stipulate - -

MR. DONOVAN:

MR. DONOVAN:

analysis here.

Well --- and we never had such an

It's therefore --

18

QUESTION:

I don't -- excuse me.

19

QUESTION:

Supposing that a criminal defendant

20

is charged with the offense of murder, is the Government

21

required to simply accept a statement from him that yes, I

22

killed this person, rather than have the evidence put on

23

by the Government as to how the person was killed, and

24

that sort of thing?

25

MR. DONOVAN:

I don't -- I don't think the

1

2

Government's required to do that.
QUESTION:

Well, why -- if you're right on the

3

felony point, why isn't the Government required to accept

4

a stipulation on some other element of the crime?

5

MR. DONOVAN:

I think this -- I'm asking the

6

Court just to focus on this one statute, and I'm saying in

7

addition to the stipulation issue that the nature of the

8

prior conviction is not relevant, and --

9

QUESTION:

Well, maybe -- can't the defendant in

10

my hypothesis argue that this -- the evidence as to how he

11

killed the defendant could be very prejudicial, and it

12

really doesn't make any difference in the eyes of the law

13

so long as he killed him.

14

MR. DONOVAN:

I think that's true, but you start

15

with a proposition that that evidence is relevant, and

16

then of course you could argue 403.

17

QUESTION:

But you start with the proposition

18

that this evidence is relevant.

19

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, if you combine the total --

20

if you're calling the total judgment and conviction

21

document itself relevant, yes, but what I'm saying is part

22

of that judgment includes the nature and name of the prior

23

felony, which isn't relevant, as well as the fact that Old

24

Chief got 60 months, obviously, which is more than --

25

QUESTION:

But why doesn't that just raise a

section 403 balance question, rather than some question of

2

whether the Government has to accept a stipulation?

3
4

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, I did raise that at the

trial level, and the problem with the Ninth --

MR. DONOVAN:

I argued 403 balance here.

7

saying if you assume this is

QUESTION:

10

I'm

But the question, as the Chief

Justice pointed out, just asks whether we have to accept
the offer of the defendant to stipulate.

11

MR. DONOVAN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DONOVAN:

Yes, and --

And surely the answer to that is no.
Well, that's true, Justice

14

O'Connor, but what I'm trying to get the Court to look at

15

are some of the circuit cases, Tavares in the First

16

Circuit, and what -- basically what that says is the offer

17

to stipulate triggers a process and then the Government

18

has to come in and prove under 403 that there is probative

19

value which - -

20

QUESTION:

I don't see what relevance the offer

21

to stipulate has.

I mean, if the Government doesn't have

22

to accept it, and I think it doesn't, then it just doesn't

23

trigger anything.

24

MR. DONOVAN:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

You'd have to raise the 403 issue,

1

and ask whether what is offered by the Government is

2

unduly prejudicial and unfair.

3

MR. DONOVAN:

And I think I did that, but I got

4

ignored, and again, I feel because of the law in the Ninth

5

Circuit, the case -- Breitkreutz says if you object, if

6

you offer to stipulate, you don't apply the 403 balancing

7

test.

8

QUESTION:

But --

9

QUESTION:

Well, I think it's true that even the

10

Government at page 28 of its brief, a paragraph I can't

11

quite square with its position, says that once there is an

12

unconditional offer to stipulate, then 403 analysis is

13

triggered, so in that sense I think the Government seems

14

to agree with you on that point.

15

MR. DONOVAN:

16
17

Yes, and Ninth Circuit law says

you don't trigger it.
QUESTION:

18

case, wasn't it?

19

was on the panel.

But the -- Tavares was a pure 403

I mean, I think I remember.

20

MR. DONOVAN:

21

QUESTION:

I think I

Yes.

Pure 403.

It says that in the

22

presence -- there are a lot of ways you can keep the

23

prejudicial thing out.

24

dozens of ways, and if the defendant comes in, offers to

25

stipulate, then there's just one additional important way

You can redact it.

There may be

1

that the Government doesn't need it, and that goes in the

2

403 balance.

3

MR. DONOVAN:

And the Tavares test in the first

4

Circuit stands for the proposition if the Government

5

refuses to stipulate, you still exclude that evidence by

6

some other means, and the First --

7

QUESTION:

I thought --

8

QUESTION:

Mr. Donovan, your argument and also

9

your reliance on 403 assumes that the only evidence

10

admissible is evidence which is probative.

11

403 says, if it's probative value is outweighed by

12

something else.

13

Is that the case?

That's what

It seems to me a lot of

14

evidence gets in in trial routinely to simply place a

15

crime in its context.

16

victim, as the Chief Justice was alluding to.

17

think the identity of the victim, if it happened to be

18

Mother Teresa, could be kept out of the case --

19

MR. DONOVAN:

20

QUESTION:

For example, the identity of the
Do you

No, I --- on the grounds of what difference

21

does it make who it was?

It was a murder, and pleading

22

403, you should suppress the fact that it was Mother

23

Teresa.

24

of the circumstances of the event which the State is

25

entitled to get in.

I doubt whether you have to do that.

It's part

1

MR. DONOVAN:

I think in comparison you start

2

with the proposition that the victim of the - - the

3

evidence of the victim of the crime is a relevant

4

question.
QUESTION:

5

No.

It's no more relevant than the

6

nature of the prior crime in your case.

7

human being is all that's necessary for the conviction.

8

The identity of the human being makes no difference.
MR. DONOVAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

It was a dead

Well --

So if I come in with a stipulation, I

11

stipulate there was a dead human being, whereupon you

12

think the State could be precluded from introducing who

13

the human being was, placing this event in its real life

14

context, simply because that would be harmful to the

15

defendant?

I doubt it.
MR. DONOVAN:

16

I think that does place it in the

17

real life context and get into evidence of the act and

18

intent of the crime, and one thing I'm saying here, the

19

status of the felon is not part of the act and intent of

20

the crime.

21

It's something different.
QUESTION:

Are you saying that because of the

22

state of the law in the Ninth Circuit there was no way you

23

could have gotten a 403 balance?

24

what -- the exact question you were asking us to decide,

25

however you phrased it in your cert petition.

I'm confused about

SUITE 400

I thought

1

you said that in the Ninth Circuit, as distinguished from

2

the First Circuit, there is no possibility for a 403

3

balancing on whether the jury will be told the name of the

4

felony.

5
6

7

MR. DONOVAN:

That's how I read the Ninth

Circuit Breitkreutz case, Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION:

So what you're challenging is circuit

8

law that says that the character, the crime, the actual

9

crime, the name of that crime is not something that the

10

judge should weigh in a 403 balance, it just comes in

11

automatically.

12

Is that what you're saying?

MR. DONOVAN:

I think the Ninth Circuit says

13

that automatically comes in regardless of defense

14

objection or defense offer to stipulate.

15

that's how I got here.

16

QUESTION:

That's why I got here.

But that certainly isn't the question

17

you present us with.

18

decision might be wrong.

19
20
21

And I think

It's whether that Ninth Circuit

MR. DONOVAN:

No, I -- I mean, it's an aspect of

the question, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, what if a criminal defendant

22

and his lawyer figure that our only chance is to raise a

23

defense of justifiable homicide, that you killed in self-

24

defense, can that defendant come in and say, I stipulate

25

to all the elements of the crime of murder, that it was -14

1

I killed him unlawfully, et cetera, et cetera, and can the

2

Government be required to accept that sort of stipulation,

3

and only argue about -- the only evidence you really hear

4

is about whether there was justification or not?
MR. DONOVAN:

5

I don't think so.

I think the

6

Government is entitled to present a full picture of that,

7

and it also relates to whether or not there was self-

8

defense .

9
10
11
12

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, why can't it present a full

picture of the felony that the person was convicted of?
MR. DONOVAN:
not relevant.
QUESTION:

Well, if it's not relevant, then you

don't ever get to a 403 balancing.

15

MR. DONOVAN:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19
20
21

Well, my first argument is, it's

That's right.

You simply would exclude it

automatically.
MR. DONOVAN:

And I think that's the rule of the

First Circuit, is just that, but -QUESTION:

It is a relevant part.

The relevant

part is that the felony was committed.

22

MR. DONOVAN:

23

QUESTION:

That's --

The question is, how do you -- I

24

mean, the question is, how do you get in that relevant

25

part without going into all the details, and the

1

difference between doing that with an ancient felony and

2

doing it with the details of the accused felony, i.e. the

3

present crime, the difference, because you don't allow it

4

with the present crime, I thought the Chief Justice's

5

question is, why do you allow it with the past crime, and

6

the answer to that is?

7

MR. DONOVAN:

Well, the -- I believe the answer

8

is whether or not it's a qualifying crime is a question of

9

law for the Court to determine, and whether or not the

10

defendant in fact committed that crime, or was convicted

11

of that crime, is a question of fact --

12

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps --

13

MR. DONOVAN:

14

QUESTION:

A question of fact for the jury.

- - on a somewhat broader picture, can

15

the criminal defense in a sense require the Government to

16

accept a lot of stipulations so that a very abstract

17

picture is presented to the jury simply almost in terms of

18

judges, rather than having live evidence describe what

19

happened?

20

MR. DONOVAN:

No.

No, I don't think it can, but

21

the defendant can offer to stipulate or object and get a

22

QUESTION:

I'm --

That's essentially --

to explain if I have to write the opinion, but it seems to

7

me that that's where you're going.
MR. DONOVAN:

8

9

Well, I think I am going there,

and I'm asking the Court to consider the Tavares rule, and

10

I think the Tavares rule is better summarized in the case

11

of Melvin, which is cited in the amicus brief, and that

12

basically Melvin states that in a felony possession of a

13

firearm case, evidence of the nature of a prior -- of the

14

nature of the prior conviction is not admissible unless

15

the Government establishes probative value in the 403

16

balancing process, and I think that is a simple rule to

17

apply.

18

QUESTION:

Could I go back to your answer to the

19

Chief Justice's question?

20

He asked you whether the defendant could in effect render

21

a trial a very abstract proceeding by asking the

22

Government to stipulate all of the elements of the crime

23

with the only issue left being whether the defendant in

24

fact committed it or not, and you said no, but then you

25

followed up with an explanation that seemed to me to mean

I really didn't understand it.

example, I think the trial court's rule on photographs,

photograph is too gory, but this one isn't, and the

prosecution may say, we want to use a real gory

it out, even though the Government wants to introduce it.

MR. DONOVAN:

3

QUESTION:

Right.

It applies both ways.

Under your view I take it the

Redacted.

And then the jury has to read

something that's redacted.

11

it seems to me.
MR. DONOVAN:

12

That's an odd way to proceed,

I think -- and that's one of my

13

arguments to advocate a stipulation is better than a

14

redacted judgment and conviction, because if you redact

15

the judgment and conviction by crossing out lines and

16

such, I think that invites jury speculations of what was

17

crossed out, whereas if you have a clean stipulation, it

18

is hereby stipulated, the jury either hears that or reads

19

that, and there's less likelihood for speculation to come

20

up.

QUESTION:

Well, but if there's so much trouble

in enforcing the rule you propose, maybe that indicates

that we shouldn't try to make the effort.

The historical

1

Well, but I think the reason this

Court has to do something is, there's a different rule in

some of the circuits, and my circuit, obviously the Ninth

Circuit happens to be against the defendant, and the other

5

circuits, most of the other circuits now would rule in my

favor.

whether the evidence of the nature of the felony offense,

A much harder question for me is to answer whether it is

says, I'm going to contest whether or not I was convicted

MR. ESTRADA:

Because the definitional section

certain offenses, and in order for the jury to fulfill its

what offenses are covered and whether the one that they

2

have heard evidence on is actually one of those offenses.

3

In other words, under our theory of the case, a

proper instruction would be, I instruct you that mail

fraud is one of the offenses that is covered.

you to find that -- whether this particular defendant has

The best evidence rule I think

12

textually would apply, and I think it is not usually

understands in the more specific factual context here that

it as a concession that 403 analysis can apply in these
cases.
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I guess that is literally

true, but it does not convey the understanding that maybe
we inartfully put into it.

What we meant is that in every

ruling in a trial court there is always a 403 issue.

That

is to say, there is always open the argument that upon a
consideration of the proper factors the evidence should be
excluded.
The fact that a weighing might be conducted, and
the fact that an admission might properly be considered in
the weighing says nothing about the outcome of the
weighing, and -QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, I have problems with

that argument in this context, that we can allow every
district judge in the land to have a 403 balance when,
say, the conviction is for assault with a deadly weapon,
and Judge A will come out this way, and Judge B will come
out that way.

I think that's why the Court had some

interest in this case, because there is disarray, and the
one thing that we all have an interest in is to say what
the law is, and it should be that same law, so what's
disturbing about your suggestion is that, oh, 403, and
that's it, it will all wash out in every individual court.

it's evidence within the meaning of Rule 403, that there
would at least have to be a 403 balancing.

MR. ESTRADA:

No.

What I said earlier about

what the rules of evidence contemplate as being within the
proper scope, I think there's emphasis, because at the
time that the rules came into being in 1975, it was
already a settled rule that the Government could not be
required to accept a stipulation because it always has the
burden of proof and it always bears the risk of
nonpersuasion, and it is their burden to show that there
is something in the rules that changes that.

what has been referred to as a written admission, is there
any recognition of that sort of an instrument in the Rules

doesn't have to be accepted, but if it's offered and the

Government refuses to accept it, at that point the judge

in his 403 exercise of discretion should require the

event, even if you put in the crime itself, the judge

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, but it is an instruction on

MR. ESTRADA:

It is never unfair, because it is

inherent in the nature of the crime that Congress

9

necessarily contemplated that we would prove this element

10

in the vast run of cases in which there was a trial with

this very evidence, and it may be that the defendant

doesn't like it, but it is his judgment of conviction, and

13

it is relevant evidence.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, if you are now taking

15

the position that the Government would win every time

mean in your brief when you said, consistent with those

principles, where a defendant offers an unconditional

stipulation coupled with an adequate jury charge, the

stipulation as one of the factors in the Rule 403 balance?

22

MR. ESTRADA:

Maybe that wasn't clear, and

that's our fault, Justice Ginsburg, but the structure of

24

the argument is as follows:

something that can be forced upon the Government, then it

3

only comes into play once it has given us adequate

insurance against the risk of nonpersuading the jury,

which means that it has to be coupled with an instruction

that effectively tells the jury that we are home on the

If you disagree that a stipulation is

In this case, and it bears emphasis, while
tendering an instruction that ostensibly took this issue

from the jury, Mr. Old Chief also tendered an instruction

that reminded the jury that we kept the burden of proof on

every element of the crime, and that is exactly the danger

that I'm trying to highlight for the Court.

14

All of the issues that Justice Breyer brought

up, whether you could enter a severance, whether you could

8

9

MR. ESTRADA:

Mm-hmm.

That flows not from a

case from this Court, Justice Ginsburg, but from a

10

recognition that the Advisory Committee note indicates

11

that the availability of alternative means of proof is a

12

factor that should be considered by a court in ruling on

13

the admissibility of evidence under Rule 403, and

14

conceivably, the existence of a stipulation that acts as

an alternative means of proof, if it is, in fact, such,

should be considered in keeping with what the Advisory

we thought was the unfair prejudice was this.
Even if you assume it is relevant to show it

10
11

isn't an antitrust violation, which is I guess the only

12

way in which it's relevant, that it isn't a business

13

violation -- there was an argument in the court about

14

that.

15

We did think that there was tremendously unfair

16

prejudice, and the reason that it was unfair prejudice was

17

because there would be concern, as the policy of Rule 404

18

suggests, that a jury uncertain about whether the person

19

committed the crime in front of them -- in front of them.

20

You know, the present crime -- might think, well, I've

21

just learned he was a triple ax murderer, he was -- in

22

fact had loads of drugs previously, in fact beat his

23

family, in fact did seven other really quite bad things

24

previously, and therefore, although I, the juror, am

25

uncertain about whether he committed the present crime,

he's a bad guy, we'll put him away.
I mean, it's that kind of unfair prejudice that

we thought might flow from introducing the irrelevant,

crime.

So I'm putting that in front of you so you can
then respond to it.
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, the answer, Justice Breyer,

is that the irrelevant item of evidence is the judgment of

10

conviction.

11

that parts of a relevant piece of evidence will be misused

12

not as a question of relevancy but as a question to be

13

dealt with under Rule 105 with limiting instructions,

14

because a background principle of our system is that

15

juries will follow such instructions.

16

The Rules of Evidence treat the possibility

With respect, I would also suggest to you that

17

part of what drove the court of appeals in Tavares is a

18

little bit of a disagreement with the congressional policy

19

that is reflected in the statute, that it is unfair to

20

have a crime that holds someone who has already done his

21

time and paid his debt to society, but if the evidence is

22

what Congress necessarily must have anticipated would be

23

used to prove that element of the crime, you may think

24

that it is not a fair statute, but that's not a problem

25

with the evidence, it's a problem with the policy of the

statute, which is for the people across the street.

2

QUESTION:

I don't think we thought that.

3

QUESTION:

It seems to me that you have a per se

4

answer for your position, and that Tavares is based on an

5

assessment of the likelihood of prejudice that the two

6

arguments don't quite meet.

7

responsive, but it does leave one with the lingering

8

feeling that there's going to be unfair prejudice in some

9

cases, and you say that's just the way the statute works.

10

MR. ESTRADA:

11

QUESTION:

I'm not saying it's not

Well --

And I know of no other area -- we're

12

talking about the difficulty of having a per se rule in

13

the petitioner's favor.

14

almost a per se rule that you're arguing for in your

15

favor, and I'm not sure I know of another one in the law.

On the other hand, you have

19

We cannot get a directed verdict no matter how

20

overwhelming the evidence, and it is open to the defendant

21

to invite doubt as to any piece of evidence, even his own

22

admission, and because that has always been the rule in

23

our system, it was already the substantive law in 1975

24

that we could not be required to accept a stipulation from

25

our opponent.

Under the substantive criminal law, we always

QUESTION:

But isn't the extreme -- Mr. Estrada,

isn't the extreme unlikelihood of success in inviting

doubt about either a stipulation or an admission what

takes the stipulation and the admission about a status out

of what might be a general rule in your favor about

7

proving the elements of the - - or the case in the sense of

8

the acts of the defendant in this particular instance?

9

Isn't it unlikely that they will doubt the one,

10

more likely that they will doubt the other, and that is

11

why bloodless and nonprejudicial evidence is more

12

justifiable in the first case than in the second case?

13

No, and you need go no further

than this case to realize -- and we quote this at page 29

of our brief.
