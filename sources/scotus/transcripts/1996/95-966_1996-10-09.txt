ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 95-966
MR. McALLISTER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The minor children of the decedent in the

12

13

wrongful death suit underlying this case have raised

14

before this Court two independent and potentially

15

dispositive legal issues.

16

punitive damages that the children received in connection

17

with the death of their mother are excludable from gross

18

income as any damages received on account of personal

19

injuries.

20

The first is whether the

The statute on its face does not contemplate a

21

distinction between punitive and compensatory damages.

22

The statute says any damages, a word that the United

23

States frequently does not include in its quotations of

24

the statute in its brief in this Court.

25

Certainly, there was a longstanding -- has been

1

a longstanding understanding in tort law that there is a

2

difference between punitive and compensatory damages, and

3

this Court has often stated that Congress is presumed to

4

have known the state of the common law when it enacts

5

statutes.
Congress easily could have said only

6

7

compensatory damages received on account of personal

8

injuries should be excluded, but it did not do so.

9

said, any damages received on account of personal injuries

10

It

should be excluded.
In fact, when Congress has wanted to draw a

11
12

distinction between punitive and compensatory damages it

13

has expressly done so, for example, in the Federal Tort

14

Claims Act, in which Congress precluded liability of the

15

United States for punitive damages arising from the

16

tortious conduct of its employees and, indeed, the IRS

17

itself has at times read this statute in precisely the way

18

we contend it should be read, to exclude any and all

19

damages that are recovered in connection with a personal

20

injury suit.
QUESTION:

21

Well, of course, you've now used the

22

term, in connection with, but the statute says on account

23

of, and it's my impression the Government's position is

24

that punitive damages are not on account of the personal

25

injuries.

1

MR. MCALLISTER:

That is certainly the

2

Government's contention, Your Honor, and we believe that's

3

wrong for several reasons.

4

to the language of the statute as originally enacted in

5

1918, the substance of it has not changed, but the

6

organization and the order has changed to some extent.

7

First of all, if you look back

The original provision in 1918 basically

8

excluded accident or health insurance benefits or Worker's

9

Comp benefits which the sentence then said, received as

10

compensation for personal injuries, plus any damages

11

received on account of personal injuries whether by suit

12

or agreement, so that the statute itself, when you look at

13

how it was originally enacted, it was a very odd way that

14

Congress intended all of those things to be limited to

15

compensation, to list certain things followed by the

16

phrase, received as compensation for personal injuries,

17

and then to go on and say, plus any damages received on

18

account of personal injuries.

19

Furthermore, when this Court talked about the on

20

account of language in its decision in Schleier recently

21

the Court talked about whether the damages were

22

attributable to an underlying personal injury, or whether

23

the underlying personal injury affected the amount.

24
25

The Court concluded that liquidated damages
under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act did not

1

satisfy either of those conditions, but punitive damages

2

are different.

3

conditions in a couple of ways.

4

Punitive damages do satisfy those

First of all, as this Court recognized recently

5

in BMW v. Gore, punitive damages both the availability and

6

the appropriate amount in most jurisdictions depends on

7

considerations of the underlying harm, the nature of the

8

harm, the extent of the harm.

9

Gore recognizes as much when it talks about the

10

first factor, for example, the reprehensibility of the

11

conduct, talks about personal injury is more egregious

12

than property damage, a physical injury in essence is more

13

serious than perhaps a dignitary injury, and most

14

jurisdictions, if not all, recognize those concepts as far

15

as punitive damages are concerned in determining whether

16

they're appropriate and then what amount is necessary.

17

Furthermore, it's the rule in virtually all

18

jurisdictions, again, if not all, and the traditional rule

19

is that there can be no award of punitive damages in the

20

absence of proof of actual harm and generally in the

21

absence of proof of actual damages, that there needs to be

22

an actual compensatory award made before punitive damages

23

are allowed at all, and for those reasons, even within the

24

attributable-to language and the affecting the amount

25

language that this Court endorsed in Schleier, the

1

punitive damages in this case satisfy that test in a way

2

that the liquidated damages under the Age Discrimination

3

in Employment Act did not.
Furthermore, punitive damages, as we've

4
5

suggested, do sometimes serve compensatory purposes, so

6

even if the Court is to view it in that fashion,

7

historically that was clearly the case.

8

Black's Law Dictionary from the time period when this

9

statute was enacted, which clearly contemplates that in

10

We've cited the

some situations they serve a compensatory purpose.
But even more recently, in the 1996 amendment to

11
12

this statute Congress recognized that sometimes what the

13

States call punitive damages may, in fact, serve

14

compensatory purposes, and that recognition is in the new

15

section 104(c), in which Congress has said in the new

16

104(a)(2) punitive damages are no longer excluded, except,

17

it says in subsection (c), in a wrongful death suit where

18

only punitive damages are allowed, and the jurisdiction of

19

which I'm aware is Alabama.

others.

There may be a couple of

Congress has said in that circumstance those
punitive damages are excluded, apparently because -QUESTION:

Where is that set forth?

there were some place where the whole text of the current

code is set forth, including that amendment, and there was

an '89 amendment?

Is

MR. McALLISTER:

2

There's an '89 amendment, Your

3

Honor, which altered the scope of the original.

4

amendment does not appear in any of the original briefs

5

because it was passed by Congress in August and signed by

6

the President in August, after the briefing had been

7

completed.
Part of the text is included in the supplemental

8

9

The 1996

briefs.

I don't know if 104(c) is actually included in

10

the supplemental briefs, but that text was all extremely

11

recent and after the merits briefing was basically

12

completed in this case.

13

The 1989 amendment is discussed in the briefs.

14

QUESTION:

Well, of course, you know, when I

15

read the United States Code I don't do it piece by piece

16

and figure out which paragraph was enacted in 1918 and

17

which was enacted in 1989, or 1996.

18

and it seems to me one has to decide whether punitive

19

damages are covered or not on the basis of the whole text

20

as it now appears.

21

MR. McALLISTER:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

I read it as a whole,

Well, I think that's correct.

I'd like to see the whole thing set

forth somewhere.
QUESTION:

Mr. McAllister, as far as the most

recent amendment is concerned the effective date is from

1

the time of that enactment, so that is not law for

2

purposes of this case.
MR. MCALLISTER:

3

It's certainly not, Your Honor,

4

in terms of resolving the statutory interpretation issue

5

present here.

6

1996 amendment Congress itself is recognizing that

7

sometimes punitive damages may serve compensatory

8

purposes.

9

All I'm trying to suggest is that in the

The example it recognized is the Alabama

10

situation, where in a wrongful death suit all the

11

plaintiff is allowed to recover, the only thing is

12

punitive damages and Congress said, even though those are

13

labeled punitive damages by the State of Alabama, we want

14

them to be excludable under section 104.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

And what about the '89 amendment?

Was that also only prospective?
MR. MCALLISTER:

The '89 amendment was

18

prospective, but it's important, because what the '89

19

amendment does, it can be read two ways, but what the

20

lower courts have strongly endorsed is the view that what

21

Congress understood at the time was that all punitive

22

damages as of 1989 were excludable under section 104.

23

There was a debate between the House and the

24

Senate as to how they might narrow the scope of that.

25

What they ultimately ended up with was a provision that

1

says the exclusion shall not apply in any case not

2

involving physical injury or physical sickness, and that

3

narrowed the scope, but it remained the case that punitive

4

damages received in a physical injury case are excludable

5

and in fact the House -QUESTION:

6

Mr. McAllister, I don't understand

7

your reference to lower courts.

I thought that this pre-

8

19 -- for pre-1989 and post 1989 to 1996 that all circuits

9

said that these awards, punitive damages awards, whether

10

on account of personal injury or on account of something

11

else, are taxable.

12

except the Sixth Circuit?

13

MR. MCALLISTER:

Isn't that the law in all the circuits

I don't believe that's correct,

14

and certainly most of the cases come after the 1989

15

amendment, and what I'm suggesting is that the lower

16

courts have, when they've decided these cases, looked at

17

that amendment and said, what --

18

QUESTION:

What circuit, other than the Sixth

19

Circuit, has ruled in favor of taxpayers on these

20

challenges?
MR. McALLISTER:

21

You're right in that no circuit

22

other than the Sixth Circuit has ruled in favor of

23

taxpayers.

24

favor of the taxpayers.

The tax court itself had at times ruled in

the Skolson rule, so -MR. McALLISTER:

2

3

Was reversed by circuits on

further review.

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

5

MR. McALLISTER:

That's correct.

The point I'm

6

trying to make is that the 1989 amendment shows what

7

Congress understood the law to be, and that is certainly

8

not determinative or conclusive in our view, but that may

9

well be, or should be accorded some weight and some

10

consideration here in that what Congress understood the

11

statute to do is exactly -- in 1989 is exactly what we are

12

contending it does, and most of the lower courts that have

13

looked at it have said that it certainly appears that

14

Congress understood the statute to exclude all punitive

15

damages up to the point at which it amended it in 1989.
QUESTION:

16

Is -- in line with your view, if

17

you're correct that these awards are not taxable, then

18

juries should have been charged, should they not, that

19

whatever you award in punitive damages will not be subject

20

to tax?

21

MR. McALLISTER:

They could have been charged

22

that, Your Honor, and certainly, if punitive damages are

23

subject to taxation, they probably should also be

24

instructed that that is the case, so that the damages that

25

they are awarding will be taxed and the plaintiff will

1

actually receive less than the full amount that the jury

2

is assessing.

3

QUESTION:

That would be a matter of State law.

4

MR. McALLISTER:

That would be generally a

5

matter of State law, where you're talking about State tort

6

actions, how the jury is instructed in terms of those tax

7

consequences, that's correct.

8

The United States -- and to go back to Justice

9

Scalia's point about interpreting the statute as a whole,

10

the United States suggests that the title that goes with

11

the statute, compensation for injuries or sickness,

12

suggests a more limited or narrower scope.

13

with that argument is that title was not present in 1918,

14

and there's no suggestion that there was any debate by

15

Congress when that title was added as part of apparently

16

the codification process that they were in any sense

17

altering or changing the original scope of the statute.

18

The problem

The operative language has remained the same

19

from 1918 onward.

What has happened, though, is the tax

20

laws were codified in what was originally one sentence,

21

drawing the distinction between accident or health

22

insurance benefits and Worker's Comp benefits on the one

23

hand received as compensation and any damages received on

24

account of personal injuries.

25

somewhat obscured by the breaking down of it into three --

That distinction has been

2

what is now three separate provisions in the tax code,
(a) (1) ,

QUESTION:

3
4

Well, it goes on to (a)(5) at this

point, doesn't it?
MR. MCALLISTER:

5
6

(a) (2) , and (a) (3) .

It does go on to (a)(5), Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

7

What do you make of the textual

8

argument, or the textual distinction?

9

22 of the Government's brief, which quotes some of the

10

I'm looking at page

other subsections.
(a)(1) provides an exclusion for certain sums as

11
12

compensation for personal injuries or sickness.

13

refers, again, to certain sums received for personal

14

injuries and sickness.

15

and that suggests that the specific dollar amounts that

16

they're referring to are those which are attributable to

17

the sickness or the injury, as distinct from something

18

else.

19

Your

The (3)

(4) again uses the for language,

subsection (2) uses the phrase, on account

20

of, which would suggest, by contrast, a broader meaning.

21

Which --we seem to have a choice, I guess, of statutory

22

interpretation rules.

23

distinction presumably is intended to enact a difference,

24

or we could say, well, on account of is not entirely clear

25

and we ought to use the criterion of noscitur a sociis.

We could either say, well, the

1

If we want to know what this one means, which is not

2

clear, look to what it's companion provisions mean which

3

are clear.

4

assessing the contrast in the language?

Which of those two criteria should we adopt in

MR. MCALLISTER:

5

Well, Your Honor, it's

6

certainly our view that you should look primarily at the

7

language of (a)(2) itself, which on its face suggests a

8

broader interpretation -- any damages received on account

9

of.

It would have been extraordinarily easy for Congress

10

to have said, as compensation, which it did with the rest

11

of that statute when it first enacted it.
So that yes, the companions around that

12

13

provision perhaps do suggest a narrower focus, but

14

certainly in the original provision, and the substantive

15

language itself has not changed, a broader construction is

16

suggested.

17

And again, without going back through the

18

history, when you simply look at these provisions today,

19

that one sits in the middle of all these other what appear

20

to be purely compensatory provisions, but our view is, you

21

cannot fully understand that provision or give full effect

22

to its language without looking back to the history of it

23

and following through how it has come through the first

24

codification, the recodification, and how it ended up

25

where it is today.

QUESTION:

1

So you think the history has more

2

significance than just the contrast in the language

3

reading the statute, as Justice Scalia would, as a whole

4

today?
MR. MCALLISTER:

5

I think both are important in

6

the sense that the history is certainly relevant, but to

7

the extent that provision indicates a different scope than

8

the others, this Court should give effect to that

9

different scope, because -QUESTION:

10

Mr. McAllister, what about the ground

12

income except, and exceptions are to be narrowly

13

construed?

14

MR. MCALLISTER:

Everything is

Your Honor, we recognize that

15

that principle is there.

In our view, the way to deal

16

with that is that the Court should look at the language

17

itself, and look at the history, and we believe when you

18

do that, that the language is no longer so ambiguous, so

19

that it is not a choice of two interpretations competing,

20

which we simply have no way to choose between one and the

21

other.

22

In fact, the history strongly suggests that one

23

interpretation is the correct interpretation, the broader

24

interpretation, but I do recognize the existence of that

25

default rule as it's been characterized at times.

1

But we're suggesting that when you look at all

2

of the surrounding evidence here, the things that Justice

3

Souter has talked about, the contrast in the language, the

4

history of the provision, where it came from, and how it

5

got to be where it is today, that really only one

6

conclusion makes sense here, or at least is the stronger

7

conclusion.

8

QUESTION:

There's no default, is your position.

9

MR. McALLISTER:

That's basically -- there

10

should not be a default in this instance, because there's

11

not a situation where you simply cannot tell which is the

12

better view based on what evidence is available to this

13

Court, and in fact again, Congress in 1989 essentially

14

declared its understanding, and we're not suggesting, as

15

an ambiguity in an exemption, it should be read in favor

That holding applies directly to

The text of the statute provides an exclusion

from income only for damages awarded on account of the

personal injury.

9

connection with a personal injury.

10
11

It does not, as petitioners contend,

Indeed, that precise

contention was rejected by this Court in Schleier.
In Schleier, the Court said that whether the

12

underlying cause of action is on account of, or rather,

13

whether the damages are received in connection with an

14

underlying cause of action that is a tort-type action for

15

personal injuries is not, in the words of the Court, the

16

beginning and end of the analysis.

17

Instead, as the Court emphasized in Schleier,

18

each element of the recovery must be on account of the

19

personal injury for the statutory exclusion to apply.

20

Only damages that compensate for a loss and are

21

attributable to it are on account of the injury within the

22

meaning of the statute.

23

in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass, damages for personal

24

injury are by definition compensatory only, and do not

25

include punitive and other ancillary recoveries.

applications of the statute in this context.

The Court in

Schleier did not doubt that age discrimination effects

4

personal injuries to the victims of the discrimination,

5

but the Court pointed out that the two remedies provided

6

by statute for that discrimination, back wages and

7

liquidated damages for willful violations of the act, did

8

not compensate for those personal injuries, were not

9

attributable to those injuries.

They therefore were not

10

on account of those injuries within the meaning of the

11

statute.
The -- in -- sorry, I've obviously lost my train

12

13

of thought.

14

Because the damages are not awarded on account

15

of the injury, they're not within the scope of the

16

statutory exclusion from income which, as this Court has

17

said on many occasions, must be narrowly interpreted and

18

applied.

19

Now, punitive damages in the decisions of this

20

Court have never been held to be compensation, and they

21

are not awarded on account of an injury.

22

damages, as this Court has often said, are a civil fine

awarded to punish and to deter reprehensible conduct, they

are not compensation for the injury itself, and I think

but a jury may consider the amount of actual damages in

2

deciding what punitive damages are appropriate to

3

accomplish the State's independent objectives of punishing

4

and deterring the conduct.
As the Fifth Circuit said just last year in

5
6

Estate of Moore v. Commissioner, which is not cited in our

7

brief but which I've mentioned to petitioner's counsel --

8

it's at 53 F.3d at 716 -- what the Fifth Circuit said in

9

Estate of Moore is that this fact does not make a punitive

10

award a compensatory one.

11

It does not, as the court said in that case,

12

change the fundamental truth that punitive damages are

13

awarded only on account of and in proportion to the

14

defendant's wrongful conduct.

15

but one of the courts of appeals have concluded that

16

punitive damages being awarded on account of the

17

reprehensible conduct and not as compensation to the

18

injuries do not come within the statutory exclusion.

Thus, that court and all

In Schleier we also said that whether

one treats respondents attaining the age of 60, or his

being laid off on account of his age, as the proximate

cause of respondent's loss of income, neither the birthday

nor the discharge can fairly be described as a personal

fundamental misstatement of counsel on this issue.

Having

2

heard his argument, I would get the impression that most

3

courts had interpreted the '89 amendment to help their

4

case.

5

In fact, all but one of the courts of appeals

6

have said about this 1989 amendment almost exactly what

7

I've just said to the Court, that it doesn't address this

8

issue, it addresses a different issue, it consciously

9

addressed a narrow issue, and consciously left this other

10

issue untouched, just as Congress did in the '96

11

amendment, where they prospectively authoritatively

12

determined punitive damages are not within the statutory

13

exclusion, which really brings me to my last point.

In our view, and in the view of the tax court in

MR. JONES:

I think the footnote in Burke was

that the statute of limitations for suits to recover an

2

erroneous refund expired before this suit was brought by

3

the Government.

4

First, petitioners don't dispute that they did not raise

5

this issue in the district court, and when they raised it

6

in the court of appeals, they did so solely on the theory

7

that a failure to comply with the statute of limitations

8

would deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction.

9

That contention is wrong for two reasons.

Now, as we state in our brief, and as

10

petitioners do not address at all, this is an ordinary

11

type of statute of limitations that limits only the

12

recovery on the claim.

13

of the court.

14

It does not limit the jurisdiction

Thus, even if the statute of limitations had not

15

been complied with, this Court would have jurisdiction,

16

the lower courts would have jurisdiction, and such a

17

holding would therefore have no remedial significance.

18

They can't raise at this point a suggestion that

19

the failure to comply with the statute was an affirmative

20

defense, because they waived the issue by not raising it

21

in the district court.

the Court, because this relates only to subject matter

Do you agree that if we don't hold

the statute jurisdictional that you have waived it?
MR. MCALLISTER:

No, I don't, Your Honor.

I

The Tenth Circuit addressed it on the merits, and under

20

this Court's rules the Government had an obligation to

21

object to any procedural problem in its response to our

22

petition for writ of certiorari.

23

It did not do so, so I believe in effect it has

24

waived any objection, and this Court now, under its

25

precedents, is entitled to reach that issue on the merits,

MR. McALLISTER:

11

The amount was refunded on

July 9.

13

the check was received, but it didn't say that the refund

14

was made, and in our view making should refer to the last

15

act basically the Government needs to perform to complete

16

the process, which was after it's issued the check, put it

in the mail to the taxpayer.

What that meant was that was the date on which
