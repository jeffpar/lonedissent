ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEITH ZAKARIN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ZAKARIN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The task before the Court in this case is to now

11
12

make explicit what East River requires but necessarily

13

left implicit, a definition of the product itself which is

14

true to the principles of East River and is capable of

15

uniform application by the Federal courts sitting in

16

admiralty.

17

The product itself is the thing sold by the

18

original seller or manufacturer to the original buyer of

19

that thing.

20

only be recovered in contract.

21

Property destroyed by the defect which is not the product

22

itself is recoverable in tort.

23

final opinion, the last of three, has damaged that

24

balance, and that balance must now be set aright.

25

If that product self-destructs, its loss can

1

contract suit to recover also damages for property that it

2

is clear would be at risk if the item sold were destroyed?

3

MR. ZAKARIN:

4

QUESTION:

5

not, under a contract theory?

6

Justice O'Connor --

I mean, there's some leeway, is there

MR. ZAKARIN:

Justice O'Connor, that depends, of

7

course, upon the existence both of privity and the scope

8

of the contract at issue.

9

and there may or may not be recovery.

There may or may not be privity
Nevertheless, the

10

principles which drive the existence of strict liability,

11

the necessity to make manufacturers responsible to produce

12

safe goods put into the stream of commerce, counsel a

13

broader interpretation of recovery.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but even in the East River

15

situation where you're dealing with commercial sellers, if

16

you would -- you may not want to concede that, but

17

assuming we're dealing with a commercial seller and a

18

commercial buyer, does East River indicate that a contract

19

recovery, if it were available for these other things,

20

should be applied?

21

MR. ZAKARIN:

Ordinarily, the answer is -- the

22

answer is that East River is silent as to the recovery in

23

a particular contract of those items.

24

Hadley v. Baxendale and cases in particular State

25

jurisdictions, that a contract could permit broader

1

recovery than for the item itself, governed, of course, by

2

the doctrine of foreseeability.

3

Nevertheless, East River speaks to a limitation

4

and a balance between tort and contract which permit tort

5

recovery for those other items where contract does not

6

permit it.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, do you think East River meant

to not go as far as, say, Hadley v. Baxendale would?

9

MR. ZAKARIN:

The standards for recovery of

10

damages are different in tort and in contract, and I do

11

not believe that East River necessarily sets those

12

parameters.

13

recovery in contract will be governed by foreseeability as

14

to those items governed by contract, the product itself.
QUESTION:

15
16

East River does say quite correctly that

That's Hadley v. Baxendale, too, is

it not?

17

MR. ZAKARIN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ZAKARIN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

That's the rule.
But that is, of course, the

20

measure of contract recovery and not of tort recovery.

21

Tort recovery is necessarily those things -- those damages

22

proximately caused by the defect.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

In this case --

Which is a more relaxed standard of

foreseeability, is it not?
MR. ZAKARIN:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it is

1

indeed, but that relaxed standard is important in the area

2

of unreasonably dangerous and defective products, since

3

the manufacturer may not always be able to foresee, unlike

4

a contracting party, the scope of damage that its product

5

may cause.
QUESTION:

6

Should it matter at all, for purposes

7

of our analysis, that when the ship was sold it was

8

incomplete for the purpose for which it was sold, and

9

which it was understood that everyone was going to use it

10

for, so that the ship was kind of -- in a way, it was sort

11

of a component that really wouldn't be of any use to tuna

12

fishing until it was outfitted with a substantial amount

13

of further equipment.

14

case?

15

MR. ZAKARIN:

Should that affect our view of the

No, Justice Souter, it should not.

16

The product as it left the Martinac Shipyard with the

17

Marco hydraulic system aboard was a fully complete ship,

18

admittedly not complete for the purpose it had eventually

19

been intended, tuna purse seine fishing, but she was

20

capable of sailing away, and did sail away.

21

Were that distinction of a changing product

22

adopted by the Court, the balance given to us by East

23

River -- that is that the object of the bargain between

24

the original manufacturer and/or seller, as it were, and

25

the original buyer would be disturbed -- the product would

1

change as each went on, and the original focus upon the

2

object of the contract would become diluted over time.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Zakarin, I'm not clear as to

4

whether what East River is saying is that the manufacturer

5

has the opportunity to protect himself against tort

6

liability and, therefore, if he doesn't he should be

7

socked, or rather is saying that the purchaser has an

8

opportunity to protect itself against injury through
contract and, therefore, if he doesn't do so the purchaser

10

should not be given the tort recovery.
Now, if East River is looking to the purchaser

11
12

and saying look, the purchaser could have put this in the

13

contract, then logically we ought to look to the second

14

contract and not to the first contract, whereas if East

15

River is looking to the seller, then you're quite correct,

16

we ought to look at the first contract.

17

But why do you say that East River focuses on

18

the seller rather than the purchaser?

1

them can protect themselves.

20

in this last transaction if the purchaser wanted to be

21

able to recover for all of the incidentals besides the

22

tuna, he could have put it in the contract.

23

it.

24
25

I mean, each of

Why shouldn't we say, look,

He didn't do

Tough luck.
MR. ZAKARIN:

There are two reasons, Justice

Scalia, why that would be the wrong focus.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)28 -2260
(800) FOR DEPO

For one thing,

1

East River is not a singular focus upon the ability of the

2

manufacturer, as you correctly point out, to protect

3

itself, but it also looks to, as you also correctly point

4

out, the buyer's ability to negotiate for additional

5

warranties and the like, and that balance is respected in

6

East River.
However, if that object of the contract is -- if

7
8

we look to subsequent sales, the object of that contract

9

becomes ignored.

Therefore, looking at the downstream

10

sales and looking at what protections the purchasers in

11

those sales made or didn't make is an unrelated

12

proposition to the balance in East River between the

13

original purchaser and the original buyer.

14

But there's another reason, which is that --

15

QUESTION:

Well, excuse me.

I'm not sure what

16

point you're making.

Are you making the point that the

17

immunity that the manufacturer had acquired for itself by

18

the contract could be undone by a later reseller?

19

the point?
No, Your Honor.

Is that

20

MR. ZAKARIN:

Under the --

QUESTION:

22

MR. ZAKARIN:

the point I am making.

24

immunity for the product sold.

25

expanded, the expansion of that immunity bears no relation

No?
Well, that is the point -- that is
The original purchase provides an
If that immunity is

1

to the original object of the contract and is in effect a

2

windfall for that manufacturer for immunity it never

3

bargained for, never was paid for, and never discussed.

4

But looking beyond that, East River is not a

5

singular focus upon contract but also recognizes the

6

important necessities driving the tort system, which is

7

the place of proper encouragement upon manufacturers to

8

foresee, spread, and control the risk.
QUESTION:

9

If --

Why not upon purchasers?

I mean, you

10

know, they're both in this together, and we're only

11

dealing with situations in which they're -- it's arm's

12

length between people of comparable bargaining power.

13

We're not talking about the purchase of a bottle of pop in

Well, can I ask about the

circumstances of this sale?

of the boat from the original purchaser of the boat,

And could Saratoga Fishing have asked

MR. ZAKARIN:
QUESTION:

10

Of course it could have.

And apparently it didn't, and made

the sale on an as-is basis.

12

MR. ZAKARIN:

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

for certain warranties at the time it bought from Madruga?

9

11

Your client, Saratoga, bought

That is correct.

Are there any implied warranties from

Madruga in the case of an as-is basis sale?

15

MR. ZAKARIN:

I would believe not.

No

16

contractual warranties, it is admitted, were extended,

17

granted, or received by Captain Vargas through Saratoga

Fishing Company.

QUESTION:

Does the record tell us whether

Saratoga had insurance for loss of the boat?

insurance in the record.

price as a result of not requiring warranties and thought

2

it could do so -- protect itself more cheaply by just

3

getting insurance.

4

MR. ZAKARIN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ZAKARIN:

Of course.

Yes.
The existence -- the existence of

7

an as-is sale in a downstream transaction, which is as-

8

is, where-is, is not hostile to the balance struck in East

9

River of holding manufacturers strictly liable for

10

unreasonably dangerous defects.
QUESTION:

11

Well, I thought the East River

12

represented, as has been suggested in other questions this

13

morning, a choice that in the commercial context we will

14

focus on a contract remedy because the commercial buyer is

15

able to protect itself by demanding warranties if it sees

16

fit.

17

MR. ZAKARIN:

That is only, Justice O'Connor, if

18

we allow the focus of the bargain to shift with each

19

subsequent sale.

East River, again, is not a singular --

balance between contract and tort.

engine, and then the engine goes in the boat, and then the

2

boat is resold, all right.

3

if it's a defective screw that blows up, and it blows up

4

the engine, that you can't recover in tort for the engine

That's the defective product.

Is that right?

The screw --

QUESTION:

9

Everybody I think agrees that

Well, suppose you have a screw that's

10

defective, and it's in an engine, and the engine blows up

11

because of the screw.
MR. ZAKARIN:

12

13

original engine?

16

And the screw is part of the

QUESTION:

That's what I'm getting at.

What's

original?
You see, I mean, what you had was a screw that

17

was sold to an engine-builder that was sold to a

18

shipbuilder that was sold to another captain.

19

about the defective product, and then the downstream

20

things from the defective product.

21

opponents are arguing is that this resold ship is the

defective product.

2

that.
So what I want to know is, what's the line?

3

What's the English words that would describe a

4

circumstance so that we all agree that engine in my

5

hypothetical case with the screw is the defective product

6

but your resold ship is not the defective product?

7

words in English, or what line of law clearly defines

8

those two, making the one the defective product but not

9

the other, because I think you have to find that line in

10

order to win the case.

11

MR. ZAKARIN:

What

I quite agree, Justice Breyer,

12

that the -- in English,

13

completed product as first placed into the stream of

14

commerce in a commercial sale would be the product --

15

QUESTION:

the rule would be that the

Yes, but why isn't it the screw?

The

16

screw entered the scream of -- the screw entered the

17

stream of commerce in the defect -- so that doesn't work,

18

so that would then mean that the engine wouldn't be the

19

defective product, but we all agree it is.

20

MR. ZAKARIN:

As I understood your hypothetical,

21

the screws as sold to the first buyer was in an engine

22

contained in a ship which all went in a completed product

23

to the first buyer.

QUESTION:

25

MR. ZAKARIN:

That's the Shipco case out of the

Fifth Circuit.
QUESTION:

That would be the case where the

4

engine manufacturer produces his own screws.

5

is unusual.

6

I guess that

I think Justice Breyer was giving you the case

7

where there are screws in the engine, but the engine

8

manufacturer gets the screw from, you know --

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

-- Screws Unlimited or something, the

11

screw manufacturer.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. ZAKARIN:

That's right.

That's right.

14

That, indeed, is both in microcosm and in gross the East

15

River case and the Shipco case out of the Fifth Circuit.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. ZAKARIN:

18

QUESTION:

But that is East River, is it not?
East River --

That what caused the damage there was

19

a defective component that East River didn't produce but

20

incorporated in the equipment that was sold.

21

MR. ZAKARIN:

22

QUESTION:

That'S correct.

And aren't the cases pretty much

23

uniform in saying you look at the product that was sold

24

the first time, the whole entity, not at the component

25

parts that may have been produced by someone else?

Then why isn't what your

MR. ZAKARIN:

QUESTION:

Because --

Because all that happened was that

the -- they simply added a few nets and things, just as

the engine manufacturer added some metal to the screw,

just as the shipbuilder added some wood to the engine, and

the nets, and then Madruga just sailed it off and put the
skiff on and the nets.

Would the skiff and the nets then

be part of the whole product in the case that I put?

for a part that they had put in the engine, and that was a

Fifth Circuit stopped it cold and said no, it is the

5

negotiated, final, complete product that left that

6

particular shipyard which is the product itself, and there

7

was no property in that particular case outside of that.
QUESTION:

8

So I guess you're saying in answer to

9

Justice Scalia's first question way back earlier on in the

10

argument -- I think you're saying that the capacity of the

11

end user to contract is basically irrelevant.

12

simply got to be a conventional line, and the conventional

13

line which would work as well as any other is the one that

14

we've already given at least some lip service to, and

that's the 402A line.

And you're saying that the capacity of that end

protection when he buys whatever the thing is he buys is

7

essentially irrelevant.

9

MR. ZAKARIN:

It is indeed irrelevant for this

purpose, because strict liability in its balance in

contract as given by East River takes account of both.

11

looks at the original purchaser's ability to contract with

the manufacturer, what warranties might exist.

MR. ZAKARIN:

The original purchaser can protect

as to the original purchaser, but cannot protect itself

against tort liability for damage to other property,

MR. ZAKARIN:

possible in the hands of the first purchaser, vis-a-vis a

that the analysis in the hands of Mr. Madruga would be the

Yes, Your Honor.

I would suggest

that the test is the benefit of the bargain, and in order

Mr. Macleod, I didn't understand your

2

answer to Justice Scalia, because I didn't understand you

3

to be contesting that if Vargas, the second purchaser,

4

bought all new equipment, a new seine, a new boat, that

5

would be other property, would it not, for which the

6

manufacturer would be liable?

7

MR. MACLEOD:

QUESTION:

9

MR. MACLEOD:

I would -- no, Your Honor.

No?
I'm suggesting that replacement

property is not recoverable as other property, where parts

of the ship wear out and are replaced or -- and modified

think it would be great to have a second skiff, during the

period in which the adder of the second skiff owned the

If he had come along and said, I

Isn't

that correct on your theory?
MR. MACLEOD:

Yes.

In fact, in the present case

the property of other crewmen that was aboard the vessel

loophole in that protection, I take it, is in the period

between the time -- between sales.

3

Let's say, the period between the sale to the

4

second buyer, who then adds not just replacement equipment

but adds equipment to it like the second skiff.

6

that period the manufacturer has gotten other property

liability if the second skiff gets blown up along with the

ship, but if you're lucky, and the second skiff and the

hook again.

11

Is that the way your theory works?

MR. MACLEOD:

Yes, Your Honor, except that in

13

the hands of the second purchaser I think the analysis

14

should be of the bargain made by that purchaser.

15

QUESTION:

Well, he bought a ship without a

16

second skiff.

17

second skiff is not subject to the bargain that he made

18

when he purchased the ship, so I thought on your theory

19

the second skiff is other property during that second

20

owner's ownership, but when the second owner then sells to

21

a third, and the second skiff goes with it, then the

22

second skiff is part of the bargain.

23

includes the second skiff, and there wouldn't be product

liability vis-a-vis the original manufacturer.

QUESTION:

As a matter of contract law.

from the manufacturer the extent to which the warranty
covered what would have been other property in Madruga's

MR. MACLEOD:

I believe that the proper analysis

of the relationship between Mr. Madruga and the
shipbuilder at that point would be made under contract and
warranty law with an examination of that particular
contract and, if my memory serves me correctly, it would
not be recoverable in this case because of a time limit on
warranties.

by the warranty anyway, because it's other property.

The approach that was taken to the

But if -- I wondered if -- what's

bothering me basically is, I thought East River's like
this:

there's a glass on the table in the galley, and

it's defective, and it cracks and breaks and people are
cut, and there's a good claim that of course all these cut
people can recover in tort, and then somebody says I also
want tort recovery for the glass itself.
You say, wait a minute.

When you have a

defective glass you don't get the value of the glass in
tort.

I mean, it's the glass that was defective.

Recover

in contract or warranty for the defective glass.
And now that principle, which seems right in
that case, seems to have gotten way out of control.

I

mean, now suddenly we're talking about they have to
recover in contract.

They can't get a tort recovery for

the fish that are hurt, and they -- all these other
things.
It doesn't seem right that it's so far out of
control, but I'm having trouble thinking of what the
limiting principle is.
It doesn't seem right to me when you buy a ship,
under all these other appurtenance things there's a little
bit of a glass or something somewhere that breaks.

You

say you can't get recovery in tort for all these other
things that have nothing to do with the glass.

have accepted that even out of a contract context there

QUESTION:

Contract law -- yes, Your Honor.

All right, and that's why, as I

4

understand it, you don't have a category -- you don't make

5

any categorical distinction between property loss and

6

personal injury because in the case that I was giving you

7

before you said, well, if the second skiff is injured as a

8

result of the products defect while the product is owned

by the person who bought the second skiff, the second

skiff would be other property and would be recoverable.

Isn't that right?
