We are here today

concept of ordered liberty

The Washington statute prohibiting

19

assisted suicide was forged at the common law,

20

tempered by centuries of legal traditions and

21

ratified by recent legislative action and by a

22

direct vote of the people of Washington.

23

same prohibition has been enacted by the

24

legislatures of virtually every state and the

--

Mr.

Chief Justice,

I believe the

were implicated in the Cruzan case are implicated
here but more strongly,

because in the context of

withdrawing life support and in the
physician-assisted suicide there are some
different factual

--

QUESTION:

But in Cruzan what we were

dealing with was a state rule that said you had
to prove a certain thing by clear and convincing
evidence.

Here we're not dealing with any sort

of "an evidentiary rule,

we're dealing with an

outright prohibition.

TUCKER:

We also have the problem,

of the quite well-established and

understood underground practice of physician aid
in dying and that that is available primarily to
the educated and the affluent who can access a
physician to provide in that assistance.
QUESTION:

May I go back to the

reference in your answer to Justice O'Connor to
the political process not working.

It seems to

me that in the prior cases in which we have
spoken of the political process being imperfect,
it has been imperfect for exactly the reasons
suggested by her question.

And that is,

there

were certain groups who simply did not get a
representative fair shake for whatever reason.
That's not what we've got here.

The

premise of her question I thought was,

in any

case I'll make it the premise of mine,

is that

everybody is in the same boat.

And,

if,

in fact,

you are right about the pervasiveness of the
denial of death,
way we are.
