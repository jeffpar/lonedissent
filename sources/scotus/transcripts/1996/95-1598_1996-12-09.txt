ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANDRA D. HOWARD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. HOWARD:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
During the past decade, Oklahoma, like many

11
12

other States, has experienced a serious prison

13

overcrowding problem.

14

crisis, and at the same time to meet the goals of

15

incarceration, the Oklahoma legislature has had to come up

16

with some innovative programs.

17

program at issue here today, the pre-parole conditional

18

supervision program.

In an attempt to deal with this

One such program is the

Ernest Harper was placed on this program after

19
20

serving 14 years of a life sentence for first degree

21

murder.

22

when the Governor of Oklahoma denied his parole.

23

He was reclassified to a higher security level

The Tenth Circuit found that because Mr. Harper

24

had been serving his sentence outside the physical

25

boundaries of a prison, that his program was like parole,

1

and that he was entitled to the full protections of a

2

Morrissey v. Brewer hearing before reclassification.

3

We believe the Tenth Circuit erred in one major

4

reason.

5

nature of the program.

6

the program was really very simple.

7

found that because this was a program in which a prisoner

8

was serving his sentence outside the four walls of the

9

prison, that it was like parole.

10
11

The Tenth Circuit failed to consider the true
The Tenth Circuit's approach to
The Tenth Circuit

It is really very

different from parole in several respects.
First, I think what we need to do is look at the

12

nature of the program.

13

you had told us that previously in Meachum v. Fano and

14

other cases, and when we look at the nature of the

15

program, we have to consider several things.

16

You told us that in Sandin, and

First, we have to consider the purpose for which

17

the program was instituted.

18

function of the program, how it operates within the State,

19

and this program, unlike parole, does not function as a

20

program to reintegrate people into society.

21

as a program to alleviate prison overcrowding.

22

QUESTION:

We have to consider the

It functions

Ms. Howard, did the State have any

23

procedures in effect at the time this case arose for a

24

situation like this where one group permitted the pre­

25

parole but then the Governor subsequently denied parole?

Were there any written procedures in place for that

situation - -

MS. HOWARD:

QUESTION:

5

MS. HOWARD:

There --- when this case occurred?
There were some written procedures

at that time.

reclassifying somebody in the particular situation that

8

Mr. Harper was in.

9
10

They did not deal specifically for

QUESTION:

anything that covered this case.

11

MS. HOWARD:

12

QUESTION:

13

So the answer is there wasn't

Nothing specific.
And subsequently the State has

adopted some procedures?

14

MS. HOWARD:

Several procedures have been

15

adopted by our Pardon and Parole Board since that time,

16

and in 1991, after the time Mr. Harper was already brought

17

back onto the program, our Pardon and Parole Board adopted

18

a policy where they now leave people out for 90 days

19

before reexamining them and determining whether to

20

bring --

21

QUESTION:

And then it's discretionary with the

22

board whether to terminate it, the pre-parole, simply

23

because the Governor had denied parole?

24
25

MS. HOWARD:

Actually, it's a determination made

by our Department of Corrections, which is somewhat

confusing in this case.
The Pardon and Parole Board recommends people

2

3

for pre-parole to our Department of Corrections, and the

4

Department of Corrections makes the ultimate decision

5

about - -

6

7

QUESTION:
that decision?

Is it just totally discretionary --

8

MS. HOWARD:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

And on what basis do they now make

Yes, it's --- with the Department, or do they

consider how the prisoner has behaved on pre-parole?
MS. HOWARD:

It is totally discretionary with

12

the Department, and they derive their authority from this

13

Court's opinion in Meachum v. Fano.

QUESTION:

15

MS . HOWARD:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19
20

Well, can they flip a coin?
Yes, they can.
Under Oklahoma law you would advise

the board that they can flip a coin?
MS. HOWARD:

I would advise that that would be

permissible in this situation.
QUESTION:

So there -- you then take it that the

21

claim before us today doesn't carry a substantive

22

component to it?

23

MS. HOWARD:

24

QUESTION:

25

No.
That you go through the motions of a

hearing, but then they can flip a coin.

And that gives them due process.
Right.

I'm not --

Is that right?
Well, I'm not discounting any type

of claim, a First Amendment violation or an Eighth

7

Amendment violation, if there were an independent

constitutional violation.

We're not saying that they can

or, you know, on the basis of race, but other than that,

11

other than some independent constitutional violation --

QUESTION:

Well, flipping a --

13

QUESTION:

But what was it in the regulations or

14

the statute at the time that this took place that said

15

that pre-parole can be revoked upon the Governor's

16

refusing a pardon?

17

MS. HOWARD:

Again, there's nothing specific in

18

the statute.

19

implements the program, and it indicates that people on

20

that program are inmates within the Department of

21

Corrections.

22

What we do have, we have a statute which

It indicates that they are subject to escape

23

charges if they don't report back from the program.

24

indicates also that they're subject to the disciplinary

25

proceedings of the Department of Corrections.

It

From that

1

we assume, or we know, that this is a type of

2

classification within the Department of Corrections under

3

Meachum v. Fano.

4

QUESTION:

But Mr. Harper was asked at the time

5

he was put in this program, he was asked to sign a form,

6

and I'm looking at page 5 of the joint appendix.

7

MS. HOWARD:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.
And that form says, reviewed options

available in the event of parole denial, and he signs it,

10

and I guess somebody from the Department of Corrections

11

signs it.

12

reviewed with him that would be available in the event of

13

parole denial?

14

Well, what were those options that were

MS. HOWARD:

At the end, we don't have anything

15

specific in our regulations saying what those options

16

were.

17

that time it was automatic, that if the Governor denied

18

parole they automatically reclassified --

19
20
21

I'm told by the Department of Corrections that at

QUESTION:

So this was a misrepresentation on

the form that they asked him to sign?
MS. HOWARD:

It said options?

Well, we don't know for sure if

22

those options are only limited to -- to two options of

23

either being brought back in or being stayed out.

24

could be other options that are not directly related to

25

the specific decision about whether to reclassify or not,

Well, was staying out, as you put it,

At that time it was not.

It is

At that time it was not.
QUESTION:

6

In fact, as I understand it, some of

7

these individuals who were denied parole were brought back

8

like this particular prisoner, and some were not, is that

9

correct?

10

MS. HOWARD:

11

QUESTION:

12

13

At the time -Not all of them have been brought

back.
MS. HOWARD:

At the time that Mr. Harper was

14

brought back, everyone in his similar situation was

15

brought back in.

MS. HOWARD:

18

QUESTION:

Well --

19

QUESTION:

You mean there were no options, then?

20

MS. HOWARD:

21

But that's not the case now?
That is not the case now.

Well, there were no options as far

as, if you consider the options stay out or come in.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. HOWARD:

What other options would there be?
Well, like you, I'm somewhat

24

troubled by that language, that I think perhaps it could

25

refer to other types of options once he's back within the

behind the change, or - QUESTION:

the State statute?
MS. HOWARD:

There has been no change in the

MS. HOWARD:

It's a matter of administrative

policy, which is really my point here, the point we're

trying to make in this case.

Well, before you go on to that, how

is the decision being made today as to whether he - - a

MS. HOWARD:

Again, there are no specific

QUESTION:

Well -One - If it's not flipping a coin, wouldn't

a hearing with an opportunity to appear and give reasons

22

why one should be brought back or not brought back

23

function as a normal due process hearing would function?

24
25

MS. HOWARD:

It might would function as that,

but I think the question here is whether there's a liberty

But in any case,

MS. HOWARD:

there would be the same function for

There would be an opportunity to

That's fair to say,

is

There would be an argument -- there

11

would be - - under Meachum v. Fano I keep coming back to,

12

but that case discussed the fact that when you're dealing

13

with classification systems like this one is, that there's

14

no - - that there's no right to participate in the decision

15

of whether or not to reclassify.

16

QUESTION:

It's purely --

Well, but this is a question which

17

involves not only a reclassification, but a revocation of

18

liberty, and Morrissey and Brewer says expressly, whatever

19

you call it, by whatever name,

20

interest which deserves a hearing before it is revoked, so

21

I don't see why you don't fall within the terms of

22

Morrissey, because you have a)

23

discretionary decision about whether to revoke it or not.

24
25

MS. HOWARD:

the liberty in fact is an

we do really fall under Morrissey, and there are

several - -

3

QUESTION:

Well, you fall within the language

4

that I just referred to.

5

wouldn't you?
MS. HOWARD:

6

You would agree with that,

I would agree with that, but I

7

think we also -- and the Court talks about this in

8

Morrissey, is you have to look at the function of the

9

program.

10

QUESTION:

Well, yes.

I suppose also Morrissey

11

v. Brewer may have decided this -- described kind of a

12

generic parole.

13

different variations in the different States, and I gather

14

what your State is saying is that the Oklahoma system, at

15

least now and perhaps as it was when this respondent was

16

dealt with by it, was different from the ordinary system.

17

It didn't purport to account for all the

MS. HOWARD:

That's exactly the point I wanted

18

to make, Your Honor, that when Morrissey talked about

19

parole, Morrissey talked about the fact that parole had

20

been around for 60 years, it was a well-established part

21

of the penal system, and that --

22

QUESTION:

Well, suppose we decided here, at

23

least a majority were to conclude that it is most closely

24

analogous to parole, and therefore Morrissey is some --

25

it's applicable in some respect, do you think the system

1

the State now has in place would suffice if the ultimate

2

decision is arbitrarily decided?

3

MS. HOWARD:

The system they now -- the State

4

now has in place still does not entitle the inmate to a

5

hearing, so, you know, if this Court were to find that a

Morrissey - -

QUESTION:

8

MS. HOWARD:

9

QUESTION:
MS. HOWARD:

10

The new system does not -No.
-- give the inmate a hearing?
No, it does not.

It allows the

11

inmate to stay out for a certain time before the

12

Department of Corrections makes a decision to bring him

13

back in, but the new system does not entitle him to a

14

hearing.
QUESTION:

Morrissey were applicable, do you defend that system?

MS. HOWARD:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

And if this Court thought that

If this Court thought -If we thought that it was analogous

to parole.
MS. HOWARD:

If you thought that it was like

21

parole such that Morrissey applied, then I think we would

22

have a hard time defending that system.

23

QUESTION:

Well, you can't under our due proces

24

cases say that we have a particular scheme here, and it

doesn't call for a hearing, and therefore that's the end

for a hearing in the State system.

I mean, if the scheme calls for a determination of

MS. HOWARD:

I would agree with that, that first

you have to find a liberty interest.
QUESTION:

May I ask you, you said this is

8

different from parole, and you never quite explained why.

9

Would you tell me, from the standpoint of the person out

10

of jail, what's the difference?

11

MS. HOWARD:

12

13
14

I will answer that question and

then I'd like to also make a couple of other comments.
From the standpoint of someone out of jail, like
Mr. Harper --

15

QUESTION:

Right.

16

MS. HOWARD:

17

One, Mr. Harper is still bound by the prison

-- there are several differences.

18

disciplinary proceedings, so if he commits some sort of

19

disciplinary violation while he's out on pre-parole, just

20

something that would be a disciplinary misconduct in the

21

prison, like a disrespect to his supervising parole

22

officers, then he can be charged with a disciplinary

23

violation and earned credits can be taken away.

24
25

QUESTION:

And you don't think that Morrissey,

if he was disrespectful to his parole officer, could have

been disciplined?

2

MS. HOWARD:

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. HOWARD:

5

There's no provision for that.
I see.
Under parole, you're either revoked

or you're -- there are no provisions -QUESTION:

6

I see.

In other words, there's

7

discipline short of revocation.

8

MS. HOWARD:

9

QUESTION:
MS. HOWARD:

10

Exactly.
Okay.
Another important -- I think a real

11

important point to make is that prisoners on this pre-

12

parole conditional supervision program are earning earned

13

credits within our Department of Corrections.

14

call them good time credits.

15

you're placed on a certain level, and you may earn an

16

additional 44 days or 33 days or 22 days based on things

17

like the management of your living space and hygiene,

18

participation in an education program, or a job --

19

QUESTION:

20

shortening the release date?

21

MS . HOWARD:

22

QUESTION:

23

We have a system where

These are good time credits

Right.
Well, can't a person on parole earn

those, too?

QUESTION:

1

I would take it - - correct me if I'm

2

wrong -- that a parolee is subject to a certain amount of

increased restrictions if he seems to be not quite

There may be additional options,

So then that distinction between your

12

pre-parolee respondent here and the parolee in the

13

standard parole case doesn't seem to hold up in your

14

answer to Justice Stevens.

15

MS. HOWARD:

Well, the distinction, I believe,

16

Justice Stevens was making earlier, that there are some

15

nature of a parolee's interest in his continued liberty.

16

The Court defined parole as follows:

17

parole is release from prison before completion of

18

sentence on condition that the prisoner abide by certain

19

rules during the balance of the sentence.

20

the essence of

The Court decided that even though the parolee's

21

liberty is only partial and conditional, nevertheless it

22

includes many of the core values of unconditional liberty.

the Attorney General gave it, and I don't think that the

Court of Criminal Appeals found either that there was an

What -- what -It simply didn't arise.

I've another question.

for this I'm assuming you're right that really the

standard was vague, and there are all kinds of reasons

reason they could revoke this.

To be quite specific, there are lots of things

called intermediate punishments involving half-way houses,

involving nights and weekends in prison, involving a whole

How do you distinguish the one from the other?

and to the grocery store, you know that you're not in

2

prison, and when you know that you're not in prison,

3

something very precious has happened, and it shouldn't be

4

taken away without a hearing.

5

That's what I would say, and I know when I'm in

a half-way house that I'm still in prison, and it may be

7

that when I have a -- and be electronically surveilled all

8

day, I know I'm not in - - I know that I am in prison,

9

because something of the essence of freedom is having a

10

choice to obey the rules or not, instead of because every

11

minute you're being electronically surveilled or

12

surveilled by a guard.

13

This is a man who knew that he wasn't in prison,

14

and that's why he's entitled to a hearing, for that reason

MISS WINTER:

2

Well, Chief Justice, it seems to

3

me that even if, in 1990, when Ernest Harper was let out

4

of prison, there was an unvarying practice of bringing

5

people back to jail when parole was denied by the

6

Governor, that wouldn't necessarily show that there was a

7

policy.

8

The evidence that their - - the evidence that

9

they think that they have discretion to do it is in the

10

later enacted regulations, and it may be that they felt

11

like bringing everybody back in last week and this week

12

they feel like leaving everybody out, but they've already

13

said it's the toss of a coin, and it seems to me that that

14

kind of reasoning shouldn't be determining the very

15

precious right that's at stake here.

QUESTION:

May I ask if there was a statutory

change during that 5-month period?
MISS WINTER:

7

There was a statutory change as

follows.

There is one -- And there was -- there's been a

9

couple of misstatements of the record that I would like to

10

clear up here, and I'm not sure of the significance of

11

this - QUESTION:

12

13

Before you do, will you tell me what

the statutory change was?

14

MISS WINTER:

It's one that says -- there's an

15

identical provision for both parolees and pre-parolees,

16

and I believe they were enacted at the same time, and that

17

provision says, if you don't keep up with the educational

18

and job requirements that we put on you as a condition,

19

you will become ineligible for parole, and that's the only

20

thing - -

21

QUESTION:

And does either the statute before or

22

after that amendment make any reference to the Governor's

23

denial of parole as a reason for terminating pre-parole?

MISS WINTER:

25

One other thing - -

No, neither before nor after.

But we do have this opinion of the

Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, is it?

MISS WINTER:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Which denied the respondent's writ of

in petitioner's case is the fact that he was not granted

parole by the Governor.

8

It is for this, not a

program.
10

So do we interpret that as meaning that the

11

criminal appeals court thought that not being granted

12

parole was a valid and sufficient reason for revocation of

13

pre-parole status, and that in this very case that was the

14

reason?

15

saying.

16

I mean, it seems to me what the Oklahoma court is

MISS WINTER:

I believe that what they're saying

is that it is -- they are --

QUESTION:

MISS WINTER:

What if we read it that way anyway?
May I -- I just want to make sure

that what they're saying is, you must be brought in, that

they did not understand it to mean that.

1

of the habeas petition in this very case is the fact that

2

he was not granted, eventually, parole by the Governor,

3

and it was for that reason that his status was revoked,

4

not for some disciplinary reason or some other reason.

MISS WINTER:

I believe that I misspoke

QUESTION:

Now, what if we interpret that -- not

9

a valid explanation of what the State law was at the time

10

What if we, this Court thinks that that constitutes

of this revocation?
MISS WINTER:

11

Then it seems to me that you

12

should find -- you should say that the State law denies

13

due process, and that people must have a hearing,

14

because --

15

QUESTION:

A hearing to do what, because I think

16

as -- first, there's no dispute on the fact that it wasn't

17

any disciplinary reason, right?

18

MISS WINTER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MISS WINTER:

21

QUESTION:

You concede --

Yes.

-- that the only reason given -Yes.

-- was that the Governor denied

parole, so there'd be no hearing to decide what was the

reason.

QUESTION:

then you want to have

Are you saying that as a result of

this pre-release, pre-parole scheme that the discretion

17

the Governor previously had, which I assume was

18

unreviewable, is now in some sense subject to a due

19

process requirement simply because he was on release

20

before the Governor made his discretionary decision?

21

that your argument?

22

MISS WINTER:

Is

No, not at all, Justice Souter,

because there's a huge difference between parole --

refusal to grant someone parole and bringing them back

a permissible reason, he should have the opportunity to

argue that in this case it shouldn't be permitted.

QUESTION:

it says the Governor's -- where it says, we believe such a

procedure gives an inmate sufficient notice when he is

placed on the program that he may be removed from it when

the Governor exercises his discretion.
