ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD S. SLOWES
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. SLOWES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari from

13

the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.

14

the laws of Minnesota and those of some 40 other States

15

that limit each candidate to one party designation on the

16

election ballot should be overridden by the desire of a

17

party to place on that ballot as its candidate someone who

18

is already on the ballot as a candidate of another party.

1

The issue is whether

In this case, Minnesota's law preventing

20

multiple party nominations prevented the respondent New

21

Party from placing on the Minnesota election ballot as its

22

candidate Representative Andy Dawkins, a Democratic-

23

Farmer- Labor legislator who was already on the ballot as

24

the DFL candidate.

candidate must file an affidavit of candidacy, and on the

16

affidavit of candidacy he must indicate his political

party.

MR. SLOWES:

Yes.
In this instance, Representative

Dawkins had filed an affidavit of candidacy for the

1

preventing that from happening?

2

MR. SLOWES:

The State interests are multiple,

3

Justice Stevens, and what they have to do with, a number

4

of issues that this Court has recognized as compelling

5

State interests, although we don't believe that the Court

6

has to conclude that they're compelling in this instance.

7

One of them is the concern that multiple party candidacies

8

can lead to voter confusion about how to effectively cast

9

your ballot.
When the name appears on the ballot numerous

10
11

times -- in fact, this recently happened in Connecticut in

12

one of their elections where fusion was used.

13

voters thought that they had to fill in every line where

14

the name appeared for the vote to count.

15
16

QUESTION:

Some of the

I guess you could have instructions

on the ballot telling people what to do in that event.

17

MR. SLOWES:

Justice O'Connor, in fact that's

18

kind of the narrow tailoring that the Eighth Circuit

19

suggested for that.

20

QUESTION:

We think -But that would be possible, I guess,

21

to have instructions along with a ballot that did permit

22

parties to name the same person as their candidate.

23
24
25

MR. SLOWES:

Yes, Your Honor, it would be

possible.
QUESTION:

Or, indeed, I suppose you could count

the vote whether you voted on one line, two lines, or

2

either, or both.

3

MR. SLOWES:

4

QUESTION:

5

Your Honor, that would -I - - it seems to me you have to be

pretty dense to be confused on this one.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. SLOWES:

Well, apparently some voters in

8

Connecticut were, Your Honor, and one of the issues in the

9

recount was how do you deal with the ballots where there

10
11

are multiple markings.
QUESTION:

Yes, but are we supposed to erase

12

from our mind that there is at least one State that has

13

had a lot of experience with fusion candidates, and

14

there's no large confusion.

15

whatever one might speculate about the lack of

16

intelligence of the voters, we do have the State of New

17

York, where this has gone on without huge confusion.

18

MR. SLOWES:

19

QUESTION:

20

It's not a major problem.

So

That's indeed the case, Your Honor.
New Yorkers are smarter, I think.

That's probably the answer.

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. SLOWES:

I think that I have to be careful,

23

if I'm going back to Minnesota, about making that

24

argument, Your Honor.

But I think a State can make a

judgment.

Indeed, there is that record in New York.

it's a singular record.

There is no indication from other
There's not a broad range of

How many States have these antifusion

There are approximately 40, Your

It's difficult to get a precise count, because

10

some of the statutes are ambiguous, and there aren't

11

rulings about them.

12

QUESTION:

13

But

And most of them have been in effect

how many years?

14

MR. SLOWES:

Roughly since the turn of the

15

century, Your Honor, so there's not a broad range of

16

empirical evidence, but there's also --

17

QUESTION:

What's your answer to the suggestion

18

that someone made here that, assuming somebody gets

1

confused and votes twice, all the State has to do is count

20

it once?

21

the voter confusion point?

22

Why isn't that the answer, the simple answer to

MR. SLOWES:

Because we can't be certain that

23

the ballot is going to be easily understandable in terms

24

of what they really intended to do.

25

QUESTION:

Well, if they marked -- if Joe Doaks

1

is running on two lines and they mark Joe Doaks on each

2

line, isn't it a fair inference that they want Doaks?

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

Don't you have to know what party

5

they voted for Doaks on in order to determine who gets on

6

the ballot without having to go through a petition process

7

the next time around, or not?

8

MR. SLOWES:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

MR. SLOWES:

Is there any minimum party size?
In the circumstances of this case,

which was a legislative election for a legislative seat --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SLOWES:

14

Justice Scalia --

Right.
-- the vote count has no effect on

the future party status.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SLOWES:

Okay.
Those -- only Statewide elections

17

count in Minnesota for major party status, so that's

18

really not an issue here.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but I take it the argument --

20

QUESTION:

But that argument would be a valid

21
22

argument in other elections, although not in this one?
MR. SLOWES:

If it were a Statewide election

23

there would be that issue, and then the State would have

24

the question of how are we going to appropriately deal

25

with this issue.

QUESTION:

1

But I take it the respondent's

2

argument would address a Statewide election if the

3

respondent prevails, would it not?

4

MR. SLOWES:

It -- they claim that it does not,

5

Your Honor, because there are three statutes that are --

6

affect fusion in Minnesota.

7

addresses that issue, but in terms of a Statewide

8

election, the statutes that are at issue here would apply

9

to Statewide elections as well, so if they are struck down

One of them specifically

10

then it would strike down fusion for Statewide elections

11

and you - -

12

QUESTION:

And then there would be a problem

13

with determining the amount of votes garnered for each

14

party, or a potential problem.

15

MR. SLOWES:

The State would have to retune its

16

system, figure out how it is going to deal with the issue

17

of how you count the votes for a major party, along with

18

the issues such as are we going to have an aggregated or a

disaggregated ballot.

23

QUESTION:

That is, does the candidate get a

But why are these such difficult

issues for the State to deal with?
Why, for example, can't the State simply decide

24

that in the case in which there is a question of party

25

qualification based on the vote, that one -- that the

1

major party will be deemed to have preeminence, and the

2

vote will count for that purpose, that a minor party will

3

not be allowed in an ambiguous case to count the vote.

4

Why can't the State come up with some kind of a

5

tie-breaker rule which would be easier or less restrictive

6

on voter choice than the antifusion rule?

7

MR. SLOWES:

Your Honor, I'm not suggesting that

8

the State's ability or inability to figure out how it

9

wants to count these votes toward major party status is

10

the preeminent interest that justifies the fusion ban, but

11

I think it illustrates a slightly different point, and

12

that is, what goes into creating a fair and orderly and

13

efficient electoral process involves a lot of judgments,

14

essentially a lot of political engineering about how the

15

pieces of the system will work together.

16
17
18

This is just one of those pieces, and what we
are suggesting is that where the States -QUESTION:

If that's not the preeminent

19

20

confusion isn't your justification, what are your stronger

21

justifications?

22

MR. SLOWES:

If voter

The justifications -- I think voter

23

confusion is an interest, Your Honor, and that's a side

24

point of it.

1

confusion if that is not offset by voter information?

2

That is, it's one thing to have a candidate only on the

3

line of major party.

4

that same candidate on the line of minor party that has

5

certain goals and objectives.

It's quite another thing to have

6

So when the public sees someone not only in the

7

line of major party but also of minor party, whether it's

8

to the left or right of the political spectrum, that is

9

telling the voters more about that candidate, so isn't --

10

is that irrelevant, that informing function of being, say,

11

on the liberal party line or on the conservative party

12

line in the State of New York, to take that as an example?

13

MR. SLOWES:

Justice Ginsburg, our position is

14

not that it's irrelevant.

of communicative use of the ballot is not constitutionally

16

Our position is that that kind

by Justice Scalia that it might be important for the State

2

to determine which party garners the most votes, and then

3

you were asked a question, well, couldn't we presume that

the preemininent party gets the votes.

that minor parties would agree with such a presumption.

an advantage, or perhaps taking it even a step further --

May I put another question to you

that - - what concerns me in the background?

14

I remember when General Eisenhower ran for

15

President there was a real possibility both major parties

16

might have nominated him, and it would seem to me that

17

each of those parties would have had a strong

18

associational interest in picking the nominee of its

19

choice.

20

Now, why is it that they shouldn't be allowed to

21

both nominate General Eisenhower if they wanted to?

22

is the powerful interest that would prevent each party

23

from picking its own nominee?

If we were deciding this case, I guess without

They didn't want other parties, and is it unfair --do you

Justice Souter, there are a number

of responses to that question.

in United States v. O'Brien and other cases that a

MR. SLOWES:

Our position is that the

making would really take you into all of those areas,

4

because they suggest that if there is an aspect of the

they say fusion is more beneficial to minor parties.

him on the ballot even if he's already on the ballot, and

serve First Amendment values, and they say it wouldn't,

that the State does not have an interest that would

suffice to prevent that.

if one said that what this does is pose the problem that

Storer involved, that is, a problem in which a political

There are a lot of rules deliberately

Proportional representation in many parties

allows parties to grow more quickly and is a better

On the other hand, two parties, which is a much
worse representation, and interferes with people's ability

to choose what they want, has the advantage that we know

whom to hold responsible for good or bad government.

12

Now, you, like I, have read both those positions

argued at depth, so where the Constitution is at stake,

14

how can we say that a State doesn't have the right to

choose between those two different views of democratic

representation?

17

And I know it's a matter of degree, but what I

keep coming back to is thinking this was a fairly marginal

method of giving the Republicans, if you like, or

Republicans and Democrats, an advantage as to the swing

voters who were somewhat indifferent, who would go and

look at the columns on the ballot and they'd see DFL here,

You see, that would help that party, and it

kind of responsibility that the classic argument for a

two-party system democratically holds is important, so how

am I to judge that?

How can I say that the State has no right in

these kinds of things to decide either of those two models

that it believes is the more -- better democracy?

9

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think that I

10

would urge a distinction between the basic architecture of

11

the system, that is, the decision to have single member

12

rather than multimember districts, and having decided

13

that, therefore ruling out proportional representation

14

within the single member districts.

15

The decision of the basic design, when you said

16

that that was intended to have an effect on minor parties,

17

I think the evidence is that it was, as with most of these

18

things, multifarious in its intentions.

19

There are some people who think that the choice

20

of a single rather then multimember districts has a number

21

of positive effects on avoiding the submergence of certain

22

minority groups.

to be used as a way of getting on the ballot, deciding

2

where to draw district lines, at that point, as I think

3

Justice O'Connor said in Vandemer, it would be very hard

4

to have justiciable standards for assessing what the State

5

is doing.

6

Once the building has been designed, once the

7

basic architecture is set, once you have the time, place,

8

and manner regulations, the fundamental architecture,

9

then, if you take aim at the content of political

10

alliances, when you tell two parties within this system

11

you can get together about other things, you can have a

12

mutual nonaggression pact, neither of you will run against

13

the other, you could pool your resources -- in 1944 --

14

QUESTION:

Why does that make any difference?

15

It's sort of like saying you can paint the whole building

16

green but you can't paint the window frets green.

17

It's okay in the most fundamental design of the

18

system, in those aspects that have the most impact, to act

out of two-party system motivation, but it's -- in the

So that there is a specific rule that says even

though we've designed our ballot in such a way that you

13

can indicate who you want even if that person hasn't been

14

nominated, you can't indicate who you want if it happens

15

to be the nominee of another party.

16

It is a targeted way, not of saying the purpose

17

of our ballots is not to serve as billboards.

It's to

18

exercise power.

19

It's a way of saying, we are designing the system, we're

20

engineering it in such a way as to preclude agreement

21

among people of a certain kind expressed not through some

22

use of the ballot that the State hasn't already

23

legitimated, but through the standard use of the ballot,

24

so that it in effect is a targeted way of shaping the

25

kinds of consensual alliances people can have.

That the Court said in Burdick is fine.

I think that after

MR. TRIBE:

Well, most people actually suggest

In other words, if you have to allow people to

MR. TRIBE:

Well, in California, Justice

Kennedy, they disallow fusion and they still have these

terribly long ballots.

confusion would be enhanced by fusion.

I don't know that there's any

And in particular, when Justice Souter asked

10

about the history, I think that should tell us a good bit.

11

Not just why were these things enacted, but where is the

evidence that in all the years prior to about 1905, that

13

hundreds of fusion candidacies existed, and the evidence

in New York up to the present that either the stability of

QUESTION:

Is it done -- with respect to judges,

uncommon to have the same good judge the choice of two,

With non -- in the election for

parties nominate or endorse, but it's often, and typically

17

the case with judges, that no party label is attached to

18

the judge's name in those States, and that is a possible

19

solution.
That is, if one agreed with the position that I

20

21

think Justice Scalia was in part suggesting, that the

point of the ballot isn't necessarily to get information

about which party, then there is a solution that's

In Tashjian, both the majority and the dissent

assumed that that was a paradigmatic exercise of First

Amendment rights.

6

Here, we move from endorsement to nomination,

does put the party name on the ballot counts for a great
