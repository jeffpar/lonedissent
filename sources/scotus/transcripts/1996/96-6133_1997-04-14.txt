ORAL ARGUMENT OF GILBERT H. LEVY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEVY:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In support of our discovery request in the

11
12

district court, we presented evidence that former Judge

13

Thomas Maloney systematically disregarded his oath of

14

office in favor of his self-interest.

15

to fix murder cases.

16

ascended to the bench as an attorney who fixed cases, and

17

who had ties to organized crime.
QUESTION:

18

He accepted bribes

He had a prior history before he

Well, would your case be any weaker

19

if he had never accepted -- never given bribes when he was

20

an attorney and simply had accepted them when he was a

21

judge?

22
23

It would not be any weaker, Mr. Chief

QUESTION:

Then why do you mention the attorney

1

MR. LEVY:

It seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice,

2

that it's relative to the character of the person who is

3

assumed to regard his oath and office and be fair in my

4

client's case, a factor, I think, that the district court

5

would want to take into consideration in determining

6

whether or not there was a due process violation.

7

QUESTION:

Well --

8

QUESTION:

What standard are you arguing for

9

here as a matter of constitutional law?

Do you think it's

10

necessary to show that the -- Judge Maloney made some

11

request, either by inference or expressly, in this case,

12

or do you think it's only necessary to show that he made

13

it in other cases?

14

MR. LEVY:

I think the standard, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, as this Court indicated in Murchison, is

16

probability of unfairness in this case.

17

the presentation that we made to the district court was

18

sufficient to demonstrate that, but if this Court decides

19

that that's not sufficient, or a district -- or a court

20

decides that's not sufficient, we're certainly in a

21

position to go forward and demonstrate more.

22

QUESTION:

We believe that

Well, when you say probability of

23

unfairness, you're saying that if you can show in some

24

other cases that he asked for a bribe, or that perhaps he

25

suggested if you didn't give him a bribe he would be very

tough on you, that would be enough, without showing

2

anything in this particular case?

3

or no, I think.

4

You can answer that yes

MR. LEVY:

No, Your Honor, if I may explain,

6

QUESTION:

Yes, certainly.

7

MR. LEVY:

I think all of this Court's analysis

5

please.

8

of this issue has always looked to the biasing influence

9

itself, and whether it was sufficiently strong.

10

If the biasing influence, which in this case was

11

corruption, has been deemed to be sufficiently severe,

12

this Court has always presumed prejudice and has not

13

looked to the question of whether or not the judge in a

14

particular case was actually biased towards the particular

15

defendant.

16

However, if actual bias were the standard, which

17

we maintain it isn't, we believe that we may be able to

18

show that if we're given access to the evidence.

19

QUESTION:

You -- I suppose you would show that

20

by something said to one of your client's lawyers by the

21

judge during his trial.

22

get that now.

23

MR. LEVY:

I would think you'd be able to

We may -- we think that we could show

24

that for what -- for example as to what Judge Maloney may

25

have said to the accomplices, who were Government

witnesses, at the time, who were involved in the bribe­

2

taking process at the same time that my client's case was

3

tried.

4

We may be able to explore the possibility that

5

there was a corrupt relationship between Judge Maloney and

6

the person that he appointed to be my client's attorney.

7

We believe that we may be able to show examples of

8

instances where Judge Maloney was corrupt in other cases

9

in which he didn't receive bribes.

10

We believe that, as the Government sensing

11

memorandum in the Maloney case indicated, we believe that

12

we may be able to show a lot of corruption going on right

13

at the same time as Mr. Bracy's trial, so that Judge

14

Maloney would have had to have leaned in favor of the

15

State just to be generally impartial.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, I'm not sure what the scope

17

of your concession was.

18

Justice, acknowledge that before you can proceed with

19

further discovery you must establish a probability of

20

unfairness?

21

MR. LEVY:

Did you, in response to the Chief

No, I don't -- I'm sorry, I misspoke,

22

Justice Scalia.

Thank you.

I think that we -- before I

23

can proceed with discovery we have to show something more

24

than bare allegations, as I understand this Court's

25

interpretation of Habeas Rule 6(e).

Certainly in this

case I maintain that we did show something more than bare

2

allegations.

3

was sufficient to allow us to proceed forward.

4

We showed quite a bit.

We think the showing

The judicial corruption, at least in my

5

estimation, is worse than the type of situations that this

6

Court has previously held to be a sufficient biasing

7

influence.

8

It's worse than a judge who may be the subject of personal

9

insults.

It's worse than direct pecuniary interest.

It's worse than a judge who's somehow receiving

10

income from the process, or is part of the process which

11

is benefiting from a conviction.
QUESTION:

At least in those --

Well, Mr. Levy, I think we need to

focus on two things here.

You have to deal with both those things

I'm just hearing a lot of generalizations about

MR. LEVY:

21

One, what is the substantive

Thank you, Justice O'Connor.

The

22

substantive standard is well-established in the Murchison

23

case.

It's probability of unfairness.

The good cause --

24

QUESTION:

Substantive standard for what?

25

MR. LEVY:

For judicial bias.

QUESTION:

For ultimate relief.

2

MR. LEVY:

Ultimate relief.

3

QUESTION:

Ultimate relief.

4

MR. LEVY:

The standard under 6(a)

is,

if -- may

5

be -- it demonstrated sufficient facts to indicate that

6

the petitioner may be entitled to relief under the

7

substantive standard, we maintain that we've already got

8

enough to satisfy the substantive standard, but certainly

9

at least we've shown good cause that we may be able --

10

entitled to relief.

11

There's no exact formulation, Justice O'Connor,

12

but presumably it -- we have -- in order to get discovery

13

we would have to show something less than what we would be

14

required to show in order to be able to obtain ultimate

15

relief .

16

QUESTION:

Well,

in assessing the probability of

17

bias,

18

it's likely that a judge who has committed himself to a

19

course of bribery is -- in a case where no bribe has been

20

offered or requested,

21

supposed to assume that that is a likelihood, based on

22

human nature or something?

23

determination of probability of bias?

am I supposed to make some judgment as to whether

24
25

MR. LEVY:
decisions,

is going to be pro-Government?

Am I

How might I make this

There -- based upon this Court's past

those types of assumptions have been made.

(800) FOR DEPO

For

1

example, in the contempt cases, where the defendant or a

2

party is insulting the judge, this Court in the past has

3

made an assumption that that type of direct personal on

4

attack -- personal attack on the judge will be so

5

disquieting to the judicial person that he or she will be

6

unfair, so I think at a certain threshold that type of

7

assumption is drawn.
QUESTION:

8

9

However, I don't -I think can -- we have some

experience with that that justifies that conclusion, but

10

in this case you're saying once on the take the judge can

11

never be trusted to be unbiased.
MR. LEVY:

12

It certainly would seem that somebody

3

has so little concern for the oath that he's going to take

4

bribes to fix murder cases is probably less of a reliable

5

person to be deemed to be a good judge than somebody

6

who' s

7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, not a good judge.

He's a

biased judge.
MR. LEVY:

Or a fair judge.

Somebody who's got

20

a past track record of unfairness, I think it's fair to

21

make an assumption that that person isn't going to be

22

fair, and that seems to me to be a much more compelling

23

assumption than somebody who may simply have had his or

24

her feelings hurt by a party.

25

QUESTION:

Well, then your position is that

1

you've got enough evidence really right now, I suppose.

2

The man did take bribes, and -- in other cases, and

3

therefore you say the permissible inference is that he's

4

unfair in all cases.

5
6

It doesn't -- that doesn't seem logical to me,
but it seems to me that's your position.

7

MR. LEVY:

My position, Mr. Chief Justice, is

8

that we do have enough evidence right now, but if the

9

Court decides that we need to show more, I think there's a

10

whole wealth of information out there, and we can show

11

more.

bribe, all his decisions have to be set aside?
MR. LEVY:

That is the inference.

It seems to

me this is the type of -- certainly the magnitude of

bribery that's involved with Judge Maloney is pretty much,

23

in my estimation at least, analogous to a rudderless ship.

egregious and so aggravated, there was a whole lot -QUESTION:

2

Mr. Levy, could you clarify for us,

3

of the 6,000 figure, does that include all guilty pleas,

4

for example, the 6,000 cases?

5

MR. LEVY:

Do you know?

I'm sure that some of them involved

6

guilty pleas.

7

in numerous instances there's nothing pending -QUESTION:

8

9

Some of them were minor matters.

Well, would your position require

that the guilty plea convictions be set aside?
MR. LEVY:

10

Any situation -- no, not the guilty

11

plea.

12

in any situation where a court --

13

I think

That's non -- predominantly nondiscretionary, but

QUESTION:

So maybe in most of the jurisdictions

14

the guilty pleas represent 90 or 95 percent of the

15

convictions, so maybe a lot of these were not trial.

16

MR. LEVY:

That's correct.

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

Well, are there other -- I mean,

19

obviously what was concerning the lower court is that

20

there are quite a few judges in Greylord who were

21

dishonest, and there are tens of thousands, perhaps, of

22

cases of criminals who are convicted, and they're worried

23

about releasing them and saying they're all going to have

24

new trials, since the evidence will have disappeared, and

25

so suddenly they will go free.

All right, that's what was

concerning the lower court.
Now, what we're looking for to consider is, are there

3

lines short of releasing all those people that make some

4

sense in terms of the fairness of the situation?

5

case by case, but what are we looking for case by case?

6

Are there characteristics?

pleaded guilty or not.
MR. LEVY:

8

9

You say

One might be whether they

Are there others?

This Court's cases on judicial bias

have never discussed a per se rule.

What they've talked

10

about is degrees of bias and whether or not the biasing

11

influence is sufficient so that the appellate court can

12

say - QUESTION:

13

I'm not thinking of what the cases

14

have held.

15

would make sense as a line.

16

releasing, let's say, all those who didn't plead guilty,

17

or are there other considerations that would segregate

18

those which are the most likely to be unfair from every

19

criminal case, at least every one without a guilty plea?

20

I'm thinking of what, in your experience,

MR. LEVY:

Is there anything short of

Well, certainly one consideration

21

would be the imposition of the death penalty.

22

consideration would be the extent to which the judicial

23

officer made discretionary rulings which potentially

24

affected the outcome of the case.

25

Another

Another consideration would simply be the nature

of the biasing influence, a fact-specific determination of

2

whether or not in a particular case the biasing influence

3

was so severe that the appellate court can say with

4

some -- or the reviewing court can say with some

5

confidence that there was a probability of unfairness.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, you're --

7

QUESTION:

You know, I can imagine -- I can

8

imagine cases where it -- the case has gone to a jury

9

trial, and there's no provable fault in the instructions

10

given to the jury, and there was no single evidentiary

11

ruling that could be said to be improper in any way, and

12

why should that case be upset, even though the judge turns

13

out to have been a very bad actor?

14

MR. LEVY:

With all due respect, Justice

15

O'Connor, it seems difficult to me to imagine a situation

16

in a serious criminal matter where the judge is not making

17

discretionary rulings all along the way which might in

18

some fashion have an impact on the outcome of the case, or

19

even if there's --

20

QUESTION:

But suppose we assume that those were

21

correct, and that they were within the discretion of an

22

honest judge of absolute probity.

23

MR. LEVY:

Even if we assume that they're

24

correct, Justice Kennedy, we cannot assume, particularly

25

under these circumstances, that the judge did not take his

1

or her self-interest into consideration in deciding how

2

she -- how he or she might make these discretionary

3

rulings, and that's really the problem.

4

If you simply look at the correctness of the

5

rulings that the judge made, then you insulate a whole

6

category of judicial bias from appellate court scrutiny,

7

because surely judges can influence or impact the outcome

8

of cases without appearing to abuse their discretion.

QUESTION:

Mr. -- I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to

cut off your sentence.

MR. LEVY:

That's fine, Justice Souter.

QUESTION:

There's one answer that you are not

giving to Justice Breyer's questions that I thought you

were going to give, and I had intended, actually, to raise

5

this with opposing counsel, but let me raise it with you.

6

MR. LEVY:

Okay.

7

QUESTION:

I would have thought that you would

8

have argued that one way to narrow the category down was

9

to look for evidence that raised a particular inference of

20

bias at the time of the trial in question, at the time

21

of -- your client was tried, as opposed simply to a

22

general shotgun corruption approach pervasive throughout

23

the judge's entire tenure.

24
25

And I thought that you had such an argument
here, because I -- and this is where I want you to correct

1

me if I'm wrong.
I thought the record indicated that in a case

2

3

that was tried after yours a bribe had been solicited

4

and -- or agreed upon prior to the trial of your case, so

5

that it would be a very good reason for supposing that the

6

judge would say, I'm going to dump the case that follows

7

this one, and therefore it's important to me, if I'm not

8

getting a bribe here, to come down hard on the State's

9

side so that I will look good here and hence not appear

10

too peculiar there.
Do you -- is -- are the facts such that you

11
12

could make that argument?
MR. LEVY:

3

Justice Souter, I think that the

4

facts are even more compelling.

5

would show that the bribe negotiations for the Lenny Chow

6

case, which was a $ 00,000 fix to acquit three murder

7

defendants, was going on at the same time as my client's

8

trial.
QUESTION:

9

I think the evidence

But you don't need any discovery to

20

find that out, and that's -- I'm very confused by your

21

presentation, because you seem to be dealing with an

22

absolute here, and yet the only question presented is

23

whether you've shown enough to be entitled to discovery,

24

so what would you discover that isn't on the public

25

record?

MR. LEVY:

It appears, Justice Ginsburg, in this

case -- and I'm not saying that the record shows it now,

7

but I think there's at least some suggestion of this in

the record, that Judge Maloney appointed an attorney who

was a former associate of his with the understanding that

this attorney would not object to the timing of the Bracy

to go to trial in a month on a triple homicide case,

would take the deposition of the gentleman who assisted

Judge Maloney with the bribe, the persons who were

MR. LEVY:

Justice Scalia --

QUESTION:

In fact, I -- you know, it seems to

me just the opposite, that a judge who is on the take in

some cases would look worse and would perhaps seem to be

taking bribes if he were, you know, a hanging judge in

most cases but in some cases all of a sudden comes out

with, you know, real bleeding heart rulings.

behavior than the one you want us to believe.

the fact that he is dishonest when he's given money does

QUESTION:

Mr. Levy, isn't your -- a point

you're overlooking is, he has to get himself reelected,

That which we could have brought to

thing as what we're asking for.

7

What we're asking for this Court to do is

precisely what we asked Judge Hart to do and he said he

wouldn't, which was an opportunity to depose these people

10

to ask them the precise questions that Justice Breyer

posed and Justice Scalia posed, which is, how did Judge

Maloney feel about the cases where he wasn't bribed, and

was there a relationship in terms of Judge Maloney's

Well, it's not speculation.

I mean,

it seems to me that it's a statement of one reasonable

possibility.

that Justice Scalia referred to, and that is, this fellow

wouldn't want to call attention to the oddity of his

That would be a reasonable basis, too.

Another reasonable possibility is the one

He would want to look a little soft if he could.

But you start discovery not by deciding between

10

one or the other of those theories.

11

by determining whether there is a reasonable basis for

12

saying that discovery may lead to evidence that would tend

13

to prove the probability that this particular petitioner

14

would have to prove.

the kind of argument that I've made?

You start discovery

Why hasn't he made that showing on

MS. PREINER:

Because I believe that what we

17

have here then is just a range of speculation.

18

speculate that the judge was more harsh in these cases.

19

You can speculate that he was more lenient in these cases.

20

You could speculate that if he was being unfair in one

21

case, he balances that off by being extremely fair in

another case.

MS. PREINER:

I believe they're all reasonable.

They're all reasonable speculation.

Is that your position?

QUESTION:

Well, if they're reasonable, then

we're beyond the point of mere speculation.

QUESTION:

Yes.

You can't define speculation as

being a choice between one of two probabilities.

MS. PREINER:

I suppose speculation would be

among a range of probabilities.

Of course, this isn't like a lot of

start with established facts that this judge took bribes

in a significant number of cases at roughly the same time

factual basis for saying we ought to take a little harder

QUESTION:

If this case,

would that automatically show bias that would entitle the

I don't believe that that would be

sufficient to show that there was bias in this case.

You do believe that it would?

MS. PREINER:

QUESTION:

I do not.

If you were to go as far as -- your

11

opposing counsel says that an attorney was appointed for

this person who would agree to a triple capital trial

3

within a month, when in fact he should have wanted a much

4

longer time to prepare.

I would like to emphasize again that the

evidence in this case was extremely strong against this

No.

QUESTION:

And no matter how strong the evidence

4

of guilt may have been, didn't this jury also make the

death determination?

6

MS. PREINER:

They did.

7

Under the circumstances of this case and the

8

competing interest in balancing the finality of the

judgment and the defendant or the petitioner's interest in

not being improperly confined, we submit that he had to

show good cause why he should be allowed to explore all of

in this case?
MS. PREINER:

2

I sympathize, and certainly the

3

Attorney General sympathizes also with those lawyers and

4

their perception that there is a taint on the judicial

5

system in Illinois because of the scandal, of the Greylord

scandal.

defendant who was clearly guilty -QUESTION:

10

No, but just to bring back the point

11

Justice O'Connor raised, we're really not -- we don't

really have to decide that.

13

We just have to decide whether the situation is

14

sufficiently serious that it demands the fullest possible

15

investigation before we decide what kind of rule should be

adopted in a case like this, because there -- it's

perfectly obvious that something might be learned by
