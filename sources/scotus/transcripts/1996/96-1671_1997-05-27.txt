CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Byrd, and counsel have been advised, I believe, that you

are to have 35 minutes each on a side.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER DELLINGER, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
GENERAL DELLINGER:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The single most important point I want to make

12

13

this morning is a point that goes both to standing and the

14

merits, and it is this:

15

Act does not alter the authority or the ability of

16

Congress to require the executive branch to spend

17

appropriated funds.

18

legislative option about whether an appropriation should

19

be mandatory or discretionary remains fully available to a

20

simple majority of Congress.

the passage of the Line Item Veto

After the act, as before, every

When the time comes to vote on an appropriations

21

22

bill, the legal effect of each option, mandatory,

23

discretionary, linked or unlinked, will be perfectly

24

clear.

25

simple majority of Congress retains full authority to

Every Member's vote will be fully counted.

3

appellee's claim of standing.

4

This point goes to the heart of the

Consider their best shot, I believe is the

5

example with which they - - they feature in the opening of

6

their reply brief, an example where a Member votes for an

7

ABC bill which might lead, they say, to the post hoc

8

creation of an ABC law or an AC law.
Suppose, they say, the items A, B, and C are aid

9
10

to Egypt, to Jordan, and to Israel.

A Member of Congress

11

might well wish to vote for the delicate balance embodied

12

in the entire package, but have objections to keeping any

13

of the items if the others were to be stricken.

14

converts a vote, they say, for ABC in toto into a vote for

15

a three-item menu from which the President may select any

16

combination that he alone prefers, and the Member is

17

injured at the moment he must cast his vote.

18

simply a profound misunderstanding of the nature of the

19

situation.

The act

This is

20

When the time comes for Congress to vote on the

21

omnibus foreign aid bill it can, by simple majority, make

22

any choice it wants about mandating or linking those

23

funds.

25

be expended for payments to country A unless funds are

provided concurrently to the other two countries, or

2

Congress can vote to mandate all three, using the language

3

it actually sets out in the bill for limited tax benefits

4

by saying something like, section 1021(a) of the

5

Empowerment Control Act shall not apply to provisions I,

6

J, and E of this appropriations act.

7

QUESTION:- Well, it could do that all across the

8

board, I suppose, General Dellinger, simply perhaps render

9

the thing kind of a nullity if it incorporated that sort

10

of a provision in every appropriations item.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

11

It could, of course, though

12

we doubt that it would.

13

important functions as a background default mode but it

14

is -- would not be at all surprising if particular

15

projects were put forth at an appropriation and also with

16

the notion that section 1021(a) should not apply.
QUESTION:

17

We think that the act has

Well, of course, the President then

18

could veto such subsequent bill and that would then

19

require a larger vote of Congress to override the veto.

20

mean, it does put them in a different position to that

21

extent, perhaps.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

22

No, I'm not sure that I

23

agree, if I understand your question, Justice O'Connor.

on that maybe some type of appropriations shouldn't be

subject to this line item veto, so they include passage in

3

a subsequent bill saying that the Line Item Veto Act won't

apply to a certain type of appropriation.

5

course, has to go to the President for signature, and he

6

then can veto that and that then would require enough

7

votes to override that veto.

8

GENERAL DELLINGER:

9

QUESTION:

10

11

That, of

Yes, that --

And to that extent it kind of changes

the equation.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

But in your example Congress

12

passes the requirement that the provision be exempt from

13

this provision only after it has first passed an omnibus

14

appropriations act, but Congress is more likely to choose

15

to do that with an appropriation it cares about in the

16

process of passing the omnibus appropriations act, and

17

that's not, you know, unfamiliar.

18

Congress in the very act that they use as an

19

example provided that the assistance for Israel and Egypt

20

shall be provided with the President's assurance that the

21

level does not cause an adverse impact on the total level

22

of military support, that the sum of $815 million

23

available only for Egypt with the understanding that Egypt

24

will undertake significant economic reforms, et cetera.

25

That is to say, Congress is quite familiar with

1

that process, so that I think if you looked at this in the

2

context of a real case or controversy after the fact, you

3

might well have seen that Senator Byrd or Senator Moynihan

4

had moved to link the aid to Egypt, Israel, and Jordan,

5

and had that rejected, 53-47, and then moved to make --

6

QUESTION:

Well, but in all events, Mr.

7

Dellinger, you are defending the line item veto as it was

8

enacted and as it was intended to work, are you not?

9
10

GENERAL DELLINGER:
QUESTION:

That is correct.

And it does seem to me that there is

11

some point to the argument that this changes the

12

legislative dynamic.

13

sufficient to create a cause of action or standing is what

14

we're here to decide.

15

Now, whether or not that is

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Yes.

It was intended to and

16

it does change the legislative dynamic, but not in a way

17

that creates a legal injury.

18

QUESTION:

Senator --

Mr. Solicitor General, your example

19

of the ABC and a small number certainly is easy to

20

understand.

21

the -- it is anticipated that the budget bill will include

22

maybe hundreds of items, or a very large number, and it's

23

unlikely that you could work out all combinations in

24

advance, so that for example if a Congressman was

25

interested in the Navy Yard in San Diego or something he

They can do that.

But isn't it true that it

2

wouldn't know whether that would survive.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

No, he wouldn't, but that's

3

only because he will have been unable to convince a

4

majority of his colleagues to make that mandatory.

5

I mean, the critical aspect --

6

QUESTION:

Yes, but isn't it true -- isn't it

7

true that the typical bill is anticipated to have a large

8

number of items and that the ABC example is really not

9

very realistic.

10

GENERAL DELLINGER:

That is correct.

That is

11

their example, and I do understand that the bill has a

12

large number of items, but a Member who has a very

13

particular interest in preserving the San Diego Shipyard

14

has it within his power to convince a majority of his

15

colleagues by simply adding the phrase that to this item

16

section 1021(a) shall not apply.

17
18

QUESTION:

Yes, but then you might have 300

different Congressmen wanting to put that rider on - -

19

GENERAL DELLINGER:

20

QUESTION:

21

GENERAL DELLINGER:

That is correct.

-- that particular item.
And what it would take is

22

the political will on the part of Congress to maintain the

23

commitment that the Line Item Veto Act represents the

24

deficit reduction, but the --

1

from what you've said so far that no one would have

2

standing because no one would be injured, because all

3

choices are always open to Congress.

4

In your brief, you took the position that this

5

is not a whether question but a who and a when question,

6

but now you seem to say, well, there's nothing really

7

that's changed.

Congress retains the power to do anything

Justice O'Connor, it is a

May I apologize

Justice Ginsburg, it's a

particularly good question, too, so I'm -- the -- I hate
to attribute it elsewhere.
That is not what I am suggesting, because of

22

course there will be standing at the appropriate time by

23

someone who is injured.

24

Senators and Members do not have standing now and never

25

will have standing.

I'm suggesting that these

And isn't his argument that there is

a lack of legislative regularity that violates the

14

Constitution?

GENERAL DELLINGER:

15
16
17

Isn't that what his argument is?
I suppose that is his

argument.
QUESTION:

Just as in the Chadha case there was

18

a violation of the Constitution in the way the bill was

19

enacted as to Chadha.

20

Now, if that's so, if there's a violation of the

21

constitutional regularity that is mandated on the

22

Congress, why isn't there an injury now?

GENERAL DELLINGER:

There's not an injury now

because these Members of Congress at this point can vote

others allege that they are presently uncertain about what

the outset they have in the hands of the majority of their

colleagues the key to their own uncertainty by - -

8

QUESTION:
about injury in fact?

They don't.

How -- are we talking

I mean, injury in fact?

A Senator

or Congressman is sitting there with a bill that's about
10

this high and says, I don't even -- I've never read this

11

entire thing, frankly, with the budget.

12

other people to tell me everything in it, and I can't

13

figure out every permutation and combination, and if

14

you're telling me I'm supposed to go start having special

15

laws passed as a factual matter I can't do it, and so I'm

16

injured in fact.

I'm relying on

17

Now, why isn't that an injury in fact?

18

there are prudential reasons why in certain circumstances

1

a Congressman or Senator should not be allowed to make

20

such a claim to have standing, but why isn't it an injury

21

in fact?

22

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Maybe

It is not an injury

23

sufficient for Article III purposes.

I know that he may

24

be harmed at present, because that uncertainty he shares

25

in common with any Member of Congress who does not know

1

how certain the future is.

2

If you're voting on the Omnibus Crime Control

3

Act, it may be that the death penalty provision or the gun

4

control provision is the sole reason you would vote for

5

such a bill, and yet you do not know at the point you have

6

to vote whether this Court would sustain such a provision.

7

You in that sense have,

8

factual injury which may lead you to seek an advisory

9

opinion.

10

QUESTION:

if you want to call it that, a

Fine,

so why aren't all those things,

11

which are excellent points, excellent reasons as to why

12

prudential rules of standing make it virtually impossible

13

for such a legislator ever to bring such a case, but not

14

constitutional reasons, because there might be, and is in

15

this instance,

16

say the other side, an injury in fact.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

We believe it is -- we

17

concede and concur that the prudential standing of

18

objections have been set to one side by the act of

19

Congress setting aside Members, but we believe that there

20

is an absence here of an Article III injury because it is

21

fundamentally inconsistent with our separation of powers

22

to assume that a Member of the legislature has an interest

23

in the legislation for which he voted after it is enacted

24

and when it is being implemented.

25

QUESTION:

What do you do with Coleman?

GENERAL DELLINGER:

2

dubious, at best, and distinguishable.

3

the conferral of standing upon the legislative Members of

4

the Kansas Senate was on the basis of an allegation that

5

their actual vote was not properly counted in the

6

legislative process itself.

7

to compel a proper record of legislative action.

8

I think Coleman is both
That is to say,

They were seeking a mandate

Here, they're -- everything that needs to be

9

known they can find out before they vote, and they're

10

really complaining about the President's hypothetical

11

implementation of an act in the future.

12

QUESTION:

I guess I'm not sure why the

13

distinction between the two cases isn't simply one of

14

characterization.

15

legislators subjected, in effect, to the same portent that

16

the Members of Congress is subjected to, however you may

17

want to describe them?

18

Wasn't the -- weren't the Kansas

GENERAL DELLINGER:

A majority of the Kansas

19

legislature, which is already a difference, 21 of the 40

20

Members, brought that action complaining that 20 of them

21

had voted no, and that their vote had been erroneously

22

recorded as approving the child labor amendment when they

23

had in fact rejected it.

24

Now, there may be other prudential reasons for a

25

court not to get involved in intralegislative battles, but

1

as the executive branch we would not have a concern there,

2

and would recognize that that may be an injury within the

3

executive branch.

4

I do think that the fact that the case was

5

brought in State court, when no one objected to Justice

6

Frankfurter's assertion for four justices in dissent that

7

no one would dispute you could not have brought this in

8

Federal court at that time.
QUESTION:

No, but even apart from that,

I mean,

10

the fact is that on appeal the standing requirement is

11

exactly the same, so the fact that it began in a State

12

court and the fact that no one objected up to a certain

13

point still leaves the jurisdictional necessity to deal

14

with.

15
16

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Again,

I think that Coleman

is dubious and shows - -

17

QUESTION:

But not for that reason.

18

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Not for that -- I think it

is dubious to consider that this is a justiciable

controversy.

was sort of a missing judge on one of the issues, a nine-

2

justice court.

3

one of the issues, but four justices, including Justice

4

Black, Justice Douglas and Justice Frankfurter, joined a

5

very strong opinion by Justice Frankfurter that made the

basic point that it is not for this Court to issue

opinions.

You know, the -QUESTION:

And it was on the way to throwing the

case out for want of a - - because it was a political
question.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

That's right, but the Court

12

did resolve important constitutional questions in Coleman

13

v. Miller, in a case that still isn't ripe to this day,

14

which shows the benefits of adhering to Article III.

15

There still haven't been a --

16

QUESTION:

But on the ripeness question the very

17

example that you gave, you said it's a ripeness question.

18

Somebody eventually can sue, but who could sue if the

19

President cancels the aid to, say, Jordan?

20

after the fact?

21

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Who could sue

Well, there well may not be

22

anyone who could sue but that -- on that particular cases.

23

There will certainly be people who can challenge the

24

validity of giving to the President, delegating to the

25

President the cancellation authority, because the

Yes, but I just wanted to make sure

that you were acknowledging - GENERAL DELLINGER:

That is correct.

There

could be some cancellations - QUESTION:

-- that there would be many cases

where no one -- no one would have standing.
GENERAL DELLINGER:

Yes.

Justice Ginsburg,

17

there should be some cancellations for which there would

18

be no one who had standing, but --

QUESTION:

Do you also agree that ripeness

really is not a concern for us at this point?

concern about ripeness?

GENERAL DELLINGER:

But in this sense.

I think

what the very able attorneys for the Members of Congress

6

flaws, lack of standing and lack of ripeness, and merged

illusion of a case or controversy.

I think if we had had an actual cancellation of

10

aid to hog farmers, clearly a hog farmer could sue, but we

11

would not at that point believe that a Member of Congress

12

could come into court and say, this is not, and the

13

President is not implementing this act in a way that I

14

thought so.

By moving --

to the Court after the fact.

You might well have a case come before you where

17

Senator Moynihan had voted to link all three provisions,

18

or where Senator Byrd had moved to make the Dellinger

19

Center a mandatory item exempted from 1021 on the floor.

20

You would have seen that he'd been able to make that

would have been his inability to persuade a majority of

QUESTION:

Mr.

-- General Dellinger, do you

3

think ripeness is a matter just, you know, prudential, or

does it have some sort of Article III component?

5

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

I believe

6

it does have an Article III component when there is not

7

yet an actual case or controversy.

8
9

That is to say, even if a Member was going to
have standing after the President cancelled his or her

10

favorite project, Article III standing and an injury -- my

11

project was cancelled -- which we would dispute, they

12

clearly would not have standing now to say that I'm

13

worried that the President may cancel my favorite project,

14

and I'm worried anticipatorily that I will not be able to

15

convince a majority of my colleagues to make an exemption,

16

and you're saying --

17

QUESTION:

But the basis for objecting to the

cancellation is that there is an irregularity, an

Members seeking exemptions for their own pet projects and

having the majority vote on it, if you have occasion, look

at page 55a of the appendix to the Jurisdictional

Statement.

5

It's the section of the bill, section 1027, it

6

happens to deal with the limited tax benefit, but they

7

actually set out in the bill the language to be used to

8

exempt targeted tax benefits from the provisions of the

9

act, and that language works perfectly well for any

10
11

provision.
QUESTION:

All right, but General, couldn't we

12

recharacterize the provision in this way, not merely in a

13

vague way that the dynamics have changed, which everybody

14

agrees that they have, but by saying that as a result of

15

this bill unless Congress in, let's say, a given

16

appropriations act agrees to exempt every single item in

17

that act from the effect of this statute, which is highly

18

unlikely, then when any given Member votes on a bill with

19

those provisions on it, he does not know in the sense that

20

he has traditionally known, what it is that he is voting

21

on that will, depending on the vote, either become law or

not become law.

GENERAL DELLINGER:

Justice Souter, he does

of provisions which his up or down determination will

either, in the old sense, require the President to act on

But if you take a bill like the very first defense

funds are authorized not to exceed X amount to defray the

6

can choose to build ships or not build ships.

7

In this case, it is true that the bill as it

8

finally passed made the President's decision to cancel

irrevocable, and the irony I think of this litigation is

10

that the very steps that Congress took to make sure that

11

the delegation was not excessive, that is to cabin the

12

President's discretion to deal with what Senator Byrd has

13

called the Sword of Damocles problem -- the President can

hold out over Members the possibility that he may cancel

their project, or that he may, having cancelled it,

uncancel it if a Member will be sufficiently favorable to

the respondents are correct that the exercise of the power

given to the President here, the cancellation, would be a

violation of the Constitution as constituting an unlawful

May I give an example, if I may?

One of the

13

features of this bill that makes it so significant to

change the dynamic is that the President's power of

cancellation extends not simply to items on the face of

16

the statute, but everything in the legislative history

MR. MORRISON:

And wouldn't that cause

Let me be very clear about the

7

concept of separate enrollment, because I do not believe

8

the Solicitor General's brief is as clear as it might be

on this.

There are two concepts of separate enrollment.

10

One item, one bill passed through both houses of Congress

11

as separate items, and then signed by the President.

concept would be perfectly constitutional.

That

The concept of separate enrollment as it passed

And the President could

In our view, that is just as an unconstitutional

as this bill.

And, indeed, Mr. Dellinger testified before

8

the Senate he believed that that was unconstitutional as

well.

Because the bill that has passed the Congress is

not what is being presented to the President.

11

violation of the Presentment Clause.

12

It is a

So, if I may, to answer your question that way,

But -- and without having thought about it

Mr. Morrison, let's go back for a

injury here if in fact the -- that would really do away

with all of our declaratory judgment jurisprudence, would

it not, to accept that, if you -- you can't bring a

attacking is unconstitutional, they can't do anything to
