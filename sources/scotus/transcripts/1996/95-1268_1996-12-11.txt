ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. JOSEPH CURRAN, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
GENERAL CURRAN:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Nearly 20 years ago this Court held in the case

11

of Pennsylvania v. Mimms that it was reasonable under the

12

Fourth Amendment for a police officer in making a car stop

3

for a traffic violation to require the driver to exit the

4

car.

5

it was also permitted for the officer to request the

6

driver to get out without any suspicion that the driver

7

would pose a danger to the officer.

8
9

The risk to the officer is such in these stops that

The latest figures that we have available
demonstrate that the risks are real to police officers in

20

traffic stops.

The latest figures in

994 show that 5,762

21

police officers were assaulted in traffic stops.

22

since the decision in Mimms there have been over 200

23

police officers slain in traffic stops.

Indeed,

24

Because passengers, like drivers, have --

traffic stops does that include those who were assaulted

2

by people who got out of the car and physically assaulted

3

them?

GENERAL CURRAN:

QUESTION:

The -- yes.

Yes, Justice --

Well, that would cut the other way.

6

I mean, that --they'd be better off to leave them in the

7

car, if that --you know, if that's the assault you're

8

talking about.
GENERAL CURRAN:

9

Well, there were a total of

10

some 52,000 assaults during that given year,

11

5,700 were in traffic stops.
QUESTION:

12

'94, of which

What I'm suggesting is that the

13

relevant figure is how many of the assaults came while a

14

person was in the car, so that they might have been

15

prevented by making the person get out of the car.

16

of them may have occurred by taking the person out of the

17

car.

QUESTION:

Okay.

GENERAL CURRAN:

22

QUESTION:

-- Your Honor.

Isn't it true, General Curran --I

23

remember this from the Mimms case -- that there's a split

24

of professional opinion on whether it is safer for the

25

officer to order them out of the car or to tell them to

2

professional law enforcement opinion that says you're

3

safer if you don't ask them to get out of the car?

4

Is there still a respected body of

GENERAL CURRAN:

Well, Justice Stevens, the

5

typical practice, and I can refer to Maryland, of course,

6

but I believe the briefs will show the typical practice is

7

to control the risk.

8

control the risk, and typically they keep the driver and

9

the passenger in the car.

That's what the training is, to

However, having said that, as the New York v.

10
11

Class case indicated, there is this discretion the officer

12

can use, and what we're asking, of course, is the

3

automatic rule for that discretion to be utilized in the

4

Wilson case, as this Court granted in the Mimms case.

5

QUESTION:

General Curran, are you saying that

6

if the officer made the decision to keep the person

7

inside, it would be the officer's call, too?

8

passenger says, I want out.

9

go home -- take a cab and go home.
GENERAL CURRAN:

20

Suppose a

I'm going to take a car and

The answer is yes, Justice

21

Ginsburg.

We want the officer to be able to require the

22

passenger to get out or, where it's appropriate, to stay

23

in, and in order to control the stop the officer should be

24

able to control the location of the passenger, and the

25

location can be outside the car, or it could be, in an

QUESTION:

How far does the authority extend?

Would you say that the passenger would be free to leave if

GENERAL CURRAN:

12

The officer has to -- Mr. Chief

13

Justice, the officer has to be able to control the stop,

14

to complete safely the transaction, getting the

15

information from the driver, the registration, the

16

license, et cetera, and in order to do that safely, he

needs to be able to know where any potential danger to him

11

Well, Michigan and Summers,

Is that the closest case, do you

think?

12

GENERAL CURRAN:

13

QUESTION:

Sir?

Is that the closest case to support

14

the proposition that the officer does have this authority

15

to control the location?

16

GENERAL CURRAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

To control

17

the safe completion of, in that case the search of the

18

house, he had to have the ability to make certain that he
»

19

could safely and successfully complete the search, and the

20

same weight goes here.

QUESTION:

The --

Well, but there is a difference.

I

22

mean, the driver was stopped because there was reason to

23

believe he had violated a traffic law, or requirement,

24

that the driver was speeding while making an illegal turn,

25

or without a license on the car, or whatever.

But there is no such suspicion on the part of

2

the passenger, who was not driving the car, and I don't

3

think Pennsylvania v. Mimms, which says yes, you can

4

require the driver to step out and wait until the ticket

5

is issued or a resolution is made on that question, but

6

I'm just not sure what the authority is for detaining a

7

passenger who is required to step out.

not suspected of an illegal driving offense.

GENERAL CURRAN:

The passenger is

Justice O'Connor, we would

10

respectfully suggest that it's the Mimms decision that

11

required the driver to exit not because in this case he

12

was speeding, as was the probable cause, or not because

3

there was a faulty tag, but because the Court concluded

4

that there was potential danger, and so for the reason

5

that they wanted -- police safety was the reason Mimms got

6

out of the car, not because there was --

7

QUESTION:

Yes, but nevertheless they had a

8

right to stop the car because it was an alleged traffic

9

violation by the driver, isn't that so, otherwise they

20

couldn't have stopped the car at all, presumably.

21

GENERAL CURRAN:

22

QUESTION:

That is correct.

Okay, and that reason does not apply

23

to the passenger, so I'm trying to understand what is your

24

authority for claiming the right not only to require the

25

passenger to exit, but to detain the passenger.

GENERAL CURRAN:

1

If Your Honor please, when

2

there was a stop of the Mimms car or the Wilson car by

3

virtue of physics both are seized, or both are detained,

4

so there the driver and the passenger are identical.

5

They're both seized.
If,

6

They're both stopped.

in fact,

the rationale of Mimms is to be

7

conveyed to the passenger,

8

is equally apparent that the passenger would have had

9

much -- just as much access to the gun as Mr. Mimms would

10

the safety of the officer,

it

have had.
QUESTION:

11

But it's not just physics,

it's

12

privacy and dignity, and we all know that the police will

13

take our decisions as far as their language and logic

14

permit, and I'm just concerned that you're going to have

15

routine practices of whole families and four or five

16

occupants of the cars being required to stand outside

17

while the officer lectures the driver.

just going to happen,

I mean,

that's

isn't it?

GENERAL CURRAN:

Well, Justice Kennedy,

that

would happen now in Mimms, because without any discretion,

21

or any guidelines,

22

require someone to exit.

1

QUESTION:

And you're proposing a general

2

automatic rule that passengers can always be required to

3

exit at the demand of the officers.

4

GENERAL CURRAN:

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor, that's

5

the proposal that we have, and the rationale being that

6

the order out in Mimms was not because of the traffic

7

violation but because of the finding that there is --

8

there's a compelling reason for police safety to require

9

the officer to make that --

10

QUESTION:

But you have a lesser interest on the

11

part of the driver in privacy or not being free from

12

whatever you -- whether it's searching -- the driver --

13

there's probable cause to believe that the driver has

14

committed an offense, whereas there isn't any probable

15

cause to believe that the passenger has committed offense,

16

an offense, so the calculus, if it's a weighing process,

17

the interests of the passenger would seem stronger than

18

the interest of the driver.

19

GENERAL CURRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I would take

20

the position that the privacy interests of the driver and

21

the passenger are identical.

22

However, if the Court should so find that there

23

is a minor privacy interest difference, notwithstanding,

24

there still is -- as far as the passenger is concerned he

25

already has a diminished expectation of privacy, and with

1

that diminished expectation of privacy, we're talking

2

about a very diminished intrusion.
QUESTION:

3

Well, not necessarily.

Suppose it's

4

a driving snowstorm, or a blinding rainstorm, the

5

passenger is a mother with a very young baby, and the

6

officer automatically can order her out of the car, to put

7

the baby down outside where he can see the baby and raise

8

her hands up, and real damage can occur, and there is no

9

reason that the car was stopped because of what that

10

passenger was doing under the circumstances here.
Now, maybe an officer can see a passenger in the

11
12

car holding a gun.

13

isn't it.

14

thinks there is a real difference between the driver and

15

the passenger in that the driver can be stopped for what

16

the officer perceives is a traffic violation.

17

Well, that's a different situation,

But is there any -- and suppose the Court

GENERAL CURRAN:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I see

18

the point you're trying to raise, and obviously the

19

question of a baby and a young mother out in the rain is

20

obviously not --

QUESTION:

GENERAL CURRAN:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because bureaucracies being what they

3

are, in order to protect themselves from claims of

4

discrimination, making some people get out because of

5

their race or because of whatever else, to be sure that no

6

such claims will be available they will make everybody get

out.

That will be an invariable rule.

about it?

are required to parade the -- required to remain in public

any concerns about that?

that there might be a difference.

the risk of abuse.

in your position.

GENERAL CURRAN:

I'm not so sure that's the

case, Justice Souter, because as I say, the typical

training in our manual, which indicates -- and I believe

it's typical across the Nation -- is to require both the

GENERAL RENO:

Mr. Chief Justice,

Traffic stops present special dangers to police
officers.

They're faced with an unknown situation,

an

10

unknown area,

11

knowledge of the occupants of the car,

12

vulnerable to attack not just from the driver but from the

13

passenger.

14

they're faced with little knowledge,

In Mimms,

this Court found that these safety

15

concerns justify a per se rule that an officer in a valid

traffic stop can order the driver to exit the vehicle.

submit that Mimms should be applied to passengers for

18

three reasons on the issue of order to exit.

19

First,

the driver -- the officer has to focus on

20

the driver in implementing the traffic stop and in

securing the information with respect to a license or to

1

risk as an officer approaches a person seated in the car,

2

and the Court specifically said that the officer had no

3

reason in Mimms to believe that the officer was suspect as

4

to foul play, so it was the focus on a person seated in

5

the car that created the danger.
QUESTION:

6

General Reno, you want no

reasonableness limitation on this.

8

that a police officer could stop a bus and say, everybody

off the bus.

GENERAL RENO:

Yes, Your Honor.

That might be a

more difficult question for the Court, but -QUESTION:

Or -- you know, does vehicle size come into

it?

11
12

I suppose that means

Well, not for you.

You want no

reasonableness limitation.
GENERAL RENO:

15

Again, the bus situation can be

16

an unknown situation for that officer, and he needs the

17

opportunity, under our position, to be able to size up the

18

situation, to determine and observe the people involved,

19

and he may determine that he wishes them to stay in or to

exit.

22

and depending on the circumstances of the traffic stop.

We are submitting that under the -- this Court's

rule in Mimms, it is the persons seated in the vehicle

25

that create the danger and the approach to that danger,

full view of them when appropriate, get them out of the

QUESTION:

He should be

I

8

mean, your argument is that he ought to be able to size up

the situation.

10

Terry gives him a chance to size up the

situation.
GENERAL RENO:

Terry might not have given, if

12

the passenger had been in the same situation as Mimms with

13

a gun in his -- under his sports coat, he might not have

14

been able to see that seated in the car.

QUESTION:

Well, then I think what you're really

arguing, and I think this was what the Attorney General

is any reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is

2

armed, and then advance to Terry frisk if that is

3

appropriate, but that he should have the opportunity to

control the situation if he is the single officer on the

5

scene before the backup comes, to keep them in the car so

6

that he doesn't have a person moving here, here, and here,

7

or to get them out of the car if there are circumstances

8

that dictate that they should be out of the car.

9

QUESTION:

General Reno, you are arguing for a

10

bright line test, and I'm wondering how that squares with

11

the very recent decision of this Court in Robinette, which

12

said that reasonableness is always case-by-case totality

13

of the circumstances, and yet here you're saying that it's

14

reasonable in any and all circumstances for the police

15

officer to say, everybody out, or everybody in.

16

doesn't go case-by-case.

17

GENERAL RENO:

That

In Robinette, Your Honor, the

18

Court specifically cited it would favor the Mimms

19

decision, and concluded -- pointed out that Mimms,

20

considering all the totality of the circumstances, that it

21

was reasonable in light of the safety concern for the

22

officer that was more than balanced against the de minimis

23

intrusion into the passenger's personal security, that in

24

those totality of circumstances it was reasonable, under

25

Mimms, to justify it.

General Reno, how much of a problem

passengers who have been told to exit can be required to

That's not the issue before the

7

under the Fourth Amendment.

8

QUESTION:

So that this is a prolonged seizure.

9

GENERAL RENO:

It is not a prolonged seizure

10

because this Court in Berkemer has referred to traffic

11

stops.

12

to a brief, temporary stop, and under those circumstances

the officer should be able to see the person as they exit

It can, and the Court has

20

recognized that is usually of that duration, but that is a

limited duration in which the police officer can have the

23

2

submit, ought to be able to control that situation so he

3

can first determine the risk to him before the person

departs.
QUESTION:

5

Let's assume for the sake of argument

6

that we do not adopt the rule that goes as far as you have

just suggested it should, that -- let's assume our --

8

under our rule, once the passenger is out of the car, if

9

the passenger wants to go, he can.
If that is the limit of the detention allowed,

10

different -- is the situation of the passenger

In that situation, if the person were free to

go, again the officer would have the opportunity to

the same question that I asked Ms. Reno?

Let's assume that the bright line rule allowed

Okay, but I'm not sure that responds

to my question, because my question is, if the bright line

MR. WARNKEN:

1

Justice Souter, I think that would

be different.

3

in the arrest scenario, where you are arresting one

individual, the other people have nothing to do with that

5

and simply you're using the crowd control of letting them

6

not join where you are, if you will.

The reason that would be different is that

normally be able to walk up and down the sidewalk.

14

That person can go back the 12 feet or whatever

15

and say, I don't want to stay here any longer, and walk

16

away, but at least within a certain zone in which the

17

officer is operating, the officer can control people who

18

come along, and those people who come along are no more or

19

less innocent, I suppose, than the passenger, so why

20

shouldn't the passenger be in the same boat with the

21

bystander?

22

MR. WARNKEN:

Justice Souter, on first blush it

23

may appear that those situations are similar.

reason they are different is that the passenger, once

vague, and seems to extend discretion to the officer.

Mr. Warnken, I think that General

Curran told us that the more usual practice is to tell the

people you must stay inside.

Keep the people in the car.

I just want to make it clear.

In

your view, the passengers have a right to exit whether --

even if the officer does not want them to?
MR. WARNKEN:

in that there is --

QUESTION:

Justice Kennedy, that is correct,

I'm not sure we're just --we have to

11

decide that case here, but it -- I'd like to know what the

12

rule would be.

That, it seems to me very -- could be very

3

dangerous to the officers.

4

we're getting out to see what's going on here, you've got

5

two or three doors opening -- I think that would be a very

dangerous rule.

7

MR. WARNKEN:

Or if he was to say, well,

Justice Kennedy, let's examine the

8

continuum.

I think that in that this Court must balance,

9

in that this Court has already held that there is a

20

legitimate and weighty interest in public safety for the

21

officer, that's the one side of the equation.

22

The other side of the equation for balancing,

23

Your Honors, is where must the Fourth Amendment and where

24

must the individual interests of the individual be

25

balanced to accommodate that need.

And what we are saying, Your Honors, is that the

one place this Court's prior case law would not let that

potential problems with that as the law is that brief to

defer to the natural steps that an officer must take to

So what's your line, then?

You say he can keep him in if he has

MR. WARNKEN:

Sure.
Your Honor, I was saying Justice

Scalia, in this case --

13

QUESTION:

Ah.

MR. WARNKEN:

-- because we already have plenty

of case law that if there is any evidence of officer

But what is that any evidence?

I

mean, here there was evidence that the officer testified I

saw the passenger, and even more so the person in the back

movements.

Honor's implicit statement as part of that that on this

record --

QUESTION:

But I would like to know what would

be sufficient, since you said that a passenger fidgeting,

ducking, making ducking motions, that wouldn't be

7

sufficient.

8

to apprehend the passenger?

9

What would be sufficient to allow the officer

MR. WARNKEN:

Justice Ginsburg, I did not

10

necessarily mean that that would be insufficient, because,

11

Your Honor, if the trial judge had on this record

12

determined that there was reasonable suspicion under Terry

13

v. Ohio and its progeny, on this record, probably on

14

appeal that would not have been found to be clearly

15

erroneous.

QUESTION:

Well, you see, that -- part of that

illustrates that -- and sometimes bright line rules

actually help our citizens.

19

If we rule in your favor, and it becomes

generally known the Supreme Court says you do not have to

get out of car, and then there are some ducking motions

and the officer says, out, and the citizen says I don't

have to get out, what do we have?

fully accommodate the legitimate and weighty interest of

Fourth Amendment interests of the individual.

QUESTION:

You mean Terry --

-- it would be case -- it would be

have said, that's enough for Terry, and another judge

diversity in practice.

QUESTION:

Well, it might be the first time that

2

we did it, but I'm not sure that it would be much of an

3

innovation, if at all, because it seems to me that the

4

argument you're making, and in particular in your response

5

to Justice Breyer's last question, you're saying in effect

6

that an officer who stops a car on a highway has less

7

capacity to control the people around him who might hurt

8

him or interfere with what he is validly doing than he

9

does if he makes an arrest in a public shopping mall.

10

And if I'm wrong, tell me, but it seems to me

11

you said he couldn't make him stay in the car, he couldn't

12

make the passenger get out of the car, the passenger

13

basically would have total freedom -- in the absence of a

14

Terry suspicion, articulable suspicion, the passenger

15

would have total freedom to decide what to do.

16

If I'm walking down the street outside this

17

Court and an arrest is going on, I presume I don't have

18

complete autonomy to decide whether to walk up to the

19

officer or between the officer and the person who's

20

getting arrested and circle the scene, so why isn't it the

21

case that on your answer the officer is in a worse

22

position if he stops a car on the highway than if he makes

23

an arrest on the sidewalk?

5

MR. WARNKEN:

Justice Souter, the officer

6

probably would have that authority, because, Your Honor,

7

in the alternative to our asking you to draw no bright

8

line at all, what this Court could do to fashion the rule

9

would be to say, all of our continuing case law exists

10

wherever we have any evidence of reasonable suspicion or

11

fear of officer safety, and in addition, we will do as we

12

did in cases like Florida v. Wells and United States v.

We will say that even when there is no evidence

on that record, we will defer to the expertise of

There are a myriad of situations, and in fact we

officer when that individual is in the line of duty, it

will be when we are driver or a passenger in a vehicle.

We don't have the constable in the way we once

May I ask if -- I just don't remember

your brief well enough.

that Justice Souter gave you about maintaining order near

Do you discuss the hypothetical

an arrest scene?

21

MR. WARNKEN:

22

QUESTION:

No, Justice Stevens.

Isn't the proper distinction there --

23

and I'd just like you to comment on it, because I've

24

trying to think it through as he raised the question --

25

that in that situation nobody's seized?

They're told to

1

stay away.

In your situation, the passenger is seized.

2

He's told to stay where he is, which is a very -- at least

3

analytically a different concept.

4

MR. WARNKEN:

5

QUESTION:

Justice Stevens, that's correct.

I had not understood Justice Souter's

6

hypothesis -- I thought his hypothesis you can be told to

7

get out of the car but you can't be detained.

8

out of the -- once you've complied with that request,

9

you're free to leave, unless there's -- there is some

10

Once you're

Terry suspicion.
QUESTION:

11

I didn't express that when I put the

12

hypo to you as distinct, I think, from the way I put it to

13

Ms. Reno, but that's what I was assuming, that the

14

passenger could go if he wanted to.
But if the passenger chose to stay at the scene,

15
16

the officer could say either, you stay in the car or you

17

get out.

18

That was the hypothesis that I -QUESTION:

Well, that's the hypothesis I was

19

talking about, too, because by giving that order the

20

police officer is exercising control to tell the person

21

where to be at that particular moment by getting out of

22

the car where he would rather stay in, but that's not true

23

of the bystander who can't approach the scene.

Souter, I certainly concede to this Court that were this

Court to fashion a rule saying, State of Maryland, we

2

reject your absolute, bright line, unlimited, unfettered

3

discretion in all circumstances, but we will draw a line

4

that would permit unfettered discretion, meaning a bright

5

line to the limited extent of having the passenger exit

the vehicle, and then the passenger having the complete

7

discretion whether to get back into the vehicle, whether

8

to leave, or any other reasonable steps the officer would

9

take -QUESTION:

10

Well, how about getting

11

identification of who the passenger is and where they

12

could be reached if they're needed to be a witness?

13

MR. WARNKEN:

Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, I

14

think the case law from this Court already would probably

15

give an officer, if that officer had reason to believe

16

that an individual were a witness to the crime, to try to

17

seek that information.

18

QUESTION:

Well, we're talking about a traffic

19

stop.

20

or making a wrong turn, or something like that.

21

Obviously, the passenger is a witness to speeding,

MR. WARNKEN:

Justice O'Connor, that is correct,

22

which is why I stated earlier that this Court could

23

fashion a line between the one end of the spectrum that we

24

would like to see, which is, you need reasonable suspicion

25

in each case, and the other end of the spectrum that the

1

State of Maryland asks for, which is, you need nothing and

2

anything, to say, the line is as follows:

3

Our existing case law applies.

Any reasonable

4

suspicion of any wrong activity or officer's safety, of

5

course the officer can then take reasonable steps; in

6

addition, take all of these hypos that we discussed today

7

and defer that back to the law enforcement agencies for

8

them, based upon their expertise, just like you did in

9

Sokolow, just like you did in Wells, for them to say,

10

based upon their experience as experts in the area, what

11

are the kinds of situations that truly create a heightened

12

caution that would permit some type of activity,

3

notwithstanding the failure to have any facts in that

4

particular case.

5

And in fact that's what this Court did when this

6

Court ruled unanimously in Wells that it was not proper to

7

do an inventory search when there was simply no guidance

8

from the agency to the individual officers.

9

referred it back, and since then agencies have had no

This Court

20

problem examining those scenarios and coming up with

21

situations just like agencies have since Sokolow in the

22

profile cases.

23

What are the kinds of situations, based on its

24

experience as a law enforcement agency, that makes it

25

reasonable in the following circumstances, following types

1

of situations, the following is likely?
This Court has consistently given deference to

2

3

administrative agencies, their expertise in the area, and

4

we are not suggesting that be any different.

5

What we are suggesting, Your Honor, is, when you

6

weigh out the interest of law enforcement and safety and

7

you weigh out individual rights, you can't give

8

standardless, unlimited discretion to individual officers.

9

The best you should do is to give that discretion to

10

administrative agencies.
QUESTION:

11

Which might be different in every

12

State, and suppose -- are you saying that if Maryland had

13

a manual and said, after 5:00 p.m., it's beginning to get

14

dark, the officer at that time can order the passenger

15

out, and then if they had that rule, then we would defer

16

to it and your client would legitimately have been asked

17

to get out because it was after 5:00?

MR. WARNKEN:

Justice Ginsburg, that is probably

19

correct.

20

laboratories, and we know that in inventory search cases,

21

we know that in profile cases, basically that's what this

22

Court has done now.

This Court has recognized the 50 little

23

24

anything individualized in that case, if you can draw

QUESTION:

1

Which would mean that if that's what

2

your answer is, that all they need is a manual that says

3

after 5:00 this is okay, then the next client like yours

4

loses, because in -- with your client it wasn't a question

5

of detention.

6

contraband exited with him, right?

7
8

When your client exited the car the

MR. WARNKEN:

It -- yes, Your Honor.

Yes,

Justice Ginsburg.
If Your Honors were to draw the line, for

9
10

example where Justice Souter was suggesting earlier, or

11

raising as a possibility earlier, of simply exiting, and

12

then if this Court later decided that in fact that was

3

such as to be reasonable, then in fact that would be

4

permissible.
But of course, Your Honor, these standards that

5
6

would be made by agencies, just like the profile cases

7

today, would, of course, be subject to review as to

8

whether they were unreasonable and extended too much or

9

not sufficient guidance to individual officers.

QUESTION:

General Curran, can you tell me why

we -- I resent being put in the position of deciding this

case on speculation, as lawyers sometimes -- you look at

the ceiling well, if we do this, this will happen.

You're telling us that it will increase police

safety if we adopt this automatic rule.

None of the

9

briefs -- and there's a brief here by 20 States or so --

10

make any attempt to compare the assaults on police in the

11

States that have the rule you're urging us to adopt and

the States that don't have that rule, and that's the

crucial question.

police across the Nation to order the driver out, and

2

since some 25 jurisdictions have believed that Mimms also

conveys to the passengers, we do have data that shows that

4

the percentage of deaths in traffic incidents have been

5

reduced from about 30 percent to somewhere around

13 percent, so there is an inference that Mimms and its

progeny within the States has, in fact, worked.
