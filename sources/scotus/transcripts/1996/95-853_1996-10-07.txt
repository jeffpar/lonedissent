ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. McDUFF:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
As a result of an order of the Chancery Court of

10
11

Benton County, Mississippi, my client is no longer the

12

mother to her children in the eyes of the law.

13

way she can become their mother again under the law is

14

through the appeal that is available as a matter of right

15

under Mississippi law.

The only

The question in this case is whether the supreme

16
17

court of Mississippi can, consistent with the Fourteenth

18

Amendment, prevent her from taking that appeal in a case

19

of this magnitude without even considering her claim that

20

she is too poor to pay the $2,300 fee that the State has

21

imposed.

22

QUESTION:

When you say, Mr. McDuff, considering

23

her claim, what do you suggest would be the factors that

24

the supreme court of Mississippi would take into

25

consideration if it were to "consider it," as you say?

Which suggests, you know, if the

greater includes the lesser we can abolish the appeal

19

entirely, why can't it simply provide, we'll give appeals,

but not if the State has to put in any money, and we're

21

not going to give it to impecunious litigants?

MR. McDUFF:

Well, for the same reason expressed

in the majority opinions in Griffin and the long line of

24

cases that have followed Griffin.

MR. McDUFF:

1

That's true. Your Honor, but in,

2

for example, Lindsey v. Normet, which is a civil case,

3

this Court expressed the same principle that, if -- once

4

the right of appeal is provided by a State as a means of

5

promoting accuracy and as a means of correcting errors and

6

correcting injustices, it cannot be taken away in an

7

arbitrary fashion, and that's our argument here, is that

8

the interest in this case is so important that the same

9

principle should apply here that applies in Griffin and -QUESTION:

10

Payment is an arbitrary fashion?

11

mean, gee, so much of what happens in the world is

12

determined upon whether you can pay for it or not.

13

that an arbitrary fashion?

14

MR. McDUFF:

Why is

Certainly, but this is different

15

than someone who comes along and says well, I want the

16

Government to pay for something I can - - I want to

17

purchase on the free market, whether it's a car, or

18

whatever.

19

I

This is where a citizen has been brought into

20

the court system for the sole purpose of attempting to

21

terminate her relationship with her children, and she is

22

thereby subject to all of the power of the State.

23

and subject to the court system that has the unique

24

ability to terminate forever her relationship with her

25

children.

Now --

1

Now, in Mississippi, as in most States, the

2

State has chosen to provide a level of accuracy and a

3

level of corrective review for errors and injustices

4

through its appellate courts, but my client is being told,

5

because she's poor, she can't take advantage of that,

6

while those who have money can.

7

QUESTION:

How about a custody proceeding, a

8

child custody proceeding?

9

same argument if she had lost in a custody battle?

10

MR. McDUFF:

Would you be here making the

I don't think -- I don't think that

11

argument would have the same weight we have here because

12

of the difference.

13

even though the child may leave the home, the parent can

14

still visit with the child.

15
16

I mean, when a person loses custody,

QUESTION:

Well, maybe the custody order doesn't

provide for visitation.

communicate, to play a role in the child's life, and in

22

the future, if conditions change, the parent can petition

23

for visitation or petition for custody.

MR. McDUFF:

QUESTION:

6

MR. McDUFF:

Yes.
-- between the -Yes, I --- this case and a custody case?
Yes, I do, Your Honor, and one

7

example is Santosky v. Kramer, where this Court held that

8

in parental termination cases, because of the severity,

9

because of the finality and the irrevocability, a clear

10

and convincing evidence standard was necessary before

11

terminating parental rights.
In Mississippi, the Mississippi legislature

12

13

adopted that after this Court's decision in Santosky, but

14

Mississippi has not adopted, and other States have not,

15

for that reason adopted a clear and convincing standard

16

when the State seeks to take custody from parents without

17

terminating their rights.

18

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish Harris v.

19

McRae, where the Court was dealing with a medically

20

necessary abortion for an indigent woman?
MR. McDUFF:

21

The distinction I think there,

22

Justice O'Connor, is that in Harris the citizen wanted an

23

abortion paid by the Government that she would be

24

receiving on the free market of something she chose to

25

obtain.

circumstances were that it was medically necessary.

MR. McDUFF:

Yes, but it was done through the

governmental program of medicaid, is what the citizen was

seeking.
Here, by contrast, where the -- the petitioner

has been brought into the court system, where the State

has set up the exclusive mechanism for terminating her

parental rights, and all she is asking is that she receive

power, but we are basing it in part.
The difference between our case and the case you

3

cite, I think, is the fact that housing and ownership of

4

land does not have the same constitutional status as the

5

relationship with one's children, and this Court said that

6

in Lindsey v. Normet, I think, when talking about how

7

housing does not have the sort of constitutional magnitude

8

that exists in other cases like this.

9

QUESTION:

You think that's right?

10

QUESTION:

And why is that?

11

QUESTION:

Yes, I was about to ask, why --

12

QUESTION:

Why is that?

13

QUESTION:

Why doesn't it have the same

constitutional magnitude?
MR. McDUFF:

It sounds important to me.

Oh, certainly it's important, but I

16

think that -- I think this Court's long line of decisions

17

have noted that family relationships between children and

18

parents are of a much greater constitutional magnitude,

19

and the notion of liberty --

20

QUESTION:

You mean to tell me that if I am --

21

let's say I am dismissed by an employer allegedly for

22

sexual abuse of a child committed to my care as an

23

employee, my reputation is ruined, I pay millions of

24

dollars in damages in a civil suit, I am unemployable in

MR. McDUFF:

Less of a - -- than we have here.
Less of a case than -Yes, less of an argument.
-- here?
Oh, yes.

I think less of an

10

argument, because the right here -- for example, in the

11

case you just posit, Justice Scalia, if someone goes into

12

court and tries to take away some privilege of a person

13

because of these types of accusations, as long as they're

14

not criminal - -

15

QUESTION:

Is that right?

16

MR. McDUFF:

-- there's no clear and convincing

17

evidence standard.

18

19

counsel, has held the determination of parental rights

20

works a grievous harm that is unlike no other save,

21

perhaps, involuntary incarceration.

but that it's true?

2

MR. McDUFF:

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

Oh.

You distinguish in response to

5

Justice O'Connor the custody case from the deprivation

6

permanently of parental status on the basis of the

7

permanence of the latter.

8

parental relationship?

9

Well, what about establishing

What about paternity proceedings?

Suppose there's a finding of paternity in a

10

district, in a lower court, is the defendant in that case,

11

by your reasoning, because of the permanence of that

12

determination, entitled to a free transcript?

13

MR. McDUFF:

I think paternity is much closer to

14

what we have here.

Now, there's one difference, and I'm

15

not -- I don't know this in detail, but my understanding

16

is that now, with the new DNA technology, that paternity

17

can be established or disestablished with something close

18

to certainty, so that the -- I think the court can take

Is it -- would you make any

distinction between the two?

I think paternity is very close to

I -So that if we hold for you, then when

the next case is paternity, we have to hold that too?
MR. McDUFF:

I think -- I think one distinction

17

would be that in a parental termination case you do have a

18

constitutionally imposed standard of clear and convincing

19

evidence in which appellate review -- in which there is a

20

role for appellate review in assuring that is carried out,

21

as opposed to the parental termination, where you do not

22

have a -- I mean, as opposed to the paternity, where you

23

do not have a constitutionally imposed standard, and I

24

note in this connection a number of times this Court has

25

said that, for example, in the punitive damages cases,
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

1

that where a State establishes appellate review, it can

2

play a role in protecting constitutional rights, and so I

3

think that argument exists here that wouldn't exist in the

4

paternity case with respect to the level of evidence

5

that's required.
QUESTION:

6

Well, do you want to take that as a

7

general rule, that whenever the constitution is said to

8

impose a higher burden of proof, that the right to sort of

9

economic equality in the vindication of one's position is

10

going to follow?
MR. McDUFF:

11
12

I think that is certainly a way the

Court could draw the line in future cases.
Now, again though, we are not asking for

on the appeal?
MR. McDUFF:

Well, I think because of the

3

reasoning this Court expressed in the majority opinion in

4

Ross v. Moffitt.

5

I mean, the Equal Protection Clause.

Although that wasn't the context of the criminal

6

case, I think the reasoning is applicable here, that the

7

Equal Protection Clause does not give a person the right

8

to duplicate the legal arsenal of a wealthier person in

9

presenting the case, but it does, the Fourteenth Amendment

10

does give a right to present the case in the first place

11

where the interest is important and where the State has

12

set up these mechanisms for promoting accuracy and for

13

correcting injustices.

14

The --

15

QUESTION:

If we find that the Equal Protection

16

argument you make is unavailing, that is to say that it is

17

not unreasonable to make this distinction, does that not

necessarily determine also the invalidity of your due

19

process argument?

20
21

I mean, I take it you're making a due process
argument as well as an equal protection argument.

MR. McDUFF:

Court's majority opinion in Evitts v. Lucey, describing

8

the Griffin line, where it said the due process claim is

based on the fact that the State has set up these

the Griffin line of cases has employed both

10

11

therefore the State acts arbitrarily towards a citizen

reasonable for equal protection purposes, that's --

17

MR. McDUFF:

I mean, you do have a point in the

sense that in the Griffin line the two have gone together,

20

if the State has set this up, and if the

21

State is telling a person that it should -- that it has

made these - - this level of review available and then - - I

MR. McDUFF:

I think we could.

I don't think it

would be as strong an argument, but yes,

as Mississippi supreme court requires a transcript to

So that it seems to me you're not within the due

stand or fall on equal protection.
MR. McDUFF:

11

I don't think so, I mean, because

12

the fact that the State says yes, you have to have a

13

transcript in the beginning to take the appeal is simply a

14

procedural rule that it imposes, and because it conditions

15

it on this $2 payment per page to a court reporter, I

16

think it is the same sort of barrier that you would have,

17

and that's why I think Griffin and its -- that line of

18

cases went off not only on equal protection but on due

19

process.
QUESTION:

20

Mr. McDuff, as a practical matter,

21

what is the difference between a decree of nonparenthood,

22

as in this case, and a decree as sometimes occurs in cases

of no visitation rights, no custody and no visitation

MR. McDUFF:

The parent who is denied custody

conditions change, and depending on the order may still be

4

able to have some contact with the child over the

5

telephone, or letters, or still participate in decisions.

QUESTION:

Well, that would happen here.

Just

7

because the State declares you're a nonparent doesn't mean

8

you vanish.

9

I assume you could still --

MR. McDUFF:

It does mean that you are erased

10

could allow the children to visit with you, but

MR. McDUFF:

MR. McDUFF:

Oh, that's correct, but I think

MR. MOORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this case is whether or not the

6

State is going to have to subsidize the cost of appeal of

7

an indigent appealing termination of parental rights, and

8

we contend that it does not either on due process or equal

9

protection grounds.

10

From a due process point of view, previous

11

longstanding decisions of this Court have held that

12

appellate review is not necessary for due process

13

purposes, and as to the equal protection claim, this

14

doesn't fit within any of the recognized equal protection

15

type claims.

16

First of all, there's no disparate treatment

17

among litigants.

18

Everybody's required to prepay the cost of the appeal.

19

Everybody's treated the same.

Second, there's no suspect class involved,

20

because previous opinions of this Court have held that the

21

poor are not a suspect class for equal protection purposes

22

even when fundamental rights are involved.

23

And third, there's no impingement of a

24

fundamental right in this case because the only

25

interference with the parent-child relationship is the

1

statute that allows the State to terminate parental rights

2

under certain circumstances.

3

The only issue in this case is what procedural

4

due process must be provided prior to that termination,

5

and that either goes back to a Mathews analysis of whether

6

or not the proceedings that are provided are fundamentally

7

fair, and then it would seem the question --

QUESTION:

May I ask just one question?

It is

true, is it not, that the child has to be represented

10

separately in the proceeding?

11

MR. MOORE:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And that's a matter of due process,

13

too, I would suppose, because the child's rights are as

14

vitally affected as either set of parents.

MR. MOORE:

QUESTION:

The statute requires -At least the statute does require it,

what if the guardian -- I know it's -- it would be an

20

unusual case, but what if the guardian took the position

21

that the natural mother was a better parent and wanted to

22

appeal an adverse decision, would the guardian have to

advance the transcript cost?

accepted, I don't know.

13

It seems to me there might be an argument to

Would it be wrong for the court to

say that a guardian is entitled to an attorney, the child

fundamental right is at issue here in the case when you

MR. MOORE:

We would concede that the parent -

to be a fundamental interest.

18

However, in this case we question whether or not

there is a fundamental right at this point in the

QUESTION:

It may be -- what did the Court --

4

why did the Court say that as a matter of the Federal

5

Constitution, in order to deprive a parent of parental

6

status, the proof standard that the -- that must be met is

7

clear and convincing?
MR. MOORE:

8

9

I assume that the interest were

considered somewhat more than the normal.

I don't

10

remember specifically from the case whether or not it

11

specifically deals with that.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if the Court said that because

13

there is a fundamental interest at stake, that is, the

14

parent-child relationship is a fundamental interest --

15

let's assume that's what the Court said, as I think it

16

did -- then the parent's loss at the trial level doesn't

17

mean the interest is changed, as Justice O'Connor

18

suggested.

19

The interest remains the same.
MR. MOORE:

Well, again, my argument is based on

20

those line of cases that talk about the biological

21

connection alone is not sufficient to raise any interest,

22

and the parent's conduct determines that, so when you have

23

a trial court determining that the conduct of the parent

24

is such that the parental right should be terminated, then

25

it would seem like at that point the presumption of a

that supported the Court's statement that this higher

Yes,

So the appellate review is similarly

an extra check.

Theoretically, any appeal would be

in Ross v. Moffitt, too, where you petition for certiorari

MR. MOORE:

that this is a
Then the equal

I would disagree with that, because

7

I think that it's not an impingement of the parent-child

8

relationship, and it's certainly not a direct and

9

substantial impingement, which the Zablocki case and

10

others require for this kind of constitutional violation.

11

It's purely the procedural matter as to what procedures

12

they're entitled to, and in the procedural analysis in the

13

Mathews case, the interest of the parent is taken into

14

consideration in the first part of that balancing test.

15

We've taken the position that in effect what

16

petitioner is doing here is either attempting to extend

17

Boddie v. Connecticut to the appellate level, or

18

attempting to find an exception to the Ortwein case and,

19

based on their arguments, they seem to be making a purely

our case not with Boddie but with Griffin, that we think

2

that the impact on our client, permanent deprivation of

3

parental status, ought to be treated the same as a

4

criminal conviction, that there's no other civil case like

5

that that declares a woman a nonparent.
MR. MOORE:

6

Well, I think based on the use of

7

the Griffin case and what you're arguing for the rights,

8

it's very hard to distinguish between fundamental rights

9

at that point, so you get into a situation of having to

10

kind of do a hierarchy of fundamental rights and then

11

decide where you cut off the appeals and where you don't.
QUESTION:

12

But we asked the petitioner that

13

question, and the answer was, there's only one other thing

14

that the petitioner would put in that same box, and that's

15

civil commitment, involuntary civil commitment, so now you

16

want them - - you want to make their argument something

17

that they are not attempting to do with it.

18

MR. MOORE:

I'm saying that that argument would

19

be very hard to implement.

I think it implicates other

20

things.

21

separate the one from the other interest.

22

this would be, I think, that other courts would end up

23

interpreting this to include other fundamental rights and

24

other important rights, and in that regard, in the 1995 in

MR. MOORE:

Yes.

If it could be established

MR. MOORE:

Yes.
I would disagree with what the trial

22

judge would do, because I think trial judges take these

23

things very seriously, and I don't think that they would

24

terminate the mother's rights, regardless of the

25

situation, unless they felt it was absolutely justified

attempting to do here is create a vast new constitutional

right and further federalize domestic relations law, and

we submit that that shouldn't be done in the absence of

clear constitutional violation, and we further submit that

there's been no showing or evidence that a clear

constitutional violation exists in this case.

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT B. McDUFF

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. McDUFF:

15

Justice O'Connor, I believe it was in response

16

to questions from you that the Attorney General's Office

17

gave figures about the number of filings of termination

18

cases in the chancery court, and those figures are at page

19

28 of their brief, but those figures are not in the

20

sources they cite on page 28, and we have not seen any

21

such figures about the number of parental termination

22

filings in chancery courts or in the appellate courts.

23

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

The Mississippi supreme court does keep figures,

24

and we've cited them in our brief, as have our opponents,

25

on the numbers of custody appeals, of which parental

custody cases decided by the Mississippi supreme court and

another six decided by the intermediate court of appeals.

Mr. McDuff -Yes.

It deals with status.

Should we apply the same rule to a

That's final.

No, sir, and a divorce also is

something actually that can be remedied in the future if

11

people want to remarry, plus they can continue to have

Your reason has to be

The person who's want it fully wants it.
If a State -- I gather most of the States, maybe

all of them now, have effectively no-fault divorce, but

No, I don't think so.

I mean, I

1

don't think that involves nearly the kind of termination

2

of an intimate relationship beyond the control of the

3

parent that you have, or beyond the control of the party

4

involved that you have when a child is taken away against

5

your will by State action.

QUESTION:

Well, I thought that was the

rationale of Boddie, that divorce did.
MR. McDUFF:

The rationale of Boddie, as I

understand it, is that divorce, because it involves a

10

marriage relationship, is very important, and because the

11

State has an exclusive monopoly on it, that filing fees

12

that freeze people out are unconstitutional, so I think

13

there is a high status and an important interest here, but

14

I don't think it comes to the kind of grievous injury

15

that's done here.

16

QUESTION:

So cutting off a parental relation is

17

a "fundamental" interest, and a right to get a divorce is

18

high, but not fundamental?

19

MR. McDUFF:

No, I didn't -- no, I'm sorry, I

20

don't mean to sort of do a gradation there, but in Boddie

21

the people were married and wanted access to the State-

22

created apparatus for obtaining a divorce, and this Court

23

said they can't be frozen out by a certain amount of

24

money, and when you're talking about appeal, I do think

25

that is different.

QUESTION:

1

Well, but you have to do a gradation,

or then Boddie is going to come out the same way as your

case, isn't it, and we'll have transcripts in all divorce

cases.

QUESTION:

11

No - -

And so I think you have to have a

hierarchy, or a gradation.
MR. McDUFF:

12

And I guess that's what we're

13

saying, is that because of the nature of the harm here as

14

compared to whatever happens in a divorce proceeding, that

15

this is the kind of thing where a transcript will be

16

required and it might not there.

QUESTION:

On the theory that children are more

18

important than spouses to the individuals involved, is

19

that the theory that causes you to put this on a lower

level?

21

MR. McDUFF:

No, on the theory that a divorce

22

decree, or the resolution of a divorce case, involves all

23

kinds of complicated mechanisms that the parties have a

24

right to effect in terms of their interrelationship, but
