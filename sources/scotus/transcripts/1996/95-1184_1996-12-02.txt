ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN JENKINS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JENKINS:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, respondents' challenge on First

11
12

Amendment grounds, payments toward advertising designed to

13

promote the products that they offer for sale, whether

14

they're measured under the integrated bar and union line

15

of cases that we believe is appropriate, or under the

16

Central Hudson test for restrictions on commercial speech,

17

the generic advertising programs pass constitutional

18

muster.

19

here is most analogous to the integrated bar and union

20

context.

21

In our view, the regulatory framework at issue

This Court has applied the Central Hudson test

22

where Government has restricted or prohibited the

23

dissemination of truthful commercial information, but the

24

marketing order provisions at issue here do not ban,

25

suppress, or restrict respondents' speech in any way.

QUESTION:

2

stage, Mr. Jenkins?

3

that you didn't -- that the Government didn't argue that

4

the Abood line or the union line cases wasn't argued in

5

the Ninth Circuit because of the Cal-Almond decision in

6

that court, but the administrative law judge suggests that

7

the Government at least in that forum said that the Abood

8

line didn't apply, and I'm just wondering if the

9

Government has waived that, if we can't just assume that

10

May I ask a question at an early
I think you take the position here

the Central Hudson test applies --

11

MR. JENKINS:

12

QUESTION:

13

Well, I don't --

-- in light of the posture taken

below.

14

MR. JENKINS:

I don't think so, Justice

15

O'Connor.

In fact, the Government has argued throughout

16

this litigation that these programs satisfy both Central

17

Hudson and the Abood line of cases.
QUESTION:

18

We -- pardon me.

But it does appear that the

19

Government below chose not to urge the Abood line, took

20

that tactic, and I don't know why we should address that

21

here.

22

MR. JENKINS:

Well, Your Honor, I disagree with

23

that characterization of our position below.

24

that in our briefs in the district court in particular we

25

argued expressly that the Abood standard was satisfied and

I believe

1

2

that the Central Hudson test was satisfied.
It is true that we did not argue in the district

3

court or in the court of appeals that that was the only-

4

appropriate test, but I do think that we've argued

5

consistently that both tests are satisfied.

6

of appeals, as you've said, it's true that we were

7

laboring under the adverse precedent in Cal-Almond, where

8

the Central Hudson test was applied, but we did refer to

9

the Frame case from the Third Circuit, which did rely in

part on Abood, so I think that argument is preserved.
QUESTION:

And both of those lines of cases, of

course, deal with the First Amendment, don't they?
MR. JENKINS:

Quite so, Mr. Chief Justice.

That's certainly the case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Jenkins, assuming that we apply

16

one or the other test in a way that requires us to

17

determine the value of the Government's interest, do you

18

claim that the value of the Government's interest depends

19

on a Government concern over and above that of the growers

20

whose products they are advertising, or, on the other

21

hand, do you claim that the Government's interest is

22

essentially derivative, that it's important simply because

23

the growers themselves want to do this, and that desire,

24

that vote in fact on their part establishes its

25

importance?

Which is it?

MR. JENKINS:

1

Well, I think it's the latter,

2

Justice Souter, but I think it's even broader than that.

3

The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act expressly sets

4

out the goals of that statute and of the marketing orders,

5

which include establishing orderly market conditions for

6

the covered commodities.

7

Congress, as in the integrated bar context and

8

as in the union context, has chose to leave in the first
instance to the regulated industry the determination

10

whether, in a particular region, as for a particular

11

commodity, that interest is threatened, but we think that

12

both the overwhelming support by the industry and the

13

record in this case indicate that that interest was

14

certainly implicated here.

15

QUESTION:

But the growers, as I understand it,

16

do not vote in any narrow or specific sense as to whether

17

the interest is threatened.

18

whether they want the advertising program or not, isn't

1

that it?

20

MR. JENKINS:

They simply vote as to

Well, I think that's correct,

21

Justice Souter, but that just is at the core of the

22

Government's interest.

23

would add, the Secretary has to make a determination that

24

private -- that generic advertising would further -- tend

25

to further the interest of the act, that is because in a

Where private industry and, I

1

particular region, under a particular marketing order, the

2

need exists.
QUESTION:

3

Is that how you would explain the --

4

what struck me, at least, as the peculiarity in this case

5

that apparently there are, I guess, peach-growers, for

6

example, in some 30 States, but the only ones who seem to

7

have expressed a need for this advertising scheme are

8

California peach-growers.

Is the explanation for that

that there simply has not been a demonstrated instability
10

in markets elsewhere?
MR. JENKINS:

11
12

Souter, but I'd also like --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. JENKINS:

15

I think that's true, Justice

Does the record support that?
It does not, and let me make clear

the way in which this act operates.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Jenkins, before you do that may I

17

ask you, I think a question that is of a similar basic

18

kind?

1

You latch onto the Abood and Keller cases.

What

20

is the Government interest here that compares to the labor

21

peace or the regulation of the bar?

22

23

orders?

24

bargaining underlies all of this?

25

That's what I don't

Why is it so important that we have these

What purpose that compares with collective

1

first the broader interest is in orderly market

2

conditions.

3

I think the legislative history of the

4

Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the 1954 legislative

5

history of the adoption of promotional programs, and the

6

record of the formal rulemaking that gave birth to the

7

advertising provisions of the marketing orders indicate

8

the economic hardship that results and the economic

9

instability in the Nation as a whole that results when

10

there's wide fluctuation of market prices, when

11

particularly farmers but other elements of the industry --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I could understand that if this

13

was across the board, if you said there this compelling

14

need, and so we do it for all agricultural commodities,

15

but it seems to be rather haphazard.

16

MR. JENKINS:

Well, I think that relates to my

17

answer to Justice Souter's previous question, which is

18

that taking, for example, that one of the proposed

19

disparities is between California-grown peaches and

20

Georgia-grown peaches -- and I think it's important to

21

look at the regulatory framework here, which is commodity-

22

specific, and region-specific.

23

Taking peaches as an example, first, California

24

is responsible for the majority of peaches that wind up on

25

people's shelves, but more importantly, between

two

1

different regions there are vast disparities in labor

2

costs, in quality.
The length of the season in California is much

3
4

longer.

California-grown peaches have a Nationwide

5

market, whereas Georgia-grown peaches are basically

6

locally grown and consumed along the Eastern seaboard.

7

There are transportation costs that are different.

8

are investment costs that are different.

There

But I think the particularized nature,

9
10

commodity-specific nature and region-specific nature of

11

these marketing orders reflects narrow tailoring rather

12

than arbitrariness, but Justice -QUESTION:

13

How can it be narrow tailoring when

14

the -- when in effect the tailoring is done by a

15

nongovernmental entity?

16

you are referring, market-specific, region-specific, is

17

simply done by a vote of the people who are growing the

18

peaches.

19

MR. JENKINS:

I mean, the tailoring to which

Well, that's not entirely true,

20

Justice Souter, insofar as the marketing -- the

21

Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act treats different

22

commodities in different regions differently, but you're

23

certainly correct that it's the industry in the first

24

instance, a supermajority, two-thirds majority producers,

25

that caused the marketing order to come into being.

That's because Congress I think reasonably has

1

2

determined that people in the industry, operating day-to­

3

day, are the best measure of need.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Jenkins --

5

MR. JENKINS:

6

QUESTION:

Pardon me.
-- do we have to believe -- this

7

argument sounds like something time-warped out of the

8

1920's.

9

QUESTION:

The thirties.

10

QUESTION:

Or the thirties.

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

And this is a remnant of the National

13

Industrial Recovery Act when this kind of an argument was

14

made for every industry in the country, and indeed, they

15

tried to have marketing, the equivalent of marketing

16

orders for every industry in the country.

17

not to be true and not to be effective.

18

It was found

Now, do we have to believe it, that somehow it

19

is effective for agricultural marketing orders, but having

20

the Government in cooperation with the industry, the

21

corporate State, it is called, in Italy, as an efficient

22

mechanism for producing economic prosperity?

23

MR. JENKINS:

I think so, Justice Scalia, for

24

two reasons.

2

programs and, in fact, expanded them and made significant

3

factual findings regarding their importance, but -- pardon

me.

MR. JENKINS:

QUESTION:

MR. JENKINS:

Well, I don't think so.

Again, if

I can --

14

I mean, it seems to express the

belief that elsewhere that isn't true.

11
12

Has not done it for every

commodity, that's true.

9
10

I mean,

Congress hasn't done it for everything else.

8

Just for agriculture.

QUESTION:

That market disorder is okay.

Indeed, it's what drives the market.

15

MR. JENKINS:

Well, no, Justice Scalia.

I think

16

the determination first is that there may not be

17

significant market disorder and fluctuation in those

18

industries where -- private industry where producers have

19

not felt a need to invoke the Government's aid, but if I

20

can analogize -QUESTION:

1

wherever they can get it.
MR. JENKINS:

2

Well, I don't think so.

For

3

example, there are a number of commodities for which

4

marketing orders are authorized, but where the industry

5

has not chosen to use them, to ask for them.
In plums, for example, in 1991 the California --

6

7

the aspects of the marketing order that relate to plums

8

were terminated because there was an industry-wide

9

referendum and plum producers found that it was no longer

10

important.
But if I could again analogize to the union

11
12

context, not every workplace is unionized.

13

where a majority of workers feel that a union will

14

effectuate their interest and therefore Congress' interest

15

in labor peace.

16

QUESTION:

It's only

Well, isn't it at least, or couldn't

17

Congress find as a fact that in agriculture, at least

18

since after the First World War, there's always been a

19

problem.

20

if the prices are good, there's virtually no crop.

21

totally different situation from most other kinds of

22

marketed goods.

23

If there's a good crop the prices are low, and

MR. JENKINS:

It's a

We think so, Mr. Chief Justice,

24

and I think particularly as to these commodities that is

25

true.

MR. JENKINS:

You could have marketing

That's certainly true as a

7

technical matter, Your Honor, but it's also true that in

8

adopting both -- in adopting promotional programs Congress

9

found, and in adopting these particular marketing order

10

provisions the Secretary found that these -- the ability

11

to invoke generic advertising activities has a beneficial

12

effect, and in fact directly advances --

13

QUESTION:

What is the test that you say we must

14

apply to determine the validity of this provision

15

requiring advertising?

16

real, substantial harm, and that this is a provision

17

that's narrowly tailored to eliminate it, or is the

18

standard that's applied something far more deferential?

19

MR. JENKINS:

Do we have to find that there is a

Well, Justice Kennedy, I think it

20

is more deferential, but if I could set back for a moment,

21

I think that if certainly this Court were to conclude that

22

regulating these commodities and establishing orderly

23

market conditions in terms of its effect on the national

24

economy was a trivial interest, then the Government would

lose in this case.

MR. JENKINS:

QUESTION:

MR. JENKINS:

I'm sorry, I --

Because speech is involved?
Well, insofar as the First

Amendment rights of handlers are affected, then there must

6

be, I suppose, more than an irrational governmental

interest, but I think there's no question that the

interest here is substantial.

QUESTION:

Mr. Jenkins --

Well, in a commercial speech context

it seems to me that you don't have to establish a very

clear governmental interest in order to prevail.

2

attenuated in several respects, first because it's

on respondent's ability to advertise in any respect, third

7

because --

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you about that.

One

of respondents' complaints is that the 1989 advertising

10

guide promoted a proprietary variety of nectarine, the Red

11

Jim, which is grown exclusively by one of the growers, and

12

a grower who does not want to lease or sell a royalty to

13

that, so Red Jim is grown only by one grower.

Now, do you defend that practice under the -under any test?
MR. JENKINS:

Your Honor, we do, but let me

first say that I think -QUESTION:

That's amazing, that the Government

19

could take money from everybody in the industry, every

20

grower of peaches and nectarines, and advertise one

grower's exclusive use to a patented fruit.

We can overlook that.

MR. JENKINS:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I think

14

it's important to look -- in our, in the Joint Appendix in

15

Volume 2, at page 531, this is the varieties chart to

16

which respondents were referring, and among the list of

21

What is distinctive, the opinion said, about the

free riders who are nonunion members of the union's own

bargaining unit, is that in some respects they are free

riders whom the law requires the union to go out of its

way to benefit even at the expense of its other interests.

In the labor union context, the union has a fiduciary-

2

obligation to every one of the employees, whether they're

union members or not, and sometimes has to sacrifice its

own interest to those obligations.

That is not the case as I understand this

MR. JENKINS:

11

We don't, Justice Scalia, assert

13

representation in this context, although that is similarly

14

true in the integrated bar context, that there is no

15

concomitant duty of fair representation.

QUESTION:

Well, I think the bar is a special

situation, and have always felt that, but as far as unions

go, you have the distinctive fiduciary obligation.

MR. JENKINS:

7

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.

Some of them here say they're being

harmed, that the mere advertising of, generically, peaches

9

harms them because they are trying to convince the public

10

that all peaches are not fungible, that some kind of

11

peaches are really good peaches, and their interests are

12

harmed by any generic peach advertising.

13

MR. JENKINS:

But Justice Scalia, I don't see

14

how that removes this from the Abood line of cases.

15

similarly true that if I'm an employee and I'm opposed to

maternity leave, and the union nonetheless negotiates a

maternity leave clause in our contract, I have no First

Amendment right to prevent that.

The question -- pardon me.

2

important as another, but first is the end important and

3

then, secondly, does the means chosen advance the end, and

4

so I think the record in this case does demonstrate that

5

the end of orderly market conditions and sustained demand

6

for these products is significantly advanced by the means

7

that's chosen, including generic advertising.

9

QUESTION:

But your argument is on that, as I

understand it, that we have generally accepted the

10

proposition that advertising induces people to buy what is

11

advertised.

12

I mean, do you -- there's kind of an assumption

13

as a matter of law that advertising works to some degree,

14

and I will grant you that, but is that enough in a case

15

like this, because it seems to me, number one, that

16

advertise -- the assumption that advertising works doesn't

17

tell us very much about whether the advertising is

18

creating or advancing an orderly market as opposed to a

19

less orderly one, and it doesn't tell us very much about

20

what the difference is between the effect of advertising

21

either on consumption or orderly markets in California and

the failure of advertising with respect to markets

everywhere else.

3

advertising program, are making measurably more money in

an orderly market?

Do -- does the record indicate that?

MR. JENKINS:

5

Justice Souter, let me answer the

6

second part of your question first.

7

about the record.

8

here the Government was defending a particular program,

9

and so the record doesn't reflect, for example, why

10

You asked earlier

I think it's important to note that

Georgia peaches are not regulated.
As I've indicated, there are reasons why

11
12

different markets are treated differently, but the record

13

doesn't reflect it because in our view our burden is to

14

demonstrate that this program satisfies constitutional

15

requirements, and we think that the evidence amply

16

demonstrates first that advertising, generic advertising

17

programs advance the interest of consumer demand for these

18

products, and in fact --

preferences, and I think it's the inevitable -- the

3

conclusion is inevitable that that aids in regulating

market conditions.

Secretary --

6

If the Secretary -- insofar as the

QUESTION:

Well, I -- it regulates only in the

7

sense that it -- we will assume that it creates some

8

demand that would not have been there otherwise.

9

But when we're faced with a situation in which

10

there are in fact contrasting markets, and we want to

11

know, even under a comparatively relaxed standard, what

12

the causal connection is between the advertising and

13

orderly markets, it seems to me sensible to look at the

14

markets where the advertising isn't going on to see if

15

they are depressed or disorderly, and I take it we cannot

16

do that in this case, because the record just doesn't tell

us anything about it.

We don't, Justice Souter, but as

I've said, I don't think we need to know that in order to

answer the question that's at issue here.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Jenkins --

5

QUESTION:

So you're saying -- I'm sorry.

6

QUESTION:

To take a specific case, in this

7

record there's nothing like there was in the case before

8

the Third Circuit, the meat case, where the Court said,

10

that this industry is in disastrous shape, but there's

11

nothing of that kind here, that the peach and nectarine

12

industry is about to fall apart, is there?

13

MR. JENKINS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think

14

the record in the Frame case was quite similar, but the

15

program was somewhat different.

16

The beef program focuses almost exclusively on

17

promotional programs and advertising, and so insofar as

18

Congress perceived a problem and the only thing it did

19

about it was to create promotional advertising programs,

20

the Third Circuit concluded correctly, we think, that

21

there was a problem existing that Congress sought to

address.

are you telling me that the record from Congress is

MR. JENKINS:

10

I think it is comparable, but I

11

want to be specific, because I don't want to mislead the

12

Court.

13

Congress made findings both in 1937, when it

14

adopted the act, and then in 1954, when it added

15

promotional programs, not advertising specifically.

16

Congress subsequently added advertising as among the

17

promotional programs, and we think Congress was not

required to make additional findings, as when it had

already indicated what it found promotional programs to

accomplish.

problem that your client has that wouldn't be shared by

6

anybody who used to fly on the airlines and had to pay

money in part for messages that they might have disagreed

8

with that would have been spent by the Air Transport

9

Association required by the Civil Aeronautics Board, or

10

exactly the same thing in the utilities industry, or the

11

trucking industry, or any taxpayer who pays taxes which

12

then is spent by the Government on messages they disagree

13

with?

14

In other words, what's the First Amendment

15

interest here that isn't shared in thousands of regulatory

16

situations by millions of members of the public whose

17

money the Government often takes to spend, or have other

18

private people spend, on messages that they might not want

19

to pay for?

MR. CAMPAGNE:

But if we have a system where the industry is

customer of a utility -- I'm just repeating myself, but it

seems to me that there are vast numbers of consumers who

used to have to spend lots of money they didn't want to

spend for messages that regulators would either permit or

require.
MR. CAMPAGNE:

15

The First Amendment issue, Your

16

Honor, is two-pronged.

First of all, they're forcing us

17

to associate with our competitors, and it's not like the

board doesn't have much opportunity to prefer one product

not moot because the regulation never changed that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN JENKINS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JENKINS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'd

like to begin just very briefly by stating that as to the
administration of this program most of the factual
findings that respondent's cite come from the ALJ's
findings on the APA claim against these programs.

Those

were overturned by the judicial officer, who found those
findings as to bias, as to red is better, and what-haveyou, to be clearly erroneous.
Both of the courts below affirmed that holding,
the APA holding, and so I think those findings are simply
out of the case.

The Court need not necessarily ignore

them completely, but no final adjudication has been made
upholding these findings of bias.
If I could turn to the question of the
Government interest here, I think we have demonstrated
that there's a free rider problem that's important and
comparable to the union and integrated bar context, that
in agriculture, and particularly as to these commodities,
there are many small producers who could not engage in the
kind of economies of scale that's available under this
program.
That's not necessarily true in some other
industries.

The record does speak, for instance, to the

1

California almond industry, and this Court has repeatedly

2

held that where Congress finds a problem and deals with it

3

in a way that is constitutionally justifiable, the fact,

4

at least outside of the strict scrutiny context, that it

5

has not chosen to employ those remedies elsewhere does not

6

render unconstitutional its action where it has done so.
QUESTION:

7

Does anything in the law prevent

8

bias?

Does anything in the law -- let's assume that

9

51 percent of the California growers grow red peaches, or

10

red nectarines, or whatever color red things we were

11

talking about.

12

money from being spent with advertisements showing only

13

the red fruit?

14
15

Anything in the law would prevent this

MR. JENKINS:

I think so, Justice Scalia, as a

practical matter.

16

QUESTION:

What provision is that?

17

MR. JENKINS:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. JENKINS:

May I complete my answer?

Yes.
The AMAA provides that the

20

Secretary must find that particular activities are -- tend

21

to effectuate the goals of the act.

22

Marketing Service has guidelines which, for instance,

23

prevent the criticism of other commodities or products, so

24

I think both as a practical matter and as a legal matter

25

there are checks on misuse of this system.
