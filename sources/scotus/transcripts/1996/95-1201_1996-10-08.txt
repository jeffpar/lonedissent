ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOAQUIN G. AVILA

10

12

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
The issue before you is whether a district court

14

having enjoined an unprecleared plan can then order that

15

unprecleared plan into effect.

16

The resolution of this issue is controlled by

17

Clark v. Roemer.

18

an election based upon unprecleared election changes must

19

be enjoined.

20

suspended the operation of section 5, and ordered the

21

implementation of the unprecleared plan.

QUESTION:

Do we know that section 5 necessarily

applies here?

Yes, it does apply.

There can be no

serious dispute that section 5 applies to judicial

elections in Monterey County.

2

QUESTION:

But how about the fact this is

3

basically a State statute, and Monterey, the State of

4

California isn't covered?

5

MR. AVILA:

We are dealing with county

6

ordinances which have consolidated judicial districts

7

starting back in 1969, the date after Monterey County was

8

made subject to the section 5 preclearance provisions.

9

The applicable State statutes refer and

10

incorporate the consolidations that occurred at the county

11

level, so we had a series of county ordinances -- in fact,

12

a total of about 11 -- that started out with two municipal

13

court districts and seven justice of the peace court

14

districts on November 1st of 1968, and ultimately it

15

winded up with a countywide election system in 1983, and

16

so

17

QUESTION:

But I guess you stipulated with the

18

county that it is impossible to prepare an election plan

19

that doesn't conflict with State law and still comply with

20

the Voting Rights Act.

21

MR. AVILA:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

That is correct, Your Honor.
And if that's the case, then how do

you avoid challenging California State law?
MR. AVILA:

Well, at this particular point,

there are still -4

5?

And how do you do that under section

I mean, it's a very confusing case.

3

MR. AVILA:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.
And I really would appreciate your

5

addressing this inquiry that the Chief Justice also

6

inquired about.

7

MR. AVILA:

Although we are dealing with State

8

statute, we are also dealing with county ordinances and a

9

consolidations of judicial districts that occurred over a

10

period of time.

Section 5 requires the county ordinances

11

as well as the State statutes that specifically refer to

12

events or consolidations of the judicial districts in

13

Monterey County, and these State statutes specifically

14

referred to Monterey County.

15

QUESTION:

Well, but if it is the State statute

16

that is the operative law, I think it's just not a case

17

where the Voting Rights Act applied.

18

Surely you wouldn't make the argument if it was

19

the other way around, if the county ordinance mentioned by

20

reference some State law, and then applied -- applied the

21

same rule as a matter of county law.

22

that the fact that it referred to State law lets the

23

county off the hook.

24

MR. AVILA:

25

QUESTION:

You wouldn't say

That's correct, Your Honor, but -So I don't know why it works the

1

other way here.

This is State law we're talking about.

2

The State isn't a covered unit.
MR. AVILA:

3

The reason why it doesn't work is

4

because here, Monterey County has the authority to

5

consolidate judicial districts, and it exercised that

6

authority under State law, and so as a result of those

7

consolidations, there were changes which had to be

8

precleared under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.
Even though you may have had a State statute

9
10

that implicated those consolidations, it nevertheless

11

specifically referred to the consolidations in Monterey

12

County, and in this particular instance, we have a series

13

of county ordinances which the district court back in 1993

14

found had not been precleared and could not be

15

implemented, and until those particular county ordinances

16

are approved, the State statutes, which are dependent and

17

interrelated with those county ordinances, can't come into

18

effect.

QUESTION:

Mr. --

20

QUESTION:

Did State law require Monterey County

21

to consolidate?
MR. AVILA:

It could, but it didn't in this

QUESTION:

consolidation of these local judicial offices.
MR. AVILA:

The State laws that are under review

3

in this particular case did not.

4

was contingent upon the consolidations of three judicial

5

districts in Monterey County, and so it specifically

6

referred to this event that was going to occur in

Monterey --

QUESTION:

MR. AVILA:

QUESTION:

MR. AVILA:

14

QUESTION:

16
17
18

That is -And what is challenged here was

Monterey County's decision to consolidate.

13

15

So you take the position that the

county, Monterey County was free to consolidate or not.

10

12

The 1983 State statute

That is correct.
Which was not mandated, according to

you, by State law.
MR. AVILA:

Under the State laws that are under

review, are not -- they were not mandated.
QUESTION:

And there has never been a

19

determination that there is a substantive violation of

20

section 5 of the Voting Rights Act?

21

MR. AVILA:

That is correct.

22

Now, the only -- this, of course, is just not

23

merely a failure to preclear.

We also have a situation

24

here where, after the district court found these

25

ordinances subject to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act,

1

Monterey County then filed a section 5 judicial

2

declaratory judgment action in Washington, D.C., and

3

subsequent to that filing, we intervened, and as a result

4

of that intervention, as a result of discussion with the

5

Department of Justice, Monterey County decided that it

6

could not meet its burden of demonstrating that several of

7

these county ordinances did not have a retrogressive

8

effect.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. AVILA:

11

QUESTION:

Well, it withdrew that suit, I guess.
It did.
It dropped the suit, and so that

12

leaves us in a posture, as of now, there's been no finding

13

of a substantive violation of section 5.

14

MR. AVILA:

15

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Mr. Avila, you're not making an

16

alternative argument which I would have thought you would

17

have made, and I'm beginning to think that I'm missing

18

something or you would have made it, and the argument

19

would be this.

20

Section 5 refers to a jurisdiction which enacts,

21

or which, I think, implements a plan which has not been

22

precleared, so that even if the county took no independent

23

action, and even if the county were doing nothing but

24

administering State law, wouldn't the second clause of

25

section 5 pick it up, so that it would require

1

preclearment even though it was the result of State law

2

and the State is not, as an entire State, a covered

3

jurisdiction?

4
5

Wouldn't that be enough to create the section 5
violation?
MR. AVILA:

6

Yes, it would, Your Honor.

If you

7

have a State statute that enables the county to take a

8

particular course of action --

9

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not talking about enabling

10

it to take a course of action.

11

state statute that required it to take a course of action,

12

even though the State wasn't covered, and even though the

13

county alone was a covered jurisdiction, by following that

14

State law, the second clause of section 5 would require

15

preclearance, wouldn't it?

16

MR. AVILA:

17

QUESTION:

I'm saying, if you had a

That's correct, it would.
But you say that the State law

18

authorized but didn't require consolidation, is that

19

right?

20

MR. AVILA:

The 1983 State statute was in

21

essence based on a contingency of consolidation of three

22

judicial districts which the county board of supervisors

23

at that point authorized, and duly adopted an ordinance

24

consolidating these three judicial districts, but --

Was the county free, after the

1

enactment of the State statute and after consolidating, to

2

go back to the preconsolidation regime?
MR. AVILA:

3

It was not free under State law to

4

go back to the status quo ante, and the reason why is

5

because the justice of the peace courts were eliminated in

6

1993 under a State proposition, and at the time of 1968,

7

there were two municipal court districts and seven justice

8

of the court -- justice of the peace court districts, and

9

to go back to that procedure was deemed to be unfeasible

10

by the district court, and for that reason the district

11

court found it compelling to issue an order to require an

12

election based on an interim plan for the June 1995

13

election.

14

QUESTION:

And it was also true that there was a

15

State statute that required countywide courts, isn't that

16

correct?

17

MR. AVILA:

18

QUESTION:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Isn't there also a statute, a State

19

statute that requires that the courts be countywide, or am

20

I wrong about that?

21

MR. AVILA:

Under the State statutes and the

22

constitution, State constitution, you could have a

23

countywide municipal court district.

Along -- in addition to that, you could also
have municipal court districts, several municipal court

districts within the county as long as they met certain

2

criteria, as long as they didn't divide municipalities, as

3

long as they contained over 40,000 -QUESTION:

4

Are there such counties in California

5

where you have -- unlike this county that now has just one

6

district, are there counties in California that have

7

multiple judicial districts?
MR. AVILA:

8

There are some counties in

9

California that do have multiple court judicial districts.

10

For example, Los Angeles County, Alameda County, San Diego

11

County.

12

municipal court districts, and Monterey County, back in

13

1968, did in fact have two --

Many of the large urban areas have multiple

15

with that ratified or approved the consolidations is not

17

covered county, is that not right?

18

It's just peculiar to this one

I mean, that law that deals with the

19

consolidation is not like the constitutional provisions

20

that are also in this picture.

21

MR. AVILA:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.
But to the extent that California

23

approved what had been done by the county, that's peculiar

24

to this one covered county.

MR. AVILA:

The State statute specifically

1

refers to Monterey County.

It auth -- the State

2

constitutional provision authorizes the legislature to

3

create countywide municipal court districts, to create

4

multiple municipal court districts if so desired.
In fact, in some of these counties you have --

5
6

in San Diego County, for example, you have a municipal

7

court district that in fact divides municipal boundaries,

8

so there are various variations that are permitted under

9

State law.

10

QUESTION:

As I take it, what this case presents

11

to us is not the question so much what the court should

12

have done, or might have done, but the question of whether

13

what it did do was wrong, and you're saying what it did do

14

was per se wrong.

15

MR. AVILA:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. AVILA:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
It was clear error.
Clear error.
Yes, and that's the only issue before

19

us, I take it.

20

people will have to figure out what to do next.

21

If we agree with you, back it goes, and

MR. AVILA:

That's precisely our point.

If the

22

Court reverses the district court refusal to enjoin its

23

unprecleared election change, then on remand, the district

24

court would then be required to conduct an evidentiary

25

hearing to determine what alternative should be

implemented, because it can't go back to the --

2

QUESTION:

3

thing before the court at the time it acted was the

4

allegation that no preclearance had been obtained, and

5

perhaps the only thing the court could do was just say,

QUESTION:

Well -I mean, at that stage, with no

court do except say, okay, get preclearance?

QUESTION:

3

Are you actually disagreeing?

I

thought your position is, they have to preclear, they

didn't, and under Clark, what a district court is supposed

to when they don't preclear is say, hold everything.

And isn't that what you want to

happen here?

MR. AVILA:

QUESTION:

14

Ordinarily that would be correct.

Yes.
And you're saying he didn't do that,

but under Clark, he should have done it.

15

MR. AVILA:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
You're -- but you have to add one

17

fact to it, extend the terms of judges elected under a

18

plan that the court believes may be unconstitutional.

19

mean, the court was concerned about the constitutionality

20

of the plan under which the judges currently sitting were

21

elected, wasn't it?

MR. AVILA:

Yes, it was, Your Honor.
So that -- that's quite a significant

MR. AVILA:

1

Well, there was ample opportunity

2

that was provided to the district court in order to

3

resolve and address that question.
QUESTION:

But your case, as I understand it,

5

does not depend upon our so assuming, because all you

6

want, in theory, and all -- as I understand it, all that

7

it would take for us to resolve this case, and all that it

8

would have taken for the district court to resolve the

9

case was to order, just as Justice Breyer suggested a

10

moment ago, no election under this plan.
What happens next may be a very serious State

problem, but that's not what you require the district

court to get into.

Isn't that correct?

That is --

Honor.
The reason why at some point -- maybe not at

21

this particular juncture, but the reason why we're here is

22

because there hasn't been preclearance since

23

State and the county have not come forward with a proposed

24

solution since

25

969, and the

993.

position would be different if, instead of the district

2

judge -- instead of saying, well, I think there may be a

3

violation of equal protection under Miller and so forth,

4

if the judge had held a hearing and found that the plan in

5

effect was unconstitutional, then we'd have a different

6

case, wouldn't we?

7

MR. AVILA:

8

QUESTION:

That's correct, and I -Of course, he did not do that, but

they just sort of assumed it might be.
10

MR. AVILA:

And at a minimum we wanted to have

11

an evidentiary hearing so that we could present various

12

alternatives and the district court could then determine

whether in fact the 1

Then why didn't you bring a complaint

I mean, why -- you said you would like to have

had a hearing, but as I understand it, and I may be wrong

on this, you had no pleading before the court claiming

20

that the preceding plan was in fact a violation either of

21

section 2 or of the Fourteenth Amendment.

22

MR. AVILA:

I think it's very important to point

23

out that the plan that we're talking about is the 1

And it is that plan that the

10

MR. AVILA:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So once again, the only thing that

12

the court had before it as a matter of pleading or

13

complaint was a claim that in the absence of that interim

14

precleared plan there was no precleared plan, and

15

therefore no election should be held, isn't that correct?

16

MR. AVILA:

That's correct, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

Do you know in your study of this --

19

it seems to me over the last 30 or 40 years it probably

20

has come up before that some covered district had in place

21

a plan that arguably is unconstitutional.

22

Then, they changed it, and the change has to be

23

precleared, but under Clark, you just keep the status quo

24

until they preclear it, even if that status quo is

25

arguably unconstitutional.

litigation that occurred in the Conner v. Johnson, Connor

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN JENKINS
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE APPELLANTS
MR. JENKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The three-judge court held that the county's
electoral system contained voting changes covered by
section 5 that had never received preclearance.

This

Court's precedents clearly require the district court to
enjoin elections under that plan.
As the Court's questions have indicated, first
and foremost, a so-called local three-judge court's task
is to determine whether changes are subject to
preclearance, have been precleared and, if not, to enjoin
elections under an unprecleared plan.
Justice Breyer, in response to your question, it
has been frequently the case that the status quo ante was
an unconstitutional or otherwise unlawful plan.

For

instance, when Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act, it
understood that a lot of the plans currently in effect
would be unconstitutional either under the Fifteenth or
Fourteenth Amendment, one-person-one-vote violations and
what-have-you, and that for section 5 purposes they could
still serve as the benchmark.
QUESTION:

That --

But Mr. Jenkins, isn't the problem

that this isn't a status quo ante?

I mean, if we were going back to what

it was when they had the district -- whatever, the

5

municipal districts and the justice districts.

it's not that we go back to what was and keep it.

is in -- practically for every point of view you can't

to be a different way.

10

MR. JENKINS:

But here,
There

You can't go back to that old way, so there has

Well, Justice Ginsburg, our

11

contention is not that the district court necessarily

12

erred in rejecting a particular plan, but that the option

13

that it chose of allowing elections to go forward under an

14

unprecleared plan was impermissible under this Court's

15

decisions.

16

We do think that the district court had some

17

remedial alternatives, some flexibility in determining

18

what to do, but that the course that it took was an

19

unlawful choice.

20

QUESTION:

Would we --

QUESTION:

Well, suppose there are two choices,

22

neither of which involves returning to the status quo.

Suppose you cannot return to the status quo.

under an unconstitutional plan based on race.

Which of

those do you take?

Which is the lesser evil?

MR. JENKINS:

Well, Your Honor, clearly, I think

3

if the district court had done the full-blown Miller v.

4

Johnson analysis, determined that the 1994 interim plan

5

was unconstitutional --

6

QUESTION:

Let's assume that that was the case.

7

MR. JENKINS:

Right, and if the only other

8

choice was, if I understand your question, allowing

9

elections under an unprecleared plan --

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. JENKINS:

Then I think elections would have

12

to go forward under the unprecleared plan.

If the

13

Constitution were to come into direct conflict with

14

enforcement of section 5, that would affect the outcome,

15

but I think that's quite far afield from the situation

16

that's presented here, as --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Jenkins, why don't you -- why

18

doesn't your answer go this way, that given the

19

unconstitutionality on the one hand, an unprecleared plan

20

on the other, that in fact everything has got to stop

21

until somebody comes up with a constitutional plan?

22

Now, that somebody may be the district court.

23

If the district court has, in fact, had a complaint

24

register -- or filed with it saying the old plan is

25

unconstitutional, the district court finds that it's

It finds no precleared alternative to

the unconstitutional plan, then it's clear that the

the district court has got the jurisdiction to fashion a

Isn't that the way out of the dilemma?
MR. JENKINS:

I think that's correct, Justice

Souter, but as I understood the hypothetical, the only two

choices were an election under an unprecleared plan --

QUESTION:

Because the third choice is, simply

file a complaint saying the old plan is unconstitutional,

18

let the district court adjudicate it, and the district

court has got remedial authority.
MR. JENKINS:

20

Well, that's certainly correct

under the situation that was actually presented in this

case.

MR. JENKINS:

2

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

3

If I can be clear, there was a system that existed on

4

November 1st, 1968, which has not been claimed to be

5

unconstitutional, but which the district court thought

6

would be difficult or unfeasible to return to.

7

QUESTION:

Because it involved courts that no

8

longer exist in the whole State of California, for one

9

thing.

10

MR. JENKINS:

That's correct, but I think before

11

allowing elections under an unprecleared system the

12

district court was required, among other things, to

13

analyze whether that system, the preexisting '68 system,

14

could have been adapted in some way to accommodate current

15

circumstances.

16

alternatives that were possibilities, as Justice Breyer

17

says, based on the facts of the case.

We think there were a number of remedial

QUESTION:

Did the court have the power to

19

impose any of these remedial alternatives on its own

20

without first making the determination that the extant

21

plan, which would otherwise continue, was

22

unconstitutional?

23

MR. JENKINS:

Well, we think so, Justice Scalia.

24

I mean, the 1994 interim plan was a one-time plan, and the

25

elections had already been conducted under that plan, so

1

there was a question as to what would be the further

2

relief that would be ordered so long as no pre --

3

permanent plan had been precleared, but I think the local

4

court had jurisdiction to make that consideration.

5

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure why, because the

6

court has got jurisdiction to adjudicate a complaint

7

that's brought in front of it.
The complaint brought in front of it says, this

8

9

is an unprecleared plan.

The court can adjudicate that,

10

says it is unprecleared, don't use it.

11

the court, absent some further pleading before it, has got

12

jurisdiction to do anything.

13

I don't see why

If at that point the party says, or some party

14

says, whoops, if we can't use this unprecleared plan, then

15

we've got to decide what's going to happen to the old

16

plan.

If they don't bring a complaint that the old

plan is in fact unconstitutional, then I don't know why

the old plan wouldn't be followed.

claim, it should adjudicate it and stop.

correct, and I agree with you that in order to resolve

19

My point is simply that there was a difficult

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL G. STONE

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

3
4

MR. STONE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

5

The questions posed to Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Avila

6

suggest what the State would have suggested independently,

7

which is that the context of this proceeding is a very

8

important focus as well as the scope of a covered
jurisdiction once it's determined, by virtue of the

10

statutory formula, that a jurisdiction must seek

11

preclearance of voting changes.

12

The nature of this case, as Justice Souter has

13

suggested, is a complaint for declaratory and injunctive

14

relief.

15

the only inquiry in these cases is whether there is a

16

covered jurisdiction, if so, whether that jurisdiction is

17

enacting or seeking to administer a new change which it

18

has initiated affecting voting rights, and then the third

1

question is, did they first obtain the requisite

20

preclearance?

21

It's called a coverage case under section 5, and

So in that sense -- in our briefs we use the

22

word technical.

I understand that that's a confusing,

23

perhaps a misnomer, but it is a procedural question of

24

whether or not they've done the requisite steps to get

MR. STONE:

Well, for several reasons we don't

believe the elections should have been enjoined here.
Under Clark v. Roemer this Court said that there

5

may be extraordinary circumstances in which an injunction

6

would not be appropriate, and it gave an example, which is

7

one in which the action was filed at the eleventh hour,

8

the election processes were already well-advanced, and

9

that there were equitable reasons why the elections should

10
11

be permitted to go forward.
Here, the complaint was filed in 1991, and it

12

was challenging 1968 through 1983 ordinances.

13

the Court made the point that there was no showing that

14

the plaintiffs were not diligent.

15

quite the opposite fact is true.

MR. STONE:

2

Stevens, because the district court -- this Court has

3

held, in defining the different kinds of actions that may­

the only question was coverage, has no jurisdiction to

No, but I'm trying to connect that to

the lack of due diligence that you were referring to.

MR. STONE:

Well, it's the fact that they waited

20 years, permitted a great deal of time in which the

State took several actions with respect to justice and

7

municipal courts in Monterey County, so their diligence --

8

had they filed this action immediately after passage of

the first ordinance, or the second, or the third, and

taken issue with it at the time, then an injunction would

have been against the county, I suppose, at least much

more clearly.

Now, the State has developed law, including the

initiative voted by the entire population of the State, to

eliminate justice courts, and that is in the midst -- one

MR. STONE:

Actually, Your Honor, the State

Mr. Avila was correct that there are municipal courts that

are less than county, but the underlying State interest is

very much that every voting citizen within a judicial

That's why we believe it ordered that there be a one-time

12

District of Columbia, and we're not the section 2 court,

13

meaning all these stipulations --

14

QUESTION:

But don't you think that the reason

15

the district judge thought Miller invalidated the plan, or

16

its interim plan, was because the district judge thought

17

that any reliance on race in fashioning the districting

18

would be invalid?

19

MR. STONE:

The district court did say that

20

Miller draws into question whether any reliance on race

21

may be invalid, but it didn't go that far.

22

QUESTION:

So do you think it's up to us to

23

decide whether the district court correctly or incorrectly

24

construed Miller?

MR. STONE:

Your Honor, I think the sentence

that the court -- that you're citing in the court's

2

decision is certainly subject to some scrutiny and

3

clarification, but that was not necessary to the Court's

4

decision here.
In normal cases, including Miller and Shaw, the

5
6

Court asks about the constitutionality of districting in a

7

context where districting is the normal procedure, and

8

there are normal districting principles -- the decennial

9

reapportionments, for instance.
In this case, the traditional districting

10
11

principle as far as dividing any judicial district in

12

California is, we don't do it.

13

QUESTION:

We do not do it.

Your position here, Mr. Stone, is

14

that you are satisfied with the November 1995

15

interlocutory injunction, and you ask that the district

16

court's judgment be affirmed?

17

MR. STONE:

Yes.

My point is that the

18

traditional districting principles, as that phrase is

19

normally used in decennial reapportionments, doesn't apply

20

here.

21

districts are designed for administrative convenience in

22

the justice courts, so the notion of it, maybe -- maybe in

23

a hearing they could prove that it was contiguous, so

24

what?

25

The districting principles that apply here --

It seems to me that affirmance is

inconsistent with your basic argument here, which is that
all the Court could do was order preclearance.

I mean,

how could we affirm?
The petitioners asked the court to do things
that it couldn't or shouldn't do, and the court went along
with it, and you want us to affirm it, and it looks to me
like to be consistent with your view we'd have to reverse,
or vacate and send it back and say the only thing on this
complaint you could do is order preclearance.
MR. STONE:

Except, Your Honor, that I think the

court's most recent order, the November order, was an
attempt to correct what it had unfortunately messed up
initially.
The court should not have issued the December
1994 order, which injected race, divided the county, it
gave 10 percent of the voters within a judicial district
the right and power to elect a judge that is sitting over
the whole district -QUESTION:

Well, if we should reverse the

November 1995 order, that wouldn't necessarily mean
approval of the December 1994 order, would it?
MR. STONE:

Well, but that would then be the

status quo, as the Court has used it.

That would be what

That's the trouble.
The court's effort was to correct that and bring

QUESTION:

3

I think that was

But you would be free to advance all

4

the arguments you've been making here, including the

5

unconstitutionality of that remedy, because those haven't

really been ruled on.

7

MR. STONE:

Is that not right?
Well, the court has not expressly

8

stated that it's remedy, its '94 remedy was

9

unconstitutional, but as I started to point out, the only

10

purpose for the dividing of this district was race.
QUESTION:

11

Yes, I know.

If that establishes

12

unconstitutional, it's an easy issue to decide.

13

he'll set aside the order if it's unconstitutional, but he

14

just hasn't so held, or they haven't so held -- there are

15

three judges -- I should say.

16

Surely

I think I'm right on that.

You still can make the argument.

You still may

17

win on this very ground, but that ruling has not yet been

18

made.
MR. STONE:

19

Well, and at this point it would be

20

moot, except for the extension of terms, because the court

21

was obviously uncomfortable with its remedy in the first

22

place.

QUESTION:

Well, if it would be moot, then your

answer -- then you're not standing by -- I think you're

not standing by the answer you gave a moment ago that if

all we do is conclude here that he should have enjoined

the use of the plan that he adopted, that that would

QUESTION:

I think you're now saying it wouldn't

All right.

No, it would, because the court has
But the court -Oh, because of the court's extension.

Well then, isn't Justice Stevens correct in

10

his suggestion that all you have to do, if the case goes

11

back in that posture, is to file an appropriate pleading

12

saying this status quo ante is unconstitutional, and you

13

should vacate any order of the court that establishes it?

14

You -- that's open to you, isn't it?

MR. STONE:

Well, when the Court held its

16

hearing on Miller, that was the question it wanted to

address --

QUESTION:

Yes, and that's the question -- and

that's the question that you can litigate if it goes back

in the posture that Justice Stevens and I are suggesting.

be something else in place of the system that's been found

2

retrogressive?

3

MR. STONE:

Well, the principal reason that you

4

know Miller should annul this interim remedy of December

5

'94 is the point made by Justice O'Connor that no

6

substantive harm to voting rights has been established, so

7

any remedy that brings race in at all, any remedy at all

8

is inappropriate in this Court.
QUESTION:

9

But suppose -- let's suppose the D.C.

10

Circuit finds you can't have this change because it's

11

retrogressive.

12

Circuit finds, how can you counter the retrogression --

13

retrogression necessarily involves race -- without saying,

14

I have to remedy that impact on race?

16

Then what?

MR. STONE:

If that's what the D.C.

That's what I don't

Well, that's -- it would be a very

different case if this were in the district court and if

18

retrogression, a substantive violation had been

determined.

Then the Court would have options.

QUESTION:

But we never even have empowered the

21

right decisionmaker, because it's been frozen in -- as I

understand it, in the district court within the Ninth

Circuit that doesn't have the authority to make that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOAQUIN G. AVILA

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

MR. AVILA:

I would like to refer the Court to

10

Conner v. Waller as providing authority for the issuance

11

of injunctive relief and additional relief beyond merely

12

the issuance of a permanent injunction.

13

I would also like to point out that at least in,

14

previously in this Court in Shaw the State is not entirely

15

covered under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and only

16

Federal counties, but yet when the State enacts a

17

redistricting plan that affects those counties, those

18

plans that directly affect those counties have to be

19

precleared.

2j

And with respect to the remedy we are urging

21

this Court to reverse the district court's use of the

22

unprecleared election change, and so that the court can

23

then conduct whatever evidentiary hearing needs to be

24

conducted in order to determine what should be the

25

appropriate remedy, and the reason why we have to go

beyond the injunction is because there has been --we have

2

to correct the previous effects of elections that were

3

conducted under an unprecleared election system, and that

was what the temporary plan did.

We have election systems since 1968, up to the

unprecleared election system.
