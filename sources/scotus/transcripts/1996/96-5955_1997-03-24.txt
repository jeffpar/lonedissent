ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KARPE:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please

the Court:

11

This case presents the issue of whether the

12

Fourth Amendment prohibits a blanket exception to the

13

knock-and-announce rule in drug-dealing cases.

room, wasn't he?
MR. KARPE:

Mr. Chief Justice,

I fully agree,

19

and as one who has been a resident of a hotel recently I

20

would submit that it is the longstanding doctrine of this

21

Court that a hotel room is a home for the purposes of the

22

Fourth Amendment under Stoner v. California --

QUESTION:

Is there a case that says a motel

room is a home?

U.S.

-- United States v. Jeffers, United States v.
QUESTION:

2

I agree with you those cases said

3

that a hotel room is protected by the Fourth Amendment.

4

don't know that any of them ever said a hotel room is a

5

home.

6

MR. KARPE:

I -- Mr. Chief Justice,

I believe

7

that those stand for the proposition that the hotel room

8

has the same protection as a home.

9

and a roof,

10

I

If it has four walls

it's a home.

QUESTION:

I think that's probably correct, but

11

to say -- when you say that a motel room -- we're talking

12

here about the sanctity of the home.

13

something that is protected under the Fourteenth Amendment

14

in the same way that a home is.

15

MR. KARPE:

16

QUESTION:

homes anyway,

You're talking about

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
The Fourth Amendment doesn't mention

does it?

MR. KARPE:

QUESTION:

It mentions -The right of people to be secure in

their persons, houses, papers, and effects,

the structure but rather what occurs inside the house.
The Bill of Rights was adopted in reaction to

2

3

the anti-Federalist concern that way too much Federal

4

power was going to exist and it was going to invade the

5

home and what it contained, the privacy of the -- your

6

family, your spouse, so I believe that the home is the

7

core value of the Fourth Amendment.
If the Fourth Amendment does not protect the

8

9

home, it doesn't protect anything.
Now, the judge who issued the search warrant in

10

11

this case weighed the sanctity of the home against the

12

general allegation by the police that drug dealers tend to

3

carry on, and the judge who issued the warrant found that

4

no-knock was not appropriate, specifically instructed the

5

police not to exercise no-knock, they chose to disregard

6

that when --

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Karpe, on that striking feature

8

of this case, here it was the affidavit of the police

9

with -- asking for permission for no-knock, and the United

20

States struck that out.

in affidavits, and how does it -- is it ordinarily taken

out?

MR. KARPE:

Is that a common thing to include

I have seen a number of different

24

forms of applications for search warrants, Justice

25

Ginsburg, and sometimes there's check-off boxes.

In this

1

particular case, the police made an application for a no­

2

knock and Judge Frankel, upon reviewing the facts that

3

were pled in the complaint for the search warrant, decided

4

that the circumstances did not merit -QUESTION:

5

What I'm asking, maybe you don't know

6

the answer to this question, is, is it standard operating

7

procedure in Wisconsin for the police to ask for no-knock

8

permission?
MR. KARPE:

9

Justice Ginsburg, I'm sorry, I

10

misunderstood your question.

11

the police seek advance approval of no-knock.

12

warrants are neither specifically forbidden nor

13

specifically --

15

QUESTION:

MR. KARPE:

No-knock

As a matter of practice, do police --

is this a common form of affidavit?

16
17

There's no requirement that

Do police ask for it?

Often they do that, Justice

Ginsburg.
QUESTION:

And is it also often that the judge

X's it out, the magistrate X's it out?

20

MR. KARPE:

I cannot speak to that, Justice --

21

QUESTION:

Would it be a fair interpretation to

22

say that the judge instructed the officers that they must

23

knock, and failure to do so was therefore a violation of

24

the warrant?

understanding your question correctly, but by -QUESTION:

2

3

By striking it out, does that mean

that they must knock?

4

MR. KARPE:

I believe that was Judge Frankel's

5

intention, that his review of the facts presented to him

6

did not present that it would be reasonable --

7

QUESTION:

Of course, that's not really in this

8

case.

9

by the Wisconsin court that did not depend on the

10

This case is here for us to test the rule announced

interpretation of the warrant.
QUESTION:

11

12

What would your position be if in

situations where the magistrate does authorize a no-knock

3

entry, do you say that if police then follow such an

4

authorization and enter without knocking, can we have a

5

blanket rule saying that if the magistrate has authorized

6

it it is going to be in compliance with the Fourth

7

Amendment ?

8
9

MR. KARPE:

Justice O'Connor, the way I

understand the question, I think that the pre-approval

20

would not necessarily make the search reasonable.

2

depends on the particular circumstances confronted by the

22

officer at the time of the entry.

23

QUESTION:

I take it the converse would be true.

The court might very well have said, you've got to knock,

but if they get to the porch and they hear guns being

fired inside, I take it it would be quite reasonable for

2

them to say, we're not going to knock, we're going to go

3

in like gang-busters, and you wouldn't have a

4

constitutional argument.

5

MR. KARPE:

6

QUESTION:

Granted, Justice -Or even if they don't hear guns being

7

fired, if they hear nothing but what the court expected

8

them to hear, the court might have just been wrong, isn't

9

that right, as to whether it would violate the

10

Constitution?
MR. KARPE:

11

Yes, Justice Scalia, which is why

12

it's so important that there not be a blanket exception

13

that basically removes the judicial process and has law

14

enforcement then acting in a way unfettered by legal

15

process.

QUESTION:

It basically makes the line officer the final

But, gee, that happens a lot of times

18

with searches and seizures.

19

exceptions to the warrant requirement are innumerable now,

20

and with respect to every one of those exception, exigent

circumstances and so forth, it's up to the police officer

22

to make his best judgment.

QUESTION:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. KARPE:

The -- this is -- in this area

I like that.

In this area, we would submit that a

17

blanket rule would never be acceptable with regard to

18

unannounced entries.

19

QUESTION:

The courts even found -We recently announced a blanket rule,

20

did we not, in, I believe it's Maryland v. Wilson, with

21

reference to people stepping out of automobiles.

22

this just as sensible?

MR. KARPE:

MR. KARPE:

Apart -- but that was a very de

2

minimis sort of intrusion.

3

This is not a de minimis intrusion.

4

QUESTION:

The car is stopped anyway.

Well, that could be major.

It could

5

be a storm, and it could be some poor woman nursing a tiny

6

baby, or some sick person.

7

MR. KARPE:

That's not a de minimis rule.

The Court had already ruled in

8

Pennsylvania v. Mimms that asking the driver to step out

9

under the same circumstances was de minimis.

10

11
12

I think that

Maryland v. Wilson was a fairly simple extension.
This is simply not de minimis by any means.
This is one of those extraordinary searches, extraordinary

3

invasion which is unusually dangerous and unusually

4

invasive of someone's privacy and their safety.

People get killed during these things.

1

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

I take it that -- right.

The police say -- I think they have a

4

legitimate interest in some -- with drug deals in general,

5

not announcing their presence, because a) they might get

6

killed, or b) the person might jump out the window, or

7

c) he might flush the drugs down the toilet.
They say that happens all the time -- all the

8

9

time.

As soon as they find out, police, it's into the

10

bathroom, the drugs are gone, and they want to preserve

11

the evidence, they don't want him to run away, and they

12

don't want to get shot, so what is the response to those

13

three?

14

MR. KARPE:

Justice Breyer, there is certainly

15

no indication that Mr. Richards was going to attempt to

16

destroy drugs, and certainly the way they were packaged he

17

would have had a heck of a time.

18

They were basically divided up into 120 little

19

plastic packets, plus * and to answer your question and at

20

the same time sort of get back to Justice O'Connor's

21

question, the mere fact that even if a drug dealer has

22

guns, it does not mean he intends to use them against the

23

police.

24

to enforce debts, to protect themselves against rivals,

25

and people certainly are afraid of being burglarized.

More than -- more often than not it's to get --

The most dangerous instances that we've come

1

2

across in terms of these sort of police invasions without

3

announcement is that people think they're being

4

burglarized and take weapons out, get ready to shoot, and

5

when they learn it's the police, then they drop the

6

weapons.

7

The instances where police tend to get shot is

8

not this myth that the Allegro article that's often

9

referred to speaks of, this fatal funnel where the drug

10

dealer stands at the door with his weapon pointed at the

11

door waiting for someone to come in.

12

More often than not, when an officer is killed

13

during one of these searches it's because there's someone

14

in a back room who's hiding, and --

15

QUESTION:

Once again, I'd rather be inclined to

16

rely on the judgment of the officers as to what is more or

17

less likely to endanger their lives.

18

give them a form of protection that they are too stupid to

19

give to themselves?

You're asking us to

9

nature of things, police officers won't do it.

10

That'll take care of itself.

MR. KARPE:

If, indeed, it's more

Justice Scalia, I don't think

11

there's any indication that in fact it is more dangerous

12

to the police to announce.

13

QUESTION:

That just is not there.

Well, the State says so.

I -- you

14

know, and I'm inclined to accept their judgment as to

15

what's more dangerous or less dangerous for the police.

16

MR. KARPE:

I -- in any case -- I don't -- this

17

is not really in response to your question, but in any

18

case, in the -- this Court's very well-reasoned and

19

unanimous decision in Wilson v. Arkansas, this Court

20

recognized the presumption in favor of announcement.

21

think that the blanket exception in fact ignores the

22

precepts of Wilson and sets a presumption against

23

announcement.

QUESTION:

2

sure, ordinarily you must knock and announce.

3

there are extraordinary circumstances where you don't have

one of those extraordinary circumstances.

Suppose we just had a rule,

It's not an absolute rule.

However,

Would that rule

It just says, you

Conceivably there's some situations in

which drug-dealing wouldn't allow you to go crashing in if

you know the drugs are being held in hundred-pound bales

11

by little old ladies without guns.

(Laughter.)
MR. KARPE:

Justice Scalia, again, that -- the

14

presumption there is going the wrong way.

saying there has to be announcement in every single case,

discussing the U.S.'s position --

the police would possibly have no motivation to uncover

like the two that are in the appendix to this amicus brief

2

from Americans for Effective Law Enforcement, that gives

3

the magistrate authority, if he finds two things, one that

4

there's a danger to life and limb, and that the -- or that

5

the property sought may be easily or quickly destroyed?

6

Is that statute, those two statutes

7

constitutional, where the magistrate relieves the officer

8

of the decision to be made on the spot by authorizing in

9

the warrant a no-knock search if these conditions -- if

10

the magistrate finds these conditions present, that the

MR. KARPE:

Justice Ginsburg, I think if there's

14

a specific indication that there is danger to the officer,

that would be acceptable.

applying the exigent circumstances doctrine, and if

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES E. DOYLE

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
GENERAL DOYLE:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

The Wisconsin supreme court has made a common

15

sense determination, in light of the modern-day drug

16

trade, that in the execution of search warrants for -- in

17

felony drug-dealing cases it is reasonable under Fourth

18

Amendment standards for the officers to knock, announce

19

their presence, and give the occupants an opportunity to

20

react.
There is discussion about what an invasive,

21

22

intrusive entry into the home this search is, and we

23

agree.

24

no-knock search and a knock search in a drug case, you

25

would be -- you would see almost exactly the same events

Whether there is a knock-and-announce or a no­

1

QUESTION:

Just enough time for somebody who

2

would hear the knock to come?

3

GENERAL DOYLE:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.

General Doyle, if you're correct that

5

the videotapes would show the same scenario regardless of

6

whether there's a knock or no-knock, doesn't that suggest

7

that the no-knock -- that the requirement of a knock

8

doesn't really harm the law enforcement operation?
GENERAL DOYLE:

9

It harms law enforcement

10

enormously, because in circumstances, and we would argue

11

in drug-dealing cases, because that knock and announce,

12

it's 10 to 15 seconds of waiting, and then it's however

13

long a time it takes to get organized then to come through

14

the door.

15

QUESTION:

Right.

16

GENERAL DOYLE:

And during that time a person on

17

the other side who is going to train a gun at that door

18

has full time to do it, or a person who is intent on

19

destroying narcotics may do it.
There's a suggestion in this case that there's

20
21

no evidence that anybody was going to destroy drugs.

22

Well, it's interesting, these drugs were stored in the

QUESTION:

Well, if you're going to rely on

destruction of evidence, would it not be true that in

every drug case there is a possibility that some of the

5

drugs will be flushed down the toilet --

6

GENERAL DOYLE:

7

QUESTION:

8

9

It is true --

-- and that therefore you don't

really have to rely on the violence at all.
GENERAL DOYLE:

It is true that in every drug

10

case there will be destruction, there is the potential of

11

destruction.

12

felony drug cases because of the convergence in a violent

13

and dangerous form of commerce of weapons and the

14

destruction of drugs.

15

The Wisconsin blanket rule applies only to

QUESTION:

My question really, General Doyle, is

16

if the potential for destruction of evidence is sufficient

17

by itself to justify no-knock, why shouldn't the rule

18

encompass even misdemeanor cases, because there always is

19

that potential there, it seems to me.

20

GENERAL DOYLE:

I think in most misdemeanor

21

cases, even on a case-by-case analysis with the police

22

officers going to the door in a drug case, that in that

23

case-by-case analysis -- there may be some exceptions to

it, but in that case-by-case analysis the balance would

weigh heavily on the side of the police.

QUESTION:

Would it ever weigh the other way if

information that it is only the grandmother who is on the

premises, perhaps.

QUESTION:

But she's fast enough to get to the

GENERAL DOYLE:

Well, she may be, but as I say,

11

in a case-by-case analysis with -- in a misdemeanor simple

12

possession of marijuana with a grandmother on the

13

premises, perhaps it is sufficient.

14

balance you would come out with a knock-and-announce, but

15

what we are advocating --

16

QUESTION:

Perhaps in that

I'm suggesting that you rule out --

17

you say you never need to knock-and-announce if

destruction of evidence is a sufficient exigent

19

circumstance.

21

me, that you get some drugs flushed down the toilet.

22

I don't know why you ever have to knock and

GENERAL DOYLE:

I believe you do not have to

3

GENERAL DOYLE:

Well, on the question of whether

4

it will be a formality, much depends on what position this

5

Court adopts in this case.

QUESTION:

7

GENERAL DOYLE:

If you were to --

Well, let's --- adopt the petitioner's

position it is much more than a formality.

QUESTION:

We'd have

Well, let's assume this Court says,

11

look, we are perfectly willing to recognize that in most

12

cases involving drug dealers the State will in fact have

13

valid grounds for dispensing with knock-and-announce,

14

because the marijuana won't be in the barn and the

15

informant will not have said, these people are unarmed.

16

So that we said, we recognize that in most cases

17

they'll be able to make their proof without great

18

difficulty, but we're not going to adopt a blanket rule

19

for the simple reason that if we do we're going to be

20

starting down the road to more blanket exceptions, and

21

more blanket exceptions after that.

22

So that in order to preserve the particularized

23

inquiry value, which is a real value in the long run,

24

we're still going to require the State in effect to make

25

its proof knowing perfectly well that the State can do it

m most cases.
Now, that, I take it, would be a fairly benign

2

3

atmosphere for you to present your proof in individual

4

cases.
Assuming we said something like that, are we

5
6

then in this case arguing about anything much more than a

7

formality?
GENERAL DOYLE:

8

9
10

Yes, I believe you are, Justice

Souter.
Let me say that the position you've laid out, as

11

I understand it, is essentially that of the Solicitor

12

General, and it's one that we would prevail on in this

13

case under the record and that we would accept, but I do

14

think that there are values and reasons to go beyond it

15

for the blanket rule, and there are two of them.

16

The first is that the officer at the scene, as

17

he or she approaches the door, or as they approach the

18

door in drug cases is -- will be, under the blanket rule,

19

able to make a strategic, tactical decision not worrying

20

about whether or not it will meet a reasonableness Fourth

21

Amendment test at a later time down the road.

22

And in that regard I think it is -- this case is

23

very much in line with Michigan v. Summers, in which in

24

the manner of the execution of the search warrant this

25

Court did adopt a bright line rule that permitted officers
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

1

to round up the people on the premises where a search

2

warrant was being executed.
And here we are talking, just as in Michigan v.

3
4

Summers, with the manner of the execution of the search

5

warrant, and I believe that police officers, for their

6

safety, for the safety of the occupants within, should be

7

able to make those decisions on the entry based on their

8

tactical and strategic decisions.
Now, they may decide for reasons that were

9
10

mentioned earlier by my opponent that in some of those

11

instances it may not be safe and wise to come barging in.

12

It may be safer for everyone to come in a different way,

13

but that decision is a strategic and tactical one.

14

The second issue is, I think that over time you

15

will see those relatively benign suppression hearings

16

become very complicated hearings about what additional

17

facts did the police know.

18

QUESTION:

Okay, you --

Well, wouldn't part of it be who had

19

the burden of proof in those hearings?

20

State had the burden of proof at the suppression that it

21

didn't know anything more, it's very hard to prove a

22

negative.

2

then we go through a hearing on what more did you know, if

3

we have to prove what we didn't know, it becomes almost an

4

impossibility.
I think you will also be led, Justice Souter,

5
6

into a series of hearings and a whole area of new issues

7

of law for you to be resolved about what further proof is

8

enough to overcome the drug-dealing exception.

questions that I have with respect to your argument about

exercise?

16

One is, what do we do about

Was that just an idle

And the second question is, in this very case

17

there was one justice on the Wisconsin supreme court who

18

said, I think that no-knock is generally required, but

19

it's obvious that in this case it could be dispensed with,

20

so it didn't seem like it's a very complicated exercise if

21

you apply the rule, and if you don't apply the rule,

22

aren't we just gutting what we said a couple of years ago?

23

GENERAL DOYLE:

Justice Ginsburg, I think Wilson

24

QUESTION:

And we said that in the case of a

4

drug offense in which the police were told that the person

5

they were going in to apprehend was armed.

6

GENERAL DOYLE:

That's correct, and you made it

7

clear in Wilson v. Arkansas that the facts, and whether

8

there -- whether it was justified to enter without a no­

9

knock, would be remanded to the Arkansas courts to be

10

determined, and this Court also made it clear in Wilson v.

11

Arkansas that it was -- you were going to leave it to the

12

State courts at least for a while to begin to determine

3

those times in which legitimate law enforcement concerns

4

outweighed the requirement of knock-and-announce.

5

As I read Wilson v. Arkansas, the Arkansas

6

supreme court just sort of put it to you pretty bluntly.

7

I mean, they said this doesn't have any Fourth Amendment

8

implications, and I think this Court said it does have

9

Fourth Amendment implications, and we are here agreeing,

20

and in fact the Wisconsin courts have always agreed it has

21

Fourth Amendment implications.

22

QUESTION:

But we review a judgment, not an

23

GENERAL DOYLE:

I think that, if I might say so,

3

you were correct at remanding to have the Arkansas court

system consider the facts of that case under the -- in

5

light of the determination that knock-and-announce is part

6

of the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment,

7

and you sent it back to a State court to make that

8

determination.

QUESTION:

We don't always determine alternative

10

grounds for affirmance on our own.

11

there's an alternative ground argued.

GENERAL DOYLE:

We often remand where
Isn't that right?

Well, that's correct, and again,

13

after Wilson v. Arkansas, as this Court made it very

14

clear, it said that failure to knock and announce might

15

violate the Fourth Amendment, and that you were going to

16

leave it to States.

17

QUESTION:

We -Then if we do that -- I mean, what

18

I'd be rather worried about here is, if a blanket rule

19

crime-by-crime is constitutional, Wilson v. Arkansas

20

doesn't mean too much, I would think, because after all,

21

most people who are arrested and searched have committed,

at least probable cause to believe they've committed

rather serious crimes.

GENERAL DOYLE:

GENERAL DOYLE:

What I am asking this Court to

7

do is to, as you did in Maryland v. Wilson, is to

8

determine reasonableness in a category of cases, and that

reasonable test --

10

QUESTION:

May I ask you -- may I ask you in

11

doing that if you have any statistical evidence that you

12

want to point out to us that demonstrates that it is more

13

dangerous to officers to knock and announce than not to?

14

Is there any place we could look for that?

15

GENERAL DOYLE:

Your Honor, the best that we can

16

do is what is in our brief, which shows that drug-dealing

17

is dangerous and it's dangerous to police, but frankly --

QUESTION:

true that there are at least some drug cases in which it's

5

telling us what percentage are the dangerous ones and what

6

GENERAL DOYLE:

Well, that's correct, Justice

8

Stevens, but also, on those kinds of hypotheticals there

9

are certainly facts presented in our brief, and I think to

10

the Court's common knowledge, that the fact that it's an

MR. ESTRADA:

A

12

fundamental point in this case, Justice Scalia, is that

13

all that is at issue in this case is what can be a basis

14

for a reasonable belief on the part of the officers that

15

they will be in danger, or that the drugs will be

based on past experience with similar cases is just as

valid a ground for a reasonable belief on the part of the

officer as may be the circumstances that confront the

20

officer at the specific time of the entry.

more is known, will ordinarily warrant the officer in

thinking that those dangers exist and to make an

MR. ESTRADA:

It may be the case that there are

other cases in which similar -- in which a similar rule is

warranted, Justice Ginsburg, but I think that the class of

You are suggesting a general

4

MR. ESTRADA:

Is that an appropriate

That is right, Justice Kennedy.

5

All we're saying is that the standard that is offered by

6

Mr. Karpe is so low that in the absence of any further

information the officer's knowledge that the case involves

8

drug-dealing will itself be a reasonable basis for a case-

specific reasonable belief that there is danger to the

officers.

may be okay, it is possible for a State or for the Federal

2

rules to have that sort of a mechanism.
My point is that it is not constitutionally

3
4

required, because in the Dalia case this Court confronted

5

that issue, whether the judge should authorize in advance

6

an unannounced entry, and the Court answered that issue in

7

the negative, so it may be a good -QUESTION:

9

Yes, but what about those States that

do, by statute, provide that the magistrate will consider

and determine whether or not there can be a no-knock

entry?

constitutional to have a per se rule?

Now, if that's the scheme, then is it

MR. ESTRADA:

It is -- it likely is, if the

warranted in the circumstances.

answer was in the negative.

magistrate makes the determination that you must knock,

directs the officer to knock as part of the warrant, and

judgment, and they don't knock, that does not necessarily

invalidate the search, does it?

MR. ESTRADA:

1

That is right, and let me take

2

that as an opportunity to answer something that Mr. Karpe

3

said.

4

When the warrant was sought in this case it was

5

in 1991, and at that time the State courts in this State

6

had a rule that a mere showing that the case involves

7

drug-dealing and an assertion that those cases are likely

8

to be categorically dangerous was insufficient to

9

authorize a judge to issue a no-knock warrant, so all that

10

the judge in this case did was to say that the facts that

11

are in this case had no bearing on whether a -- whether

12

the officers should make a no-knock entry.
It is not that the judge made a determination

13
14

under the right Fourth Amendment standard that the

15

circumstances in this case did not justify a no-knock

16

entry.

17

Further -QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, what do you do about

18

General Doyle's concern that it's fine to have this

19

general rule, but it will always be controverted at the

20

21

say, well, you knew that we didn't have -- you knew that

22

we didn't have weapons.

23

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I think that in our view

24

someone would not be entitled to a hearing unless he can

25

point to objectively ascertainable facts that indicate

that prima facie at least the conduct was clearly

2

unreasonable.

3

In the Federal system there are very few

4

suppression hearings held, because unless someone is able

5

to come forth with a prima facie showing that there is, in

6

fact, a Fourth Amendment violation, one is not entitled to

7

have a hearing so that one may inquire.

8

QUESTION:

9

that we didn't have weapons?

10

Well, what does that require to show,

weapons.

11

MR. ESTRADA:

12

QUESTION:

13

In fact, we didn't have

Well --

And I say, you knew it.

Is that

enough to get a hearing?

14

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, you would have to have a

15

specific factual basis for the imputation that they knew

16

it, and in the absence of that, no hearing would be

required.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ESTRADA:

On whom is the burden of proof?
In a search that is conducted

20

under a search warrant, Mr. Chief Justice, the burden

21

would be on the defendant.

the absence of such a warrant, it would be on the

that, that this was a financial crimes case, and they came

Certainly we have to

Mr. Karpe, suppose we were to take

21

Wisconsin's fallback position that not in every drug case,
