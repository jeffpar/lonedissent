ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. TIM DELANEY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DELANEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Congress enacted title IV-D pursuant to its

12

Spending Clause powers.

13

Congress had to unambiguously notify the States of any

14

consequences of their accepting Federal funds so that the

15

States could make an informed choice about whether to

16

participate in that program, and under this Court's

17

decisions in Suter, Congress could provide that notice to

18

the States by unambiguously conferring rights in title IV-

19

D that would be privately enforceable.

20

That meant, under Pennhurst, that

Here, Congress has neither unambiguously

21

conferred any rights upon respondents, nor unambiguously

22

notified the States that title IV-D can be enforced

23

privately by over 18 million title IV-D applicants.

24

Indeed, title IV-D says just the opposite, because when

25

Congress offered the title IV-D partnership agreement to

1

the States, it unambiguously deposited all enforcement

2

authority in the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
Congress told the States unambiguously that the

3
4

Secretary would enforce title IV-D, that the Secretary

5

would apply a substantial compliance standard on a

6

systemwide basis rather than an individual case-by-case

7

basis.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, what was sought here in the

complaint was something based on the substantial

10

compliance requirement, was it not, in the complaint?

11

This was a broad complaint.

12

MR. DELANEY:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

There are, however, some provisions

14

in the statute here that are very specific.

15

provisions that for, if the State is going to collect

16

money for non-AFDC parents, that it will pay the money

17

over to those parents very specifically and within certain

18

time limits.

19

For instance,

Now, that's a pretty specific requirement, is it

20

not?

21

collected money under that provision would have a right to

22

ask the State to pay it over if it were withheld?

23

Do you say that no parent for whom the State has

MR. DELANEY:

Justice O'Connor, that is an

24

important difference here in this case, and that is, once

25

the State actually receives the money, then the

1

individuals would have a right, a property interest in

2

getting that money if the State is wrongfully withholding

3

it, but that is not a statutory right.

4

a constitutional right in their property.

5

to move forward -QUESTION:

6

That then becomes
They don't need

Well, it might also be a statutory

7

right.

In any event, you would find at least some

8

provisions are specific enough that by some route they

9

could be enforced, would you not?
MR. DELANEY:

10

No, ma'am, not through the title

11

IV-D itself.

As we envision title IV-D, it's a funding

12

mechanism.

13

of domestic relations to the Federal Government in

14

exchange for the money, so it's a contract between the

15

sovereign interests, and what's happening here is we have

16

the Federal Government coming in and trying to run part of

17

the program.

The States gave up some of its rights in terms

QUESTION:

18

I would think some of the specific

19

provisions might well fall within cases that we have

20

decided previously giving individuals some rights, but

21

this complaint was not based on any such specific request,

22

was it?

23

MR. DELANEY:

24

QUESTION:

25

No.

This was a very broad --

Now, in Arizona's brief here you seem

to want us to address some other issues like the

overruling of Maine v. Thiboutot, and some Eleventh

2

Amendment arguments that were not raised in the cert

3

petition.

Is that correct?

4

MR. DELANEY:

5

QUESTION:

We have raised those --

Why should we get into those?

I

6

mean, you didn't come here with cert petition questions

7

identifying those.
MR. DELANEY:

8

9
10

We did not specifically, but we

think that they are subsumed within the question
presented, and -QUESTION:

11

Fairly subsumed, so that people all

12

around the country would understand you were going to be

13

here arguing the overruling of Maine v. Thiboutot.

14

MR. DELANEY:

Yes, ma'am, and indeed the

15

respondents, when they opposed our cert petition, said

16

that we were doing just that, and that our petition loudly

17

echoed that type of activity, and they have fully briefed

18

the case.

19

We think that this case presents an excellent

20

vehicle for the Court to reexamine Maine v. Thiboutot, but

21

we don't come here today saying that that's the only way

22

we can win.

23

the fact that title IV-D does not unamiguously notify the

24

States that there is any enforceable right in --

25

We can set that argument aside, and we win on

But Mr. Delaney, that hasn't been the

approach when 1 83 is there.

right to enforce laws of the United States, and in

4

connection with the question that Justice O'Connor asked

5

you,

6

suppose the State collected the money and simply didn't

turn it over.

claim?

This is a 1 83.

This is not a Cort v. Ash

Maine v. Thiboutot says there is a

I think you responded that there would be a claim --

You acknowledge there would be such a

MR. DELANEY:

We believe that there would be a

10

claim under either State law grounds or constitutional

11

grounds in the property interest.

12

QUESTION:

But what about a case where the

13

parent was located, the noncustodial parent, and had a

14

job, and the State simply refused to do anything about a

15

wage implementation order?

16

it be enforceable or not in Federal court?

17

MR. DELANEY:

Would that also -- well, would

No, ma'am, it would not be

18

enforceable under title IV-D, because title IV-D again is

1

a funding mechanism, and it's a funding relationship, and

20

in order for the court -- or in order for the parents to

21

come in and say that they have an enforceable right, we

22

need to make sure that they have one.

nothing, so that there's no claim possible under IV-D no

2

matter how specific?
MR. DELANEY:

And -- correct, and in terms of

3

the substantial compliance standard that Congress has laid

4

out in title IV-D, again that gets back to the funding

5

mechanism, when you have this funding relationship and

6

Congress says in order to continue getting funds you have

7

to perform at a substantial compliance standard on a

8

system-wide basis.

9

And it used to be when IV-D was first enacted

10

that it was full compliance in 1975, and it continued that

11

way until 1984, and Congress saw that no State had ever

12

been able to comply at a full compliance standard, so

13

Congress ratcheted it down from full compliance down to

14

substantial compliance, and in the process notified the

15

States that you didn't have to deliver service in each and

16

every case, and that's the way that the Secretary also

17

enforces it.

18

QUESTION:

Well, it notified the States that it

19

wouldn't take its enforcement measures such as reducing,

20

what is it, the IV-A money or whatever, as a result of

21

something less than a failure, or substantial compliance,

22

but it doesn't follow from that that there is no

23

individual right if in a particular case there is

24

individual crime.

25

MR. DELANEY:

Well, in fact we think that it

1

does follow that way, Your Honor, because Congress has

2

developed a very comprehensive scheme in title IV-D.

3

You mentioned the fact that we would be losing

4

title IV-A funds.

5

to have title IV-D operating full bore, at full speed,

6

doing all that it could for the masses that it was

7

designed to try to take care of, and in the process of

8

then pulling off on an individual case-by-case basis

9

various lawsuits we're -- again, we have over 18 million

The rationale there is Congress wanted

10

title IV-D applicants across the Nation, and it will

11

cripple the program if you allow these individuals to then

12

come in and try to enforce this on a case-by-case basis.

13

QUESTION:

I thought your point is it wasn't the

14

deal, that the States when they went in thought that all

15

they had to do was make a good faith effort and achieve

16

substantial compliance.

17

MR. DELANEY:

18

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

It was --

And if they have to achieve total

19

compliance, at least insofar as being liable to individual

20

suits is concerned, it's quite a different program they're

21

buying.

22

MR. DELANEY:

It would radically change, Your

23

Honor -- just as you are suggesting it was radically

24

change the agreement that we had entered into with the

25

Federal Government.

1

The Federal Government came in and told us again

2

that we would have to comply on a substantial compliance

3

standard on a system-wide basis, that if we didn't we

4

would have liquidated damages in the form of specific

5

liquidated penalties against us, but again they would be

6

assessed against title IV-A as opposed to title IV-D.

7

We were told that the Secretary would then have

8

the discretion to waive those liquidated damages when

9

appropriate, and we could then go in and negotiate with

10

the Secretary.

11

us to go in and in essence say, this isn't the time to be

12

enforcing the terms this rigorously.

13

There were other mechanisms available for

But again, we were told that we had an

14

agreement, and it was given to us in very unambiguous

15

terms exactly how it would be enforced.

18

QUESTION:

Well, the Federal Government has not

yet suspended Arizona from the benefits.
MR. DELANEY:

Your Honor, in fact the Secretary

19

has found that Arizona is in substantial compliance.

20

1984 she came out --

QUESTION:

In

That's a surprising finding, in light

22

of Arizona's recalcitrance in carrying out its program and

23

its apparent inability to handle these matters.

24

it has been a dismal sort of a performance there in

25

Arizona, but nonetheless, the Federal Government has not

I mean,

withdrawn the funding.

2

MR. DELANEY:

Correct.

Arizona has not had

3

anything withheld beyond the -- it was almost $1 million.

4

We did have that penalty assessed against us in the early

5

nineties.

QUESTION:

6

9

In terms -Has the Federal Government -- excuse

me.
MR. DELANEY:

In terms of Justice O'Connor's

statement Arizona has done an abysmal job, as the

10

complaint lays out, in 1988 Maricopa County, with no

11

notice to the State, bailed out of the title IV-D program,

12

and it dumped over two-thirds of all of the cases in title

13

IV-D upon the State.

14

try to start meeting those obligations.

15

The State then had to scramble to

And then in 1991 -- again, the Secretary then

16

came out and found that we were out of substantial

17

compliance, did the audit, and then was coming in annually

18

to do new audits to see where we were, did assess

19

penalties of almost a million dollars, and then found

20

under a subsequent audit than Arizona has now achieved

21

substantial compliance.

22

And, indeed, as we lay out in some of our

23

briefing materials, Arizona's now receiving national

24

awards, and it's the number one State in terms of

25

improvements for collections over the last 4 years, so

Arizona has turned things around and in large part because

2

of the comprehensive mechanism that Congress has laid out,

3

which is to get our attention,

4

million-dollar penalty assessed against us, but then to --

QUESTION:

6

in the district court action?

Did the Federal Government intervene

7

MR. DELANEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

and it did when we got that

No,

sir,

not in this case.

There was a letter that said in 1992

Arizona was found in substantial compliance.

Has there

10

been anything from the Federal Government since then

11

evaluating this program's compliance?

12

MR. DELANEY:

Your Honor,

that was actually a

13

letter in 1994 based on the latest audit,

14

in substantial compliance.

15
16

QUESTION:

19

But it was as of 1992, was it not,

or - -

17
18

that Arizona is

MR. DELANEY:
no,

It was based on a 1992 audit,

and

there is not a subsequent audit that has taken place.
QUESTION:

Do I assume correctly that you would

20

agree that if the agreement between the National

21

Government and the State of Arizona,

22

providing that Maine v. Thiboutot would be applicable in

23

the relationship between Arizona and the welfare

24

recipients,

25

unambiguous and they would have the private rights of

it had a clause in it

that then the agreement would be sufficiently

1

action to compel your enforcement, is that correct?
MR. DELANEY:

2

If it was that specific in the

3

statute, yes, but it is not in this particular statute,

4

and there are all sorts of mechanisms that I've already

5

identified showing that it is not.
QUESTION:

6

Do you also take the position that,

7

regardless of how clear the general law might be -- for

8

example, Maine v. Thiboutot law -- indicating that the

9

welfare recipients would have an action for enforcement,

10

that still there would be no action cognizable unless the

11

agreement between the Federal Government and the States

12

expressly referred to that unambiguous law?

13

MR. DELANEY:

We believe that that is what is

14

required under this Court's decisions in Suter, and in

15

Pennhurst, that in the Spending Clause context the States

16

have to be put on notice what the consequences of their

17

agreement or --

18

QUESTION:

Right, but the notice must be within

19

the four corners of the agreement.

20

notice by virtue of general but unambiguous law if it is

21

not specifically referred to in the agreement.

22

correct?

23

MR. DELANEY:

Yes, sir.

The notice cannot be

Is that

That is our position,

24

that it does need to be spelled out within the confines of

25

the funding mechanism statute so that the States are on

1

notice what it is that they're going to be exposed to.

2

And again, the problem that we face as States is

3

that there are two different lines of authority out there,

4

we have the Pennhurst-Suter line that talks in terms of

5

the Spending Clause and the fact that there are

6

significant federalism concerns here when you have

7

contracts between two different sovereigns, and then we

8

have the Wright-Wilder case, line of cases that suggest to

9

the contrary.

10

QUESTION:

But isn't -- I haven't looked at

11

Pennhurst recently, but wasn't it the problem in Pennhurst

12

that the State didn't know for sure what its obligation

13

was, not -- the question wasn't whether there was a remedy

14

if there were a clear obligation.

15
16

MR. DELANEY:

the States were not on notice what was required.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DELANEY:

QUESTION:

They -- the problem there was that

That's right.
Right.

But here you're on notice about

what's required.
MR. DELANEY:

No.

what the consequences are.
QUESTION:

We're not on notice about
We would put --

By that you mean you're not on notice

24

as to whether or not somebody can sue you if you fail to

25

do what's required.

1

MR. DELANEY:

Yes, sir, and we believe that is a

2

very significant difference, because if we're being told

3

that we're going to be penalized by the Secretary and the

4

Secretary alone, then we can deal with that, but to then

5

have 18 million different individuals who can then walk in

6

and demand enforcement is something completely different.

7

We were never told that they had enforceable rights.

8

QUESTION:

It seems to me that you're -- even

9

under your acknowledgement you're potentially liable to

10

18 million individuals if you don't give them the money

11

that's coming to them.

12

say they just have to sue not in Federal court but in

13

State court for their own property.

14

MR. DELANEY:

You've said that yourself, but you

If I did, Your Honor,

I misspoke.

These individuals do not have any enforceable rights.

contract is with the Federal Government.

flow to the Secretary.

QUESTION:

Our

Our obligations

I thought in answer to Justice

19

O'Connor you said that if money was owing to a particular

20

individual they could sue for it.

21

MR. DELANEY:

But that's different.

When

22

there's money that we have actually received from a third

23

party and we are holding that money, then --

24
25

QUESTION:

Aren't there 18 million people for

whom that could happen?

MR. DELANEY:

1

If we are able to collect, but

2

again, Nation-wide the collection rate is only 18 percent

3

because of the significant problems in child support

enforcement.
QUESTION:

5

What apart from -- let's leave aside

the question of the collection activity that we're talking

7

about.

8

under the prior AFDC scheme simply withheld a payment due?

9

Could the individual bring a claim for that payment?

10

What if the State of Arizona simply withheld,

MR. DELANEY:
title IV-D, no, sir.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DELANEY:

We don't believe they could under

How would they do it?
If Arizona withheld the -- if we

collected the moneys?
QUESTION:

No.

I don't know exactly what the

16

AFDC formula is, but whatever the AFDC formula is, if

17

there were a single parent with two children, and they

18

were entitled to X dollars a month, and the State did not

19

distribute the X dollars, could the parent and the

20

children bring a claim against the State for the money?

21
22

MR. DELANEY:

in title IV-D the difference is instead of having a direct

you were entitled to AFDC benefits and the State didn't

itself says that we will comply if we get anywhere between

45 and 90 percent establishment of paternity.

QUESTION:

We're being told -What about the payments?

What about

the -- perhaps the statute's changed so much that I don't

10

know which version I'm dealing with, and so I might just

11

be referring to an old statute, but this -- the words I

12

have in the red brief at the end seem to talk about IV-D.

3

And then there's something, 42 U.S.C. 64, that

4

says a State plan for child and spousal support must, on

5

page 9a it says, provide that amounts collected as support

6

shall be distributed as provided in section 657, and then

7

section 657, which wasn't actually in the brief, seems to

8

have, like, eight paragraphs which say rather specifically

9

who gets what money, and then it seems like 654(b) says

20

the State disbursement unit shall distribute all amounts

21

payable under 657(a) within 2 business days.

22

So it seemed like there was a lot of rather

23

specific requirements saying exactly how many dollars

different people would receive, some of them being AFDC

people and some of them being non-AFDC people, and I think

Justice O'Connor's original question, which I thought

2

Justice Stevens was getting at too, is doesn't at least

that part of the statute create a private right, or create

4

a 1983 action that would require the State to pay the

5

money, the specific dollars that it must pay to the people

6

who are entitled to those dollars?

7

MR. DELANEY:

Your Honor, if we have actually

8

received the moneys and we're holding the moneys and we

don't distribute, then yes, we could be sued if we're

10

wrongfully withholding it, but we could be sued not under

12

Well, I would be amazed if the

13

Constitution says you have to pay within 2 business days,

16

money you can deduct for expenses or not as this statute

19

least give that right, the right that the very specific

are you saying that this statute does not give that right

to a person who is entitled to those dollars?

QUESTION:

1

I'm not talking about substantial

3

that the statute does not give that right to those very

time periods, to the particular plaintiffs who are

entitled to those dollars?

7

MR. DELANEY:

My question is, is it your view

That was my question.

At first glance, yes.

However,

getting back to substantial compliance, the Secretary will

be promulgating regulations saying how she is going to

measure substantial compliance.

certain things.

13

There are other

The Secretary has promulgated regulations and

14

said that those time lines can be waived, those time lines

15

can be treated differently if you collect the moneys

16

within the audit period, and so the whole substantial

compliance thing does come back in in terms of measuring

18

whether there would be an individual right there or not,

19

and - QUESTION:

Could I follow up on that for a

minute?

compliance a defense to a Federal cause of action if it's

9

not a defense to a State cause of action?
MR. DELANEY:

10

The chief concern we have -- and

11

again, this whole line of questions has gone off on the

12

issue of actually holding the moneys, and we think that

13

that's a different situation because we actually have

property that we are holding of someone else's.

distinguishable from the broad range of the rest of title

That's

The complaint would not argue that

18

there's been a violation of any obligation under the act.

withheld.

MR. DELANEY:

19

much, frankly, as though the respondents were just asking

the Federal court to step into the shoes of the Secretary

at the Federal level and compel substantial compliance

22

with the act, just as the Secretary's obligation would be,

23

and to have the Federal court take over the entire

administration of this IV-D act, and I never read that act

as contemplating such a broad role for the Federal court.

Now, that's not to say there may not be certain

2

individual provisions in the act that are specific enough

3

that could require enforcement, as has been discussed

4

already, but the notion that the Federal court could be

5

asked to come in and just take over the whole idea of

6

whether there is substantial compliance in all its

7

details, supervise it, struck me as going beyond any case

8

that this case had ever handed down.

9

MS. BERZON:

At this juncture the issue in this

10

case, as I understand it, is simply whether there are any

11

enforceable rights of the particular kinds that are

12

alleged here, and I commend again section 143, which

13

really spells out what they are under 1983.

available I think is really quite a separate question.

QUESTION:

Ms. Berzon, I'm happy to talk about

16

the individual rights rather than the whole program.

17

Suppose you have a Federal statute that, let's say,

18

provides for broadcast licenses, and the claim is that the

19

license has been improperly denied.

20

The personsuing under 1983, however, is not the

21

person who would have gotten the license, but rather a hot

22

dog stand across the street from the person who would have

23

gotten the license, who claims that he lost a lot of

would have been a lot more traffic and so forth.

Title IV-A is

It is in that section and that sect:on alone

6

that the substantial compliance language appears, and it

7

appears in order to delineate a special draconian penalty

8

which says that if there is really, really noncompliance

9

with the statute, not only is the money that's being spent

10

for IV-D at issue, but other money, separate money, money

11

that is not being spent for this program but for a

different one is going to be docked as well.

not with everything in the world but with IV-D?

this, that it was not universal in any event.

It was only

substantial compliance earlier.
There is no determination at all that at this

3

moment Arizona is in substantial compliance and, indeed,

4

despite the representations that were made earlier,

5

Arizona is dead last among the States with respect to the

6

efficiency of their collections.

QUESTION:

I don't unfortunately have that

particular brief with me, but I'm fairly certain that

there was a broad statement that Arizona --we are pleased

10

to tell you that Arizona is in substantial compliance with

11

the program.

12

MS. BERZON:

But in any event, what I was going

13

to go on to say is that the statute as read against Bell

14

v. New Jersey, which has very similar provisions with

15

regard to funding, would permit the Secretary to, for

16

example, recoup misspent money and the regulations -- with

17

regard to IV-D money now, on a full compliance level.

18

And this Court in Bennett v. Kentucky Department

19

of Education specifically rejected a very similar argument

20

that would have read substantial compliance in a penalty

21

provision into the liability or obligations of the statute

22

as a whole, and it rejected that and said it isn't true.

23

It only applies to the particular penalties as to which

the substantial compliance language appears, and it does

not delineate the obligation when the obligation itself is

QUESTION:

Why do you think that's more

8

draconian than the relief you ask for in this complaint?

9

I mean, I'm not -- if I were the State administrator I'm

10

not sure that the cutting -- that the monetary penalty

11

from the Federal Government, or the cutting off of Federal

12

Government funds, would be any worse than being subjected

13

to a suit that demands, in effect, every individual get

14

what the act requires.

15

MS. BERZON:

Again, I would like to suggest that

16

the case at this juncture is not about relief.

17

whether there is a cause of action under 1983.

QUESTION:

It's about

I understand that, but I'm just

19

questioning your assertion that the substantial compliance

21

to me that to insist that the State comply with every jot

and tiddle of this law with respect to every person who is

24

itself pretty draconian.

provisions here do, and I'd like to say -QUESTION:

How could I find out which provisions
My particular problem is, suppose I

10

thought that some of these provisions -- I take it in 654,

11

where there are 24 listed obligations, suppose I thought

12

that some of them Congress did mean to be mandatory in the

13

sense that they might fall within 1983, but others of them

14

Congress didn't.

What should I do here?

It doesn't seem to me that the parties have

MS. BERZON:

It didn't cite

QUESTION:

So which -- where do I find out which

provisions of the statute you're talking about?
MS. BERZON:

6

Primarily the provisions of the

7

statute that we're talking about are the ones that derive

8

from 654(4), which is the provision that says that each

9

child is to be provided services with regard to location,

10

paternity, establishment of child support orders,

11

modification, and collection, and then there are various

12

provisions in this statute and in the regulations that

13

spin out exactly what that means, as well as provisions in

14

the statute which spell out the fact that the regulations

15

are binding on the States, and that the Secretary is to

16

issue these very specific timing regulations, which he did

17

do.

18

So I would suggest that what we need to focus on

19

here is the substance of the complaint, and that the

20

relief prayed for is really quite beside the point at this

21

juncture.

22

QUESTION:

Well, can you give us at least an

23

example of, if you're right that there is a claim that

there is a private right, of relief that would be beyond

That's the

Then how does a judge -As to the particular -- I mean,

You said, Ms. Berzon, as the statute

9

The State says -- what it says is, if you agree

MS. BERZON:

7

Technically the statute here doesn't require

The State has agreed, so the issue is

whether the State's breaking its word with the Federal

10

Government gives the right to people who are not parties

11

to that contract to come in and complain about it.
MS. BERZON:

12

Once again, this Court, starting

13

with Rosado v. Wyman, has dealt with this problem and in

14

Rosado and a series of later cases has suggested the

15

nature of relief which might be available here would be

16

conditioned on the State continuing to take the money.

17

the State at any point decided to opt out the money the

requirements would no longer apply.

1

QUESTION:

Isn't -- you spoke of general

2

equitable principles of relief applying, and I guess it's

3

not clear to me that they necessarily would, at least I

4

think in the way you intended, because in the usual class

5

action case I think the assumption that we make going into

6

court is that there is no one in effect who is going to

7

act on behalf of the class except these particular

8

plaintiffs who are suing on behalf of the class.

9

But that's not so in a case like this, because

10

here we have a Federal agency which presumably is in

11

business to do precisely what the class relief is

12

requesting, and that is to look at the big picture and to

13

sort of take the mega enforcement action, so I would have

14

thought that even on general equitable principles the only

15

relief that it would be appropriate for a court to decree

16

as opposed to leaving it to the National Government to

17

demand would be the specific relief of those who claim

18

that they have a particular entitlement quite apart from

19

whatever in the main the State's failure or success may

20

be, which is the business of the National Government.

21

MS. BERZON:

Again, this Court's cases have

22

never drawn that distinction.

Many of the cases --

Why shouldn't we draw the

QUESTION:

2

Why shouldn't we draw the

distinction?

In other words, why should a court in effect

4

take over an obligation which has been pretty clearly

5

delineated to be that of the Secretary here, as opposed to

6

doing what courts usually do in nonclass action cases

7

where there's nobody to act on behalf of a class if the

8

court and the plaintiffs don't, and that is simply to

9

provide the specific -MS. BERZON:

10

I guess because it would be

11

difficult to find -- certainly it would be difficult to

12

find any exception in 1983 which would preclude --

13

QUESTION:

Well, 1983 doesn't say anything one

14

way or the other.

1983 provides in effect jurisdiction to

15

provide equitable relief, and the question that I'm

16

raising is really one of equitable relief principles and

17

that is, when you have somebody who in effect can do the

18

work of the class action, i.e., the Secretary, why should

19

a court do anything other than do the work that the

20

Secretary cannot do well?
MS. BERZON:

21

I guess because the individuals in

question who are class representatives, if they can prove

23

a classwide relief, are simply doing what a class action

24

proposes.

As

a second tier we also think that our audit and penalty

be a second problem beyond that, and there's nothing in

So your answer is that there would

Welfare but there would be no standing against the

Secretary?
MS. MILLETT:

Right, because the person that --

of these are enforceable and others are not.

18

wanted to find out which one they're talking about, and

19

they say they're talking about 654(4) primarily, and if I

look at that, that provision says that the State has to

promise it will undertake to establish the paternity of

That's why I

It seems to

So now -- I'm

sure that's what they'll say.

that leads you to think that those words that I just quote

I think it's those words in

MR. DELANEY:

Ms. Berzon was talking about

looking at the substance of the complaint.

19

paragraph 132(t), they complain about the extraordinary

20

staff personnel shortages as the paramount cause of

21

noncompliance with IV-D requirements.

22

If you look at

Then at 133, paragraph 133, they complain that

Linda Blessing lacks the authority to direct the legal

work of the AG's office, and at 134 they complain about

problems with clerks in the Superior Court.
What they're asking for here is not a structural

injunction.

4

because they want a Federal judge to come in and tell

5

Arizona how to redo its State government activities, and

6

as the SG's representative just said, you need to sue the

7

person who can grant the relief.
Linda Blessing cannot redo what the Arizona

legislature's budgetary concerns are.

Linda Blessing

10

cannot go out and reconfigure the lines of Arizona State

11

government so that she can control the AG's office, and

12

she cannot go out and rewrite Arizona government in terms

13

of having to make the counties comply.

14

So it really boils down to, what's a Federal

15

court going to do here?

16

Secretary's done, or will it be imposing new duties beyond

17

whatever the Congress has passed?

22

We have to guess and hope that we come up with the answer.

We believe that the Constitution says otherwise.

requires that it be spelled out by Congress and not by

7

look at 644(4) and look at all the regs, I'll discover

8

it's very, very specific, and if it is?
MR. DELANEY:

9

Again, we think that that should

10

be something that they do across the street rather than

11

out at the various district courts or even at State courts

12

to be guessing, well, this one looks like it is, and this

13

one looks like it isn't.

14

uniform system we're going to wind up with a judge in

Phoenix looking at something different than one in

not enforceable.

Instead of having a Nation-wide

Congress should be doing that.
