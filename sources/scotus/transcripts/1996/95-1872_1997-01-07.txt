ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELODY L. McCOY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MS. McCOY:

11
12

The Court remains in session.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

13

This case is about whether an Indian tribe has

14

jurisdiction over a tort action between two non-Indians.

15

A-l Contractors was working on the Fort Berthold Indian

16

Reservation for the tribe's company.

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. McCOY:

19
20
21

Where is the reservation, Ms. McCoy?
The reservation is within the State

of North Dakota.
QUESTION:

And the accident occurred on a State

highway on the reservation?

22

MS. McCOY:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And what entity sets the speed limits

24

and the regulations for driving on that State highway?

25

it the State of North Dakota?

Is

MS. McCOY:

1
2

Yes, Your Honor, it is the State

that sets the speed limit.
QUESTION:

3

And the other rules applicable to

4

driving on that State highway?

5

MS. McCOY:

6

Those are set by both the tribe and

the State.

7

QUESTION:

They have different regulations.

8

State could say, no left turn without a stop, and the

9

tribe could say something the opposite?

10

QUESTION:

No right turn.

11

QUESTION:

No right turn, or whatever it is.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MS. McCOY:

At this time, Your Honor, there's

14

never been a case that's answered any kind of conflict

15

between the regulatory jurisdiction.

16

QUESTION:

The

But the State purports to adopt rules

17

and regulations and standards for driving on that State

18

highway.

19

MS. McCOY:

That's correct, as does the tribe.

20

QUESTION:

And could a State police officer be

21

there and issue citations for a violation?

22

MS. McCOY:

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. McCOY:

25

That's correct, yes.
Of the State law?

police.
QUESTION:

And in fact, who does police that

stretch of road?
MS. McCOY:

Primarily the Bureau of Indian

5

Affairs and the tribe.

6

stretch of road is a very small spur of a State highway.

7

It's not a major thoroughfare.

8
9

QUESTION:

There are also -- this particular

Right.

On all of the roads --

Well,

if a criminal traffic

citation were issued by a BIA staff person or a tribal

10

policeman, would the subsequent prosecution be conducted

11

in tribal court?

12

MS. McCOY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. McCOY:

15

QUESTION:

16

MS. McCOY:

Not if the person is a non-Indian.
Right.

That would go to State court.

That's correct.
Because it's a criminal procedure.
That's correct.

However, non-

17

Indians do answer to civil traffic offenses to the tribe,

18

even when they're cited by non-tribal or non-Federal law

19

enforcement --

20

QUESTION:

21

MS. McCOY:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

What's a civil traffic offense?
Speeding, open container -Those aren't punishable by fine or

imprisonment?
MS. McCOY:

Those are punishable by fine.

are civil offenses, civil traffic offenses, that's

They

1

correct.

That's correct, and I think that -- the accident

2

in this case occurred on the State highway, but the State

3

highway is a very recent easement, a 1970 easement by the

4

Federal Government.

5

QUESTION:

One other preliminary question.

Is

6

the highway marked so that it says you are now entering or

7

now leaving the reservation?
MS. McCOY:

8

9

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

There

are -- there's a sign at the very entry to the

10

reservation.

It only runs into the reservation for about

11

7 miles, but there's a sign, both the State speed limit

12

sign and the sign that you are entering the Fort Berthold

13

Indian Reservation.

14

QUESTION:

But the suit filed here is not a

15

traffic enforcement suit of any kind.

16

two nontribal members.

17

MS. McCOY:

18

QUESTION:

19

It's a suit between

That's correct.
And could the suit have been brought

in State court, do you suppose?
MS. McCOY:

20

There's not a definitive answer from

21

this Court as to that question, but we would concede that

22

yes - -

23
24
25

QUESTION:

You would concede that it could have

been.
MS. McCOY:

That's correct, concurrent.

What

1

we're asking is the Court also recognize --

2

QUESTION:

Has this Court ever recognized

3

concurrent jurisdiction in a civil context over a suit

4

that occurs on a State highway?

5

that, do you think?

6

MS. McCOY::

7

QUESTION:

8

No,

Have we ever dealt with

the Court has not.

Have we ever dealt with concurrent

jurisdiction with tribal courts at all?

9

MS. McCOY:

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. McCOY:

Yes.
In the State tribal context?
Yes, Your Honor.

That's the Three

12

Affiliated Tribes v. Wold decision of 1986, where the

13

civil cause of action arose on the reservation,

reservation,

15

16

in the State courts on the theory of concurrent

17

jurisdiction.

But the plaintiff there was the tribe

itself?

MS. McCOY:

QUESTION:

MS. McCOY:

That's correct,

and here --

Not a private nonmember?
That's correct.

That's correct.

23

Here -- here the plaintiff in tribal court is an elderly

24

woman who was married to a tribal member,

going towards the home on the trust allotment there that

and she was

this highway runs over.
QUESTION:

2

How could that make a difference?

3

She either is a tribal member or she's not, and she's not.

4

You concede that.

5

MS. McCOY:

That's correct.

I think, though,

6

there's two answers to your question.

It doesn't make a

7

difference under our primary theory, which is that Indian

8

tribes have jurisdiction over the conduct of non-Indians,

9

including Mrs. Fredericks and A-l Contractors, when the

10

case arises on Indian land, and on our alternative theory

11

it's not relevant either, because our alternative theory

12

is that --

13

QUESTION:

Is the State highway easement

14

considered Indian land?'

15

trust land probably held for the Indian tribe.

16
17

18

MS. McCOY:

The underlying fee surely is

That's correct.

It is our position

that this highway constitutes Indian land sufficient -QUESTION:

But, indeed, the easement itself is

19

held by the State and could be considered, I guess, State

20

land for that purpose -- the easement, State property?

21
22

23

MS. McCOY:

It's a State easement, a much lesser

interest than a fee simple.
QUESTION:

It's division of a bundle of rights,

24

basically, the easement giving the right to use and the

25

underlying fee being the rest, I suppose.

MS. McCOY:

That's correct, and it's clear that

this highway crosses exclusively Indian trust land for all

of 6-1/2 miles on the reservation.

There's a lake,

Sakakawea.
QUESTION:

Well, did -- where does the highway

resort?

Is it a -- because -- is the lake a

I mean, why does the highway go to the lake, or

don't you know?
MS. McCOY:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

On the Fort

12

Berthold Indian Reservation, this road was originally --

13

this is not in the record, but it was originally a Bureau

14

of Indian Affairs gravel service road that ran to the

15

original capital, or headquarters of this tribe's

16

reservation.

17

according to Corps of Engineer maps, since the 1940's.

18

That road has been there since at least,

Below the boundaries of the reservation it

19

was -- it has been a State highway.

20

the Garrison Dam was built and the lake was flooded onto

21

the reservation, the tribe's capital was flooded, and that

22

was subsequently moved.

23

a gravel BIA service road, only it stopped at the lake

because the lake came to meet the road.

The only things in Twin Buttes, population 300, are a K

QUESTION:

This is

Those are on other

Is there a marina of some sorts at

Twin Buttes, or -MS. McCOY:

It's my understanding there are two

13

dock sites, one at Red Buttes and one at -- they're --

14

Twin Buttes itself is about 3 miles below the lake on the

15

highway, and the two docks, they're not really full-blown

16

marinas, are to the left and right of that -- you know,

17

the east and west of that on the lake.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

But -- and one gets access to those

docks, as you refer to them, by the highway?
MS. McCOY:

That's correct, but the highway is

21

also used, you know -- that's seasonal use.

22

fact regulates seasonal vehicle use on that stretch of the

23

highway, but there are many other roads on the Fort

24

Berthold Reservation that provide the major access for

25

recreation and use of this lake.

Indian suing an Indian you have to go to tribal court, and

says if you're an Indian you can sue a non-Indian in

tribal court.

QUESTION:

Isn't there, Ms. McCoy, some dispute

QUESTION:

4

No, I don't think there's any

Is it not so that subsequent cases of

this Court have said that about Iowa Mutual?

5

MS. McCOY:

I believe that the reference there

6

was in the plurality opinion in the Brendale case, a 1989

7

case.

8

of the tribe's authority to regulate the private property

9

of non-Indians.

But that arose dealing with the issue in Brendale

That's not this case.

QUESTION:

10

But whatever Brendale involved, it

11

did distinguish Iowa Mutual on the basis that it was

12

merely an exhaustion, that there was no determination that

13

the tribe as opposed to the State had jurisdiction.

14

MS. McCOY:

And that, to the extent -- I

15

understand, Your Honor.

16

Brendale did hold that, that was not necessary to the

17

Brendale ruling and I think also the proper way to read

18

Iowa Mutual is that -- I realize it set the exhaustion

19

rule.

20

To the extent the plurality in

It also set the rule by which exhaustion would

21

be conducted, or else exhaustion itself would be a

22

meaningless exercise, because as this Court said in

23

National Farmers Union, where it expressly rejected the

24

argument that respondents make here now for a rule of

25

general and implicit divestiture of tribal court
13

1

jurisdiction over reservation-based civil actions, that

2

was unanimously rejected in National Farmers Union.

3

And 2 years later in Iowa Mutual, when it again

4

dealt with the issue of how to exhaust, Iowa Mutual set a

5

clear rule that tribal courts presumptively have

6

jurisdiction over reservation-based civil actions against

7

non-Indians, and the lower courts have relied on that -QUESTION:

8

That was dicta, though, was it not?

9

You didn't have to say that in order to decide the

0

question that the Court took the case to decide.
MS. McCOY:

12

I think that I -- with all due

respect, Your Honor, I -- Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

3

it was the rule of that case by which exhaustion was to be

4

conducted, because it gives guidance to the tribal courts

5

and the Federal courts on that very issue, and we don't

6

have Congress divesting this tribe's jurisdiction.

7

QUESTION:

There's a civil tort suit on fee

8

lands.

9

some lands to people who are not Indian member, tribe

I mean, you know, a tribe has some lands, it sells

20

members, and there's a slip-and-fall accident.

21

mean those court cases have to go to the tribal court?

22

mean, the State court couldn't handle an ordinary slip-

23

and-fall accident on a fee land?

1

jurisdiction, which is the issue here, and the scope of

2

the - -

3

QUESTION:

Well, that's what I wondered.

I

4

mean, I understand much better since your explanation why

5

the tribe really thinks of this, the highway, as really

6

its highway, and I can understand why they think that, but

7

I guess we have to decide this as if it were Interstate

8

93, or -- isn't that right? -- and the two people involved

9

had nothing to do with the tribe whatsoever, going down

10

the biggest State 10-lane highway in imagination, which

11

had -- just happened to cross the -- an Indian tribe's

12

land, and under an easement -- I mean, we'd have to decide

13

it on that basis, wouldn't we?

14

MS. McCOY:

Not necessarily.

We've offered the

15

Court three alternative theories for dealing with this.

16

The first one is, if you find the site of this accident is

17

Indian land, then this case is very easy to decide because

18

the tribes can regulate non-Indians, a fortiori, tort

19

cases, no problem in the courts.

20

The second theory, though, I think addresses

21

more of what you are saying, and that's if you don't want

22

to get into the status of the land issue, fee land here,

23

quasi fee land, trust land, then we offer the Court the

24

opportunity to apply the rule for Indian tribes that

25

governments can adjudicate tort cases arising within their

2

case arose within the reservation boundaries.

issue of off-reservation contacts.

If the status of the land is not necessary to a
determination of the --

QUESTION:

MS. McCOY:

8

QUESTION:

9

There's no

That's why my question --- adjudicatory jurisdiction -Is that clear, in an ordinary slip-

and-fall tort accident in the middle of a reservation, but

10

on fee land involving non-Indians, that those cases go as

11

a matter of course to tribal courts?
MS. McCOY:

12

It's not.

No case of this Court has

13

reached the issue of tribal adjudicatory jurisdiction on

14

fee lands.

15

Union both arose either on non-Indian-owned fee land or on

16

a Federal highway crossing Indian reservations, and the

17

Court did not rule against tribal jurisdiction.

18

However, Iowa Mutual and National Farmers

QUESTION:

Now, is your assertion that the

19

tribe -- you keep referring to adjudicatory jurisdiction.

20

As I recall, you say it is possible for the tribal court

21

to adjudicate the case but not to apply tribal law.

22

MS. McCOY:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
And you don't ask us to decide right

24

here whether they should apply tribal law or not, or do

25

you think they shouldn't?

your first question -- then there would be no

constitutional impediment to the exercise of tribal

MR. WARD:

The constitutional impediment would

12

be that this -- the Constitution recognizes two

sovereigns, the United States and the States.

-- somehow delegates this authority to the tribes, the

The controlling doctrine is the

whatever retained inherent sovereignty remained after the

this Court has recognized in Oliphant and Wheeler, for

MR. WARD:

2

Well, Your Honor, that would be a

3

difficult problem, because the Court's Santa Clara Pueblo

4

decision seemed to indicate that the -- the issues of the

5

Indian Civil Rights Act with respect to due process will

6

not be reviewed except in habeas corpus proceedings.

respect to review for nonmembers, the Santa Clara Pueblo

Ms. McCoy, I think, told us that, as a practical matter,

We've had cases decided on that very

MR. WARD:

Yes -- yes, you have, Your Honor.

17

And those cases involved reservations, where the tribe

retained its power to exclude, as opposed to where it had

19

given that up and agreed to give free passage, and agreed

20

to allow rights-of-way.

QUESTION:

And did it go along with this

easement that the tribe promised not to exclude anybody?
MR. WARD:

Yes, Your Honor.

The only rights

reserved to the tribe in the easement were the right to

Do you know of any case where a tribe

Your Honor, where the tribe has -QUESTION:

I'm not aware of any case from this

But do you know of any tribe that has

12

asserted exclusive jurisdiction as distinguished from

13

concurrent jurisdiction, where the plaintiff chooses the

14

forum?

15

MR. WARD:

I believe that the tribes, maybe.

16

And I believe that the effect of what happens, pursuant to

17

the Petitioners'

18

Mutual -- is that State courts and Federal courts are

19

reluctant to proceed because the action has been started

20

in a tribal court.

the tribe asserts exclusive jurisdiction,

by the way that the procedure is followed once that

I don't know that the fact that the tribe gives

an easement to a State necessarily means that the tribe

thereby cedes all of its jurisdictional responsibility

over the -- over the land as to which the easement was

given.

Why do you assume that's the case?

11

MR. WARD:

Well --

12

QUESTION:

Is it clear that the tribe could not

13

regulate Indians on that -- on that easement, for example?
MR. WARD:

14

Well, the -- the reason I assume

15

that's the case is for reasons similar to the Bourland

16

decision of this Court, that, in that case, the tribe gave

17

up the authority over the taken area for the building of

the dam and for the recreational enjoyment of hunting and

over non-Indians in that area.

it did not; that it did not retain that regulatory

control.

So, I mean, your highway principle that Justice.

MR. WARD:

Well, Your Honor, this -- this Court

5

has never decided whether an easement or an alienation of

6

land would give up the authority over the tribal members.

7

I don't think it goes that far.

8

essence of the tribe's sovereignty is the tribe's right to

9

regulate the affairs of its members.

I think the tribe -- the

So, in that sense,

10

there may be concurrent jurisdiction of the tribe over its

members with respect to the highway.

QUESTION:

of the reservation?

14

MR. WARD:

But to members within the boundaries

Exactly, yes.

Until the -- once the

State highway goes beyond the borders of the reservation,

16

the tribe loses its authority even over its members.

QUESTION:

I take it the terms of the easement

in this case do not address these questions?

19

MR. WARD:

20

What this Court stated in the Montana decision

Not specifically; no, Your Honor.

21

22

QUESTION:

Well, is that really completely true?

23

Some have argued that one of the sources of tribal

24

jurisdiction over non-Indians is the power to exclude.

25

MR. WARD:

That's correct.

And the tribe has given up the power

to exclude non-Indians from this road.

MR. WARD:

Yes, they have, Your Honor.

So, arguably, they might have given

I would submit that that's true, Your

And from an economic standpoint, a decision that

Could you explain something to help

over someone erroneously -- there's no personal

jurisdiction -- that person doesn't run into Federal court

and get an injunction.

6

MR. WARD:

What was the theory on which you

The theory that we originally went

into Federal court was that we had exhausted our tribal

court remedies with respect to jurisdiction and that the

tribe did not have jurisdiction to involuntarily force

Mr. Stockert and A-l Contractors into one of its courts

until they try to levy on your assets or something.

7

MR. WARD:

Well, Your Honor, I believe the

Federal question is presented by the fact that there is a

There is a

deprivation of his right to have this case heard in a
