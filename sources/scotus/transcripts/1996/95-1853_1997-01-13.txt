ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BENNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

I am here this morning on behalf of the of the

12

President of the United States, who has asked this Court

13

to defer a private civil damage suit for money damages

14

against him until he leaves office.

15

QUESTION:

Is the request to totally dismiss the

16

suit or to permit delay of the trial and any court

QUESTION:

MR. BENNETT:

I want to delay that as well.

However -QUESTION:

7

8

You -- you want to delay that as

well?

6

Should that be a general rule if

preservation of evidence becomes crucial in a case?
MR. BENNETT:

As we discussed in the District

Court below,

13

and make use of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Justice O'Connor, we have agreed,

and the

that if there's a danger of the loss

that we would cooperate to preserve it

QUESTION:

14

Well, what if you wouldn't go up and

15

what if the District Court -- what if the court below

16

disagreed with you?

MR. BENNETT:

QUESTION:

We

That is correct, Your Honor.

Well,

that's --

I mean, what -- I'm trying to figure

out what the rule of law you're urging upon us here.

20

MR. BENNETT:

The rule of law that we are urging

21

upon you,

22

circumstances in a case,

23

States should not be subject to litigation,

24

trial or in discovery.

QUESTION:

2

Is that issue a Federal -- is it a

Federal -- suppose the suit were in State court, and the

4

State court decided that the testimony of someone who was

not the President is important to be preserved.

MR. BENNETT:

7
8

Yes,

Does that

it's a Federal question,

because -QUESTION:

9

So if that State court's jurisdiction

10

would be appealable here, or would the whole case be

11

removable to Federal court, or -MR. BENNETT:

2

Well,

I don't know how you would

3

move a case from State court unless there is diversity.

4

And that's why this Court must issue a constitutional

5

ruling in this case.

6

complaint, and other complaints, could be brought into any

7

State court in the country and command the President's

8

time.

20

QUESTION:

Because, otherwise, this -- this

But the constitutional ruling you're

asking of us is not that the suit cannot be brought.

21

MR. BENNETT:

Well, we're asking --

So you're saying that the suit can be

And presumably it can be brought in State court?
MR. BENNETT:

We are saying the suit against the

President of the United States can be brought.

Right.

Now, these -- these questions

6

of whether you have to preserve the witnesses' testimony

-- it's important to the case or not -- do they render the

8

case removable to Federal court?

9

MR. BENNETT:

10

Yes, Your Honor,

I believe that

they do.

11

QUESTION:

They do.

12

QUESTION:

And I take it, just fading memories

13

of witnesses, over a period of,

14

not be sufficient to invoke the exception provision that

15

you're talking about?

16

MR. BENNETT:

say, 4 or 5 years, would

I believe that's correct, Your

17

Honor, particularly in this case, where the plaintiff had

18

almost 20 months when Mr. Clinton was -- was the governor.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Bennett --

20

QUESTION:

And I take it that -- I take it that

21

since you say -- and I think you're correct that this must

22

be a privilege that's applicable in State courts,

23

otherwise it would be a loser and it wouldn't give the

24

protection you think the President needs -- I take it that

25

means you cannot rely on separation of powers as the

your argument; you have to rely on some other

constitutional doctrine?

due respect, Your Honor.

7

this litigation or other litigation like it to go forward,

8

any State judge in the country or any county court judge

9

in the country could command the President's time.

Because if this -- if this Court permits

QUESTION:

10

I think this is a separation of

Right.

But separation of powers

11

isn't a doctrine that we impose on the State.

12

of powers is designed to confine each branch of the

13

Federal Government to its appropriate constitutional

14

scope.

15

MR. BENNETT:

Separation

Well, but I -- I would find it

16

hard to believe that this Court would say that separation

17

of powers would apply in a Federal court proceeding, but

18

that any county or State judge could virtually destroy the

19

power of the President under the Constitution in his

20

Article II duties.

21

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I understand there's a

22

Federal interest.

23

is that the inherent nature of the President's office

24

requires that the States be constrained in this way.

25

that's not separation of powers.

But it seems to me what you're saying

But

QUESTION:

1

Then it's Federal sovereignty.

But

2

I -- I agree with the concerns expressed in the question

3

by Justice Kennedy that it's if it were a suit in State

court.

5

of separation of powers notion.

It is very difficult to shoehorn it into some kind

6

MR. BENNETT:

7

QUESTION:

I -- I understand.

The supremacy clause -- I don't know

8

whether that bears on it -- but certainly not separation

9

of powers.

10
11
12

MR. BENNETT:

I -- I understand that, Your

Honor, but -QUESTION:

Mr. Bennett, is there any experience

13

in States with the temporal immunity with respect to a

14

governor that you are asserting here with respect to the

15

chief officer --

16

MR. BENNETT:

17

QUESTION:

We have found none, Your Honor.

And is it necessary -- you said we

18

must decide this as a constitutional matter because of the

19

State court situation -- this could be dealt with in the

20

Federal courts as a matter of Federal common law.

21

that where the immunities come from of executive offices?

22

And who knows if it would come up in a State court.

23

State court might have such a similar -- recognize such a

24

similar immunity as a matter of their common law.

25

Isn't

A

So why must we now assume that the State courts

1

will not have such a -- such an immunity and reach out for

2

a constitutional question instead of saying here's a suit

3

in Federal court and we can deal with it as a matter of

4

Federal common law?

5

MR. BENNETT:

I'm not quite sure I understand

6

the question, Your Honor, but I think I do.

I am

7

certainly saying that this Court could decide this case

8

without deciding the constitutional issue.

9

this Court could say that when the District Court judge

I think that

10

stayed the trial, she had an inherent power, under the

11

Landis case -- the Supreme -- this Court's decision in

12

Landis -- to stay the trial.

13

have to get to the constitutional considerations.

14

QUESTION:

And I don't think you would

Well, I -- I find it difficult to

15

adopt such a Federal common law rule if it were -- if it

16

were so easily frustratable.

17

a Federal common law rule that you can interfere with the

18

President's duties by -- by subjecting him to civil suit

19

would be silly if any State could subject him to silly --

20

to civil suit.

21

me that this Federal common law rule you're asking me to

22

adopt is one that will have some effect?

23

no effect if the States can do the same thing?

24
25

I mean to say that there is

I mean, don't you have to -- have to tell

MR. BENNETT:

And it will have

Yes, I agree it would be very

silly for any county judge or any State judge to start

deciding on the priorities of the President of -- of the

2

United States.

3

QUESTION:

So I have to get to State courts

4

somehow.

5

that we can enforce upon State courts as well as Federal.

6

Any general rule we adopt surely has to be one

MR. BENNETT:

Oh, that's of most importance to

7

this Court, particularly since the fact that you now have

8

long-arm statutes which were not common in the days of our

9

founders, and you could drag the President into any court.

10

You know, what's unprecedented here -- what is

11

unprecedented here is the notion of taking the President

12

of the United States of America, in whom the full

13

executive power resides, and subjecting that President to

14

any State court or any local court in the country.

15

Is this Court --

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Or even worse, any Federal court.

Because there you have, in addition, separation of powers.
MR. BENNETT:

Or any -- or in any Federal court.

19

And I think, interestingly, Your Honors, if you -- if you

20

just transpose the facts of this case to the Federal

21

system -- let's say that Miss Jones were a Federal

22

employee and let's say that Mr. Clinton were the

23

President, and let's say that instead of State troopers,

24

we're talking about Secret Service people -- it would be

Fitzgerald case, which -- which gave the President

2

absolute immunity for -- for acts within the outer

3

perimeters, would probably -- would probably prevent this

4

case from -- from going forward.

5

QUESTION:

Well, the record in Fitzgerald was

6

based on a fear that unless you gave the President

7

absolute immunity, as I understand the opinion, you -- you

8

-- he would not vigorously exercise his official powers as

9

President.

I don't see how that element is involved here.
MR. BENNETT:

10

I agree with you, Mr. Justice --

11

Mr. Chief Justice, that -- that element is not present

12

here.

13

with Justice Powell, the rationale for that decision goes

14

way beyond the chilling effect.

15

intrusion on the President's time.

16

But in the Fitzgerald opinion, in which you joined

QUESTION:

You talked about

But, Mr. Bennett, that sentence that

17

you feature was followed up by -- by these words,

the case of prosecutors and judges."

19

course of their office.

MR. BENNETT:

No.

No, Justice Ginsburg.

But --

23

but you went much further.

24

But you went much further in the Fitzgerald case.

This

was the core of the dissent of Mr. Justice White.

He said

I don't mean you personally.

that you are not giving absolute immunity simply to core

4

You are giving absolute immunity to the outer

QUESTION:

But I think we're mixing up two

5

things.

We're mixing up, one, the total immunity, because

6

you want the decisionmaking to be unfettered, and then the

7

immunity that's, as you say, temporary, temporal, just not

8

whether but when.

MR. BENNETT:
QUESTION:

10
11

Right.

We're not asking for --

And there are different

considerations involved in the two, are there not?
MR. BENNETT:

12

Yes.

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That

13

-- that is correct.

14

fundamental difference between the Fitzgerald case -- or

15

one of the fundamental differences is this Court

you request; isn't that right?

2

MR. BENNETT:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Right.

Now, how does that take you

4

from interference with the President himself, as -- as a

5

deponent or as a witness or simply as a party attending a

6

trial, and -- and go to the further extent of -- of giving

7

you some kind of a privilege to preclude discovery, which

does not personally involve the President?

Well, Mr. Justice Souter, it's the

realities of real-world litigation.

How -- how is

-- I mean, the President isn't going

to attend these depositions; you are.

18

MR. BENNETT:

But in the real world of

19

litigation, Mr. Justice Souter, do you think when

20

Mr. Davis, as he -- as he claims, that he's going to be

21

deposing all of the troopers; and any time the President

22

of the United States has come into contact with a member

of the opposite sex, he intends to inquire of that; this

is a conspiracy complaint; they talk about pattern of

QUESTION:

Yes, but, Mr. Bennett --

2

MR. BENNETT:

-- don't you think I'm going to

3

have to talk to the President of United States about all

4

those events?

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Mr. Bennett, do you think all those

7

events are relevant to this case?
MR. BENNETT:

9
10

11
12

13

I think some trial courts would

say they are not and some trial courts might -- might say
they are.

We haven't gotten to that question yet.
QUESTION:

How long do you think -- how long --

how long do you think it will take to try this case?
MR. BENNETT:

It's impossible to say.

I can

14

tell you the President has spent -- personally spent a

15

substantial amount of time on this case already.

16

this is a personal -- the very nature of this case is so

17

personal that it would require his heavy involvement.

18

QUESTION:

I mean,

But -- but there are -- there are two

19

elements here really -- a concern about some conflict with

20

a judge deciding how to weigh the interests of the

21

President in attending a NATO meeting or something versus

22

a desire to avoid damage control politically.

23

there an element of that in here?

24

into the constitutional balance?

MR. BENNETT:

QUESTION:

3

Yet could be the concern about damage

4

control, at bottom, would motivate, not necessarily this

5

President, but any President, in wanting to spend a little

6

time with the lawyer as these allegations are made.

7

is that part of our constitutional balance?
MR. BENNETT:

8

9

But

Well, Your Honor, I don't think we

can -- I think -- there's no perfect answer to this.

But

10

I certainly don't think that you can permit the courts to

11

start deciding what presidential priorities are or are

12

not.

13

QUESTION:

Why can't we wait until the President

14

asserts such a conflict?

15

of hundred years.

16

Mr. President, I want you here for this deposition and, if

17

you don't come, you're going to lose the case; and the

18

President says, I'm sorry, I have to go to a NATO meeting?

19

Why don't we wait for that, what seems to me, very

20

unlikely situation to arise?

21

It's never happened in a couple

Why can't we wait until the court says,

MR. BENNETT:

Well, I'm not so sure, in today's

22

climate, that it is unlikely to arise.

23

could wait, as you say.

to deal with now.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

4

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

6

MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

7

Let me begin by responding to Justice Scalia's

8

question about the source of law.

9

based.

It is constitutionally

In our view, Justice Scalia, it comes from this

10

Court's -- the same basis that this Court stated in its

11

different opinion in Fitzgerald, where they considered the

12

immunity there, quote, a functionally mandated incident of

3

the President's unique office.

4

Article II.

5

That is, it arises from

That's --

QUESTION:

Yeah, but to the extent that Nixon v.

6

Fitzgerald involved some activity of the President that

7

relates to his duties in office as President, that is an

8

element that does not extend to this case.

9
20

MR. DELLINGER:

That is correct, Justice

O' Connor.

QUESTION:

language, as there often is, in Court opinions.

Constitution that we look to, to govern this -- this

MR. DELLINGER:

1

You are correct, Justice

2

O'Connor, that it is a different issue in Fitzgerald.

3

what Fitzgerald stands for is the proposition that this

4

Court can announce rules of law which are binding on State

5

and Federal courts, as the Fitzgerald immunity surely is

6

binding in State and Federal courts.
QUESTION:

7

But

Well, what is it in the Constitution

8

that makes the immunity, let's say, of a Federal judge or

9

the immunity of any Federal employee for acts of official

10

duty binding in a State court, where that activity might

11

itself constitute a tort under State law?

12

the Constitution that binds the State courts so that the

13

State court can't proceed?

14

I mean, I --

15

MR. DELLINGER:

What is it in

Is this the supremacy clause?

Yes.

Yes.

The -- to the extent

16

that it's based upon Federal law, it is the supremacy

17

clause.

To the extent that it's --

18

QUESTION:

So if there is a separation of powers

19

doctrine that creates a -- a -- call it a Federal common

20

law-type immunity, then that immunity for judges or anyone

21

else is binding upon the State courts because of the

22

supremacy?

separation of powers.
MR. DELLINGER:

2

I believe that the Fitzgerald

3

immunity clearly applies to actions brought in State

4

court.

5

that a doctrine of immunity for presidential actions, in

6

the official capacity --

Surely the Court in Fitzgerald did not announce

7

QUESTION:

But isn't the reason for that that

8

the immunity in a Federal court would be meaningless if it

9

were subject to an end run, and that's how the supremacy

10

clause translates a separation of powers doctrine into a

11

State court immunity; isn't that the way it works?

12

MR. DELLINGER:

13

QUESTION:

That is exactly correct.

But a good -- a good deal of your

14

Federal official immunity for Federal comes by statute

15

from Congress, not from the Constitution.

16

MR. DELLINGER:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, some of that comes by --

And that of course isn't -- we're not

18

faced with a situation where Congress has passed a law

19

granting this immunity.
MR. DELLINGER:

21

That is correct, Mr. Chief

Justice --

QUESTION:

Let me -- I don't understand how

2

or not.

3

It's simply the supremacy clause that says State

MR. DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

6

You don't need separation of powers

to get there.

7
8

Well, Justice --

MR. DELLINGER:

No.

You need -- what you need

is Article II, as informed by the separation of powers.

9

QUESTION:

Right, right.

10

MR. DELLINGER:

11

QUESTION:

Nixon v. --

So that keeps the State courts out.

12

And then you have the doctrine of separation of powers,

13

which keeps the Federal courts out.

14

MR. DELLINGER:

15

QUESTION:

Okay.

Yes, that is correct.
Well, that's quite different

16

from saying we've extended -- somehow we make a ruling on

17

separation of powers for the Federal courts and that

18

automatically slops over to the State courts.

19

MR. DELLINGER:

20

QUESTION:

No.

On the other hand, the case such as

21

Toddles case, which says that a State -- or a State court

22

-- cannot enjoin a Federal official, have to do with a

QUESTION:

Mr. Dellinger, can I ask you about

6

MR. DELLINGER:

Yes.

Your brief and the brief of the

Petitioner both make a lot about the fact that the

9

President is -- you know, it's a full-time job and he --

10

he's very -- and any intrusion upon his time is intruding.

11

I must say, I don't find that terribly persuasive.

12

fact is that -- that that's a better reason why the Chief

13

Justice or any of the Justices of this Court should have

the kind of immunity you're talking about, or the Speaker

I think it could interfere with

the workings of the presidency, and therefore would urge

that discovery be postponed, except for lost evidence that

Because I think litigation can be all-consuming and

filing of the suit.

There was a suggestion

My own view is that if there is an immunity that

arises under the Constitution and the separation of

powers, that Congress by some affirmative act that says a

21

President now doesn't have that protection, I would be

22

very skeptical whether Congress could do it.

MR. DAVIS:

presidential immunities and the sources of them, and there

were four sources.

Constitution itself, which deals with official power, and

that's purely our point here.

The presidency was a recent, much more

Unless there is an immunity that arises

10

constitutionally, then there should be no bar to the

11

progress of this litigation with the courts sensitive to

12

the burdens of the presidency and should be trusted to do

so.

4

That's another, I think fundamental problem with

5

our opponents, is that they do not have a presumption of

trust that the court will deal with these matters --

a guess, and it may -- and we don't know if the case will

8

QUESTION:

Why would it take 4 or 5 days?

9

MR. DAVIS:

Well, I'm thinking of what some

jurisdictions do.

In Virginia, in Federal or State court

11

it would take probably -- it would take a half-an-hour in

12

the Eastern District, but --

MR. DAVIS:

long, and there's a point to be made about that also.

It could very well be.

Do you

It could

And if it then were in that degree,

10

you think that he'd be entitled to an order deferring the

12

MR. DAVIS:

If there was no way, at that time --

13

this is ab initio, but at that time, if there was no other

14

way to accommodate his needs, the presidency's needs for

15

him to perform that job, then a continuance might very

well be appropriate.

That's something of a perverse

also trust the court to make a judgment up front that

3

there are going to be so many specific instances, and the

so many specific instances are going to be so costly to

the President that the only practical thing is to make a

7

If we can trust the court to make the first two

kinds of good judgments, why can't we trust a court to

9

make that third kind?

MR. DAVIS:

In an appropriate circumstance, and

11

you're getting to the question of a stay by the district

judge as a discretionary matter rather than as a --

13

QUESTION:

Well, they're all discretionary.

14

MR. DAVIS:

Well, I think she did this --

15

QUESTION:

I mean, it's an exercise of the

court's discretion in each instance.
