ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. PATRICIA SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

11

MS. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
State laws of general applicability relate to ERISA

12

plans only when they both operate upon a plan in its capacity

13

as a plan, and when the effect of that law is to dictate or

14

restrict and not merely influence plan choice.

15

The health facility assessment, a gross receipts tax

16

imposed upon hospitals in New York, does not relate to ERISA

17

plans which operate their own hospitals because neither of

18

these elements is present.

19

The impact of the HFA upon plans is no more than that of

20

the laws that were upheld by this Court in the Blue Cross v.

21

Travelers case and the Court's recent opinion in California v.

22

Dillingham.

23

restrict plan choice.

24
25

Like those laws, the HFA does not dictate or

Like the surcharges in Travelers, the HFA may have an
economic impact upon a plan's cost of providing benefits.

1

This impact may occur regardless of whether plans own their

2

own hospitals or purchase hospital care services from third

3

parties.

4

not enough to make the law relate to plans.

5

In either case, the economic impact of the law is

Notwithstanding the fund's ownership of the hospital in

6

this case, the HFA also does not relate to the plan because it

7

operates upon the fund not in its capacity as a plan but as a

8

provider of medical services.

9

the State regulation of hospitals, and the provision of

The HFA is part and parcel of

10

medical services is not a plan function which ERISA preemption

11

was designed to protect.

12

When plans choose to provide the types of benefits which

3

are not strictly financial but which involve services, those

4

services remain subject to generally applicable State

5

regulation whether plans purchase those services from third

6

parties or choose to provide those services in kind.

operation of a hospital, like the operation of a day care

8

center, the practice of law, and employees' training programs,

are not plan functions --

QUESTION:

The

Ms. Smith, do you agree with the outline

21

offered by the Solicitor General as sort of a summary of this

22

Court's holdings in this area?

23

MS. SMITH:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, Your Honor.
Would you adopt the same outline yourself

without variation?

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, the outline of this -- what this

2

Court has decided --

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, they construct a kind of four-part

simple test.

5

MS. SMITH:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. SMITH:

Yes.
Do you agree with that?
Yes, Your Honor.

Where we differ from the

8

Solicitor is not necessarily in outcome but somewhat in

9

analysis.

10

In this case, the respondents, who would agree that many

11

generally applicable laws would not relate to them even if

12

they were imposed directly upon them, respondents claim that

13

this case is different because when you operate your own

14

hospital you're acting as a provider of medical services,

15

which they say is what an ERISA plan is meant to do.

16

QUESTION:

And do you agree that all general health laws

17

that would affect clinic operations are validly applied to an

18

ERISA health clinic?

19

MS. SMITH:

20

QUESTION:

21
22

Yes, Your Honor.
The standards of degrees required for people

engaged in the health care business, and so forth?
MS. SMITH:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

When the State is

23

regulating generally in the health care area, those are areas

24

of traditional State concern.

25

operate in those areas, they take basically the marketplace as

1

the State is regulating the marketplace of those areas.
QUESTION:

2

3

And I suppose there might be some

disagreement by respondents on that issue.
MS. SMITH:

4

The respondents' argument is that at least

5

in the health care area, but I think that their theory is

6

equally applicable to those other four benefit areas that

7

involve services -- day care, prepaid legal services, and

8

apprenticeship training -- that when plans operate in those

9

areas, the State may not regulate them.

10

not tax them, I believe is the respondents' argument.
Our disagreement is that in those areas, those services

11
12

remain subject to State regulation.

13

as

14

At least, they may

QUESTION:

One looks at the plan

Well, do you think the same principles should

15

govern whether a general tax law or a general State

16

requirement for background training or cleanliness concerns or

17

something of that kind --

18

20

both questions?

21

MS. SMITH:

In these --- the same principles govern the answer to

In these service areas -- in these service

22

areas, yes, so a generally applicable health care tax, a

23

generally applicable day care tax, or in these four service

24

areas, whether, if you can regulate in those areas in a

25

generally applicable way you can tax in those areas in a

1

generally applicable way.
QUESTION:

2

Ms. Smith, I don't understand what you think

3

the effect of the very broad language, relates to, is.

4

does it bring to this enterprise that we're engaging in that

5

wouldn't be affected by our ordinary preemption principles?
MS. SMITH:

6

What

Justice Scalia, the way that the Court has

7

formulated preemption analysis to date, there are two prongs.

8

There's the refer-to prong, as the Court refers to it, and the

9

connection prong.
What the relates-to analysis does to date is that if you

10
11

had general preemption provisions, conflict-of-field

12

preemption provisions, a State law which referred to ERISA

13

plan which kept them out of those fields would not be

14

preempted.

15

But to date, the -- this Court has held that a State law

16

which specifically refers to ERISA plans, even if it gives

17

ERISA plans better protection -- for instance, in the Mackey

18

case the part of the law that required the State garnishment

19

law not to apply to ERISA plans this Court held was preempted,

20

so

21

QUESTION:

But that's normal field preemption, isn't it,

22

that you cannot -- you can neither reduce nor increase the

23

protection that the Federal Government gives.

24

normal field preemption would produce.

25

MS. SMITH:

That's what

My understanding of field preemption, Your

8
1

Honor, is that a State law that specifically kept whatever was

2

being regulated out of the field would not be preempted.
QUESTION:

3
4

I don't know what you mean.

What -- that

kept whatever was being regulated out of the field?
MS. SMITH:

5

Right.

For instance, if it was a question

6

of nuclear safety and the law said something about State,

7

whatever -- and you can't be in the nuclear safety area, that

8

that would not be preempted.

9

field preemption.

That is my understanding of

But in this case, when the State garnishment law says

10

11

ERISA plans are not subject to the garnishment law, this Court

12

has held that because it specifically referred to and applied

13

only to ERISA plans, it was not preempted -- it was preempted,

14

sorry.

15

QUESTION:

In any event, do I understand that -- you

16

said you agreed with the Government's outline as a summary of

17

what this Court has held, that however you might wish Justice

18

Scalia's concurring opinion in the Dillingham case to be

19

speaking for the majority, the majority has not yet spoke that

20

way.

21
22

23
24
25

MS. SMITH:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We do agree

with the Government's outline.
QUESTION:

But how would this case come out, do you

think, under Justice Scalia's field preemption theory?
MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, we are asking the Court

1

basically, in making this distinction between services and

2

plans, to carve out --

3

QUESTION:

Well, I think the question I asked you was,

4

how would the case come out if you were to apply normal field

5

preemption principles to it?

6

MS. SMITH:

It would come out that this law does not

7

relate to plans because the service area is outside the field

8

of employee benefit plans, that while employee benefit plans

9

are concerned with the funding and payment of benefits, that

10

the services which those benefit payments may fund, the

11

quantity of the services, the quality of the services, the

12

availability of the services, are not an area with which ERISA

13

is concerned with.

14

QUESTION:

But does it work to distinguish that which is

15

doing the providing, namely the plan, and that which the plan

16

buys, like the services?

17

I mean, that distinction seems to run throughout the

18

cases, but for the area of pensions itself, where the fund is

19

basically writing a check, so it's quite closely tied up with

20

the fund.

21

But in the benefits area, they're buying something, so

22

is it the case -- how does that distinction work between the

23

plan itself -- this is another case in which we've -- other

24

cases have tried to make the same distinction.

25

Government's tended to resist it, I think -- and that which

The

the plan buys.
When you get to that which the plan buys, there's no

2

3

field preemption.

4

which the plan buys and the State's regulating that conflicts

5

specifically with the purpose of Congress.
MS. SMITH:

6

Rather, you look bit-by-bit to see if that

That distinction works very well, Your

7

Honor.

8

they're not buying anything.

10

In this case, the respondents are claiming that

they went and supplied it themselves.

MS. SMITH:

QUESTION:

13

MS. SMITH:

14
15

No, no, but that just happens to be because

Right, but -That's just an artifact of the situation.

we are asking the Court to draw.

There are only four ERISA benefits that actually involve

services.

21

that would be day care, apprenticeship training, prepaid legal

services, and health --

In other words, services that plans may buy, and

QUESTION:

I mean, you've really looked into this a lot,

24

and so what I'm quite serious is -- if there were some words

25

in an opinion that said when you look into that area which,

(800) FOR DEPO

11
1

when you look into those things which the plan buys, as

2

opposed to the management of a trust, when you look into that

3

area, normally there is no preemption unless the State law

4

conflicts with a purpose of Congress, and a rather specific

5

purpose at that.

6

Now, would that cause trouble?

7

MS. SMITH:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

No, Your Honor, not in our view.
Not in this case it wouldn't but I mean, in

your experience in general would it cause trouble?
MS. SMITH:

No, Your Honor, not in our view, because in

11

general, again, we're dealing with a very limited area of

12

ERISA benefits that actually involve something that the plan

13

purchases as opposed to money that the plan is giving, and

14

when ERISA plans are operating as ordinary commercial

15

entities, they may well purchase services.

16

They may purchase -- they may purchase, you know,

17

fiduciary services.

18

purchase whatever, and clearly we don't think that anyone

19

would contest that when they're operating in those commercial

20

capacities, purchasing those entities, that ERISA preemption

21

would apply.

22

They may purchase stationery.

They may

Whether you --

QUESTION:

But you don't want to draw a line --

the

23

difference between buying the service, because I think this is

24

a case where the plan itself is providing it, so I think in

25

your brief you try to look at the other side of it and say

12
1

when you're talking about plan funding, plan administration,

2

that's what ERISA covers.

3

MS. SMITH:

That's correct, Your Honor, but you could

4

also look at this when an ERISA plan provides services in

5

kind, they're simply purchasing them in a different way.

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. SMITH:

Yes -Instead of purchasing them from a third

8

party, they are directly purchasing them from the doctors

9

and - -

10

QUESTION:

But it would have a direct financial effect.

11

If the ERISA plan buys clinic services elsewhere in New York,

12

then this tax is going to be paid by the entity that actually

13

provides the service, and so it may in fact cost ERISA

14

something less, because it's not paying the tax.

15

MS. SMITH:

16

QUESTION:

Your Honor -But if it were to provide the services

17

itself, then the ERISA plan is certainly liable for the full

18

tax, so it may end up costing ERISA less to contract out.

19

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, in this case the incidence of

20

the tax is not on the ERISA plan but on the hospital which,

21

although it's not critical to my argument, is a separately

22

incorporated corporation.

23

The hospital can, like any other entity, determine how

24

it's going to fund the tax.

25

customers, in this case, the ERISA plan participants, in

It could pass it on to its

In this particular case, it could decide to pass it on

It's really no different than if it's Mount Sinai that's

9

centers themselves.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

It's the medical

But what I run into, you know, with my own

thought there is, I run into a problem.
I mean, I can easily say, let's distinguish what's

13

normally bought, even though in your case it happens to be

14

provided, from the running of the fund, and let's say in the

15

former situation and grouping your case with the former,

16

normally there is no preemption unless you find a specific

17

conflict.

18

Then I run into these -- the benefit cases where the

19

fund was buying certain medical benefits, really, and the

20

Court said no, it's preempted where you have the pregnancy --

21

you know, the certain rules on what you can buy or not buy,

22

which were really regulations of what was bought, rather than

23

regulations of the fund, so how do you work with those cases?

24
25

MS. SMITH:

Your Honor, in those cases you're impacting

upon what the fund is paying, what services, as opposed to the

So, for instance, the State of New York can regulate

No one can have surgery unless there's a

What the court -- what the State can't say is, and

6

7

anyone who pays for the surgery must also pay for the second

8

opinion, because you're dealing with coverage issues:

what is

a plan paying for, as opposed to what services are available
10

in the marketplace.
If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I will

reserve the rest of my time.

traditional State regulation.
The legal incidence of the tax, and in tax law legal

2

3

incidence is often very important, is on hospitals.

The

4

impact on the plan is only incidental from its capacity as the

5

owner of the hospital.

6

as such.

It is not on the plan in its capacity

The assessment law, therefore, does not relate to the

7
8

ERISA plan at issue in this case because it does not intrude

9

into the field of regulation of ERISA welfare benefit plans

10

which section 514(a) preserves for exclusive Federal

11

regulation.

12

The purpose of section 514(a) --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler -Yes.

-- how do you think the so-called field

preemption notice, the field preemption doctrine would play

17

out in these ERISA cases --

18

MR. KNEEDLER:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think --

-- and how would that apply here?
In this case, the field preemption

21

analysis would certainly lead to sustaining the State tax,

22

because the State tax operates, again, in the area of health

23

care.

It operates with respect to a facility owned by the

24

plan.

It does not operate in the field of ERISA plans as

25

such, and therefore we think it would not be preempted.

3
4

QUESTION:

Do you think that principle would explain

most or all of our previous cases?
MR. KNEEDLER:

It would explain most.

It would not

5

explain all.

I agree with counsel for the State that it would

6

not in particular explain the Mackey case, or not as readily.

7

The portion --

8

QUESTION:

Which is what?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

The portion of the Mackey case that held

10

that an express exemption from State garnishment laws for

11

ERISA plans was preempted.

12

Ordinarily, when you have field preemption, if the State

13

enacts a law that gets State law out of the way to secure the

14

field for Federal occupation, that would ordinarily not be

15

something that would be preempted by field preemption.

16

Having said that, with all respect, there is a bit of an

17

anomaly about having an express exception for ERISA plans in a

18

case like Mackey preempted where the State is trying to clear

19

the way for exclusive Federal regulation and get out of the

20

way something that is beneficial to a plan, not something that

21

rule we were applying in the earlier cases as compared with

2

the expression that we've used in the last few?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

I think the Court's more recent

4

cases have tended to focus on the objectives of the -- of

5

ERISA, and that can be tied, we think, rather directly as a

6

textual matter to the field preemption argument.

7

QUESTION:

What is the field preemption?

That is to

10

If a State passes a

that the State not pass this kind of law, then it's preempted.

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

12

QUESTION:

Right.

Is that called conflict preemption, or field

13

preemption?

I mean, in the instance when there is no direct

14

conflict, I mean, isn't it in both instances a question of

15

looking to the purpose of Congress and seeing if this is the

16

kind of law that --

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

18

QUESTION:

Right.

Now, in this case --

If that's right, then if you use the word

field preemption, what will it do in general?

be used?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

How should it

Well, for example, it's very important

22

under ERISA because the Court has said on a number of

23

occasions, and we agree with this, that ERISA preempts State

24

laws in some circumstances even where ERISA itself does not

25

furnish governing law, in particular in the design of ERISA

1

plans themselves, what benefits to offer, who they would be

2

paid for, paid to, what the amount of them will be.

3

Even though ERISA does not dictate particular benefit

4

levels, its purpose was to leave that to employers and

5

employees to negotiate to come up -- to leave to private

6

ordering, and so State law that would regulate the benefit

7

structure, even though it doesn't conflict with any particular

8

provision of ERISA addressing that, would conflict with

9

Congress' purpose to insulate that from State regulation.

10

11

QUESTION:

In a broad sense, Mr. Kneedler, I suppose any

preemption involves a conflict.

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's --

Any preemption is conflict preemption.
In that sense, under this, and

15

particularly when you have an express preemption clause,

16

anything that conflicts with the express preemption clause.

17

QUESTION:

And I thought in our cases what conflict

preemption meant was, where an inconsistent obligation is

QUESTION:

MR. KNEEDLER:

3
4

Yes.
Which affecting benefit structure would,

we think -QUESTION:

Whereas I thought we've said field preemption

5

would apply where the Federal law tells you to do X, and the

State law says do X plus

7

but you're doing more than X.

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

QUESTION:

0, which wouldn't -- you're doing X,

Right.

But if the Government wanted this thing to be

10

complete, and we're occupying the field, you're not supposed

11

to address this area at all, X plus

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

0 would be preempted.

That's correct, and so the sorts of

3

things that are occupied by the field, some of them are

4

addressed by ERISA itself, but things having to do with the

5

internal management of the plan -- benefit structures,

6

investment decisions, fiduciary responsibilities, things

having to do with the way the administrator handles the

plan -- and with respect to those things, we think the things

that the State can't regulate it ordinarily can't tax.

ordinarily can tax, and it's instructive that subsection

for that does not affect State tax laws as they may relate to

ERISA plans, and the background and structure of that shows,

1

we think, that Congress intended that State tax laws be

2

treated generally as -- the same way that regulation is and,

3

after all, tax is a species of regulation.

4

QUESTION:

Well, how would field preemption play out in

5

the context of direct State regulations going to the

6

educational background of employees in the clinic, and

7

cleanliness requirements, and so forth?

8

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

As to that, they would not be preempted

because they do not address the internal affairs of an ERISA

10

plan as such in its capacity as a plan with respect to

11

funding, and financing, and what services will be paid for.

12

Such a State law regulates the services that are in turn

13

either purchased or furnished in kind by the ERISA plan, so

14

under that view of field preemption what the -- the field the

15

State is in is substantive health care regulation, licensing

16

of the facility and what-not.

17

And in general, the distinction that Justice Breyer made

18

we would agree with, and it was essentially our position in

19

Travelers as well that where the ERISA plan steps out of its

20

internal management of plan structure and purchases something

21

in the market, either pencils for the office or services in

22

kind, State substantive regulation or taxation of a -- a sales

23

tax for purchasing something wouldn't be preempted.

What taxes does

21
1

MR. KNEEDLER:

We think it would have to pay, for

2

example, unemployment compensation taxes that -- for its

3

employees.

4

We think, on the other hand, if the State tried to tax

5

the income to the plan itself, which is a species perhaps of

6

regulating the corpus of the trust funds, if there's a

7

separate trust fund, if the State tries to regulate the corpus

8

of the trust by regulating investment decisions, we think

9

that's at the core of what ERISA would not allow, and

10

therefore it may well be that the State could not tax the

11

corpus of the trust itself.

12

But where the State is leaving -- or the trust, the plan

13

is leaving its internal operations and going out into the

14

marketplace by hiring employees or purchasing goods and

15

services, including services in kind that are paid for by the

16

ERISA plan --

What if the State taxes numerous other

corpuses that have nothing to do with ERISA plans as well?

That would -- it's that point we think

22

that may make that a closer question, and we would urge the

23

Court not to decide that question in this case.

22
1

wouldn't that be because you think that there is an indication

2

in the legislation that Congress did not want it taxed?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

Congress intended to preserve the

4

assets in the fund for the benefit of the employees, but we

5

think that that could also be a species of field preemption,

6

because the State could not directly regulate investment

7

decisions by holding fiduciaries to different standards or

8

requiring diversification requirements in the portfolio.

9

QUESTION:

But that's just why -- that's exactly why I'm

nervous about the words, field preemption, because in trying

to work out what the field is you have to make roughly the

same analysis that you'd have to make on purpose.

field preemption, how would you use it?

I would, I think, refer to whether the

State law is addressing the ERISA plan as an ERISA plan, in

17

its capacity as an ERISA plan, not when it is purchasing goods

and services outside of the plan's operations.

We are dealing here with a State tax on the corpus of

the fund.

4

being paid to the fund by the employers required under the

5

collective bargaining agreements to make those contributions,

6

and benefit payments being made for the benefits that the

ERISA fund is paying, so this case involves a tax.

What's being taxed are the contributions that are

That is the language of the statute.

And when the fund is being required to pay a State

assessment on the very activities that makes the fund a fund,

the very health care benefits that the fund is paying out, the

contributions that the employers are paying for those

benefits, I submit to you that it's self-evident that the tax

in this case relates to the fund.

QUESTION:

Why not the sales tax on items that the fund

uses to operate?
MR. CARUSO:

I think in that case the fund is actually

there is, we would tend to agree that if you use the concept

QUESTION:

But when the plan is operating a private

hospital, why shouldn't it be treated like any other hospital?
MR. CARUSO:

6

Because a plan does provide benefits.

If

7

you look at the definition of ERISA, ERISA says that any plan

8

or program to provide health benefits through insurance or

9

otherwise, and the ERISA definition -QUESTION:

10

What about other benefits that a plan might

provide, like legal services?

that?

MR. CARUSO:

Do you say the same thing about

Well, if the plan is providing legal

services and there's been a tax imposed on the contributions

15

that the plan is providing to the attorneys who are providing

16

the services, I would say yes, that that tax would be

17

preempted, because that tax is being imposed on the very

18

activities that make the plan a plan.

19

QUESTION:

Well, what about the State requirement that

anyone giving legal services has to be a licensed attorney?

say there, there you are taxing the plan as a plan.
QUESTION:

But my question related not to the tax but to

this sure knowledge that the State law requirement that legal

advice be given by licensed attorneys will cost more.

QUESTION:

Doesn't that reference to State tax laws

refer to the specific provisions for the Hawaiian plans?
MR. CARUSO:

I think it refers to the Hawaiian plan, but

what it says is, it kind of mirrors the language of the

5

preemption clause and says State tax laws that relate to plans

6

shall not -- shall be preempted, in essence.

9

I'm

And I think the concern there was that the Hawaii -- the
dispensation for the Hawaii plan might have created some

10

indications that there were certain tax aspects of the Hawaii

plan, that in fact Hawaii in some prior litigation involving a

12

prototype of its plan had taken the position that the State

13

enactment there was a tax, and therefore there was some Tenth

14

Amendment protection.

15

There's some indication then that Congress was

specifically concerned about the approach being taken by

17

Hawaii in this prior litigation and saw the need to point out,

would have thought that provide means -- in order to have

general application, I would have thought that provide meant,

provide the means or the funds for the purchase or obtaining

of these various kinds of benefits, and if it -- if provide is

defined in the latter way, then I take it that would be the

8

end of your argument, but perhaps I don't understand your

argument.
MR. CARUSO:

10

Of course, I disagree with your definition

4

QUESTION:

No, but on my theory, if we're going to treat

pro -- if we're going to treat the word provide as, in effect,

6

synonymous with financing, then it would follow that the

7

taxation here is not on the ERISA plan as the financing

authority but, rather, on the ERISA plan wearing a different

9

hat in operating a hospital, and if that's the way we analyze

10
11

it, then I take it your argument would fail.
MR. CARUSO:

I mean, that's one way to look at it, but

12

the way I look at it, if Congress said that a State law

that -- a State tax law that relates to a plan is preempted,

You don't see which, that -I do not see that anything in ERISA would

17

suggest that the State could not exercise its traditional

18

police powers in regulating health care service.

19

What I say here is, though, that when I look at ERISA

20

there is a specific provision on taxation.

21

when the tax is being imposed on the plan when the plan is

engaging in hospital --

then what is your distinction between the tax -MR. CARUSO:

I would hope you wouldn't do that, because

I think if you looked in 1974, the executive branch actually

went to Congress and said to Congress --

And now

the special reference to taxation that you find.

I mean, it's just contrary to the

money from the State, from -- and putting it into the State's

compensation, sales tax, that's all okay, even though that

18

comes out of the corpus.

19

MR. CARUSO:

I agree with you.

What I'm saying, when

20

it's being imposed on the fund's contributions and benefit

21

plans, not on it's incidental activities in providing the

22

services, and I think if you take the position -- what I'm

23

particularly concerned about is if we're going to slice it

24

that thin, that what's to prevent the States from taxing the

25

income of the funds, from tax -- if they're allowed to tax the

contributions, that's the corpus.
QUESTION:

I mean --

The line, I think, that they want to draw,

3

the Government, is to say, distinguish between, in the benefit

4

area, that which does the buying, namely the plan, and that

5

which is bought, namely, the benefits, and in the case where

6

you're talking about the latter, by and large you can impose

7

uniform taxes, and if it turns out that in a particular

8

instance the former, namely that which does the buying, itself

9

decides to provide that which is normally bought, it's treated

10
11
12

as if it bought it.
Now, that's a clear line.

It's administrable.

MR. CARUSO:

Well, if you took that approach, then

Yes.
--if ERISA --an ERISA plan cannot be

defined as the direct provider.

That's what you're in essence

20

saying, that it really becomes the hospital, even though

21

becoming the hospital is what an ERISA plan is supposed to do.

22

QUESTION:

Well, they don't always -- they don't

23

necessarily -- the ERISA plan I take it in many instances buys

24

hospital care from others.

MR. CARUSO:

It doesn't often --

It does that on occasion.

QUESTION:

MR. CARUSO:

3
4

Yes, well -In that situation then it would be treated

like other buyers.
QUESTION:

So why -- but if you take your position, then

5

what you do is, you simply get the ERISA plans themselves,

6

through a real tax advantage, to start going into the

7

businesses of providing those things which normally would be

8

bought from others, and they'd get a tax break.

9

would Congress want that?

10

MR. CARUSO:

Why?

Why

Because Congress has done it that way, and

11

I think you'll find that if you look at the Metropolitan Life

12

case, that the same type of special status was given to self-

13

insured plans.

14

QUESTION:

So your actual answer, if you happen to have

15

an ERISA plan that bought paid vacations for its employees,

16

and they decide to go into the travel business limited to

17

employees, the answer then to the question is, they're tax

18

exempt, right, in your view?

19

MR. CARUSO:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CARUSO:

22

QUESTION:

Correct.
Yes, okay.
Correct.
But am I correct in understanding you do --

23

you would not make the same argument about regulations such as

24

the requirement of a second opinion of a physician?

25

MR. CARUSO:

That's correct.

Your Honor, the HFA is not a tax on benefit

The characterization is equally applicable to any time a

It's a

20

simply income.

21

Secondly, in these service areas, if you can regulate

22

these entities, you should tax them, you should be able to tax

23

them, because ERISA makes no distinction in its preemption

that ERISA plans are carte blanche exempt from Federal and

I would urge you in this case not to get into a general
