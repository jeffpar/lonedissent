CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

:04 a.m.)

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the value of

3

collateral that a Chapter

4

should be determined by what the secured creditor could obtain

5

if it foreclosed on that property and sold it, or by what the

6

debtor would have to pay in order to acquire a comparable

7

property.

8
9

3 debtor proposes to retain and use

Our argument is that Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code declares that the value of the property should vary,

20

depending on whether it is proposed to be used or proposed to

21

be disposed of, and that a hypothetical disclosure value is

22

insufficient and ignores the language of the statute.

23

Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred when it undervalued

24

the secured interest of the Petitioner in this case.

25

This is a Chapter

3 case in which the Respondents

proposed a plan that would permit them to keep a tractor

2

trailer truck, which served as collateral for a debt owed to

3

the Petitioner.

4

was owed approximately -- well, not approximately -- was owed

5

$41,171, and it had perfected a lien on the -- under State

6

law.

7

At the time of the bankruptcy, the Petitioner

Petitioner sought, under Section 362, to lift the

8

automatic stay and to repossess the truck.

Respondents

9

objected, sought to keep the truck as necessary for their

10

reorganization, and asked the court to value the truck at

11

$28,500.

12

then to strip the lien from the -- from the Petitioner.

They proposed to pay that amount, plus interest, and

Both sides offered expert testimony on the value of the

13
14

truck.

15

$42,500.

16

Respondents' expert also valued it at wholesale, at $31,875,

17

which he got to by discounting by 25 percent the retail value.

18

And all of these numbers were derived, essentially, from

19

standard industry bluebooks.

20

The Respondents' expert valued it at retail, at
Our expert valued it at $41,000.

And the -- the

The Bankruptcy Court, the District Court and the Court

21

of Appeals all concluded that, under these circumstances, they

22

had to decide the question as a matter of law, which is the

23

proper method of valuation, wholesale or retail.

24

they quite properly turned to Section 506(a) of the Code.

25

Unfortunately, they misconstrued that provision.

In doing so,

506(a) has two sentences.

The first sentence tells you

2

what you value.

3

phrase simply tells you that you value the creditor's

4

collateral.

5

value the collateral.

6

And as this Court held in Timbers, that

The first sentence says nothing about how you

The second sentence, which is reproduced on page 3 of

7

the Petitioner's brief, says that the way you value collateral

8

is that you -- is that you value -- shall be determined in

9

light of the proposed disposition or use of such property.

10

Now, the Court is fond of observing, generally speaking,
that - QUESTION:

You left out part of the sentence, though, I

think, didn't you, Mr. Phillips?

That's true.

No, in light of the purpose of the valuation

and of proposed disposition.
MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Although

5

there is no dispute between the parties about the purpose of

6

the valuation, so I -- I skipped over that.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

What was the purpose of the valuation?
Well, the purpose of the valuation here

was to decide the full extent of our --of our collateral, for

10

purposes of deciding how much money should be paid as part of

placed on it, that the reorganization might not have occurred

They couldn't have

And then your client would have had to

MR. PHILLIPS:

That -- that is correct, Your Honor.

But

19

we would have been perfectly happy with that, because that's

20

what we proposed in the first instance.

21

clear, and it's simply speculation as to whether or not this

22

Chapter 13 reorganization would have succeeded or not.

23

QUESTION:

But it's not at all

Well, in any event, the thing proceeded, and

24

Respondents made payments for 5 years, and presumably have

25

completed this thing.

Now, if you prevail, what's going to

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

Well, what the Respondent said in

3

opposition to the stay in the Bankruptcy Court was that they

4

remain on the hook to pay back Associates for the amount of

5

money that's owed.

7

should have paid.

on the truck as far as the debtor is concerned at this point

11

be taken into consideration in setting a value?
MR. PHILLIPS:

12

Does that have to

Well, the appraiser can -- ordinarily, I

3

think the appraiser would take into consideration what is on

4

the truck.

the truck that that particular - QUESTION:

Right.

But then the appraiser could --

could adjust it, to take into account precisely what's on the

20

truck.

Just as if, for some reason, there was something very

21

special that he put on the truck that he paid for that wasn't

22

part of the secured interest.

23

the higher value of that, as we say in the brief.

24

you would look at it as a truck to replace, essentially, what

25

the secured interest is, what is the collateral.

I don't think that we would get

You know,

QUESTION:

Well, just on this preliminary point, there

2

was some payment to be made to the unsecured creditors I think

3

a few years down the line, was there not?

4
5
6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, there was money paid to unsecured

creditors.
QUESTION:

All right.

So -- so if the replacement value

7

had been granted, maybe this is just a question between the

8

secured and unsecured creditors, not between the debtor and

9

the secured creditors?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Generally speaking, that is going to be

11

the case.

Is this -- the question is whether or not the

12

unsecureds get anything - -

13

QUESTION

Well, then --

14

QUESTION

Sorry.

15

QUESTION

No, that's okay.

16

QUESTION

Were you finished?

17

QUESTION

Or if it would be the case, and I think it

18
19

would be.
The words "wholesale" and "retail" don't appear in this

20

statute.

21

bankruptcy judge, pretty much.

22

bankruptcy judge be sensible in saying, well, the value

23

includes whatever will be disputed between the unsecured and

24

secured creditors?

So I take it Congress wanted to leave it up to the

1

then he can't even go into the -- Chapter 13 because he just

2

doesn't have that money, that couldn't possibly be the value.

3

There's no theory on which that would be the value, because if

4

you value it at that, there won't be a Chapter 13

5

reorganization.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

QUESTION:

Well, but --

So we cut back the value in order to make

8

certain he gets into the reorganization, he puts in his

9

disposable income that you get the amount insofar as it's in

10

dispute between the creditors.
Now, that kind of result seems fair.

11
12

very case specific.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

undo the statute.

And it would be

Well, no, that kind of result seems to
Chapter 13 is not --

15

QUESTION:

It doesn't say.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- essentially, a right that all debtors

17

have.

18

And if their debts are -- are too great to allow them to

19

reorganize under Chapter 13, then they have to put up with --

20

under -- with Chapter 7.

21

They have a choice between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.

QUESTION:

But how could the -- the value for purposes

22

of a Chapter 13 reorganization, insofar as that exceeds what

23

your client would get in a liquidation, couldn't -- it's

24

nonexistent if there isn't going to be a Chapter 13

25

reorganization.

MR. PHILLIPS:

But -- but it seems to me that you -- you

2

-- you have to look at the language of the statute.

3

Section 506(a) says look at the proposed disposition or the

4

proposed use.

5

come out of Chapter 13, then he is required to go under

6

Chapter 7.

7

And

Now, if -- if he cannot use it and successfully

And you don't avoid the Chapter 7 problem by --

QUESTION:

In other words, you -- you don't agree that

8

-- that a secured interest is not a secured interest if -- if

9

its existence would prevent Chapter 13?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

Exactly.

Exactly.

That sounds reasonable to me, too.
Thank you, Your Honor.

Isn't it also relevant, Mr. Phillips, that --

14

and -- the Chapter 13 proposal was not that your client get

15

the security back at whatever value, but that the security

16

remain in the hands of the debtor and continue to depreciate?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's -- that's -- that's exactly right,

18

Mr. Chief Justice.

19

move toward, which is the rule of construction, that the Fifth

20

Circuit relied upon and that I think, really, is where they

21

made the fundamental error in this case, is by saying that the

22

State law rights that are implicated here favor requiring us

23

to show by clear and unambiguous language that our

24

interpretation of the statute is the correct one - -

25

QUESTION:

And -- and the point I was starting to

Mr. Phillips, may I -- may I ask you about

the Fifth Circuit, because I thought that the main point for

Judge King was based on the Federal statute as much -- well,

more than the State law point that you were about to deal

with.

it.

The question that she put was, why should there be

10

different results whether which of those two routes the

11

creditor who doesn't want to go along with the reorganization

12

-- which -- which route that is -- is picked by the debtor.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

And the answer to that is

14

twofold.

15

disposition or proposed use - - which suggests that there are

16

different methods of valuation.

17

reason to assume equivalence between what you do if you give

18

up the property and what you do when you retain the property

19

and use it as part of a successful reorganization.

20

One is that the language suggests -- proposed

And second of all, there's no

parties agree on that.

what - - what rationale would the legislature have for having

2

two different -- one much more favorable to the secured

3

creditor?

4

one logically expect, in the balance between the secured and

5

unsecured, either of those routes to yield the same end

6

result?

7

And I thought that that was the point.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, again, I don't think so.

Wouldn't

And the

8

reason is, in part, the Congress envisioned that there would

9

be negotiations between the parties on these kinds of issues.

10

And you can only negotiate if you have some kind of

11

differential in the valuations.

12

hypothetical foreclosure valuation, you'll always end up with

13

the same number.

14

negotiation between the debtor and the creditor in any

15

particular case.

And if you use the same

Which means there is no basis for

And it seems clearly -- and there's nothing in anything

17

that supports the notion that going along on the disposed use

-- I mean going along with the proposed use, as opposed to

19

proposed disposition, is meant to get you to the same value.

20

It doesn't.

21

22

The assumption is, is that it will create more

QUESTION:

If -- if that is your -- your theory, if we

23

adopt that theory, then would it be an abuse of discretion or

24

a violation of the statute for a judge -- a bankruptcy judge

25

to adopt Judge Posner's solution, which is just split the

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

Yeah, it would be a violation of the

3

statute, because, again, the statute tells you to look at the

proposed use or proposed disposition, and - - and Judge

Posner's analysis does neither of those things.

It does an

It's much like the rule that the Court condemned in

I mean it's a good rule and it might make good

policy and Congress might want to adopt it, but there's

nothing in the statute that -- that remotely supports it.

In particular cases that might be a sensible

17

thing for -- for the -- for the judge to do, I take it.

whether they buy it for a dollar more than the foreclosure

23
24
25

The

And the evidence is

So the only fair thing for me to do in this

I -- I take it you're not ruling out that possibility in
individual cases, or are you?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I'd have to see the particular

14

1

case.

It seems to me that if the evidence in the record is

2

that there are two very distinct appraisal values and they are

3

supported by solid testimony, it seems to me you'd probably be

4

obliged to take one rather than the other, rather than split

5

the difference.

6

QUESTION:

Well, one party says, well -- we -- we can

7

reasonably hypothesize three bidders at the foreclosure for

8

the -- for the disposal of the --of the property, and there's

9

a fight about that.

There might be cases in which the court

10

could say, look, I - - I - - I can't calibrate these

11

probabilities, and the only sensible thing to do is to say

12

it's somewhere in the middle.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

You don't rule out that?

I don't rule that out.

The important

14

part about that, though, to keep in mind is, is that's not the

15

difference between the hypothetical foreclosure value and the

16

use value.

17

are two different use values and trying to resolve those by

18

splitting the difference.

19

What I'm looking at -- what you're talking about

QUESTION:

But your argument is you simply cannot

20

construe the statute, as a matter of law, to require that

21

median figure?

would produce a different valuation.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, my guess is it might make a

22

difference whether or not you are trying to decide whether the

23

outstanding debt puts you into Chapter 13 in the first place,

24

because there are limits on how much debt you can carry into

25

Chapter 13.

So you might value that differently.

Well, if Congress had made clear -- and

QUESTION:

And if you do that, and when you do

that there you would use some kind of a - - a cash flow

MR. DURKAY:

MR. DURKAY:

But under this scenario --

Now, one thing, also, to do with 506 that I think is

There are a lot of other provisions in the

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'll try

to be short or briefer than that.

4

I think, ultimately, the case could be disposed of based

5

on, essentially, Justice Scalia's question, which is, you have

6

language that says "proposed disposition or proposed use."

7

And we -- every example he gave talked about auctions, talked

10
11

He's got lots of use for the language "proposed

use" in Section 506(a).
And -- and, in fact, if you look in his brief, he

12

doesn't offer up an explanation of what that language is

13

designed to mean.

14

amicus brief says that "proposed use" means that you're

15

supposed to use it for farmland in a Chapter 12 proceeding.

16

And it's reasonably clear to me that, to have to stretch that

17

far to find some meaning in this particular language, tells

18

you that their interpretation really eliminates the "proposed

19

use" term.

20

QUESTION:

And the only brief on their side is the one

Of course,

"proposed use" doesn't really lead
