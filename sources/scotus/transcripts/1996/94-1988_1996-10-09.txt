ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. DEMPSEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DEMPSEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The question that is raised in this case is

12

whether a particular provision in a Maine statute dealing

13

with property tax exemptions for charitable organizations

14

is or is not constitutional.

15

The challenge to the statute is laid upon the

16

commerce Clause in its dormant or negative aspect, that

17

is, without the existence of any relevant congressional

18

action under the proviso a charity that is otherwise

19

entitled to receive the exemption is denied that exemption

20

if, to use the words of the statute, it is conducted or

21

operated principally for the benefit of persons who are

22

not residents of Maine.

23

Now, the petitioner is such a charity.

24

denied the exemption on those grounds, and that really is

25

the core of the case.

It was

They're

not contested.

matter was disposed of on summary judgment below.

4

petitioner is a Maine corporation.

5

to conduct a summer camp for children in the town that is

6

now Harrison that is the respondent in this case.

7

I can summarize them quite swiftly.

The
The

Its only activity is

It is dedicated to serving Christian Science

8

families.

There are not a great many Christian Science

9

families in the State of Maine, and accordingly it

10

recruits and advertises outside the State broadly, and it

11

serves principally people, children who are not residents

12

of the State of Maine.

13

in question about 95 percent of the campers that were

14

served at the camp came to the camp from other States,

15

States other than Maine.
QUESTION:

16

Indeed, during the three tax years

Why should the taxpayers of Maine

17

subsidize charity to people outside of Maine?

18

know why they should be compelled to do that --

19

MR. DEMPSEY:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DEMPSEY:

I don't

Well, they're not --

-- by the Commerce Clause.
Surely.

The purpose, Justice

22

Scalia, which is asserted -- and let me go directly to

23

that.

24

the face of this statute is a quite reasonable purpose.

25

It is to confine the dedication of the resources of the

The purpose that is asserted to be the purpose on

1

State, of the community, to the benefit in these

2

particular areas of residence of that State.

3

Now, that purpose is as legitimate as the

4

purposes that were served in the waste disposal cases that

5

you've had before you, the purposes of encouraging private

6

industry, all the purposes that are listed in the opinion

7

of the courts in Chemical Waste, for example.

8

nothing at all sinister about the purpose.

There's

9

The question, as in almost all of these cases,

10

is whether or not the means that were adopted to achieve

11

that purpose impacted improperly upon interstate commerce.
QUESTION:

12

Do those other cases -- those other

13

cases don't involve as proximately as this one does the --

14

in effect the expenditure of State money.

15

that this -- that is, the granting of a tax deduction to

16

charities, it's just like giving charities the State

17

money.

18

those other cases involve that.

It seems to me

I don't know that those other States involve --

19

MR. DEMPSEY:

20

QUESTION:

Well --

It seems to me this is closer to the

21

situation in which the State is a market participant, and

22

the State chooses to purchase its goods only from in­

23

state companies.

24

MR. DEMPSEY:

25

QUESTION:

Well --

Which it's entitled to do.

MR. DEMPSEY:

1

Let me try to address that

2

question in the two aspects in which I understand it.

In

3

terms of its being a -- the equivalent of a tax

4

expenditure, your first point, that, as I believe you

5

yourself have indicated in your concurring opinion in the

6

West Lynn Creamery case, is true of all exemption and

7

credit cases, and the Court, as you pointed out, has

8

always regarded tax exemptions and credits as being the

9

equivalent of taxes themselves.
So that if you take a case that I think is

10
11

closely on point, the Darnell case, involving a property

12

tax again, exemption upon lumber that was produced in the

13

State that was involved, an exemption for that lumber but

14

not for others, that amounts to a tax expenditure, or, if

15

you wish, a subsidy.

16

In the Bacchus case, the exemptions that were

17

granted there to the liquors that were produced in the

18

State of Hawaii were in effect tax expenditures on behalf

19

of those people, of those manufacturers.
QUESTION:

20

Well, logically there's -- it's hard

21

to see a difference between a tax exemption and a direct

22

subsidy, isn't there?

23
24
25

MR. DEMPSEY:

That's precisely what I'm trying

to say.
QUESTION:

But you say the Court has drawn that

MR. DEMPSEY:

QUESTION:

This Court has treated them the

same.

7
8

But you say the Court has treated

them differently.

I'm sorry, Justice O'Connor.

Right.

-- based on how many Maine residents

were served by the charity.

12

MR. DEMPSEY:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DEMPSEY:

Precisely.

Would that be all right for Maine?
That's a very interesting

15

question.

Let me try to move into it more gradually, if

16

you will, and I want to come back to the market

17

participation question that Justice Scalia raised, because

18

these are really the dual, dual justifications that the

19

State advances in this case.

21

both.

Either it's like market

taken advantage of its opportunity to participate in this

proceeding, so the defense of the State statute is left to

MR. DEMPSEY:

That's because the tax goes to the

I - - yes, I'm sure that's right,

but -- in terms of fact, but the reason for the State's

10

participating at the trial court level and not appealing

11

is a matter that I am in no position to comment on at all.

12

There may be precedent for that in this Court, but I've

13

not seen a case in which a State statute has been attacked

14

as unconstitutional in which the State participated in

15

the - - at the trial court level and then abandoned the

real estate go back a pretty long way, and I thought that

2

the original -- that that thought had little to do with

3

commerce, but had to do very much with the public service

that the charity, or most traditionally the church, was

Yes.

And not some notion of worldwide

MR. DEMPSEY:

Well, I -- let me make sure that I

understand your question correctly, Justice Ginsburg.
QUESTION:

I'm asking you to - - whether this --

12

we can say real estate taxes originate -- exemptions from

13

real estate taxes - -

14

MR. DEMPSEY:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- you don't tax the church

16

property -- from something that had to do with benefiting

17

locals, and that's why we - - that's why these exemptions

18

from the real estate -- real estate doesn't move from one

19

State to another like lumber does.

20

MR. DEMPSEY:

21

QUESTION:

No.

Is there something special about real

22

estate where an exemption from the tax might be

23

supportable in that area and not in others?

24
25

MR. DEMPSEY:

Well, let me put it this way.

you were to take that view and distinguish between the

If

1

real estate and personal property taxes, for example,

2

because after all personal property does move, then you

3

would have an awkward situation here, because part of this

4

tax was personal property, and part was realty.

5

point is that that makes an awkward distinction in this

6

particular case, as it would in any case.

7

My first

My second response would be that, consider

8

Darnell.

That was a personal property tax on lumber that

9

was brought into the State from another State, the

10

exemption being given to lumber that was produced in the

11

State of Tennessee.

12

Now, if they could escape the effect of Darnell

13

simply by transforming the form of the tax, they could

14

then levy the tax on the real property, the warehouse in

15

which the lumber was stored.

16

that kind of an exception is made, it would open the door

17

to all kinds of manipulation of taxes in order to take

18

advantage of that single loophole.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DEMPSEY:

21

QUESTION:

Now, I'm suggesting that if

Not if it's limited to charity.
Now -- yes.

Before you can decide that there's

22

been discrimination against out-of-State commerce, you

23

have to decide that you're dealing with two taxpayers who

24

are similarly situated, and why isn't it entirely

25

reasonable to say that they are not similarly situated

QUESTION:

MR. DEMPSEY:

QUESTION:

Right.

Well --

Why are they similarly situated?

8

don't think you can run that argument in the normal

commercial case where all you can say is that one is an

10

outlander, the other one isn't.

MR. DEMPSEY:

QUESTION:

MR. DEMPSEY:

QUESTION:

15

I

All right --

But here one is giving something -Yes.

-- gratis to the citizens of Maine.

Why doesn't that make that taxpayer different?
MR. DEMPSEY:

16

I understand -- I understand,

17

Justice Scalia, the force of that reaction to the case.

18

Now, let me try to catch up with the strands of questions

19

that I have, because they're all related, and I don't want

20

to lose track of any one of them.
Let me go to the church support by property tax,

21
22

because that's in a way related to the very last question

23

you asked, Justice Scalia.

the market dominant, market participation and the subsidy

issue.

I suggest that if the State were here, it would be

1

very, very reluctant to make the market participation or

2

subsidy argument.

3

There are in every State -- I'm sure there are

4

statutes, exemption statutes for church property.

5

if, as the respondent argues, what the State is doing here

6

by virtue of market participation is somehow purchasing

7

camping services for the benefit of its residents, or

8

subsidizing the camps for the benefit of its residents,

9

then, by parity of reasoning, it is somehow purchasing

10

Now,

religious services from the churches.
QUESTION:

11

No, but isn't the answer to that that

12

it's purchasing a great number of other things, too, and

13

for that reason it doesn't fall afoul -- I mean, it's

14

purchasing all sorts of secular benefits on the same

15

ground for that reason it doesn't fall afoul of

16

establishment.

17

MR. DEMPSEY:

Oh, I'm sure it doesn't fall afoul

18

of establishment, Justice Souter, but the reason it

19

doesn't is because it's not market participation.

20

State, as Justice Scalia, as in the New Energy-Limbach

21

case, the State here is not purchasing anything from

anyone.

All right, well let me address --

13

but just before I forget, Justice O'Connor, on the subsidy

14

question, of course, the subsidy defense does not have the

15

same quality of imprimatur from this Court as yet as the

16

market participation test does, but as I've indicated, for

17

my purposes I'm perfectly wiling to assume, arguendo, that

until right now, and that is to suggest that there is some

2

sort of an exception for charities that is analogous to

3

the market participation, or the subsidy of that, indeed,

4

as an exception.

5

Now, the respondent abstains from making that

6

argument.

That doesn't mean that it's not a good

7

argument, but I point out that we did say at the outset

8

well, let's consider this issue, and the respondent says
no, we're not trying to draw that distinction.

10

I think myself that the respondent is correct in

11

doing that, because it seems to me it can't possibly -- or

12

shouldn't, anyway, make a difference whether you're

13

dealing with a nonprofit or a profit.

14

at that sort of primitive -- on that primitive basis.

QUESTION:

That applies only to when they're

MR. DEMPSEY:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes.

So what you have --

So we really are talking -Right.

You have --

-- just about charitable

organizations.
MR. DEMPSEY:

6

-- a protected relationship with

7

the State, nursing homes, camps, some of which are -- many

8

of which are nonprofit, but they are in competition

9

directly with these charities, so-called charities, and

10

these people lose the exemption, and they lose the

11

exemption because they serve too many people from out of

12

State.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Would a hospital lose its exemption

if it took a lot of out-of-State patients?
MR. DEMPSEY:

The hospitals are not covered by

16

this provision of the statute, Justice Stevens, and I

17

should point that out.

18

the -- now, I'm saying that without really being certain,

19

and I'm going to consult, when I sit down with my

20

colleague, Mr. Dale from -- because what we have in the

21

State of Maine, and it's not my field, goodness knows, is

22

a statutory system in which a number of different

23

categories fall under different provisions.

24
25

This proviso applies only to

So that, for example, Bates and Bowden and
Colby, who serve, certainly, more nonresidents than they

1

do residents, don't -- are not subject to this proviso

2

because that provision of the statute does not burden with

3

this proviso, so it's only this section which deals with

4

so-called benevolent and charitable organizations, a

5

catchall, but does identify with particularity some types,

6

camps, nursing homes, boarding homes, and mental health

7

treatment facilities of communities, and then whatever

8

else falls within the catchall, and I've got to get the

9

answer as to whether hospitals do or not.

10

QUESTION:

Well, at least you've given me the

11

answer for a mental institution.

12

out-of-State patients they would lose --

13

MR. DEMPSEY:

If they took too many

Mental -- community mental

14

treatment centers, so it would not be a mental hospital.

15

But take a nursing home.

16

there are private, there are profit-making nursing homes,

17

there are nonprofit nursing homes.

18

Now, nursing homes, obviously,

If you're on - - close to the border of whatever

19

State you're close to the border of and you serve more

20

than half -- now, the division as to what is principally

21

and what is not has not been made, but let's say it's more

22

than half people from the other State, you lose your

23

exemption, and you're in competition with those other

24

nonprofit nursing homes.

And that's true -18

QUESTION:

1

If it were pro rata, would you have

2

the same -- would you have a constitutional objection?

3

Suppose it said to the extent that you serve people from

4

out of State you don't get the exemption, but to the

5

extent that you serve, so in your case you could get 5

6

percent exemption because you have 5 percent from in­

7

state .
MR. DEMPSEY:

8

9

No.

My argument would be the

same, because my argument has to do, when they're getting

10

to interstate commerce, you can approach that problem in

11

different ways, as I indicate.

12

on interstate commerce because of Edwards v. California

13

and a long line of cases bringing it within the

14

affirmative and the dormant Commerce Clause interstate

15

transportation and the effect of statutes on it, but the

16

effect would be there anyway.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what is the effect, the harm

18

that you're complaining about?

19

that?
MR. DEMPSEY:

20

We focused on the impact

Yes.

Can you be precise about

Yes.

Well, what you have

21

here is a plain incentive to these organizations to limit

22

the number of nonresidents that they serve.

23

Now, they can do that in order to get the tax

24

exemption if they're close to the edge.

MR. DEMPSEY:

this will give camps like yours an incentive to take

6

people only from in the State, but it's -- your camp can't

What is the impact that you have?
All right -- but I don't want to

leave that, because I think the statute is attacked on its

18

face, and surely you must contemplate in judging the

probable impact of the statute situations in which by

Absolutely, without any question

MR. DEMPSEY:

1

In other words, we are suffering a

financial loss, and what the record does show is that part

of that is passed on to the campers and part of it

No, but if -- if the sales tax or

No, but just -- now, that point

has been made by the law court that we're not really in

Now, that argument has, it seems to me, a rather

unfortunate ring to it, but taking that -- and ignoring

that, the fact is that other camps are in the State of

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. PLOUFFE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Before addressing in detail the three arguments

6

7

in my brief which I use to support the conclusion or the

8

results achieved by the Maine law court, I want to address

9

two fundamental points which I think should be addressed

10

at the outset.
The first one is that there is no Federal

11
12

constitutional right for a nonprofit organization to

13

receive a tax exemption from local property taxes.

14

The second fundamental point is that State

15

legislatures have great latitude in deciding who should be

16

tax exempt and who should not be tax exempt.

17

especially true, I believe, when we are talking about

18

taxation from real estate tax, or exemption from real

19

estate taxes which really are a quintessentially local

20

matter.

21

This is

I would suggest to you that that discretion of

22

State legislatures extends to being able to determine what

23

benefit Maine residents in this case are to achieve -- are

24

to receive in return for this tax exemption.

They're giving this one because the State is

It's legislative discretion.

Could a legislature do it, and to the amici I would say,

legislators could choose to tax colleges and universities.

QUESTION:

That's not so scary.

I mean, the

legislatures right now, no matter how we come out on this

case, could simply eliminate the tax deduction for

subsidize, give some of the in-State tax money to those

2

Justice Burger's opinion in Walz specifically avoided

3

focusing on the secular good works that churches do as the

4

rationale for granting them an exemption.

5

He focused rather upon the history of how we

6

have treated churches and religious organizations in this

country since its founding, and before that, how England

8

treated them, and he also focused upon wanting to avoid

the entanglement between Government and the churches that

could come about.

He said, this is over some secular good works.
To get to the issue made in the --by the camps,

or the petitioner in their brief, this Court actually, I

think, dealt with the problem that is raised by the

19

Justice Rehnquist, wrote that in fact exemptions -- this

was under a case involving a 501(c) (3) exemption, and the

21

petitioner felt that they were being discriminated against

because they engaged in lobbying activities, and under

contributions to the petitioner were not tax deductible.

exemption is really the equivalent of a subsidy or even a

2

cash grant -- those are the words that were used, cash

3

grant -- and that really the Government has no obligation

4

to subsidize the First Amendment activities in that case

of the petitioner.

6

And in a footnote, the Chief Justice

7

acknowledged Walz, and did not find it to be at variance

8

with this case with Regan, where they were dealing with

clearly secular matters, so I think the Court has

addressed the problem that has been brought up by the

petitioner.

Amendment analysis, and there was dicta in WHYY, Inc. to

2

suggest -- and I admit that it is only dicta -- to suggest

3

that, had the facts been as they are here today, that may

have been okay under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Now, the petitioner raised the Fourteenth

ruled against the petitioner, so did the superior court,

It appears to be facially discriminatory against

MR. PLOUFFE:

If we choose not to use something

And the other issue about the hypothetical is

12

whether or not we are going to treat consumers as articles

13

of commerce.

14

QUESTION:

Well, nobody is arguing that you're

15

going to treat consumers as articles of commerce.

16

argument is that interstate commerce -- that is to say,

17

the movement of people back and forth, the provision of

18

services to people from out of the taxing State -- is

going to be affected.

affected.

3

MR. PLOUFFE:

And I'm suggesting that it would

4

be an indirect effect and subject to the flexible

5

approach, but I still do not read those two cases for the

6

proposition for which they want them to stand.

7

QUESTION:

How broadly do you take charities

8

outside the dormant Commerce Clause?

I know your position

9

here is that charitable exemptions, real property tax

10

exemptions shouldn't be analyzed in interstate commerce,

11

and you've given several reasons for that, but are you

12

saying that nonprofits and whatever exemptions the

3

legislature, State legislature chooses to give to them is

4

ever and always, because they're nonprofits it falls

5

outside the range of the Commerce Clause?

6

MR. PLOUFFE:

My argument goes so far as to

7

cover an exemption from income taxes, which was the case

8

in Regan, Federal income taxes, excise taxes, if they

9

would pay -- having occasion to pay them, and sales taxes.

20

We exempt them from sales taxes and income taxes and

21

property taxes in the State of Maine, and if they are

22

going to challenge the impact, how the lines are drawn by

23

the legislature in granting those exemptions, then my

argument would say - -

MR. PLOUFFE:

that it's under market

2

participation, because in each one of those cases the

3

State is asking something in return.

4

We may think that it's provincialism on the part

5

of the State of Maine to write its statute this way, but I

don't think that's the question.

or not the State legislature in Maine can do this.

QUESTION:

That's very interesting.

Does it

produce a sort of discrimination against out-of-State --

19

an out-of-State church, for example, to give a tax

20

exemption to any church that owns real estate, they're

21

exempt from the real estate tax, but if you're an out-of-

22

State church, of course, and happen to be located in a

23

State that taxes church real estate, you're at a

commercial disadvantage, I suppose, if you consider the

attracting of parishioners as commerce.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. DEMPSEY

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

Thank you, Mr. Plouffe.

MR. DEMPSEY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I

just have two comments.

9

The -- one of the questions that Justice Scalia

20

raised in terms of how old this statute is raises another

21

question, and also your last question about property

22

taxes, and that is, why hasn't this Court ever seen a case

23

like this before, and the short answer is that

24

legislatures have not passed statutes like this before.

25

Now, there have been scores, thousands of

1

statutes that we don't know anything about, but we have

2

examined, and the respondent has, the statutes on the

3

books.

4

that can be considered comparable.

5

turned up three more.

6

We have discovered one in the State of Michigan
The respondent has

We deny that they're comparable.

But in any case, if this statute is not

7

absolutely unique, it is almost unique, and that says

8

something, because the policy of the Commerce Clause

9

doesn't have to do just with economics, it has to do with

10

interstate comity, and we suggest that this unbroken,

11

almost unbroken pattern of behavior by the legislatures

12

says something about how the States feel to meet the

13

demands of interstate comity.

14

Now, the last point is Justice Connor's comment

15

and Justice Scalia's comment, I hope it goes without

16

saying, because I didn't say it, that our case is rooted

17

in the basic premise that this statute is facially

18

discriminatory against interstate commerce.

19

Justice Scalia, I think you're absolutely -- I

20

started with this notion in the petition of certiorari.

21

If you apply all the ordinary canons that this Court has

22

established over the years dealing with these cases, the

23

other side has got to lose, in my judgment.

24

out is to create an exception for -- I wouldn't say

25

charities, nonprofit organizations comparable to the
