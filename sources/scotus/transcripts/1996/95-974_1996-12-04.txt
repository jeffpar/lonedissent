CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

We'll hear argument

4

now in Number 95-974, Arizonans for Official English and

5

Robert D. Park v. Arizona.
Mr. Zall, and let me request of you, Mr. Zall,

6

7

and also of your colleague that the Court is very

8

interested in hearing a full discussion of the issues

9

relating to standing, mootness, and jurisdiction, so we

10

hope you'll devote a substantial part of your arguments to

11

that.
MR. ZALL:

12

Yes, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARNABY W. ZALL

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ZALL:

15
16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

17

This First Amendment facial overbreadth case

18

involves a Government employee who wanted to write her

19

official documents in a language her supervisor did not

20

understand.
Even if her choice of language on the job was

21

22

speech, which is was not, it was the Government's speech,

23

not hers.

24

of a First Amendment violation when it restrains its own

25

speech.

Under Capital Square, Government runs no risk

Official English statutes, which are simply

1

restraints on the Government's own speech, do not violate

2

the First Amendment.

It's a political choice.

One point was not treated sufficiently in the

3
4

briefs.

5

Government contractors case, the Court said that the

6

Government's interest in speech depends on the speaker's

7

proximity to Government.

8

greater the Government's interest.

9

Last term in County Commissioners v. Umbehr, a

The closer to Government, the

Umbehr described a speech spectrum ranging from

10

private citizens, in whose speech the Government has

11

little interest, to Government employees, whose closeness

12

to Government means that the Government is very interested

13

in their speech.

14

Government contractors fell somewhere in between

15

Government employees, who had the closest relationship to

16

Government, and other speakers with less close

17

relationships, and though not said in Umbehr, since

18

Government is actually closest to itself, Government

19

speech, the Government speech cases would be -- would

20

place very high on the Umbehr speech spectrum, beyond --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Zall, this particular Government,

22

at least the Attorney General, long before this case was

23

decided by the district court said that the constitutional

24

provision in Arizona did not prohibit the use of a

25

language other than English where necessary to assure the

fairness and effectiveness of the delivery of services to

2

members of the public.

3

controversy?

4

Why didn't that end this

The then plaintiff, the sole plaintiff in effect

5

got all the relief that she sought, which was the

6

assurance that she wouldn't be fired if she used a

7

language other than English where necessary to assure the

8

fair delivery of her service.

9

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, we agree with the

10

Attorney General's opinion as to its construction of

11

Article XXVIII on the First Amendment grounds.

12

agree that the Attorney General appropriately considered

13

equal protection matters.

14

Attorney General's opinion relied on a case which,

15

subsequent to the opinion, this court vacated on mootness,

16

and that was an equal protection issue.

17

QUESTION:

We also

Our concern is that the

Did the Attorney General withdraw

18

that opinion as the official interpretation of the State's

19

executive?

20

MR. ZALL:

It did not, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

So that's the law as far as the

22

executive's -- as far as official Government in Arizona is

23

concerned, so my question is, why didn't this case end?

24

Wasn't it moot at that point?

25

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, I believe the plaintiffs

1

in the case said that the next Attorney General could

2

issue another opinion and the Attorney General's opinion

3

was not binding on the courts, therefore they felt that

4

they still had a viable case, and the district court

5

disagreed with the Attorney General's interpretation and

6

decided not to abide by it, as did the Ninth Circuit.

7

QUESTION:

Well, is -- it's not a question of

8

what the district court independently might think the law

9

was.

The question was, was the plaintiff at any risk of

10

losing her job when the official interpretation, the

11

State's interpretation, was that what she was doing was

12

all right?

13
14
15
16
17

MR. ZALL:

I think the answer to that question

is she was at no risk of losing her job, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't -- what controversy was

left, then, if she was at no risk of losing her job?
MR. ZALL:

I believe, Your Honor, that although

18

that was -- that's the correct interpretation, she did not

19

agree with that and asked the court on a slightly

20

different ground, which is that she was not -- excuse me.

21

The district court handed down a decision on a

22

slightly different ground, which is that although she was

23

not at risk from losing her job, it decided this was a

24

facial overbreadth case and felt somehow there were some

25

risk to other Government employees who were not before the

1

court.
QUESTION:

2

What basis would there have been for

3

that?

I mean, the Attorney General's statement of State

4

law was not a statement which was peculiar to her.

5

MR. ZALL:

I think that's correct, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION:

So the district court was wrong,

MR. ZALL:

I believe the district court was

7

wasn't it?

8

9
10

wrong, Your Honor.

This never should have been a facial

overbreadth -QUESTION:

11

So at that point the case was

12

certainly moot, even if we make the assumption that there

13

was a case or controversy at some point.
QUESTION:

14

And it probably became moot when

15

Ms. Yniguez left her State employment, I would have

16

thought, at the very least.

17

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, the central point of

\

18

mootness is whether this Court's decision can affect the

19

legal rights of the parties before it.

QUESTION:

in this case at this juncture?
MR. ZALL:

3

Petitioners have standing because the

4

lower court decisions affected their legal rights.

have legal rights created by the State.
QUESTION:

What kind of rights does your

organization have, AOC, or whatever it is?

MR. ZALL:

AOE --

9

QUESTION:

You assume that it's some kind of

10

legislative standing for them?

11

for that would give them standing?
MR. ZALL:

12
13

•

And how is it that they have standing

What is it you're arguing

In footnote 17 of Diamond v. Charles

the Court noted that a State may create interest the
invasion of which would give standing in Federal court.

14

15

That's exactly what we have here.

17

The State created an

I would have thought Diamond v.

18

Charles would require us to say that the organization does

19

not have legislative standing.

20

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, Diamond v. Charles as I

21

read it is predicated on the ability to create and enact a

22

legally enforceable code, citing Snapp.

23

QUESTION:

But how does that give the

24

organization here standing, Arizonans for Official

25

English?

QUESTION:

There are two

Well, once the thing is adopted by

6

the voters, I don't see what standing that organization

has to litigate in Federal court.
QUESTION:

8

10

Along that same line, how is your

organization any different from any citizen in the State
of Arizona?
MR. ZALL:

11

Your Honor, the statute -- the

12

citizens' suit provision in Article XXVIII, section 4

13

permits any person or organization doing business in

14

Arizona to enforce Article XXVIII in State court.

15

would not, in and of itself, give standing.

QUESTION:

State law cause of action?

It is a State --

QUESTION:

I mean, how do you get to Federal

MR. ZALL:

Because the Federal court decision

eliminated that State court right.

equivalent of our having any other State interest, State

QUESTION:

3

seems to me that you're agreeing that you're no different

than any other citizen of the State of Arizona.

QUESTION:

Would a Senator who sponsors a bill

have standing to challenge a court's evisceration of the

17

bill after it's been adopted as a statute --

MR. ZALL:

The Senator --

-- on the ground that he's -- you

know, it's my bill.

MR. ZALL:

It was my idea.
No, Your Honor, the Senator alone

probably not, but the legislative body itself would under

statute has standing to challenge the court's

interpretation of it?
MR. ZALL:

3
4

What Chadha says is, where the executive branch and the

5

challenger both agree that the provision is

6

unconstitutional, Congress was the appropriate body to

7

defend the statute.

8

QUESTION:

9

•

Well, but Congress is a standing

branch of the Government with ongoing duties and

10

responsibilities, and it was vitally interested in the

11

one-House veto from the standpoint of its institutional

12

capacity.

13

the ballot.

All your organization did was put something on

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, the same situation

15

applies in Arizona, where the Arizona constitution,

16

Article IV, provides that the voters themselves have the

17

right to an initiative, and this is a matter in which this

18

would affect the voters' right of initiative.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. --

20

QUESTION:

Is your claim -- I'm sorry.

21

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

22

QUESTION:

Are you claiming that the Arizona

I had one.

23

provision therefore creates Article III standing for any

24

Arizona citizen in a Federal court?

•

Not quite at that point, Your Honor.

MR. ZALL:

No, Your Honor.

I'm suggesting that

1

in certain limited circumstances the invasion of the right

2

would give someone standing to complain about it, and the

3

difference is --

4

QUESTION:

But what is the invasion of the right

5

which would be in any way different from an invasion which

6

any citizen simply as a citizen could claim?

7

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, the invasion of the right

8

is the elimination of the right.

9

question, the prudential question.

10

QUESTION:

That goes to the injury

Well, in -- then I think what you're

11

saying is that any citizen could have Article -- would

12

have Article III standing.

13

MR. ZALL:

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

14

because the individual interest -- t he individual injury

15

to each citizen is so small relative to everyone else that

16

there is no differentiation, but to the initiative

17

proponent, just as in this Court's decision in the Term

18

Limits case, where the State was present, just as the

19

State is present here, the initiative proponents were able

20

to come forward and make their best case.

21

QUESTION:

Because the State was present making

22

the argument on the merits, but here we don't have that.

23

I think the State is telling us this case is moot, right?

MR. ZALL:

position, but lower -- in the lower courts they were quite

It's only when

they came to this Court that they brought up once again

QUESTION:

Yes, but this Court is bound by a

5

case or controversy requirement, and the State is

6

acknowledging that that no longer exists.

7

You did say one thing, Mr. Zall, that puzzled

8

me, and perhaps I misunderstood you.

You said that you

9

were now disabled because the Federal court had eliminated

10

your right, but it was not my understanding that a

11

district court or a court of appeals is a higher authority

12

on a question of Federal constitutional law than, say, the

13

supreme court of Arizona.

•

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, I'm sure that's true as

15

to the interpretation of State law, but not necessarily

16

the application of Federal law to State law, but leaving

17

that aside --

18

QUESTION:

Do you think -- is the -- are the

19

Arizona State courts bound by what the Ninth Circuit

20

thinks Federal constitutional law is?

21

MR. ZALL:

I think the courts are split on that,

Your Honor.

23

not bound, but there are cases --

And you didn't seek to enter the

litigation before the judgment in the district court.

14

MR. ZALL:

That's correct.

And was the reason that you didn't

Your Honor, if we have no standing,

11

and the argument is that the district court's opinion

12

stands, then you will have in essence private

13

constitutional review.

14

QUESTION:

Well, under our Bankcorp decision it

15

seems to me that even though we were to conclude you have

16

no standing, that does not mean we would simply dismiss

17

the petition for certiorari if we find that there was a

18

defect further below, that there was -- either controversy

19

either had become moot, or there was no case or

20

controversy in the first place.

This Court would then have the authority to
vacate the opinions below, I believe.
MR. ZALL:

the States in its briefs, Your Honor.

That is to say, I can see if you were the only

There was no

But in the district court, prior to Ms. Yniguez

leaving her job, the district court reached its decision

and then the other party to the case, the Governor,

decided not to appeal, so there was no appeal, and

MR. ZALL:

As to whether there was ever a

Yes, because that would seem to be

determinative, wouldn't it, about whether or not we

vacated, assuming you lose all the other points, the

8

district court decision or just vacated the court of

important on that.
And of course if you left that in place you

12

could review the matter in some other case.

you're not deprived of constitutional review.

QUESTION:

I mean,

Was there ever a point when the

15

Governor was adverse to the plaintiff in this case, and

16

there was one statement that the Governor said that she

17

would comply with the constitutional amendment, and she

expected every other State official to do the same.

opinion said, in essence, there's no --

QUESTION:

So at that point where was the

controversy?
MR. ZALL:

Since this is a First Amendment case,

speech, and because the --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. POHLMAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

5

7

MR. POHLMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When the State of Arizona determined in its

8

exercise of it sovereign judgment that it would not join

9

in the petition for certiorari in this case and that it

10

would not appeal the final judgment in Ms. Yniguez' favor

11

for nominal damages in the district court, this case

12

became one without an Article III case for controversy and

13

should have concluded.

14

We would ask that this Court dismiss the

15

petition because the petitioners lack standing to maintain

16

this action in this Court.

17

QUESTION:

I certainly agree with that, but why

18

didn't it suddenly become nonexistent as soon as the

19

district court entered a judgment that didn't include

20

nominal damages and the petitioner later, and before the

21

appeal, resigned from her State employment?

22

become moot then?

23

MR. POHLMAN:

Why didn't it

It wasn't moot for a number of

24

reasons, Justice Scalia, one of which is that there was a

against Governor Mofford, so that judgment was binding and

2

final long before she left State employment.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, why was there a case or

controversy in the district court, please?

5

MR. POHLMAN:

In the district court there was a

6

case or controversy initially because, as a factual

7

matter, the district court found that Ms. Yniguez had

8

suffered an injury in fact in that she -- her First

9

Amendment rights had been chilled.
QUESTION:

10
11

Well, the Government -- the Governor

agreed that the proposition was invalid.
MR. POHLMAN:

12

The Governor agreed after the

13

judgment, Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, that it was

14

invalid.

15

QUESTION:

Well, there was never -- there was

16

never an answer on the merits, was there?

QUESTION:

1

But at any point in the litigation

2

did either the Governor or the Attorney General indicate

3

that your client would be disciplined for using Spanish?
MR. POHLMAN:

4

There was -- Justice Kennedy,

5

there was no specific indication.

However, there was a

6

finding that Governor Mofford intended to enforce the

7

article, that she expected Government employees to enforce

8

the article and to comply with the article, and that

9

therefore Ms. Yniguez had a chilling effect on her First

10

Amendment rights that was caused by Governor Mofford, and

11

that's found in the appendix to the petition for

12

certiorari at pages 102 and 103.

13

QUESTION:

What was the basis for that finding?

14

MR. POHLMAN:

It was Governor Mofford's

15

outspoken indication that she intended to enforce Article

16

XXVIII, and that she expected Government employees to

17

comply.

18

QUESTION:

But in view of the Attorney General's

19

opinion, enforcement of it does not seem to have a

20

realistic prospect of any effect on Ms. Yniguez.

21

MR. POHLMAN:

First, Mr. Chief Justice, Ms.

22

Yniguez did not have the benefit of that particular

23

Attorney General's opinion until some 3-1/2 months after

24

this litigation was commenced, so for that 3-1/2 month

25

period of time, her rights were obviously chilled.

QUESTION:

So that leaves the Governor, and

isn't it also the case that prior to the district court

reasonable way.

Isn't that correct?

MR. POHLMAN:

that is your view, how can, at least with respect to the

MR. POHLMAN:

Justice Ginsburg,

I think what we

19

do is, we look at the Bonner Mall Partnership case, and we

20

find that vacatur is an equitable doctrine.

21

If we look at the equities as to what occurred

Governor.

Partnership.
But if you look at the equities with respect to

3

the Ninth Circuit, at the time that that judgment was

4

entered, Mr. Zall's group and the Attorney General sought

5

to intervene for purposes of taking an appeal of the

6

judgment at that time.

7

Ms. Yniguez had no reason at that juncture to

8

appeal her claim for nominal damages because the district

9

court said we will not allow this judgment to be appealed.

10

No one has an interest to appeal it.

11

right here.

12

It is going to stop

And so all that was on appeal --

QUESTION:

Well, how can a district court

13

prevent someone from appealing?

14

of appeals could say there is no interest, but what did

15

the district -- did the district court enter some sort of

16

an order that they couldn't appeal?

17

MR. POHLMAN:

I can see how the court

No, Your Honor.

What the district

18

court did was to deny the motions of Mr. Zall's group,

19

Arizonans for Official English, and the Attorney General,

20

to intervene for the purpose of taking an appeal.

21

QUESTION:

What you're saying is no one who

22

wasthen in the lawsuit was interested in appealing.

23

MR. POHLMAN:

7

MR. POHLMAN:

8

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

That is exactly --

And the first thing that the court of

appeals did was to reverse that denial as to AOE, right?

10

MR. POHLMAN:

11

QUESTION:

That is correct.

And then what the district -- what

12

the court of appeals did concerning the Attorney General

I'm not altogether clear.

15

MR. POHLMAN:

Was the Attorney General, in

I -- yes and no, and the reason I

16

answer it that way, Justice Ginsburg, is because they were

17

permitted to intervene under -- and I would share Mr.

18

Zall's view that it's kind of a bizarre application of 28

19

U.S.C. 2403(b), but the Attorney General is permitted to

20

intervene for the purpose of arguing the constitutionality

21

of the amendment.

22

That statute provides that the Attorney General

23

may do so or the State may do so and has all the rights

24

and obligations of a party, but they're not exactly a

25

party, although they have all rights and obligations,

QUESTION:

But the State's position, as I

understand it, is that the case became moot when the

plaintiff left the State's employ, and that happened

before the Ninth Circuit's judgment.

time that if it goes back, and if there ever is an appeal

MR. POHLMAN:

QUESTION:

For purposes of damages?

Yes.
I think --

So how could the district court ever,

under a 1983 suit, assess even nominal damages against the

State?

7

MR. POHLMAN:

Itfs my understanding that under

8

the Ex parte Young doctrine there can be an award of

9

nominal damages, and I don't have the case before me.

I

10

would be happy to submit a letter brief, Justice O'Connor,

11

if that would assist the Court, but in any event what

12

occurred was the nominal damages were awarded in the face

13

of an express waiver of immunity by the State of Arizona.

QUESTION:

Where do we find that express waiver

in the record?
MR. POHLMAN:

I gather that

That's quite accurate.

Now, if that's so, the State's

MR. POHLMAN:

had they been granted leave to intervene.

You recognized the standing

Exactly.

Well, if that's the case, then, then

the Attorney General was not in only on the limited basis

10

that my suggestion gave him, so I suppose if you accept

11

his standing as a party at that point, and you take the

12

position that he should have been allowed in, period, then

13

I guess -the argument for vacating is a valid argument.

14
14

MR. POHLMAN:

Justice Souter, we would disagree

15

with that for some of the reasons that have been said

16

before, but in fact, and this goes back again to the

17

ruling by the Ninth Circuit with regard to 2403(b), in

18

fact you're entitled to intervene as the State, not as a

19

party, but with all the rights and obligations of a party

20

at that point in time, and the district court recognized

21

there is no right to intervene at that point, or at least

22

felt that way.

23

The Ninth Circuit gave them a right which is not

24

contemplated by the statute, which was a defendant

25

standing under 2403(b), and I -- and for purposes of your

that was the understanding the State had, that they were

in there with defendants --

Ah, so that's why they're stuck.

QUESTION:

Could -- I have two questions briefly

Yes, okay.

11

that I'd like to hear your answer to.

12

is, I'd like to hear clearly what your answer was to

13

Justice O'Connor's initial question.

14

The most important

I take it in the district: court there was a

15

person, the plaintiff, and a defendant, the Governor, who

16

had an argument.

17

didn't appeal.

18

ever a controversy between them, and the answer to that

19

depends upon whether there was a reasonable threat of

20

prosecution, isn't that right?

21

in support of that.

The plaintiff won, and the Governor
All right, but the question was, was there

MR. POHLMAN:

QUESTION:

That's the case they cited

Now, you pointed to a place in the

district court's opinion which says I, the district judge,

25

think there was a reasonable threat of prosecution.

in the record do I find the material upon which that

2

conclusion rests?

3

MR. POHLMAN:

You will find the testimony in our

4

appendix attached to our brief on the merits at pages 14

5

and 15, which is the testimony of Ms. Yniguez concerning

6

her fear that she may be prosecuted, or that there may be

7

a citizens suit based upon the test of Article XXVIII.

8

You will find the judge's conclusion on page

9

102a of the appendix to the petition for certiorari, where

10

he finds that in fact Ms. Yniguez has suffered an injury

11

in fact due to the threat of potential disciplinary action

12

by virtue of --

13

QUESTION:

Was Ms. Yniguez --- excuse me.

14

QUESTION:

Where do I find what the Governor

15

said, because what he's saying is it's the Governor's

16

statement that leads me to think that the Governor might

17

prosecute her.

18

MR. POHLMAN:

That is in the stipulated facts

19

that are in the joint appendix, I believe.

20

may be in our appendix beginning at pages 5 and 6.

don't have that right in front of me, but I can find that

MR. POHLMAN:

2

The cross-appeal for the denial of

nominal damages occurred shortly after the first appeal on

the merits was ever filed by any intervenor, and that was

after the case had been remanded, following the decision

The original appeal to the Ninth Circuit went up

MR. POHLMAN:

The original appeal was not on the

merits, Justice Scalia.

15

QUESTION:

I understand.

MR. POHLMAN:

That's why the cross-appeal we are

Well, but the question is, did the

MR. POHLMAN:

what the district court found, that she had a reasonable

MR. ZALL:

I'd like to point the Court's

attention to the rulings of the two lower courts on this

case.

22

In the petition appendix, page 112, 113a, the

23

order of the district court says, it is further ordered

that Article XXVIII of the constitution of the State of

2

Constitution of the United States.

3

And on page 60a of the same appendix, the Ninth

4

Circuit en banc decision says, we affirm the district

5

court's judgment that Article XXVIII of the Arizona

6

constitution is facially overbroad and violates the First

7

Amendment, and that the article is unconstitutional in its

8

entirety.

10

I think that is the heart of the matter here,
Your Honors,
Petitioners are bound by the lower court

13

XXVIII is void in its entirety, then petitioners do not

14

have the enforcement rights that the court suggests that

15

they do.

If Article

In addition, on the question of who defends the

17

actions, I think in this case the Attorney General

18

attempted to defend, and because of the application of

2403(b) in this case the Attorney General and the State's

rights under the Eleventh Amendment were implicated

QUESTION:

General is enlightened and understands that long before

moot, so if we accept that, that wipes out the Ninth

2

Circuit's decision, because the Ninth Circuit has no

3

authority to issue a judgment in a moot case.

4
5

MR. ZALL:

It would also wipe out the district

court opinion.
QUESTION:

6

Not necessarily, because if the

7

mootness occurred on appeal, you don't ordinarily wipe out

8

a final judgment from which no party to that judgment has

9

appealed.

10

If we had a lawsuit with two parties at the end

11

of the road, neither pursued an appeal in the district

12

court, and then we have quite different lawsuit in the

13

Ninth Circuit-and. the State is telling us as to that

14

lawsuit mootness occurred before the judgment, how do you

15

reach back and say, but the mootness also affects the

16

original suit and that original judgment between the

17

plaintiff and the Governor?

18

MR. ZALL:

Your Honor, the problem with the

19

hypothetical is that this is not a standard contract case

20

or an employment problem case.

QUESTION:

But you can't rely on a judgment

that's vacated, and the Federal court has no authority to

time judgment was entered.
MR. ZALL:

But, Your Honor, the problem is, if

7

we go into State court and say, sue anyone in the State,

the defense by everyone is, the distx'ict court for Arizona

9

has held this statute -- this constitutional provision

10

unconstitutional in its entirety.
QUESTION:

11

It was my understanding that a

district court's judgment doesn't necessarily bind even

13

another district judge in the same district.

MR. ZALL:

But it does --

QUESTION:

So how does it bind a State court?

16

MR. ZALL:

It doesn't bind it in the sense that
