ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Information is the lifeblood of the securities

12

markets.

13

analyze, and use information, but the deceptive

14

acquisition and use of information in securities trading

15

serves no legitimate purpose.

16

trading involved just such deception.

Markets thrive on legitimate efforts to acquire,

Respondent's securities

Respondent is a lawyer whose firm was entrusted

18

with the confidential plans of a client that had planned

19

to make a tender offer for the Pillsbury company.

20

posing as a loyal partner in his law firm, respondent

21

misappropriated that information in breach of his

22

fiduciary duties to the firm and his client and reaped

23

personal profits in virtually risk-free trading in

24

Pillsbury stock and options.

While

connection with his trading, respondent violated three

2

prohibitions of Federal law:

3

Securities Exchange Act, section 14(e) of the Exchange

4

Act, and the mail fraud statute.

section 10(b) of the

Now, the misappropriation theory under section

5
6

10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act posits that a

7

fiduciary or other person with a similar relationship of

8

trust and confidence commits deception on the legitimate

9

owner of information if that fiduciary or other agent

10

misappropriates the information by using it in securities

11

trading, contrary to the view of the United States Court

12

of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, just by

14

misappropriating?

15

instead come clean, and he told his superiors in the law

16

firm that he was going to use this information.

17

would not be posing as a loyal employee any more, and it

18

would have been okay.

19

I mean, suppose the defendant here had

MR. DREEBEN:

He would not have deceived his

20

employer.

21

fiduciary duties that he owed to that employer.

He still would have breached independent

QUESTION:

23

breached the securities laws.

So that's the line.

He didn't tell

them that he was going to go out and use it.

MR. DREEBEN:

That's absolutely correct, and the

4

reason why that is significant is that section

prohibits deceptive devices and contrivances.

6

deception.

7

0(b)
It requires

The misappropriation theory does involve a

8

breach of fiduciary duty, but the distinctive factor about

9

that breach is that it is a deceptive breach.

It

10

involves, just as the facts did in Carpenter v. United

11

States, an agent entrusted with information by a principal

12

under the understanding between the parties that the agent

3

would not use that information for any personal gain

4

without obtaining the principal's agreement.

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Dreeben, then if someone

6

stole the lawyer's briefcase and discovered the

7

information and traded on it, no violation?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

And if a partner perhaps in the law

20

firm, the lawyer let his daughter know about the planned

21

merger inadvertently and the daughter relied on the

22

information and bought stock options, violation?

23

daughter has no obligation to disclose.

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, Justice O'Connor, and the

answer to that is probably not, although there has been

1

litigation about whether in particular circumstances a

2

family relationship is sufficiently imbued with a business

3

context that there is a duty that runs to it, but I accept

4

the general thrust of your hypotheticals.

5

There are forms of improper conduct that section

6

10(b) does not reach, and the reason why section 10(b)

7

does not reach them is it is a statute that is framed to

8

reach fraudulent deceptive activity in connection with

9

securities trading.

10

QUESTION:

That is -Well, Mr. Dreeben, where is -- the

11

thing that bothers me about the case here is, where is the

12

connection between the deceptive device and the purchase

13

or sale of a security?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

The connection, Chief Justice

15

Rehnquist, lies in the fact that the misappropriation does

16

not occur until the lawyer uses the information as the

17

basis for his trades.

18

drives his participation in the market and allows the

19

profits to be reached -- reaped by him.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

It is that very information which

But he didn't deceive anyone who sold

him securities.
MR. DREEBEN:

That is true.

The

23

misappropriation theory doesn't rely on the notion that he

24

owed a duty of disclosure to the shareholders on the other

25

side of the transaction, but it does satisfy the requisite

connection between the fraud and the securities trading,

2

because it is only in the trading that the fraud is

3

consummated.

4
5

There could be no closer --

QUESTION:

But you think of fraud being

practiced on a person who is damaged by it.
MR. DREEBEN:

6

I think that under the common law

7

view of fraud, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is an

8

accurate statement, but the securities laws are not framed

9

to pick up only those violations that are covered by

10

common law fraud.

Congress did not pass a statute that

11

says, it is unlawful to commit fraud on the purchaser or

12

seller of securities.
Congress did not pass a law even that said it is

13
14

unlawful to commit fraud in a securities transaction.

15

passed a law with a broader phrase, in connection with a

16

securities transaction, because the very aim of this

17

section was to pick up unforeseen, cunning, deceptive

18

devices that people might cleverly use in the securities

19

markets --

21

22

QUESTION:

It

That's rather unusual, for a criminal

statute to be that open-ended, isn't it?
MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think that it's unusual to

23

give the text of this statute its natural reading.

24

it requires is proof of fraud, and then it requires proof

25

that there's a connection between the fraud and the

In this case, as I've said, there could be no

What if Grand Met had its own

strategy to purchase shares for some reason to make the

price go up temporarily?

8

Met's interest, and yet all the facts were the same.

I don't know quite how the

10

helping its grand scheme.

If he didn't deceive anyone by

doing this, he would not --

3

QUESTION:

What if he didn't tell the client.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, then the client would be

5

deceived.

Whoever does not know about this and has not

6

authorized it is a victim of the fraud, just as in the

7

Carpenter case, if Weinans had gone to the Wall Street

8

Journal and said, look, you know, you're not paying me

9

very much.

I'd like to make a little bit more money by

10

buying stock, the stocks that are going to appear in my

Heard on the Street column, and the Wall Street Journal

12

said, that's fine, there would have been no deception of

It's the

2

information itself, which Grand Met has a right to

3

determine how it would be used.
It has a right to maintain its exclusive right

4
5

to use the information and not to have the agents, upon

6

whom it must rely if it's going to engage in any kind of

7

business activity, misappropriate that information for

8

personal gain, and I think it's a very well-settled

9

concept of the common law and of the law of fraud that

10

information is a species of property, so that -QUESTION:

11
12

Mr. -- I'm sorry.

I didn't mean to

interrupt.
MR. DREEBEN:

13

So the deceptive conduct here is,

14

in essence, indistinguishable from the deceptive conduct

15

that the Court found in the Carpenter case.
QUESTION:

16

Do you take the position that every

relationship of trust also implies the duty to disclose if

the trust is to be breached?

relationship.
QUESTION:

Well, but so does a -- I suppose a

3

lawyer in a trust relationship with his client in the

4

handling of funds, and yet if a lawyer -- I presume that

5

if a lawyer disclosed to his client that he was going to

6

commingle, or he was going to borrow, as it were, the

7

client's funds for personal reasons, that that would not

8

be a defense either to a professional or a statutory

9

charge against him.

10

Perhaps I'm wrong there, but I assumed it would

11

not, so I'm not sure why, then, number 1 there is a

12

disclosure obligation here, whereas a disclosure

13

obligation there would be of no point --

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

QUESTION:

16

the other wouldn't.

17

The --

-- and the one would be a defense and

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Souter, the reason why it

18

makes a difference is that the disclosure obligation is a

19

prerequisite to obtaining the consent of the principal or

20

the owner of the trust.

21

QUESTION:

But I thought -- maybe I

22

misunderstood your answer earlier.

I thought that if

23

there were a disclosure but no consent that would in

24

effect preclude liability.

You're saying there must be a

MR. DREEBEN:

1

To satisfy the common law rule

2

that a trustee may not use the property that's been

3

entrusted with him, there would have to be consent.

4

satisfy the requirement of the Securities Act that there

5

be no deception, there would only have to be disclosure.

Yes, that's what I thought, too.
That's correct.

And -- but there would be in that

case other sanctions immediately.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

That's correct.

If you told the law firm, look, I'm

14

going to do this, the law firm isn't going to consent but

15

it's not likely he'll retain his job, and there might be

16

other sanctions.

MR. DREEBEN:

In that case it's not 10 (b)5.
It'S not 10(b)5.

It would Still

21

be a breach of fiduciary duty, but that makes the point

22

that I'm trying to make here.

23

fiduciary duty involves deception, but a breach of

24

fiduciary duty when that breach involves the obligation to

25

make disclosure does involve deception.

Not every breach of

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

That, in fact, is

1

the foundation of this Court's rulings in Chiarella and

2

Dirks that an insider in a corporation has a duty to his

3

shareholders to make disclosure before trading with them.

4

QUESTION:

There's one thing that I'm still not

5

clear on, and that is, what is it that is peculiar about

6

some breaches of trust, or some obligations of trust, that

7

raise the disclosure obligation whereas others do not have

8

a disclosure obligation that would at all be relevant?

9

MR. DREEBEN:

The answer, Justice Souter, is

10

that there are some things that a trustee cannot do even

11

if he does disclose them.

12

fiduciary duty, but there are some breaches of fiduciary

3

duty that inherently require a breach of the duty to make

4

disclosure.

5
6
7

QUESTION:

They will still be breaches of

You rely on disclosure as just a

reverse mechanism for defining deception.
MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

I think that it's clear

8

under this Court's decisions in Chiarella and Dirks that

9

generally silence is not fraudulent in conducting a

20

transaction, but it becomes fraudulent if there is a duty

21

to make disclosure, and the Court in the Chiarella and

22

Dirks cases looked to well-settled understandings which it

23

then believed were incorporated into

24

disclosure is required.

does it say that the essence of deception is

2

nondisclosure?

3

suppose.

4

That's what you're asking us to write, I

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not asking the Court to do

5

anything more than to reaffirm the basic principle that it

6

adopted in Carpenter v. United States that an agent who

7

misappropriates his principal's property by posing as a

8

loyal employee when in fact he's reaping personal gain

9

with that property has committed a form of deception,

10

indeed, a form of fraud, and that fraud satisfies both the

11

mail fraud statute and it satisfies section
QUESTION:

12

0(b).

May I ask you one question, Mr.

3

Dreeben?

4

if I understood you correctly, that if the defendant here

5

had disclosed to his partners, that would have avoided

6

liability, and you're suggesting there was therefore no

7

duty to disclose to the client.

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

disclose to the client as well.

20
21

I'm a little puzzled by your statement that --

No, I think there is a duty to
I think that there are

two victims, direct victims of the deception.
QUESTION:

But supposing in this case he had

disclosed to his partner, and his partner had just kept

the information to himself, and then he had gone -- the

defendant had gone ahead with his trading.

1

Yes, there would, but we would not

have been able to charge it the same way as we charged

this case.

4

6

QUESTION:

I see.

You then would have said

there was a breach of the firm's duty to the client.
MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

In this case, the

7

jury was instructed that it could rely on a finding of a

8

breach of duty either to the law firm or to the client or

9

to both, and it had to be unanimous about which one it

10

found, but it had to find one or the other, or it could

11

find both, and if there was disclosure, the party that

12

received the disclosure would not be a victim of the fraud

13

on our theory.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben --

15

QUESTION:

Now, Mr. Dreeben, we -- this Court

16

has always required either a misrepresentation or an

17

omission to find 10(b) liability, I think, and you say

18

there was an omission here by the failure to disclose.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, and I say that there is an

20

omission by the failure to disclose in exactly the same

21

way as there was in Carpenter.

22

Court has never ruled out what seems commonsensical under

23

10(b), the idea that the conduct itself, even without a

24

statement or an omission, can be deceptive.

I also believe that the

2

engaging his partners in discussions about firm business,

3

under the understanding that he was doing this in the

interests of the firm, when in fact, as the jury

then.

Well, any, any fraud is deception,

I assume that, you know, if a lawyer takes the

10

client's money that's supposed to be in a trust account

11

and just removes it posing as an honest lawyer, I mean,

12

you know, everybody who commits any fraud is guilty of

3
4

deception.

Isn't that right?
MR. DREEBEN:

Scalia, and the Court said --

QUESTION:

23

The fact --

I do not think that you have.

Why not?

Isn't that in connection

with the purchase of security just as much as this one is?
MR. DREEBEN:

It's not just as much as this one

24

is, because in this case it is the use of the information

25

that enables the profits, pure and simple.

The difference --

7

MR. DREEBEN:

The difference, Justice Scalia, is

8

that once you have the money you can do anything you want

9

with it.

In a sense, the fraud is complete at that point,

10

and then you go on and you can use the money to finance

11

any number of other activities, but the connection is far

12

less close than in this case, where the only value of this

information for personal profit for respondent was to take

it and profit in the securities markets by trading on it.

MR. DREEBEN:

That's exactly right, and because

3

of that difference, three can be no doubt that this kind

4

of misappropriation of property is in connection with the

5

purchase or sale of securities.

6

Other kinds of misappropriation of property may

7

or may not, but this is a unique form of fraud, unique to

8

the securities markets, in fact, because the only way in

9

which respondent could have profited through this

information is by either trading on it or by tipping

11

somebody else to enable their trades.

Let me ask you whether you think

7

section 14(e) provides you with an easier argument for

8

liability than 10(b).
MR. DREEBEN:

9

Well, I certainly think that 14(e)

10

provides us with a perfectly valid argument for liability.

11

The theory under section 14 is that Congress specifically

12

gave the Commission regulatory authority in the area of

13

tender offers because it recognized that tender offers

14

pose a very significant threat to investors in the target

15

company having the ability to make decisions about whether

16

to buy, sell, or hold when a tender offer is on the

17

horizon.

18

Congress also knew that there is a great

19

opportunity for insider profiting because the information

20

about a tender offer is necessarily circulated to many

21

professionals in advance of the tender offer who then have

22

the opportunity to go out and trade on it, and as a result

23

of its recognition about the dangers of fraudulent and

24

deceptive practices and tender offers, Congress was not

25

content to rely simply on section 10(b) but drafted a new

and different antifraud provision which is backed up by

3

define and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent

4

fraudulent, deceptive, manipulative conduct.
QUESTION:

5

You omitted one little part there

6

from that sentence, Mr. Dreeben -- designed to prevent

7

such acts and practices as are fraudulent, deceptive, or

8

manipulative.
MR. DREEBEN:

9

QUESTION:

10

That's correct, Justice --

And it seems to me one could read

11

that as saying that that does not give the SEC authority

12

to define what is fraudulent, what is deceptive or

3

manipulative, but simply to define practices which are in

4

fact fraudulent, and you can't expand on the definition of

5

fraudulent or deceptive.

6

MR. DREEBEN:

There are several reasons, Chief

7

Justice Rehnquist, why I think that you're correct that I

8

omitted the words, acts or practices as are fraudulent,

9

but I think that the statute is accurately paraphrased the

20

way that I read it.
First, the regulatory authority that is found in

21

22

section

4(e) was modeled on a different section of the

23

securities laws, not section

24

which dealt with regulating broker-dealers, and in that

25

context Congress had specifically given the SEC the

0(b), but section

than would otherwise be imposed by the common law.

adopted that language in section

previously exercised its power to create new obligations

that weren't found in the common law, unless it's

7

reasonable to infer that Congress expected that authority

8

to be exercised in that fashion.
QUESTION:

Well, except, now, the Schreiber case

10

indicated that the SEC can't define offensive conduct more

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, didn't involve any SEC regulation at

MR. DREEBEN:

I think the footnote, read in

22

context, says that the mere promulgation of the regulatory

23

authority for the SEC, the addition of the sentence that

24

gave the SEC regulatory authority, didn't change the

25

meanings of the words in the first sentence, but the Court

1

expressly recognized that Congress had authority -- that

2

Congress had given authority to the SEC not only to define

3

acts or practices as are fraudulent but to prescribe means

4

reasonably designed to prevent them, and the Court

5

explicitly said there that the SEC could prohibit

6

nondeceptive conduct as a means reasonably designed to

7

prevent fraud.

8

So the Court in Schreiber I think did

9

acknowledge that the SEC has very vast regulatory power in

10

order to protect against the abuses that Congress had

11

identified in the tender offer context.

12

that by establishing a flat ban on trading by persons who

13

come into possession of information about an upcoming

14

tender offer when they know that it was received from the

15

bidder or somebody acting on its behalf, and that flat ban

16

serves two valuable purposes.

17

Rule 14(e)3 does

The first is that it protects shareholders who

18

are going to be facing a tender offer, or who actually are

19

facing a tender offer, from not having adequate time and

20

adequate information to make a decision whether to buy,

21

sell, or hold.

22

It also prevents collusion between the bidder

23

and other parties operating in the marketplace that has

24

not disclosed to the marketplace, as the Williams Act

25

requires, from buying up stock from unsuspecting

1

shareholders in the target company.

2

A second purpose that is served by 14(e)3 is the

3

prevention of fraudulent activity that involves,

as this

4

case did,

5

the bidder or law firm's accountants,

6

that represent it, and it thereby serves to prevent that

7

kind of fraud from occurring, which is a very great

8

danger, and which involves a very great danger of not

9

being detected, because this is in essence a crime that

the deceptive acquisition of information from
investment bankers

10

involves surreptitious activity that is not often easy to

11

bring to light.

So 14(e)3 carves out in the tender offer context

MR. DREEBEN:

6

As the SEC has defined the acts
4(e)3, it does not.

Right.
And I think that that is

justified, Justice O'Connor, on two bases.

First, Rule

4(e)3 in essence creates the duty to make disclosure,

7

drawing on Congress' recognition that tender offers pose

8

particular shareholder harms, and they pose particular

9

dangers that the shareholders will not be able to make an

10

important decision.
The SEC drew on the regulatory authority it was

11

12

given to impose a duty to make disclosure, and second, the

3

SEC's rule prevents violations that are akin to the

4

misappropriation violation that occurs under section

5

by ensuring that when someone has material information of

6

this character, they simply may not trade, even when there

7

is no proof of a breach of fiduciary duty and deception in

that.

The respondent in this case was a regular

securities fraud and sentenced to 41 months in prison.

The basis of that conviction was a set of legal

theories that are not incorporated into the text of any

19

that provide no guidance to participants in the stock

market.

apply to these facts.
On August 12, 1988, the Wall Street Journal

2

3

reported that a British firm called Grand Metropolitan had

4

put its hotel subsidiary, Intercontinental, up for auction

5

to raise money for an acquisition.
On August 18, just 6 days later, a financial

6

7

columnist named Dan Dorfman, announced on the Cable News

8

Network that people close to Grand Metropolitan -- and

9

that is a common synonym in the trade for people inside

10

Grand Metropolitan -- are telling people in the street

11

that Grand Metropolitan is interested in acquiring

12

Pillsbury.

13

Also on August 18, a broker called respondent to

14

advise that he'd received a $9 million order to buy

15

250,000 shares of Pillsbury stock for a customer in

16

London.

MR. FRENCH:

with a statute that involves, as Mr. Dreeben said,

disclosure.

If Mr. O'Hagan had made -- had had this private,

nonpublic information that you're hypothesizing and

disclosed to the Dorsey firm that he was going to trade on

it, according to the Government's theory he couldn't have

been prosecuted.

MR. FRENCH:

11

There is not even deception there.

There is theft, and contrary to Mr. Dreeben's position,

theft of a piece of information is no different from theft

It's not fraud.
You can be prosecuted for the theft vis-a-vis

yourself and the person from whom you stole, or the person

from whom you stole may proceed against you to recover the

difficult cases -- you know, what you call the

be fairly dealt with through a requirement that a criminal

conviction must be willful?

11

I notice that word was in the criminal section,

12

and does wilful mean that in this area, if you don't know

the law, that's an excuse, so therefore in any of these

borderline cases a defendant who didn't realize that what

15

he was doing was against the securities law would be home

free, and this would be reserved for the instances where

MR. FRENCH:

1

Well, Justice Ginsburg, two things

about the 1988 legislation.

3

whatever they mean, it was adopted after my client's acts,

4

and therefore it seems to me he can't have anticipated --

5

QUESTION:

First, .it was adopted --

Oh, I don't mean with respect to your

6

case, but you're asking us to make a ruling that will

7

govern not simply this day and case --

MR. FRENCH:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- but that will interpret 10(b) and

10

14(e), and so I would like to know what becomes of that

11

later legislation.

Is it in shambles?

MR. FRENCH:

12

I think what I'd like the Court to

13

do is think about all of the legislation and attempted

14

legislation throughout the 1980's in thinking about that

15

issue.

16

legislation that would have covered this subject matter,

17

would have covered the misappropriation area, and then

18

when Congress got ready to enact it said no, we would

19

prefer vagueness and ambiguity.

In 1984, the SEC went to the Congress and proposed

Please don't enact it.

20

Then in 1987, when the SEC went to the Congress

21

with a proposal to enact the misappropriation theory, the

22

Congress rejected it.

23

Then in '88 it enacted something having to do

24

4

It has

So my answer is the 1984 legislation and the

5

1988 legislation have to be left to apply to 10b-5 as

6

interpreted ultimately by this Court, and the Congress, if

7

it wants to get the misappropriation theory into law, has

8

to write it into law.

9

QUESTION:

So you disagree with what one of the

10

amici briefs said, that -- I think it was the one from the

11

NASAA -- stated that you virtually conceded that 0'Hagan's

12

conduct would have violated the 1988 act if it had post­

13

dated that legislation.

14

MR. FRENCH:

I disagree, Your Honor.

The amici

briefs -- one of the amicus briefs says the Congress

16

codified the misappropriation theory.

17

the Congress has validated the misappropriation theory.

19

misappropriation theory, but ratified it.

Everybody knows that

those insiders shouldn't go out and buy up stock in the

that that's so.

I don't think it does.

That's the

16

crucial sentence here which allows this agency, as I think

17

the Federal Trade Commission Act does not allow the

18

Federal Trade Commission to go beyond what the statute

19

says and to define other things as unlawful in order to

20

prevent the things that the statute prohibits.

21

I think that's the fair meaning of that

22

sentence, now.

Maybe you say that's an unconstitutional

23

delegation or something, but it seems to me you have to

24

grapple with the reality that Congress has told this

25

agency, you can make unlawful things that the statute does

MR. FRENCH:

You can put into a class of

prohibited conduct in some way or another things that you

define as reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent acts.
QUESTION:

And suppose you go on and say, and we

will treat these as if they were fraudulent acts?
MR. FRENCH:

I do not believe you can go on and

say, you may treat -- we will treat these as fraudulent

acts.

Well but the sanction is the same.

It just says that the sanction mechanisms of the statute
are employed.
MR. FRENCH:

You may not, Your Honor,

I think,

put people at risk of prosecution for fraudulent acts

committed in connection with a tender offer by announcing

that nonfraudulent acts are fraudulent acts and can be

Well,

there has to be the premise

that they're necessary to avoid other fraudulent acts.
QUESTION:

Of course,

deceptive, or manipulative.
MR. FRENCH:

the text says fraudulent,

It's kind of a broad term.

It certainly is, but I believe the

24

Court in Schreiber has equated deceptive and manipulative

25

under this statute with deceptive and manipulative under

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

15

In order to convict respondent on the section

16

10(b) count, the jury had to find that he acted with the

17

intent to deceive, manipulate, or deprive -- these are in

18

the jury instructions at page 199 of the joint appendix --

19

and the statutory requirement for the imposition of

20

imprisonment requires that he be shown to have knowledge

21

of the regulation or rule that he violated.

22

He cannot show that -- if he shows that he did

23

not have knowledge of it, he cannot be imprisoned, but the

24

statute does require proof of wilfulness in order to

25

sustain any criminal conviction.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Dreeben, I hate to use up any of

2

your short time, but there's a new point which came out in

3

oral argument here which I don't recall in the briefs, and

4

I want to know what your response to it is, and that is,

5

assuming that 14(e), as I think is true, does allow this

6

agency to make unlawful things that the statute itself

7

does not, has it purported to do that in its regulation?

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia --

And if it has not purported to do

10

that, has not purported by that regulation to prescribe

11

means reasonably designed, but rather in its regulation

12

simply redefines what constitutes fraud or deception, then

13

is that an exercise of the power that's given by that

14

second sentence of 14(e)?

15
16

MR. DREEBEN:
Scalia.

I think that it is, Justice

The ultimate -- may I answer?

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.
The ultimate question is whether

19

the SEC's prohibition on trading, which is clearly

20

described in the rule, is within its statutory authority,

21

which is a question for the court, and the court may

22

determine that the SEC's prohibition does satisfy the

23

statute based on either the defining prong or the means

24

reasonably designed to prevent, and it's analysis of the

25

reasons that are given.
