ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the marital and charitable

12

deductions to the Federal estate tax.

13

tax cases, and perhaps more so than most, this case

14

involves the central logical principle that is surrounded

15

and almost obscured by a wealth of technical detail.

16

would therefore like to focus first on the central logical

17

principle and discuss the technical issues later.

18

As with some other

I

The gross estate is defined as the value on the

19

date of death of the property owned by the decedent.

20

marital and charitable deductions to the gross estate are

21

defined by statute as the value of the property that

22

passes to the spouse and charity.

23

The

When, as in this case, the bequest left to the

24

spouse or charity is burdened by the obligation of paying

25

some expense or administration expense or other claim

1

against the estate, the value of the property that passes

2

under the bequest is obviously less than the full face

3

value of the bequest.

4

bequest, reduced by the cost of satisfying the obligations

5

that have been imposed on it.

6

It is the face value of the

Thus, in 1963, this Court explained in United

7

States v. Stapf that when the burden of paying

8

administration expenses or other claims against the estate

9

is placed on the marital bequest, the decedent has in

10

effect left that portion of the estate not to the spouse,

11

but has designated it for payment of the claims of others.

12

QUESTION:

And in that case it was the

13

decedent's act that did it, as I recall.

14

provision of the will that required it in that case?

15

MR. JONES:

Wasn't it the

It was -- actually if I remember

16

Stapf correctly, there was an option given to the heir as

17

to how to take under the will or not take under the will,

18

and it dealt with the specifics of the Texas community

19

property rules.

20

In this --

QUESTION:

In any case it didn't involve a

21

charge which was wholly contingent at the time of death

22

and which simply arose later and then, under the statutory

23

option, was charged against the marital share.

24
25

MR. JONES:

No, nor does this case.

In this

case, as several courts have explained, the obligation to

going to be a -- for example, a will contest or something

8

like that.

10

MR. JONES:

Exactly.

It's the valuation of that

later on that has to be conducted.
But in Stapf, the Court in speaking specifically

11

12

of administration expenses, said that they, like claims

13

against the estate, represent -- I'm sorry -- when the

14

obligation for administration expenses or to pay claims

15

against the estate is placed on the marital bequest, that

16

that reduces the value of the marital bequest because the

17

decedent has in concept set aside a portion of the bequest

18

not to go to the spouse, but to someone else.

19

obviously, the portion of the bequest that's to go to

20

someone else is not within the scope of the marital

21

deduction.

22

QUESTION:

And

Mr. Jones, if we value the estate at

23

the time of death, why don't we also value these

24

encumbrances at the time of death?

That is one part of

25

your argument that I don't follow.

have to understand almost every issue in the case, most of

10

which we haven't touched on yet, but there is a short

answer to that.
Administration expenses are themselves a

deduction under the Federal estate tax on a dollar-for-

MR. JONES:

3

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

This is --

And if the executor elects to pay the

deduction out of the estate, I can see why that should

reduce the estate.
But you're telling us that if there's a $50,000

7

administrative expense that we can anticipate down the

8

line, that it's the same thing, cases A, if $50,000 is

9

deducted from the corpus that ever goes to the

10

beneficiary, so he gets a corpus less $50,000; and case B,

11

he gets the full corpus and the income is fully sufficient

12

to pay the $50,000.
I'd much rather be the beneficiary in case 2

than case 1.

16

I just don't see -- they are just not the

MR. JONES:

Well, they -- I think I can give you

17

an example that would suggest, if I understood your point,

18

that they are the same.

19

If you had two alternative bequests, the

20

decedent calls you in his study and says, I'm going to let

21

you choose.

22

In both cases I'm going to give you a bank account with

23

$100,000 in it, and in both cases, you're not going to be

24

able to make withdrawal from those accounts for a year.

So, at the end of the year,

You'd say, I would like the first bequest

because the present value, the real value, of that bequest

9

is higher.

It's $100,000 on the date of death.

It's

10

$110,000 a year later.

The second bequest, the real

11

value, as the Court said in Stapf, is about $90,000

doesn't recognize discounted value -- time value at all.

MR. JONES:

The dollar-for-dollar --

19

QUESTION:

It's completely arbitrary.

20

MR. JONES:

The dollar-for-dollar theory, as you

21

have described it, recognizes that this issue serves at

22

the border between the estate tax and the income tax.

23

estate tax, as I've tried to state earlier, allows the

24

administration deduction on a dollar-for-dollar basis.

If

2

to a deduction for that entire $10,000 in valuing the

estate if they -- unless they attempted to take that

4

deduction on the income tax return.

5

Normally these time value of money things aren't

6

anywhere near as significant as they appear to be in this

7

case because normally you don't have a will contest

followed by a tax issue that goes to the Supreme Court.

9

Normally we're talking about estates being resolved within

10

a year or so.

11

As a practical mechanical matter --

QUESTION:

13

You're not suggesting that a

relatively large estate is usually resolved within a year.

MR. JONES:

Let me see if I can help you.

The

21

definition of administration expenses is in 2053(a) in the

22

regs under that, and it lists the things that you would

23

think of as administration expenses, arranging for the

24

disposition of the property and things of that nature.

Those are the kinds of

administration expenses that we're talking about in this

case.

4

represent administration expenses for this purpose.

together.

example in your reply brief would work out if you had

15

chosen to use as your illustration a charitable deduction

1

Would

the bottom line on page 3 be different if the example that

you had given us was a charitable deduction rather than a

The point is their contention gives them a tax

15

benefit both on the income tax return by claiming the

16

deduction there and on the estate tax return by, as the

17

case is described, purchasing the encumbrance and

18

obtaining additional value through the bequest by purchase

19

rather than inheritance.

20

QUESTION:

So, if in fact they have some patents

21

or something that are worth $11 million, but it costs $10

22

million to make them valid, all they have to do is pay

23

tax, income tax, on $11 million, i.e., come up with about

24

$4 million they don't have.

alternative is that you subtract the $10 million which

2

they had to expend from the estate, wiping out the value

of the estate.

seems that when they have an awful lot of money to spend,

to make the income really appear, they're forced to give

up either the estate --

(1:00 p.m.)

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Jones, I believe

4

you were about to answer Justice Breyer's question

5

tendered just before lunch.

6

QUESTION:

7

(Laughter.)

8

9

MR. JONES:

You just should say no.

Well, I don't recall frankly whether

to say yes or no, but what I recall is that your

10

hypothetical was where an asset of the value of $11

11

million is left to the spouse and it takes $10 million

12

thereafter to, shall we say, perfect title to the asset.

13

This is a classic example that the Court dealt

14

with in the Stapf case where the net value of the marital

15

bequest is the $11 million reduced by the obligation left

16

under the will to pay the administration expenses, which

17

turned out to be $10 million.

18

bequest was $1 million.

19

The spouse is entitled also to take an administration

20

expense deduction on the estate tax return, so there is no

21

taxable estate.

22

The net value of the

That's the marital deduction.

What happened in this case is that, in your

23

hypothetical, let's say $10 million in income was earned

24

by this asset after death.

25

could elect to take the administration costs against the

In that case, the executor

1

estate tax return and have zero income tax liability on

2

the $10 million of income.

3

And our point is that that doesn't affect the

4

calculation of the marital deduction.

5

deduction on the estate tax return is still $1 million.

6

They have elected not to take the administration expense

7

deduction on the estate tax return.

8

estate in that situation is $10 million, but there's no

9

income tax.

The marital

So, the taxable

So, under 642(g) you get to choose.

10

You can

11

take your administration expenses against the estate tax

12

or you can take them against the income tax.

13

get a credit for both, which is what they're asking for in

14

this case.

15

QUESTION:

You can't

Mr. Jones, could I follow up your

16

discussion of how although the marital deduction is

17

evaluated as of the time of death, you can take account of

18

later developments and make them retroactive back to the

19

time of death, such as the administrative expenses?

20

Now, that's certainly true in the estate tax

21

area, but what (b)(4)(B) requires here is that -- shall be

22

taken into account in the same manner as if the amount of

23

a gift to such spouse if such interests were being

24

determined.

25

Now, for purposes of the gift tax, let's assume

expenses of the trust to income or against the corpus of

A trust is

Now, for purpose of the -- and the trustee

He has that option.
Would you, for purposes of the gift tax, wait

8

and see what he did whether he charged it against the

9

income or not and then retroactively evaluate the value of

10

the gift to the spouse on the basis of whether that option

11

was exercised or not?
MR. JONES:

12

Because the -- in your hypothetical,

13

because the obligation to pay these expenses is on the

14

marital gift, you have to value that obligation in valuing

15

the gift.

MR. JONES:

It doesn't matter in valuing the

gift, but what matters in valuing the gift is knowing that

7

this obligation is in fact imposed on the marital

interest, the marital -- the property transferred, whether

9

it is imposed out of corpus or out of income.

10

Let me go back just one step because some of

11

these questions are more conceptually difficult as we're

12

discussing them than they need to be because in United

13

States v. Stapf, the Court authoritatively explained the

14

language of the statute that you're referring to and

15

explained in Stapf that the focus of the marital deduction

16

is on the value of the property that passes to the spouse.

17

And the Court said -- and I'm quoting -- the appropriate

reference, therefore, is not to the value of the property

MR. JONES:

When the case came up to this Court,

3

it had already been cited in the Commissioner's favor by

three or four other circuits, and I think that the other

circuit decisions were directly on the point of

administration expenses.

QUESTION:

8

MR. JONES:

9

Whereas Stapf wasn't?
Stapf was not directly on that

point, although Stapf answers that question by the Court's

10

discussion at the end which says that administration

11

expenses are like other claims against the estate, and

12

when -- in that when the marital bequest is burdened by

13

the obligation of paying those expenses, that in effect

14

leaves that portion of the estate to someone else rather

than to the spouse.

obligation imposed on it.

All of the applicable statutes

2

and regulations embody that principle.

3

and 2056(b)(4)(A) specify that when the obligation of

4

paying estate taxes is placed on the marital or charitable

5

bequest, that that reduces the value of those bequests and

6

therefore the amount of those deductions, without regard

7

to whether that tax is later paid with income or with

8

corpus.

Section 2055(c)

In section 2056(b)(4)(B), Congress specified the

9
10

same result when any encumbrance or obligation is placed

11

on the marital bequest.

12

that provision states crystal clearly that this reduction

13

in the value of the marital bequest and in the amount of

14

marital deduction must be made without regard to whether

15

that payment is ultimately made out of corpus or out of

2

I thought you said something --

didn't you just say something about marital deduction?

3

MR. JONES:

2056(b)(4)(A) and 2055(c) are

4

respectively the marital and charitable provisions that

5

deal with the reduction in those deductions when the

6

estate taxes are ultimately paid when those liabilities -

7

- when that obligation burdens those interests.
Justice Ginsburg, it might be possible -- I

8

mean, it would -- frankly, it would be possible to have

10

all of this done on a present value basis.

That's -- and

11

if we started from scratch, that system might well make a

12

lot of good sense, but you can't fit part of that present

13

value approach into a system that is a dollar-for-dollar

14

approach on all other items.

15

Congress by -- when they enacted 2056(b)(4)(B),

16

they did so as part of an effort to enlarge the system to

17

clarify the system of valuation that had derived from

What does such property or interest mean?

We

take a step upstream to 2056(b)(4) to the introductory

5

paragraph, and it says that property passing to the spouse

6

for which a deduction is allowable.

7

And what does that mean?

You go to the

8

introductory paragraph of 2056(a) and it says that the

9

deduction that is allowable is only to the extent that

10

it's included in the gross estate.
These two statutory provisions are the statutory

genesis for the undisputed point that you measure the

inclusion in the gross estate.

MR. AUGHTRY:

Actually, no, Your Honor, because

2

in that particular circumstance, it's a gift tax ruling.

3

The grant of the power occurs at the same time that the

4

transferring the gift tax does.

5

For example, if I'm making out a marital

6

deduction trust and I'm making a transfer, a gift today,

7

to my wife and if I provide this provision, the value is

measured today.

fiction is pitched in conflict with the majority rule

MR. AUGHTRY:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Much -- $2 million.

And it's worth

$2 million at the date of death and everybody is sure

5

there would be $200,000 worth of expenses.

under ordinary reasoning, the widow, if it was the man who

died, would get $1.8 million, forgetting other deductions,

and they'd pay $200,000.

that I can demonstrate to your satisfaction that that

And so, at first blush everything seems to stack

up nicely, but what happens is you only get to that result

and ignore the $2 million -- excuse me -- $200,000

you use $2 to create every $1 of deduction, and you ignore

the payments.

that is let's assume that in a situation there where the

11

expenses are paid out of income, that we're going to

pretend it reduces the marital corpus anyway, what that

13

does is that creates this gap, this disappearing

can't pay it out of there.

Mr. Jones, you have 1 minute remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

7

Thank you, Mr. Aughtry.

MR. JONES:

I have two points I will try to make

very briefly.
The first is that Stapf by its terms applies its

8

net value logic to administration expenses as well as to

9

other claims against the estate.

At page 134, the Court

10

said in both instances, referring to both administration

11

expenses and claims, by directing that payment be made of

12

debts chargeable to another or to non-estate property

13

reduces his net estate and in effect confers a gift or

14

bequest upon another, which is exactly why we have to

15

reduce the marital deduction because the net value of the

16

bequest has been burdened by this encumbrance.

17

I need to say very briefly that the regulations

18

and rulings that the Tax Court and that the taxpayer rely

19

on are a classic example of apples and oranges.

20

regulations and rulings that the Tax Court relied on were

21

under 2056(b)(5) which relates to a marital deduction when

22

a gift is left in trust, where the spouse gets --
