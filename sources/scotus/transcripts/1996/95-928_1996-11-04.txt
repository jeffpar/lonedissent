ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD W. STEVENS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. STEVENS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
At issue in this case is whether the FDIC, in

12

its capacity as Receiver of a federally chartered savings

13

association, has a Federal common law claim based on

14

simple negligence against the former directors and

15

officers of that association for breach of their fiduciary

16

duty of care, which is the proposition for which the

17

Government contends, or whether the FDIC's sole Federal

18

claim is the statutory claim for gross negligence under 12

19

U.S.C. section 1821(k), which is the proposition for which

20

we contend.

21

the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and

22

Enforcement Act of 1989, otherwise known as FIRREA.

23

That latter provision was adopted as part of

Although a divided panel of the Third Circuit

24

found that 1821(k) does not even apply to federally

25

chartered depository institutions, the Government has

conceded in this Court that it does.

Where petitioner and

2

the Government part company is on the question of whether

3

the FDIC has a preexisting Federal common law claim for

4

simple negligence and, if it does, whether that claim was

5

displaced by section 1821 (k) .

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Stevens, I think, if I remember

7

correctly, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals assumed

8

there was a Federal common law standard here, and left it

9

open on remand to the district court to determine the

10

scope of the standard, is that right?
MR. STEVENS:

11
12

Yes, Justice O'Connor, they did --

they -QUESTION:

13

Did the petitioners here concede in

14

the court of appeals that a Federal common law standard

15

applied?

16

MR. STEVENS:

No, we did not.

We argued to the

17

Third Circuit, which argument occurred subsequent to this

18

Court's decision in O'Melveny and Myers, that under that

19

decision there was no general Federal common law right of

20

action that accrued prior to the enactment of FIRREA.

21

QUESTION:

And do you think that the question

22

whether there exists a Federal common law rule was

23

preserved --

24

MR. STEVENS:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, I do.

QUESTION:

1

2

And what State law do you say applies

in this case?
MR. STEVENS:

3

It's our contention that the State

law that would apply in cases such as this would be the

5

law of the place of the location of the principal place of

6

business of the association.

In this case,

however, the FDIC has waived its State law claim.
QUESTION:

10
11

Which is?

But that was in response to the

district court's ruling, wasn't it?
MR. STEVENS:

12

No, Your Honor.

That was a

13

unilateral voluntary action taken by the FDIC and

14

articulated in its brief to the district court below when

15

the matter was being briefed in connection with the motion

16

to dismiss.

decision by the FDIC.

It was not an action taken subsequent to the

QUESTION:

19

It was a voluntary, unilateral

But do I understand correctly that

20

the district court's opinion said that 1821(k) was the

21

exclusive law applicable to a Federal, federally chartered

22

institution?

MR. STEVENS:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.

And you are not defending that

position.

3

QUESTION:

So no one is supporting the district

4

court, who said that 1821(k) is just it, there's nothing

5

else?

6

MR. STEVENS:

Well, let me be clear.

It's our

7

position that the only Federal law claim that the FDIC has

8

postreceivership is a claim for gross negligence under

9

section 1821(k).

It is our position, however, that that's

10

not the only claim that's available to the Government.

11

The Government would also have a claim under State law for

12

simple negligence if the State law in question provided

13

such a claim.

14

QUESTION:

15

the district court was wrong.

Yes, so to that extent you agree that

MR. STEVENS:

QUESTION:

May I ask --

It's also --

QUESTION:

I don't think the briefs tell us what

22

the rule is in New Jersey.
MR. STEVENS:

Well, to be candid, Your Honor, I

think that's why the FDIC waived its State law claim.

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. STEVENS:

25

Yes, Your Honor.

It's our position that the

standard in New Jersey is gross negligence.

So it really doesn't matter, then, if

there's a
MR. STEVENS:

I don't think it does.

I'm sure

4

the FDIC will argue that it's in fact simple negligence,

5

but at this point it's an academic issue because they've

6

waived the claim.

7

QUESTION:

Well, it might not be.

They've

8

waived that legal basis for the claim, but I would think

9

there's a question whether the basically alleging the

10

same, you know, misconduct by the defendants in the case.

11

Whether it's too late for them to say an alternative legal

12

base for the claim would be State law even though we

13

haven't argued it up to now, I'm not sure what the answer

14

to that is is all I'm saying.

15

about whether there is a difference, but the answer to

16

that is, you would disagree with your opponents, probably.

17

MR. STEVENS:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. STEVENS:

20

That's why I was curious

Correct.

Okay.
We would take the position there's

no difference.

21

QUESTION:

Do you --

22

QUESTION:

If the State law issue -- the State

23

law standard were, let's say, intentional negligence, you

24

would still concede that there was a gross negligence

claim under (k), is that right?

that this Court has made it clear that for Federal common

QUESTION:

Well now, wait a minute.

That's a

separate question.

15

applies, but the Federal law in turn refers to State law.

16

You could say yes, Federal law

MR. STEVENS:

Well, that would be predicated

17

upon a finding that the criteria for the application of

18

Federal law, Federal common law is present, but that there

19

is no conflict, and that there's no conflict between the

20

application of State law and Federal law as in Kimbell

21

Foods, where this Court held that the issue there was

22

governed by Federal law, but that there was no reason not

23

to use State law as the rule of Federal decision.

24
25

But before you can get to that point, you have
to decide that there's a uniquely Federal interest

present.

2

uniquely Federal interest is present because this Court

3

has defined such interest principally to involve the

4

rights and duties of the United States and, as this Court

5

said in O'Melveny, the FDIC is not the United States, and

6

even if it were it, would be begging the issue because the

7

FDIC is asserting claims in this case in its capacity as a

8

receiver for the institution, standing in the shoes of the

9

institution.

10

And it's our position that in this case no such

In fact, the FDIC's position would not only

11

require the application of Federal common law to cases

12

where it's bringing the claims, it would require the

13

application of Federal common law if the institution when

14

solvent was bringing claims like this against its

15

directors and officers or if a shareholder of a solvent

16

institution was bringing a derivative action where the

17

FDIC itself wouldn't be a party, where no United States

18

entity would be a party, where no United States funds

19

would be directly involved, and where not even the

20

insurance fund would be directly involved.

21

QUESTION:

The only thing to be said on the

22

other side, however, is what -- it's -- other corporations

23

that are established under Delaware law, New Jersey law,

24

or whatever, they have a clear law to apply when there is

25

a suit by shareholders as far as internal management is

Congress set up this Federal corporation without any

internal procedures governed by Federal law?

You know what the law is.

7

statutory provisions in it that talk about what banks

9

their operations and so forth, but there's nothing in that

They have adopted a statute, HOLA, the

10

statute that talks about a standard of care for officers

11

and directors.

When was that adopted?

It was before Erie, but Congress

QUESTION:

So I guess what Congress was thinking

20

at the time was that there is up in the sky there a common

21

law concerning directors' liability.

22

MR. STEVENS:

Well, it might have thought that

23

there was a State common law, but it would have been hard

to think that there was a Federal common law.

There was no such thing as State common law and

2

Federal common law before Erie.

3

MR. STEVENS:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. STEVENS:

I agree, but --

We made that up after Erie.
Correct, Your Honor, but in this

6

Court's decision in Herrmann v. Edwards and Whittemore v.

7

Amoskeag Bank, the Court made it clear that the mere fact

8

that there was an assertion by shareholders of a national

9

bank against its directors and officers for mismanagement

10

was not sufficient to give rise to a Federal cause of

11

action where the assertion was made under common law.

2

Now, I think the Court was saying in that case,

3

this is a case for the application -- in those two cases,

4

those are cases for the application of State law, not

5

Federal law.

6

QUESTION:

What you're saying is, we -- in light

7

of what happened after Erie we should treat corporate law

8

the same way we treat contract law.

there was a Federal law, having discovered there is not,

Although we thought

it goes back to being governed by State law.
MR. STEVENS:

Well, assuming for the sake of

22

argument that there was a Federal common law pre-Erie in

23

this area, yes, Erie demolishes it.

QUESTION:

No, but you're --

6

QUESTION:

So then you're not -- then you're not

7

getting the pointing rule from State law, because State

8

law would say, we look to the State of incorporation to

9

determine matters of internal operations.

10

MR. STEVENS:

That's correct, but I think you

11

have to keep in mind that historically the reason they

12

looked to the State law of incorporation was because that

13

was where the principal place of business was.

14

Now, it's true that over time that's changed,

15

and as Delaware passed laws that made it more receptive to

16

corporations, more and more corporations incorporated

17

there even though their principal places of business were

18

elsewhere, but the concept here to my way of thinking is

19

that the Federal Government, the only Federal banking

20

agencies that's indicated any thoughts on this has said

5

MR. STEVENS:

6

QUESTION:

I think that's right, Your Honor.

Yes, but even on Justice Scalia's

7

analysis, you've still got to have a basis for looking to

8

some State law somewhere, and it seems to me that your

9

answer to Justice Ginsburg boils down to this, that in

10

addition to the O'Melveny standard, there's another source

11

of Federal common law here, and the source is something

12

like necessity.

13

If there's got to be a basis for court dealing

14

with a federally chartered institution, to say what law

15

applies, there is of necessity a Federal common law to the

16

extent of deriving a pointing rule, and you're saying, I

17

think, the necessity here is that Federal laws say that

18

you look to the State of principal place of business.

MR. STEVENS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

And I take it that if the State of

3

New Jersey allowed an action for simple negligence, that

4

would be permissible under the Reserve Clause?

5

MR. STEVENS:

6

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

So they have to allow at least gross

7

negligence, but if they have a more proplaintiff standard

8

of liability than that, that, too, is incorporated.

9

MR. STEVENS:

That's correct, which I think is

10

entirely consistent with the policy behind FIRREA and the

11

legislative history of the act.

Could all this be solved by

you can only make loans that have this loan-to-value

3

could establish standards of conduct for virtually every

aspect of the operations of the institution.

5

They

I don't believe that they could articulate a

6

standard that would create a Federal common law standard

7

of liability for application in Federal court actions,

8

civil court actions, and the reason for that is that

9

Congress in section 1818(b)(6)(a), which was part of

10

FIRREA, has provided an administrative remedy for all the

11

Federal banking agencies to pursue claims against Federal

12

and State-chartered institution thrifts and directors, and

13

to recover losses from those individuals incurred as a

14

result of their misconduct.

provision Congress has said that such recoveries can only

16

be had where there is a showing of either unjust

17

enrichment or reckless disregard.

18

But in that statutory

Congress imposed that statutory standard, and I

19

don't believe that any of the Federal banking agencies has

20

the authority to adopt a less stringent standard than that

MR. STEVENS:

QUESTION:

9

MR. STEVENS:

-- 21 (k)?
The savings clause in this statute

10

doesn't help the Government here for several reasons.

11

What the savings clause says is that nothing in this

12

paragraph shall impair or affect any right of the FDIC

13

under other applicable law.

14

read in a way that renders the first sentence of 1821(k)

inoperative.

QUESTION:

Other applicable law can't be

Well, it isn't inoperative if you

17

look at it from the point of view that at least faced with

18

State law that says you need intentional misconduct, that

19

the Federal law says no gross negligence will suffice, so

20

of course it isn't inoperable.

21

MR. STEVENS:

It isn't -- it doesn't render the

language inoperable with respect to State-chartered

then it means just what Justice O'Connor said, and what we

would do if the principal place of business is New Jersey,

MR. STEVENS:

Absolutely correct.

I - - we do

not contend that the savings clause precludes the

Government from asserting a claim for simple negligence

QUESTION:

12

That is not our contention.

And also that would be true if, as

13

you've just said, the Federal law is that we look to the

18

QUESTION:

Why not?

19

MR. STEVENS:

For this reason.

In City of

20

Milwaukee, one of the arguments that was made there was

21

that there was a statutory section that dealt with citizen

22

suits, and there was a provision in that section that said

23

that any person was preserved the right to assert any

24

remedy under State or common law, and that respondent in

that case argued -- petitioner in that case argued that

1

that savings clause preserved Federal common law.

2

The Court rejected that argument and said at

3

most -- at most, that language only provided that that

4

section dealing with citizen rights didn't have the effect

5

of impacting a claim under common law, but that didn't

6

mean that the comprehensive nature of the act as a whole

7

didn't displace Federal common law, number

8

2, it made the comment that the term common law as used in

9

that savings clause was highly unlikely to have meant the

10

specific narrowly construed Federal common law as opposed

11

to the more generic State common law.

, and number

12

In this statutory provision, the savings clause

3

doesn't even use the phrase, common law, and in our brief

4

we point to a number of statutory provisions where when

5

Congress wanted to save Federal common law it did so

6

expressly.

7

Here, the only phrase used is other applicable

8

law, and we think that means Federal statutory law, State

9

statutory law, State common law, which is the routine

20

common law, but not the narrow, specific, rarely invoked

2

Federal common law.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Stevens, I thought your position

23

was that there was in effect nothing to save, because

24

there never was any governing Federal common law.

MR. STEVENS:

That is our position.

1

Which is quite different from -- your

2

answer to Justice Breyer seemed to imply there was Federal

3

common law but there is no longer by virtue of the first

4

sentence of 1821(k).

5

MR. STEVENS:

I didn't mean to say that, Your

6

Honor.

Our position is there never was a Federal common

7

law claim.

8

should the court determine that there was a preexisting

9

Federal common law claim for simple negligence that

There isn't now.

Our alternative argument is,

10

existed prior to the adoption of FIRREA, then Congress'

11

reference to gross negligence standard in that statutory

12

provision displaces that preexisting Federal common law,

13

and that preexisting Federal common law is not preserved

14

by the savings clause, so it's an alternative argument.

15

QUESTION:

But your position is that there is no

substantive Federal common law, no common law governing

QUESTION:

Well, I have one last question.

I'd

below that Federal common law governed.

5

Becker's opinion says both parties conceded that.

6

MR. STEVENS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. STEVENS:

9

Now, Judge

Your Honor --

So was that an error?
Yes.

We are -- we did argue at

the district court level that Federal law governed.

We

10

did make that argument, and we have reversed our position

11

since then, but we reversed it at the Third Circuit level

12

in light of this Court's decision in O'Melveny and Myers,

13

not because the law fundamentally changed with that

14

decision, to be honest, but because that decision focused

15

attention on the fact -- on the importance of the

16

proposition that there is no general Federal common law,

17

and we argued to the Third Circuit that the Government's

18

position was wrong because it had no general Federal

19

common law claim.

The Third Circuit was in error.

20

What we did concede is that the only thing at

21

issue in that case, because they had waived their State

22

law claim, was, what was the nature of their Federal law

the facts of that case involved a State-chartered

at the beginning of that opinion I don't believe are

limited by the fact that the institution in that case was

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. BRESS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. BRESS:

5
6

7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Section 1821(k) is a plainly worded provision,

8

and in our view it means precisely what it says.

It

9

provides that the FDIC as receiver may hold officers and

10

directors of failed financial institutions liable for

11

their gross negligence or worse misconduct while

12

preserving the FDIC's preexisting right to assert against

13

those officers and directors whatever claims the

14

institution could have asserted on its own behalf.

15
16
17

Now, petitioner's argument to the contrary is
based on a supposed negative implication.
QUESTION:

At least --

They haven't argued to the contrary.

18

They would agree with everything you've said so far.

only issue is, they don't think there are any rights that

it had under --

MR. BRESS:

Well, the arguments have sort of

switched place in terms of what's primary and what's not

5

can address the underlying law at this point.

6

like to note before I do it that either Federal common law

7

exists, in which case the statute preserves the FDIC's

8

right to assert it, or Federal law, common law doesn't

9

exist, in which case we're all agreed that State law

If you'd like, Your Honor, I
I'd just

10

governs and that the FDIC can assert the institution's

11

State law claims.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BRESS:

I think that's generally agreed.
All right, and I'd like to note one

14

extra thing at this point which is, to the degree that

15

there's an argument here that the FDIC has waived its

16

State law claims, there has been no waiver here.

the third amended complaint that's been filed simply

going to address, but you contend there is a Federal

2

common law that is applicable.

3

MR. BRESS:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, Your Honor.
And is the Federal common law rule

one that is the same in all States in the country?

6

MR. BRESS:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
And why, then, is the Federal

8

statutory gross negligence law -- rule somewhat different

9

in different States?

10

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, that can be explained by

11

what the state of the law was at the time that Congress

12

acted, and what Congress' purposes here were.

13

This was emergency legislation, and Congress had

14

a very simple purpose, which was to preempt State

15

insulating statutes that could insulate officers and

16

directors of financial institutions from liability to the

17

FDIC.

18

Now, at that time, while the majority of courts

19

were applying the uniform ordinary care standard of

20

Federal common law to officers and directors of federally

21

chartered associations, some courts were applying State

22

law to officers and directors of federally chartered

23

associations.

24
25

Congress didn't try to sort out which was the
right answer.

Congress just wanted to make sure, whatever

1

a court might otherwise apply, the FDIC would always have

2

a suit for gross negligence, so if a court would apply the

3

State's law to a federally chartered association, Congress

4

was telling them, well, apply that State's gross

5

negligence standard.

6

However, if a court were to apply Federal common

7

law the question really would never come up, because under

8

Federal common law the standard is, and has for a long

9

time, been a standard of ordinary care.

10

QUESTION:

That's by no means the only reading

11

of that statute, certainly.

interpretation is certainly not the only one that comes

from the language.

I mean, to -- your

No, Your Honor, but we believe it's

the one that makes the most sense out of the language in

the following sense.

FDIC's rights under other applicable law.

The savings clause preserves the

Now, at the time, Congress is presumed to enact

19

laws with knowledge of what the surrounding law is, and at

20

that time the vast majority of courts were applying

21

Federal common law to suits against officers and directors

22

of federally chartered associations, so to take their

23

interpretation of the statute you have to believe that

24

Congress missed that entirely and believed that State law

was applicable.

MR. BRESS:

I'm talking about preinsolvency, and

the standard, should that mean that the Federal chartering

another thing to say that the Federal courts should step

MR. BRESS:

Well, Your Honor, I'm glad you've

mentioned that.

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, there are several

May I interrupt with one question?

Your argument based on 1818(i) and (e) and the regulatory

two separate standards that are going to apply to the

However, as petitioner has effectively conceded

We're just pointing to it as a matter of convenience, Your

Honor, and in that circumstance --

4

QUESTION:

Yes, but if you're right that those

5

sections dictate ordinary care across the board, Congress

6

didn't have to enact this statute.

7

MR. BRESS:

No, Your Honor, and I think Congress

8

did, because there's no question that ordinary care is the

9

standard for purposes of Federal regulatory enforcement as

10

a Federal standard, because the statute was enacted to

11

protect the Federal interest in the safety and soundness

12

of all banks.

13

However, Congress recognizes that States are the

14

ones that dictate the civil standards of liability for

15

their own institutions, the rights of the institution and

16

the shareholders vis-a-vis the directors.

17

You have two different standards for States

because you've got two different sovereigns.

one sovereign with an interest in it, and under HOLA, as

the threshold of gross negligence is good enough, so there

doesn't seem to be any occasion to develop a common law to

supplement that.

4

MR. BRESS:

Your Honor, I think what the

5

statute's telling you, and I think that what's actually

6

the case here, is that there is a Federal interest, for

7

instance, with regard to all banks whether they're State

8

or Federal, that's clear, and in 1821(k) that interest was

9

the Federal interest as in Shaw, and what Congress did is

10

said -- the first draft, in fact, of the Senate bill would

11

have allowed the FDIC to proceed as receiver under any

12

common law action, including ordinary negligence.

13

There were objections to that that were

14

federalism-based.

15

look, what you're talking about are, you're including

16

corporations that we've chartered, and as to which we

17

dictate the internal affairs, and some States might

18

legitimately believe that gross negligence rather than

19

ordinary negligence is the right standard.

20

The federalism-based objection said,

So Congress compromised.

They said the FDIC

will always be able to sue for gross negligence even

Your Honor, 1821(k) says that if the

What we're saying is that with regard to

their own directors and officers are governed by Federal

law because they operate under a Federal charter, and in

determining what those rights are and what the duties are,
we can either look for the State pointer -- and by the

way, the pointer is not always going to look to States

cause or are likely to cause more than minimum damage to

Now, I grant that that section doesn't say what

5

breach of fiduciary duties means, but this Court has long

6

looked, and the latest case is DeSaterfield v. Mans and

7

CCNV v. Reid -- has long said that when the Congress uses

8

a common law term, we look to what that term -- whether

9

that term had an established meaning.

10

The term did have an established meaning, and

11

that included the duty of ordinary care, and if you rule

12

against us, Your Honor, what will occur is that officers

13

and directors of Federal institutions will have different

and varying duties of care.

QUESTION:

Then you are taking the position,

Mr. Bress, that the first sentence has no application to a

applying State law to Federal institutions, so Congress --

QUESTION:

You were saying that Congress said we

don't know what it is, but whatever it is, we're not

leaving -- we're leaving it alone.
MR. BRESS:

7

Whenever the law is out there, we're

leaving it alone.

8

If they were going to apply State law to you,

9

and that State law would not give you a cause of action

10

for gross negligence, you've got it.
QUESTION:

11

But you are saying, if your reading

12

is correct that there is an ordinary negligence, Federal

to resort to the gross negligence part --

MR. BRESS:

By virtue of this Court's decision,

if the Court were to rule that way, there would be no need

21

to resort to the first sentence.

22

However,

I am at pains to emphasize that at the

time Congress passed the statute, that sentence would have

had meaning even with regard to Federal associations

Congress hadn't included Federal associations within the

first sentence, then as to those courts that were applying

State law to Federal charters, you wouldn't have a

So a subsequent event, this Court's decision

unifying the law and saying that there is a Federal common

law standard, and I don't believe the Court has to go on

9

and say what it is, but if it does, it's ordinary care --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BRESS:

Well --- a subsequent decision of that

12

sort would render the first sentence of no practical

13

effect with regard to Federal charters, that's true.

14

QUESTION:

It's that last part.

I want to be --

15

assume I'm with you.

16

1821(k) leaves Federal common law where it found it, all

right.

Assume for the sake of argument that

That's base.
Now, where did it find it, and what you're

1818(e) and (i), from my finding it here, are these

infinitely long page-full procedural requirements that go

on endlessly that I can't find anything that seems to be

relevant, except for one sentence that refers to gross or

5

continuing disregard, or something like that.
MR. BRESS:

6

All right, Your Honor, let me

7

address that.

We're not saying that Congress acted in

8

recognition of the standard under 1818 (i) or 1818 (e) at

9

the point when it enacted 1821(k).

What we're saying is

10

that when it enacted 1821(k), Justice Breyer, the courts,

the majority, vast majority of courts at that time were

12

already applying a uniform ordinary care standard.
