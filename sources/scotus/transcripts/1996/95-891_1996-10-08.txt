CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 95-891, Ohio v. Robert D. Robinette.
Mr. Ingram.

Oh, pardon me.

Ms. Ingram.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLEY J. INGRAM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. INGRAM:

8

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves a traffic stop, a driver's

11

consent to search, and the discovery of drugs in his car.

12

The question before the Court is whether the Fourth

13

Amendment requires a police officer to warn a motorist at

14

the end of a traffic stop that he's free to go, and that

15

if the officer fails to give that warning, any cooperation

16

by the motorist from that point on must be presumed to be

17

involuntary.

18

QUESTION:

Under State law, does the officer

19

have the discretion to give or not to give a ticket after

20

he talks to the motorist?

21

MS. INGRAM:

Your Honor, there is a statute

22

that -- if it is a traffic stop, the officer may simply

23

cite the motorist if he has proof of identification, which

24

doesn't have to be a driver's license.

25

QUESTION:

Does -- is cite the same as giving a

He may cite or warn at his discretion.
QUESTION:

So he may cite or warn, and that

5

obviously takes a certain amount of time to make that

6

determination of what he's going to do?

officer has a certain amount of discretion.

MS. INGRAM:

QUESTION:

MS. INGRAM:

QUESTION:

16

Yes, he does.
And so he has to have a certain

amount of time within which to exercise that discretion.

11

13

I take it the

That's correct, Your Honor.
Once he says, I'm not going to give

you a ticket, can he change his mind?
MS. INGRAM:

He could change is mind, certainly,

and give the ticket.
QUESTION:

If there's a flippant response, or a

17

response that indicates that maybe the person has less

18

regard for the law than the officer thought at first?

19

MS. INGRAM:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct,

20

and the question would then become whether or not the

21

officer's decision to change his mind when he told the

22

person he wasn't going to give him the ticket and then

23

decided to give the ticket would have an effect on whether

24

or not the person felt then that he was free to leave, or

25

he was being coerced in some -4

QUESTION:

1

Quite without reference to a search,

2

the officer would be entitled to detain the motorist after

3

the officer changed his mind and said, well, based on what

4

your remarks are, I've changed my mind.

5

you a ticket.

6

MS. INGRAM:

7

QUESTION:

8

I'm going to give

Yes, the officer could do that.
There is no right to leave once the

officer proceeds in that way until the ticket is written.

9

MS. INGRAM:

Right, that's correct, until the

10

ticket is written or the warning is given, yes, Your

11

Honor.
QUESTION:

12

13

And that State law is consistent with

our cases, and with the Fourth Amendment?

14

MS. INGRAM:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Let me ask you another nuts and bolts

16

question.

17

this case, does he present the motorist with a document, a

18

piece of paper that says,

19

warnings, or is it customarily, and was it in this case,

20

just an oral statement saying, I warn you not to do it

21

again?

22

When he decides to give a warning, as he did in

MS. INGRAM:

"warning"?

Do they record these

23

ways.

written warning.

QUESTION:

So he had given him a statement which

2

said, in effect, on its face that it was a warning before

3

he began the conversation about whether there was anything

4

improper in the car?
MS. INGRAM:

5
6

Yes, Your Honor, and he had also

returned his driver's license to him --

QUESTION:

8

MS. INGRAM:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- at that point.
Do you think at that point he could

10

have changed his mind and said, well, I've given you a

11

warning, but after thinking about it I'm going to give you

12

a ticket now?
MS. INGRAM:

13

If he had told -- if he had told --

14

if -- it would have been very difficult, then, for the

15

officer to justify, without anything further happening,

16

giving him a ticket on just his change of mind, but --

18

QUESTION:
could --

MS. INGRAM:

QUESTION:

22

I thought you said earlier that he

-- the question -I thought you said earlier he could

change his mind.
MS. INGRAM:

After he's given him the warning I

23

think it would be more difficult, but I think that the

24

question of the validity of what he did on that would

25

affect whether or not the speeding ticket, whether or not

that was -- whether or not the validity of the speeding

QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking the question to

determine his right to detain the motorist.
MS. INGRAM:

He had the right -- if the motorist

8

did nothing further but give the officer a flippant

9

answer, then the business of the stop is over, the officer

10

has made his decision to give a warning, the officer's

11

discretion is still controlling it, and under Ohio law,

12

there's nothing that would prevent the officer at that

13

point from issuing him the ticket.

kind of discretion.

QUESTION:

The officer has that

After the warning has already -- is

MS. INGRAM:

QUESTION:

In this case it was, Your Honor.
So you can give them both a written

warning and then after that say, in addition to that I'm

Okay.

QUESTION:

5

Is there any decisional law or

administrative rulings in Ohio to support what you just

say, or are you kind of going by, you know, what you think

8

is probably the case?

MS. INGRAM:

10

To support the -- to support that

the officer can -QUESTION:

11

The idea that he -- the patrolman has

12

given the respondent, here, a warning.

13

gives the patrolman some indication that he has contempt

14

for the law or something like that, or something causes

15

the patrolman to change his mind.

in any litigated case?

Well, Ms. Ingram --

22

then?

I -- what do you base your answer on?
MS. INGRAM:

whether or not to issue a ticket or a warning, and the

2

final issuance of a ticket even if he's already issued a

3

warning is part of the business of a traffic stop, so

4

whether or not -QUESTION:

5

No, but I'm asking you, what do you

6

base your answer on as to State law as to whether, having

7

issued a warning, you can then, in light of a flippant

8

answer or anything else, void the warning and issue a

9

traffic ticket?
We can't do that.

10

I mean, when we issue a

11

judgment, if the lawyer who loses -- who wins makes some

12

flippant comment about our judgment --

13

(Laughter.)

14

QUESTION:

15

--we can't call or go back and say,

wait a minute, we've thought about it again.

16

(Laughter.)

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. INGRAM:

Now, a policeman can do that, though?
A policeman has the discretion to

19

decide whether to warn or cite, yes, Your Honor, and --

20

and the fact -- I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

Well, I know he has the discretion to

do that.

MS. INGRAM:

1

Because a warning is not a final

2

order.

It's not -- it's not a final order.

3

break, he's doing something he doesn't have to do.

QUESTION:

Well, common sense.

8

QUESTION:

Ms. Ingram, is that what happened

10

here, or did he just get a warning and then we went into
this business about, may I search?
MS. INGRAM:

11

That is not what happened here.

12

just was the warning, and then the question of, are you

13

carrying any illegal drugs or contraband.

QUESTION:

Okay, and do you mind telling me, at

15

the traffic stop, did the officer order Robinette to get

out of the car before he checked the driver's license, do

18

MS. INGRAM:

Your Honor, he checked the driver's

19

license, then ordered him out of the car, then returned

20

the driver's license and gave him a lecture on speeding.

QUESTION:

MS. INGRAM:

1

real dispute about what happened between Robinette and the

2

officer during that actual encounter.
QUESTION:

3

May I suggest that your answer about

4

whether he could have changed his mind and all is based on

5

the common sense notion that as long as the two people are

6

standing there together, the officer retains control of

7

the situation?
MS. INGRAM:

8

9

That's correct, yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

12

Is that so even after the ticket is

issued?

MS. INGRAM:

QUESTION:

Unless the -You'd say the officer is still in

control and the person can't leave, even after he gives

him a final ticket?

QUESTION:

MS. INGRAM:

They're still standing there.
And -Is the officer in control?
If the officer -- if the officer

20

gives him the final ticket, and that is the last thing

21

that has to do with the business of the traffic stop, and

22

nothing further has happened to give the officer any more

23

justification to hold him, then the person is free to go.

QUESTION:

And the officer isn't in control in

that sense.

cause this person to believe that his continued presence

16

He was free to go in this case when the warning was

issued, and when the police officer gave him back his

18

driver's license.

19

In fact, at the suppression hearing he testified

20

that at that point, when the officer then asked him, did

you believe you were free to go at that point, he said

22

yes, I did, and he answered that way twice under

he believed at that point he was free to go.

QUESTION:

Was he --

3

QUESTION:

Can we go back a little bit in time,

4

because the Ohio supreme court, which is the one thing

5

that we have before us, seemed to say that the lawful stop

6

had ended before the officer commanded Robinette to get

7

out of the car.

8

Under the Ohio supreme court's opinion, once the

9

police office checked Robinette's license, every aspect of

10

the speeding violation had been investigated and resolved.

11

These are the words of the Ohio supreme court.

12

Ohio supreme court concluded that the detention stopped

being lawful and became unlawful when the officer

However, in Ohio --

It's the syllabus that counts, and

isn't that an accurate statement of the first point in the

20

syllabus?

21

MS. INGRAM:

No, Your Honor, it isn't.

The

first syllabus depends on the resolution of the question

23

of what is continued detention, and if this Court -- and

is based and relies on the Court's holding that unless

these words are spoken, detention will be presumed, so if

QUESTION:

position is, is there is no ambiguity in syllabus 1,

2

because it's a correct statement of the law.

QUESTION:

But if you go on with the Ohio

supreme court's opinion, before they get to this business

5

about a warning they say, even assuming Newsome's

6

detention of Robinette was legal throughout the time when

7

Newsome handed back Robinette his driver's license.

8

first part of the opinion says it wasn't a legal

detention, and then it goes on, even if it was legal,

10
11

The

there had to be a warning.
So the first part seems to say the detention,

12

once the police officer satisfied himself with the license

13

check, was unlawful, period, and then we go on to, but

14

even if it was lawful.

MS. INGRAM:

Your Honor, once again I'd ask you

16

writer said -- he gave several different points in which

2

the opinion writer concluded that there was a continued

3

detention and that there was conduct unrelated to the

4

violation going on, and the only thing the court said

5

appears in number 2, syllabus 2, which when you put the

6

two together, I think the only holding of the court is

7

there was continued detention at the time the consent was

8

sought because of the failure to give the free-to-leave

9

warning, and that questioning was unrelated to the

violation.
I think when you look at the first point, it

12

would -- the opinion writer's view is flawed for two

13

reasons, and that is, 1) he relies on the motivation of

14

the officer, which under this Court's decision in Wren is

15

simply incorrect, it's an objective test, and the second

16

point is, at the point in time at which the officer

17

ordered the respondent out of the car, he had not yet

18

issued a warning, he had not yet returned a license, so it

19

simply is not true that the business of the traffic stop

20

had been completed at that point.

21

I think what the Ohio supreme court opinion

22

writer was suggesting was that the officer was required to

reach into the car and to give back the license and to

say, here's your warning, rather than order the person out

Not dispositive, because a

reasonable to order somebody out of the car when you're

going to have interaction and you haven't completed the

QUESTION:

Is there any difference between a

consensual encounter, where the person has never been

under detention, and a case where there has been a

9

detention and then it's asserted that the detention ended

10

and the rest was consensual?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

11

I would say that you apply the

12

same totality of the circumstances test, but of course, in

13

applying that test, you take into account in deciding

14

whether at a later point in time something is consensual

15

or a seizure, that at an earlier point in time there was a

seizure.

That is a relevant factor in deciding, but it

does not change the ultimate inquiry, which is whether on

Mr. Gornstein, maybe -- maybe we

Looking at the merits of the case, obviously the

issues that the supreme court confronted were significant

19

in terms of its citizens in Ohio, and the backdrop of the

20

case is extremely important, because the Court of Appeals

of the Second District, that reviewed this case initially,

22

indicated that it was adopting its holding and its opinion

what's developed is, how does the citizen truly know when

what is the citizen confirming, what is the officer doing,

what is the citizen, or the motorist standing there, what

understanding did he have of what is transpiring, and what

the Ohio supreme court looks at is, attempting to provide

at least some very minimal protection to the motorist

the Court, which clearly finds that there was an unlawful

15

It's a burden without a benefit, because once

that threshold is met of showing that these warnings were

given, the analysis must proceed to whether or not, under

the totality of the circumstances, there was a detention

of a bright line test, it doesn't afford the benefit of
