we've had submitted what I think of as a gigantic

then what happens to

I

believe that that would strengthen a state's

The state in our

view is entitled to think that introducing lethal

medication into a system is -- puts an even

9

greater risk on those who are -- particularly

10

those who are poor and those who are handicapped,

11

an even greater risk if that system is decreasing

the amount of palliatives.
If a person supposedly is making a
