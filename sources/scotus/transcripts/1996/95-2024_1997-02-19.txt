ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT J. SHAPIRO

11

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In this case, the district court used an

15

unconstitutional process to achieve an unconstitutional

16

result in the form of plan 386.

17

Before commencing my argument, I would like to

18

make a correction in my reply brief which is important in

19

that it's a reference to the record.

20

reply brief I referred to the preclearance denial letter

21

of the Justice Department as R. 18 -- I'm sorry, as R. 13,

22

and it's actually in the record at R. 18, and the full

23

text is at R. 18.

On page 14 of the

I also would like to just briefly refer to the
maps which are attached to the briefs.

we have the
QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, is this the district

3

that the Florida supreme court approved, that we're

4

looking at now?

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

This -- what you're looking at is

6

the district that the Florida supreme court approved under

7

the duress of the Justice Department's letter.

8

QUESTION:

That's 4A of the brief?

Of the blue brief?
This is Appendix B to the brief on

the merits for appellant.
QUESTION:

Yes, and this is the one that was

superseded by the district that is now in question?
MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct.

This was the one

16

that was challenged by the plaintiff in his lawsuit, so

17

this is the one that was the result of the preclearance

18

denial letter by the Justice Department.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, I had a question about

20

the challenge and the choice of forum.

21

a decision of the Florida supreme court, and you come into

22

a Federal court to do that.

23

You are attacking

Was there not a means by which you could have

24

fought out your challenge to a district created by the

25

Florida supreme court in the Florida State system so you

1

wouldn't have the embarrassment of a Federal court being

2

faced with a decision of the Florida supreme court that it

3

was impelled to reject?

4

Could you have gotten a remedy by appealing to

5

the State system rather than running to the Federal

6

courts?

7

MR. SHAPIRO:

No, Your Honor, because this was a

8

challenge based on what the Justice Department had forced

9

the Florida supreme court - QUESTION:

10

But that doesn't tell me why you

11

couldn't say -- I mean, the Equal Protection Clause

12

governs the State of Florida, as it does the Nation.

13

couldn't you then go into the State court system, make

14

precisely the argument made in the Federal court?

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

Why

First of all, the Florida supreme

16

court did not reserve jurisdiction over this issue.

17

reserved jurisdiction when it approved this district in

18

597 So.2d.

19

court it says, we reserve jurisdiction.

20

approved 330 at the insistence of the Justice Department

21

it did not reserve jurisdiction.

But when it

I don't mean in that case.

23

case -- bring another case, in which you're saying,

you were acting under the gun of the Department of

1

Justice, so we want to free you from that thrall.
MR. SHAPIRO:

2

Well, Your Honor, the only thing I

3

can say is that the plaintiff had the right to contest

4

this district in U.S. district court, and under the Voting

5

Rights Act.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Shapiro, I appreciate that you

7

did, but there was a certain anomaly in you coming to a

8

Federal court to in effect override a decision of the

9

State court and then say that the Federal court has not

10

been sufficiently respectful of the State authorities.

11

Maybe you haven't in coming to the Federal court rather

12

than a State court for the solution to your problem.

13

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, that issue was resolved in

14

the trial court.

15

actually motions to dismiss filed by the Attorney General

16

in the State of Florida asserting that position.

17

were denied by the district court, and that was not

18

appealed.

There were motions -- there were

QUESTION:

19

Those

Do you think you would have had much

20

of a chance had you gone into a Florida trial court and

21

said that what the Florida supreme court did was a

22

mistake?

23

MR. SHAPIRO:

I don't know that a Florida trial

24

court would have jurisdiction in the Voting Rights Act

25

case, Your Honor.

I just don't know.

I don't think so.

1

I think this would be exclusive jurisdiction in

2

the Federal district court, and Mr. Lawyer had a right to

3

make a Shaw claim in the U.S. district court, and again,

4

there was a motion filed by the Attorney General to

5

abstain, to transfer because of the DeGrandy litigation,

6

which was in progress at the time.

7

plan was in U.S. district court in the Northern District.

10

QUESTION:

This district -- this

Mr. Shapiro, may I just clarify, is

anybody now claiming that plan should be defended?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, yes.

The -- in fact, and

11

that's a critical aspect of this case, is that the --at

12

no time in this litigation did -- was there ever an

13

adjudication that this plan was unconstitutional.

14
15
16
17

QUESTION:

I understand, but is anybody now

claiming that it is constitutional?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Yes, because what they're saying,

they reserve - -

18

QUESTION:

And if so, who?

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

The Attorney General -- I'm sorry.

20

The State appellants at the least, specifically in their

21

settlement agreement said, we do not acknowledge that 330

22

is unconstitutional, and we have a right -- if their

23

settlement plan was rejected, they retained the right to

24

contest that 330 was unconstitutional, and that's a key

25

aspect of this case, in that there was never an

adjudication of liability that that 330 -QUESTION:

2

3

they don't contest that it's unconstitutional.

4
5

Well, I thought in this Court though

MR. SHAPIRO:

I believe they do.

concede that 330 was unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

6

But how does that bear on the

7

arguments you're trying to make?

8

MR. SHAPIRO:

9
10

They do not

It doesn't bear on the arguments.

I do not -- they do not admit that 330 is
unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

11

But then, why don't we go to the

12

district which basically we're talking about here, I take

13

it.

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct.

This is 386.

15

This was the settlement plan that was approved by the

16

Federal court.

17

Now, you can see what happened with the map that

18

was produced at the "fairness hearing."

19

political subdivisions that are even included in this,

20

when you talk about disrespect for political subdivisions.

21

Here's Tampa Bay.

It's a huge body of water.

22

Although there's the shoreline which is depicted, it

23

doesn't really reflect which portion of Pinellas County --

24

Pinellas County is over here.

25

it's not on here.

You don't know that because

They chose this

Now, what they did was, they eliminated that

21

part that went over to Polk County, but they retained this

22

at the insistence of the Justice Department.

23

Now, if you look at this little spit of land

24

here, this was included as well, so it goes all the way

25

across, and if you look back at the plan that was

1

presented to the court, it looks like one contiguous

2

compact piece of land.

3
4

QUESTION:

But much of that is the lake, is what

you're saying.

5

MR. SHAPIRO:

6

QUESTION:

7

Yes, sir.

And you're suggesting that the judges

down there didn't know where Tampa Bay was.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, I don't know.

Judge Tjoflat

10

said, well, we assume there's no houseboats there.

11

what he said in -- at the fairness hearing.

12

13

That's

Well, there are no - - they have a lot of fish
there, and they don't vote.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

But as we -- as Mr. Lawyer made

16

clear this is only part of the picture though, the shape

17

of the map and irregular aspect of it.

18

19
20

QUESTION:

Is that unusual in Florida, to have a

district separated by a body of water?
MR. SHAPIRO:

Well, it is not unusual to be

21

separated by a body of water, but it's a totally different

22

proposition when there -- when a district has to be -- a

23

piece of land has to be in some district, say in an

24

island and the Florida supreme court stated this in their

25

original decision.

1

They said, look, in Florida there's a lot of

2

water, so just because a district encompasses water

3

doesn't necessarily make it noncontiguous.

4

It's another proposition for the district to

5

artificially reach over this huge body of water for the

6

specific exclusive purpose of including black voters in

7

order to boost the population of the entire district, and

8

that was the exact purpose of the designers of this plan,

9

was to go across at this highly dense black community in

10

Pinellas, where they had been in their own district.

11

In fact, it's truly emblematic of this case that

12

if you look at 21, whereas under their plan they presented

13

to the court, the number 21 was in yellow, now the two is

14

submerged in water, so it's -- so they have jumped across

15

Tampa Bay and taken these counties, which used to be in

16

other districts.

17

They were in other districts.

QUESTION:

But you're not claiming now, as I

18

think was the case in the earlier district, that they put

19

together rural areas with urban areas on both sides of the

20

rivers, or the bay?

21

MR. SHAPIRO:

No.

As a matter of fact, that was

22

eliminated, this finger, but when you create a monster,

23

you can cut the fingers off, it's still a monster.

24

This finger was cut off that led to Polk County,

25

which was rural, but the NAACP opposed the plan of joining

1

Pinellas County over here, because they said there's not

2

even a cohesive black community in the Tampa-Hillsborough

3

area, much less the Pinellas area.

4

They opposed it.

But what the Justice Department did was,

it

5

insisted that in order to create an additional majority

6

district, that they must join the populations.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. SHAPIRO:

9

I thought this wasn't a majority -It is not a majority, but the

purpose was to create a majority -QUESTION:

10

Why did the NAACP oppose it?

What

11

was - - why did they think that would harm the interests of

12

the black voters?
MR. SHAPIRO:

13

Because they -- they were correct.

14

This plan -- this is striking.

15

Pinellas County's blacks are now in plan 386.
Even more,

16

Sixty-four percent of all

74 percent of Manatee County's blacks

17

are in the plan, so they bleach -- and the NAACP said,

18

look, you're bleaching the surrounding areas of their

19

influence, because you're taking a pocket of black voters,

20

and you're forcing them into that plan where they don't

21

belong.

22

Now, the Justice Department --

23

QUESTION:

Before you leave that, may I just

24

ask, does the NAACP -- are they a party to the appeal?

25

They don't challenge it now, do they?

MR. SHAPIRO:

1

2

No.

They are not a party to this

appeal, and they were not involved in this litigation.

3

But when the -- here's the point.

When the

4

Florida supreme court considered the idea, at the

5

insistence of the Justice Department, that they cross

6

Tampa Bay to pick up this pocket of black voters, the

7

Florida supreme court in the 601 So.2d copy said, but

8

these - - this is not a compact group of black voters.

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, let me understand.

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

You're talking about the NAACP

13

opposition to the plan that the Florida supreme court

14

adopted, the one that we saw before with the finger --

15

MR. SHAPIRO:

16

QUESTION:

MR. SHAPIRO:

QUESTION:

NAACP opposes the plan that the - MR. SHAPIRO:

But we have nothing to say that the

-- and that was a concern with

No.

-- court approved, that the Federal

court approved.
MR. SHAPIRO:

No, we don't.

But those comments

that they made before the Florida supreme court are

directly relevant to this case, because they said -- they

2

said to the court they objected to any plan -- any plan

3

which would cross Tampa Bay and join these populations.

4
5

QUESTION:

But they objected because to do so

was packing.

6

MR. SHAPIRO:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And if the packing is now less, I

8

don't know that it follows that they still find it

9

objectionable.

10

You've only got -- your district is what,

30-some-odd percent black now?

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

12

QUESTION:

It's 36-percent black.

So I don't know that there -- I don't

13

know that we can infer that there's -- that they would

14

still object, when in fact they have not done so.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Or that it makes any difference

whether they object or not.
MR. SHAPIRO:

I'm just pointing that out to say

18

that there was a substantial -- that the Florida supreme

19

court was saying, we do not believe that we're obeying our

20

traditional neutral districting principles by doing this,

21

but we're doing it because under duress of the Justice

You shouldn't

No, of course.
-- why the NAACP would seem to be on

Well, could you explain what your

You say you never consented to this

QUESTION:

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct.
-- 386, and -We never consented to it.
-- that you've never agreed with it,

16

and that you did not get relief at the State level, and

17

you assert that the plan, 386, violates this Court's

18

constitutional standards.

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct, and it does so for

20

several reasons.

Number 1, this was called a hybrid

21

consent decree.

That's what the majority of the court

22

called this.

23

is you have to have consent.

The notion of the consent decree, however,

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's correct, and he objected to

an adjudication that 330 be declared unconstitutional.

He objected ad nauseam to 386, and he insisted upon

What the court did was, instead it made a

6

conscious decision that instead of actually adjudicating

7

330 unconstitutional, that it would submit the matter to

8

mediation, and the purpose of the mediation was to allow

9

the parties to come up with a remedy or a substitute plan.

10

The problem is, that does an end run around the

11

Florida legislature, which in the traditional cases that

12

this Court has said over and over and over, including

13

Miller, this Court has said it's the province of the State

14

legislature - -

QUESTION:

But is it not true that if there had

16

been a finding of violation, and then after hearings the

17

court had imposed this plan, you would still make

precisely the same objections you're making now?

19

MR. SHAPIRO:

20

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

But -- so if you win -- well, you

you're attacking the procedure, so even if this is a good

MR. SHAPIRO:

That's -- it's wrong on both

Now, what our position is on this case is that, as

QUESTION:

A Federal court can only order a

Here, there was never

Mr. Shapiro, since you are making

8

much of this point, Mr. Lawyer submitted a statement

9

together with Plaintiff Scott and others, a statement of

10

the case, representing to the district court as a result

11

of this Court's decision in the Miller case there are no

12

issues of law to be decided by the court in this matter.

13

Accordingly, the only issue which would remain for the

14

court to decide at the trial on this matter is the issue

15

of the appropriate remedy.

16

Now, it seems to me that your first point about

17

how the court has to declare the old district

18

unconstitutional, this is a stipulation that your client

19

joined and said, court, we all agree there's nothing for

20

you to decide but the remedy for this constitutional

21

violation.

MR. SHAPIRO:

By the remedy he meant how much

time -- this -- how much time the court should give the

Do you want

You appear to be here arguing that the procedure

followed by the Federal district court was erroneous

because it didn't first find unconstitutionality of plan

330, and furthermore it did not then await an opportunity

for the legislature to adopt its own plan,

argument centers on that.

1

That's not an accurate -- an adequate

2

application of Miller.

Instead of using the community of

3

interest analysis in Miller in looking at the actual

4

objective evidence in terms of what these communities are,

5

they held - - they used a fairness hearing as a referendum

6

and said, well, we're -- because we have a fairness

7

hearing and we've put a notice in the newspaper that

8

anybody who wants to contest 386 could come to the court

9

and do that, the court in this case, the district court

10

said, well, nobody showed up and objected to plan 386, so

11

therefore there must be a community of interest.

12

The statistics of the case are also important.

13

The statistics are that although 330 had 45 percent black

14

voters of V.A.P., this plan had 36 percent, so that a

15

significant number of black voters were moved from their

16

place over here in Pinellas County into District 21 when

17

they normally would not be there.

18

There was no - - and one of the key aspects is - -

19

I know I've harped on this, but in adopting the procedure

20

that the court used of using mediation in a secret

the plan used.

was --he was permitted to cross-examine the witness, but

there was no oral testimony at that - - there was no one

under oath, there was no oral testimony whatsoever at the

Did Mr. Lawyer have an opportunity to

examine, and was denied that opportunity?

MR. SHAPIRO:

He wasn't denied the right to call

MR. SHAPIRO:

At the fairness hearing.

So there was testimony taken there?
There was no testimony.

It was a

thing.

MR. SHAPIRO:

The next best thing, but he had no

burden to prove plan 386 was unconstitutional, because

decisions, that race did not predominate over, did not

subordinate other districting principles in the design of

the legislature an opportunity to convene,

MR. TARANTO:

I think what's going on here is

10

that there is -- by the time the summer of 1995 comes

11

around there is a very serious Federal challenge.

Authorized State officials I don't think are required or

should be stripped of the authority to resolve that

perfectly proper discretionary evidentiary ruling.
There is a general rule that says you don't make

3

a lawyer a witness in the case absent compelling need.

4

Before you've examined the man who drew the district,

5

before you've examined the State officials who actually

negotiated, you couldn't possibly show a compelling need,

7

and there was no showing of that sort by appellant.
Appellant was allowed to submit statistics,

allowed to submit a different plan, allowed to submit his

own maps, some of these maps -- he was invited to put on

decision in Local 93, it is very clear that once the other

parties to the case agreed on a decree, that couldn't --

that by itself couldn't adjudicate his rights, but he had

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto,

I'm prepared to accept

3

your analysis as far as whether the district, had it been

adopted by the legislature, would be unconstitutional.

5

My problem with this case is,

I think it's a

6

serious matter to say that when the Florida legislature as

7

a whole has not been put on notice that its existing

8

districting is unconstitutional, and has not been given an

9

opportunity after that notice to itself draw a district --

10

which might have been like this, but then again it might

11

not have -- it isn't enough for me that this district be

12

constitutional.

13

I also would like it to be the district that the

14

voters of Florida wanted to the extent that the Federal

15

court could have given them an opportunity to select it.
MR. TARANTO:

16

Your Honor,

I don't agree with

17

that rule, because I think that the proper Federalism rule

18

in this context is one that leaves it to State law what

19

officials have the authority to engage in what kind of

20

settlement of litigation, and that's what is undisputed

21

here.

These State officials -QUESTION:

The following is either in or was

who sent a letter ex parte to each of the three judges,

claim, and puts in place a new plan subject to any change

that the legislature wants to make, it needs to inquire

the State legislature and the State itself is concerned,

6

that counsel had a right to waive any finding of

7

unconstitutionality, and they did so, and the State had a

8

right to waive any opportunity to redraw a district, and

9

they did so.

Is that your position, in essence?

MR. TARANTO:

11

Thank you.

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

Thank you,

Mr. Taranto.
Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRVING L. GORNSTEIN

16

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLEE

17
18
19

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our position is that the settlement plan is

20

constitutional, and that the district court did not

21

violate any principles of Federalism in approving it.

22

On the constitutional question, I wanted to make

23

three points.

The first is that the district court

24

applied the correct legal standard in judging the

25

constitutionality of the proposed plan, that it correctly

1

drew from Miller the principle that a plan is subject to

2

strict scrutiny only when a challenger can show that race

3

predominated in the design of the district.

4

The second point I wanted to make is that

5

district court findings of predominant motive are governed

6

by the clearly erroneous standard of review, so that the

7

district court's finding in this case that District 21 was

8

not predominantly motivated by racial considerations is

9

subject to review in this Court only for clear error.

10

The final point I wanted to make on the

11

constitutional question is that the district court's

12

subsidiary findings show that its ultimate finding on

13

predominant motive is not clearly erroneous, and those

14

findings are that the district is sufficiently regular by

15

Florida standards to avoid any suggestion that race

16

predominated, that the district includes a genuine

17

community of interest, and that the district affords to

18

any candidate, without regard to race, the opportunity to

19

be elected.

20

Now, those findings are all supported by the

21

record and are together sufficient to support the district

22

court's ultimate finding that race did not predominate.

23

On the Federalism question, we think it was

24

entirely appropriate for the district court to resolve the

25

litigation without making a formal adjudication based on

the State's consent.

It would

it is one of the

principle reasons that parties enter into settlements, is
to avoid a formal adjudication, to avoid findings of
liability.
QUESTION:

Well, but how can it do so as against

somebody who didn't consent, to wit, the petitioner here?
How can it avoid some opportunity to have evidence put on
and conduct a full inquiry into the validity of plan 386?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

It certainly can have -- is

required for there to be an inquiry into the validity of
386.

What there was not required was an inquiry into the

validity of 330.
QUESTION:

Well, but the appellant is in the

position of suggesting that there be redistricting, or
that the old district be approved, and faces, as the court
faces, a difficult task in determining what are legitimate
criteria for districting?

What are community interests?

What are legislative preferences?
And it seems to me that the court must exercise
its discretion to have before it and to have available to
the parties the legislative policies, the legislative
determinations as to what legitimate district criteria
are, and by not referring this to the legislature and
accepting too quickly, perhaps, the representations of
State officials, the court and the appellant were deprived

of that data, that body of guidelines that are necessary

2

to make appropriate and legitimate districting

determinations.

4

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Well, I think that the

5

legislature did -- had ample opportunity to convene, and

6

to legislate a plan if it had wanted to.

7

It was faced with more than a very serious claim

8

under Miller, and I think everybody in the legislature

9

must have been aware that the Florida supreme court's plan

10

was extremely vulnerable, and still it did not convene in

11

legislative session, and instead what it did is, its

12

authorized representatives, the Speaker of the House and

13

the President of the Senate, are authorized to conduct

14

litigation, and they negotiated a settlement.
Now, the - - that settlement says that it shall

The ability of the Senate to

The answer comes, I assume there are some judges
somewhere who simply enjoy hearing evidence.

No.

Now, I take that to be a response that the

8

proponents did not have to put on live evidence, that they

9

could rely on the attachments.

I don't take that to be a

10

preclusion of the appellant or anyone else who would have

11

wanted an opportunity to present evidence at that hearing

12

to do that, and I think when we get to the evidence --

13

now, this is in the joint appendix at page 185, at the

14

remedial hearing.

The bottom of the page, Judge Tjoflat says, at

16

the very bottom, Mr. Hill has summarized in effect what is

hearing that there was a full chance to put on evidence

22

misunderstood that he was -- and thought he didn't have

that chance before, he could have said something about

He could have said, look, I didn't think that I was

going to get that chance.

I need more time.

He didn't

say anything like that.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gornstein, maybe you can explain

something to me about this record, because it does seem
that in the beginning the plaintiffs, everybody was trying
to settle this.

Everybody agreed that the plan was

vulnerable under -- the old plan under Miller, and there
was the stipulation that I read, and then there seemed at
some point there was -- this harmony that prevailed about,
let's stipulate, let's mediate, broke down, but it's not
clear to me how that happened.

Well, I think Mr. -- the

appellant in this case was not satisfied with the results
of mediation, and -QUESTION:

Yes.

I think that the rule that there should be no
precondition, that there -- it will always have to be a
liability finding is extremely important in facilitating
settlements, and it would disserve the principles of
Federalism, we would suggest, to make the States the only
parties who could not settle cases without either a formal
