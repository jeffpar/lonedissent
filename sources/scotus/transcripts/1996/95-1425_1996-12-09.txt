ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL APPELLANT

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On remand from this Court's decision in Miller

13

v. Johnson, the three-judge court, after waiting

14

unsuccessfully for the Georgia legislature to enact a new

15

apportionment plan, created a plan of its own, a plan with

16

one majority-minority district in Metropolitan Atlanta.

17

In its opinion, and this is at page 21a of the

18

jurisdictional statement, the district court concluded

19

that "if Georgia had a concentrated minority population

20

large enough to create a second majority-minority district

21

without subverting traditional districting principles, the

22

court would have included one, since Georgia legislatures

23

probably would have done so."

24
25

The illustrative plan that we submitted to the
district court in November of last year, which is

reprinted at page 44a of the jurisdictional statement,

2

demonstrates, in fact, that a reasonably compact majority

3

black district can be drawn in East Central Georgia

4

without neglecting, subverting, or subordinating Georgia's

5

traditional districting principles and, thus, the district

6

court erred in two independent and fundamental respects:

7

First, by failing to respect, as Upham v. Seamon

8

and White v. Weiser require, the Georgia legislature's

9

desire, expressed in word and in deed, for a second

10

majority-minority district in East Central Georgia and,

11

second, regardless of the legislature's intent, by failing

12

to recognize that on the record as it existed before the

13

district court at the time, section 2 of the Voting Rights

14

Act required creation of a second district in East Central

15

Georgia to remedy unlawful vote dilution.

16

Now, the appellants have --

17

QUESTION:

Actually, in your brief you said that

18

the question was whether or not it was proper to reduce

19

the majority black districts from three to one, but that

20

begins with a premise based on an unconstitutional plan,

21

does it not?

22

MR. WAXMAN:

That would -- that argument

23

would -- would indeed, Justice Kennedy, and I think that

24

where you - -

in your brief.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, in our -- in the section 5

3

portion of our brief, which is not an argument that we had

4

noted in - - a point that we had noted in our

5

jurisdictional statement but since it was raised by the

6

coappellants we addressed it, in the section 5 analysis

7

you would start with the 1992 plan.

8

In the Upham v. Seamon --

9

QUESTION:

Why would you begin with an

10

unconstitutional premise?

11

your summary of argument. You're contesting a plan that

12

reduces from three to one

13

MR. WAXMAN:

14

QUESTION:

15

That's the opening statement in

Yes --- but you begin with an

unconstitutional premise.

16

MR. WAXMAN:

I understand your point.

17

Under Upham v. Seamon and White v. Weiser, a

18

district court, when remedying an unconstitutional plan

19

enacted by the legislature, must make the minimum number

20

of changes to remedy the constitutional violation, but

21

otherwise adhere to the expressed intent and desire and

22

policies of the State legislature.

23

In this case - -

24

QUESTION:

25

But the minimum number of changes in

the case of three majority black districts in which two

1

are unconstitutional, the minimum number of changes are to

2

eliminate the two that are unconstitutional, I would

3

think.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, the issue, I submit, Justice

5

Scalia, is whether it is possible -- given the Georgia

6

legislature's expressed desire for a second majority-

7

minority district if one were possible consistent with

8

traditional districting principles -QUESTION:

9
10

MR. WAXMAN:

11

QUESTION:

That expressed desire --- whether it is possible to do it.
-- the court found was expressed --

12

you might call it an extracted desire.

13

because of the Justice Department's insistence --

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

QUESTION:

That is --- that an additional black district

16

be drawn.

17

to this conclusion on its own.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

It was expressed

It's not as though the Georgia legislature came

Justice Scalia.

I respectfully disagree with you,

What the district --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Not with me, but with the court.
What the district court found was

22

that the 1992 plan, which is the plan reflecting three

23

districts, was the product of improper and

24

unconstitutional Justice Department pressure.

25

The original plan enacted by the Georgia

1

legislature in 1991, which we refused to preclear, had two

2

majority-minority districts, and when this case was

3

before - -

4

QUESTION:

And the court did not say that that

5

plan also had been affected by Justice Department

6

pressure?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

To the contrary.

The court -- I

8

believe the court's opinion makes a point of saying that

9

it was error for us not to have approved that plan because

10

it was proper and not regressive.
QUESTION:

11

In fact --

That's a different point from whether

12

the Justice Department, pressure from the Justice

13

Department had induced the legislature to include the

14

second.

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Let me, if I may, Justice Scalia,

16

repeat for you what counsel for the State of Georgia told

17

this Court at the outset of his argument in Miller v.

18

Johnson:

19

"There was a consensus politically before the

20

Department of Justice ever got involved in the State of

21

Georgia to try and draw a majority-minority district in

22

East Central Georgia, no question about that fact."

23

3 of the transcript in Miller v. Johnson.

24
25

Page

And there is extensive evidence in the record to
support that conclusion.

QUESTION:

1

That proves nothing, Mr. Waxman.

It

2

just proves -- I mean, the political consensus could have

3

been a consensus, look, if we don't put in at least one

4

more majority-minority district, this thing will never be

5

precleared by the Justice Department.
The issue is not whether there is a consensus.

6

7

The issue is whether, as you portray it, the uncoerced

8

desire of the Georgia legislatures was to have this second

9

district.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I would respectfully submit,

11

Justice Scalia, that the district court found as fact,

12

based on the evidence before it, that the Georgia

13

legislature would have wanted to create a second majority-

14

minority district in East Central Georgia if to do so

15

would not subvert traditional districting principles --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. --- and I respectfully suggest that

18

the court erred in enacting its plan because the

19

illustrative plan we've provided to the Court demonstrates

20

that that can be done.

21

The district court's finding in that regard,

22

Justice Scalia, I think is entitled to review under the

23

clear error standard.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, is it your position now

that the 1991 plan which had the two districts was

1

unconstitutional at least with respect to one of those

2

districts,

3

has two districts that should have been the one adopted?

4

and therefore it's the illustrative plan that

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

I believe that in light of

5

this Court's decision,

subsequent decision in Miller v.

6

Johnson and its decisions thereafter in Bush v. Vera and

7

Shaw v. Hunt,

8

clearly expressing the legislature's intent for a second

9

district in this area,

the legislature's 1991 plan,

although

would violate this Court's

10

decisions because it is an extremely irregular, bizarre

11

district.

12

The district that we have drawn in this case has

13

no arms,

no tentacles,

no claws,

no land bridges;

14

doesn't reflect any effort to go around certain racial

15

populations to reach others.

MR. WAXMAN:

2

QUESTION:

I can point to it if I -The illustrative plan, and Bibb

3

County is toward the north of section 2, and you split

4

Columbus in order to make up section 2, and that's to pick

5

up black population, and in Bibb County, which is number

6

11, you split Macon --

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes.
-- in order to get a black

population.
MR. WAXMAN:

10

It is correct that in our plan we

11

retain completely intact 148 out of the 150 counties of

12

Georgia outside -QUESTION:

13
14

And it just so happens that the

counties you split are split along white-black lines.
MR. WAXMAN:

15

Well, there is -- Justice Kennedy,

16

there is actually nothing in the record that reflects why

17

or precisely how our illustrative plan divides it, except

18

to - -

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

It just happened that way?
Well, if I may finish, Your Honor,

21

what -- the only thing the record itself reflects is that

22

we divided those same jurisdictions as did the legislature

23

in its original 1991 plan.

24
25

Now, if I may go further, because -- I think
because the district court drew its own plan, even though
11

1

it's not in the record it would be appropriate for me to

2

answer Your Honor's question about why we divided the

3

counties the way we did and how we divided it, because I

4

think it really does go to the question of whether, under

5

this Court's opinion in Miller v. Johnson, race was the

6

predominant reason.

7

So let me go forward, because I think the

8

district court, in drawing its own plan, took this into

9

account and answered that question.

10

Muscogee County was divided for three reasons.

11

Number 1, to keep Fort Benning, which splits -- which is

12

in Muscogee County, intact in one district.

13

did that, too, and also to comply with one-person one-

14

vote requirements and lower the overall deviation between

15

the second district and the other districts.

The 1991 plan

Bibb and Macon - - Bibb County and Macon was

16
17

divided

18

under one-person one-vote, and to include as much of it as

19

possible --

both in order to achieve population equality

QUESTION:

20
21

Macon is the county seat of Bibb

County?
MR. WAXMAN:

22

Yes -- and to include as much of it

23

as possible with the rest of the African American

24

concentration in the region and to be consistent with the

25

1991 plan.

(800) FOR DEPO

In point of fact, the area included in our

1

2

illustrative district is 80 percent of all the population

3

in Macon and includes substantial areas that are almost

4

entirely white, and in point of further fact, the mayor

5

and the city council of Macon unanimously supported

6

division of the county and city into more than one

7

district.
QUESTION:

8

9

Counsel, one question I had about the

DOJ illustrative plan is that apparently it was not ever

10

put on computer to show precincts and rather, it used,

11

what, census tracts or something?

12

MR. WAXMAN:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
And so how did the district court

14

know that if it had been put on computer for precincts

15

that those numbers would have panned out?

16

could have required a lot more adjusting and splitting to

17

do the job ultimately.
MR. WAXMAN:

18

It perhaps

Justice O'Connor, the district

19

court didn't --we submitted the plan using precincts

20

because that was what was on our computer at the time.

21

The - -

QUESTION:

23

precincts, I think.

You mean census tracts, not

24

MR. WAXMAN:

Using census tracts.

25

We subsequently obtained the precinct data both

1

for 1992 and now in 1996, and the plan is almost exactly

2

the same, because the precinct lines in Georgia very

3

carefully follow census tracts, and --

4

QUESTION:

But it wasn't ever given to the

5

district court, and I guess we have to ask whether it

6

abused its discretion, and I just wasn't really sure --

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Well --- whether it would be an abuse of

discretion to not consider or adopt an illustrative plan
that didn't have those closer figures in - MR. WAXMAN:

11

Well, I would respectfully suggest,

12

Justice O'Connor, that it was an abuse of discretion at

13

least not to wait for it and give us the opportunity, or

14

try and find out whether a plan that was submitted only

15

for illustrative purposes could, in fact, be drawn in that

16

fashion using precincts.

17

The district court did not hold a hearing after

18

we submitted our illustrative plan.

1

question?
All of this would be irrelevant if the district

2

3

judge was right when he said creating a second majority-

4

minority district -- this is 21a of your appendix -- would

5

require the court to engage in the unconstitutional -- in

6

unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.

7

That sentence seems to be saying, if you start

8

out with the purpose of creating a majority-minority

9

district, then no matter how neat and tidy it is, it's no

10
11

good.
MR. WAXMAN:

Well, if that conclusion were a

12

correct conclusion of law, that's right, but that is --

13

that test which the court applied is not, in fact, the

14

test that this Court has adopted in Miller v. Johnson and

15

Bush v. Vera, which is that it is -- this Court has stated

16

that a legislature may take race into account, and may

17

create, intentionally create majority-minority districts

18

without incurring strict scrutiny if race was not the

19

predominant reason, which is to say that the plaintiff

20

must prove -- if the plaintiff can prove that the

21

legislature subordinated, substantially disregarded, or

22

neglected traditional race-neutral districting principles.

23

And what we have here, with respect to the

24

eleventh district in our illustrative plan, is a district

25

which on five of the six traditional principles that the

or better than the court's plan.

3

With respect to one factor -- that is, splitting

county lines -- in one little portion of this district we

split one county line in order to include as much of Bibb

County as Macon as possible with the rest of the

concentrated African American population in East Central

Georgia, and we submit --

QUESTION:

But the district judge seemed to

10

think that if race is the driving force, then it is the

11

predominant force, even if other factors are accommodated.

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I can't speak beyond what the

13

court's opinion was, what the district court thought.

14

cannot reconcile the district court's conclusion in this

15

case with the articulation of the law that this Court has

16

set forth in Miller v. Johnson and Bush v. Vera.

17

May I reserve the balance of my time?

Well, Your Honor, the litigants

18

before this Court are seeking an end to the litigation, I

19

assume, and they are asking for an affirmance, but the

20

general assembly itself clearly articulated what the State

21

policy was in 1991, when it enacted the first plan.

22

So we should accept your version of

23

what the general assembly wanted rather than the

representatives of the State?

instructive to see what these litigants said on page 2 of

2

their brief.

3

They explained during the remedy phase of the

4

case they had elected not to submit a proposed

5

redistricting plan to the district court, and the reason

6

that they took that position was, they were not

7

authorized, they said, to state what the legislature's

8

policy was, so these litigants don't pretend to be

9

surrogates for the general assembly.

10

They've disavowed,

in fact, that they have that authority.
QUESTION:

11

Well, the problem is, I guess, that

12

the district court found as a factual matter here that the

13

plan passed by the Georgia legislature in '91 and then

14

their efforts after that did not represent State policy,

MR. MCDONALD:

That's correct.

And it's interesting, you want us to

go back to a presumed legislative intent that did not

obtain preclearance and there was a second legislative

6

7

please, and the legislature says well, we can't.
MR. MCDONALD:

8

Then the

The first plan was objected to,

9

but it was not objected to, Your Honor, on the grounds

10

that it contained two majority black districts, so the

11

Department of Justice has not objected to that feature of

12

it, and this Court expressly found that that feature of it

13

would not violate the retrogression principle a second

14

time.

15

As a practical matter the court -- the litigants

16

in this case want to say that John Dunne was a bad guy and

17

that he had coerced and terrified the State, but in point

18

of fact, Your Honor, the reason the State made a

19

conscious, deliberate decision to adopt two majority black

20

districts is based on a myriad of facts and circumstances.

21

I mean, one has to remember that there's a very

22

large black membership in the general assembly, and those

23

legislators were urging the State to adopt an additional

24

majority-minority congressional district, so that was part

25

of what was going on in the general assembly.

But one also has to see what sort of trauma the

attempting to preclear this congressional plan, because

Augusta because they knew that they would be potential

candidates, and if the 1972 plan was bad enough, the 1982

12

congressional redistricting plan in Georgia was an

13

absolute total embarrassment and humiliation for the State

14

of Georgia.

15

It had nothing to do with John Dunne or the

16

Department of Justice, but the D.C. court denied

17

preclearance to the 1982 plan because they said the State

18

had deliberately fragmented the concentration of the

minority population in the Atlanta area and it accused

Ladle, the person in the general assembly, in the House,

who was chair of the redistricting committee, who was the

chief architect of the plan, and said he was a "racist",

urging upon this Court as mandated by section 2 of the

I think the Justice Department would say no,

there's no room.

There's a perfect congruence between

where this Court has left off in Johnson v. Miller and

that the '91 plan, with its feature of two such districts,

State's desires, is that correct?

It is valid in some respects,

5

Your Honor, but as the district court found in its order,

6

and it's stated in footnote 9, which is at page 13a of the

district that existed in the '91 plan for the eleventh

I have about the way the standard should be set.

If we

something like a least change principle, an Upham and

Seamon principle, should the burden be on a district court

7

like this to find that it is impossible to draw districts

8

which come any closer to whatever the benchmark is?
So that in this case, I take it if that were the

10

principle we would say, the opinion of the three-judge

11

court has a hole in it here, because -- and the hole is,

12

it did not find that it was impossible, consistent with

13

the first Miller case and normal districting principles,

14

to come any closer to a two-district scheme than it did.

15

Would that - - is my principle right about how we

16

should apply Upham and Seamon, and number 2, if that's the

way we should apply it, is there a defect in what the

district court did here?

GENERAL BOWERS:

I think the principle you

your answer to Justice Scalia, that there are a number of

factors, presumably, which make up the 1991 redistricting

that the district court is obliged to consider that along

If the answer to that

10

that in 1991, and if you believe people should in fact in

leeway, then why shouldn't the judge here have tried to

Now, the Solicitor General also referenced the

oral argument of the State of Georgia in Miller I, and

they did say that it was the legislative policy to create

The facts, in a nutshell, are the reality of

diversity in the delegation was a policy choice the

districts.

12

critical point that ties in with the importance of State

that the appellants really are foreclosed from that

deviations far in excess of what the court plan offered.

Their plan, with the exception of the

We cannot put this down to a
We have an average

deviation here of 328 people in districts that total

The deviation argument here --

That's not the absolute --

MR. PARKS:

That's the difference between the

QUESTION:

Yes, but that -- it's about 3,000 --

21

the court's plan is about 3,000 from a zero variation, is

22

it not?

23

MR. PARKS:

If you added all eleven districts

up, the court's plan is better in four districts, the

25

DOJ's plan is better in five districts, and they tied on

It came down to a .11 variation for the court's plan

What's happening here, and this speaks to 2000,
