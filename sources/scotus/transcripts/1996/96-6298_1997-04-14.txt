CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 96-6298, Aaron Lindh v. James P. Murphy.
Mr. Liebman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LIEBMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court granted review of a single issue,

11

whether the court of appeals properly denied Aaron Lindh's

12

1992 habeas petition based on a 1996 amendment to 28

13

U.S.C. section 2254(d).

14

The court below interpreted that amendment to

15

require it to leave intact State court decisions believed

16

to be wrong under the Constitution as long as they are not

17

"gravely wrong."

18

interpretation, but accept it here in addressing the

19

different issue before the Court.

20

Mr. Lindh ardently opposes that

I'll make two points.

First, because the

21

statute's express delineation of the pending cases to

22

which new habeas provisions shall apply omits Mr. Lindh's

23

pending case, the statute makes itself inapplicable here,

24

and thus disposes of the case under Landgraf's Step 1, and

25

also, therefore, under its clear congressional intent,

Second,

interpretation of section 2254(d)

that previously had given Lindh an unconditional right to

to attach a new legal

the denial of relief,

In Landgraf in 1994,

to preenactment events

the Court repeatedly urged

Congress to exercise responsibility for fundamental policy

10

judgments concerning the temporal reach of statutes,

11

Landgraf held that where Congress'

12

temporal reach is clear,

13

judgments will govern, but that otherwise the courts will

14

follow the timeless and universal rule against applying

15

new laws to have retroactive effects.

That is, against

It made any exception, did it not,

for jurisdictional rules?
MR. LIEBMAN:

Your Honor,

I don't think that

21

there is an exception under Step 2 per se for

22

jurisdictional rules.

23

so

What the Court said was that jurisdiction

24

oftentimes is the kind of change that does not attach new

25

legal consequences to preenactment events.

The reason is

1

that in all of the court's jurisdictional retroactivity

2

cases where Congress didn't specify the outcome it wanted,

3

there was an alternative forum that remained, and so it

4

wasn't a question of whether you've got to enforce your

5

rights.

6

be allowed to enforce your rights in.

It was simply a question of which forum you would

This case is very different, because here there

8

is no alternative remedy.
QUESTION:

9

There is no --

Well, Mr. Liebman, what rights are we

10

talking about, the Sixth Amendment right to confront

11

witnesses?

12

MR. LIEBMAN:

No.

The rights that we're talking

13

about, Your Honor, are the statutory rights under

14

2241(c)(3).

15

QUESTION:

All right, so you're not relying on

16

Lindh's right to confront witnesses, but just the

17

statutory right to habeas relief.

18

talking about.

19

MR. LIEBMAN:

That's all you're

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

20

What we are talking about here having become unconditional

21

and matured before the statute went into effect was a

22

statutory cause of action for relief upon the proof of two

23

statutory elements of that cause of action,

1

the Chief Justice's question a moment ago about there

2

being no alternative forum here, so that the

3

jurisdictional analysis was inapposite.

4
5
6

Why wasn't there an alternative forum simply in
the direct method of appeal in the first instance?
MR. LIEBMAN:

There are three answers to that,

7

Your Honor.

8

stand on is that there is no remaining effective and

9

substantial alternative.

10

11
12

First of all, the principle that I want to

That's the language from the

Crane v. Halo case.
There are three reasons, therefore, why the
State process does not provide an alternative and

3

significant or satisfactory remedy.

4

the -- ever since this Court's case in

5

Royale the understanding has been that the violation is

6

the leaving intact, the emplacement and leaving intact of

7

custody by the entire State judicial system as a whole.

8
9

The first one is that
886 in Ex parte

And so you cannot make what is part of the
violation into a sufficient remedy for the violation,

20

because it is as if in the Landgraf case someone were to

21

say to Mrs. Landgraf that because she had tried to get

22

relief from her employer and the employer had thought

23

about it and said you weren't discriminated against, you

24

wouldn't make that a sufficient remedy, and it's the same

25

thing here.

Part of the violation includes the entire

1

State court process leading to incarceration.
Secondly, to the extent that the direct appeal

2

3

process provides an alternative remedy, it is a remedy by

4

certiorari to this Court at the end of that direct review

5

process, a remedy that Mr. Lindh was lulled into passing

6

up, because at the time it was neither his last nor his

7

best option available for plenary Federal review.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, that may go to his judgment,

and it may have been a perfectly sensible judgment to make

10

at the time, but it doesn't go to the question whether

11

there is an alternative to the particular kind of review

12

sought, which I assume is a question about the system

13

rather than about his particular judgment.

14

MR. LIEBMAN:

Well, let me give the third

15

reason, Your Honor, because I think it speaks directly to

16

that.

17

Court spoke about a number of congressional statutes that

18

take away the res judicata defense and allow, for example,

19

soldiers on duty to reopen litigation that was concluded

20

against them.

21

In the Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm case in 1995, the

Now, let's assume that Congress decided to

22

change that statute and to say, no, there is going to be a

23

res judicata defense, but it's only going to be a res

24

judicata defense insofar as the judgment that you're

25

challenging was gravely wrong.

1

Now, under this Court's cases it is very clear

2

that this Court would not take away a soldier's existing

3

and accrued right of action under this statute as it

4

existed under a new establishment of a defense that was

5

established --

6

QUESTION:

Well, assuming that to be true,

7

you're also assuming an analogy which may well be sound,

8

but I guess it's not self-evidently sound, and that is

9

that the cause of action that you would be speaking of in

10

your example is the same -- is a cause of action in the

11

same sense that there is a cause of action in habeas, and

12

habeas is kind of a mongrelized cause of action.

13

Yes, it is a means of coming into court under a

14

specific Federal statute, but it's also in fact a means of

15

review for error as an alternative to another means of

16

review for error.

17

When somebody in direct appeal, for example,

18

takes an appeal, we don't think of that person as having a

19

cause of action to appeal, and so I suppose the so-called

20

habeas cause of action is in that sense a different kind

21

of cause of action from the one that you're referring to

22

in your example, and I guess my question is, why as a

23

matter of categorization or characterization should we

24

refer to the habeas remedy as involving a cause of action

25

in that classic sense.

MR. LIEBMAN:

1

Well, Your Honor, first of all,

2

I'm not sure it makes a difference whether you see this as

3

a new element of the cause of action, or the establishment

4

of a new defense, or as the dramatic changing of the

5

standard of review, if you want to think of it that way.
Now, I think that it is much more appropriate to

6

7

look at the post-enactment statute as one creating a new

8

standard of review, but it does set up a chain of courts

9

and tells -- in 2254(d) it says, look back to the State

10

court and review that State court decision.
The statute never before had said that, and so

11
12

under the statute as it previously existed, the rights

3

that were given and accrued under the previous statute,

4

there wasn't a standard of review kind of approach.
But even, Your Honor, if it was a new standard

5
6

of review, the lower court cases are unanimous on the

7

question that the imposition of a new standard of review

8

is like the imposition of a ■-

position, I gather, that Congress could not render that

2

action applicable to causes of action that arose before

3

the statute was passed?
MR. LIEBMAN:

4

Not at all, Your Honor.

If

5

Congress said specifically we want this to apply to prior

6

judgments that had been entered as to which there was an

7

accrued and existing right to appeal, that would be

different, but if Congress did not say that, if Congress

QUESTION:

22

But it's quite different, it seems to

me, for Congress to require the courts to reexamine

was Plaut.

MR. LIEBMAN:

QUESTION:

Well

And Congress to say on the other

3

hand, what's been decided we're going to leave alone, and

4

we don't want any more appeals.

5

MR. LIEBMAN:

6

QUESTION:

7

Yes.

I don't think the latter is an

interference with the judicial function.
MR. LIEBMAN:

8

9

That's quite different.

Your Honor, I didn't mean to

appeal to Plaut as a precedent.

I simply meant to appeal

10

to it as a compendium in a place in the statue of a number

11

of statutes of a certain type to which I was drawing the

12

analogy.
But let me be very clear in answer to Justice

13
14

Souter's question.

15

the Gasperini case, but there's a whole series of cases --

16

Byrd and Stoner -- this Court has confronted the question

17

of whether a different standard of review applied in the

18

Federal courts and the State courts has Erie consequences.

19

Is it substantive?

20

the legal -- the law that applies in the two sets of

21

courts?

22

In this Court, including last term in

Is it the kind of thing that changes

And in those cases this Court has consistently

23

said, using what is in effect a new legal consequences

24

analysis, it's saying, are there new legal consequences

25

attached to the forum that you pick?

Here it's the new

1

legal consequence attached to a temporal kind of criteria,

2

but the analysis there makes very clear that standards of

3

review are treated as substantive, as defining the

4

substantive rights, and as changing the law.
QUESTION:

5

Mr. Liebman, those Erie cases are

6

consistent within that context, but surely not everything

7

that would be labeled substantive for Erie is substantive

8

for other purposes.
MR. LIEBMAN:

9

Your Honor, I don't mean to

10

suggest there's a one-to-one relationship.

11

trying to point out that the Court has recognized,

12

including in the Gasperini case, that you get new law, a

3

I'm simply

new set of legal outcomes.

4

In a sense, what you -- what the law had

5

promised you in the state courts, if it instead is brought

6

in the Federal courts you get something different, and it

7

is exactly that that I'm pointing -- that I'm referring

8

to.

9

In answer to Justice Scalia's point, I want to

20

go back to those very statutes that you refer to, a series

21

of statutes running from

22

and through the judges' bill in

23

875 to

89 , the Everetts act,
925, and up through

988.

In all of those statutes where Congress switched

24

this Court's preexisting appeal, or writ of error

25

jurisdiction to a certiorari jurisdiction, in each one of

1

those it both -- it did two things.

First of all, it said

2

any case in the Supreme Court at the time the statute was

3

passed will proceed under the prior statute.

4

Secondly, it said that any case that had reached

5

a final judgment -- that is, in which there was an accrued

6

and existing right to an appeal or writ of error at the

7

time the new statute came into effect would be given a

8

long period of time, often 6, 7, 8 months, to get into the

9

Supreme Court under the old law, so that you'd have your

10

11

appeal or your writ of error.
So even Congress seems to understand that even

12

if it is a chain of courts connected with one kind of

13

review versus another, that if you had an accrued, an

14

existing right to the review because you had a final

15

judgment against you, that you had --

16

QUESTION:

What is your test --

17

QUESTION:

You could say -- I mean, arguably

18

that's one conclusion you could draw from the fact that

19

Congress said that.

20

that Congress realized that if it didn't say that, appeal

21

would have been cut off automatically, that it had to say

22

that in order to preserve it.

23

The other conclusion you can draw is

MR. LIEBMAN:

The Supreme Court, this Court

24

itself has said the same thing in those cases that I

25

referred to, the jurisdiction cases.

There's the McCardle

13

1

case, there's Crane v. Halo.

2

looked to see whether there was an existing efficient and

3

substantial alternative remedy that remained before it was

4

deemed to be appropriate, unless Congress specified, or to

5

overcome constitutional problems, as in McCardle, to cut

6

off that right completely, and so --

7

QUESTION:

In those cases the Court

The reference to an alternative forum

8

in McCardle is pretty much of an afterthought in the last

9

paragraph of the opinion, isn't it?
MR. LIEBMAN:

10

Well, it has been vindicated, of

11

course.

12

corpus context at that point and then, of course, it was

13

vindicated again in a sense, or at least as a way of

14

avoiding a constitutional issue last year in your --

15

It was vindicated a few years later in the habeas

QUESTION:

I thought you -- I thought we just

16

had a discussion in which you say you're not relying on

17

any constitutional problems here.

18

MR. LIEBMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

All I --

I mean, I don't see this as a

McCardle case at all.
MR. LIEBMAN:

No.

In answer to Chief Justice

22

Rehnquist's question I just wanted to point out that in

23

McCardle the -- they got -- obviously, there Congress

24

wanted to withdraw the jurisdiction, but there still was a

25

constitutional question of whether you could do it, and it

1

is consistent in that case that the Court said, well,

2

look, there is an alternative remedy.
That just places it within, as well, the Court's

3
4

retroactivity cases, where there isn't a constitutional

5

problem.

6

from applying it in the past, and what the Court did in

7

those cases was to say, it's okay to withdraw this forum,

8

but let's make sure that there is an alternate and equally

9

efficient remedy that is available.

10

There's simply a policy problem that would arise

QUESTION:

What -- do you have a way of saying

11

in a sentence or two what your standard for determining

12

which procedures are determinative of the change of

13

consequence -- you know, the language from Landgraf?

14

What's worrying me is every procedural change,

15

every rule of evidence, any change anyone can think of in

16

the court system is going to change the result in respect

17

to some category of people.

18

MR. LIEBMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Your Honor --

And of course, that's determinative

of legal consequence.
They say, don't look at it that way.

Look at

22

actions in the world.

Does it change the consequence of

23

actions of the world legally?

24

Does it change that, whether the person goes to prison or

25

not because of a violation of -- no.

No.

Look at remedies.

Then look at

procedures, and procedures don't -- that's the kind of way

2

I think they want us to look at it.

3

Now, you're saying, no, look at those

4

procedures.

5

consequences attached to actions, others don't.

your test?

7

Some procedural changes do change legal

MR. LIEBMAN:

What's

The test, Your Honor, is when a

8

Congress provides a standard and the intent of that

9

standard is systematically to change the outcomes in a

10

series of cases in favor of one of the litigants, sets of

11

litigants to that action, and against --

12

QUESTION:

So if, in fact, there were two levels

3

of an administrative review, including three levels within

4

the agency and two in court later on, and maybe three, and

5

Congress said, I'm going to take away one level of

review -- why are you doing it?

individual is just delaying things too long.

We think this kind of

Then you would say, because they have four
levels of review instead of five, that that then fits the
Landgraf test?
MR. LIEBMAN:

No.

No, Your Honor.

If I

22

conveyed that impression I didn't mean that at all.

has to do with Congress' effort systematically to change

the outcome of the legal rights at the end of the process.

question is yes, if there's an administrative procedure,

and by looking at it you see that this procedural change

was designed to help one group or one side versus the

21

other, then it's substantive.

22

MR. LIEBMAN:

That is your test.

Well, if the statute were to say,

for purposes of limiting the number of social security

claimants who receive relief, yes, that would be it.

QUESTION:

MR. LIEBMAN:

Therefore we

yes, that would be --

The answer is yes.

MR. LIEBMAN:

QUESTION:

Yes.

That would be --

Mr. Liebman, you've explained the one

side of it, what would be subject to the ordinary rule of

apply to the case wherever it is?

Can you describe the other category, these

MR. LIEBMAN:

There are two aspects to this

under the Landgraf rule.

21

any right has matured and become unconditional.

22

question is whether -- the second question is whether that

23

has happened before the statute went into effect.

The first question is whether

1

case, injunctions are decided by conditions as they exist

2

on the ground at the moment the court ruled.

3

American Steel Foundry says.

4

That's what

So if a case is filed and the court's trying to

5

decide whether or not to grant an injunction, and in the

6

middle of that, but before the injunction is ruled on, a

7

statute changed -- changes, that becomes another one of

8

the factors that is on the ground at the time the court

9

rules, and it would be considered at the time the court

10

ruled, because there was at that point no accrued and

11

unconditional right to an injunction because injunctions

12

are always up in the air and unstable and unsettled until

13

the point that the court rules.

14

To give another example, the -- one of the

15

amicus briefs refers to the change in 1919 where the

16

harmless error rule was adopted by statute.

17

that time, this Court had applied its own harmless error

rule consistent with the one put in the statute but a

19

number of courts of appeals had stopped following it and

20

were reversing on technical error.

21

Well, before

Well, at that point, when the new statute was

22

passed it was applied immediately in those cases, the

23

reason being that there was no matured and unconditional

right to relief on technical errors until the Supreme

2

3

Mr. Liebman, can I ask you about the

four corners of the instrument to which you're appealing?

4

One of your arguments, indeed, your first

5

argument, I guess the one you rely on most, is that since

6

Chapter 154 in its last provision says that it shall apply

7

to cases pending on or after the date of enactment of this

8

act -- that's on A-31 of the appendix to your blue brief.

9

Since that is in Chapter 154, the implication is that that

10

is not applicable to 15 -- Chapter 153.
What do you do, then, with the various

11
12

provisions in Chapter 154 that rely on amended Chapter

13

153?

14

section 2264(b), it says, following review, subject to

15

subsections (a),

16

shall rule on the claims properly before it, but according

17

to you there will not be review subject to subsections

18

(a),

19

those cases pending at the time, because those provisions

20

will not apply to those cases pending at the time.

21

For example, on page A-25 of your appendix, in

(d), and (e) of section 2254, the Court

(d), and (e) of section 2254 because -- at least for

MR. LIEBMAN:

No, Your Honor, actually 2264(b)

22

in some senses is our strongest point, and let me try and

23

explain why.

All Chapter 153 provisions apply in all habeas
cases, all State prisoner habeas cases.

Chapter 154 only

applies in capital opt-in cases.

2

if the Chapter 153 provisions were to apply to pending

3

cases, the provision you read, 2464(b), would be

superfluous, because it would say, in a set of cases in

of the Chapter 153 provisions.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

which limits the circumstances in which the Federal court

enactment.
It applies to cases pending on the date of

7

It's reviewing the

In that sense also it is forward-looking.

It's

8

injunctive in the sense that the right to habeas relief is

9

a right for the custody to end.

It does not go back and

10

give damages if the petitioner had been confined

11

unconstitutionally for 20 years, he does not get damages

12

for that.

13

It imposes no liability against the State in

14

that sense, but rather it ends the custody.

15

forward you are released from custody unless the State

16

retries you, so it is forward-looking in that sense, and

17

in that sense, until the Federal court has reached that

determination of whether it will order that custody shall

cease or not, 2254(d) is not applying backwards in any

sense.
QUESTION:

21

From this day

Ms. Wellman, on that point I am

22

confused.

I thought that there's a big difference between

23

an injunction, which is indeed prospective, from this day

24

forward, and habeas, which says, you should not be where

25

you are.

It's, I thought, backward-looking, because you

MS. WELLMAN:

6

There's no

So it seems to me habeas is

It is in that sense, but it is not

7

backward-looking in the sense of tort action, in that the

8

remedy to a person or the liability to a person, you're

9

not -- the State is not going to pay in the sense of

10

damages.

11

Certainly whether custody shall continue or not depends on

12

what happens before, but that cannot be the test of

13

whether there are retroactive effects, because --

14

It's not backward-looking in that sense.

QUESTION:

But it is reviewing -- I mean, in

15

order to grant relief it is reviewing past actions,

16

whereas in a classic injunctive case I suppose the

17

question is, at the present time, now, is the defendant

18

doing something defendant ought not to do, and yet in --

19

as Justice Ginsburg's question suggests, in the habeas

20

case it's the -- the consequence is entirely a consequence

21

of something that happened in the past.

that sense it is backward-looking.

Is it plausible or possible that Congress wanted

2

the courts to go into each of those permutations and

3

combinations and figure out somewhat different rules as we

4

try to work out how to apply this thing retroactively?
That's the thing that worries me about it the

5
6

most, because it seems to me -- it can't be true, for

7

example, that a person who's already on appeal, who's

8

argued his case, and the judge is just about to release

9

the decision, or has released it but the mandate hasn't

10

come down, is now supposed to go back to stage 1 and -- or

11

is he?
I mean, suppose that he filed his initial

12

13

petition 1 year and 5 days after the conviction took

14

place.

15

possible combinations and so I wondered if Congress really

16

intended us to do all that.

Does it count?

17

MS. WELLMAN:

I mean, my mind began to swim with

I think that you must do that

because Congress was silent, and when Congress is silent,

that if Congress knew about Landgraf, they understood the

MS. WELLMAN:

QUESTION:

5

MS. WELLMAN:

I --

Something else is the default rule.
I think when you read that what

6

you have to understand is that when the Court -- starting

7

with Landgraf, when the Court says the default rule is

8

prospective for a retroactive statute it means statutes

9

that have a retroactive effect as they define it in

10

Landgraf, which is, attach new legal consequences to

11

conduct completed before enactment, and new legal

12

consequences means only in paravested rights that had

13

become a right before, under the existing law, impose new

14

liabilities on conduct that had already occurred and was

15

completed, or impose new duties on transactions that were

16

already completed.

What I'm

1

worried and wonder about is what kind of a mare's nest --

2

what kind of a complexity are we getting into if we try to

3

apply it retro or post -- however you want to put the

4

word, if you try to apply it to the set of cases that have

5

already been filed and are at various stages of

6

proceeding.
For example, I take it that a judge who is about

7
8

to decide under this new rule would at least have to give

9

the habeas petitioner a chance to go back and reargue and

10

possibly introduce new witnesses, wouldn't he, before

11

applying a new standard?
That's the kind of thing that's worrying me, and

12

3

that's why I'd appreciate your addressing that kind of

4

point.

5

MS. WELLMAN:

Yes, I think it -- I understand

6

your concern, and I think it's well-taken.

7

we look at the proceedings at the point -- as to all

8

petitions that had already been filed.

9

that particular petition was at on April 24,

20
21

What we do is,

Whatever stage
996, is

where we pick up and apply the new law.
So as with Mr. Lindh his appeal was pending, the

22

Seventh Circuit had not reached a decision yet, it was to

23

apply 2254(d), and it did indeed ask the parties to

24

rebrief both retroactivity and what the new statute means

25

and how it applies to his case.

The Seventh Circuit would have to

decision whether to grant or deny habeas, and the reason

for that is a little bit unlike a normal appeal, because

the district court did and whether it did it right, but it

is independently determining whether to grant a habeas

MS. WELLMAN:

is whether the State court's decision on the facts as

offer new evidence.

that situation all you're doing is you're -- as a

That just makes no sense.

Ms. Wellman, I'd like to be clear

6

about what we're discussing currently here.

Am I wrong

7

that what we're discussing is whether Congress should be

8

deemed to have said X rather than Y because if it said X,

9

the rule which we have developed concerning retroactivity

10

would be very difficult to apply and create a whole lot of

complexity, and therefore Congress should be deemed to

12

have said X rather than X?

that if we accept your conclusion on this matter you're

Landgraf, whenever a new statute comes into effect that

21

into effect, for example, if a statute case gave -- took

1

If it had not proceeded to a jury trial yet, if

2

the case had been filed and you were in the early stages,

3

he wouldn't have a right to a jury trial even though when

4

he did the underlying conduct, when he made his decision

5

what court to file in and what to make the cause of

6

action, even though he expected to get a jury at that

7

point.

So that part I think is fairly straightforward.
In addition, I don't think the flip is true that

the rule that Mr. Liebman would ask us to apply is easy,

can say what it wants, and that's what the court does.

QUESTION:

Right.

The problem is when the Congress

doesn't speak.

Congress a default rule so it would know when it says

25

nothing how the court is going to respond to that.

The object of Landgraf was to give

54

1

Now, it seems to me that making the rule hard to

2

apply, maybe we were not successful in Landgraf.

3

Landgraf needs to be modified so that Congress will

4

have -- it will know what this Court will do, what it will

5

instruct lower courts to do when Congress is silent.

6

MS. WELLMAN:

Maybe

Well, that's certainly possible,

7

because what Landgraf did, although I do think it

8

certainly clarifies the prior law, it does still in

9

essence need two different default rules.

10

One is, if it is the type of statute that falls

11

within the class of cases that has a retroactive effect,

12

then it will be presumed not to apply.

13

fall within that class of cases, however, then it does

14

apply, so you still have to determine at some point which

15

class does it fall in.

16

If it does not

One way to look at that, I think, is to say if

17

it's jurisdictional, if it goes primarily to what the

18

Court does, not the parties, if it's procedural, as it is

19

here, if it's a secondary layer of conduct as it is here,

20

adjudication is secondary as opposed to primary conduct,

21

if it's one of those things, then you simply don't do the

Landgraf analysis.

I think what you're going to be

doing is doing a lot more of generalized statutory intent

construction, statutory -- concerning the statutory intent

before you ever get to retroactivity analysis.

And I think that in Landgraf what we wanted to

do was to get to the heart of the matter, and the heart of

the matter is, Congress, if you've thought this through

what you want, tell us and that's what we'll do.

14

If you haven't, we're going to look at this

15

statute, what does it do, what is the change, what is the

16

degree of connection between the change and the conduct

17

regulated, and if that has a retroactive effect impairing

18

a vested right, attaching new liabilities, we won't apply

19

it, so at least someone is doing that balancing process,

20

and Congress may do it.

21

You can encourage Congress to do it, but whereas

22

here if they don't do it, then you -- the Court should be

23

doing that balancing process, and if you just do your

24

generalized statutory maximums about intent and negative

25

inference, you're never going to get to that point.

QUESTION:

1

Well, as Justice Breyer has pointed

2

out, we might say, well, we're going to have a very

3

Procrustean rule on a Landgraf model saying you've got to

4

be express in this abundantly obvious way or we're not

5

going to recognize it, and the argument for that would be,

6

well, it keeps the analysis simple.

7

But Justice Breyer's question shows that if in

8

fact we took that position we would then land ourselves in

9

this particular case, or land all of the Federal courts

10

that have to pass on these things, in a situation in which

11

a lot of very complicated case-by-case analysis is going

12

to have to go on, so maybe it would be better to sort of

3

confront intent at the front end under our normal rules,

4

assuming there's a textual basis in the statute for the

5

application of some interpretive rule, and have a simpler

6

result in applying the statute in individual cases.

7

Wouldn't that be a good argument?

MS. WELLMAN:

No.

I don't meant -- but I don't

mean to sound circular, but it seems to me that if you're

20

going to do that -- I mean, all we're talking about here

21

is whether 2254(d) applies, and if -- what you're saying

22

is because they say

23

none of

24

that's too many different things to draw a negative

25

inference from, that there may be reasons why Congress

54 applies to all cases pending, then

53 applies to cases pending.

It seems to me that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIEBMAN:

9

Under section

10

reads section

07 (c), the same negative implication that

11

says if your case was pending,

12

that same implication would say that if your case was not

pending, then -- but you file it immediately after the

statute came into effect, then Chapter

53 would apply.

But in your view the filing date

controls?
MR. LIEBMAN:

Under

the statute are cases pending.

07(c), because the words of
Under the retroactivity

20

analysis I do not say that the filing date would control.

21

What controls there are the three conditions that have to

22

be in place in order for a habeas action to become matured

23

and unconditional.

24
25

There has to be exhaustion of State remedies,
the time for cert has to have passed, or the Supreme Court

has denied cert.

That's 2244(c), which says if the

2

Supreme Court acts on the merits habeas is over and done

3

with.
And then the third point is, you have to be in

custody.

6

the point of filing, so in some cases the third thing that

7

will happen will be that you're in custody at the moment

8

the court says to look to see if you're in custody, but in

some cases exhaustion occurs after you file, or the denial

It's when all three of those things have
happened that you -QUESTION:

Mr. Liebman, your position as I

14

understand it is that this affects prior conduct within

15

the meaning of Landgraf if the procedural rule, although

16

on its surface procedural, benefits one side.

17

MR. LIEBMAN:

Is that --

outcome in the series of cases such that you can say the

law, what Congress wants to happen --

20

QUESTION:

What do you do about the jury trial

21

example mentioned by Ms. Wellman?

22

the ability to have a jury trial is always in favor of the

23

defendant, because if he wants it, he can get it, and if

24

he doesn't want it, he doesn't get it.

25

Surely the jury trial,

trial must, if there's no other indication that we must

assume that it does not apply to, what, to conduct entered

3

into before the provision was adopted?

4

MR. LIEBMAN:

Your Honor, I'd need to see the

exact provision in the exact setting, but many, many

6

cases, the actual procedures that are going to be used,

9

No, the jury trial always benefits

the defendant, and I've always assumed that if you have

10

a -- you know, no more jury trial for this class of cases,

11

it simply applies when this case comes up, and your

12

position is that it wouldn't.
MR. LIEBMAN:

3

No, well, in the Daubert case the

4

argument was the jury trial is always better for the

5

criminal defendant, but it's sometimes better for

6

plaintiffs in civil cases.

and that's the -- the question is whether the legislature
