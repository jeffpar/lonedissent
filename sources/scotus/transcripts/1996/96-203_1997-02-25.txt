CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 96-203, Joyce Johnson v. The United States.

Mr. Sheppard.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WM. J. SHEPPARD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHEPPARD:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner Joyce Johnson was tried and convicted

10
11

on a single count of perjury, in violation of 18 United

12

States Code 1623.

13

to this Court's holding in Gaudin.

14

conducted in total reliance on the then-existing and long­

15

standing precedent of the Eleventh Circuit, which for more

16

than 50 years had removed the element of materiality from

17

the jury.

18

Her conviction occurred 6 months prior
Her trial was

That precedent further provided that the judge

19

would instruct the jury that the element of materiality

20

had been found in favor of the Government.

21

counsel's entire preparation, strategy, and performance in

22

the trial was dictated by this now-overruled precedent.

23

This reliance on the wrong precedent from beginning to end

24

of the proceedings caused an infection of the proceedings

25

and rendered them totally different than what our

Constitution requires.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Sheppard, the element was still

3

in the case.

4

for the judge, not that you didn't have to prove

5

materiality, so what was the difference in the proof you

6

said that shaped trial attorney's strategy?

7
8

It was just believed to be materiality was

The element has to be proved.

What was

different about the proof that was presented of the
materiality here from what it would have been if the trier

10

had been a jury rather than a judge?
MR. SHEPPARD:

11

Justice Ginsburg, we agree that

12

the element was there and the Government had the duty to

13

prove it, albeit a footnote under Eleventh Circuit

14

precedent was questionable as to what the standard of

15

proof was, but I submit that when a lawyer gets a case,

16

what he does, he looks to see what are the elements of the

17

case, and I think that's the first thing that a lawyer

18

does.

1

He pulls the statute.

He then goes to the

20

standard jury instructions, and what happened here was

21

that counsel had to persuade a judge, and was -- his

22

opportunity to persuade a jury was taken away, and I

23

submit that cases are tried based on elements starting

24

from beginning to end, with the questions that you prepare

25

to submit to a district judge to ask in voir dire, when we

opening statements focus on elements.

QUESTION:

Inevitably, those

Well, for example, could you show us

4

what trial counsel might have made of the materiality of

5

these statements were the matter tried to a jury?

6

MR. SHEPPARD:

Yes, ma'am, I believe I can.

7

Ms. Johnson in her grand jury testimony was

8

never asked directly, did you receive the money that went

9

into the renovation of your home from the target of this

10

grand jury investigation, or we assume it is, Mr. Fields?
She told the grand jury that she got money for

11
12

the renovation of her home from her mama, when indeed she

13

was never asked directly did it come from Fields.

14

if it came from a third source -- suppose she'd robbed a

15

bank and put the money in.

16

material as to any investigation of Mr. Fields.

17

Well,

It would not have been

Secondly, I believe that the cross-examination

18

of the jury foreman, and even more specifically of Special

19

Agent William Stull of the FBI, who testified that the --

20

about what the grand jury was investigating, that cross-

21

examination was severely limited because counsel knew that

22

50 years of precedent in his circuit and 70 years of

23

precedent in all of the circuits as it relates to a

24

perjury prosecution, that that element was taken away from

25

him.

QUESTION:

1

Well, the Eleventh Circuit certainly

2

didn't -- doesn't agree with your precedent -- they said

3

after reviewing the record in this case, we find

4

overwhelming evidence of the materiality of Johnson's

5

statement.

6

Johnson's false statements about the source of the money

7

were not material.
MR. SHEPPARD:

8

9

No reasonable juror could conclude that

said, Mr. Chief Justice.

I agree that that's what they
However, they aren't the

10

individuals that our history and the precedent of this

11

Court says ought to be answering those kinds of questions,

12

and as this Court unanimously held in Gaudin, and

13

respectfully, the Eleventh Circuit is just squarely wrong

14

when they say that the right to a jury trial, which is the

15

first codified law in this Nation, isn't a substantial

16

right.

17

QUESTION:

They're not -- they may have said

18

that, they may not have, but I was simply reading what

19

they said about the evidence of materiality, which was

20

what you were talking about.

21

You say it should have been determined by a

22

jury, but that's a different thing from saying that it was

23

a very thin case for materiality.

24

MR. SHEPPARD:

25

was a thin case.

I'm not here to argue that this

case -- question.

2

jury trial for the citizens in this country is so

3

historically in place, and the jurisprudence of this Court

4

has reinforced time and time again the Eleventh Circuit is

wrong, just as the Government is wrong.

I'm here to argue that the right to a

QUESTION:

They say we've

No, every day of the week it's a

8

common thing for a judge to misinstruct a jury on an

9

element of a defense.

10

MR. SHEPPARD:

11

QUESTION:

This is not a --

In which case the jury has not

12

considered whether or not the person did or did not commit

13

that element.

14

common.

15

one thinks it deprives a person who doesn't object of a

16

right to a jury trial in that case.

17

differ from that?

That happens every day of the week, very

Now, how is this case different from that?

MR. SHEPPARD:

18

No

How does this case

In two respects, Justice Breyer.

19

One, in this case the court did not misinstruct about the

20

element.

21

It totally omitted the element.
QUESTION:

Well, that's true, but so what is the

22

difference?

23

less fair than a misinstruction.

24
25

Sometimes that would be more fair, sometimes

QUESTION:

Your case is one where it wasn't all

that unfair.

1

MR. SHEPPARD:

2

QUESTION:

Well, it's --

In other cases misinstructions are

3

disastrous, but -- so how -- is that -- why should we draw

4

that line?

5

MR. SHEPPARD:

Well, if I could go back to your

6

earlier question to answer it first, sir, the second thing

7

that is different in this case than just a misinstruction

8

on an element, in addition to totally omitting it, the

9

Eleventh Circuit pattern jury instruction number 43, which

10

was taken from cases, and that's found in the Joint

11

Appendix, Your Honor, at page 67, that instruction, which

12

was taken from precedent of the old -- of the Fifth

13

Circuit, prior to Congress creating the Eleventh Circuit

14

and carrying over the precedent of the Fifth to the

15

Eleventh provided, and this jury was indeed instructed,

16

that the materiality of the matter involved in the alleged

17

false testimony is not a matter with which you are

18

concerned, but rather is a question for the court to

19

decide.

20

And then went on, you are instructed that the

21

questions asked the defendant as alleged constituted

22

material matters in the grand jury proceedings referred to

23

in the indictment, and respectfully, Justice Breyer, that

24

is a partial directed verdict in a criminal case.

25

not just a misdescription of an element.

It's

And the way cases are tried from voir dire to

2

opening statement to closing argument to instructions are

3

all within the structural framework of elements.

4

just the way we lawyers do it, and --

5

QUESTION:

That's

Well, it's also true, is it not,

6

counsel -- isn't it true that in this trial, when the

7

Government tried to put on evidence of materiality before

8

the jury and the court, that the petitioner's own trial

9

lawyer wouldn't allow it on the grounds that it was for

10

the judge.

11

MR. SHEPPARD:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Well, absolutely.

Who said, absolutely keep that

evidence out of here.
MR. SHEPPARD:

And even before the trial, trial

15

counsel was filing motions in limine because trial counsel

16

and the lawyers who try these cases, we believe in

17

precedent, and we believe that when you're in the face of

18

longstanding precedent, that it is not principled

19

lawyering to waste time making frivolous objections --

20

QUESTION:

Well, could invited error in some

21

case defeat the petitioner's subsequent claim if the

22

petitioner himself had said, you may not consider

23

materiality?

24
25

MR. SHEPPARD:

I don't think in the face of 50

years of precedent in that circuit that that would be the

1

appropriate way to handle it.

2

QUESTION:

You can't invite --

I would have thought that invited

3

error could defeat such a claim.

4

Circuit didn't decide that issue, I guess.

5

MR. SHEPPARD:

Now, the Eleventh

No, ma'am, and I believe that the

6

Solicitor General has indicated that it doesn't urge that

7

position, but I still -- even if they did, I don't think

8

invited error can be invited without waiver or

9

stipulation, and there wasn't.

10

There were motions in limine prior to trial in

11

this case seeking to limit evidence going to the jury on

12

the grounds that it would only be relevant as to

13

materiality, and why should the Government be allowed, in

14

violation of rule 403, to put on evidence that was not

15

relevant, and was nothing but prejudicial?
QUESTION:

16
17

But the judge has to make

a materiality determination, and it's relevant to the

18

judge's determination.

19

the judge hears the materiality evidence, or do you?

20

Maybe I'm wrong.

I don't think you do.

MR. SHEPPARD:

21

You don't exclude the jury while

Well, you know, from reading the

22

cases, Justice Kennedy, that's a good question.

23

they're all tried differently in about three or four

24

different protocols, depending upon which circuit you're

25

in.

I think

1

But respectfully, I was -- or the trial counsel

2

was seeking to exclude the evidence that could only be

3

relevant as to materiality from going to the jury, and

4

trial counsel was doing that because he was in the face of

5

massive precedent that's dictated.

6

Not only is this element not going to be going

7

to the jury, but I am also affirmatively going to direct a

8

verdict in favor of the Government if I find it is --

9

QUESTION:

Well, to be frank, I guess what's

10

troubling us is that if you had a really strong

11

materiality case the evidence would have come in and you

12

would have argued it either before the judge with the jury

13

absent or with the jury present, and an instruction to the

14

jury that this is not really of their concern.

15

MR. SHEPPARD:

16

QUESTION:

Well, respectfully --

It's just a little hard for us to

17

grasp the plain error aspect, reversible error aspect in

18

this case when we didn't think the materiality was at

19

question either before the judge or the jury, even under

20

this wall of precedent.

21

MR. SHEPPARD:

Well, but respectfully, the wrong

22

entity is judging the defendant guilty.

take that one away from you, and respectfully, the wrong

2

entity is judging the defendant guilty, and respectfully,

3

I believe the error goes up the next line to the circuit

court of appeals when they'd say the three of us are going

5

to substitute these 12 citizen jurors' opinion of what

6

that evidence might be, and -QUESTION:

7
8

Is it your position that there simply

couldn't be any harmless error analysis in this situation?
MR. SHEPPARD:

9

There is nothing for harmless

10

error analysis to attach to.

11

There is no object upon which

12

QUESTION:

13

There is no jury verdict.

Well, there is a jury verdict finding

the person guilty.
MR. SHEPPARD:

14

Well, but it's not a valid jury

15

verdict if it's only three-quarters of what the

16

Constitution in the history of our country says to us we

17

have.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but there is a valid jury

19

verdict on the other elements, and it could be possible,

20

could it not, that as we've said in some of our earlier

21

cases, the jury that found elements 1, 2, and 3, would

22

necessarily have found element 4?

23

established, then there would be no problem, would there?

24

Wouldn't that establish harmless error?

If that were

QUESTION:

1

I mean, when the jury has never been

2

given a - - an instruction as to what is, you know, beyond

3

a reasonable doubt, which is what one of our earlier cases

4

involved, then you have a jury that said nothing at all.

5

But this jury said three things.

6

those three things could automatically and implicitly

7

include the fourth, isn't it?
MR. SHEPPARD:

8

9

It's conceivable that

I don't think so in a directed

verdict case, as we have here, or a partial directed

10

verdict.

Not only was this taken away from the jury, but

11

the judge told them, don't be bothered with it, don't

12

concern yourself with it, and I find it so.

13

QUESTION:

Who asked for that instruction?

14

MR. SHEPPARD:

Both the defense and the

15

Government.

That instruction had been in place in the

16

Fifth Circuit, or the Eleventh Circuit pattern jury

17

instructions since 1985, when the District Judges

18

Association promulgated such instructions, and it's

19

interesting, in some circuits -- and you know you have the

20

Tenth Circuit and Ninth Circuit en banc ruling that this

21

is harmful error and per se reversal - - they take

22

different approaches, but these types of cases fall into

23

two distinct categories.

24

instructions only say, don't concern yourself with

25

materiality.

Some circuits' pattern jury

Some of the pattern jury instructions
They just instruct
Oath,

In the Eleventh Circuit, and we submit adds a

9

double injury to the plaintiff, or to the defendant in

10

this case, the judge says, don't you be concerned with

11

materiality, and I find it, and those are the most

12

egregious instructions, and those that I respectfully

13

submit for two different theories require reversal.

14

They're both violations of the Fifth -- or, they're a

15

violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Sheppard, sometimes evidence on a

17

particular element is so strong that the defendant would

18

rather not have the jury confront that element, and we had

19

such a case this term.

20

MR. SHEPPARD:

21

QUESTION:

I'm familiar with Old Chief.

So if we're told that the element, at

22

least the Eleventh Circuit thought that the proof was

23

overwhelming, and we have a trial record where the defense

24

counsel is saying, please, judge, don't say the word

25

materiality to the jury, how do we know that this case

MR. SHEPPARD:

Because you're the wrong entity

to be making that decision.

4

occurring in the trial, or during the trial -- I won't say

5

it was prior because I don't frankly recall, but the

6

record is clear that counsel made a Rule 29 motion for

7

judgment of acquittal and directed that 29 motion to

8

materiality.

In addition, prior to that

9

Materiality was hotly litigated throughout the

10

course of this case, returning to my earlier point, with

11

motions in limine, objections, motion for a judgment of

12

acquittal, but it was all done with a mind set knowing

13

what the judge was going to do when he instructed the

14

jury, and that's just a structural defect in these

15

proceedings that render it absolutely meaningless.

16

There is no meaningful jury verdict.

no case, I submit, that anybody can cite that says in a

homicide case the court can just take away one of the

QUESTION:

I don't think anyone disputes the

6

importance of the jury trial, but where I'm -- my

7

difficulty is that there are only a handful of things that

8

this Court has said is a structural right, just a handful.

9

MR. SHEPPARD:
QUESTION:

10

Yes, sir.

And I don't find anywhere in that

11

handful in any of the case law, though I grant you it's

12

somewhat open, though I think in the Roy -- we removed it

13

in the habeas context and made clear it wasn't structural

14

in that context, so why should it be structural the fact

15

that the judge decided a matter that the jury should have

16

decided?

17

I grant you that's a wrong thing to do, but why

18

is it equivalent to the using a -- you know, not beyond

MR. SHEPPARD:

That's

Well, the constitutional right to

8

a jury trial embodies a profound judgment about the way in

9

which the law should be enforced and justice administered.

10

It is a structural guarantee.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Sheppard, but we know that all

12

kinds of things go wrong in jury trials, and judges give

13

the most opaque charges, that you could look at the jury

14

and they don't know what the heck the judge is talking

15

about, and we accept that.

16

MR. SHEPPARD:

Well, certainly we do, because

17

that's our system, and it is --

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. SHEPPARD:

And that happens.

There's no

20

doubt that it happens.

But if you ask 100 laymen, if you

21

went to a four-dog fight and you only got to have three

22

dogs in the fight against the Government -- and remember

23

that part of the value of the jury trial is to protect the

citizens against the Government.

that is only against the Government.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Sheppard, let me test whether you

3

think this thing is structural in the narrow sense that

4

our opinions have used it.

5

burglary, and evidence is introduced that the window was

6

broken, that the -- you know, there was an entry.

7
8

Let's assume a prosecution for

The defendant does not counter that argument.
His only defense, introduced by other people, is that he
was somewhere else.

He has an alibi defense.

10

The judge forgets to tell the jury that in order

11

to convict it must find that the defendant knowingly broke

12

and entered the house.

13

the guy walked in, somebody walked in, you know, in the

14

dark, very carefully took things out of the house.

Now, here's a broken window, and

It's possible, I suppose -- well, it's not

15
16

possible.

It's simply not possible that a jury who found

17

that there was a breaking and entering, and that this

18

fellow did it, would not have also found that he did it

1

knowingly.

20

implicitly includes the other.

On that evidence, it's just -- the one finding

21

Now, would you say that that conviction has to

22

be reversed because the judge did not tell the jury that

23

you have to find that this was knowingly done?

24

MR. SHEPPARD:

25

QUESTION:

Probably not.

Well, then, it's not structural.

If

1

you say no, then it's not a structural error.
MR. SHEPPARD:

2

Well, but it is -- knowing is

3

different than materiality.

4

totally, and I respectfully submit that in order to follow

5

the reasoning in the Eleventh Circuit you've got to call

6

the right to a jury trial a nonsubstantial right, that

7

it's not a substantial right, and respectfully I don't

8

think it can be.

They are different elements,

But I think here, that the directed verdict is

9
10

not opaque.

It's clear.

So you have a two-step analysis

11

here, or two-step deprivation here, not only the omission

12

of the knowing, but I'm going to tell you, ladies and

13

gentlemen of the jury, that he knew it.

QUESTION:

Yes, but your client --

QUESTION:

But Mr. Sheppard, supposing in

Justice Scalia's example, the judge did just that and

rather, than would be the case under the hypothetical,

I

believe that here the taking away and then the affirmative

statement, coupled with the entire framework in which this

case traveled because of the longstanding precedent, I

respectfully submit that the fundamental structure of this

Well, yes, but so you're saying it's

I think that's what Gaudin stands for,

QUESTION:

Then why shouldn't your answer have

been different on the knowing example, because in the

10

knowing example the jury never made a finding of

11

knowingly, never thought about it.

12

MR. SHEPPARD:

I think our case is stronger

13

simply because of the affirmative direction of the

14

verdict, of the partial verdict.

15

But returning to Justice Breyer's question, this

16

Court has ticked off a few rights that are structural

17

rights that are per se reversible, and I think it's time

18

for this Court to put teeth into the language of cases

19

QUESTION:

He just -- really, he says what

materiality is, jury, is that materiality means, well, it

has something to do with it, a little bit.
I'm trying to focus you on what's bothering me

the most, which is how one would draw a distinction --

8

though it's there in some cases, how one would draw a

distinction between misinstructions, really stupid

it seems like a bog to me.

MR. SHEPPARD:

the line, because I think that's the way these cases,

system.

there is merely an omission, I'm not so sure, but I know

at that extreme, given the trial of the case totally based

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14

Only if

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd first like to address why the plain error

15

rule applies in this case, and then turn to the question

16

of why petitioner is not entitled to relief under the

17

plain error rule.

18

Now, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

19

impose a contemporaneous objection requirement on any

20

party that wishes to assign an error either to the trial

21

court or on appeal, and those provisions are set forth in

22

our brief at the appendix, page 3a.

23

The first rule is Federal Rule of Criminal

24

Procedure 30, which states that no party may assign as

25

error any portion of the charge or omission there from

1

unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires

2

to consider its verdict.

3

Rule 51 amplifies that requirement by stating

4

that exceptions are not necessary, but that it is

5

sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or the

6

order of the court is made, makes known to the court the

7

action which this party - - which that party desires the

8

court to take.

9

Petitioner did not comply with those two

10

provisions.

She did not object to the court's instruction

11

on materiality.

12

not make the argument, which was being widely made by

13

defendants around the country at the time of this trial,

14

that materiality should be decided by the jury rather than

15

the judge, and as a result of failing to comply with the

16

contemporaneous objection requirement for these two rules,

17

the source for reviewing any claim of error that she now

18

wishes to make is Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of

19

Criminal Procedure.

20

QUESTION:

Indeed, she had sought it, and she did

Mr. Dreeben, I take it that in the

21

Ninth Circuit and maybe some other circuit also the court

22

of appeals rule is that you don't have to make a Rule 30

instruction when it would be futile if you've got clear

24

circuit precedent in point going the other way?

being an instruction to defense counsel not to object, or

that there is no need to object, then I think that the

The court expects that parties will comply with

relevant contemporaneous objection rules even if the

objection at the time might be deemed futile under
governing authority, and there are good reasons for that.

10

The first is that it shows that the party really

11

cares about the issue.

12

really wanted the jury to resolve the materiality issue,

13

petitioner would have manifested that not by acquiescing

14

in an instruction or requesting an instruction taking

materiality away from the jury, but by doing everything

the petitioner could to make the point that she wanted the

jury to decide material --

there are plenty of examples where petitioners have

preserved claims in the trial court, brought them up to

4

this Court, and won by overruling Supreme Court precedent.

6

QUESTION:

Would that trial judge have been able

to grant the request?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

The trial judge would have

8

been barred by circuit law from granting the request,

but - QUESTION:

Well, I think that it's not

15

strange at all because it shows, Justice Scalia, one that

16

it's important to this petitioner, which is of value in

17

itself.

18

The second reason is that it will prompt the

19

petitioner to make an offer of proof or whatever

20

supplementation of the record the petitioner feels is

21

appropriate to show what that petitioner would have done

differently if the law had been in its favor, which

You would not necessarily do it

differently, Chief Justice Rehnquist, but it would show

differently.
We've heard today that the course of the trial

QUESTION:

How does the doctrine of invited

error fit into this whole picture?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think, Justice O'Connor,

16

that had the Government made and preserved a claim of

invited error that might well be the correct way for this

case to be resolved under cases such as Johnson v. The

When Gaudin was decided, petitioner for the

1

2

first time raised a claim that materiality was decided by

3

the judge --

4
5
6

QUESTION:

And that was before the case became

final.
MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, so petitioner is entitled

7

to say that based on this Court's intervening precedent

8

error occurred, and then the question becomes how do you

9

analyze the consequences of that, and our submission is

10

that the text of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

11

themselves require that it be analyzed as plain error

12

unless we had had available to us an invited error

13

argument and had made it, which we did not.

14

Petitioner's argument is that you should just

15

disregard the text of the Federal Rules of Criminal

16

Procedure either because an objection would be deemed

17

futile, or because the error here should be characterized

18

as structural and that somehow structural errors are

19

exempt from contemporaneous objection requirements.

20

Neither of those submissions are correct.

In

21

our view, there is no textual exception in the Federal

22

Rules of Criminal Procedure for objections later deemed

23

futile, and this Court indeed, in considering the

24

analogous issue in the habeas context, has held that

25

futility is not a ground for excusing procedural default

1

in failing to raise a claim before the relevant tribunal

2

in the State system.

3

In Engle v. Isaac the Court squarely held that

4

even if a claim is perceived correctly by a litigant to be

5

futile, it is not cause for failing to raise it.

6

QUESTION:

But didn't those cases turn heavily

7

on the fact there was collateral view, and here you're on

8

direct review.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, yes, Justice Stevens, those

10

cases are on collateral review, but I think the point is

11

that the Court thought that there are benefits to

12

requiring a party to object before the relevant tribunal

13

with power to decide even if on-point governing law at the

14

time was adverse, and it did not carve out, even in an

15

exercise of its discretionary authority, an exception from

16

the procedural default rule for claims that would be

17

perceived as futile.

18

I think this case follows a fortiori, because

19

here we have express provisions of the Federal Rules of

20

Criminal Procedure that contain no futility exception, and

21

it would be even more of a step for the Court to carve out

22

of an express text of a rule an exception for something

23

that it has not even recognized in its discretionary

24

capacity on habeas review.

MR. DREEBEN:

What we're dealing --

I know a few who would.
Justice O'Connor, I think that

13

those few probably would no matter what this Court told

them, but the point here is that the class of claims that

15

are likely to result in a reversal of existing precedent

QUESTION:

MR. DREEBEN:

This case was tried 6 months after

8

the Ninth Circuit's en banc ruling in Gaudin and 6 months

9

before this Court's ruling affirming that ruling in

10

Gaudin, so petitioner was clearly on notice that this was

11

a claim that had been excepted not only by a Federal court

12

of appeals but by several State courts, and was clearly an

issue that was in play.

QUESTION:

Right.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

To my knowledge, every circuit but

5

the Tenth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit has accepted that

6

view.

7

In other words, all of the circuits that have

8

addressed this issue except for the en banc Tenth Circuit

9

and the en banc Ninth Circuit have held that if you do not

10

object at trial, even if the objection was futile, you are

11

within the plain error provisions of Rule 52, and the

12

claim must be evaluated for plain error and not reversed

13

unless it is plain error.
Two circuits have said plain error is out of

14
15

balance.

16

incorrect.

17

That's the position that I say is squarely

Now, turning to the question of how Rule 52(b)

18

is applied if this is treated as a plain error case, we

19

have two arguments on why this error at the trial should

20

not be reversed under the plain error rule.

21

that the plain error rule should be read to require that

22

the error be plain both at the time of trial and at the

23

time of appeal, not simply at the time of appeal.

that route.

2:

The D.C. Circuit does read Rule 52 the same way

3

that we do, and has required parties to raise -- has said

4

that if the claim is clear at the time of appeal it must

5

also be clear at the time of trial in order to come within

6

Rule 52, so the D.C. Circuit agrees with us on that point,

7

but then the D.C. Circuit has improvised what it calls a

8

supervening decision doctrine that allows it to review

9

claims when new law comes along at the time of appeal.

10

QUESTION:

It seems to me sort of

11

counterintuitive to say that it has to be clear at the

12

time of trial, because what you're saying then is that

13

you're going to forgive counsel for not raising an

objection that clearly should have been raised.

16

was, you know, not clear at that time, then his failure to

raise it is going to be conclusive against him.

19

MR. DREEBEN:

He'll be

Isn't it

I don't think so, Justice Scalia.

20

I think that the purpose of the plain error rule as

21

described by this Court in United States v. Frady is to

22

permit the court of appeals to remedy error that was so

23

gross and so egregious that the trial judge himself was

24

derelict for not noticing it, even though the defense

25

counsel or the prosecutor had not brought it to his

And in a case like this the trial court was

3

certainly not derelict in its duties in not sending

4

materiality --

5

QUESTION:

So you're saying it depends on kind

6

of the frame of mind of the judge, of the trial judge as

7

to whether an error is plain or not?

8

9

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

It depends on, Chief Justice

Rehnquist, on the clarity of the law at the time of trial.

10

If the law at the time of trial is clear, so that the

11

trial judge is on notice that what I'm supposed to do is

12

send materiality to the jury, and if the defendant and the

13

prosecutor both fail to bring that to the trial court's

14

attention, the trial court is nonetheless under an

15

obligation to comply with the governing law.

16

And as this Court described in Frady, we then

17

have a situation where the court of appeals may notice

18

that plain error, because the trial judge should have

19

figured it out on his own even though the parties --

QUESTION:

MR. DREEBEN:

that the language of Rule 52(b) itself contemplates that

namely, obvious error, and it is hard to say that it is

this.

QUESTION:

No, but his basic point is, as I take

it, that look, if it's the language of the rule, this is

2

vehicle for that, and our submission is that it is not.

3

QUESTION:

Isn't the difficulty with the plain

4

error analysis, though, Mr. Dreeben, that the plain error

5

rule I think we would all agree was simply not devised to

6

address the situation of the new rule, and therefore you

7

either take the tack -- if you're going to apply it to the

8

new rule situation, you either take the tack that you do,
says it has to have been plain at the time of trial, in

10

which case there will be, any new-rule case is

11

automatically going to be decided in the Government's

12

favor -- it's like sort of a Teague bar in a case in which

13

there was no objection below -- or we're going to say,

14

well, we're not going to cut him off like that, so we'll

15

say it's sufficient if it's plain at the time of appeal,

16

and then the real issue is going to be decided on the

fourth Olano prong.

And would it make more sense to say, this isn't

truly a plain error case, and simply have a rule for new

prong, or something like the harmless error standard if

MR. DREEBEN:

that discrimination in the selection of a grand jury is a

Court to examine whether correcting the error serves the

that there was no defense to materiality in this case.

The evidence of Earl Fields' drug-dealing which was being

14

investigated by the grand jury was deemed by the

15

petitioner to be prejudicial to her interests, and she

16

wanted if at all possible for the jury not to hear that

I think that as a bedrock principle, when you

2

have a case like this one, where there is no reasonable

probability that a retrial would produce a different

outcome, that the plain error rule dictates affirmance,

5

not reversal.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Dreeben, are you then saying this

is a case-by-case determination, so that the court of

appeals would have to look at the record and see how much

evidence there was of materiality so that the materiality

10

evidence was controversial then send it back for a new

trial?

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct, Justice Ginsburg.

13

I think that the right balance of interests, if

14

the Court doesn't accept our argument on obviousness at

15

the time of trial, and one is looking at this from the

16

overall weighing process at the final step of Olano, that

17

the question that should be foremost in the Court's mind

18

is, is there any reasonable probability that this

19

constitutional error made any difference in the outcome of

20

the trial?

21

If there is no reasonable probability of that,

22

and by that I don't mean that it's more likely than not

23

that the jury might have acquitted, it's just is the Court

24

confident that this is a fair verdict, then the Court

should affirm.

that the jury might have come out the other way, the

Tenth Circuits have concluded that it doesn't if there

2

really was no case to be made on the issue of materiality

4

That is frequently the case, because the issue

5

of materiality is often proved up, as the Court well

6

knows, by the testimony of the grand jury foreman who

7

says, we were looking at drug-dealing and money-laundering

8

by this person, and we therefore asked these questions to

find out the answers to those things, and then the

testimony was given, and now the jury is going to decide

whether the testimony was true or false.

not the centerpiece of most of these cases.

Materiality is

Occasionally, there is a case in which

materiality is hotly contested, and a court of appeals

the case might have come out differently, a new trial is

in order.

is that he reviewed the record, he understood what the

focus of the grand jury investigation was, he understood

why it was relevant to the grand jury to know the source

12

of funds for a house that petitioner purchased potentially

with laundered drug money from her boyfriend, said all of

that on the record, and he then articulated the standard

in what I think is the correct legal standard for

That was in

findings made by a

23

judge cannot cure deficiencies in the jury's findings as

24

to the guilt or innocence of a defendant resulting from

25

the court's failure to instruct it to find an element of

the crime.
The entire rationale of the plain error rule is

3

to prevent lawyers from sand-bagging.

4

to follow a half-a-century of precedent?

5

To follow the Government's argument here is going to cause

6

lawyers, experienced lawyers to object to everything, and

7

for the Solicitor to say that there was a lot of precedent

8

out there going on in the country before this trial is

9

flat wrong.

10

Is it sand-bagging
Certainly not.

If you read the Ninth Circuit opinion in Gaudin,

11

you will find that's a 1001 case.

12

characterized the Ninth Circuit as a maverick circuit on

13

that issue and, finally in that regard, the Ninth Circuit

14

case was a 1001 case.

15

time of this trial the precedent in the Ninth Circuit was

16

that materiality on a perjury case was different than

17

1001, and that is not an argument that helps this Court.

QUESTION:

This Court

This is a 1623 case, and at the

Mr. Sheppard, what do you say to the

19

Government's argument that most circuits had adopted the

20

rule that if you don't raise the objection you come within

21

these provisions even if the objection would have been

22

futile, and it hasn't produced, apparently, in those

23

circuits the flood of futile objections that you contend

24

will occur.

25

MR. SHEPPARD:

Well, I would respectfully submit

that in at least two circuits they've got stay orders on

2

en banc cases awaiting the decision in this case, so I

3

don't know that any lawyer knows what to do in those

4

circuits yet, and I think this is an important case to

5

signal to the trial bar what to do.
As to the structural matter, I would ask the

6

7

Court to harken to the language in Duncan v. Louisiana,

8

which is the case that applied the Sixth Amendment right

9

to a jury trial to the States through the Fourteenth

10

Amendment.
It is a structural guarantee that reflects a

11
12

fundamental decision about the exercise of official power,

13

a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and

14

liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of

15

judges, and if you apply 52(b) -- 52(a) here, that is

16

indeed what you are doing.

17

the Sixth Amendment, and that is contrary to our history,

18

and I think history -- and we tried to set forth some

19

history.

20

QUESTION:

You are pulling the rug out of

Mr. Sheppard, isn't it so that in the

21

cases where there were complaints about a Sixth Amendment

22

violation because women weren't being put on juries that

23

the only defendants who got the benefit of that rule were

24

the ones who had made a contemporaneous objection?

25

thinking particularly of Doran v. Missouri.

And I cannot in good conscience

answer that question directly, because I do not know, but
I respectfully submit that many of these cases, the
structural cases, had objections and some didn't, but I
say that if the rule requiring a contemporaneous
objection -CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr.

Sheppard.

Yes, sir.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
MR. SHEPPARD:

The case is submitted.

Thank you.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
