ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. BIRD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BIRD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

rule of accrual is the most appropriate rule for civil

racketeering claims for three reasons.

15

Secondly, it is consistent with the congressional

16

objectives and underlying policies of the law.

17

greatly reduces the administrative and judicial burden and

18

the economic burden upon the parties because of its ease

19

of application.

First, it takes

Selection of a rule of accrual in RICO must

first of all take account of the sui generis nature of

22

this cause of action and its unique pattern element.

In a

This

In a RICO case this is not true, because the

1

2

injury must arise out of a pattern of racketeering

3

activity, and the pattern itself must also be perpetrated

4

by a RICO enterprise.
QUESTION:

5

These -Well, you're assuming -- when you say

6

that all of the elements don't have to be present at the

7

beginning, you're assuming that if I am injured by the

8

first of three predicate acts I have suffered a RICO

9

injury, aren't you?
I mean, I agree if I'm injured by the second of

10
11

three predicate acts I have suffered a RICO injury, but

12

we've never held that the person who is injured by the

3

first of what later becomes a series of predicate acts has

4

suffered a RICO injury, have we?
MR. BIRD:

5

Well -- no, this Court has not held

6

that.

However, I think an analysis of what a pattern of

7

racketeering is would help in answering that question.

8

you want me to go on I will, but my understanding of a

9

pattern of racketeering activity is that it is simply a

If

20

definition that can only be determined in retrospect, such

21

that even two predicate acts, for example, don't

22

necessarily constitute a pattern.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

But if the injury precedes the

pattern it's rather hard to say that it was a RICO injury.
MR. BIRD:

Well, the -4

QUESTION:

And I'm not sure that that's

necessary in your case.
MR. BIRD:

No, it's not necessary in our case,

but let me -QUESTION:

It is necessary to the theory of

6

statute of limitations you're pressing upon us, however.

7

The argument you were just making assumes that, assumes

8

that the first injury constitutes a RICO injury even

9

though at that time there's no pattern and you have not

10

been injured, when you're injured, by a pattern of

11

racketeering activity.

12

MR. BIRD:

If I may explain, the way I view the

13

structure of the statute and the definition itself, it

14

assumes already in place, and the only way by definition

15

that we can conclude that a pattern exists is that we have

16

a beginning and that we have an end.

17

It can only be decided whether or not it exists

18

in retrospect.

Once we determine that it exists, then

19

that first predicate act is just as much a part of the

20

pattern as the last predicate act, and that's our

21

contention here, and that's why trying to determine when a

22

RICO pattern along this continuum which Congress has

23

defined somehow is borne or springs to life, if you will,

24

under the H.J. Inc. rule of continuity plus relationship,

25

that's an extremely difficult thing for anybody to follow,

1

and certainly difficult for a -QUESTION:

2

That still leaves the metaphysical

3

question, or maybe the legal question of why there can be

4

a RICO injury before there's a RICO in existence.
MR. BIRD:

5

The -- it is a metaphysical question,

6

I grant you, but the way the Congress has defined pattern

7

of racketeering activity and the way this Court has

8

interpreted it, it can only be decided whether or not it

9

existed in the past, and what the framework of your

10

question is, that somehow we need to be able to identify

11

it in prospect, and it can't be done, and that's the

12

point.

13

QUESTION:

14

The normal default rule for when a statute of

15

limitations begins to run is that it runs from when the

16

cause of action accrues, when it exists, right?

17

the normal rule.

18

action exists, then the statute of limitations period

19

begins to run.

20

concede that?

21

Well, I don't see it that way myself.

That's

Once all the elements of the cause of

That's the normal rule, right?

MR. BIRD:

Will you

Well, I would not concede that,

22

because in Havens Realty this Court has indicated that

23

where we have a continuing tort the proper rule of accrual

24

can be from the last predicate act.

25

QUESTION:

Well, it could be, but the normal

1

rule as I understand it is that the statute of limitations

2

will begin to run as of the time the cause of action comes

3

into existence, and under RICO, it doesn't come into

4

existence until all the elements are present, injury,

5

predicate acts, and pattern.

6

MR. BIRD:

In --

7

QUESTION:

And as of that moment, then, it could

8

start to run, the statute of limitations, isn't that

9

right?
MR. BIRD:

10

Well, I have two answers to that.

11

First of all I think the normal rule of accrual, at least

12

in present day law, is a discovery rule, discovery of the

13

elements, or certainly discovery of the injury, and that

14

rule is modified to require --

15

QUESTION:

I think some courts have applied such

16

a rule.

17

accrual of causes of action and running of statute of

18

limitation.

I would not say that that is the normal rule for

19

MR. BIRD:

Well, that may be, and -- I guess

20

I've forgotten what the original question was, if you

21

could restate it, please.

22

QUESTION:

Well, as applied to your case I don't

23

see why the statute wouldn't begin to run once you can say

24

all the elements of the RICO cause of action are in

25

existence.

MR. BIRD:

1

All right, and if I may get to that,

2

I think what this Court has said, for example, in Havens

3

Realty is, if we have a continuing violation the concerns

4

that we typically have for a statute of limitations such

5

as repose and staleness, they fade away.
What we have here is a congressional objective

6

7

as stated by this Court in Turkette, Russello, and a

8

number of other cases, which recognizes that long-term

9

pattern felonious conduct is a bane on our economy.
QUESTION:

10

Well, this statute is patterned after

11

the antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and that also can

12

involve a continuing stream of conduct by the violator,

13

and what rule have we applied there for statute of

14

limitations?

15
16

MR. BIRD:

applying -- adopting the statute of limitations --

17
18
19
20
21
22

23

I understand that, but I think

QUESTION:

What rule have we applied there, do

MR. BIRD:

As I understand it, the antitrust

you think?

rule is -- runs from the date of injury.
QUESTION:

Yes, so -- and if this action, RICO

is patterned after that, why shouldn't it be the same?
MR. BIRD:

Because the rule of accrual is

24

different than the statute of limitations, and I think

25

that the rule of accrual that the Court selects must take

1

account of the elements, and one of the unique elements of

2

RICO is pattern, and that's not -- that doesn't exist in

3

the antitrust laws.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Bird, as I understand it the

5

principal difference between your case and others is the

6

principal problem that you have is the identification of

7

the source, and in Clayton Act cases generally it's known

8

who it is, but here, it isn't a question of injury or

9

pattern, it's a question of, you didn't know the source,

10
11

and that's why I found your argument rather puzzling.
It seemed to me the Eighth Circuit test, which

12

was injury and source, discovery of injury and source plus

13

pattern was the rule, and that your disagreement really

14

was about the identification of the source, because if

15

those three elements are there, then on -- as I understand

16

your claim, you would be within the statute.

17

MR. BIRD:

Yes, we would.

We are -- we claim

18

that under whatever rule this Court selects we think we're

19

within it, but the fact remains that the Klehrs were not

20

able to identify the source of their injury, and they did

21

everything within their power.

22

QUESTION:

And that's the whole thing of your

23

case is they knew they were hurt, and then they knew that

24

there had been all this advertising, but they didn't

25

connect the pattern with the source of the injuries.

MR. BIRD:

1

That's correct.

They did not connect

2

the pattern with the source of the injury.

3

larger question here should the Court choose to address

4

it, and that is, why should this Court or Congress be

5

interested at all in granting repose to a criminal

6

enterprise that's engaged in a long-term continuous

7

pattern of felonious activity?
QUESTION:

8

9

question.

But there is a

Well, of course, that assumes the

Part of the statute of limitations design is so

10

that people that are not guilty of being in a criminal

11

activity have the evidence that's fresh to rebut your

12

allegation.

13

MR. BIRD:

And that is true, but if -- if --

14

let's assume that the RICO plaintiff is able to establish

15

that and meets the pattern element, which is a strict

16

element that this Court has imposed under the H.J. case,

17

two acts are not necessarily enough.

18

We need continuity plus relationship, and if we

19

assume, for example, a 30-year pattern and somebody suing

20

on the act that takes place in the first year and he can

21

pass that hurdle of identifying a pattern, which under

22

most circuits needs to be pled, then what's happened is we

23

have a 30-year pattern of criminal felonious conduct that

24

nobody's stepped up to the plate to stop, and I think

QUESTION:

1

I wouldn't have that problem if I

2

wouldn't allow the first suit, right?

You're back to that

3

issue again, whether the first person has a RICO cause of

4

action.

5

MR. BIRD:

And --

6

QUESTION:

I'll give you 10 years, not 30.

7

MR. BIRD:

Well, of course, the definition --

8

QUESTION:

That is the distance between the

9

first predicate act and the second, so the person who is

10

injured 10 years later after the first one clearly has a

11

RICO cause of action, and the first predicate act occurred

12

10 years ago.

13

That's the outside time of it, isn't it?

MR. BIRD:

What I -- of course, I tried to

14

address that, and what I'm saying is that once we are able

15

to identify the pattern, that is -- and understand what

16

I'm saying here is that being able to identify a pattern

17

is only a matter of perception, and that means that we

18

have a judge or an attorney or a RICO plaintiff saying,

19

I'm looking back in time, and what is -- what can I

20

perceive from what's gone on in the past, and that

21

implies, of course, discovery.

22

facts from which you should conclude --

23

25

QUESTION:

You're in possession of

It seems to me your clients were

incredibly obtuse not to have discovered this.
MR. BIRD:

Well, I disagree with that.

I

1

disagree with that, and I certainly think a fact question

2

exists, and the mere fact that the silo may not have met

3

their economic expectations does not necessarily cause

4

them to question the underlying concept that -- of oxygen

5

limiting, which was the basis for the sale here.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Bird, I agree that all of the

7

elements have to have been in existence, as Justice

8

O'Connor suggested, but why do you think all of the

9

elements have to be known, including the existence of the

10
11

pattern?
Let's take, you know, a garden variety tort

MR. BIRD:

No.

QUESTION:

-- the same 2-year statute for both?

24

MR. BIRD:

No.

QUESTION:

It's his problem.

Indeed, he didn't

1

know that it was intentional, and that made it a higher

2

species of tort, just as the -- a series of RICO

3

violations makes this a higher species of tort, but that's

4

too bad, so once he learned of the injury he should have

5

sued.
MR. BIRD:

6

I agree with your hypothetical that

7

that wouldn't extend the statute of limitations, but here

8

it's within his power to make that investigation and to

9

find out.
What we're dealing with here, and this is -- we

10
11

have a whole new way of attacking a problem, and I'm

12

suggesting that we can't get by with using what's termed

3

the traditional rules.

4

QUESTION:

No, but even on the traditional rule,

5

isn't it your position also that because one of the

6

elements is fraud, and because fraud at least will

7

normally be accorded a discovery rule, that therefore you

8

have until the point of reasonable discovery, even under

9

the traditional rule, or a traditional analysis, without

20

regard to the peculiarity of RICO itself.

21

position?

22

MR. BIRD:

Isn't that your

that is part of our position, but understand, the rule

24

we're advocating, which is the criminal last predicate

QUESTION:

1

Oh, I quite realize that, but if you

2

take the hypothetical that Justice Scalia gave you, and

3

you substitute for the intentional versus negligent act a

4

fraudulent act, I take it your position would be that even

5

though so far as the element of failure to supply what

6

they offered or any conventional tort, as to that the

7

statute might run immediately.

8

fraudulent element I thought it was your position that the

9

statute would not run until the moment of reasonable

10

Nonetheless, as to the

discovery.

11

MR. BIRD:

That is true, as -- and that --

12

QUESTION:

So that you may very well lose the

13

case conceptually by the adoption of a Clayton kind of

14

analysis here, and yet if there were a traditional -- if

15

traditional treatment were given to the discovery aspect

16

of the fraudulent element, you might still be in court.

17

MR. BIRD:

Well --

18

QUESTION:

You might still go back and have

19
20
21

something to litigate.
MR. BIRD:

Yes.

Your answer to that -- the

answer to that question is yes.

22

The RICO plaintiff under our analysis is put

23

into a, sort of a classic catch 22, because all of the

24

circuits are requiring significant pleading not only in

25

terms of pattern but also identification of the underlying

Yes, but he wouldn't -- that wouldn't

help if the injury was within the statutory period.
MR. BIRD:

11

That's true.

It would not help if

12

the injury were in the statutory period, but the problem,

13

or the catch 22 may get him beyond that time before he can

QUESTION:

What is it -- is it your view, then,

17

the statute would run forever, there's no statute, or is

18

it 13 years, or what is it?

1

Well, all right, there's an act -- separate out the

20

problem of discovery, which I think is the same for any

21

fraud, so imagine everybody knows everything.

I mean, you say the last act.

Now, I'm hurt yesterday.

22

All right, now do I go

23

back for 1,000 years?

24

turns out that every 5 years they committed one act since

25

1 40.

I mean, this was the last act.

Do I go back to 1 40?

Is that your idea?

cause of action.
That rule does not apply to this case, because

the injury or, as a few courts have said, discovery of the

22

injury and the source of the injury, meaning who caused

23

it.

MR. ENNIS:

1

2

That's a different doctrine.

Now,

let me try to address that doctrine.
The doctrine of fraudulent concealment is not

3
4

applicable in the circumstances of this case for two

5

reasons.

6

doctrine only applies when the defendant's acts actually

7

conceal the elements of the claim.

8

between whether they can be self-concealing acts or

9

affirmative acts that conceal, but all courts agree the

3

There's a distinction

defendant's acts must conceal the elements of the claim.
Here, both lower courts found,

11

12

All courts agree -- all courts agree that the

viewing the

evidence most favorably to petitioners, defendants did not
commit any acts which concealed the elements of the --

4

QUESTION:

So in other words, if I'm thinking

5

conceptually, is this right, in cases like price-fixing or

6

fraud, it starts to run from the moment that you discovery

7

your injury, i.e., you wrote a bigger check.

8
9

Some courts say you also have to know the
source.

20

MR. ENNIS:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Which isn't hard to know.

But then,

22

if there is fraudulent concealment, as there often would

23

be in price-fixing or fraud, that tolls the statute.

MR. ENNIS:

If there is actual fraudulent

concealment, which has two components, first that the

Both lower courts found, and in fact nine

defendant's acts do actually conceal the elements of the
claim, the plaintiff must nevertheless be diligent, and if

12

a diligent plaintiff would nevertheless have discovered

the elements of the claim despite the defendant's acts of

fraudulent concealment, the doctrine of fraudulent

concealment does not apply.

Why do you say there's no actual

1

So why isn't that concealment of the

element of knowledge that it wasn't a properly working

4

MR. ENNIS:

First of all, as Justice Kennedy's

11

QUESTION:

Well, of course it does.

When you

get to the issue of whether there's concealment or not,
you're assuming there was a fraud.
MR. ENNIS:

Well, in this case the reason it

12

doesn't conceal, even if you assume it's a fraud, is that

13

the claims here are based on allegations that my client

14

misrepresented the benefits of this silo.

misrepresentations.

The lower courts found that long before, 6 years

19

of the representations on which they claim to rely had not

materialized, and there was nothing the defendants could

21

do to conceal that reality.

There's no concealment at all,

of the misrepresentations was that they would be able to

of facts not all of which are in the cert petition or the

7

the facts that the petitioners could simply have taken

feed from the silo to be tested, which is a normal,

regular thing that most farmers do at least twice a year,

10

which would have showed them that the feed from the silo

either was good quality or bad quality -- they didn't do

Congress understood that some of the patterns could take

Is there any parallel doctrine for

that, or is that unique to RICO?

that a RICO injury happens, and then the RICO pattern is

not mean you could not have a pattern of acts some of

RICO, because the last violation under the criminal rule,

10

or the last predicate act under the civil rule, don't have

11

to have injured the plaintiff at all.

12

have injured anyone at all.

13

They don't have to

Now, that makes no sense to use that rule, which

14

is adrift from concepts of injury, in civil RICO, where

15

Congress itself determined that the gravamen of a civil

16

RICO claim is injury and a specific kind of injury, injury

17

to the business or property of the plaintiff.

18

The fact that the last act might injure someone

19

else is totally irrelevant to the plaintiff's civil RICO

20

claim.

21

RICO should be tied directly to injury.

That's why any rule this Court adopts for civil

22

Now, there are other reasons that --

Although you acknowledge that it can

24

be tied to an injury to somebody else if the injured

plaintiff is the first one in the series of RICO acts.

Actually, the other plaintiff

Okay.

So to that extent you're

willing to buy into the criminal rule.
MR. ENNIS:

Well, to that limited extent,

11

Justice Scalia, but in the normal run of these cases,

12

particularly where you're talking about an ongoing pattern

13

of activity, the pattern would exist roughly at the same

14

time as the first injury.

15

The second reason why the rule we propose makes

16

more sense than later accruing rules is that it is more

17

consistent with the private Attorney General function of

18

civil RICO.

function, since the civil plaintiff can only recover his

own damages and cannot punish the defendant for any

injuries inflicted on others, is not financial.

QUESTION:

1

You don't ask for the more strict

rule of just, once the cause of action exists, that's it.

3

You start the statute running.

4

MR. ENNIS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ENNIS:

The Clayton rule, Justice O'Connor?
Right.
We don't ask for it, but of course

7

we'd be happy with it, since we would win under that rule.

8

This claim would have accrued in 1974, and it would be

9

barred in 1978, but we don't urge the Clayton rule for two

10
11

reasons.
One, the Clayton rule, although that's the basic

12

Clayton rule, that occurrence-of-injury rule has not

13

proved satisfactory even for all Clayton Act violations,

14

which are much narrower in scope than RICO violations, so

15

many Clayton courts have actually imposed different rules,

16

and we think it makes sense to have a single rule for RICO

17

that is broad enough to encompass all the acts that

18

violate RICO.

19

Second, frankly, we think that the Clayton rule

20

is a little harsher to plaintiffs than this remedial

21

statute was probably intended to be.

22

Congress probably presumed, if it presumed anything at

23

all, was that the general Federal accrual rule would

24

apply, and that rule is discovery of injury, and we don't

25

think that in the context of this statute there's anything

We think that what

1

in the text or purpose of RICO that would mean that

2

Congress would have intended a harsher rule for civil RICO

3

than the general Federal rule of accrual.
QUESTION:

4

Of course, if Congress was reading

5

our cases it would not have expected a Federal statute of

6

limitations to apply at all, much -MR. ENNIS:

9

Scalia.
QUESTION:

We came to that later, didn't we?

10

MR. ENNIS:

11

QUESTION:

12

If they'd read your dissent, Justice

Yes.
So I don't think it's very helpful to

talk about what Congress intended.

13

MR. ENNIS:

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. ENNIS:

No.

No, but putting entirely aside

16

congressional intent, in Federal courts it's judge-made

17

law almost always to adopt accrual rules, but those rules

18

are supposed to be consistent with and tied to the purpose

19

of the underlying statute, regardless of what the

20

congressional intent was, and for that reason we think

21

since civil RICO the distinguishing element is injury, it

22

should be discovery of injury that triggers the accrual.

23

Let me conclude by saying that the Havens Realty

24

case, which has been mentioned here in argument, actually

25

proves our point.

In Havens Realty -- it wasn't a unique

case, Justice Rehnquist, but in Havens Realty this Court

2

rejected the continuing violations doctrine when applied

3

to a claim that required proof of direct injury to the

4

plaintiff, a misrepresentation claim.
It found the continuing violation doctrine not

5

appropriate in that circumstance, only appropriate in the

quite different circumstance of discriminatory practices

which have indirect injury to the plaintiff even if they

9

do not directly injure the plaintiff.

That is not this
