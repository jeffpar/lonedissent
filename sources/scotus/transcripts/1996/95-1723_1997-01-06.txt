ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. SAUBER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Our client, Joanne Siragusa, possessed a debt

owed to her by her husband --

Because the interests seem to diverge

a little bit --

Are you also representing the trustee

in bankruptcy?

I think the application --- and I was a little curious about

how your argument was going to cover both.

on a conclusion of the bankruptcy, I think only applies to

2

her definition of injury at this point, and not to the

3

trustee's interest.

4

The -- her preexisting debt owed to her by her

5

husband was not part of the racketeering scheme and not

6

alleged to be so.

7

When he went into bankruptcy owing her somewhere

8

in the neighborhood of $1.4 million as a result of a

9

property settlement, that debt was a preexisting

10

legitimate debt unrelated to the racketeering activity as

11

alleged in the racketeering complaint.

12

QUESTION:

Well, could you tell us just

13

preliminarily please whether Vincent Siragusa has -- at

14

one point the bankruptcy order had discharged Vincent

15

Siragusa's debts.

16

19

MR. SAUBER:

Yes.

He received a statutory

preliminary discharge.
QUESTION:

Has that ever been -- has an order

come from the bankruptcy court changing that?

MR. SAUBER:

MR. SAUBER:

Yes.

I didn't see it.

QUESTION:

But what order issued from the

bankruptcy court reflecting any of that?
MR. SAUBER:

6

The -- there is an order.

I don't

7

believe it's in the record, but there is an order from the

8

bankruptcy court accepting the settlement which includes

9

giving up his discharge, so as of 1994 his preliminary

10

discharge was revoked.

MR. SAUBER:

I don't believe it's in this

record, no.

QUESTION:

A preliminary discharge is one

that -- could you explain that just very briefly?

17

MR. SAUBER:

Yes, sir.

The preliminary

18

discharge in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is granted within a

19

certain number of months as long as no one -- none of the

20

creditors of the trustee object.

fraud.

QUESTION:

3

That the discharge was obtained by

fraud?

4

MR. SAUBER:

Yes.

Joanne and the trustee filed

5

in May of 1989 an adversary complaint alleging that, among

6

other things, the discharge granted to Vincent

7

preliminarily was obtained by fraud.

8

found that that was the date on which Joanne was injured.

The Ninth Circuit

Our position is that her debt, her preexisting

10

debt was the same the day before she filed that complaint

11

as it was the day after.

13

It's a classic attempt to get out from under a legal

14

obligation to pay a debt.

Mr. Sauber, what's left of -- what

It was a discharge in bankruptcy, was

20

it not?

21

anybody to complain about in this case?

22

If that's been undone, what injury is there for

MR. SAUBER:

The -- there are two ways in which

23

Joanne can be injured by this bankruptcy fraud.

24

the debtor obtains a discharge of its -- of his obligation

25

to pay her.

That's now been removed.

One is if

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. SAUBER:

That's out.
Secondly, if she is forced to

3

accept at the end of the bankruptcy less than 100 percent

4

of the debt he owed her when he started this scheme, and

5

that reduction is caused by the racketeering activity,

6

that is her racketeering injury at that point.

7

QUESTION:

Well --

8

QUESTION:

Has that occurred?

9

MR. SAUBER:

Well, our position is that until

10

the bankruptcy is complete and over, whether or not she's

11

been injured, whether or not her preexisting non-RICO debt

12

has been affected by the racketeering activity cannot be

13

determined.

14

QUESTION:

15

that injury occurs?

16
17

MR. SAUBER:

And she has a cause of action before

She filed a protective cause of

action.

18

QUESTION:

But the very authority that you rely

19

on, Mr. Sauber, the Banker's Trust, says that such a claim

20

is not ripe, and the bottom line of that case was

21

dismissal, so I was frankly surprised that you were urging

22

to preserve your case, that no injury has yet occurred.

23

25

Well, if no injury has yet occurred, you have no
lawsuit.

2

concerned that she was in a jurisdiction that would not

3

accept the Banker's Trust line of cases, and she filed a

4

protective lawsuit on the assumption that -- on the fear

5

that one of the courts in her jurisdiction would find

6

differently.

7

QUESTION:

She was

I've no objection to dismissing this

8

without prejudice, but I don't know how it cannot be

9

dismissed if there has been no injury.
MR. SAUBER:

10

Well, there has been no injury to

11

Joanne if you accept our argument with respect to Banker's

12

Trust.

13

With respect to the trustee, who the Ninth

14

Circuit pegged as being injured in May of 1989, his case

15

is still related to the second question, whether or not

16

you decide that the proper approval rule in this -- for a

17

civil RICO case is an injury-in-pattern discovery rule.

18

If you decide that, then his -- the trustee's

19

injury in May of 1989 doesn't start the statute of

20

limitations ticking.

QUESTION:

When you say Banker's Trust, you're

referring to the Second Circuit case?
MR. SAUBER:

Yes, Your Honor.

That would only

5

apply to Joanne because by definition it assumes that the

6

bankruptcy is complete.

7

The record in this case stands that the Ninth

8

Circuit has concluded that the trustee was injured as of

9

May of 1989, and since he would be unaffected by --

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SAUBER:

How was he injured in May of 19 -The Ninth Circuit rests its

12

decision on the assumption that in May of 1989 Joanne and

13

the trustee recognized, because they filed their adversary

14

complaint, that her husband has tried to concoct a

15

bankruptcy scheme to get out from paying her the legal

16

obligation.

QUESTION:

How does that injury the trustee in

Were there two acts in this?

I thought what you're claiming in that complaint

20

is there is a person, and he owes some money to Joanne,

21

and she has a secured interest in some property, and he

22

figures out a way that he can get rid of that secured

23

interest because what he's going to do is go through

24

bankruptcy and the secured interest will disappear.

25

That's the whole thing.

different from the adversary complaint.

The racketeering

No.

He fraudulently transferred

his interest in his medical practice to other people.
That was the whole basis of the bankruptcy -QUESTION:

11

The assets were transferred,

and the

trustee therefore collected less money in the bankruptcy

That happened, is that not correct?

How much does it owe?

No, not to

How much money has the trustee lost as a result

3

of the scheme that you say involved a fraudulent transfer

MR. SAUBER:

If you take into account the

point has lost several hundred thousand dollars and that

Joanne, by definition, has also lost several hundred

thousand dollars.

By the fraud, or by the reduction in

value of the business?
MR. SAUBER:

12

Well, I think that it clearly is

the reduction in value of the business, but I think the

you mean something different, Mr. Sauber, I take it, than

the fraudulent conveyance?

3

MR. SAUBER:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Well -Surely you can answer it yes or no.

Either you do mean something different or you don't.
MR. SAUBER:

I mean something in addition to

7

that, his submission of false statements throughout the

8

bankruptcy as to his assets, and as to his intentions, but

9

basically, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, his attempt to transfer

10

his property, claim that he no longer has the assets to

11

pay off his debt to his wife, and to go through and obtain

12

a discharge.

13

That was the heart of the bankruptcy fraud.

But I still don't understand, is

there a separate claim somewhere that the

That was the

Now, it turned out that Joanne and the trustee

5

discovered in December of 1990 that this scheme also had

other potential victims.

7

QUESTION:

Can you tell me, what is the first

8

predicate act under RICO and what is the second, and what

9

was the date of each?

10

MR. SAUBER:

The earliest predicate acts alleged

11

in the complaint are the filing of the bankruptcy.

12

is a bankruptcy fraud as a predicate act, and there are

13

mail and wire frauds.

14

QUESTION:

There

The scheme alleged -What are the later predicate acts?

15

Does that suffice for a RICO violation, or do we need a

16

second predicate act?

17

MR. SAUBER:

No.

I think that suffices in that

18

there are more than two, but the second predicate act that

19

brings in the pattern is the defrauding of Vincent's

20

partners.

21

QUESTION:

And when did that occur?

QUESTION:

You say there cannot be a pattern

without a second victim?

QUESTION:

Well then, why couldn't there be a

3

pattern inferred from the multiple predicate acts before

the second victim even entered the picture?

7

MR. SAUBER:

There may have -- there may be such

a pattern, but in this case she alleged -QUESTION:

Well, if there is such a pattern, and

8

I thought your answer a moment ago was that there was,

9

then I would suppose that so far as the pattern

10

requirement for your cause of action it was satisfied

11

before anything was done to damage the medical partner.

12

MR. SAUBER:

No, I would disagree.

The pattern

13

that she alleges in the RICO complaint, the second part of

14

the RICO complaint, is that the scheme which she was a

15

victim of also served to defraud others.

16

QUESTION:

Yes -- yes, but if there are two

17

predicate acts insofar as she is concerned, the filing of

18

the bankruptcy petition and, second, the transfer of the

19

assets of the medical practice, that's enough to establish

20

a pattern as well.

21

MR. SAUBER:

QUESTION:

It may or it may not be.
Well, let's suppose it is, that we

think it is enough, and this other story about another

7

discloses here, and what's being alleged, and enough is

8

being alleged apparently to establish both a claimed

9

injury by her and a series of acts that would qualify as a

10

pattern.
MR. SAUBER:

11

I think that that really starts to

12

sound a little bit to us like overpleading in that

only thing that you can take from that is that the Ninth

Circuit found that the pattern alleged in the complaint

was not evident to her until December of 1990.

I had a problem with your brief, because you were

saying, we have a terrible problem here.

predicate act.

13

We had the first

Well, I kept asking myself, where is there a

14

RICO injury at all if there's no second predicate act at

15

the time the injury occurs?

16

MR. SAUBER:

There are -- Justice Kennedy, there

17

are a number of predicate acts alleged in the complaint.

18

The first injury from several predicate acts is only to

19

her.

20

In December of 1990, when she discovers that the

21

same scheme was designed to defraud others, it occurs to

22

her at that point that there is a pattern.

That is her --

MR. SAUBER:

No, but I do think that it was --

16

it's only fair to suggest that she would have a difficult

time proving continuity and relationship and threat of

continued activity if it was just a dispute between her

19

and her husband.

MR. SAUBER:

under no circumstances could a single scheme with multiple

predicate acts constitute a pattern.

What we are saying is that in this case the

did not constitute a pattern, and if I --

MR. SAUBER:

QUESTION:

MR. SAUBER:

Why?
Because there was only one victim.

I understand.

That is not

dispositive, but there was one victim for a short period

of time, and basically what it was was a dispute growing

19

out of a divorce case in which the husband tried to get

out of his obligations.

2

If the pattern is there, it seems to me the law is -- has

3

got to require the plaintiff to be nimble enough to see

4

it.

5

It just grew out of this domestic dispute.

MR. SAUBER:

But I think in fairness the way

6

that this Court has defined pattern and required the

7

plaintiff to find some sort of continuity and a

8

relationship, and the threat of continued criminal

9

activity, in the short period of time when she recognizes

10

that her husband has tried to defraud her out of her debt,

11

it would be our position that that is not sufficient for

12

her to conclude, even if she's omniscient, that there is

3
4

in fact a pattern.
QUESTION:

So if you have -- I think I agree

5

with you, but if I have a very complicated scheme to sell

you the Brooklyn Bridge -- you'd be too wise.

wouldn't buy it, but there are five or six others who

8

might buy it.

You

Now, suppose instead of one person buying it it

turns out five are putting up the money.

Is there

suddenly a RICO violation?

violation because the same activity hurt five people

rather than just one?

I

don't understand pattern here, in other words, which is

2

what's causing me the problem.

3

MR. SAUBER:

4

QUESTION:

Well -I don't understand why seven

5

complicated acts which lead to the sale of the Brooklyn

6

Bridge comprise two predicates, and I don't understand, if

7

they don't, why the fact that three people buy the

8

Brooklyn Bridge rather than one makes a difference for

9

RICO purposes.

10

MR. SAUBER:

Well, I think that it's the issue

11

that this Court dealt with in H.J., that the -- a single

12

scheme, even if there are a number of predicate acts

13

within a short period of time, where really in essence

14

it's a dispute between a husband and wife, doesn't

15

constitute the kind of continued criminal activity that

16

this Court contemplated when it defined a pattern.

17

QUESTION:

So you're saying, I think, in answer

18

to Justice Breyer it's when they sell the bridge twice,

not when they sell it once to five people.

becomes clear.

21

That's when it

most plaintiffs and practitioners would start to think of

actually about as it was pled before the district court

That is emphatically not the

QUESTION:

And what, strictly speaking, is an

adversary complaint in the bankruptcy -MR. LACOVARA:

It's in effect a civil claim that

8

is in some way related to the jurisdiction of the

9

bankruptcy court.

It's a claim that may be made either by

10

the trustee against a third party, or it may be made by an

outsider against the debtor and some third parties.

QUESTION:

And seeking some sort of remedy

against the assets of the bankrupt?
MR. LACOVARA:

Well, it can also be, as it was

15

in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, a request for a personal

16

remedy against individuals and, indeed, the individuals in

17

the bankruptcy case included the very respondents before

18

the court today, the lawyer defendants.

19

In May of 1989 Ms. Siragusa claimed that there

20

had been what she called a fraudulent course of conduct,

21

and if you look on page -- beginning on page 191 of the

22

joint appendix, beginning on paragraph 21, she then uses

23

this as a defined term.

allege, beginning in at least 19 -- July 1987,

approximately 2 years before this complaint was filed, a

QUESTION:

9

Mr. Lacovara, may I ask you to

10

clarify this?

As I understood the Ninth Circuit's

11

opinion, Judge Hall's opinion, she said there's a statute

12

of limitations question here, and my circuit's position

13

for 10 years has been injury, whether or not you know it's

14

a pattern.

15

MR. LACOVARA:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Other circuits have the injury plus

pattern.

complaint would be timely, but, she said, our rule is

injury, period.

20

22

If the Ninth Circuit had that rule, this

Am I wrong in understanding that that's what
Judge Hall said?
MR. LACOVARA:

I think Judge Hall left open the

23

question whether or not the petitioner would prevail under

24

the injury-plus-pattern recognition point.

25

Our argument today, however, is as the colloquy

with several of the justices has indicated, even under

that rule -- that's the third of the fourth that the

briefs frame -- this case had to be dismissed, because

petitioner --

6

QUESTION:

But that's not something that the

Ninth Circuit dealt with.

7

MR. LACOVARA:

8

QUESTION:

9

That's correct.

The Ninth Circuit said, our rule, in

contrast to the rule in other circuits, is simply injury,

10

and it doesn't matter that you didn't know at that point

11

there was any pattern.
MR. LACOVARA:

12

13

That's correct, but I do want to

say - -

14

QUESTION:

And on what you're telling us now, it

15

seems like this isn't the right case for us to decide that

16

question.

17

MR. LACOVARA:

Well, I can only speak as the

18

respondent.

19

I can say that the Court appears to have taken certiorari

20

to decide, in the existence of a real conflict, what the

21

correct accrual rule is in civil RICO claims.

22

We opposed certiorari, Justice Ginsburg, and

There are three rules that we think clearly bar

23

this complaint.

24

that's the Third Circuit's last predicate act rule -- is

25

the only one that would save it.

The fourth one, only the fourth one --

The one that we think,

1

as even the petitioner in her brief seems to recognize,

2

would clearly command affirmance here, and we think is the

3

correct rule, is the pure Clayton Act accrual rule.

4

QUESTION:

But I thought that the debate between

5

the parties was not about the Third Circuit rule but

6

between the injury or injury-plus-pattern rules.

7

MR. LACOVARA:

Well, in -- up through the Ninth

8

Circuit, since Ninth Circuit law was quite clear, it was

9

sufficient to argue that petitioner's RICO complaint was

10

barred by the Ninth Circuit's injury discovery principle,

11

but now in this Court I take it that the issue before you

12

is, what is the right rule to lay down for all civil RICO

13

claims whether or not it's the one that was adopted --

14

QUESTION:

Well, and there's another aspect to

15

the rule.

16

should have known of the injury and/or the pattern, or do

17

we just look at whether there was actual knowledge?

16

Do we look at whether the plaintiff knew or

MR. LACOVARA:

Well, I think the way the injury

IS

rule has been defined, it's either an actual or imputed or

2C

constructive injury.

21

this to get lost in the discussion.

22

the one that we think is correct is the Clayton Act

23

accrual rule which petitioner acknowledges has no

24

injury -- has no knowledge or discovery element.

25

3

Exactly, or even actual

knowledge.
QUESTION:

And yet, in circumstances where fraud

4

is an element, the courts have fairly often applied the

5

should-have-known thing, and RICO often involves claims

6

that turn on fraud.

7

MR. LACOVARA:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, but that

8

was an argument that was specifically rejected, or the

9

implication of that argument was specifically rejected in

10

Agency Holding v. Malley-Duff, in which the Court said the

11

proper statute of limitations for civil RICO cases is not

12

the fraud statute, even if it happens to be a fraud

13

predicate that's invoked in a particular case.

14

Congress, when it fashioned the civil RICO

15

section, specifically borrowed the pattern from the --

16

section 4 of the Clayton Act, and the Court held therefore

17

we will borrow the section 4 of the Clayton Act statute of

18

limitations, and the reason I say that that should make

19

this an easy case to dispose of is that it's been settled

20

since 1919, including by this Court in Zenith v.

21

Hazeltine, as the petitioner acknowledges in her brief,

22

that the -- there is no discovery principle at all under

MR. LACOVARA:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LACOVARA:

That's a tolling doctrine.

Yes.
And we concede that under any

4

principle of accrual there will be a tolling if there's

5

been active concealment designed to mislead the potential

6

claimant into believing that she has no claim.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Lacovara, what troubles me about

8

just applying the Clayton Act rule is that the Clayton Act

9

does not have a provision like RICO which refers to

10

predicate acts, the last of which occurred within 10 years

11

after the commission of a prior act of racketeering

12

activity.

13

I -- there's some problem, it seems to me, of

14

reconciling a sudden death knowledge of the -- or injury

15

rule with the obvious expectation in this statute that

16

there would be a long lapse of time of 10 years between

17

predicate acts that are the basis of the suit.

18

MR. LACOVARA:

I don't think that that's

19

necessarily a necessary assumption in the statute.

20

Congress has done is to say, it may be possible to look to

21

predicate acts taking place as far apart as over a 10-

22

year period to determine whether or not there has been a

23

pattern of racketeering.

24
25

But in the H.J. case, in which the Court
unanimously agreed that all the pattern requirement

What

1

requires is some relationship between or among the

2

predicate acts and the threat of continuing criminal

3

activity, it is unlikely that a predicate act in year one

4

and a predicate act in year 10 would show a sufficient

5

continuity to give rise to a pattern.
But the point is, Justice Scalia, that only

6

7

relates to whether or not a civil RICO claim arises.

8

don't think it really has any bearing on when the claim

9

should be viewed as accruing for purposes of a statute of

10

I

limitations.
QUESTION:

11

But on that point you do tell us that

12

in this -- this is an academic case, because whether you

13

apply your rule, which is injury, or injury plus pattern,

14

this complaint is untimely, and if we take that view, then

15

we can say, well, we haven't got a real case to deal with

16

any more, since either rule would lead to the same

17

judgment.

18

MR. LACOVARA:

Well, that's conceivable.

I

19

would not suggest that on this ground a disposition that

20

applies what we consider the correct rule, which is the

21

Clayton Act no discovery principle, or even the Ninth

22

Circuit's discovery of injury principle, would be academic

23

or moot, even though the plaintiff -- the petitioner would

24

also lose under the pattern discovery principle because

25

she knew as of May 1989 that there had been, according to

3

Under your proposed rule, does there

have to have been the pattern in existence when the injury

MR. LACOVARA:

7

That's a debatable question.

8

think Justice Breyer raised that question, whether the

9

injury must take place after the pattern.
QUESTION:

10

I

Well, otherwise it's a very strange

11

statute you have, because it allows you 10 years between

4 years go by, the statute has run, and then the second

here, because she -- the injury that she alleges, and I

would like to cite to the passages where she describes her

I think under the discussion

I was having with Justice Scalia there would not be a RICO

I don't see the need for that.

is to say, why couldn't a person who burns down somebody's

13

MR. LACOVARA:

On the basis of the complaint

14

that she filed -- the civil RICO complaint, and let's turn

15

to that, she alleges as of 1993 various kinds of losses

16

and injuries, and these are injuries that she said she

17

incurred in 1987 when the fraudulent transfers defeated

18

her security interest, her lien, which is property under

19

Nevada law, and prevented her from foreclosing on the

20

business and realizing what she later claimed to be

21

$6 million worth of profits that she would have been able

22

to earn if she'd been allowed to foreclose in 1987.

23

The other tangible injury that she alleged in

24

this complaint, and I refer you to page 47 of the joint

25

appendix and to page 70 of the joint appendix, in which

she itemizes the "losses suffered in the Siragusa medical

practice interest scheme," she says the losses currently

exceeding -- currently as of 1993 exceeding $6 million,

4

the failure to receive the marital payment, that's the

$1.3 million judgment that she had obtained against

6

Vincent in September of 1987, and the impairment of her

ability to execute and foreclose on Siragusa's medical

practice as a result of the alleged fraudulent transfer in

1987 .
So as she alleged a civil RICO claim with a

pattern of racketeering, which is detailed, Justice

Breyer, in five exhibits attached to this prolix

QUESTION:

I see

MR. LACOVARA:

-- $1.4 million verdict.

But

3

the -- since the time the original litigation began, as

4

the record shows, and we have attached as an appendix to

5

the Beckley Singleton respondent's brief, the petitioner

6

has received approximately $1.9 million as the result of

7

the settlement with Dr. Bowers, as the result of the

8

redefined alimony award to replace the discharged marital

9

payment and the $200,000 or so that Vincent paid in 1994

10
11

12

13

when he settled the case.
Now, petitioner says maybe she's entitled to
more than that because maybe she has a claim of interest.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Sauber said she's entitled

14

to several thousand more than that, and you're not

15

disputing -- that maybe right and that may be wrong, but

16

there's a controversy about it, is there not?

17

MR. LACOVARA:

I think it would be hard to say

18

without knowing whether interest was running on her

19

original $1.3 million judgment from 1987, and if so at

20

what rate, but it does look as if she has been at least

made more than whole.

1

courts, and this Court has never addressed this, is that

2

the treble damage, the trebling takes place on the damage

3

award that the jury renders and therefore, if the victim

4

in a financial case has been made whole before trial, then

5

there's nothing to treble, so the trebling doesn't arise

6

in the air.

7

and so if she has been made whole the lower court cases

8

suggest there is no basis for a RICO trebling.

9

It only arises as a calculation on a verdict,

But the other point that I would make about the

10

posture of the case in this Court, and this is the other

11

basis for possibly treating it either as moot or as

2

recognizing that there isn't any claim, in her opening

certainly doesn't mean, as Justice Souter's opinion for

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD SAUBER

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SAUBER:

7

I want to make three points

8

quickly.

Number 1, Joanne still has not received her $1.4

9

million that was the debt when Vincent went into

10

bankruptcy.

Some of that money went to the trustee,

11

others of it went to the estate.

12

her full amount.

She's still not received

In answer, Justice Ginsburg, to your question

13
14

about Judge Hall's opinion, it's clear that Judge Hall

15

agreed with our rendition of what the pattern was because

16

she decided in her opinion that if the Ninth Circuit

17

decided that the injury-and-pattern discovery rule was

18

applicable, the cause of action in this case would be

19

timely.

20

QUESTION:

But she could assume that without --

21

that wasn't what was before her.

22

the pattern didn't exist until that later date, still this

23

complaint is not timely because it's when she knew or

24

should have known she was injured.

25

MR. SAUBER:

She could say, even if

Yes, but I think in choosing

1

between those two rules the Ninth -- Judge Hall and the

2

Ninth Circuit clearly decided that had they gone the other

3

way and chosen the injury-and-pattern discovery rule, her

4

complaint would have been timely, and it's not an issue in

5

this case when the second pattern occurred.
Our argument is when a plaintiff can reasonably

6

7

be said to be on notice that a pattern has occurred, which

8

is one of the key elements and one of the unique elements

9

of this statute.
In answer, Justice Scalia, to your question and

10
11

Justice Breyer's question, an injury discovery rule with a

12

racketeering statute is completely unworkable for this

13

reason.

act.

and yet the cause of action doesn't exist.

of being diligent --

A plaintiff may be injured by the first predicate

At that point she is now on notice, inquiry notice,

QUESTION:

18

MR. SAUBER:

19

QUESTION:

So now instead

Yes, but may I interrupt?
Yes.
You're assuming the answer to

20

something your opponent thinks we need not decide.

21

assuming that a person can't have a RICO cause of action

22

based on an injury before the statute was violated.

23

MR. SAUBER:

24

QUESTION:

25

You're

I'm sorry, say that again.
You're assuming that a plaintiff may

have a RICO cause of action based on an injury that

occurred before the statute was violated.
MR. SAUBER:

2

No,

I'm not assuming that at all,

3

and let me explain.

4

adopting an injury discovery rule that is completely

5

unworkable, and that's our point.
QUESTION:

6

If -- it really is a question of

But if we add a version to that, that

7

discovery or the second thing occurs, whichever comes

8

later.

9

MR. SAUBER:

Right, and if you take the fact

10

that the first predicate act is the discovery that you've

11

been injured by the first predicate act, and the pattern

12

or the other predicate acts come later, you've in essence

13

created two classes of plaintiffs.

14

QUESTION:

No.

You're still saying -- I'm

15

suggesting to you that you're assuming you can have a RICO

16

cause of action before the violation occurs.

17

MR. SAUBER:

Absolutely. That -- I'm not

18

assuming that, but that is the problem with the injury

19

discovery rule.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

That's not the rule your friend is

arguing, by the way. He's arguing for an injury rule.
MR. SAUBER:

He's arguing for an injury rule

23

which in our view is completely inappropriate to the

24

racketeering statute, which has as many of the predicate

25

acts fraud claims, which this court has already decided in

1

Holmberg v. Yonquist means that in a fraud claim you must

2

be able to discover the fraud before the statute of

3

limitations starts running.

4

When you lay on top of that a requirement to

5

discover and plead a pattern, and all of the difficulties

6

and the intricacies in both defining and finding a

7

pattern, you really have created a cause of action which

8

by its nature is a fraud case, by its nature is a case

9

that has as some of its elements concealment and

10

continuity, and it seems unfair to say that the statute of

11

limitations, when you're required to plead all of those

12

elements, starts to tick before --
