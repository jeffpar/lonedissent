ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Section 924(c) (1) of title 18 provides for

11

mandatory jail sentences for persons who use or carry a

12

firearm during the commission of certain offenses.

13

Tenth Circuit in this case held that a sentence imposed

14

under section 924(c) by a Federal district court may be

15

made to run concurrently with a State sentence that the

16

defendant is already serving.

17

for three reasons.

18

The

In our view, that is wrong

First and foremost, the language of the statute

19

expressly forbids the imposition of a concurrent sentence.

20

Second, we think the court of appeals was wrong to imply a

21

presumption that that prohibition refers solely to

22

previously imposed Federal sentences, and finally, we

23

think the Tenth Circuit was wrong to rely on a passage

24

from the 1984 Senate committee report that accompanied the

25

1984 amendments to section 924(c).

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, do you take the position

2

that section 924(c) requires the separate sentence given

3

for that violation to run before any other sentence, or

4

could it be required after any other sentence?

5

the statute refers to is running sentences concurrently,

6

so is it okay to order its service after the expiration of

7

a State court penalty?

8

MR. ESTRADA:

9

back up.

Just, what

Yes, Justice O'Connor, but let me

Under the sentencing statutes that we have, how

10

the sentence is administered is usually up to the Bureau

11

of Prisons.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

And you don't take the position that

it has to always be first?
MR. ESTRADA:

No, and in many circumstances it

15

will not be able to be first.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR . ESTRADA:

Right.

Okay.

In this case, for example, in

18

order to give effect to both the statutory authority to

19

make the drug sentences concurrent with the State terms

20

and to the statutory mandate that the 924 sentence be

21

consecutive, the Bureau of Prisons would have to run the

22

Federal drug sentence first, concurrent with the State

23

sentence, and to run the 924(c) sentence last, consecutive

24

to both State and Federal sentences.

25

There was an assumption in the court of appeals'

l

view that that would not be so because it gave what we

2

think was inordinate weight to its view of the Senate

3

conunittee report, but that is, in fact, an error.
As a matter of the administration of the

4

5

sentence, under section 3584(c), I believe, the Bureau of

6

Prisons would treat the entire term imposed by the Federal

7

court as a single administrative term that has several

8

parts, and the part that would correspond to the Federal

9

drug sentences in this case would be ordered -- would be

10

served concurrently with the existing State sentences.

11

The part that corresponds to section 924(c), as

12

required by the plain language of the statute, would be

13

made consecutive both to Federal sentences and to the

14

State sentences that are already being served.
QUESTION:

15
16

that?

17

is first.

tell the States when their sentence is going to run in

QUESTION:

No .

Or is there some control on that

discretion?

The State sentence is independent.

1

our view speaks solely to a Federal question, how a

2

Federal court imposing a Federal sentence for a Federal

3

crime, may order the calculation of the Federal sentence.

4

QUESTION:

My question was, does the Bureau of

5

Prisons have discretion to say in a particular case to the

6

State, we're going to allow all the Federal sentences to

7

run first, and then you can do whatever you want, or,

8

we're going to require that part of our sentence be

9

served, then part of your sentence served, then the

10

remaining part of ours, or can -- is there -- does

11

there some supremacy principle where the Federal

12

Government can direct this if the States object?

13

14

MR. ESTRADA:

is

Not in those terms, Justice

Kennedy.

15

There is a case from this Court, Punsey v.

16

Fessenden, which is at 258 U.S. 254, which encompasses a

17

principle of primary jurisdiction, which is that each of

18

the two sovereigns, State and Federal, may lend someone to

19

the other Government so he may be tried, yet choose not to

20

relinquish him for the service of the other sovereign

21

sentence until they choose to, but under the statutes that

22

we have, we would not take the view that we can break up a

23

term of imprisonment and to tell the States how to do

24

anything.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, I can agree with your -6

1

with the Government's position that the statute as written

2

does not compel the States to make their sentences

3

nonconcurrent, but why is it not the case that, after

4

you've had the Federal sentence imposed and then a State

5

sentence is imposed and the State says, well, we're not

6

bound by this Federal statute, we will have this run

7

concurrently with the Federal sentence, why does not the

8

Federal sentence at that point become in violation of the

9

statute, because it is now a sentence that is being served

10
11

concurrently with another sentence.
MR. ESTRADA:

That view might have some weight,

12

Justice Scalia, if all there were to this statute would be

13

the single clause, nor shall any sentence be made.

14

In context, it seems clear to us that the

15

statute speaks to the duty of the Federal sentencing court

16

at the time it imposed the sentences to impose a sentence

17

based on the facts then existing, as is true with Federal

18

sentencing statutes generally.

19

Federal court complied with that duty at the time it

20

imposed sentence, any subsequent court that is not bound

21

by that duty would be in no breach and, as a result, it

22

would not be any violation of the statute.

23

Therefore, given that the

Quite simply, if you take the language of the

24

statute that says, notwithstanding any other provision of

25

law the court shall not suspend the sentence or do any of

1

these other things that a sentencing court would do, or,

2

nor shall the sentence be made concurrent, in that context

3

the natural reading is that the statute speaks to the

4

duties of the Federal sentencing court as sentencing

5

statutes usually do at the time sentence is imposed.

QUESTION:

Then everything•s going to turn on

whose sentence is first.

QUESTION:

MR. ESTRADA:

10
11
12

QUESTION:

That's right.
Excuse me, Justice --

Then everything -- then the result is

simply going to turn on whose sentence is first.
If they do a State sentence first, then, in

13

effect, you get the policy carried out when the Federal

14

sentencing follows it.

15

effect the State can negate the policy by saying

16

everything we impose is going to run concurrent, including

17

the premium, yes.

18

MR. ESTRADA:

If the Feds sentence first, in

There are two answers to that

19

question, Justice Souter.

The first one is that the

20

policy of the statute is that the sentence that is imposed

21

under section 924(c) be made consecutive to any other

22

sentence that the defendant might be serving.

23

always the case, where a sentence is made consecutive to

24

another sentence, that any number of circumstances, for

25

example, might change the first sentence.

It is

1

All that Congress can do is to say this is what

2

the Federal court may make the sentence at the time of

3

sentencing, and until and unless Congress chooses to go

4

forward and to say that this is a national policy, not of

5

instruction to the Federal courts about how to do their

6

business, but of instruction also to the State courts

7

about how to do theirs, the statute simply doesn't speak

8

to the question.

9

QUESTION:

So I guess you would say that the

10

State could -- let's

it imposes its sentence first.

11

The Federal sentence comes up second, and the sentencing

12

judge says, well, this cannot run concurrent, so it will

13

be consecutive, and then he goes back to the State court

14

and says, in light of, you know, what the Feds have done,

15

please make my State sentence run concurrent with the

16

Federal sentence, and the State says, that's fine.

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia. and the same would be true if he went back

received an unduly long sentence, would you please

2

exercise your discretion under State law to make my State

3

sentence go away, and to thereby remove the predicate for

4

the consecutive sentence in the Federal court.

5

I'm not saying that that would effectuate the

6

Federal policy to the fullest possible extent that one

7

might take such a policy, but under the terms of this

8

statute as written, it would, because the policy, as we

9

have explained, is one that speaks to the actions of the

10

Federal sentencing court when imposing sentence, and it is

11

that court --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, that's certainly a

13

reasonable interpretation, but it's not what the statute

14

says.

15

or are you just making a very sensible construction of the

16

statute?

Do you think -- you say that's a literal reading,

17

MR. ESTRADA:

18

QUESTION:

19

Oh, I think both, Justice Stevens.

Because it says -- it's a flat

prohibition, as Justice Scalia pointed out.
MR. ESTRADA:

20

Well, as I indicated to Justice

21

Scalia, Justice Stevens, it is our view, and we think it's

22

right --

That it should be read that way.
No.

on context, and if all we had to go to -- through were a

2

Federal statute that says, anyone who has been sentenced

3

for a firearms charge shall never have a concurrent

4

sentence, and there was nothing else to the statute, that

5

might give rise to the issue of whether that binds the

6

State courts as well .

8

crime and then makes a direction to the court not to

13

different language.

It doesn't say that.

It doesn't say

It says, nor shall the term of imprisonment

imposed under this subsection run concurrently with any

16

other term of imprisonment, and so as soon as the State

17

decides later to have a concurrent State sentence, this

18

term, the term imposed under this section, will begin to

run concurrently with the State sentence.

I have two answers to your

question , Justice Scalia.

The first one is that I agree

reading would ignore what comes earlier in the statute,

2

The second answer is that, as we --

QUESTION:

Before you go to the second, and I

want you to get there, what is it earlier in the statute

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

18

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes.
which is that the language that

19

Justice Scalia read in isolation, which we concede would

20

bear that reading, doesn't really have a subject, and it

21

is part of a sentence that starts with, the court shall

to read the court as the Federal court, as the subject

I mean, anyway, most sentencing

statutes are phrased in the passive voice or refer to the

defendant.

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

all other sentencing statutes this is meant to talk about
the obligation of the judge.

They don't say, the judge shall do this.

Of the general court, that is

correct.

13

QUESTION:

But this one is phrased that way.

QUESTION:

But that cuts the other way because

15

the first part of the sentence talks about what the court

16

may do --

In the active voice.
and then the second part is

broader.

MR. ESTRADA:

1

which is in essence that you have to infer a subject for

2

the clause in the passive voice and that, given that the

3

very same sentence starts with a clause in the active

4

voice the more reasonable reading, even if it would bear

5

another, is that the subject is that of the Federal court.

6

I would like to have a --

7

QUBSTION:

8

What principle says that you must

infer a subject for a sentence in the passive voice?
MR. ESTRADA:

9

10

QUESTION:

Well

Is that a principle of grammar, or

11

something?

If it's in the passive voice it simply means

12

the term of imprisonment imposed shall not run

13

concurrently.

14

MR. ESTRADA:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ESTRADA:

Well --

You don't need a subject for it.
This case -- excuse me.

17

Court has had cases in which similar grammatical

18

difficulties have been present, Justice Scalia.

19

This

In the Wilson case, I think, which is cited in

20

our brief and which also deals with how Federal sentences

21

are administered, the Court had before it a statute that

22

also was written in the passive voice and the question

23

then was, does this give a right or a duty to the

24

sentencing court or to the BOP, and the Court went into

25

the context of the statute and to some extent into the

1

history to conclude that it did not give any rights or

2

duties to the sentencing courts, but it confided the

3

duties to be carried out under the statute to the Bureau

4

of Prisons alone, and I think that that's not an unusual

5

act of statutory interpretation.

6

I don't want to let go of the second point

7

QUESTION:

You still have the second point.

The

8

first point, you're assuming that the words, the term of

9

imprisonment, are not the subject, aren't you?

10

MR. ESTRADA:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. ESTRADA:

13

Yes.

Well, yes.

Yes .
I mean, you can put it that way,

but I think --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ESTRADA:

Some grammarians migh t disagree.
Well, and I think -- and I really

16

will concede, Justice Stevens, that if all I had were an

17

independent freestanding sentence that began with the term

18

of imprisonment, this might raise a different question.

19

To just touch upon our -- or, our second point

20

is that to the extent the language would bear another

21

reading, and to the extent that you might read the

22

language in isolation as speaking to the duties of State

23

courts imposing sentences under State law, there is a

24

section that is also part of the Gun Control Act, section

25

you would have to concede is that the statute continues to

statute in that way, and we have no intention of applying

2

it that way.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, do you know of any

4

Federal criminal sentencing statute that controls State

5

courts without saying so?

6

process one would expect Congress at least to speak with a

7

clear voice that it is attempting to control what the

8

State does.

9

MR. ESTRADA:

To affect the State's criminal

I think that you are right,

10

Justice Ginsburg, in that to the extent Congress ever

11

tries to control the processes of State courts applying

12

State law and tell them what to do, that fairly

13

interesting and maybe difficult federalism issues would

14

come up that may call that as one of the principles.

15

One of the interesting facets of this case is

16

that there is a general statute that governs whether

17

Federal courts may impose sentences that are concurrent or

18

consecutive, section 3584 , which is quoted both in our

19

opening brief and in our reply brief.

20

In our reply brief I believe the pertinent part

21

is quoted at page 4, footnote 2.

That is the general

22

residual Federal statute that deals with the question

23

whether a Federal court may impose a concurrent sentence

24

or a consecutive sentence, and the statute that

25

respondents urge should be applied to them here.

1

Now, the interesting thing about that statute is

2

that even though it authorizes a concurrent term of

3

imprisonment , it doesn't speak to State terms of

4

imprisonment at all, so that if one were to take the rule

5

of construction being urged for here, the logical

6

consequence would be that there is no statutory authority

7

for the imposition of a concurrent term of imprisonment.

So you think that this statute means

the view that I gather you would instinctively take of how

3

that case should turn out.

4

The Court in that case took

In 1984 Congress turned around and said no, we

5

didn't mean that, and overruled in effect for future cases

6

the outcome in Busic and as a result of that change the

7

statute now reads that the mandatory s-year sentence may

8

apply to any offense, including one that has an

9

enhancement for a firearm .

10
11

QUBSTION:

Including the firearm.

Not may, but

must, you mean?

12

MR. BSTRADA:

Mm-hmm.

That is right, and it's

13

very plain from the legislative history that accompanied

14

the 1984 amendments that Congress was unhappy with the

15

outcome in Busic and changed the statute just to make that

16

possible.

17

QUBSTION:

18

MR. BSTRADA:

Thank you.
And the relevant language that

19

does that is at the top of page 2 in our brief, where

20

Congress added a parenthetical that reads, including a

21

crime of violence or drug trafficking crimes which

22

provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the

23

use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.

MR. ESTRADA:

It does, and that was one of the

issues that the Court had before it in the Busic and

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Estrada, you answered some of the

6

questions from Justice Scalia or Justice Stevens about the

7

scope of the nor shall clause by saying it occurs in a

8

sentence which is addressed to Federal sentences, and that

9

provides the context.

10

Why should we confine our contextual reference

11

to sentences?

12

sort of a section-based contextualism, and the principle

13

address of the section , I suppose, is to Federal

14

sentencing and the relationships of Federal sentences, so

15

if we're going to look at context, why don't we look at it

16

more broadly than you would and find that a reason not to

17

apply the any sentence reference to State sentences?

18

why don't we approach this case with a --

MR . ESTRADA:

You see, I think, Justice Souter,

19

that I do not disagree with your statement up to the very

20

last clause, which is that it is true that this is a

21

statute that applies only to Federal sentencings, but one

22

of the things it does is to instruct a Federal court as to

23

how the sentence should be imposed and, by extension, the

24

Federal Bureau of Prisons as to how the sentence should be

25

administered, and it is to them that the instruction goes,

It doesn't act on a State court, and it doesn't

No, but your --- takes that as a point of

reference for Federal officials discharging their duties

8

under Federal law.

9

QUESTION:

Oh, I grant you that, but I thought

10

your answer to the question about the nor shall clause was

11

not that it could not be addressed or effectively be

12

enforced against a State court.

13

We'll leave that aside.

14

That's a separate issue.

Your answer was in the context we can infer that

15

it's not being addressed, and don't we have sort of no

16

more or less ambiguity when we get to the reference to any

17

sentence being served?

18

MR. ESTRADA:

Oh, I see.

No, for two reasons.

19

The first one is that the first sentence of this very

20

statute uses the expansive language, any crime, and goes

21

on expressly to qualify it by reference to only crimes

22

that are Federal crimes and when the same expansive

23

language, any crime or offense or sentence is used in the

24

first sentence of the statute and does not so

25

Yes, that gives that -24

(800) FOR DBPO

l

MR. ESTRADA:

-- restrict it, there is a fair

2

inference that Congress did not mean the qualifications

3

then .

4

The second answer to that is the answer that I

5

started to give to Justice Ginsburg concerning section

6

3584, which is a residual statute that governs concurrency

7

and consecutivity, and it does not itself make reference

8

to State sentences either.

9

As a historical matter, before the statute was

10

passed in section 19 - - in 1984, the rule in the Federal

ll

courts was that a Federal sentence could not be concurrent

12

with a State sentence, and the legislative history of

13

section 3584 makes clear that one of the things that

14

section - - that the residual statute meant to do with

15

unqualified reference to terms of imprisonment that don't

16

mention State law was to allow Federal courts, when

17

otherwise appropriate, to impose a sentence that would be

18

concurrent to a State term .

19

QUESTION:

Well, I think your answer is a fair

20

answer , but I guess I have one follow-up question to it,

21

and that is, if there is any question about whether your

22

answer is sort of dispositive, isn't it fair to look to

23

the point that was brought out earlier, and that is that

24

on your theory there's sort of a game of chance going on,

25

because if the

l

sentence had not been imposed first, the result would be

2

different here, and rather than allow this statute to be

3

administered in a way that is going to turn it into a game

4

of chance, which sentence -- depending on which sentencer

5

gets there first, why isn't it more reasonable to

6

interpret it the way the respondents claim?

7

MR. ESTRADA:

Because I think as an empirical

8

matter it will be the case in most of the cases that

9

Congress may have contemplated that the sentences imposed

10

later will correspond to later-occurring crimes, and it's

11

not necessary to think that they crafted the entire

12

sentencing structure of the Federal courts to fit the

13

facts of a dual successive prosecution.

14

But even apart from that, I think that the

15

implicit assumption in the premise is that a statute that

16

requires a consecutive sentence purports to speak to what

17

may happen in the future. and I think that is not

18

empirically founded.

15

MR . BUSTAMANTE :

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court should affirm the Tenth Circuit,

16

because the Government ignores proper methods of statutory

17

construction in this case, and they base their entire

18

argument in this case on the false premise that the any

19

used in 924(c) (1) is capable of only one meaning.

20

That term actually has multiple definitional

21

possibilities, and where there are multiple definitional

22

possibilities, this Court -- any practitioner should

23

examine the entire text of the statute and place the word

in context with this entire statutory scheme.

here, or do you think its interpretation is absolutely

defensible just as the statute is written?

MR. BUSTAMANTE:

Your Honor, I believe

Mr.

Chief Justice, I believe that if the Court examines

10

924(c) (1) and the language of 924(c) (1) and then looks at

11

the history of 924(c) (1), I think it becomes clear that

12

924(c) (1) only applies to Federal sentences.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Bustamante, what is your response

to Mr. Estrada's point about 3584(a)?

15

understand that your only concern is your client, but if

we agree with you in this case with regard to defendants

17

in general we would be doing them more harm than good,

18

because if this provision doesn't apply to State

19

sentences, I don't see how you can distinguish 3584(a),

20

which also would not apply to State sentences, which would

mean that a Federal court could not make a Federal

Oh, you just lost me.

Do you have

anything about the text that would distinguish the two?
MR. BUSTAMANTE:

Not about the text, Your Honor,

5

but I believe that if the Court -- I think it's clear from

6

3584 that a court has discretion under that statute to run

7

sentences concurrently or consecutively, and I think the

8

difference between 3584, othe r than the legislative

9

history, Your Honor, is that 924(c) (1) does something very

10

different, which is, it takes absolute discretion away

11

from a court, which is a major change, Your Honor, in the

12

history of sentencing.

Throughout history, Federal courts, State courts

14

have been given great discretion in running -- deciding

15

whether sentences shall run concurrently or consecutively.

But the Government would not take

that discretion away from State courts.

significant matter.

have unusual facts, because it was a consecutive

QUESTION:

However, I don't think that criminal culpability

Well, another way to eliminate all

5

the chance, and the Government generously has not asserted

6

this, but it would be quite possible to interpret this to

speak only of the Federal courts, but to allow the

8

Federal -- to require the Federal sentences to be made

9

consecutive whenever a State court says that the State

10
11

sentence shall run concurrently,
And I guess you could have games being played

12

back and forth, and the State court revises its sentence

13

and the Federal court revises its sentence, but you could

14

eliminate all of that inconsistency by simply saying if a

15

State court after the Federal sentence imposes a

16

concurrent State sentence, the Federal sentence, pursuant

17

to the precise language of this, the term of imprisonment

imposed shall not run concurrently with that State

In the case of a Federal prosecution that

clearly the State sovereign should have the authority if

it seems proper to run their sentence concurrent to the

QUESTION:

But it doesn't preempt State law,

because you just, I think , recognized that you could go

back to State court and say, based on something that

Government reads this statute, the ball ends up in your

favor concurrency, so reduce the sentence.

15

MR . BUSTAMANTE:

You

I believe Justice Scalia's

16

premise was that if the statute was read at the Federal

17

court, that no sentence would run concurrent to the

18

Federal sentence if it occurred first, and I think that

19

would be a preemption, because the State court would not

20

be allowed to run their sentence --

QUESTION :

But that's not the position that

Mr. Estrada says that the Government -- that's not how the

MR. BUSTAMANTE:

Your Honor, we've come to this

Court for the remedy we're seeking because it's the

3

Government's goal in this case to ensure that -- one of

several things.

5

consecutive to the State sentence, but also r believe,

6

Your Honor, they seek to also violate 3584(a), Your Honor,

7

which states that a sentence, when someone goes in and

8

starts serving a Federal sentence , that sentence shall be

9

considered one aggregate sentence.

10

To ensure that the 924(c) gun count runs

Your Honor, what could occur in this case and in

11

cases in the future is that -- in this case, Your Honor,

12

the sentencing judge did run the underlying offense

13

concurrent to the State sentence.

14

What could occur in this case and other cases,

15

Your Honor, is that you would in fact have the Federal

16

sentence beginning, then the sentence would stop while the

17

State sentence would continue, and then at some point,

18

indeterminate point in the future the Federal 924(c) (1)

6

MR. BUSTAMANTE:

Thank you.
I believe the last sentence to

7

that statute states that when a prisoner begins to serve a

8

Federal sentence it shall be considered one aggregate

9

sentence, and what could result in this case and future

10

cases is that there would be a gap, a Federal gap in

11

sentences, and I do not believe that is what Congress

12

intended in 3584 or 924(c) (1), especially when you

13

consider the committee report of 924(c) (1), which states,

14

members of the Court, that in their opinion they are -- it

15

is their intent that the 924 (c) (1) gun count begin first,

16

and I think if the Court looks at that, that's the only

17

practical way to apply 924(c) (1).

18

924(c) (1) clearly was enacted to take all
discretion away from a court.

20

convicted of a 924(c) (1) sentence must do prison time.

21

That does not affect the court's discretion at all as to

22

the underlying offense, so it's really impractical

you can construe those sections consistently, can you not?

this sentence shall run concurrent, then the court may

consider doing that, and either do an upward or downward

In this case, Your Honor, the problem is, is

MR. BUSTAMANTE:

Your Honor, I believe in that

would be consistent with that, and the guideline would say

that if you commit an offense while -- a pending offense

with the statute, and I think in that instance the

2

guideline and the statute would probably be synonymous.

3

QUESTION:

Could you go back, please, to the

4

Chief Justice's question, because I didn't understand

5

either what the inconsistency is supposed to be if we

6

assume that both statutes apply to the State.

7

I mean, assume that 9

that -- I thought the

8

question was, if 3584(a) applies both to State and Federal

9

sentences, which I agree with you, I think it does, and

10

then if the section before us also applies to both State

ll

and Federal, as the Government but not you argues, I

12

thought you were saying that that would produce an

13

inconsistency, but I didn't understand the inconsistency

14

so I thought I'd ask you so you could explain.

15

MR. BUSTAMANTE:

I believe what I'm saying,

16

what -- I hope what I'm saying is that 3584 clearly from

17

its legislative history can allow the court under a

18

guideline analysis to run a sentence either consecutive or

19

concurrent to a State sentence.

20

Federal sentence.

may be right that there is an incompatibility between

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia, I believe that

the way the two statutes are distinguished is that

underlying Federal sentence for which the gun enhancement

is imposed.

I don't any more, because if you look at the

it's clear that statute was amended only to correct what

they felt were improper decisions by the Court in Busic

Your Honor, section 1 of 924(c) (1) deals with

they're referring to is that they do not want the court to

Your Honor, I think other sections of the

affect State law under the Government's argument.

15

I suppose there are many situations where there's a

mandate that any State sentence for a State offense based

applies -- 924(c) applies to sentences imposed by Federal

MR. BUSTAMANTE:

order it should go in, Your Honor, and how it affects the

They are stating that the Federal Government does not

However, I think, Your Honor, that in the

that's the only practical way to apply 924(c) (1), and the

924(c) (1) sentence, those sentences must both be mandated

to that defendant.

QUESTION:

So in this circumstance we'd simply

8

have to say, look, that committee report doesn't govern

9

this circumstance, that the judge is perfectly free to let

10

the rest of the sentence run concurrently with the State,

11

but he isn't free to let this part run with the State

12

because this part says it's supposed to run consecutively

13

with any preceding sentence.
MR. BUSTAMANTE:

14

Would that work?

That's true, Your Honor, if the

15

court -- but if 924(c) (1) is to be applied practically,

16

then I think that what would happen, you'd have to have a

17

prison time for 924(c) (1), and then for the remaining

18

underlying offense the court still would have discretion

19

to grant a downward departure to probation.

impossible
QUESTION:

21

It would be

Well, just run it -- if he doesn't

22

want to, say run the 920 -- run the substantive Federal

23

crime other than the 924(c) consecutively with the State

24

crime.

this 5 years.

Do that, and then when they're finished that, run

That would seem to solve the problem that

MR. BUSTAMANTE:

Your Honor, I think the flaw

4

is , Your Honor, is that c l early 924(c) (1) does require a

prison sentence.

6

not require a prison sentence.

at least impractical for a court to grant someone

supervised release and they serve that sentence and then 4

Any other underlying offense may or may

QUESTION:

It would be impossible, or

The supervised release would have to

take -- they'd have to split the supervised release from

the first part, that's true.
MR. BUSTAMANTE:

That's correct.

That's

correct.
QUESTION:

16

But I guess you could do that.

17

couldn't you -- would that require a departure?

sure.
MR. BUSTAMANTE :

Why

I'm not

I think it would require some

kind of downward departu re for the underlying offense,

Your Honor, but I can't imagine a court giving someone

supervised release, they serve a supervised release for 4
