CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Singletary.
Mr. Lawry.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW C. LAWRY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. LAWRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Everybody agrees that the proceedings by which

11
12

petitioner was sentenced to death violated the Eighth

13

Amendment of the Constitution.

14

holds.

15

Espinosa v. Florida so

The issue before the Court is whether the

16

settled principles of Eighth Amendment law applied to the

17

Florida system in 1992 in Espinosa were themselves

18

compelled by existing precedent in 1986.

19

QUESTION:

That the --

Another way of appraising it is the

20

way we phrased it in the Butler case, isn't it, Mr. Lawry,

21

that could a reasonable jurist have decided otherwise?

22

23
24
25

MR. LAWRY:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, that is

another way of phrasing it.
That the Espinosa result was compelled in 1986
can be explained very briefly, in 30 seconds or less.

As

1

Stringer explains, as of 1985 an unadorned jury-

2

instruction on heinous, atrocious or cruel aggravating

3

factor was unconstitutional.

4

of such a factor required resentencing.

An uncorrected jury weighing

5

Moreover, jury weighing of such a factor could

6

be corrected or cured only by harmless error analysis or

7

by independent reweighing by a court that was untainted by

8

the original error.

9

principles to the Florida sentencing scheme.

10

Espinosa simply applied those settled

To elaborate somewhat on these points, I would

11

like to describe in a bit more detail why the result in

12

Espinosa was compelled by this Court's decisions in

13

Proffitt, Godfrey, and Stringer.

14

QUESTION:

You -- I don't want to interrupt the

15

sequence that you want to follow, but are you going to

16

address also Baldwin in Alabama, because Baldwin held in

17

'85, I think --

18

QUESTION:

Five, yes.

19

QUESTION:

-- that there was a question about

20

just how intense the reweighing had to be if that were to

21

supersede a jury error, and I would have supposed that

22

that would be factored into the question of just how

23

clearly anticipatable Espinosa was.

24
25

MR. LAWRY:

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir, I think it does

factor in, if I can explain the way that I think it

1

factors in.

We have to start with Proffitt v. Florida in

2

1976, and in fact respondent has quoted one of the key-

3

passages from Proffitt in their brief at page 13.

4

The Court was discussing whether the Florida

5

sentencing scheme was basically constitutional, and it

6

said that it was basically constitutional as long as

7

adequate guidance was provided, and I'm quoting here, to

8

those charged with the duty of recommending -- that is,

9

the jury -- or imposing death sentences.

10

So in Proffitt this Court recognized that the

11

jury has sentencing authority and must be adequately

12

guided, and I would see Baldwin as more or less a reminder

13

that the Florida sentencing scheme does work in that way.

14

It's different from Alabama, which at the time gave no

15

real consideration to what the jury did.

16

QUESTION:

Well, that may -- you know, that

17

might be the better view, but isn't it also the case that

18

one could reasonably read Baldwin as saying that it's not

19

clear whether the subsequent act of the sentencing judge

20

in the Florida scheme constituted an adequate reweighing

21

even on the assumption -- which, of course, we never

22

really know under the Florida scheme -- even on the

23

assumption that that factor was found by the jury and was

24

one of the bases for the jury's recommendation.

25

Couldn't it reasonably have been argued that

1

Baldwin had left that question open?
MR. LAWRY:

2

Well, yes, I don't think that

3

Baldwin -- Baldwin itself decided that decision.

4

that's --

5

QUESTION:

I think

But didn't Baldwin signal that there

6

was a real issue to this effect, and that issue, at least

7

so far as the particular Florida scheme was concerned, did

8

not get resolved until -- or at least resolved in part

9

until Espinosa came along?

10

MR. LAWRY:

No, I -- well, I think that Baldwin

11

itself does not decide the issue.

I think that's correct.

12

I think that the way to decide -- because Baldwin was not

13

looking at the Florida scheme.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LAWRY:

Right.
The way to decide the issue is to

16

look at how the Florida sentencing scheme actually works,

17

applying this Court's settled principles, and if you look

18

at the way that the Florida sentencing scheme works, you

19

have to start with the Florida supreme court's 1975

20

decision in Tedder, and respondent virtually ignores

21

Tedder in their brief because that's the only way that you

22

can really seriously argue that the Florida jury does not

23

have any sentencing authority.

24
25

Proffitt says that the jury does have sentencing
authority, that it has to be guided, and that's exactly

1

2

what this Court picked up on in Espinosa.
QUESTION:

But the question, it seems to me,

3

that you've got to wrestle with here under Teague is

4

whether, assuming we were correct, and I happen to think

5

we were insofar as evaluating the significance of the

6

jury's function, you still have to wrestle with the

7

question whether the subsequent act of the judge, who is

8

presumed to know the Proffitt standard, in effect

9

adequately supersedes what the jury had done, and I would

10
11

have thought that that was the difficult question.
And one reason why that was a question upon

12

which people could reasonably disagree was that Baldwin

13

had said we're not telling you yet just what kind of

14

subsequent act or how intense or de novo a subsequent

15

reweighing will be required, and I would have thought that

16

was the sticking point under Teague.

17

MR. LAWRY:

Well, I think that Stringer answers

18

the question about what significance the trial court's

19

actions have.

20

cure weighing error before a jury, it's necessary to

21

either have harmless error review or independent

22

reweighing.

23
24
25

Stringer says that as of 1985, in order to

QUESTION:

But in Mississippi it was the jury

that sentenced, wasn't it?
MR. LAWRY:

It was the jury that sentenced, yes,

1

and because the Florida jury has sentencing authority, the

2

same result applies in Florida.
QUESTION:

3

Yes, but the sentencing authority is

4

divided in Florida, is it not, between the jury and the

5

judge.

6

MR. LAWRY:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LAWRY:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.
In Mississippi it wasn't.
That's true, yes.
I'm not sure how you read -- you read

10

Proffitt to say that the jury is the sentencer as well?

11

Is that my interpretation of your argument thus far?
MR. LAWRY:

12

Yes, I do read it in that fashion.

13

In fact, it refers to sentencing authorities in the

14

plural, and two or three times it talks about adequate

15

guidance, adequate direction --

16

QUESTION:

Well, but three or four times it says

17

the trial judge is the sentencing authority, and so forth.

18

I guess we can quarrel over the reading of it.

19

certainly don't think it's clearly to the effect that you

20

state.

21

MR. LAWRY:

I

I think that it's clear from

22

Proffitt that the sentencing authority is divided.

23

Certainly the judge ultimately imposes the sentence.

24
25

QUESTION:

It says the basic difference between

the Florida system and the Georgia system is that in

1

Florida the sentence is determined by the trial judge

2

rather than by the jury, and there are like phrases --

3

there are like phrases throughout the opinion.

4

MR. LAWRY:

5

QUESTION:

6

That's correct, but -Counsel, Espinosa was a per curiam

decision?

7

MR. LAWRY:

8

QUESTION:

That's correct, yes.
Which lends, I suppose, a little

9

support to your theory that this Court didn't think there

10

was some wide division on the issue, or it might not have

11

handled it as a per curiam.
MR. LAWRY:

12

I think that's correct, and

13

certainly nothing had changed in the law in the

14

intervening period, and I think it was obvious to this

15

Court in Espinosa that the Florida sentencing scheme in

16

fact gives sentencing authority to the jury.

17
18

QUESTION:

Well, we had heard that point in

Soklar.

19

MR. LAWRY:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct, yes.
And I suppose one explanation for the

21

per curiam is that the Court had heard the arguments on it

22

in Soklar.

23

MR. LAWRY:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.
Does Florida law require the

sentencing judge to place great weight on the

1

recommendation of the jury?
MR. LAWRY:

2

Exactly.

That's what Florida law

3

requires, and that's whether the jury's recommendation is

4

life or death.
QUESTION:

5

But Mr. Lawry, you also said that

6

harmless error plays a part in this, and this trial judge

7

did say that the facts speak for themselves.

8

indicate that he reweighed without reference to the jury

9

verdict?

10

Doesn't that

Isn't that a signal that what we're talking

about is really academic?
MR. LAWRY:

11

Well, no, Your Honor, I don't think

12

so.

13

what the trial judge found when he said the facts speak

14

for themselves, but even if it's assumed that the trial

15

judge was finding that the facts fit within the Dixon

16

limiting construction in Florida, which I don't think can

17

be assumed, but even if we were to assume that, merely a

18

finding by the judge that the facts -- that he believes

19

the facts fit within the aggravating circumstance doesn't

20

mean that the jury necessarily would have.

21

I -- first it's very difficult to determine exactly

It's certainly not a finding of harmless error,

22

because he doesn't recognize that there was any error, and

23

it's also not any kind of independent reweighing, which is

24

what Stringer would require, because the judge in his

25

weighing process must give great weight to what the jury

1

did, and what the jury did was tainted by the invalid

2

instruction, so it's not possible for the trial court in

3

Florida to cure the error because the trial court has to

4

weigh the error.

You can't cure the error by weighing it.

QUESTION:

5

But if he said -- this trial judge

6

had said, now, I know what heinous, atrocious conduct is,

7

and I find that that standard is met here, these facts

8

speak for themselves, would that be -- is that -- would

9

that be adequate then to amount to harmless error?
MR. LAWRY:

10

No, Your Honor, not without

11

determining the effect of the error upon the jury, because

12

the jury may not view the facts in the same light.

13

may not believe that the facts are unnecessarily tortuous.

14

They

Unless you go to that step and say that the

15

facts are

16

some standard would have found that -- the case

17

unnecessarily tortuous, then you're not applying harmless

18

error analysis, and --

19

-- that the jury necessarily would have, or by

QUESTION:

Would it be harmless only if the

20

judge disassociated himself from what the jury did and

21

said, I'm looking at this de novo and here's how I come

22

out?

23

MR. LAWRY:

Yes, that's right, and furthermore,

24

in the Florida system the Florida supreme court's review,

25

both what the trial court does is virtually controlled by
11

1

the jury's recommendation.

2

court's review, because if a death sentence is imposed

3

after a jury recommendation of death, the Florida supreme

4

court does a normal form of deferential appellate review

5

to see if the trial court's findings are supported by the

6

evidence.

7

So is the Florida supreme

If a death sentence is imposed after a jury

8

recommendation of life, the Florida supreme court will

9

affirm only if virtually no reasonable person could differ

10

as to the appropriateness of the sentence.

11

So that many, many times the Florida supreme

12

court reverses the trial court's imposition of a death

13

sentence after a jury recommendation of life when the

14

trial court did not make any error.

15

not err in any of its findings, but the Florida supreme

16

court nevertheless reverses and imposes life because of

17

the jury's life recommendation.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Lawry, there's also an issue of

19

procedural bar in this case.

20

that at all?

21

The trial court did

Are you going to address

I mean, as I understand it the Florida supreme

22

court held in this litigation specifically that Lambrix

23

did not raise the issue of the trial court's failure to

24

include his special instruction on his direct appeal, and

25

consequently Lambrix's Espinosa claim is procedurally

barred.

That's the last word of the Florida supreme court

2

on that subject.

Why is that not dispositive?

MR. LAWRY:

3

Well, it's not dispositive for

4

several reasons.

5

conviction proceedings there was what the district court

6

found was a merits ruling on this claim, and so this was a

7

second review after remand from the Eleventh Circuit.
Now, whether that was -- whether what the

8

9

First, in the initial round of post

Florida supreme court did on its second look, whether that

10

was an adequate and independent State bar, is a very

11

complicated issue that's tied up with Florida rules and

12

practice, and it's not been ruled on by any court, and so

13

it's

14
15
16

QUESTION:

T thought it was ruled on by the

Florida supreme court.
MR. LAWRY:

No -- yes, Your Honor.

I mean, it

17

hasn't -- whether that was an adequate and independent

18

State bar has not been ruled on by any Federal court is

19

what I should have said.

20

QUESTION:

Well, I find it hard to get around

21

the statement by the supreme court of the State that the

22

objection wasn't raised on appeal, and there is a

23

procedural bar.

24

a later lower court opinion in the State which contradicts

25

the supreme court statement that there was a procedural

MR. LAWRY:

2

No.

There was -- the claim was

3

previously raised in the 3850 proceedings, and in those

proceedings there was what the district court found

5

amounted to a merits ruling, but --

QUESTION:

By a lower Florida court.

7

QUESTION:

The supreme court of Florida's ruling

came after that, did it not?
MR. LAWRY:

It came -- yes.

It came after the

10

case had gone to Federal habeas proceedings, proceeded to

11

the Eleventh Circuit.

12

because it wanted the State's views on the merits of the

13

Espinosa claim.
QUESTION:

MR. LAWRY:

That's correct, but if the lower

court has ruled on the merits and the appellate court does

not disturb that, then under Ylst this Court will look

QUESTION:

2

Well, but the procedural bar arises

3

from the original trial.

4

as a result of what was done at the original trial, the

5

mere fact that you have different later proceedings

certainly wouldn't alter the judgment of whether there's a

procedural bar or not.
MR. LAWRY:

8

9

No.

If that is procedurally barred

The procedural bar goes away,

though, if the State courts rule on the merits.
What I'm trying to get at is that it's a very

complex issue, the procedural bar here.

The Eleventh Circuit ruled only on Teague.

Is there a particular point in there

that concerns -QUESTION:

4

No.

I thought that their basic point

5

was that as you go back to that period of time, the late

6

eighties and so forth, it wasn't really clear the extent

7

to which the Constitution required States to follow what

8

one would have thought of as ordinary legal harmless error

9

rules, and that perhaps all that was happening was that

10

the judge was being told, you go look at this case where

11

there's a HAC error, and you make up your own mind.
We have to have a judge saying that this case is

12

13

the kind of case that isn't cruel and unusual, heinous,

14

aggravated or cruel on the ground that all murders are

15

like that.

16

But as long as the judge has gone and looked at the facts

17

and said there's something special about it, that's good

18

enough.

19

There has to be something special about it.

MR. LAWRY:

Well, Your Honor, that contention is

20

completely antithetical to Stringer v. Black.

21

was a case that the Mississippi supreme court said would

meet -- was -- would fall within the definition of

that the thrust of the amicus brief is that Stringer is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROL M. DITTMAR

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. DITTMAR:

5
6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are two fundamental reasons why this Court

7
8

should affirm the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit in this

9

case.

The first issue is the Eleventh Circuit's

10

conclusion that Teague v. Lane bars Espinosa review in a

11

Federal habeas proceeding, and that conclusion is correct.
The second reason is the procedural bar that

12

13

exists, and I'd like to start by addressing the procedural

14

bar. ■-

15

First --

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Which the Eleventh Circuit didn't

address, is that right?
MS. DITTMAR:

That's correct.

The Eleventh

19

Circuit obeyed the command of treating retroactivity as a

20

threshold issue and decided the case solely on Teague, so

21

they did not address the State's procedural bar argument.

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. DITTMAR:

24
25

You raised it there, though?
Yes, sir.

It was raised there

numerous times, including, even on a motion for rehearing.

MS. DITTMAR:

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. DITTMAR:

Yes, it was.

And it was ruled on there?
Yes, it was.

The district

court -- as to the Godfrey claim that had been raised back

6

in the district court, the State argued at that time that

7

there was a procedural bar based on several different

8

reasons.

9

appendix on pages 46 to 49 in the State's response, the

One of the reasons, and this is in the joint

10

primary reason was this was a direct appeal issue in the

11

State of Florida, and it had not been raised in Mr.

12

Lambrix's direct appeal.

13

The next -- the other argument put forth by the

14

State at that time was that although it had been raised in

15

the motion for post conviction relief, the trial judge in

16

that motion did not decide the merits of that issue, and

17

furthermore, when it went to the Florida supreme court,

18

the Florida supreme court did not have that particular

19

issue before it, because the Florida supreme court opinion

20

from the appeal of the post conviction motion clearly says

21

there are two issues before this Court.

22

relate to the defendant's state of intoxication at the

time of the crime.

MS. DITTMAR:

2

QUESTION:

What the district court found?

-- what the petitioner's counsel has

told us that it was specifically included in the grounds

4

that were presented in the collateral -- in the appeal

5

from the denial of collateral relief?

6

7
8

9

MS. DITTMAR:

Based on Florida procedure is how

the district court reached that conclusion.
What happened is, the Godfrey claim that was
raised in post conviction -- and this was a claim that the

10

Florida supreme court had inconsistently interpreted this

11

aggravating factor, and therefore the factor was invalid.

12

That claim was raised in the post conviction motion for

13

the first time, and the State responded at that time that

14

it was a direct appeal issue.

15

The circuit court judge, the trial judge in

16

Florida, did not specifically address that issue.

17

order he merely concluded that Mr. Lambrix was not

18

entitled to relief.

19

or based on the procedural law in Florida.

20

his conclusion is Mr. Lambrix is not entitled to relief.

21

That is what the Federal district judge in the habeas

22

proceeding found to be a ruling on the merits, his

23

conclusion.

24
25

In his

He does not say, based on the merits,
He just says

When that was appealed to the Florida supreme
court, there is a particular statute -- I'm sorry, a rule

1

of procedure in Florida that when a post conviction motion

2

is determined summarily by a trial judge without an

3

evidentiary hearing, that what is -- goes to the Florida

4

supreme court or whatever the appellate court is, is

5

simply the record that was before the lower court, and

6

that there is no briefing or argument in that appeal.

7

It's basically a review of what the trial judge had before

8

him.

9

If there is an evidentiary hearing held on the

10

post conviction motion, it is treated as an ordinary

11

appeal where the parties file briefs and orally argue the

12

case, and then the court decides it.

13

Because there had been no evidentiary hearing on

14

the post conviction motion, the petitioner has argued to

15

the Federal district court successfully that under the

16

Florida rule that says everything goes up to the Florida

17

supreme court, even though in this particular case there

18

were briefs filed and there was oral argument held, that

19

under the rule, you have to look at the entire record and

20

not just what was argued in the briefs and argued to the

21

court, and that's what the district court found when he

22

found that there was a ruling on the merits by the trial

23

judge, and that that ruling on the merits was undisturbed

24

by the Florida supreme court.

25

Therefore, he found that it was reviewed, and

Central to his holding -- of course, this is prior to the

2

time that the Espinosa claim went back and was found to be

3

procedurally barred by the Florida supreme court.

4

to the district court was the idea that no State court had

5

ever specifically said this is procedurally barred.

was looking for that language in one of the State court

7

opinions and he did not find it.

that statement, he said that there was a ruling on the

merits.

Based on the lack of

So the State has maintained consistently that

11

this was a direct appeal issue that should have been

raised in the direct appeal and it wasn't.

He

This same issue in the Sochar case, this Court

14

declined to address it, because it was procedurally barred

15

in that case, and that was a direct review case, so you

16

really can't come back on a collateral case on habeas

18

the same issue that you didn't address earlier.

19

QUESTION:

But we would have to decide this

20

issue of Florida law here to conclude there is a

21

procedural bar, is that right?

straightforward issue, though.

MS. DITTMAR:

Right, but the -- we have the

clear statement from the Florida supreme court applying

the bar, and we don't have any State court decision ever

merits of it, or even recognizing or acknowledging that

QUESTION:

3

It's something that needs to be

Do you know how many Florida

4

convictions or sentences would have to be set aside if we

5

were to agree with the petitioner on the merits?
MS. DITTMAR:

6

Yes, ma'am.

I would say less than

7

a dozen cases, not necessarily set aside but at least

8

considered in the habeas proceeding.
Most of the cases in Florida where this has come

9
10

up have either been decided since the time of Espinosa,

11

and obviously at that point the Florida supreme court was

12

well aware of the issue and they had consistently applied

13

Espinosa to the cases that have come before them.

14

It really only affects the cases prior to

15

Espinosa that had already gone into Federal court, and

16

there would have to be the preservation of error and, in

17

fact, the Florida supreme court, if it was raised in the

18

trial court, an issue, and argued on appeal, the Florida

19

supreme court is granting collateral relief in those

20

cases.

21

So if it has not been procedurally barred, even

22

though the conviction may be final in Florida, they can

23

still get relief from the Florida supreme court without

24

having to turn to the Federal court.

fundamentally the procedural bar is an issue that needs to

be addressed as a threshold issue by any Federal court.

QUESTION:

I think that

But it would be extraordinary for

5

this Court to take it up in the first instance, when it

6

hasn't been taken up in the lower Federal courts.

7

MS. DITTMAR:

Well, I don't think it would be

8

that extraordinary.

In Gray v. Netherland this Court

9

found a procedural bar on the Brady claim, despite the

10

fact that the circuit court in Gray had never reached the

11

procedural argument on that claim.

12

The district court in Gray had found a

13

procedural bar on the Brady claim.

14

not address it at all, and when Gray came up to this

15

Court, this Court addressed the procedural bar that

16

applied on that claim, so I don't think it's so unique

17

that it can't be done, and I certainly don't think it's

18

something that's beyond this Court's ability to do.

QUESTION:

The circuit court did

prosecutor from that?

It's -- I mean, suppose we said

you're right on the procedural bar.

I mean, so how do you benefit from that, except

you might have two arguments instead of one or something.

MS. DITTMAR:

Well, I think this Court can

address both issues in this case.

limited to only addressing one issue.

Court reason to look at the Teague issue and to decide the

I don't think you're
The Eleventh

I think that you can say that'there are two

13

reasons to affirm the Eleventh Circuit, and one of them is

14

a procedural bar, and one of them is the Teague issue.

QUESTION:

On the Teague issue, it -- if -- is

16

the reading of Proffitt dispositive of the case?

17

disagree with petitioner's counsel and say Proffitt was

18

very, very clear that the judge is the sentencer, is that

19

the end of the case?

20

MS. DITTMAR:

If we

I think that is -- a great deal of

21

the case is Proffitt, but also the other sentencing

22

opinions out of Florida that has come from this Court,

23

including Spaziano, where you were looking at the

24

constitutionality of the judge imposing a death sentence

25

when the judge had recommended a life sentence.

And in Spaziano you talk about how that jury

recommendation is only advisory, and again you refer to

3

Florida as a judge-sentencing State, and even up through

4

the time of the Walton decision in Arizona, which was

Court continuously refers to Florida as a judge-sentencing

State.

Sometimes you put things in neat categories,

It is an important part of the

QUESTION:

presumptively on what the judge does?
MS. DITTMAR:

I think necessarily a life

21

recommendation will have a graver impact on what the judge

22

does than a death recommendation.

QUESTION:

In

Therefore we should assume that if

3

the jury had come in with a life recommendation here, if

it -- presumably a properly instructed jury might have

And in fact the judge, as a matter of

Florida law, would have had a duty to pay attention to

MS. DITTMAR:

Right.

Well, as a matter of

15

Florida law the judge still has to make his own

QUESTION:

Right, I understand, but he doesn't

18

do it as though there were no jury recommendation out

19

there.

20

MS. DITTMAR:

That's correct.

He has to take

21

into account the jury recommendation, and I think

22

particularly when the jury is recommending something that

23

differs from his independent analysis of the situation, he

24

has to consider it.

QUESTION:

answers, well, it was obvious.

14

how obvious is this?

I mean, the question is,

15

So in thinking about that, well, basically there

16

is something working out here which is obvious from, like,

17

Justinian or something, that if you have a jury and the

18

jury decides whether a person's negligent or any other

19

thing, and the jury's misinstructed, you get a new trial,

20

unless the judge says that it was harmless, and it seems

21

as if all these cases represent a working out of that

principle and nothing else.

12

QUESTION:

What is your response to my

oversimplified effort to make it clear?
MS. DITTMAR:

What is clear is that there is

13

Eighth Amendment error if the jury waives an invalid

14

factor, and under the cases prior to Espinosa, the

15

validity of the factor turned on its application to the

16

facts of a particular case and the way the factor had been

17

interpreted by the State appellate court to give a

18

narrowing definition of the factor.

1

In Espinosa, the validity of the factor all of a

20

sudden turned on the sufficiency of the jury

recommendation, or the jury instruction, rather than how

the factor was applied and whether it had been narrowed

1

Then this Court should not have

disposed of it summarily in a three-page per curiam

not to dispose of a case in that kind of summary way if

here that we have full briefing and argument if we're

MS. DITTMAR:

9

Isn't it the general practice

Well, I think, as the point was

made earlier, there had been briefing on the issue in

10

Sochar that the Court examined, but I don't think it's a

fair conclusion to draw merely from a summary -- the fact

that it was a summary opinion in Espinosa to say we would

QUESTION:

What Godfrey said was, the Georgia supreme

decision in Cabana v. Bullock, when you said a case which

2

you had to determine at what point there had to be a

finding of Enmund under a felony murder situation for the

QUESTION:

6

No, but your -- it seems to me that

your argument and your response to Justice Stevens is to

say that if there is sufficiency of the evidence to

harmless error is not sufficiency of evidence.

correct?

MS. DITTMAR:

We have said very clearly that
Isn't that

Well, that's true, but I think you

have to look at, and especially in a habeas case, the

QUESTION:

But you don't stop there, right?

2

MS. DITTMAR:

3

QUESTION:

You don't stop there.

I want to go back for a second to my

4

question, because looking at it as I was doing you'd say,

5

look, all that Godfrey is, is it tells you what the basic

6

error is.

7

negligence.
And all Clemons is, it tells you, treat it like

8

9

It's like making a misinstruction about

a negligence case.

It gives you some rules, which are

10

obvious rules, that if the jury makes a mistake because it

11

was misinstructed on the Godfrey issue, like negligence or

12

anything, then of course you have to have a new trial,

13

unless the judge can say for one of three reasons that it

14

made no difference.

15

And all that Espinosa does is say, Florida,

16

which is a little bit special, is really like a State

17

where the jury decides it.

18

And in case you had any doubt, Stringer makes

19

clear this very basic rule, the rule from Justinian, is

20

the rule.

It was obvious, says Stringer.
Now, that's a way.

21

I know it's not the perfect

22

way, and I know it's overlooking a lot of things, but if I

23

were to look at the case that way, then I would say, yeah,

24

Espinosa's pretty obvious, and this whole thing's obvious

25

enough.

1

So I want to get a direct response to that.

2

MS. DITTMAR:

The biggest leap in that analysis

3

is when you say, Florida is like a jury sentencing

4

situation.
QUESTION:

5

Ah, that's the biggest leap.

Okay.

6

It's at that point that then you look to Espinosa's quote

7

of Tedder.

8

MS. DITTMAR:

9

QUESTION:

Right.

Then the question is, do you really

10

have to give great weight to the jury, and if we read

11

Tedder and went back and read the earlier Florida cases

12

and thought, gee, it looks as if the judge really is

13

giving weight to the jury and has to, then we would think

14

this is pretty much like a negligence case, and everybody

15

in Florida should have thought that it was.

16

MS. DITTMAR:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Except that --

And then what would we look at to see

the contrary?
MS. DITTMAR:

Except that when you read Tedder,

20

I don't think you're limited to Tedder itself.

I think

21

you need to read the Florida supreme court decisions that

22

interpret Tedder and that say what they meant by Tedder,

23

and the Florida supreme court has expressly come out and

24

said in Tedder we did not elevate the jury to be a

25

cosentencer in Florida.

That was never our intent.

The judge has a statutory duty to do an

2

independent, de novo review of the aggravating and the

3

mitigating factors, and the jury recommendation is just

4

that, an advisory recommendation, and the Florida supreme

court said that quite strongly in cases where the Eleventh

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW C. LAWRY

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. LAWRY:

I'd like to briefly address the

17

procedural bar issue.

There's two important points about

18

what happened in the trial court in the 3850 proceedings.

19

The claim that was raised there was a Maynard claim that

20

challenged the vagueness of the jury instructions as well

21

as the Florida supreme court's review.

22

Furthermore, the trial court denied the State's

23

motion to dismiss, which was based on procedural grounds,

24

so the clear implication of what the trial court did is

25

that it was ruling on the merits of the claim.

If there's no further questions, I have nothing

1
2

additional.
QUESTION:

3

Well, but the procedural bar is not

4

just failure to raise it at the trial level, is it?

5

failure to bring it to the attention of the supreme court,

6

which brings us back to our earlier discussion.

7

MR. LAWRY:

It's

Right, but when a State court rules

8

on the merits -- the 3850 proceedings are after the trial.

9

When a State court rules on the merits in any proceeding,

10

that does away with the procedural bar.

11

though the court perhaps could have applied a procedural

12

bar.

13

QUESTION:

They -- even

But that's a question of Florida law,

14

I take it, requires interpretation of what the Florida law

15

is in that regard.

16

MR. LAWRY:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Yes, that's right.
And the Eleventh Circuit is more

familiar with that than we.
MR. LAWRY:

That's correct, and that's why we

20

think the appropriate disposition is to remand after

21

ruling in our favor on the Teague issue.

22

QUESTION:

The part about Espinosa which

23

opposing counsel said was the least obvious was the part

24

about what Florida State law is really like.

25

the role of judge-jury there really like a judge-jury in a

That is, is

1

negligence case or some other, or does the judge really

2

make a pretty independent decision?

3
4
5

Now, what do you think we ought to read on that,
just Tedder?
MR. LAWRY:

Well, I would read Sochar and the

6

cases cited in Sochar, because there are numerous kinds of

7

jury error that the Florida supreme court has reviewed in

8

death penalty cases -- jury instruction error, improper

9

evidence, improper argument.

10

In none of those cases has the court said, oh,

11

well, the jury has -- there was error in front of the

12

jury, but the judge did it, okay, so we don't have to

13

concern ourselves with the jury.

14

look to see whether the error affected the jury, and

15

that's exactly what should be done in this case, and that

16

shows that it's not just a pure judge case --

They've always said,

17

QUESTION:

18

response to Justice O'Connor?
