ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises from respondent's attempt to

15

withdraw from his guilty plea.

16

agreement in which the Government agreed to drop certain

17

charges against him, respondent plead guilty -- pleaded

18

guilty to mail fraud and the receipt of stolen property in

19

four counts.

20

Pursuant to a plea

When -- at the Rule 11 plea proceeding, the

21

district court ascertained that respondent knew the nature

22

of the charges that were brought against him, that he knew

23

of the rights that he would be waiving by pleading guilty,

24

that he knew the maximum sentence that he could face, that

25

the court also ascertained that his guilty plea was

entirely voluntary and uncoerced, and the court

2

ascertained the facts of the crime as narrated both by

3

respondent and as narrated by the prosecutor, and then he

4

found out -- he ascertained that the respondent agreed

5

with the prosecutor's account.

6

The court stated at that point, after having

7

gone through that proceeding, that it would -- that it

8

accepted the guilty plea and that it would defer the

9

decision about whether to accept or reject the plea

10
11

agreement.
One month later, respondent attempted to

12

withdraw from his guilty plea.

13

court refused, finding that respondent had advanced no

14

fair and just reason for doing so.

15

The court, the district

The court of appeals reversed that decision,

16

holding that the respondent could withdraw from his guilty

17

plea at will for any reason or for no reason, as the court

18

stated, and reversed the district court.

19

Now, our position is that respondent could

20

withdraw from his guilty plea only if he had a fair and

21

just reason for doing so under Rule 32 (e) of the Federal

22

Rules of Criminal Procedure.

23

just reason in this case, the district court properly

24

declined to permit him to withdraw.

Because he had no fair and

plea at the free option of the defendant is inconsistent

2

with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

3

provides that before sentence a district court may permit

4

a defendant to withdraw from a guilty plea if he shows a

fair and just reason.

Rule 32(e)

6

Now, the courts -- courts that in -- the courts

7

that have to determine whether to accept a plea agreement

8

ordinarily will do just what the district court did here,

9

which is postpone a decision on the plea agreement until

10

at or near the time of sentencing, when they've had a

11

chance to review the presentence report.

12

accept the guilty plea at the time of the Rule 11 hearing.

13

Under the Ninth Circuit's rule in this case, the

Under the -- and

14

Rule 32 (e) standard, the fair and just reason standard,

15

would have virtually no application at all.

16

apply only for the minutes or hours or maybe days from the

17

time that the district court has reviewed the presentence

18

report and can make a decision about whether to accept or

19

reject the plea agreement and the time of sentencing,

20

which is really no time at all.

QUESTION:

It would

Mr. Feldman, there seems to be a

22

certain amount of interchangeability of these terms in

23

appellate opinions, acceptance of a plea, or acceptance of

24

a plea agreement.

25

In fact, until this case came along I don't

think I had ever focused on the fact that there might be a

2

difference in the two.

3

plea agreement, and vice versa.

4

these two are separated, the entry of a plea and a

5

subsequent plea agreement, if you will?

6

MR. FELDMAN:

We tend to think of a plea as a
How often is it that

I think -- Your Honor, I haven't

7

been able to get -- let me put it this way.

They are

8

always separate in cases -- virtually always separate in

9

cases where a district court has to make a decision on a

10

plea agreement, which is not in all guilty plea cases but

11

is in a great many of them.

12

4

QUESTION:

Well, and how often is it that the

district court has to separate the decision?
MR. FELDMAN:

As I said, I think it's in every

5

case in which the Government agrees to drop certain

6

charges in response for the defendant's -- in exchange for

7

the defendant's guilty plea, and when you have that kind

8

of a plea agreement, under the Sentencing Guideline --

9

under the Federal Rules of Procedure the district court is

20

permitted to defer a decision on whether to accept that

21

plea agreement, and under the guidelines it says that the

22

district court is required to do so.

23

In virtually all of those cases, and I'll tell

24

you in a minute why I say virtually -- in virtually all of

25

those cases the district court will do just what the

1

district court did here, which is accept the guilty plea

2

in accordance with the rules for accepting a guilty plea

3

in Rule 11, and defer a decision on a plea agreement.

4

The only reason I say virtually all and not all

5

is, there are two circumstances under which that won't

6

happen in those charge-bargaining types of cases.

7

circumstance is where the district court defers decision

8

on whether to accept the plea itself.

9

occurrence, but we cited a couple of cases in our brief

10

One

This is a very rare

where it happened.

11

The district court sees the -- listens to the

12

guilty plea, thinks there may be something wrong -- I'm

13

not sure -- it doesn't really explain why the district

14

court chose to do that, but there's nothing in the Federal

15

Rules of Procedure that requires a district court to

16

accept a guilty plea at the time it's tendered, and so if

17

the guilty -- if the court defers decision on whether to

18

accept it, then everything may happen at once, usually at

19

around the time of sentencing, both the acceptance of the

20

plea and of the plea agreement.

21

The other category of cases, which is also rare

22

but not quite as rare as those, is cases where for some

23

reason there was a preplea presentence report prepared.

24

In those case the district court already has the

25

presentence report at the time the plea is -- the plea

1

colloquy occurs under Rule 11 and therefore once again the

2

district court can take care of everything at once, and

3

there's no period of time during -- between the time of

4

accepting the plea and a decision on whether to accept or

5

reject the plea agreement.

6

But aside from those cases, this procedure that

7

happened here I think is exactly by the book.

8

exactly what's envisioned by the Rules of Procedure, and

9

it will happen in the majority of guilty plea cases.

10

QUESTION:

It's

And if at the end of the day the

11

judge decides not to accept the plea agreement by virtue

12

of what the judge reads in the presentence report, the

13

rules permit the defendant to withdraw from the plea.

14

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

The judge must at

15

that point, under Rule -- I think 11(e) (4), I believe.

16

The rule -- once the judge rejects the plea agreement, at

17

that point what -- the goal is to put the parties in the

18

same position they would have been in if nothing had

19

happened, if none of this had happened, because the

20

agreement can't be carried out.

21

the agreement is -- has now failed.

22

A condition subsequent to

23

you would do in ordinary contract cases when that kind of

situation occurs.

1

course, at that point is no longer bound to carry out any

2

commitments it has under the plea agreement, and -QUESTION:

3

Do we take this case on the

4

assumption that there was no fair and just reason for the

5

withdrawal within the meaning of the rule?
MR. FELDMAN:

6

That's right.

That's -- that was

7

what -- the court of appeals specifically held that the

8

defendant was permitted to withdraw for any reason or for

9

no reason.

The district court held that the reasons that

10

were advanced by the respondent were not fair and just

11

reasons, and that hasn't been challenged in this Court, so

12

I think that we definitely -- the case definitely comes

13

before the Court in that posture.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Feldman, there's one difference.

15

Your opponent argues -- I don't know how significant it

16

is -- that in the scenario you give, the difference is the

17

judge will have seen the presentence report before the

18

trial, which normally is not desirable.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

I mean, that actually will

20

happen also in any case in which he rejects the plea

21

agreement.

22

QUESTION:

That's right.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

I mean, that's contemplated by the

24

rules that that's going to happen.

25

there's likely to be some prejudice that might result from

How does it work with the Government?

That is -- I understand -- let's -- in the case of a (B)

conceptually.

What you're saying is that during those periods

2

So why shouldn't the Government be

5

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's really just based on

6

the contract analogy of plea-bargaining that the Court has

7

referred to a number of times and the rule in Santabello

8

that the Government does have to --

9

QUESTION:

Santabello wasn't a Federal case.

MR. FELDMAN:

10

That's correct, but generally the

11

Government does have to fulfill the undertakings that it

assumes in connection with a plea agreement.

MR. FELDMAN:

things work out a little bit differently.

possible position, and of course that's not raised by this

7

case and the Government rarely does attempt to withdraw

8

from plea agreements, but --

9

QUESTION:

That's a

But all I'm suggesting is if it's an

10

equal balance, both rights are the same, the Government

11

does have some right to withdraw, then.

12

13
14

MR. FELDMAN:

The Government may be able to

withdraw under those circumstances.
I think a better way to look at that kind of a

15

case, though, is where there's been a charge-bargain plea

16

agreement the district court, at the time when it's called

17

upon to accept the agreement or not, is supposed to look

18

and see whether the charges that remain are commensurate

19

with what the defendant did, whether this agreement is in

20

the public interest.

21

So a better way to look at I think what happens

22

in those kinds of cases would be that the district court

23

would reject the plea agreement and, indeed, the

24

Government might point out to the district court reasons

25

why it should reject the plea agreement, but if the

1

district court doesn't -- and it's really up to the

2

district court.
If the district court disagrees and says, you

3
4

know, this seems like a perfectly -- there's nothing that

5

contravenes public policy, or the interests of the public,

6

or the application of the guidelines in this plea

agreement, then the district court will hold both parties

I'm a little puzzled as to your

Are you saying that at the time when the judge

11

makes his ruling on whether to accept it or not the

12

Government is -- open to the Government to argue you

3

should reject this agreement?

4

MR. FELDMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

No.

Because I thought you suggested -I think what the Government is --

7

I think the Government has always an obligation to the

8

court to be frank, and to bring to the court any facts

9

that may have come to its attention that maybe it didn't

20
21

even know before.
Now, plea agreements come in many different

22

shapes, and some of them do limit the kinds of things --

23

the Government makes commitments about the kinds of things

24

it will say to the district court.

It won't oppose a

1

whether the Government's comments at that point might be a

2

breach of the agreement is really another question.
It depends on what the agreement says.

3

There

4

may be an agreement where it's not at all, where the

5

Government says, we will bring to the court, and we're not

6

committing ourselves to telling the court anything in

7

particular.
But in any event, whatever the Government agreed

8

9

to I think it always has an obligation to the court to

10

inform it of the relevant facts that the court should know

11

in order to pass its judgment.
QUESTION:

12

Can you go back for a second to

13

Justice O'Connor's question, because this is another point

14

I'm not certain about from the briefs, and from having

15

read this.

16

Imagine we're in an (A) type bargain.

That's a

17

charge bargain.

18

very many of those, because it wasn't supposed to make a

19

difference to the sentence, but I guess for it to make a

20

difference to the sentence you have to be in a drug case,

21

what, where there's a mandatory minimum, or where you're

22

going to a telephone count from a possession, so there are

23

some where it makes a difference.

But the basic result in this case, I think, is

2

3

determined by the rules, because if I said under the Ninth

4

Circuit's rule -- first of all under Rule 32(e) the fair

5

and just reason business would have been really entirely

6

illusory.

It would apply for a matter of a few minutes.

7

And it's obvious if you look at that rule itself

8

and the purposes behind it and what the advisory committee

9

said when it added that in 1983, that was a rule -- that

10

was an important step.

It was intended to bolster the

11

respect and the dignity of plea proceedings.
Plea proceedings are governed by Rule 11, which

12

13

has in (A),

14

provisions about exactly how a plea has to be taken, all

15

the steps the judge has to take, which, in fact, the judge

16

took here, and that once the defendant has gone through

17

all of that, nobody should have the illusion that they're

18

just free to walk away from it with no consequences at

19

all, especially if they don't have a fair and just reason

20

to do so.

pleas.

3

It's quite clear it's talking about

It gets to (E), which is entitled Plea Agreement

4

Procedure, and (E) was the provision that was added to

5

deal with plea agreements, and the rule makes perfect

6

sense and is perfectly consistent in its very precise

7

differentiation between those provisions that have to do

8

with acceptance of a guilty plea, which has to do with the

9

defendant's confession in open court as to what he did,

10

and those provisions that have to do with the plea

11

agreement, which is an entirely different question, which

12

has to do with the nature of the bargain and is treated in

3
4

the (E) provision.
And indeed, in Rule

(e)(4), the provision that

5

we -- that was mentioned earlier, where it says that the

6

court -- that if the court rejects the plea agreement the

7

defendant shall be permitted to withdraw his plea, the

8

whole notion there that the defendant can withdraw the

9

plea I think has as its underlying assumption that there's

20

been a valid, binding plea entered at that point, and

21

there has been.

22

So I think the result that we're urging here is

23

dictated by the Federal rules.

24

we're urging here is dictated by the law of contracts.

defendant for a promise by the Government to do something

later, subject to a later condition, and everybody's bound

to that unless the condition -- once the plea is

5

accepted -- once the plea is accepted by the district

6

court, unless the later condition doesn't occur.

7

I think that if there -- under the Ninth

8

Circuit's rule there would be a great deal of instability

9

ejected into the plea-bargaining process.

A defendant at

10

any time during the several months that it takes to

11

prepare the presentence report can just say, I changed my

mind.

13

point, everything stops.

I don't want to go ahead and do this.

14

At that

Well, that is a process that's at the unilateral

15

whim of the defendant that's open to manipulation.

16

open to a defendant who wants to obtain severance from

17

codefendants to plead guilty and then just change his mind

18

19

20

could do that.

It's

It's open to the possibility that a defendant

It's even open to a defendant who sees that the

1

later there may be some witnesses who are unavailable.

2

There may be witnesses who are no longer in the

3

jurisdiction, or even, in a sufficiently extreme case, a

4

defendant might take steps to see to it that those things

5

happen.

6

All of those things can happen if you give the

7

defendant this free window of several months after the

8

plea to just change his mind, and I think if the advisory

9

committee had proposed that kind of a rule, I think it

10

clearly would have been rejected because of the

11

instability it lends to the process.

12

Another consequence it can have is that the

13

preparation of the presentence report itself ordinarily

14

requires the cooperation of both the defendant and the

15

Government.

16

Now, presumably if both parties are free to just

17

withdraw at whim during this period between the guilty

18

plea proceedings and the -- basically and sentencing, it

19

would be -- it's very hard for the parties to lend the

20

kind of cooperation to the probation officer that they

21

would have to do, since neither is sure that the

22

information that they're providing wouldn't ultimately

23

be -- they're now revealing it to a party who could

24

easily, at that party's own whim, become the opposing

25

party at a trial, and I think it would make preparation of

2

those reports very difficult.
And again, in this case, in fact, the

3

preparation of the presentence report was delayed while

4

all of this -- proceedings were going on in the district

5

court, because respondent wasn't cooperating with the

6

probation officer during that period.

7

Finally, I think that it's inconsistent with the

8

dignity and respect that judicial proceedings should have

9

that a formal Rule 11 proceeding in open court should

10

have -- should basically be able to be rendered a nullity

11

by the defendant's unilateral action.

12

A defendant -- if you read -- I think it's worth

looking at the plea proceeding here, which is in the joint

14

appendix, and it was all gone through very carefully with

15

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN D. SOGLIN

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14
15

MR. SOGLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The determinative question in this case is

16

whether the district court can accept a guilty plea before

17

it approves the plea agreement upon which it depends.

18

this case and in its earlier suit in Cordova-Perez, the

19

court of appeals correctly recognized that a plea and a

20

plea agreement are so inextricably bound up together that

21

deferral of acceptance of one carries with it the deferral

22

of acceptance of the other.

23

QUESTION:

In

Well, do you have to go against the

24

text of Rule 11(e) to do that, to take your position, and

25

the reason I ask the question is this.

I'm reading -- I'm

1

actually reading from the rule as it's set out on 4a of

2

the back of the Government's brief.

3

QUESTION:

Whereabouts, Justice Souter?

4

QUESTION:

The first paragraph, right at -- it's

5
6

the carryover paragraph at the beginning.
If the agreement is of the charge-bargaining or

7

the definite sentence type, the court may accept or reject

8

the agreement, or may defer its decision until there's

9

been an opportunity to accept the presentence report.

10

It's clear from that that the court does accept the

11

agreement, may, and effectively may under the rule,

12

without waiting.

Isn't that correct?

3

MR. SOGLIN:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.
Okay, and under the -- in the

5

following sentence, if the -agreement is of the type

6

specified in subdivision (B), the court may advise --

7

shall advise the defendant that if the court does not

8

accept the recommendation -- i.e., that which is part of

9

the agreement -- the defendant nevertheless has no right

20
2

to withdraw.
So in each of those instances, the (A), the (B),

22

and the (C) instance, the rule provides explicitly, as I

23

read it, for acceptance of the plea without regard to what

24

may ultimately happen to the terms of the agreement.

25

There are, of course, further provisions in the

1

(A) and (B) type, and there's a further provision, just

2

cause, for the -- (A) and (C) type and just cause

3

provision for the (B) type, but the text seems to me very

4

clear that the court may operatively accept the agreement

5

right then and there, and isn't that inconsistent with

6

your argument?
MR. SOGLIN:

7

I don't think so.

I think the rule

8

permits the judge to accept the agreement at the time of

9

the plea hearing, Rule 11 hearing, or may defer its

10

decision until later.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SOGLIN:

Yes.
Whether it's going to do that is

13

going to depend on the information available at that time,

14

and the petitioner has argued that deferral is required in

15

these cases, type (A) charge-bargain, or type (C) sentence

16

stipulation agreements, such that where there's deferral

17

in all of these cases, that in none of those cases can the

18

judge accept the agreement earlier and thus Rule 32(e)'s

19

fair and just standard disappears for that period of time.
That's not necessarily required.

20

The rules,

21

particularly Rule 32, permits the judge in fact to

sentence a defendant without a presentence report, and

23

there's certainly authority the judge can accept the plea

needed the judge can say, I accept your plea agreement,

2

and at that time the defendant is bound.
QUESTION:

3

Well, is it your point that the court

has got to use the magic word, accept?

think the case turns on, as distinct from the rule that

the Ninth Circuit employed?

Well, let me ask a different

Do you defend the rule that the Ninth Circuit

13

14

QUESTION:

Yes.
Well, the rule, as I understand it,

15

applied by the Ninth Circuit was that until the final

16

determination is made as to whether or not the terms of

17

the plea agreement will be honored, there is, in fact,

18

nothing binding upon the defendant, and the defendant can

anything.

Are you defending that position?

21

MR. SOGLIN:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.
How is that position consistent with

or may not be honored, and there being various

2

consequences that follow if they are not, but the text of

3

the rule seems very clear that the court may accept the

4

plea, even though we don't yet know what's going to happen

5

to the terms of the plea agreement.

6

MR. SOGLIN:

Justice Souter, I think I would

7

disagree that the rule says that the court could accept

8

the plea in that section.

9

QUESTION:

It says, may accept or reject, in the

10

one sentence and in the other it says, the court shall

11

advise the defendant that if the court does not accept the

12

recommendation or request of the defendant, the defendant

3

nevertheless has no right to withdraw the plea.

4

those pretty clear indications that the court may accept

5

the plea regardless of what happens later to the terms of

6

the plea agreement?

7

MR. SOGLIN:

Aren't

Only with the type (B) agreements.

8

In the first sentence that you referred to it refers to,

9

the court may accept or reject the agreement.

20

With type

(A) and type (C) agreements -- those are the charge-

21

bargain agreements and sentencing stipulation

22

agreements -- those are the types the court may defer

judge to approve of the agreement.

2

carries with it approval of the agreement in a case of the

3

type (B) sentencing recommendation agreement.

4

QUESTION:

Approval of the plea

So you would say in the (A) and (C)

5

cases, even if the judge says in open court I accept the

6

plea, but I will determine later on whether I will accept

7

the agreement, and I will wait until after the sentence

report, the judge's statement in that case simply is not

9

effective.

10

MR. SOGLIN:

It's not effective to the extent

11

the judge purports to bind the defendant to that plea.

12

may be effective to the extent the judge has made findings

13

that the plea has been entered knowingly and voluntarily.

14

The judge has gone through the litany of determining

15

whether it's knowing and voluntary.

16

QUESTION:

It

Mr. Soglin, I thought Rule 32 had

17

some bearing on the case, that says if a motion to

imposed, the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if

the defendant shows any fair and just reason.

that govern what happens here?

10

You say there's no difference between

MR. SOGLIN:

There's certainly a difference

between a plea and an agreement.

accept one without the other, and this is based on the

14

structure of Rule 11.

You can have plea

That rule was amended in 1974.

For the first

time that rule provided that the court could do what we've

just described, which is defer approval of the agreement

To make that review possible, Rule 32 was also

amended to permit review of the presentence report prior

21

to a conviction.

If the judge could accept the plea but not the

to permit that early review of the presentence report.
QUESTION:

I mean, but you can square it a

5

little bit with the language, but my goodness, I've never

6

seen anything like this before, where the -- I've never

7

seen this, what the Ninth Circuit has done before.
I thought that the basic idea of this whole

9

procedure is that the defendant pleads guilty, the judge

10

then calls for the presentence report, everybody gets a

11

chance to look at it, you know, and then of course the

12

defendant's bound if the judge accepts it.
Imagine the contrary.

13

The contrary would be the

defendant would sit there, he'd say, I plead guilty, but

15

it wouldn't mean anything.

QUESTION:

Mr. --

5

QUESTION:

So your -- is it your argument that

6

what the defendant has partially performed is sort of the

7

equivalent of what the Government would be disclosing in

8

the presentence report, so that therefore it's perfectly

9

fair for the defendant to be able to wait until the

presentence report is in to decide whether or not he wants

11

to withdraw his plea?

I

MR. SOGLIN:

That's right.

If you could

rephrase it -QUESTION:

Well, the question that Justice

19

Breyer raised was, if the defendant may withdraw at will

20

under a rule like the Ninth Circuit rule, then the

21

defendant can sit back and wait for a presentence report,

22

which is in fact going to be there before the judge

23

sentences in almost every case, and if the deal is not

24

final by the time he reads the report, he could simply

25

withdraw his plea.

And I thought that you -- and the implication

1

2

being that would be a very strange system for the rules to

3

provide, because that would give the defendant a terrific

4

advantage in discovery, and I thought your argument was,

5

well, the defendant is partially performing simply by

6

standing up and going through the plea colloquy.

7

The defendant is giving the Government something

8

which it might use as a lead to further investigation and

9

so on, and so therefore it's perfectly fair for the

10

defendant to get the benefit of the plea agreement if the

11

Government gets the benefit of this partial performance,

12

and I thought that was the ultimate point that you were

13

making.

14

Is -- do I understand you correctly?
MR. SOGLIN:

That was the point I was making. I

15

don't think that's the most fair situation.

16

is not what is presented by the facts of this case.

17

is not something that the Court necessarily has to reach

18

in deciding this case, whether the Government would be

free to withdraw if there's been some sort of reliance by

20

the defendant.

MR. SOGLIN:

As opposed to the plea agreement.
Correct.
We're talking -- now we're dealing

5

with two separate things, a plea of guilty, and a separate

6

plea agreement.

7

MR. SOGLIN:

Yes.

I think there are actually

8

three things that could be meant by the term, plea of

9

guilty.

It could be a defendant tendering a plea -- as

10

petitioner has stated there are circumstances that are

11

rare where a defendant tenders a plea and the judge -QUESTION:

Well, when you say tenders a plea,

13

does it talk about tendering a plea here?

You either plead guilty or you don't plead

I don't know whether you tender it.
MR. SOGLIN:

Where a defendant says I plead

17

guilty is what I've been referring to as a tendered plea.

18

An accepted plea, which is what petitioner has stated is

required before Rule 32(e) applies, is where the judge

says I accept the plea.

1

But you say somehow the rules don't

permit a separation of a plea of guilty and a plea

agreement.

4

MR. SOGLIN:

QUESTION:

That's right.
But textually it clearly does in the

I mean, there's an express provision that

7

says the judge will tell him that if I don't ultimately

8

follow the recommendation -- i.e., in a (B) situation --

9

you still can't withdraw the plea, so clearly there is an

10

irrefutable textual basis for saying that he can accept

the plea leaving the plea agreement in limbo in that

circumstance, right? â–

MR. SOGLIN:

QUESTION:

12

The provisions for withdrawal of the

13

pleas if, in fact, the agreements are not accepted and

14

kept.

15

MR. SOGLIN:

Well, the provision for withdrawal

16

of the plea in Rule 32(e) doesn't describe whether it's

17

talking about a tendered plea, an accepted plea, a plea

18

where both the plea and the agreement have been accepted.

19

QUESTION:

And the answer to that may be, just

20

as Justice Scalia said, a plea is a plea, and once it's

21

there, it's operative unless, in fact, it is subject to

22

one of these withdrawal or reexamination provisions.

23

MR. SOGLIN:

Well, again, the petitioner has

24

conceded that that's not the case, and I think the answer

25

may be in the Mabry case of this Court, where the Court

1

held that the agreement is not binding until accepted by

2

the court, and in that case it was a situation where the

3

Government had made an offer which defendant accepted.

4

The Government then attempted to withdraw.

The

5

defendants sought enforcement of that offer, the withdrawn

6

offer, and the Court said no, you hadn't -- that offer had

7

not been approved by the court.
QUESTION:

8

9

Mr. Soglin, if you look at the --

or -- you've witnessed Rule 11 pleas, and it was with all

10

due solemnity, and the district judge is telling the

11

defendant all of his rights, and the defendant pleads

12

guilty.

13

Now, one wouldn't perceive of that procedure in

14

court as something that's tentative, so there's something

15

that doesn't quite fit, and the rules are meticulous in

16

instructing the judge about advising the defendant of his

17

rights, and anyone who comes into a courtroom and sees

18

that that's how we do justice in the United States, and --

19

but then you say that this is just an ephemeral thing,

20

that it's not real, that when the judge says now, knowing

21

all that, do you plead guilty, and the defendant says yes,

22

and the judge says I accept it, that all that is kind of

23

make-believe.

7

prosecutions for obstruction of justice are pretty rare.

This won't happen.

They're -- you're not even -- even perjury

MR. SOGLIN:

They are rare.

It is possible, and

10

I would rely more on the loss of acceptance of

11

responsibility, which is -- very often could be what

12

motivates the defendant to plead, is that reduction, which

13

can be significant, up to 20 percent, 30 percent reduction

14

in sentence, which they're not going to get if they go to

15

trial.

withdrawing from these pleas.

17

That's a tremendous deterrent in defendants

The -- finally, the -- it's been mentioned

18

earlier that the rate of conviction by plea agreements, by

19

guilty pleas is 90 percent, or has been over 90 percent.

20

It has been that high for quite a bit of time, since -- at

21

least since the 1960's, and we cited some reference to

22

statistics like that, so there are -- there's a great deal

23

of stability in guilty pleas.

There is -- if something significant has been
offered to defendant they're going to plead guilty and

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15

MR. FELDMAN:

I just had one point I wanted to

make.

16

For purposes of this case -- this is in response

17

to Justice Scalia's question -- we have accepted that it's

18

the -- that at least at the latest time when the district

19

court accepts the plea the parties are bound.

20

Now, whether at some earlier point the parties

21

may be bound or not is really not something that arises

22

here, because it was done so carefully in this case, and

23

that -- we've said that in our brief.

I guess -- it's hard for me to

answer, because I do think there are several of them, but

I think 32(e) would be rendered a nullity in a -- most

5

cases if the Ninth Circuit's view were right, and I don't

6

think that rendering -- I think that that would be the

7

strongest one in my view.

I also think there are provisions of Rule 11, as

9

I mentioned before, that clearly distinguish between pleas

and plea agreements.
