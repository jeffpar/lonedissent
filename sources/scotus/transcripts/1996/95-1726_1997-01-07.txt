CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the validity of commentary in

10

the Federal sentencing guidelines that governs sentencing

11

of career offenders.

12

Congress directed that the sentencing guidelines

13

specify a sentence at or near the maximum term authorized

14

for the identified categories of career offenders.

15

Amendment 506 to the guidelines, however, the commission

16

specified that the statutory sentence enhancements for

17

recidivists shall not be used in calculating the maximum

18

term authorized under the career offender guideline.

19

In

Thus, where a Federal narcotics law specifies

20

that a first offender shall receive a sentence with a

21

maximum of 20 years and a second offender shall receive a

22

sentence subject to a 30-year maximum, the commission

23

treats the maximum term authorized as 20 years.

24

view, the commission's disregard of recidivist

25

enhancements conflicts with the Sentencing Reform Act and

In our

is invalid.

2

The starting point for analysis of this question

3

is the text of the Sentencing Reform Act, which is set out

4

in our brief in the appendix at page 21a, and it provides

5

in section 994(h) of title 28 that the commission shall

6

assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of

7

imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for

8

categories of defendants, and then it goes on to specify

9

that the defendants must be 18 years of age or older and

10

be convicted of a felony that was a crime of violence or a

11

specified Federal drug offense and have two prior

12

convictions of the same type.

13

The text of this statute in our view is clear.

14

The maximum term authorized refers to the maximum, the

15

uppermost limit of a range, thus, where there is a range

16

consisting of two possible uppermost limits the higher of

17

the two is the maximum.

18

QUESTION:
maximum.

MR. DREEBEN:

20
21

Your position is that maximum means

Justice Scalia.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. DREEBEN:

24
25

That is absolutely correct,

But authorized by what?
Maximum term authorized by

statute.
QUESTION:

No, I know, but by what statute?

I

mean, what we have are, we have statutes that authorize a

2

maximum of 15 years or 30 years for a second offense, this

3

intent with -- possession with intent to distribute a --

4

MR. DREEBEN:

5

QUESTION:

Controlled substance.

-- controlled substance, and then we

6

have statutes that say if you do this near a school it's

7

an extra thing, and then if you did it with -- another

8

extra thing -- I mean, like, there -- does it mean the

9

maximum authorized by whatever combination of statutes put

10

together produces the most individually tailored,

11

statutorily tailored sentence for this defendant, or does

12

it mean authorized by the statute that deals with the

13

substantive crime, or some combination in between?

14

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I think that it actually

15

means the maximum term authorized by statute for the

16

particular offender.

17

QUESTION:

So in other words they have to have a

18

whole proliferating schedule within the guidelines so that

19

you'd have, for a person who, in fact, is a second

20

offender of a cocaine possession with intent to

21

distribute, and in the course of that he injures another

22

person, and he does it near a school, and you know, there

23

you have a footnote with about six other things, and then

24

there are -- and there has to be one schedule for that

25

person.

And then you have to have another schedule for

2

somebody who did exactly the same thing but not near a

school, and then you have to have another schedule for

4

somebody who did the exact same thing but it didn't

involve an injury or death.

6

Is that the view - -

7

MR. DREEBEN:

I think this would have been the

8

easiest statute in the commission's repertoire for it to

9

implement.

QUESTION:

10
11

All the commission would have had to say is Yes, but I mean I understand that we

could have taken it that way, but I'm -MR. DREEBEN:

12

-- a sentence at or near the

13

maximum is a sentence within 15 or 20 percent or 25

14

percent of the maximum, and for any defendant who's

15

covered by section 994(h), when the sentencing court

16

determines what his authorized statutory maximum term is,

17

the range is X percent less than that up to the top.

18

QUESTION:
thirds.

Well, this is pretty much near a two

It's two-thirds, or 75 percent -MR. DREEBEN:

Well, it is not -- it is not for

21

an offender like LaBonte, and I think that it's important

22

to keep in mind exactly what is going on here.

23

LaBonte is exposed to a maximum term -- I don't

24

think there's any dispute whatsoever --by statute of 30

25

years, which is 360 months, and under the career offender

guideline as it existed prior to the time of

Amendment 506, that would have produced a base offense

level of 34, which is 262 months to 327 months, or 21 to

4

27 years.

5

year maximum.

6

That is 72 percent to 90 percent of the 30-

Under the commission's approach, Amendment 506,

7

an offender like LaBonte is treated as if his maximum term

8

is 20 when it's actually 30, and he's assigned a base

9

offense level of 32, which produces a sentencing range of

10

210 months to 262 months, or 58 percent to 72 percent of

11

the 30-year max, so I think that there's quite a

12

significant drop-off --

13

QUESTION:

Yes but -- I'm sorry, I didn't get an

14

answer to my original question, which I -- because I

15

unfortunately got distracted.

16

Is it your view, is it the Government's view

17

that when a person commits a second cocaine offense and a

18

death results, and it occurs within a thousand -- leave

19

the death out, a thousand feet of the highway truck stop

20

with a weapon, that the maximum authorized means the

21

maximum authorized by the combination of those sentences,

22

of all those statutes together?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

So you'd have to go through the --

that's the only way -- and you think that's clear?

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't think the word categories

does add a lot under the statute, Justice Kennedy, and I

wouldn't suggest to the Court that under our view of the

statute it has huge operative significance, but I think in

at or near the maximum:

violence, or you commit one of the Federal drug offenses

3

that are identified and listed in the statute, and you

have two prior convictions of the same type.

5

either, you commit a crime of

So you have the category of violent offenders

6

with two prior convictions, you have the category of drug

7

offenders with two prior convictions, and the structure of

8

section 994(h) supports the view that that is the intended

9

reading of categories, the types of defendants that are

10

covered.

May I ask a fact question before you

get too deeply into the argument?

MR. DREEBEN:

Certainly.

Correct.

Because you're not taking into the

career offender factors there.

MR. DREEBEN:

1

Yes.

Yes,

I do.

I don't recall

2

the exact guideline sentence for the three respondents in

3

this case, but suffice it to say that it would have been

4

substantially lower than the career offender sentence.

5

The career - QUESTION:

or - -

Would it have been roughly a third,

a third or a half,

8

MR. DREEBEN:

9

QUESTION:

10

something like that?

I'd be willing to accept that.

If -- so in other words,

if it was a

third it might have been 7 or 8 years.

11

MR. DREEBEN:

12

QUESTION:

Correct.

Whereas -- and if you then say that

13

you should take -- and the normal third of the 30 years

14

would have been 10 years, absent the requirement that it

15

be at or near the maximum, but now the - - under the

16

commission's view it is at or near the maximum of 20 years

17

because of the guideline provision,

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Right.

isn't it?

If the maximum were in

19

fact 20 years we might not have any quarrel with what the

20

commission had done, but the maximum isn't 20 years.

21

QUESTION:

No,

I understand that, but even

22

interpreting the at or near maximum the way the commission

23

does, you do get a substantially higher sentence for a

24

career offender than you would absent the statute.

25

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, you do.

1

QUESTION:

Yes.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

And if the statute had only said

3

substantial sentence, or substantially higher sentence, we

4

would have a different case.

5

I was trying to elucidate the meaning of

6

categories, and I think that this will tie in with your

7

question, Justice Stevens.

8

which is on page 22a of our appendix, lists another group

9

of offenders that the commission wanted -- that the

10

Section 994 (i) of the statute,

Congress wanted the commission to treat in a special way.

11

In section 994(i), the commission is directed to

12

assure that the following categories of defendants receive

13

a substantial term of imprisonment, and then it goes on to

14

list five categories of defendants that are to receive a

15

substantial term of imprisonment.
Now, substantial is certainly a qualitative word

16
17

that admits of a broad range of meanings, and the

18

commission may very well have fulfilled a duty to impose a

19

substantial sentence on the career offenders under the

20

guidelines as it has written it, but Congress has singled

21

out the career offenders identified in section 994(h), the

22

categories of career offenders there, for different

23

treatment.

24
25

That treatment is perhaps the most specific
direction that Congress gave the commission anywhere in

the sentencing guidelines.

2

or near the maximum, and it's our view that that provision

3

means exactly what it says.

4

It was to assure a sentence at

Now, the implausibility of the commission's

5

approach of disregarding recidivists in the enhancements

6

is particularly implausible in light of the various

7

statutes that are identified in the career offender

8

provision as calling for career offender treatment.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, the problem we have in

10

this case stems from a new commentary adopted by the

11

commission to section 4B1.1 of the guidelines.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

14

And what precisely are you asking us

to provide if that commentary is wrong?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

16

QUESTION:

17

Invalidate --

What are you asking us to do,

invalidate -- invalidate the commentary?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

QUESTION:

20

That is right, Justice O'Connor.

That is right.

And we treat the commentary as a rule

or regulation or something?

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, not even so exalted a status

22

as rule or regulation.

23

Stinson v. United States that commentary plays generally

24

the role of elucidating what the guidelines mean.

25

not legislative rules in their own right.

The

QUESTION:

It's

-- I mean, the ambiguity, if

2

there is one, I think is in the word authorized.

3

Authorized by what?

4

ambiguity, but that's where it would be, and the problem

5

that I see is if you -- it's obviously a close question.

6

I'm not sure what I think about it.

7

I don't know if there is an

But the authorized, if you take your

8

interpretation of it you'll suddenly discover a, you know,

9

very bizarre set of sentences, what I would think of.

10

example, if you distribute cocaine or amphetamines or

11

barbiturates, or one ounce of marijuana near a truck stop,

12

and you do that twice, you're going to get three times the

13

normal sentence.

14

For

The normal sentence has already been doubled

15

because you did that twice, so you're going to end up with

16

life sentences for things like an ounce of cocaine, or

17

let's say an ounce of marijuana distributed twice in a

18

truck stop.

19

And moreover, rather than what Congress

20

suggested, that these are maxes, so you could have a

21

lesser sentence, they suddenly become mandatory minimums.

22

They're mandatory minimums because nobody would have any

23

choice, and are we really to attribute that intent to

24

Congress, that they wanted to turn all these things like

25

truck stop distributions and so forth into life sentences?

just look at the category of offenders who were covered by

the basic statutory violation.

think, on anybody's theory if you look at it closely.

That doesn't work, I

Under section 841(a), which is the basic Federal

The violation is possession of a

That is the statutory violation.

MR. DREEBEN:

And if you lump together everybody

12

who violates section 841(a) and say, what is the highest

13

sentence that all of them could receive under

14

section 841(b), you end up with 5, or maybe 10 years under

Congress intended that these most serious offenders in the

And since all violators of any Federal -- who

the sentencing factors, I don't think it's possibly

reasonable to suppose that Congress intended a category

consisting of all 841(a) violators without regard to their

recidivist enhancements, or without regard to the kind of

controlled substance that they possess.

Congress very carefully calibrated the statutory

maximums that are applicable to a controlled substance

offender depending on the type of controlled substance,

the harm that resulted, and the prior record.

Now, what makes it particularly inapposite to

20

adopt the commission's view is that section 840 -- section

21

994(h) is designed to target recidivist offenders.

22

statutes that are referenced in section 994(h), the

The legislature would have had every reason to

It was logically possible to have somebody with

the offenders who are covered by the career offender

and so what would be odd in Congress thinking what we mean

2

by this word authorized is the part that is authorized for

a first offender of the substantive crime?

4

What would be the odd result you would be

5

distinguishing if you took that, among all the different

categories of drugs, because A, B, C and D do that, and

7

you would have quite different -- you'd have quite

different maximums authorized for a marijuana person from

a cocaine person, from a big guy, from a little guy, all

for the first offense, so what would be odd about Congress

meaning that?

So what you have is Congress, on its mind at the

maximum terms authorized for these categories of drug

telling the commission here you have repeat offenders of

specified Federal drug offenders -- and we're going to

list them in the statute -- sentence these people distinct

from all others, add on your maximum terms authorized, and

in that context I think that it becomes entirely

implausible to suggest that Congress meant the first

But the other possible double counting objection

is that the same prior conviction is used both to enhance

15

to be double counting for some reason.

QUESTION:

I speculated that what you had in

mind -- maybe this is the first thing you said -- is that

the commission could say criminal history -- essentially

criminal history is not relevant in the guidelines when

you have a maximum term under this statute.

MR. DREEBEN:

I think that's exactly right,

What the commission could do in that

The commission in fact had proposals before it

QUESTION:

The other reason against doing

that -- I'd be curious if you'd comment on it.

meant was where it says a first offender gets up to 20

years, up to, what they meant by this is, he gets 20

20

years, period, or what you're arguing.

21

And one concern was, if you take what you argue,

22

that really turns the power to decide what the sentence is

23

directly over to the prosecutor, because in most of these

24

cases you can't go beyond 20 years unless the prosecutor

I'm just putting that to you so

I'm not sure, Justice Breyer, that

it is totally contrary to the whole philosophy of the

guidelines.

9

The impetus of the guidelines was to eliminate

10

unwarranted disparity by different judges who have

11

different sentencing philosophies.

12

and cannot eliminate prosecutorial discretion and, given

13

that Congress has vested the prosecutor with the

14

authority, as you say, to raise the maximum by filing a

15

reply or pretrial notice of crimes, Congress has vested

16

discretion in the prosecutor.

17

The guidelines do not

I don't think the commission can say that is an

18

unwarranted disparity.

That is a product of prosecutorial

19

discretion which is an endemic and universal feature of

20

Federal criminal law, and the Sentencing Commission was

21

not given the task, which would probably be

22

unconstitutional anyway, of attempting to eliminate

23

prosecutorial discretion in the enforcement of Federal

24

criminal law, and so I don't think that there's any

argument there that the disparity is unwarranted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID N. YELLEN
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. YELLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

13

Justice Breyer's colloquy with Mr. Dreeben I

14

think fairly clearly points out that there are various

15

ways of reading the language of the maximum term

16

authorized for categories of offenders, and a critical

17

point that did not come out in the Government's argument

18

is that Congress considered and expressly rejected giving

19

a directive to sentencing courts to impose a maximum,

20

ordinary maximum term.

21

That was in the 1982 bill that passed the Senate

22

but the Senate the next time, the next year rejected that

23

and instead gave this more general instruction to the

24

Sentencing Commission, putting this obligation under

1

obligations.
And what the Sentencing Commission did here was

2

3

looked at all of its obligations, including first and

4

foremost under the statute to provide certainty and

5

fairness and reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity,

6

and the commission decided that the prosecutor having the

7

ability to in effect determine the sentence by this 851

8

mechanism was something that would contribute to

9

unwarranted disparity.
QUESTION:

10

Well, how -- why was Congress -- why

11

was the commission in a position to second guess Congress

12

on that?

13

very provisions that the commission is supposed to be

14

proposing sentences for, why is that any business of the

15

commission?

16

If the prosecutorial discretion comes from the

MR. YELLEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, the discretion

17

that the prosecutor has under 851 and 841 is to raise the

ceiling, to raise the maximum term allowed, and it's then

not up to the prosecutor to decide what the actual

sentence is.

it's a truly bad case that warrants a longer sentence.

mandatory minimums, and they've passed mandatory

QUESTION:

4

MR. YELLEN:

When they passed 994(h).
That's right, and 994(h) directs a

5

sentence at or near the maximum applicable to the

6

categories of defendants, not defined clearly as Mr.

7

Dreeben suggested in this statute, but very broadly.

8

9

I think it's quite plausible to read that
language to say that one way to categorize all of the

10

offenders defined in 994(h) is to take everyone who's been

11

convicted of violating the same statute and treat them as

12

one category, and then those defendants against whom the

13

Government has filed 851 information and are therefore

14

eligible for, say a 30-year sentence rather than a 20-

15

year sentence, they will receive that longer sentence if

16

there are aggravating factors - -

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. YELLEN:

Well --- under the guidelines or

19

aggravating factors that warrant a departure above the

20

guidelines.

21

QUESTION:

Well, that goes to explain the

22

ambiguity, I guess, but even assuming the ambiguity -- I

23

do assume the ambiguity -- it's difficult for me to

understand why the authorization would be to eliminate the

when Congress has expressly granted prosecutorial

discretion.

3

Congress in effect says prosecutorial discretion

4

is a good thing.

5

the commission to say we should somehow, if not eliminate,

6

at least liminate -- limit the effects of this discretion

7

which Congress has expressly conferred?

8

9

Why, therefore, is it appropriate for

MR. YELLEN:

Well, Justice Souter, the

discretion -- the prosecutorial discretion that Congress

10

has said is to be enhanced is the prosecutor's discretion

11

to seek a higher maximum term, not to seek a higher

12

specific term.

13

The 851 mechanism, the way it always worked

14

before the guidelines came into effect and the way it

15

continues to work today for people who are not career

16

offenders is that the filing of the information allows a

17

sentence of more than 20, to use the facts of these cases,

18

and up to 30 years, but not automatically at the

19

prosecutor's choice.

20

QUESTION:

The prosecutor gets to - Well, that's quite true, but the

21

presumed effect will be, by giving prosecutors that

22

discretion and by giving courts authority based upon the

prosecutorial exercise of that discretion, the natural

effect in the mind run of cases will be to increase

policy to eliminate an effect which has so explicitly been

2

granted and, I have to assume, intended?

3

MR. YELLEN:

But the effect is still there, the

4

effect of raising the ceiling, that all of the defenders

5

in this case could have received sentences - - under the

6

commission's Amendment 506 they could have received

7

sentences longer than 20 years, up to and including 30

8

years, if, as is very commonly the case with career

9

offenders, there was a large quantity of drugs, or there

10

was the use of a gun, or there were any other aggravating

11

factors.
If I could answer Justice Stevens' question

12

13

before on the facts of the case, because I think it

14

illustrates something here, this was not a threefold

15

increase from the original guideline range based on

16

Amendment 506 interpretation of the career offender level,

17

but in respondent Dyer's case it was a 13-fold increase.
It took -- the regular guideline range for Dyer

19

was 18 to 24 months.

2

think deference to the commission is entirely consistent

3

with Chevron and other -- and well-established principles.
QUESTION:

4

Nr. Yellen, before we get to Chevron,

5

Judge Stahl on the First Circuit said that he didn't

6

consider the reading you're proposing a plausible one.

7

said that he found it inherently implausible because it

8

effectively nullifies criminal history enhancements

9

carefully enacted into statute by 841, and I think you

10

have agreed that it does do that. The Sentencing

11

Commission has effectively taken away the effect of the

12

enhancements.
MR. YELLEN:

13

No, Justice Ginsburg, I disagree

14

with that, and maybe I haven't said it clearly.

15

again.

16

sentence enhancements of 841 with the 851 mechanism were

17

enacted, what it did was, if the prosecutor files under

18

851 the maximum is higher.

19

I disagree with that very strongly.

I'll try

When the

20

ever to receive one day longer in prison because the

23

today for people who are not career offenders.

That was up to the

So under the commission's interpretation of
section 4B1.1, it works like this.

1

committed a crime that would have had a 20-year maximum.

2

Because of his prior record and the Government's filing

3

under 851, he now could receive a 30-year sentence.

4

The guideline is based on the 20-year maximum,

5

but if there are any aggravating factors in the case that

6

make him a worse than normal offender -- large amount of

7

drugs, use of a weapon, a leadership role in the offense,

8

or anything else that the guidelines don't consider which

9

warrant a departure -- the judge can impose a sentence

10

above the career offender level, above 20 years all the

11

way up to 30 years, so in fact it's the Government's view

12

of the case that would dramatically alter the intended

13

effect of an 851 filing.

14

Congress in 851 isn't saying we want prosecutors

15

to have the power to set sentences.

16

want prosecutors to have the power to raise the maximum,

17

and it's up to the other actors in the system, judges and

18

now the Sentencing Commission --

19

QUESTION:

They're saying we

Mr. Yellen, I'm not sure I fully

20

grasp your answer, because I thought the very purpose of

21

the Sentencing Commission's exercise here was to treat

22

alike cases where the prosecutor had asked for enhancement

23

and cases where they hadn't where the defendant's conduct

24

was the same.

MR. YELLEN:

They're only alike as a starting

point.

The way the career offender guideline works is,

2

you get a level 32.

3

regular application of the guidelines isn't higher.

4

judge also has to go through the regular routine rules of

5

the guidelines -- look at the amount of drugs, the use of

6

a weapon, injury, leadership role -- and if that comes out

7

to a level 34 or 5 or 6, that's the sentence the judge

8

must impose, not the level 32 that the career offender

9

guideline points to.

But you only get a level 32 if the
The

10

Secondly, if there are other aggravating factors

11

that the guidelines don't take into account, the judge can

12

decide under the standards in Koon that this is a case

13

that warrants an upward departure, so level 32 isn't high

14

enough because this guy is not only a career offender but

15

he's got a criminal record a mile long, and therefore

16

level 32 is not enough.

QUESTION:

But it's still -- it lets the judge

19

then treat alike two defendants who have the same history

20

in every respect, but in one case the prosecutor went for

21

enhancement and the other the prosecutor didn't.

22

MR. YELLEN:

That's right, and the commission's

23

rationale for that is to do otherwise would be to invite

24

unwarranted disparity.

But why is the disparity unwarranted

when the authority which is the predicate of the

disparity -- that is, the prosecutor's discretion -- is

specifically conferred by law?

5

have the authority to say that that is an unwarranted

6

disparity?

7

MR. YELLEN:

Why does the commission

In the commission's view it's

8

unwarranted because you have, under the Government's view

9

of the statute, two defendants who have committed the same

10

crime.

11

difference is that the defendant in one of the cases is

12

one of the 2.5 percent of eligible people against whom the

13

Government has filed --

14

They have the same criminal record.

QUESTION:

The only

Oh, I think I understand that.

The

15

commission I take it is really saying, look, we have an

16

obligation here within certain limits to equalize

17

sentences for given offenses, and we're taking that

18

obligation seriously.

19

But in taking that obligation seriously, as they

20

do here, they are in effect saying the obligation to

21

equalize sentences for a given offense, forgetting

22

extraneous details which might raise it up or raise it

23

down, is more important than the effect of the

Is that a legitimate choice for the commission

MR. YELLEN:

It is, because Congress has not

expressly answered this question before the court.

6

QUESTION:

Well,

it hasn't expressly answered

7

it, but what it has done is to give a general rule and

8

then a very specific authorization to prosecutors, which

9

will in the natural course have an effect of creating,

in

offense, and don't we generally say the specific governs

12

the general, and if that's the case here, does the

commission really have a legitimate option to say no, we

think the general philosophy is more important than the

it true that the commission's interpretation either

The strongest argument -- I think

20

this is the same point, but I thought one of the strongest

21

arguments the SG made was in the very same statute where

22

the sentencing guidelines were enacted into law, there --

23

Congress enacted a provision that said 20 years for a

24

first offender, being cocaine, or -- up to 20 years, or up

25

to 40 years for a second, okay.

Now, why would they have done that if, in fact,

1

2

this provision that we're talking about is keyed to the

3

first offense, because the provision keyed to the first

4

offense would have given everybody, everybody who is the

5

second offender the 20 years that's the max for the first

6

offender?

7

And your response to that is, oh, but there are

8

some cases where you would have wanted to go higher,

9

namely a case of a departure, or a case where the

10

underlying substantive offense is in fact like

11

distributing a pound of crack in a prison with a gun, so

12

you get to level 36 or 38 anyway.
At which point Justice Souter says, yes, that's

3
4

true, I'm not saying there are no such cases, but there

5

are so few that how could we really think that Congress

6

meant the interpretation that you're advancing, or

wouldn't it have viewed this as a kind of unnecessary

provision to stick in?
Am I -- I'm trying to basically rephrase,

2

to under the guidelines, but the judge can only do that

3

under the system of guidelines if there is an aggravating

4

factor in the guidelines or a basis for a departure, so

5

the commission's reading -- the commission's

6

implementation of 4B1.1 doesn't change that at all.

7

All unwarranted disparity that Congress was

8

after came from the exercise of lawful discretion.

9

Congress was concerned about judicial discretion, the

10

impact it had on disparity, but that was lawful, all

11

lawful exercise of discretion.

12

Similarly here, prosecutors can through their

13

exercise of discretion wind up with disparities that the

14

commission is charged with trying to regulate.

15

I was mentioning before that in only 2.5 percent

16

of all cases, according to Sentencing Commission data that

17

we submitted to the Court, does the Government seek these

18

enhanced maximums, so you wind up with a case where two

19

defendants who have committed the same violation and have

20

the same criminal record can get vastly different

21

sentences, not because the judge or the Sentencing

22

Commission thinks that any difference is appropriate, but

rather simply because the Government has filed the

enhancement.

saying, that if you're going to be consistent you would

I can understand you saying, yes, that Judge

Stahl was right, it effectively nullifies the enhancement,

For these defendants under Amendment 506 the

career offender level is 32 criminal history category 6,

4

can -- is required to compute the guideline range without

regard to the career offender guideline, look at the

amount of drugs, the weapon, and all of the other factors.

7

And the way the guidelines were written, in many

8

cases, particularly for career offenders who have long

criminal records and are likely to be involved in very

serious drug crimes, unlike the respondents in this case,

are above the unenhanced statutory minimum.
