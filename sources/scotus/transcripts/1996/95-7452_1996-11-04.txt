to statutory law, the State established a release date for

October 1 of 1992.

QUESTION:

Mr. Remland, may I interrupt you for

a moment?

State arrived at in determining what the release date was

6

was calculated under the statute that was in existence at

7

the time of the offense, the '83 statute which is set out

8

on page 27 of the lodging, or whether that figure was

9

calculated under one of the later statutes?

10

Can you tell me whether the figure that the

11

calculated under one of the successor statutes, but I want

12

to make sure on that.

QUESTION:

Okay.

Now, if we to -- I'm sorry.

17

If we were to conclude that under the Ex Post Facto Clause

18

the only statute that should be considered was the one in

19

effect at the time of the offense, I take it the figure

20

that they calculated and the date which they arrived at

21

would have been different.

22

MR. REMLAND:

It's hard to say, because the

23

actual statute in effect in 1985, which was 944-598, had

24

not been triggered at that point, and the credits did not

25

start to issue until a successor statute administrative

QUESTION:

Yes, but that may not support an Ex

Post Facto argument.

That might support -- just assume

10

for the sake of argument here that that might just support

11

a due process claim, which is not what we have before us,

12

and I take it the only thing we can say for sure is that

13

if the calculation were made under the statute as in

14

existence at the time of the offense, we don't know that

15

the number arrived at would have been the same number that

16

was awarded under the later statute.

17

MR. REMLAND:

I believe the number would have

18

been the same, for two reasons.

First of all, in 1985

QUESTION:

Mr. Remland --

2

QUESTION:

Well, I thought your principal

3

response to this was that it simply was not raised in the

4

opposition to the petition for certiorari.

MR. REMLAND:

That is correct.

It was not -- it

was never raised to the petition for certiorari.

The

When we took this case we thought we

were dealing with a situation which involved a change of

10

the punishment that existed at the time the crime was

11

committed.

12

MR. REMLAND:

Justice Scalia, you did, as a

13

matter of fact, because in 1985, when the offense was

14

committed, the offense formula was basically the same as

15

it was in '83 earlier under the statute.

16

QUESTION:

Well, does that mean we should decide

17

this case on a factually erroneous premise, the fact that

18

it wasn't raised in the brief in opposition?

19

MR. REMLAND:

I think that the actual issue was

20

presented squarely under the statute in effect at the time

21

of the offense under the emergency gain time statute which

22

Mr. Lynce was eligible for under 98 percent of population

23

cap, and he was offense-eligible according to law.

That statute was applied to no one,

It was never applied, that statute.

It

These --

That was all later, but the statute

7

that was on the books at the time the offense was

committed is a statute that was never applied to anyone.

9

It's a little hard to talk about anything ex post facto

10

with respect to a law that was never applied to anyone.
MR. REMLAND:

11

It's our position that the statute

12

that was in effect in 1985 was essentially the same

13

statute that was in effect in 1988 when the credits were

14

being granted, and moreover there's no question that the

15

effect of the change substantially increased the

16

petitioner's punishment, and that would constitute a

17

violation of the ex post facto law, the Ex Post Facto

18

Clause.

19

It's clear that we've got a substantial increase

20

in punishment over that that occurred at the time of the

offense, and the statutory formula in 1985 was

established.

But Mr. Remland, what about -- the

one really say that it was going to operate, or it wasn't

MR. REMLAND:

8

It was a brand new thing on an

Justice Ginsburg, the formula was

9

adopted in 1983 under the Sentencing Reform Act, and that

10

formula was the sentence of the Court minus the gain time

11

equals the actual sentence.

12

Florida statute 921 authorized any and all gain time to be

13

deducted from the actual sentence imposed, and in 1985 and

14

1986 there was an overcrowding problem, there's no

15

question about that, and that overcrowding problem

16

continued.

17

In this particular matter,

The contention or speculative nature of these

18

credits doesn't really impact the fact that the effect of

19

the '92 act totally and retroactively increased the

20

measure of punishment. It stiffened the measure of

21

punishment.

you a variant of Justice Ginsburg's question?

2

over the statute as you've provided it to us in the

3

lodging, the statute that was in effect at the time of the

4

offense, and it's not clear to me from reading that

5

statute whether any reduction that did not result in the

6

release of a particular prisoner would have survived the

7

termination of the emergency.

8
9

It is not clear to me from the statute, for
example, that if your client got a 30-day reduction at

10

some point because there was an emergency during his

11

incarceration, but he was not released as a result of it

12

because the reduction didn't get him down to that point,

13

it's not clear to me from the statute that the reduction

14

would have sort of remained on the books, if you will, as

15

a permanent reduction in his sentence once the population

16

had dropped down and that emergency was passed.

17

And I guess my question is, isn't that another

18

reason for saying that under the statute as it existed

19

when he committed his offense it is at best speculative

20

whether he would have obtained the kind of long-term

21

permanent reduction benefit that you are claiming he has

22

been denied improperly here?

23

MR. REMLAND:

Justice Souter, the focus of the

24

inquiry for ex post facto purposes should be the effect of

25

the '92 law.

1

speculative nature of whether or not the trigger is going

2

to be reached.

3

QUESTION:

But I think what I'm trying to get at

4

is that the effect of the '92 law depends on what he might

5

have been entitled to under the law that was changed and

6

if, in fact, under the law that was changed, under the '83

7

act if that's what we're going to consider, it is not even

8

clear that he would have been entitled to retain his

9

credit beyond the termination of the emergency during

10

which it was granted, then I can't say that the later

11

statute took away anything.

At best I would say, well, it's speculative as

to whether it took away anything.

they used -- they used release date, they used -- there's

2

several different words that they've used, but in each

3

case the language of the statute is crystal clear, and it

says that a person shall be released on that date.

The reason they use the name provisional is

because they adopted a successor statute to emergency gain

MR. REMLAND:

It would appear that the cases

dealing with ex post facto doctrine have dealt primarily

with two points, whether or not the law is retrospective

Do you have a fallback position that it only

MR. REMLAND:

Our position, Justice O'Connor, is

5

that the formula in 1985 was in place, and that provided

him with a statutory formula for ex post facto analysis

against the harsher, more onerous formula that was enacted

in 1992 by retroactive application through the Attorney

time statutes might exist, and I don't think that kind of

2

a reliance interest is required for a claim under the ex

post facto clause.

4

However, I do think that reliance is one of the

5

interest as well as expectations that the ex post facto

clause addresses.

7

when the offense was committed, through 1986, there was

8

real overcrowding, there was an overcrowding formula,

Justice Stevens, as you pointed out, in 1985 that made him

However, I think in this case in 1985,

10

98 percent -- the population cap was there at 98 percent,

11

and the overcrowding was there, and there were newspaper

12

articles coming out.

13

And the Governor in 1986, one month prior to the

14

time of the plea in this case, went into special session

15

and raised the trigger from 98 percent to 99 percent, so

there's maybe an objective reliance here on the part of

overcrowded, that's all right, but when we build the new

Is there any constitutional

problem with Florida doing that?

MR. REMLAND:

I don't -- Florida's done that,

which was passed in 1989 and got up and running in 1991.

reducing and changing the release date based upon changes

in population.

Some of which may accumulate under

MR. REMLAND:

The use of these statutes in

Florida since 1983 and the analysis of the way they've

been operating is that the gain time accumulates unless

MR. REMLAND:

And even the Florida supreme court

said they're basically the same.

20

for example, the Florida supreme court stated that the

1

2

Well, did it lump those together with

good behavior gain time?

MR. REMLAND:

The Florida supreme court has

between good behavior incentive gain time on the one hand

and overcrowding gain time on the other.

I believe --

Yes, but you don't get the

overcrowding gain time unless you also qualify for good

behavior, do you?
MR. REMLAND:

10

Absolutely, Justice Stevens.

As a

11

matter of fact, these credits, Justice Stevens, are

12

nothing more than good time credits during periods of

13

overcrowding, and as Arnold v. Cody out of the Tenth

was that it was unlikely that there would be really any

2

difference.

3

Here, it is clear there was a difference.

MR. THOMSON:

The overcrowding was not by

4

itself.

5

and you can look at the Florida statutes, and they looked

6

at who it was that was going to be released, what

7

classifications of people, and they said, certain classes

8

of people should not be released to the streets to take

9

care of an overcrowding problem.
This changed from time to time as overcrowding

10
11

Overcrowding resulted in the release of people,

became a greater or a less problem.
QUESTION:

12

But why isn't that a judgment that

13

one crime is more culpable or more dangerous than another,

14

and therefore more deserving of incarceration?

15

sounds like punishment to me.
MR. THOMSON:

16

That

Indirectly it has -- it makes a

17

judgment of who are more likely to cause a problem by

early release.

19

20

released.

There is no change of the sentence of

The sentence remains what it was.

22

the central rationales for punishment, and you're saying

QUESTION:

1

And that you're saying that

2

deterrence or prevention, I suppose, is the rationale

3

here.

4

MR. THOMSON:

You're not trying to prevent a

5

crime.

You are simply deciding if you are going to take

6

care of a problem called overcrowding -- I've got too many

7

people in the prisons and I don't have enough space, and

8

I've got to let a certain number of them on the streets.
Then I make judgments within that determination of who

10

should and should not be released consistent with my

11

obligation as a legislator to best protect public safety.

12

QUESTION:

Well, may be that's a good argument

13

for a prospective law to that effect, but how does that

14

justify a retrospective law that affects people who've

15

already been awarded credits and are out?

16

MR. THOMSON:

Insofar as the ex post facto

17

clause goes, it seems to me that it is not -- the ex post

18

facto clause is not involved because we are going to go

1

and take a look back at 1 85.

20

There may be other constitutional issues.

22

problems that may exist, but it is not an ex post facto

there any -- any law, outside of the confines -- confines

it literally it sounded as if you have 1,000 people in the

they're really only 10 years, and then -- after you
eliminate all the regular gain time they're there for 10

years.
And then what you do is, you look through the

12

whole 1,000, you give each of these 1,000 people 30 days

off their sentence, which will do nothing for prison

accumulated.
MR. THOMSON:

12

That's 276.

That's what I'm talking about.

Well, the second one, the one I've

just mentioned, administrative gain time, said up to 60

administrator, referred to the Governor, the Governor

assented, it came back, and the Secretary allocated days

them to the block of people that were in the eligible

MR. THOMSON:

That is correct, because the

alternative was that each day you had an overcrowding

problem you would recalculate, and that seemed to be, one

6

would say, a little bit a waste of time, so you -- as long

7

as you had a consistent overcrowding problem, once you

assigned credits to a person they were just left there.

9

QUESTION:

What do you mean when you use the

10

expression, booked, Mr. Thomson?

11

MR. THOMSON:

I mean that they were entered in

12

his record, and that continued until 1989, the fourth

13

effort, which is called controlled release in Florida, in

14

which, starting as of January of '91, these matters of

15

overcrowding were assigned to the - - a controlled release

16

authority, which is really the Parole Commission under

17

another name, and there is no booking with respect to

18

those credits at any time for Mr. Lynce because they were

19

handled differently, and that's the method of dealing with

20

overcrowding that started in 1991 and terminated finally

21

in 1994, when the last overcrowding release occurred in

22

the State of Florida.

QUESTION:

Mr. Thomson, your argument, or at
