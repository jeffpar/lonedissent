We'll hear argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. S. RADFORD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. RADFORD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about an ordinary property owner

12

who's been denied all beneficial use of her land and then,

13

in addition, has been denied access to the courts to seek

14

relief for that categorical taking of her property.

15

QUESTION:

Well, at the outset, I -- and maybe

16

you can answer this question very easily.

I don't know

17

why you didn't bring an inverse suit here, number 1, as a

18

matter of choice.

19

do so under Williamson as a matter of law, unless it's

20

peculiar to TRPA.

you against the bi-State agency?

22

MR. RADFORD:

I don't know why you're not required to

There's no inverse action available to

Well, the Tahoe Regional Planning

23

Agency, of course, is a bi-State body operating under an

24

act of Congress, and the type of proceeding that was

25

initiated here in district court would appear to be

specifically authorized under the TRPA compact.
QUESTION:

the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency?

4
5

Can you bring an inverse suit against

MR. RADFORD:

Well, I'm afraid that I can't

answer that question, Justice Kennedy.
QUESTION:

6

But don't you have to answer it under

7

Williamson?

Williamson says that that's what you must do.

8

Maybe -- is it because the agency has no treasury, I

9

guess, to pay the judgment, or -MR. RADFORD:

0

Does your -- is the thrust of your

11

question going to the second prong of Williamson County

12

regarding the need to pursue State remedies?
QUESTION:

3

Yes, and these aren't State remedies

4

because it's a bi-State agency, but it still seems to me

5

that to put the case into focus you should go to inverse

6

condemnation first and then

8
9

MR. RADFORD:

983 if there's no inverse

Well, the position of the Tahoe

Regional Planning Agency is that they do not have the

20

power of eminent domain, they do not have provisions for

21

paying just compensation, and this entered into the

22

decision that was made at the initial level of this

23

litigation to proceed by way of Federal --

QUESTION:

Thank you.

And so we might say that

generally we do not know that there are routinely inverse

certainly not routinely, Justice Kennedy.

QUESTION:

Thank you.

7

QUESTION:

Does the charter of the agency give

8

them eminent domain power?
MR. RADFORD:

9

No,

it does not, Justice Scalia.

I'd like to make two points here this morning,

10
11

if I could.

12

credits for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is not a

13

remaining use of Mrs. Suitum's land that could constitute

14

a ripeness bar to her regulatory takings claim.

15

First, the opportunity to sell development

Second,

the monetary value of those credits,

16

which was the sole issue in dispute in the proceedings

17

below, has no relevance to the ripeness of her claim,

18

in any case is eminently fit for adjudication using

19

ordinary appraisal methods.
QUESTION:

20
21

whether there's a taking,
MR. RADFORD:

22
23

true, Justice O'Connor.

But it might have relevance as to

I don't believe that would be

and

1

MR. RADFORD:

Justice O'Connor, I think that the

2

Solicitor General made a -- an extremely important

3

distinction in the brief that was filed with this Court.

4

I believe on page 17 the distinction was between value and

5

rights that were retained in Mrs. Suitum's property

6

following the application of these regulations and value

7

or rights that were obtained from the agency after the

8

complete deprivation of her ownership rights.

9

The value of the TDR's -- and we're going to use

10

shorthand here.

11

development rights, we're talking about these credits that

12

the agency has created.

13

When we talk about TDR's, transferable

Their value, if any, is something that has been

14

injected from the outside after all of Mrs. Suitum's

15

development rights have been destroyed.

16

that she has obtained from the agency, not values that

17

were retained by her property and, of course, when you

18

look at it that way, and the reason that distinction I

19

think is valuable is it illustrates that what TRPA is

20

really doing here --

21

QUESTION:

Well, how were the TDR's obtained in

22

Penn Central?

23

transferable development rights.

24

MR. RADFORD:

25

Those are values

I mean, we at least dealt in that case with

4

QUESTION:

The Court went directly

But apparently they were considered

of relevance in deciding whether there was a taking.

5

MR. RADFORD:

That -- that would appear to be

6

correct.

7

TDR's that were at issue in Penn Central were preexisting.

8

They were not created by the landmarks law that was being

9

challenged in Penn Central.

10
11

12

The direct answer to your prior question is, the

QUESTION:

They existed when the owner bought

the property in question and later sued on it?
MR. RADFORD:

I could not tell you exactly when

13

Penn Central purchased the property involved and when the

14

New York City zoning ordinance went into effect, but the

15

TDR's were part of the general zoning ordinance.

16

QUESTION:

But in any event, when Mrs. Suitum

17

bought her property the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency was

18

not yet in existence and hadn't developed the TDR?

19

MR. RADFORD:

The agency was in existence at the

20

time Mrs. Suitum acquired this property in 1972.

21

the credits that are at issue here were only created under

22

the 1987 plan that came along, of course, considerably

23

after Mrs. Suitum and her husband had acquired this lot

24

with the expectation of being able to build a home.

25

However,

Now, there is some residual value to

the extent the property might want to be acquired by a

2

neighbor or someone else to have a larger yard or

3

additional property, I assume.

4

MR. RADFORD:

QUESTION:

6

There is some value, apparently,

remaining for that purpose.
MR. RADFORD:

We don't know how much.

I would disagree with that,

MR. RADFORD:

QUESTION:

12

MR. RADFORD:

Well, I know --

A picnic table?
The situation that we have here is

13

an ordinary street with ordinary homes and one vacant lot

in the middle of it.

15

Sacramento.

It might be a suburb of Milwaukee or

It happens to be Incline Village.

Now, you have two houses, obviously, on each

16

side of that vacant lot, and the Ninth Circuit actually

says this.

want to buy that as an extension of their own land.

this property has some residual value?

go on.
MR. RADFORD:

2

Well -- however, if you look at

3

the evidentiary basis for that affidavit, there were no

4

comparable sales.

5

property -- that is, property that the agency has

6

designated a stream environment zone -- to an adjacent

7

landowner.

9

There has never been a sale of SEZ

Mr. Johnson's affidavit cited to six sales which
were an attachment to that affidavit, every one of which

10

was a sale by the State of Nevada.

11

an arm's length private transaction between the owner of

12

SEZ property and an adjacent property owner, and there's

13

no reason to believe there ever would be one.

14

QUESTION:

There has never been

Well, suppose we think in fact there

15

is some residual value in what's left for sale for some

16

purpose, obviously less than it would be if a house could

be built upon it.

the determination of whether there's a taking in the first

19

instance, and then possibly later, if there is a taking,

to the amount of money that should be paid?

21

If there is such a value, does it go to

MR. RADFORD:

It would presumably go to the

22

issue of viability for a taking, Justice O'Connor.

23

certainly would not go to the ripeness question.

MR. RADFORD:

2

QUESTION:

No.

They said that under Hamilton County

3

this was simply -- you had to pursue further remedies

4

before they would even confront the question.

5

MR. RADFORD:

6

QUESTION:

7

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

I thought it was your position that

it doesn't go to the taking either.

8

MR. RADFORD:

9

QUESTION:

Well --

That the criterion is not residual

10

value, but whether there is any economically beneficial

11

use of the land.

12

3
4

MR. RADFORD:

That, indeed, is our position,

Justice Scalia.
In response to Justice O'Connor's hypothetical,

5

what I was saying is, if this Court decides that there's

6

residual value in the property and decides that that has

7

some relevance to the takings question --

8
9
20

QUESTION:

Or decides that there may be.

We

don't need to make the factual determination.
MR. RADFORD:

That's correct.

I'm sorry if I

21

misrepresented your question, Justice O'Connor, but the

22

thrust of my answer was, if the Court winds up in the

23

position of saying this is not a complete wipe-out, this

24

isn't a Lucas-type deprivation of all beneficial use but

25

in fact is a Penn Central type analysis where we look at

we were to get to the merits, I think this is a Lucas

Do we have to say whether it's a

Lucas case or a Penn Central case in order for you to
prevail on the ripeness claim?

21

be they are not subject to the Administrative Procedure

22

Act which, of course, applied in the Abbott Laboratories

case that TRPA now seems to rest its ripeness claims on.

24

QUESTION:

Do I understand the reasoning of the

courts below that the lack of ripeness depended not only

1

on the fact that there had not been a final ruling from

2

the county in this -- with respect to one of these rights

3

that -- the lottery issue, I guess -- but that in fact

4

with respect to all of the TDR's collectively there was

5

simply too little known about their actual functioning to

6

assign a market value, and because a market value could

7

not be supplied, that was one of the reasons for saying

8

that the claim was not ripe.
MR. RADFORD:

9

Is that correct?

Justice Souter, that is the

10

interpretation that TRPA places on the decisions below.

11

don't read that myself.
In the proceedings below we had, of course, a

12

3

request -- or, actually an order from the district court

4

for a supplementary briefing on how the TDR process

5

worked.

6

submitted, and among the material that was submitted in

7

that process were affidavits valuing these very credits

8

that are at issue.

9

The supplemental briefs and affidavits were

Mrs. Suitum presented valuation evidence.

The

20

TRPA presented valuation evidence.

This was a factual

21

issue that was presented to the trial court to determine

22

in response to its order for supplemental briefing, and

23

yet presented with this evidence that both sides were

24

prepared to testify and present experts as to the

25

valuation of the credits, the court simultaneously held

I

1

that the credits have value, but there's no way of knowing

2

what that value is.

3

QUESTION:

I take it it's your position that

4

even if the value of the credits cannot be determined, you

5

are prepared to proceed in this suit and take whatever

6

consequences that fact might produce for you.

7

MR. RADFORD:

Justice Souter, the answer to that

8

would be yes.

Mrs. Suitum wants to build her house.

9

believes that she's entitled to realize her reasonable

She

10

expectations to proceed with the development of her

11

subdivision lot just as everyone else in the subdivision

12

has.
QUESTION:

13

And I take it you would say -- or

14

maybe you don't say.

15

these credits have no market value, or have no value that

16

can be established, that that in a sense aggravates the

17

taking that has occurred in your view.

18
19
20

MR. RADFORD:

I take it you would say that if

That would be correct, Justice

Kennedy.
Now, there seems to be a strange dilemma that's

21

presented by the rulings below, and that is clearly either

22

there is a market for the TDR's as the agency has

23

contended and many of its amici contend in their briefs to

24

this Court -- either there is a market for the TDR's in

25

which they are commonly bought and sold, in which case the
13

1

court could easily determine the value by appraisal, or

2

there is not a market for them, as the agency has

3

contended in other cases, and nobody knows what they're

4

worth.

5

obviously be completely unfair to force Mrs. Suitum to go

6

out and try to test a market that doesn't exist.

It's a total mystery.

7

In which case, it would

Significantly, I think, if we look at footnote

8

18 in the respondent's brief, the bottom line to all of

9

this is, regardless of whether Mrs. Suitum goes out and

10

goes through this process, tests the market, gets an

11

offer, comes back to the agency and applies for a sale of

12

these credits, it's the agency's position that the court

13

should still make up its own determination of what the

14

credits are worth.
So there's clear -- more than an implication.

15
16

The TRPA has clearly expressed its position that the

17

courts can determine the valuation issue completely

18

independently of anything Mrs. Suitum is required to do.

19

QUESTION:

If you're right, you have a very

20

strong argument that's final and definite.

21

say it's ripe, go decide the merits.

So then we'd

But when they get to the merits, what is the

22

23

situation?

That is, my impression is that they've been

24

through the merits in the court, that there's one

25

affidavit in there that says that these things are worth

something -- I don't know if it's $30,000 -- several

2

thousand dollars, and then there's another affidavit that

3

says no, they're not worth anything.

4

of the case, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

That was struck out

5

So if we send it back, what is there left to do?

6

MR. RADFORD:

Our basic position, Justice

7

Breyer, is that although the value of the credits can

8

easily be determined by the trial court, that in fact is

9

irrelevant to the taking issue, because what these

10
11
12

regulations have done -QUESTION:

So in other words you're going to

send it back and make a legal argument.

13

MR. RADFORD:

14

QUESTION:

That'S --

And the legal argument will be on the

15

basis of the record this constitutes a taking, and the

16

other side will say on the basis of the record it doesn't.

17

MR. RADFORD:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. RADFORD:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct --

Okay.
-- Your Honor.

But so far as this particular

21

proceeding this morning is concerned, I take it your

22

position is, even if you lose on the question whether the

23

TDR's are relevant to the taking, you are ready to

24

litigate them for whatever they are worth, and you just

25

want to proceed.

1

MR. RADFORD:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. RADFORD:

That's correct, Justice Souter.

Yes.
Now, I would have to add that this

4

is an extremely unusual case in that the substantive issue

5

of whether there has been a Lucas-type taking seems almost

6

to be contained within the procedural issue of whether the

7

case is ripe for adjudication.

8

9
10
11
12

This came up on ripeness.

The question

presented was ripeness, and by the normal procedures of
this Court, a ruling would be limited to ripeness.
QUESTION:

Well, the one is included in the

other only if the way that you resolve the first is by

3

resolving that these things have no value.

4

it that way, then indeed the Lucas question is answered,

5

but if you resolve it the other way, that they have some

6

value, then it's not the same question, is it?

7

MR. RADFORD:

If you resolve

Well, there's another way of

8

looking at it, Justice Scalia, and that is, the Ninth

9

Circuit held the case was not ripe because the opportunity

20
21

to sell these TDR's was a use of Mrs. Suitum's property.
If we're going to reverse the Ninth Circuit's

22

decision, then the conclusion could only be that the

23

opportunity to sell the TDR's is not a use of her

24

property --

25

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

It is what it is.

MR. RADFORD:
QUESTION:

What is there any need

There --

That is, why should we overrule a

11

holding, what looks like a holding in the Penn Central

12

case in order to decide a ripeness issue?

13

MR. RADFORD:

Oh, no, Justice Breyer.

I want to

14

make it perfectly clear that we are not suggesting this

15

Court should overrule Penn Central or, indeed, should

16

overrule any previous precedent.

17

Our position is the existing precedents of this

18

Court in Williamson County and the MacDonald case are

19

clearly consistent with a ruling that this case is ripe.

20

There's been a final adjudication not just

21

regarding the ability to utilize her land which was

22

involved in Williamson County and MacDonald, there's also

23

been a final determination, as you just said, regarding

24

what credits are available -- indeed, what credits she is

25

required to go out and market.

1

So there's been a final decision, the case is

2

ripe, that's as far as this case needs to go -- the Court

3

needs to go.

4

However, the Court could, without in any way

5

overruling Penn Central or any other case, take the

6

additional step of saying, since the ability to sell these

7

credits is not a use of her property, she has no

8

beneficial use of her property.

9

deprived her of all beneficial use.

The regulations have

10

Because everyone agrees -- the parties, and the

11

courts below -- everyone agrees that she has no remaining

12

use of her property except the ability to sell the TDR's.

13

QUESTION:

Suppose an agency said that you can't

14

use this lot, but we will give you your choice of one of

15

four other residential lots which appraisers would testify

16

are comparable.

17

Would that be a taking in your view?

MR. RADFORD:

I think that would be a taking,

18

Justice Kennedy, under the basic standard that all land is

19

unique, and to say we're going to take away the land that

20

you own in which your expectations are wrapped up and give

21

you another piece of land would in fact be a taking with

22

an offer of compensation.

23

Now, the property owner might accept that offer,

24

but they might also claim no, that doesn't comply with the

25

just compensation requirement.

Mr. Radford, do I understand you

correctly that you recognize that the only thing before us

conceded that there's been a final decision within the

In fact, that would seem to be virtually the

2

same as the final decision requirement in the specific

3

land use context of Williamson County.

4

What the agency is trying to do with Abbott

5

Laboratories is shoe-horn its argument in through the

6

second subsidiary issue of hardship on the parties and

7

yet, of course, the hardship inquiry in Abbott

8

Laboratories was not a balancing test, where we looked at

9

the hardship on the plaintiffs of having adjudication

10

delayed versus the hardship on the Government, whatever

11

that would mean, of having a prompt determination of the

12

legality of its regulations.
The hardship inquiry applied only to the

petitioners.

an injury, a further injury to the petitioner of having

MR. RADFORD:

QUESTION:

No.

I thought your point was that if

10

something is given to you at the same time as the taking,

11

it can be regarded as compensation, but it in no way

reduces the amount of the taking, and their response is,

13

yes, but you had more than just your ability to use the

We -- as this case has progressed our thinking

Abbott Labs principles, the prudential ripeness principles

1

They are challenging a ripeness ruling that will likely

2

help them, and they attack a TDR program that furthers

3

rather than undermines private property rights.

4

Petitioner offers two reasons why the lower

5

courts were wrong in concluding that her takings claim

6

lacks ripeness, a very narrow reason and a broad reason.

7

I would like to begin my argument by addressing first

8

petitioner's narrow argument, because I believe at least

9

that argument presents a close question.
Petitioner's narrow argument is that her takings

10

11

claim is ripe because the value of her TDR's can be

12

determined by a court based on appraisals without any

13

effort necessary by her to market them or to seek any

14

possible approval of the transfer.

15

QUESTION:

Well, and that sounds eminently

16

reasonable in light of the evidence that we do have in

17

front of us.

18

value.

19

Experts have given their opinion of the

MR. LAZARUS:

And we do agree, Your Honor, that

20

the appraisals that are in evidence are very good evidence

21

and they're weighty evidence, but the value of an actual

22

marketing effort for a TDR remains great, and let me

23

explain why.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but I don't see why that's a

requirement for ripeness.

1

MR. LAZARUS:

2

QUESTION:

Well

Maybe the best value of a property is

3

if it's sold, but we have many claims for takings where

4

the property isn't sold, and no court requires it to be

5

sold in order to determine the value.

6

MR. LAZARUS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LAZARUS:

9

That's right.

So it's a strange argument.
Well, Your Honor, this is a unique

case, because TDR's -- most real property, the value can

10

be readily determined based on appraisals.

11

fairly unique in this regard, which is what makes the

12

value for the fitness of the issue so important to

13

actually have a marketing effort.

14

just for a moment.

15

TDR's are

Let me try to explain

The single most dispositive factor in valuing

16

real property, as we all know, is location.

Well, TDR's

17

arise in the first instance out of ownership at one

18

location, but their efficiency and their effectiveness is

19

that they can ultimately be applied to many locations.

20

Until one starts to begin to identify where the market

21

exists for the TDR, it's very hard to know its value.
A TDR, for instance in Placer County if

QUESTION:

Well, but the TDR's in Penn Central

were different in that they went to property already owned

7

MR. LAZARUS:

They didn't have to.

These could

8

go to properties that were owned by Mrs. Suitum if she

9

owned them.

These TDR's are actually far more flexible

10

than the TDR's in Penn Central because they can go to

11

adjacent property, property she owns, or they can go to

12

lots of people in the --

13

QUESTION:

Well, you say they're more flexible,

14

but they also strike me as less usable, since at least the

15

person who owned the property that the TDR applied to

16

could make the judgment do I want to use it, rather than

17

just having to sell it to somebody.
It seems to me your argument is -- if the TRPA

19

says you can't use your lot but here's some scrip, you go

over to Harrah's and you can play roulette with it.

The fact that the Court considers

the TDR's in the Penn Central case relevant both to the

There are other things at stake

here.

One of the most important things of prudential

ripeness is the fitness of the issue for the court to

decide, and the court here simply wanted to decide this

very important as-applied takings case based on the better

9

evidence possible.
QUESTION:

10

The court -I can't think of any ripeness case

I've ever read, and maybe you can cite one, but I can't

uncertainty about these TDR's which prompted the lower

It seems to me that the agency's interest here

in raising the ripeness claim and in defending what has

reason for me to ascribe value to these rights that I'm

They don't want a

interest in a ruling which promotes the creation of this

market, but the real, more concrete interest of the agency

MR. LAZARUS:

1

Well, Your Honor, that is an

incidental, I think positive effect of our position, but I

think the main impetus of our position remains the fact

4

that it is in the Government's interest always to have the

5

constitutionality determined based on a fully fleshed-out

6

record.

7

Now, in this case, perhaps the trial court,

8

contrary to our recommendation, should have, relying on

our appraisals, ruled against the petitioner on the

10

merits.

11

that is far more generous than that which is in effect.

The irony is what she is challenging is a ruling

To the extent, Your Honor, that

there's been hardship here, under our view she could have

very easily made this case ripe consistent with the

Now, she is of course well within her rights to

appeal, but having chosen to appeal, you can't claim

hardship on the valuation based on the time that it took

for the appeal when the case could have been very easily

made ripe for other times.

5

I can't speculate as to why, given the age of

correctly, in the Williamson situation the rights which

the property owner wanted to exercise were rights which

came to the property owner with the purchase of the

property, but they were simply subject to a Government

limitation.

You can't do this unless you get a variance.

The rights that we're concerned with here,

however, are at least in part new rights.

just a moment, though, on petitioner's broader ripeness

the value of her TDR's is irrelevant as a matter of law as

is there?

ripeness is not what I was

There would not be -I thought that's what this case

involved.
MR. WALLACE:

Of course it does,

and I wanted to

14

get to that, but first we are quite concerned with the per

15

se takings theory under which they are arguing that it's

16

ripe, because it seems to us contrary to this Court's

17

jurisprudence, not only directly contrary to the holding

18

in Penn Central that TDR's count in the takings calculus

19

and are not just to be considered part of compensation,

20

but there's a reason for that holding that has to do with

21

the fact that the TDR's are part of the bundle of rights

22

that an owner of this parcel would get.

But the Court didn't treat Penn

MR. WALLACE:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. WALLACE:

Of course.

-- and said there was no taking.
Of course, and that is my point,

4

that the Court held there was no taking, and part of the

5

calculus was that the value of the TDR's was retained by

6

the owner, and was something that contributed to market

7

value remaining in that parcel of property.
Now, in approaching the ripeness question

8

9

itself, we have no enthusiasm generally for the

10

proposition that a plaintiff in a takings case who fails

11

to prove her case should get a second bite of the apple

12

and be able to bring a case later making essentially the

13

same claim if better evidence can be produced, so it was

14

with some hesitancy that we supported the ripeness

15

argument here on the respondent's side, and I think

16

that --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, let me understand what

18

you're just saying.

I don't know that any judge in this

19

case said that she didn't have a claim on the merits.

20

thought it was ripeness at both stages.

21

MR. WALLACE:

That is true.

I

The courts below

22

did not reach the merits, but the only evidence of value

23

that she offered was excluded, and so it seems to us that

24

the likely outcome if this case is held to be ripe is that

the respondent has introduced sufficient evidence of value

to the property at most would amount to what, $30,000 or

something?

MR. WALLACE:

Well, we have said that we think

there has been a final decision in this case within the

meaning of Williamson, and perhaps the role that we see

11

for Abbott Laboratories can best be hypothesized if at the

12

outset of this plan, when the TDR's were brand new and no

13

one had marketed any of them, every owner of one of these

properties went directly to court and there would be

nothing in the way of comparable sales, nothing but

speculation about what the value of the TDR's would be.

the right the agency itself created.

19

agencies can diminish ownership rights and diminish value

20

and then claim as a defense the fact that this can't be

21

appraised in court.

22

You're saying that

This is a very strange doctrine.

MR. WALLACE:

Well, this was an effort to

23

transform part of the bundle of rights in a way that would

24

retain a substantial measure of value in it.

here, the States that entered into the compact, Congress,

2

and the planning agency, recognized that because of the

3

basin's peculiar ecological fragilities, further

4

development on these parcels located in these sensitive

5

areas could not be permitted, that this would threaten the

6

interrelated environmental and economic well-being of the

7

entire basin.
And so they tried to create a program that would

8

9

retain a substantial measure of value for the owners of

10

these parcels, and mitigate any loss that they would

11

suffer as a result of what was not an extraneous

12

restriction being placed on them but something very much

13

related to the danger that their development would pose

14

within Dolan v. Tigard.

Mr. Chief Justice, unless there

are further questions from the Court I have nothing to

add.
