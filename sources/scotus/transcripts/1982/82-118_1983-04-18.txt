CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Solter, I think you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE D. SOLTER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

We will hear arguments first

MR. SOLTER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:
The real issue in this case is whether a blanket

11

application of equitable tolling by the application of a blanket

12

equitable tolling the defendant should be subjected to a second

13

wave of separate, individual lawsuits by putative members of the

14

class after the denial of class certification.

15

The Fourth Circuit's decision not only permits this, bui;

16

also makes it possible for such individuals to file their com­

17

plaints as class actions, thus beginning the tolling cycle once again .

18

We respectfully submit that the Fourth Circuit rule

19

announced in this case is not supported by case law, is an intru­

20

sion upon legislative prerogative and is inconsistent with

21

legislative purpose in establishing time requirements for filing.

22

It violates the integrity of Rule 23, expands rather than limits

23

litigation arising out of class actions, and overlooks the juris­

24

dictional aspect of the 90-day period prescribed in Title VII.

25

We further submit that there are no facts in this
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

case which warrant equitable tolling for the individual

2

respondent and there is no basis in fact in this case or in

3

law for the adoption of the broad rule extending the tolling

4

of American Pipe versus Utah to individual private actions

5

after class certification has been denied.

6

Now, on the surface, it might appear that there is

7

little difference between intervention as prescribed by

8

American Pipe and a separate, individual lawsuit after class

9

certification has been denied.

10

In order to examine the difference and illustrate

11

the differences, it is necessary to see just what the Fourth

12

Circuit tolling rule does by extending it to the private

13

individual action.

14

District Court, entitled a "Class Action," and broadly

15

defining that class, this automatically will extend filing

16

requirements of federal and state statutes, thus impacting on

17

all types of class actions, not just the type we are dealing

18

with here in Title VII.

19

By the mere filing of a complaint in the

Secondly, and perhaps the most frightening part of

20

it is that it really has the effect of placing the tolling

21

power in the hands of lawyers and plaintiffs and not in the

22

hands of the courts and this is done by the use of a broad

23

class definition in the initial complaint, because in American

24

Pipe, the filing of a complaint is what tolls the statute.

25

It is illustrated by this case in the complaint
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

filed by the two alleged class members which the respondent

2

seeks to — seek the benefit from, define the class as this:

3

Black persons who have been, continue to be, or may in the

4

future will be denied equal employment opportunities by the

5

defendant.

6

hired to infinity.

7

That is from the first such person that was ever
There is no limitation in that definition

as to time, as to the location.

It wasn't restricted to the

8

Baltimore plant and this company has plants in 26 states of

9

the United States.

There is nothing to limit it by definition

10

as to the nature of the discrimination or any other circumstance.

11

It simply refers to this gigantic class of persons in a very

12

general sense.

13

Now, this danger was recognized in the concurring

14

opinion in American Pipe where it was warned that it should

15

not be interpreted as an encouragement to lawyers to frame

16

overly broad issues — I mean, overly broad definitions to

17

attract members.

18
19

We also feel finally that it is totally inconsistent
with the purpose of the 90-day notice in Title VII.

In that

20

notice, under the law, actual service of the notice upon the

21

complainant after EEOC waives its jurisdiction is mandated.

22

The time does not begin to run until he actually has possession

23

of that notice and that notice, as is shown in the Appendix,

24

is extremely explicit.

25

to know about in the sense of when statutes start to run or

There are

no exceptions carved out in the statute

4

for any other different period or any changing of that period

5

and it seems extremely explicit even though this is a remedial

6

statute and we all recognize the rule of liberal construction

7

when we are referring to remedial statutes.

8
9

. The important relevant facts in this case to remember
are simply these:

That the respondent, after having timely

10

filed his complaint with the EEOC, sat back as he had to to

11

await the result.

12

gentlemen from Crown, who were black employees who had been

13

terminated, filed a class action known as Pendleton and Allen,

14

and they used the broad definition which is have just referred

15

to.

16

months later the EEOC issued its no reasonable cause to believe

17

that discrimination had occurred and the 90-day notice to sue.

18

Mr. Parker did nothing.

19

and finally the District Court, after hearing and after a

20

period of holding the matter sub curia, decided that class

21

certification should be denied.

22

1980, within two months. Which was timely in the sense of the

23

90 days if there is, in fact, a tolling, Mr. Parker filed his

24

own private individual suit.

25

While that was being investigated, two other

Of course, he was met with a motion

here today.

Also, when he was met with the summary judgment motion,

4

three days later, he filed a motion to intervene in the Parker-

5

the remaining litigation.
Now, with those facts as the background, it is

12

particularly significant to us and we submit should be to the

13

Court that here the respondent had actual notice of the filing

14

time when he received his notice from the EEOC.

15

nothing to indicate that he relied on the existence of the

16

Pendleton-Alien class action, even though that is alleged in

17

the brief, because he went back to EEOC in 1980 and tried to

18

get another fresh 90-day notice of right to sue in order to

19

give substance to his new filing.

20

22

QUESTION:

There is

Of course —

Mr. Solter, do you think American Pipe

requires reliance at least to the putative interveners?
MR. SOLTER:

No, I don't.

I think that is one of

23

the things that is considered in the discussion; that the people

24

who do know about it are entitled to rely on it for the purposes

25

outlined in American Pipe, namely, to intevene.

In other words,

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

if they decide to stay out and they are aware of it, then

2

obviously they are relying on it and they come in to intervene.

3

QUESTION:

You say the very fact of their later

4

intervention shows they probably relied on the existence prior

5

to the refusal to certify?

6

MR. SOLTER:

If they knew of it, but, of course,

7

American Pipe extended to those inactive and unknown members

8

as well who might subsequently learn of the class action and

9

the fact that it was not certified and file in time.

It covered

10

all of the members, potential members, of the putative class

11

whether they had knowledge and relied or whether they gained

12

knowledge at a later time.

13

The respondent in this case did take advantage of

14

his right to intervene for purposes of appeal under United

15

Airlines versus McDonald and then, for one reason or another,

16

after having been given that right to intervene and file the

17

appeal, the appeal was not timely filed and that was the end

18

of that.

19

We submit that the Fourth Circuit has provided a

20

fifth alternative to a situation where the respondent, under

21

the scheme of Title VII, had already four alternatives.

22

could have filed timely if he wanted to go his own individual

23

way.

24

admitted having received it and having taken it to an attorney.

25

He had the notice, he could have filed timely.

He

He also admitted having gone back to EEOC after

He

receiving it for further explaination.

2

He could have moved to intervene in the Pendleton-

3

Alien case while class status was pending.

4

to intervene in a timely fashion after class certification was

5

denied, but he did not.

6

the denial of class certification, which he did, but, of course,

7

then lost that by failing to file in the Fourth Circuit a timely

8

appeal.

9

QUESTION:

He could have moved

And, he could have moved to appeal

There would be no point to your third

10

alternative, would there, to intervene in the class action after

11

denial of class certification?

12

MR. SOLTER:

Oh, yes, I think that is the whole point.

13

The reason for intervention that was prescribed in the American

14

Pipe case was to keep control over the litigation in the same

15

court, in the same district, rather than to allow the individuals

16

as they can now under this rule if it is adopted, to go out and

17

file their own private actions.

18

QUESTION:

Well, as I understood your fourth

19

alternative was to intervene in an appeal, appeal the denial.

20

Your third was simply to intervene after refusal to certify.

21

And, I am wondering, what is the point to that if you don't

22

plan to appeal?

23

MR. SOLTER:

Well, I got my numbers mixed up.

I

24

thought you were referring to the actual intervention in the

25

case before the appeal stage, while it was still viable to —

QUESTION:

2

MR. SOLTER:

3

QUESTION:

No, I meant after denial of certification.
What he did in this case you mean?
Yes.

Except I thought you were posing as

4

two separate alternatives intervention after refusal to certify

5

for purposes of appealing and simply intevention after refusal

6

to certify, apparently wanting to be in an uncertified class.

7

MR. SOLTER:

Well, I did mean to make that distinction,

8

because after denial of certification, he can — the statute

9

starts to run again under American Pipe and he is provided the

10

opportunity to then intervene provided he does it within the

11

time left to him on whatever statute it is.

12

alternative.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

So, that is one

Then when he does that he is simply sub­

mitting his individual claim on the merits really?
MR. SOLTER:

Precisely.

And, that is why I am arguing

16

that that is the route that should be followed and not to go

17

out with his private action and institute another case outside

18

of the framework of the class action which is really the whole

19

basis on which the American Pipe case was placed as I read it.

20

And, that was to effectuate the purposes of Rule 23, to protect

21

the class as a whole, inactive and uninformed as well as those

22

who relied, and to control the individual claims through Rule

23

24, the intervention route, rather than to have the independent

24

actions going on.

25

vention is so necessary.

And, here is where the reason for inter­
When someone tries to intervene in a
10

1

case of this kind after the denial, in order to intervene and

2

get the benefit of the tolling, they have to show that first

3

there really was a class of some kind and, secondly, that they

4

were a member of it in order to get the benefit of the tolling.

5

And that is where I think the District Court should have the

6

power to control rather than if an individual action is filed

7

and a motion for summary judgment filed on the basis of

8

limitations, to then hold another, almost a de novo hearing

9

to determine whether there was a potential class and whether this

10

man or woman was a member of that class.

11

The whole idea of American Pipe was to use Rule 23

12

to keep the litigation in some orderly fashion controlled so

13

that the matter could be managed in a proper way and a

14

practical way.

15

are for the district courts to follow and to help them in

16

implementing their court calendar.

17

that is why this point was made so firmly in American Pipe

18

where it said it was limited for the purposes of intervention.

19

And, after all, the decisions that are rendered

And, it seems to me that

Also, there is another question that is raised by

20

the language of American Pipe where tolling was limited at

21

least where the denial of class certification was solely for

22

the lack of numerosity.

23

case there was a class clearly established but there weren't

24

enough members to satisfy Rule 23 and, therefore, there was a

25

clear finding that joinder was practical and, therefore, the

The reason for that was that in that

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

next logical thing that follows is if joinder is practical,

2

then intervention is the next step.

3

Now, if certification was denied for lack of

4

typicality or commonality, there is a good chance there is no

5

class there at all underlying the action or at best it is a

6

very narrow class and, therefore, intervention, as opposed to

7

a private suit, provides the mechanism for screening out non-

8

meritorious claims.

9

in a fairly timely fashion, because members would have to act

10

promptly because their statute is running out, so that every­

11

thing is fresh, it is all in one place, and not scattered in

12

many districts perhaps where a defendant may have a different

13

plant so there would be venue there.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SOLTER:

16

QUESTION:

It keeps the litigation in the same court

Mr. Solter, may I ask you —
Yes, Your Honor.
— what do you do with the plaintiff,

17

prospective plaintiff who seeks to intervene not as a right

18

but intervention in the discretion of the trial judge and the

19

trial judge decides he won't allow intervention, not because

20

of time bar but just because he doesn't think it is an

21

appropriate case to — He doesn't want to complicate his own

22

lawsuit with this group of intervenors?

23

are also barred?

24
25

MR. SOLTER:

Would you say they

Well, I would say that if the judge

granted it on the grounds that you suggest, it might be an
12

1

abuse of discretion under the rule, but if he granted —

QUESTION:

MR. SOLTER:

QUESTION:

5

MR. SOLTER:

I am asking if he denied it.
If he denied it?
Yes.
If he denied intervention because he

6

felt that the individual had failed to estabish that he was

7

a member of a class or that there was such a class —

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, assume he was literally within the

class described by the plaintiff, but when it came around to

10

certifying the class, the judge decided

11

typicality reason for not certifying a class and then he also

12

decided not to allow intervention because he thought it would

13

delay the proceeding, allow too many people to come in.

14

do you do — How does your rule deal with that kind of a case?

15

MR. SOLTER:

the

commonality or

What

Well, the result, I think, would be

16

that, first of all, the person would be time barred because he

17

wouldn't be able to then claim the benefit of tolling.

18

I think he has — That would constitute a final order as far

19

as he is concerned and he would have a right of appeal.

QUESTION:

21

MR. SOLTER:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

But,

But that is his only right?
Sir?
The Fourth Circuit Rule would protect him

though as I understand it.
MR. SOLTER:

I don't think any more so necessarily

than the intervention rule would, because a defendant is going

1

to raise the limitations issue in one way or another, even in

2

the private action that the Fourt Circuit advocates.

3

words, you would still have to come in and file a motion for

4

summary judgment based on limitations and then there would have

5

to be, it seems to me, a hearing on this whole question of

6

class status for his to reach back and get the benefit of the

7

tolling.

the benefit of the tolling only if (a) there is a class, and

(b) he is a potential member of it.

So, I think you still

Well, I should think we would always have

13

a case in which the plaintiff would be within the description

14

of the class representative, within the class described in the

15

complaint, but not within the class the trial judge was willing

16

to certify.

17

and he is within the outer ring.

18

You have got kind of concentric circles almost

MR. SOLTER:

Well, that is true, of course, but the

19

purpose of the motion and hearing on certification is to narrow

20

it and try to determine what the real class —

21

QUESTION:

And, if he doesn't get within the class

22

that is actually certified, then he does not get the benefit

23

of the tolling rule?

24

MR. SOLTER:

25

QUESTION:

I would say that is correct, yes.
Mr. Solter, in the category that you are

3

plaints in anticipation that this problem might arise and

4

isn't that as burdensome or moreso than the protective motions

5

to intervene that the court was concerned about in American

6

Pipe?

7

MR. SOLTER:

Well, obviously there is the risk of

8

that being involved.

9

to anything greater by going the intervention route.

The question is whether it really amounts
After

10

all, if a potential member of the class thinks he is has got

11

a claim and he belongs in this class and he wants to intervene,

12

he has to make these showings.

13

it comes back to the question of control and management at the

14

trial level that really dictates the answer to the problem.

15

And, it just strikes me that

Now, the Second Circuit has ruled in the fashion

16

that tolling does not affect — That the member of the class

17

does not get the benefit of tolling to file a private action,

18

he only can intervene.

19

Also, the Ninth Circuit, where the American Pipe case

20

came from originally, has taken that view.

21

takes the other view and that, of course, is why we are here.

22

Now, under Rule 23, which this Court placed a great

The Fourth Circuit

23

deal of emphasis upon in the American Pipe case, it recognized

24

that back before the 1966 amendment, there were the spurious

25

type class actions which where unfair advantage could be

obtained by persons who wanted to sit on the sidelines and see

2

what happened and not be bound by any judgment.

3

this effect, Rule 23 was amended and it provided for process,

4

among other things, if there is certification, to identify

5

the members.

And, American Pipe recognized —

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. RAMSEY:
Court:

It is the respondent's position that the Fourth
Circuit's ruling is consistent with the purpose for the tolling
rule as announced in American Pipe.

First, I shall discuss the policy considerations.
The effect on Rule 23 if the Court were to limit the putative
class member to intervention into the cause action.

24
25

Second

would be the practical effect of limiting it to intervention.
Third would be the effects of the broad interpretation of the
tolling rule on Rule 23.

Fourth, the effect on the case at

bar, and fifth, the fact that the interpretation given to the
tolling rule by the Fourth Circuit is consistent with this
Court's dictum in Eisen and the fact that a broad interpretation
of the limitations rule on the statute,for purpose of statute
of limitations is also consistent with the tolling rule.

And,

finally, that the 90-day notice of right to sue is a statute
of limitations as opposed to a jurisdictional prerequisite.

22
23

Mr. Chief Justice and members of the

The policy reasons for the American Pipe tolling rule
is to prevent premature filings of motions to intervene into
the class action before the class certification issue has been
decided.

If the Court were to limit the putative class member
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to intervening into the existing cause of action, then that

2

would undermine the policy considerations of judicial economy

3

and efficiency.

4

unmanageable by the filing of numerous separate lawsuits in

5

different jurisdictions and numerous and multiple motions to

6

intervene into the class before the class certification issue

7

has been decided.

8
9

It might make the purported class action

Moreover, the Court should pay close attention to
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24A and Rule 24B in this case.

10

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24A gives the intervenor a

11

right to intervene, whereas, Rule 24B allows the court to

12

exercise its discretion as to whether or not the putative class

13

member would be able to intervene into the cause of action.

14

Knowing this, any smart lawyer or smart putative

15

class member would move to intervene on a timely basis prior

16

to the motion for class certification being denied and again

17

thus undermining the purpose of the tolling rule.

18

The practical considerations for requiring inter­

19

vention only would have — A decision to require intervention

20

only would have as a practical matter an adverse impact on

QUESTION:

Thus, again, this would serve to

Mr. Ramsey, as a practical matter, can

5

you say, based on your experience, how much discovery usually

6

takes place in a typical class action case before the class

7

certification motion is ruled upon?

8

MR. RAMSEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

A significant amount

9

of discovery generally occurs in that in cases of this nature,

to

such as Title VII class actions, the motion is due and decided

11

on statistical evidence as to whether or not there is a pattern

12

and/or practice of discrimination that has been practiced against

13

a class.

14

In addition, the class plaintiff may have also

15

attempted to discover evidence concerning disparate treatment

16

of class members.

17

And, in fact, in the case at “bar:,, after the class

18

certification issue had been decided, there was a dispute as

19

to whether or not the main plaintiffs in the class action would

20

be allowed to go into the employer's personnel files for

21

purposes of discovering evidence concerning disparate treatment.

22

If the District Court had made an adverse decision

23

to the class plaintiffs and denied them the right to seek that

24

evidence, then the Respondent Parker, having intervened at that

25

state in the litigation,he would have been deprived of evidence

to carry his burden of proof on the merits.

QUESTION:

Mr. Ramsey, that also would have been true

if they had certified the class, isn't it?

been stuck with the developments in that lawsuit.

MR. RAMSEY:

Well, if the Court had certified a class,

the —

QUESTION:

8

MR. RAMSEY:

They would have

And then denied discovery.
And then denied discovery, then they

would have been faced with that problem, although we believe

10

the District Court would have been wrong in that Eisen versus

11

Carlisle & Jacquelin teaches that the court should not go into

12

the merits when determining whether or not a case should be

13

certified as a class action.

14

QUESTION:

No,, but it seems to me you are arguing

15

it is unfair to make the non-party accept the bad features of

16

the litigation, but unless he files his own lawsuit, he is

17

going to do that if the class is eventually certified.

18

in effect, seems to be content with the class until the

19

certification ruling is adverse.

20

MR. RAMSEY:

He,

Well, at that point, he may be able to

21

move to intervene pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

22

24A on the grounds of inadequacy of representation in that

23

the main plaintiffs would not have sought sufficient discovery

24

to have the case determined on its merits.

25

QUESTION:

It just seems to me there is a little
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

inconsistency in your position.

2

MR. RAMSEY:

I may not get it entirely.

Well, further, the other practical effects

3

on the case would be that requiring a putative class member

4

to intervene into an existing cause of action may not be

5

financially feasible in that should the court have before it

6

a nationwide class action individuals located in jurisdictions

7

far from the original jurisdiction may not be able to

8

financially afford to hire attorneys and litigate in a foreign

9

jurisdiction.

10

Moreover, if there was a nationwide class action,

11

then the individuals, by being required to file to intervene,

12

may be required to litigate in a jurisdiction in which witnesses,

13

documents, and other factors related to this litigation would

14

not be present in a foreign jurisdiction.

For example, an

And, thus —

QUESTION:

Mr. Ramsey, is it customary where motions

20

to intervene in a class action have been filed and intervention

21

has been granted that each of the intervenors keeps their own

22

attorney who made the motion to intervene on their behalf?

23

MR. RAMSEY:

I believe that is discretionary with

24

the court.

25

several intervenors or it may allow the intervenor to keep his

The court may appoint lead counsel where there are

1

2

the intervenor to keep his own counsel, although there would

3

be lead counsel for purposes of carrying out the major phases

4

of the litigation.

In all instances, the court would probably allow

5

Now, after ;ithe class certification issue has been

6

denied, then, of course, there is no longer any interest in

7

protecting judicial economy and efficiency, because the purpose

8

of that rule in the first place was to disencourage premature

9

motions to intervene into the class action and the filing of

10

separate lawsuits.

11

Of course, once the court decides adversely to the

12

class; that is that there should not be a class certification,

13

then Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24B comes into place.

14

That rule allows discretionary intervention.

15

And, should this Court limit the putative class

16

members to intervening into the existing cause of action, then

17

it is possible that the putative class member could lose his

18

lawsuit on the grounds unrelated to the merits of his cause of

19

action.

20

to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24B was untimely, that it

21

may cause undue delay in the original cause of action, and,

22

thus, deny the putative class member the right to intervene,

23

and, thus, his day in court.

24
25

That is the Court could decide that the motion pursuant

As a practical matter, deciding that the American
Pipe tolling rule should be given a broad interpretation and
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

allow separate lawsuits or intervention would not undermine

2

the purpose of Rule 23.

3

Should separate lawsuits be filed, then the court,

4

pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42A could consoli­

5

date all like and related causes of action for purposes of

6

pre-trial litigation, for purposes of trial, or he may pass —

7

the court may pass any other orders it deems necessary to

8

effect judicial economy and efficiency.

9

Should there be several lawsuits filed in separate

10

jurisdictions, then the court on motion by any party, the

11

employer as well as the intervenors, may coordinate the

12

litigation through the multi-district litigation panel, and,

13

thus, conduct all pre-trial proceedings so that there will not

14

be unnecessary burdens and expenses on the employers, the

15

court, or the litigants.

16

the litigation has been completed, the panel of multi-district

17

litigation then can remand the case back to the particular

18

jurisdiction in which the lawsuit was originally filed for

19

trial.

20

And, once the pre-trial phases of

22

charge of discrimination with EEOC which then put the petitioner

23

on notice as to the claim of the respondent, that he was

24

complaining that there was discrimination against him on the

25

basis of his race.

This is said because the respondent here filed a

And, indeed, as counsel pointed out, there
23

was an investigation conducted by the Maryland Commission on

2

Human Relations and EEOC finding no probable cause in which the

3

employer participated.

4

Second, as the District Court opinion points out, the

5

respondent here was a member of the putative class and the

6

petitioner had been placed on notice as to the type of claims

7

that the respondent had.

8

by discovery and members of the putative class had been named in

9

the record so they actually knew the identity of each putative

In fact, the class had been shaped

class member.
Moreover, once the respondent had filed his own law­

12

suit, he moved to consolidate his lawsuit with the case that

13

had been filed as a class action.

14

To say that the difference between intervention and

15

consolidation is to — It would be to exhalt form over substance

16

by saying that consolidation and intervention would be different.

17

QUESTION:

Was there any particular reason that you

18

chose on behalf of your client to file separately and then

19

move to consolidate rather than to intervene?

20

MR. RAMSEY:

The reasons were because being experienced

21

with that litigation and being counsel in both cases, I was

22

aware of the pre-trial discovery and difficulties that had

23

gone on in that particular case and not wanting my client to be

24

bound by those difficulties, then I opted to file a separate

25

lawsuit and then move to consolidate those lawsuits based on my
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

experience in other cases where class actions had been filed

2

and separate lawsuits had been filed and the District Court

3

allowed the separate lawsuit to engage in his own discovery, to

4

complete his own discovery for purposes of trial.

5

So, there was a practical reason for doing that.

6

The respondent submits that the Fourth Circuit's

7

interpretation of American Pipe to allow the filing of a

8

separate lawsuit is consistent with this Court's dictum in

9

Eisen versus Carlisle & Jacquelin.

There the Court rejected

10

the argument that class members would not opt out of a class

11

action because the limitations period would have run, citing

12

American Pipe.

13

We believe that the only fair reading of that dictum

14

is that a class member would opt out for purposes of filing a

15

separate lawsuit since a putative class member would not opt

16

out of a class only to move to intervene into that same lawsuit

17

again.

18

Furthermore, we believe that the tolling of the

19

statute of limitations for purposes of separate lawsuits or

20

intervention is consistent with the purposes of the statute of

21

limitations.

22

promote justice by preventing unfair surprise through the

23

recovery of stale claims that have been allowed to slumber

24

until evidence has been lost, memories faded, or witnesses

25

disappeared.

The purpose of a statute of limitation is to

2

it is encumbent upon the defendant or employer to retain its

records and documents.

4

defendant to prepare its case for trial and retain the necessary

5

evidence.

6

would not be undermined by such a tolling rule.

7

It is encumbent upon the employer or

Therefore, the purpose of a statute of limitations

Finally, the defendants — the petitioner argues that

8

the 90-day period for bringing a lawsuit is a jurisdictional

9

prerequisite as opposed to the statute of limitations.

The

10

respondent submits that this Court in Zipes versus Trans World

11

Airlines has addressed that issue to a large extent.

12

out in that decision that the limitation periods under Title VII

13

have always been referred to by this Court as statutes of

14

limitations subject to waiver, estoppel, and tolling.

15

It pointed

Moreover, a reading of 42 USC § 2000e-5(f) (3), the

16

Jurisdictional Section of Title VII, does not mention the 90-

17

day limitations period.

18

It would seem that the defendant or the petitioner

19

concedes that this case involves a statute of limitations as

20

opposed to a jurisdictional prerequisite in that it admits

21

that American Pipe applies and if American Pipe applies, then

22

there was a tolling of the statute of limitations during the

23

pendency of the class action.

24
25

In conclusion, the respondent submits that a broad
interpretation of the American Pipe rule to allow separate

lawsuits or intervention is consistent with Rule 23; that is

would undermine the purpose of the tolling rule and encourage
the filing of pre-certification motions to intervene and separate
lawsuits should this Court decide otherwise.

Thank you.

We submit that it

Very briefly, it seems that the respondent argues
that equitable tolling should be looked upon as some sort of
a right.

This Court and all courts look upon equitable tolling

as something that is given only sparingly, almost on a case-by­
case basis, and it wasn't until, I believe, the American Pipe
case that a blanket exercise of judicial or equitable tolling
was granted so that it covered many, many people.
I think that what we have to look at here is that
the equitable tolling of American Pipe came about because the

22

Court was anxious to maintain the integrity of Rule 23 and

23

that it saw that if tolling was not given in that situation

24

many people would be harmed and would not have an opportunity

25

to even move to intervene to determine whether they were class
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

members who were entitled to assert a private action after the

2

denial of class certification.

3

We say that if a putative member of the class wants

4

the benefit of that tolling, he must bear the burden of that

5

tolling by showing through intervention in an orderly, manage­

6

able fashion before the same court that he is a member of that

7

class and that the class existed.

8

that if you adopt the Fourth Circuit rule, you simply open

the door for an entire new round or wave of litigation in

Otherwise, it seems to me

time, the intervenor is adequately protected by the technique

12

that is available to him under Rule 24 where he can come before

13

this Court, the District Court, and assert his right to inter­

vene in that action.

At the same

We simply feel that this — The whole purpose of

the American Pipe tolling rule through intervention was to

keep the power to control and direct class litigation in the

courts and not in the hands of opportunistic lawyers and
