ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK SUSMAN

ON BEHALF OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD ASSOCIATION OF MISSOURI

11

MR. SUSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are here today on a case that the Eighth

12

Circuit decided exactly one year ago today.

13

Restrictions in question here, like all legislative

14

abortion restrictions, adversely and disproportionately

15

affect minors and indigent women who frequently lack the

16

maturity, education, sophistication and financial

17

resources to overcome the additional legislative hurdles

18

placed in front of them while seeking to exercise some

19

reasonable control over their reproductive functions.

20

There are basically only four of the

21

restrictions at issue here today before this Court.

22

There were many others decided by the district court,

23

and some of those were not appealed to the court of

24

appeals; there were others that were appealed to the

25

court of appeals and ware not further appealed to this

ourt
Those four issues involve minors, the

3

in-hospital provision after 12 weeks, the requirement of

4

two doctors being in attendance when an abortion is

5

performed on a viable fetus, and lastly, a requirement

6

that pathology be done by a certified pathologist on all

7

specimens regardless of the length of pregnancy.

8

Before addressing those four issues, though, I

9

would be remiss if I did not respond in part to the

10

argument and to the brief of the Solicitor General,

11

which brief was jointly filed in this case as well as in

12

the Akron case, although his argument was solely taken

13

during the time of the Akron matter.

14

It seems that his brief — and as supported by

15

his oral argument and he so states on page 3 of that

16

brief — that the primary underpinning of his argument

17

is, and I quote, "that the legislature has superior

18

factfinding capabilities."

19

that that is absolutely not true; that at best, it is

20

fallacious and at worst it is probably naive.

21

I would submit to this Court

Initially, at least certainly in fSissouri and

22

with all other state legislatures with which I am

23

familiar, the assignment as to which committee any

24

particular piece of legislation goes has a lot to do

25

with whether those in power in that particular

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

legislative body desire that piece of legislation to

2

pass or to fail.

3

And secondly, the factfinding that goes on, if

4

any, — and very little goes on in Missouri, and I have

5

attended many of these legislative findings in these

6

various pieces of legislation, not only in this case but

7

in the Danforth case -- they are not open hearings, they

8

are not hearings that invite an unbiased, an impartial

9

and a fair hearing of evidence.

Frequently, speakers

10

only on one side of the issue are asked to attend, and

11

there certainly is no great factfinding ability that

12

would be superior to the type of hearing that goes on in

13

court.

14

hearing, that went on in this case.

15

Particularly the type of open hearing, unbiased

As the Court is aware in this case, it was not

16

just one, but there were two district court trials

17

because certain issues the appellant court felt, and

18

particularly in regard to the in-hospital issue, had not

19

been fully decided as to the necessary facts that needed

20

to be resolved, so said the Eighth Circuit, and so it

21

was remanded to the district court for a second trial.

22

In addition, I would suggest the bootstrap

23

argument also suggested by the Solicitor General that

24

appears on page 9 of his brief, that legislatures fully

25

take into account all of the constitutional implications

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of those enactments which they pass judgment on because

2

of the fact that they all take an oath to uphold the

3

Constitution, which we are here today discussing, is

4

awe some.

MR. SUSMAN:

That's correct.
Why is that so startling to you?
It is not startling, but I do not

10

feel that they accurately do it.

11

these cases would not be here today.
QUESTION:

If, in fact, they did,

generalizations which has the value of many

HR, SDSHANs

2

No, I think he’s being faithful

3

to the oath if he intentionally tries to apply it to the

4

best of his or her ability.
I think the suggestion of heavy deference to

5
6

the legislative judgment on policy issues, which is

7

suggested very strongly by the Solicitor General — and

8

in those cases that he suggests of different segments of

9

society have strongly competing views is a terrifying

10

thought.
The entire concept of fundamental basic rights

11
12

is sought to be undermined and discarded in one fell

13

swoop.

14

lobbying interests in the legislature, and woe be it to

15

the minority who seek to rely on basic equality, justice

16

and decency for their protection.

17

Constitutional rights will then be bargained by

A comment by Justice Blackmun, as to whether

18

or not Roe versus Wade or TCarbury versus Madison was

19

being sought to be overruled I think is apropos.

20

is to adopt the suggestions of the Solicitor General,

21

179 years of constitutional history would appear to fly

22

out the door.

23

If one

I would suggest lastly in this regard that the

24

government's somewhat simplistic suggestion of how to

25

resolve this matter and how to avoid any further

abortion cases coming before this Court creates more

2

problems than it purports to solve.

3

eliminate the entire concept, in my opinion, of

4

fundamental rights.

It basically would

5

The first issue that I would wish to address

6

in our chapter, in our section that was passed, is the

7

issue of the minors.

8

particular argument by noting that with two possible

9

exceptions, it is a question of statutory construction.

I would somewhat simplify this

10

Those two exceptions would be whether or not this act

11

does require or insure that appellate review be swift

12

a nd com pie te .

13

Respondents take the position that since this

14

statute was enjoined the day following its enactment,

15

the day following it went into law, since it has never

16

been in practice in the state of Missouri, that the

17

Supreme Court of the state of Missouri has waited to

18

enact any rules covering appellate review in these cases.

19

I don't know and would not speak to the reason

20

they have waited.

21

since the statute has been on the books that no rules

22

have been adopted.

23

statute has never been in effect to this date.

24
25

It is clear that in the three years

But again, in all candor, the

The second exception that I would raise in
addition to the statutory construction problem on this

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

issue of the minors is that the statute makes absolutely

2

no exceptions whatsoever for any emergency of any kind,

3

even when life or health is threatened.

4

possible scenarios, it is necessary that the minor, if

5

she cannot obtain the permission of one parent, go to

6

the juvenile court and go through this hearing and any

7

subsequent appeals that might come along the way, and

8

receive the court's sanction for this procedure,

9

regardless of the fact that her life or health is

Under all

10

immediately being threatened by the fact that the doctor

11

cannot perform the abortion.
And yet, it is interesting to note that

12

13

Section 3 of this same statute makes an exception of

14

this very like kind when it is necessary to perform an

15

abortion against the minor's will.

16

abortion is necessary to save the life of the minor, and

17

she doesn't want it and she says no, then the doctor may

18

proceed.

19

abortion and her life or health is threatened, he cannot

20

proceed until he receives, again, the sanction of either

21

one parent or the court.

22

But not the reverse.

It says if an

1

interpretation of that statute was clear, that the use

2

of this conjunctive word "or" between the options

3

available to the juvenile court of a, b or c, the court

4

had the option to pick any of those, and not necessarily

5

in any order and not necessarily by rejecting others

6

first.
The appellate court disagreed.

7

It came to an

8

opposite conclusion.

We have suggested in our Reply

9

Brief recently filed with this Court that in light of

10

the difference of opinions of reasonable judicial minds,

11

that perhaps this Court should abstain from the issue

12

inasmuch as a decision by the Missouri state courts'

13

would, in fact, or could possibly resolve any federal

14

constitutional question as to what, in fact, the statute

15

does mean.

16

There has never been an opportunity for the

17

Missouri state courts to rule on this issue, and perhaps

18

abstention is appropriate.

19

type of situation, was the route taken by this Court in

20

1976 in Bellotti 1, and that position of abstaining in

21

that kind of an issue was recently affirmed in H.L.

22

versus Matheson in referencing Bellotti 1.

Abstention, in an identical

The second matter that we would address is the

24

in-hospital provision.

This provision probably has the

25

most serious impact upon the actual delivery of abortion

Themopolous case, it is the practice of this Court to

9

take the factual findings of the lower courts as they

10
11

find them.
This case is unique in regard to the

12

in-hospital provision, as opposed to any of the other

13

district courts that have decided this issue, and there

14

have been many.

15

District Court in Louisiana, in Kentucky, in Missouri

16

17

weeks, by courts in Illinois and Wisconsin.

18

19

This issue has been decided by the

All have

There were two separate district court trials

20

on this issue, as I indicated.

And in fact, the trial

21

on remand, the second district court trial, -- and it

22

was specifically remanded for this particular issue

23

because the appellate court said, we want to know

24

specifically whether or not it is safer to perform

25

second trimester procedures in a hospital or in an

outpatient facility.

And while the district court had

2

held the section unconstitutional, they had not in so

3

many words made that factual finding.

4

And when it was sent back on remand and the

5

second trial was held, respondents chose not to offer

6

any testimony whatsoever.

7

witnesses at the trial on remand were those offered by

8

the petitioner.

trimester abortion technique currently available.

found that second trimester D6E procedures are currently

performed in only one hospital in the entire state of

Missouri, that being in Kansas City, Missouri which is

on the western border.

MR. SUSMAN*

These are all in the Joint

Appendix on pages 12 through 14 — actually, 12 through

22

14, and then the same findings by the appellate court,

23

or additional findings, are found on the Cross-Petition

24

at A6 1 and A 116 .

25

The district court went on to find that in the

1

last final year, when only hospitals could perform

2

abortions in Missouri -- that being 1979 — that 540

3

second trimester DGE procedures were performed.

4

district court ruled on this issue in January of 1980

5

and so it's fair to compare the year of 1980, if you

6

want to count it as a whole year, in which procedures

7

were available both in the hospital and both outpatient.

8
9

The

The court found, as opposed to the 540
performed in a hospital when it could only be performed

10

in a hospital in 1979, that in 1980 there were some 1400

11

second trimester procedures, 700 of which were performed

12

in hospitals and 690 in outpatient facilities.

13

And so what is clear is when the outpatient

14

facilities began to do them, they did not draw from the

15

patient population of the hospitals who had been doing

16

them previously.

17

help to fill a certain portion of the unmet need for

18

second trimester procedures.

19

patients from the hospitals.

20

What they did, in fact, was merely

They were not taking

In fact, as Dr. Henshaw testified, who is a

21

national expert on the issue of these types of

22

statistics, that Missouri in 1979, again with only

23

hospitals to perform these procedures, was only meeting

24

13 percent of the unmet need for second trimester

25

procedures.

And in 1980, when both hospitals and

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

outpatient facilities. could perform them, the unmet need

2

went from 13 percent of the met need up to 34 percent;

3

still leaving some 66 percent of the second trimester

4

need unmet in Missouri.

5

The court also found that there was

6

substantial interference.

It certainly was much more

7

expensive, that they were not readily available by

8

reason of one hospital in the entire state being on the

9

western border, and in Missouri the other major

10

metropolitan area, St. Louis, is on the eastern border

11

of the state.

12

The appellate court found additional findings

13

to the district court.

14

when Roe was decided in 1973, a DEE procedure was

15

virtually unknown in the United States.

16

it was the safest procedure known, and they also made

17

the specific finding that non-hospital second trimester

18

D£E procedures are no more dangerous to maternal health

19

than hospitalized procedure.

20

QUESTIONS

21

MR. SUSMANs

They found, as was argued, that

They also found

Is that true throughout the period?
It was true throughout the period

22

that they were presently being performed in Missouri and

23

by the physicians who were the experts testifying.

24
25

QUESTION:

No, I mean is it true about — the

relative safety -- is it true throughout the second

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

trimester?
MR. SUSMAN;

2

I would suggest that it is

3

probably not true.

4

we have to realize of what percentage of procedures we

5

are talking about that are done beyond 18 weeks.

6

percent of all abortion procedures are conducted prior

7

to the 18th week.
QUESTION;

8
9

But I think in conjunction with that

98

Well, if the evidence shewed that

this relative safety was true only up to the 16th week,

10

for example, the statute arguably might be

11

unconstitutional, to that extent.
MR. SUSMAN;

12

But why on its face?

Because first of all, all second

13

trimester procedures were not really an issue in this

14

case.

15

the other methods, the installation methods, whether

16

they be saline, prostaglandin, urea or a combination of

17

many other types of chemicals were not in issue in this

18

case .

The evidence only went to the method of D6E, and

19

QUESTION;

No, but the question is whether

20

hospitalization is necessary.

21

MR. SUSMAN;

22

QUESTION;

As to whether --

Throughout the period, throughout

23

the second trimester.

24

MR. SUSMAN;

25

Correct.

Then if it does not eliminate

that period of time when it is not safer, then it has

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

not been narrowly ta lored.
QUESTIONS

2
3

But why is it invalid on its face?

This isn't a First Amendment case.
SR. SUSMAN;

4

I'm not sure but this requirement

5

is, in fact, invalid on its face.

6

have factual evidence on this particular type of

7

requirement.

8

face, in fact, is very beguiling and very deceptive.

9

And only when one hears the evidence and listens to the

10

physicians who perform the procedures, and looks at the

11

statistics, then can one look past the beguiling nature

12

of the statute on its face and see that, in fact, it

13

does not bear cut that, in fact, it is not safer.

15

I think the requirement itself on its

Yes.

testified, and the statistics, mainly went through 18

weeks.
QUESTION;

4

And — well, what was the period

5

during which the testimony indicated that aborting was

6

as safe as childbirth?
SR. SUSMAN;

7

For what limits?
The district court found through

the 18th week.

the 18th week of pregnancy.

And tell me again who was the

district judge?
MR. SUSMAN;

12
13

It makes a reference in a footnote, to

Judge Elmo Hunter, now senior

status.
QUESTION;

Mr. Susman, does Missouri license

outpatient clinics at all?
MR. SUSMAN;

No, Your Honor, although that's

17

not a complete answer.

We have an ambulatory surgical

18

licensing law that licenses certain ambulatory surgical

19

centers as opposed to hospitals.

20

only two classes of institutions licensed by the state;

21

hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers.

22

23

center and, therefore, deciding whether or not you have

24

to apply, does not cover abortion facilities, and there

25

is not a single abortion facility in the state that is

QUESTION;

2
3

Are abortion procedures

specifically barred by the regulations?
MR. SUSMAN:

4

No, Your Honor.

But it has to do

5

with certain portions of the definition of what is such

6

a facility, and abortion facilities do not fit into the

HR. ASHCF.OFT;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The balancing of rights reached by this Court

22

in Roe versus Wade included an explicit recognition of

23

compelling state interests which justify, if not

24

require, state regulation of abortions to protect the

25

individual health and safety of citizens.

No state can

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

properly ignore this responsibility; indeed, the state

2

of Missouri has not.

3

In the spring of 1979 the elected

4

representatives of the people, together with the people

5

themselves, wrestled with the concept of the proper role

6

for the state of Missouri in regulation abortions,

7

consistent with — consistently with constitutional

8

imperatives.

9

After hearings and testimony in both houses of

10

the legislature and debate in both chambers of the

11

legislature, along with substantial public discussion,

12

the state of Missouri forged a comprehensive program

13

meeting its responsibility to safeguard the wellbeing of

14

our citizens, and a program which would be subject to

15

change by the legislature in the light of adjusting

16

factors that they felt were necessary.

17

Four crucial elements of the state's

18

comprehensive program in relation to that abortion

19

regulation framework are before the Court today; the

20

second trimester hospitalization requirement, the second

21

doctor requirement for abortions of viable, unborn

22

children, the consent provision for minors, a pathology

23

requirement, and these are to be considered in this

24

proceeding.

25

The proceedings before the trial court and the

21

1

Circuit Court of App- als were basically a legislative

2

process assessing the wisdom of the Missouri enactments.

3

It's clear, inasmuch as the enactments have never been

4

in place, they were enjoined, all of the sections that

5

were challenged were enjoined within 24 hours after they

6

went into effect.

7

The trial objections made by the state

8

relating to standing and ripeness were brushed aside as

9

the district court plunged headlong into its assessment

10

of expert witnesses.

11

assessing an uninterpreted, unenforced statute, but a

12

statute which is alleged to be one which is infirm and

13

unconstitutional.

14

So this is a case where we are

Of the four abortion matters raised in this

Court, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals substantially

overruled the Missouri legislature on the other issues,

the issues of a second trimester hospitalization, a

unborn child, and a requirement for pathology.
The requirement for hospitalization for

4

abortion procedures conducted after the 12th week, of

6

pregnancy was ruled unconstitutional below.

7

believe that the district court and the Eighth Circuit

8

Court of appeals erred in so doing.

And I

The basic premise I believe that we can

9

10

understand from Roe versus Wade is a premise that the

11

state has an interest in guarding and protecting the

12

health of individuals; and secondly, that the state can

13

regulate to protect that interest.

14

interest and the ability of the state to regulate, most

15

states would accept that responsibility and so do.

I think given that

The problem that we see is that regulation is

16
17

impossible if this Court is to retreat from the bright

18

line drawn in Roe where it divided the time of a

19

pregnancy into areas when the state could exercise its

20

jud gm ent.

21

If, indeed, the courts are to pursue the

22

latest statement of the medical society or even a vocal

23

minority of individuals in the medical community, to

24

change what is allowable in terms of state statutes, I

25

think we'll find states in an impossible position; not

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

only impossible in terms of ever making judgments which

2

can withstand tests, but we’ll be finding ourselves here

3

over and over again relitigating issues over and over.

4

Roe clearly set forth some guidelines, and I

5

urge this Court not to retreat from its indication that

6

there are certain specific times in which the state

7

should be able to rationally regulate in relation to the

8

compelling interests of the state.

9

I believe that there is clear evidence in the

10

record of this case that the state can rationally

11

conclude that the facilities available in hospitals are

12

reasonably related to the objective of the preservation

13

and protection of maternal health.

14

I believe that the record in this case

15

supports the concept that the state can rationally

16

conclude that a second doctor at the abortion of a

17

viable, unborn child is rationally related to the

18

state’s separate and distinct interest in the potential

19

life of that child.

20

These are concepts which are --

1

as to the number of illnesses or such, or complications

2

that were caused by reason of second trimester abortions

3

being performed other than in a hospital?

4

MR. ASHCROFT;

There is some evidence about

5

complications and deaths outside of hospitals, but

6

basically, this evidence which was in the case took

7

place prior to the suspension of the law, during a

8

period of time when second trimester abortions were

9

required to be in hospitals in the state of Missouri.

10

I think Dr. Willard Cates of the Center for

11

Disease Control in Atlanta testified that of the 18

12

deaths that he had examined, 11 of them had been clinic

13

settings and 7 of them from hospital settings, relating

14

to those deaths in those abortion cases.

2

MR. ASHCROFT;

Not to my knowledge.

3

It is argued in this case that there is a

4

change in technology that has resulted in the concept of

5

hospitalization for second trimester abortions being

6

outdated.

in the case and to analyze the testimony presented.

8

There was an overwhelming consensus among the medical

9

experts at trial that the vast majority of abortions in

10

I think it's important to look at the record

post 12-week pregnancies belonged in the hospital.
Some of the record is confusing because the

11
12

Center for Disease Control statistics reflect what are

13

known as weeks of gestation rather than weeks of

14

pregnancy.

15

menstrual period, and according to Dr. Cates, who is the

16

Chief of Abortion Surveillance there, you have to

17

subtract two weeks from any of their statistics in order

to find out what the real impact is on weeks of

There is a dispute in the

weeks.

Didn’t it?

2

MS. ASHCROFT:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes, sir.

And the court of appeals affirmed

that.
MR. ASHCROFT:

5

Neither the district court nor

6

the court of appeals acknowledged to any willingness to

7

differentiate between the weeks of gestation statistics,

8

which were supplied over and over again, and the

9

Missouri statute’s requirement for weeks of pregnancy.
Now, Dr. Cates of the Center for Disease

10
11

Control, who was the most experienced of the witnesses

12

testifying in behalf of the plaintiffs, indicated that

13

at the end of the 15th week, which would be the end of

14

the 13 week in pregnancy terms rather than gestational

15

terms, that hospitalization would be appropriate.
I think what we’re talking about in those

16
17

kinds of circumstances when you put him in conjunction

18

with the expert witnesses of the state, is an overlap

19

perhaps of about seven days.
It ’s important also to note some other

20

21

things.

Of the 45 percent of the death cases that Dr.

22

Cates investigated, indicated that the physican had made

23

a mistake of at least four weeks in judging the fetal

24

age before performing the abortion.

25

fact, the Center for Disease Control statistics are all

And as a matter of

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

arrived at after the fact of the abortion through

2

post-abortion techniques.

3

I don't think, it's unreasonable at all, if

4

we're talking about an aperture of seven to maybe 14

5

days early in the second trimester, to give the state

6

the right to demand a margin of safety inasmuch as

7

doctors who are making the evaluations about whether or

8

not they're to conduct the abortion in a hospital or not

9

are frequently involved in having difficulty estimating

10

the fetal age in the pre-abortion context.
After the abortion, it's clear that the fetal

11
12

age is easier to estimate, but that certainly doesn’t

13

leave us with much leeway or much protection.

14

I think the point that I would like to make is

15

that there is a medical debate about a small fragment of

16

second trimester abortions.

17

to early D£E procedures.

18

to the end of the 15th week of gestation or the end of

19

the 13th week of pregnancy, as Dr. Willard Cates does,

20

or some would carry it as far as the district court

21

found.

22

That medical debate relates

Some would say that those go

In the situation where there is a medical

23

debate that rages, and there are significant medical

24

experts and credible individuals who will testify that

25

they all belong in a hospital in the second trimester,

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and there is a debate relating to just a small aperture

2

and just a narrow portion of procedures, I think the

3

state ought to have the ability to opt as a policy to

4

reqire second trimester hospitalization.

5

And I do not believe the technology has

6

advanced to such a degree in relation to this matter as

7

to take us away from the ability of the state in scoring

8

this debate to err on the side of safety, if you will,

9

and require its citizens who choose to have abortions in

10

the second trimester to have them in a hospital setting.

11

QUESTIONi

Mr. Ashcroft, one other question.

12

Are there any other areas of medical debate with which

13

you're familiar where the state legislature in Missouri

14

has opted on one side or the other of the debate, and

15

said they must do it the safer way?

16

specifically abortion-related legislation.

17
18
19

MR. ASHCROFT;
is abortion related.

MR. ASHCROFT;

I don't know in reference to a

That's correct, and it was not

allowed and declared unconstitutional by this Court.
QUESTION:

15

Could the legislature of a state

constitutionally require that all childbirths take place

17

in a hospital, absent an emergency?

MR. ASHCROFT:

I believe that it could.

I think.

The reservation of "absent

I don’t think the lack of money would really prevent

MR. ASHCROFT:

Is

We've made provision in

10

Missouri for individuals who seek — are having children

11

who don’t have the resources to afford the hospital

12

setting to be provided for in the hospital.

3

The second point that I’d like to make is to

4

address the issue of the need for a second doctor in the

5

operating room, or in attendance I would say more

6

specifically at the time an abortion is performed in a

7

case where there is a viable, unborn child.

8

really related to the third trimester of a proceeding.

9

Viability, according to the medical experts who

20

testified at trial, only occurs in the third trimester.

2

The earliest solid testimony in the record indicates

22

that 24 weeks; the consensus I believe would place

23

viability at 26 weeks.

24
25

Roe v. Wade indicated that there are, indeed,
separate and distinct interests in the state in the

potential of life, and that interest can be protected

2

reasonably.

3

It 's my view that the state of Missouri has

4

harmonized in a significant way the interests of the

5

mother and the interests of the unborn potential life in

6

its statute.

7

Ani I think it's done so quite well.

I should add that in the third trimester, the

8

law, as I understand it, is that there is no right to an

9

abortion except when the woman's health is endangered,

10

and therefore, we are not talking about the same kind cf

11

right relating to the woman in the third trimester that

12

we are in the second and first trimester.
We have two sets of rights then that are to be

13

guarded by the state and two interests that are

present.

significant testimony in the record, particularly the

testimony of Dr. Elizabeth James who was the Director of

19

Neonatal Intensive Care, a unit at the University of

who leave the environment of the mother at 26 weeks now

have a 50 percent chance of survival.

4

most important thing for a premature child, a newborn,

at that stage of development is that they begin to

job which requires the attendance of a physician.

First of all, the

Secondly, circulation, and she indicated that
heart massage may be necessary.

She pointed to the fact

10

that this is crucial that it be done expeditiously

11

because a failure to respirate can result in

12

neurological damage, so that while a child might

13

survive, it might not survive with the same quality that

14

it would otherwise have.

15

Given the fact that Roe v. Wade talked about

16

the potential for meaningful life existing, I think when

17

we're talking about that effort to make sure that the

18

respiration is there and we avoid neurological damage is

part of it,

The Eighth Circuit struck this down saying

22

that there are occasions when doctors might perform an

23

abortion in the period of viability using the D£F,

It dismembers the fetus, usually especially as

2

in larger fetuses which you would expect at late times

3

in development, as it withdraws the fetus from the

4

environment of the mother, and I think it's clear that

5

that fetus is not going to survive.
It was thought then that this statute be

6

7

overbroad because we required it in all abortions

8

pursuant to the determination by the physician of

9

viability.

I don’t believe that it is so overbroad and

10

I don't believe it is infirm.

And the court in Beal

11

versus Doe indicated that it's not until the time of

12

viability that the state has the right to unduly burden

13

the decision.

15

the state indeed has a right to place a heavy burden.

context, that a second physician is all that heavy a

burden which is imposed in

I think it’s important to note that sometimes a decision

20

will be made to use the D£E procedure, and the D£E

21

procedure would not be carried out as a result of

complications encountered in the procedure itself.

1

Another point that I think, ought to be made in

2

relation to the alleged over-breadth of the statute in

3

this context is that when the doctor who is choosing

4

what type of abortion ought to be made is selecting

5

between procedures, his awareness that a second doctor

6

will be involved in the operation I think is a

7

therapeutic influence.

8

9

D£E procedures are generally faster and easier
to conduct, and the one ioctor in this case that

10

testified that he used DCE procedures after viability is

11

the same doctor who testified that he believed that the

12

mother is always entitled to a dead fetus.

13

would do, and generally did, nothing to try and protect

14

the life of any newborn that was a result of an

15

abortion; that it wasn't his responsibility and he had

16

no interest in that.

17

And that he

I don't believe that that's a position which

the state of Missouri can accept.

potential for life is valid, that it's real, that it's

important and that we ought to protect it.

21

result, I do not believe that the requirement of a

22

second doctor after viability is an overly-broad

23

requirement.

burdensome, but it is well justified as a result of

compelling interest of the state; that compelling

QUESTION;

4

Does Missouri require the presence

of a second doctor with a premature normal birth?
MR. ASHCROFT;

5

The Missouri law does not.

6

There is testimony in the record that indicates that it

7

is a surgical practice for such to be the case, and I

8

believe that it's a good practice and I think it’s

9

appropriate for the legislature to recognize that and to

10

require it in these circumstances.
QUESTION;

11
12

You would recommend that the

legislature do this?

13

MR. ASHCROFT;

14

QUESTION;

Pardon?

You would recommend that the

15

legislature pass a statute requiring the presence of a

16

second physician, second surgeon, second OB, whatever

17

you want, in the delivery room for a premature, normal

birth .

provision of the statute.

3

That issue is related to the consent

These consent provisions, in my view, are as

close to a direct response to Bellotti 2 as you could

possibly get.

I believe that the state has met its burden in

10

this case, that it is clearly covered by the Bellotti 2

decision, and as a matter of fact, this consent

hr. Attorney General, did I

understand counsel for petitioner to say that the

16

Supreme Court of Missouri had not construed the consent

17

provisions and, therefore, we shouldn't address it here?

I think that’s what the

MR. ASHCROFT:

Well, Mr. Attorney General, does

Missouri have a certification procedure?

And this is the first time

No, we don’t.

Then how could we get it for the

state courts?

state courts would have to accommodate this Court by a

ruling.

Otherwise, we'd have to rely on the

Merely being there accomplishes nothing,

particularly when in fact, no procedure is being done in

Danforth case of the saline procedure is identical.

The

court in that case held -- and all of this language is

totally analogous here.

17

would prohibit the use of a method which the record
