Hr. Petersen, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF A. WELLS PETERSEN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

HR. ZIMMERHAN;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
Appellants are asking this Court to find
California's Penal Code Section 647(e), as interpreted

10

by People v. Solomon, constitutional; furthermore, that

11

when the statute is properly applied, it satisfies the

12

Fourth Amendment criteria; and finally, that when the

13

police acting properly under the statute request a

14

person to identify themselves, that that does not

15

violate their rights under the Fifth Amendment.

16

Now, the facts are normally in a case like a

17

Terry stop case, the facts are normally quite important

18

and very relevant.

19

surrounding the stop of Hr. Lawson are not relevant

20

because the matter will go back down for a trial at the

21

district court level, a jury trial on the facts.

22

Therefore, I think it would be inappropriate and really

23

they’re not relevant to a decision today, not at all.

24
25

In this particular case, the facts

It is first critical to review Appellants’
claim that the statute is constitutional as interpreted

by the Solomon court, and our first premise is that

Now, the court below recognized the statute engrafted

5

the guidelines from Terry through Solomon.

with Terry, we have clear standards

Therefore, before 647(e) ever comes into play

6

7

the police must have articulable facts demonstrating

8

their belief was reasonable that the person was acting

9

in a suspicious manner relating to criminal activity.

10

This standard and guideline ensures a tempered act of a

11

policeman.

As this Court held recently in Cortez, the

13

police action must be considered in light of the total

14

circumstances.

15

after considering the data at their disposal.

16

would be impossible to write either a statute or an

17

opinion that encompassed every conceivable situation

18

that could be considered suspicious, and that's a point

conceded by Appellee.

The police then act on probabilities,

16

MR. PETERSEN:

That's true.

17

But while these standards may lack, as I say,

18

the precision that some may wish, they certainly have

19

provided constitutional guidelines since their inception

20

that have guided courts throughout the country.

California has only memorialized the Terry stop by

statute and court opinion intertwined to give us a solid

19

In other words, a jogger stopped — and we all recognize

20

the fact that there are joggers now plying their trade

21

in sweatpants and sweatshirts because it makes them less

22

noticeable in the jogging atmosphere and they can run

23

away from their crime.

24
25

But if a person were jogging and wasn't
carrying their identification, the officer would merely

inquire where they lived and their name,

then asks them what the major intersection is near the

home, what the route was that he ran to get from there,

or where it is in relation to where the person was

Eut you then said the customary

procedure correctly applied under the statute is to

That's right.

Now, the —

23

The Wisconsin Supreme Court in Flynn

QUESTION:

Was that part of a patdown process

in Wisconsin?
MR. PETERSEN*

No, it was part of asking for

24

an identification.

It wasn't -- to my understanding of

25

Flynn, it was not part of seeking weapons.

It was, the

QUESTION1!

8

No, not to my knowledge they

Would the California statute then

allow the same information to be obtained, but in a
different way?
MR. PETERSEN:

11

We feel that there are

12

certainly ways to ask for a reliable identification

13

without interfering with the person's Fifth Amendment

14

rights, as Justice Stevens raised.

15

are certainly ways and avenues of inquiry which can be

16

used that will bring about the information that is

17

non-incriminatory.
QUESTION:

18

We feel that there

The California courts have

19

interpreted this statute to require the person stopped

for here.
QUESTION:

4

Suppose the officer is basically on

5

the lookout for the neighborhood rapist, who is believed

6

to drive a blue car.

7

on and inquire about, how did you get here, did you

8

travel in a car, what color?

Then under this statute can he go

9

Well, if we're talking about a

jogger, no.

Under Solomon the person

12

must be allowed to proceed.

That doesn't mean that some

13

time in the future when the detective who is

14

investigating the neighborhood rapist comes upon various

15

names seen under suspicious circumstances, that he

16

cannot go to the person's home and make further

inquiries under other circumstances.

about the "account for his presence" language in the

5

statute?
HR. PETERSEN:

6

What

The "account for his presence

7

language" has been interpreted by Solomon to mean only

8

that you provide reliable identification, not that I'm

here because I want to stand and watch something, or I'm

not here because -- I'm here at the corner because I’m

supposed to meet someone.

QUESTION:

14

HR. PETERSEN:

That's not part of the

Just all it goes to is -The Solomon court has said

that.
QUESTION:

16

Well,

I'm still — if it weren't

17

for that language, I would have been puzzled by your

18

statement that the correct practice under the statute

19

would be to ask a question such as, what are some of the

20

neighboring streets or how did you get from there to

21

here.

identification ?

23

25

You think that goes to the re liability of the

you stated, the officer disbelieved the person.

That's right.

But he doesn't tell him he thinks

MR. PETERSEN*

13

No.

Most of the time people

14

will — the interchange will result in that.

15

there's no requirement, as I stated before, that I know

is to find, is to gain the reliability of the

information.

If you suspect him as a

11

QUESTIONi

But

that doesn't

This statute provides, would you

say, wider latitude to police than the Terry stop?
MR. PETERSENi

No.

No wider latitude

12

whatsoever, because they're inextricably intertwined.

13

They form the basis.

14

Terry with a statute and say that Terry applies and you

15

can stop a person and ask them for identification under

16

Terry circumstances.

17

QUESTION:

All we've done is memorialize

It's a Terry stop.
But if under Terry you can't compel

18

someone to produce their wallet and their ID, how is

19

this statute not broader than Terry?

20

MR. PETERSEN:

Because Terry did not get to

21

the issue of requiring the person to provide his

22

identification.

23

mentioned was in Justice White’s concurring opinion,

24

when he said that when he asked them for identification

25

and he told them, Mr. Terry told the officer what his

I think the only place that was

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

identification was, in Justice White's opinion he said

2

that if he had chosen not to tell him he could have

3

walked away.
Under these facts and circumstances, we feel

4
5

that there's a reasonable governmental interest in

6

having the person provide his name, and the people of

7

California have so stated through their legislature.
QUESTION;

8
9

So it may be broader than Terry if

Justice White's view is correct?
MR. PETERSEN;

10

If Justice White's view is

11

taken as part of the opinion, it might be a tad

12

broader.

13

it's more restrictive, too, because if you don't have

14

reliable information under which you think your safety

15

is at stake you can't pat them down.

16

Let me start with the vagueness issue, and let

3

me pay particular attention to the issue which Justice

4

O'Connor has raised, the question cf whether or not this

5

statute in fact requires persons within the state of

6

California to carry and to display at all times upon

7

official demand proof of identification.

8

For in practice 647(e) is functionally

9

indistinguishable from the very sort of stop and

10

identify statute in application which this Court

11

specifically disapproved of in Brown versus Texas.

12

consequence of 647(e) is that in California there is an

internal passport requirement.

QUESTION;

2

Would you say, then, that a case in

which a Terry stop was made is not reviewable by the

4

courts because it's so esoteric they just wouldn't know

5

anything about it?
MR. ROSENBAUM;

6

No, of course not.

What Terry

7

established was an objective standard for courts to

8

review whether or not a stop which took place in the

9

past was constitutional or not.

But the critical point

10

for our purposes with respect to notice is whether the

11

individual on the street, the person who is being

12

detained by the officer, can make a judgment at that

13

time as to whether he or she wishes to state his or her

14

rights under Brown versus Texas and say, I don't believe

15

you have reasonable suspicion here, I don't want to have

16

to disclose my identity to you, I want to rest upon my

17

rights, or whether the person has any opportunity to

make that sort of judgment.

any more than they knew what the components of

Do you think the typical lay person

SR. EDSENBAUMi

7

Well, let me answer that in

8

two ways.

First, as I indicated to Your Honor, it is a

9

close question, but probable cause comes with a

10

different set of freight and it is more understandable.

11

Moreover, we are talking about a vagueness doctrine, and

12

as this Court has repeatedly recognized, last time in

13

the Hoffman Estates case, the drug paraphernalia case,

14

the Mesquite case, the case involving the licensing

15

ordinance, we will adjust our vagueness standards

16

depending upon the constitutional rights that are

17

involved .

18

In the probable cause situation which you

19

hypothesized, we are willing to draw perhaps a less

20

strong line in terms of what we would expect from the

21

individual himself.

22

that in the probable cause hypothesis that you state

23

there simply is no need for the sort of statute that

24

you're describing in the first place.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FiRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

we*re talking about, the problem of the individual on

2

the street, not having the skill and the training and

3

the experience of the officer, is compounded because

4

quite fundamentally that individual simply doesn’t have

5

the information available to the officer.

6

precipitates the Terry stop may be an informant’s tip,

7

as in Adams versus Williams, may be a DEA profile, as in

8

Reed versus Georgia, it may simply be a call from the

9

patrol car.

10

But whatever the basis of that information,

11

the individual on the street, who ought to be able to

12

decide comfortably with the knowledge that at the very

13

minimum that individual has the rights guaranteed by

14

this court in Brown versus Texas, simply has no way of

15

making an assessment as to whether or not a forfeiture

16

ought to exist here, whether or not it is proper to

17

disclose identification.

argument and the Fourth Amendment arguments are

2

compelling in this particular case.

3

the vagueness argument that I want to focus upon that

4

complements this particular notice requirement is the

5

fact that, as an incorporation of the Terry standard

6

within 647(e), that incorporation means that the statute

7

has no objective core.

The other prong of

standard because what is taking place here is that an

13

element of the crime is being defined by the moment to

What 647(e) does is to codify an officer’s

suspicions regarding wrongdoing and then to criminalize

suspicions or to furnish information.

You say it's not capable of being

applied in any situation?
MR. ROSENBAUMs

That's correct, because

whether you look at vagueness or whether you look at the

Fourth Amendment argument, what is inherent in this

11

statute is a forfeiture of the rights of privacy and

12

security and mobility that were guaranteed under Erown

13

versus Texas.

14

The arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement

15

therefore flows from the use of this investigatory

16

standard as one of the elements.

17

while this Court has indicated, has stated that it will

relax standards of vagueness in circumstances short of a

MR. ROSENBAUM;

If the officer could do that,

to arrest and this statute would not exist.

But I want to return to how this statute works
with respect to probable cause in its actual operation.

MS. ROSENBAUM;

That’s correct.

It is more --

it is more than just a reaching in for identification.

14

It is that plus, because then the individual is

2

And this Court stated that upon less than probable

4

permitted.

5

Now, what is significant about this case for

6

our purposes here is that that particular stop, that

particular intrusion to ask questions regarding

8

immigration status, was purely an investigatory act.

9

was no less investigatory than the sort of stops of Sr.

But what is critical here is that that

interest of crime prevention or detection which Kr.

4

Petersen would like to sustain this statute on, but

5

rather, was predicated very specifically on this

6

nation's peculiar problems in the area of immigration.

7

And the Court will recall Justice Powell, at

8

pages 881 and 82, specifically stating that any further

intrusion beyond asking about immigration status or

20

asking about the suspicious circumstances regarding

Not, as Mr.

Let’s look at that.
By Mr. Petersen's own tally, there are only

12

some eight states in the Union, only some eight states,

13

that even have statutes like this.

14

Petersen nor any of the amici filing papers on his

single fact that would indicate that it is the existence

17

of this statute that is responsible for the advantages

gained.

19

And neither Mr.

Nor would the statute itself preclude

20

investigations from going forward, for as Justice White

to continue whatever surveillance.
