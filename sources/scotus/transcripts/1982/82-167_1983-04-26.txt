ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. PAUL McGRATH, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

11

MR. McGRATHs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
There is but one issue in this case and that

12

is whether military personnel may be permitted to

13

maintain a damage action against their superiors for

14

alleged constitutional torts.

15

that they may, at least under certain circumstances, and

16

we ask this Court to reverse that ruling.

17

The Ninth Circuit held

The respondents were five black enlisted men

18

who were serving aboard the guided missile destroyer,

19

U.S.S. Decatur.

20

chief petty officers immediately above them on up to the

21

commander of the ship and charged that actions taken by

22

those superior officers were racially motivated and

23

therefore that the Equal Protection rights of the

24

respondents were violated.

25

They sued their superiors from the

The actions in question were actions taken in

particular duties.

5

6

scoldings, or in the words of the record below, being

7

chewed out by their superior officers.

8

9

They involved

They involved performance

They involved minor punishments for
And they involved

The District Court dismissed, on the motion of
the defendants, but the Court of Appeals reversed.

In

10

doing so, the court recognized that permitting an action

11

such as this to be maintained had serious drawbacks.

12

The court agreed that the mere maintenance of

13

such an action can be disruptive of military

14

discipline.

15

that permitting a civilian court at the beginning of

16

such a process to review the internal disciplinary

17

mechanisms of the service -- of the military services

18

could usurp military functions.

19

And the court also expressly recognized

But nevertheless the court held that a

20

constitutional damage action could be maintained and

21

that the superior officers were not entitled to absolute

22

immunity, and then it remanded the case to the District

23

Court to consider whether this particuar case could

24

continue in light of a four-part test which the court

promulgated.
The decision of the court below, if allowed to

3

stand, means at least two things.

4

every military commander is subject to damage suits by

5

his or her subordinate for any command decision taken

6

with respect to them.

7

is flatly inconsistent with the whole approach this

8

Court has taken to intra-military suits.

9

extremely troublesome in its impact.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

First it means that

And secondly, the decision below

And it is

And the same would go for the Fifth

Circuit case?
MR. McGRATH:

No, Mr. Justice White, the Fifth

13

Circuit case was a judicial review of the intra-military

14

process and it is clear that in certain circumstances

15

the review process within the military —

16

QUESTION:

17

support for this —

This case you don’t think lends any

18

MR. McGRATH:

It lends no support whatsoever.

19

We urge two bases for reversal here.

First,

20

under the Bivens case and the cases following Bivens,

21

this Court has consistently held that no constitutional

22

damage action will be implied if special factors counsel

23

hesitation.

24

Well in this case, the special nature of the

25

military command structure, as framed by Congress, and

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

its operation, are the special factors which counsel

2

hesitation in implying a Bivens remedy.

3

And secondly, under the Butz decision, this

4

Court has held, and in cases following Butz, this Court

5

has held that there should be absolute immunity afforded

6

to governmental officials if those officials have

7

special functions.

8
9

QUESTION*

You.mean against damages or

injunctions?

10

MR. McGRATH:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. McGRATH:

Against damages.

But not injunctions?
Not against injunctions.

13

Injunctions could still rest.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. McGRATH;

Yes.
If the special functions of the

16

individual could not be effectively carried out without

17

absolute immunity.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Butz also distinguished,

19

didn’t it, immunity, absolute immunity, from suit for

20

common law torts, as compared to constitutional

21

violations where it indicated qualified immunity.

22

MR. McGRATH:

Yes.

In the Butz case, they

23

were distinguishing Barr against Matteo which had held

24

at least if a federal officer was acting within the

25

scope of the office, they were generally absolutely

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

immune from nonconstitutional torts and held that in the

2

constitutional area the situation was different because

3

by definition, the federal official was acting outside

4

of any authority that the federal —
2UESTI0N:

5

6

Well we’re dealing with alleged

constitutional torts or violations here.

7

MR. McGRATH:

8

QUESTION:

9

10

Yes.

How do you distinguish the Wilkes

cases?
MB. McGRATH:

The Wilkes case, which was the

11

1851 decision of this Court which recognized that, at

12

least at that time, a military superior could be sued by

13

essentially — for essentially assault and battery, is

14

distinguished on several grounds.

15

First of all, that case lid not leal with a

16

constitutional tort.

17

Bivens type action, whether a governmental official

18

could be sued for a constitutional tort, was not decided

19

by this Court until 1971 in the Bivens case itself.

20

The question whether there was a

Secondly, the Wilkes case, to the extent it

21

can be read as permitting a nonconstitutional tort

22

action, is inconsistent with Barr against Matteo.

23

And third, that case really arises in a

24

different era.

It arises in an era when the military

25

was much smaller, did not have the elaborate system of

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

review that has been promulgated by the Congress since

2

then.

3

Feres and Stencel Aero, which we discuss in our brief.

It is inconsistent with this Court’s decisions in

4

It is not, in our view, necessary for this

5

Court to overrule the Wilk.es against Dinsman case in

6

reversing the Ninth Circuit, because it did not deal

7

with a constitutional tort.

8

those reasons it is not controlling.
QUESTION*

9
10

But we feel that for all

Do you think the plaintiffs here

could ask for injunctive or declaratory relief?
MR. McGRATH*

11

Not at this point.

For

12

instance, under the Mindes case and others, what the

13

courts have held, including this Court, is that the

14

intra-military actions are ultimately reviewable,

15

judicially reviewable.
Here there were a number of courses of action

16
17

that were open to the respondents.

18

sought action from the Board of Corrections of Naval

19

Records.

20

against their superiors and they could have sought other

21

remedies to deal with the particular things they were

22

complaining about.

23

They could have

They could have sought Article 138 proceedings

At the end of those processes, had they

24

availed themselves of them, and had the carrying out of

25

those processes not been done in accordance with the

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

statutes and the regulations in the Constitution, there

2

would have been ultimately judicial review under the

3

rules laid down by this and other courts.

4

But that is a wholly different situation from

5

the one we have here where before taking any of those

6

actions, this suit was filed and, as the record shows,

7

as the joint appendix showed, they took only in

8

desultory fashion, one or two half-hearted steps in

9

these directionse.

10
11
12

13

But, in any event, the

administrative remedies were never exhausted.
QUESTION;

The —

But if you can't get an injuction

here, it wouldn't be because of immunity.
SR. McGRATH:

If you could not get an

14

injunction here, it would not be because of immunity.

15

The injunctive part of the case, which actually was not

16

really focused on by the court --

17

QUESTION;

That was a prayer for declaratory

18

and injunctive relief.

19

MR. McGRATH;

The declaratory and injunctive

20

relief would be separate, that's correct.

21

principle bases that we rely on for saying that the

22

prayer for declaratory and injunctive relief should not

23

be allowed are, first of all, that there is no cause of

24

action stated.

25

QUESTION;

That the two

Your argument is that a Bivens

cause of action just shouldn't lie in this context at

all.

3

MR. McGRATHs

It should not lie in this

context at all.
QUESTION*

Whether for damages or for an

injunction.
MR. McGRATHs

Whether for damages or for

8

injunctive relief, but we do not rely on absolute

9

immunity when we're discussing the equitable question.

10

QUESTION i

If a claim was brought by someone

11

in the military, Marine Corps, for example, and said

12

that the training course was excessively harsh and

13

violent and they suffered injury, where would that kind

14

of claim stand under the Federal Tort Claims Act?

15

MR. McGRATH;

Under the Federal Tort Claims

16

Act, that case would not lie.

In the Feres decision of

17

this Court, it was held that a military -- military

18

personnel could not sue the government under the Federal

19

Tort Claims Act, at least for actions taken within the

20

military context.

21

a number of times since then, Mr. Chief Justice.

And that decision has been reaffirmed

22

QUESTIONS

How does that bear here?

23

MR. McGRATHs

I think that decision bears here

24

in this sense.

In the Feres case, this Court recognized

25

that the Tort Claims Act was broad enough, on its face,

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST 3T„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

to permit suits by military personnel.

Yet the Court

2

viewed the fact that suits by military personnel for

3

command decisions would have a particularly disruptive

4

effect on military discipline.
Having found that, the Court refused to imply

5

6

that military personnel could sue their superiors, could

7

sue the government under the Tort Claims Act for actions

8

by their superiors.

9

Court has paid a special deference to Congress in this

And that, we think, shows that this

10

area of intra-military disputes.

The Court has been

11

reluctant to add remedies onto those specifically

12

applied by Congress in this area because of the fact,

13

and the Court has stated it over and over again, the

14

threat of disruption of military discipline is so great.

15

The military, after all, is a unique

16

institution in our life.

17

that is designed to be prepared to send men into

18

combat.

19

that that single fact makes the military command

20

function and military discipline an overriding concern

21

and one that the Court should be very hesitant to

22

disrupt.

23

It is the only institution

This Court has recognized over and over again

The particular case before us, I think, is a

24

classic example of why the Court should refrain from

25

fashioning a new remedy here.

The plaintiffs were

11

AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

sailors on a ship.

As the record shows, that ship was

2

about to embark. on a five-month voyage to the Indian

3

Ocean right at the beginning of the Iranian crisis.

4

That meant, obviously, these men would be in very close

5

contact with their superiors during, perhaps, very

6

hazardous circumstances for a long period of time.
To import into that situation the added

7

8

artificial disruptive effect of an ongoing civilian

9

lawsuit between the subordinates and their superiors

10

could not possibly have anything other than a disruptive

11

effect.

12

the existence of the lawsuit can disrupt the functioning

13

of the military discipline process that we especially

14

urge that the court's decision below was incorrect.

15
16

And it is for that reason, the very fact that

1

the one hand, or under the Constitution, in the case of

2

federal officials, on the other, this Court has over and

3

over again stated that generally the same considerations

4

apply in either case.
QUESTION*

5

6

Does section 1985(3) reach actions

by federal officials?
MR. McGRATH*

7

Well, it would be our position

8

that it does not reach actions by federal officials in

9

any event.

There has been no decision by this Court on

10

that subject.

I think., however, that if you look at the

11

legislative history of that 1871 Civil Rights statute,

12

you will not find anything suggesting it was designed to

13

go against the federal government or federal officials.

14

The statute talks, on its face, about persons

15

in territories in the states which would tend to suggest

16

it wasn’t meant to so imply, so apply, but there is

17

really no definitive holding on that guestion.

18

What we would say, in any event, is that the

19

Court really does not have to reach that question, that

20

under cases such as Butz and Carlson against Green, if

21

this Court were to hold that a Bivens case would not

22

properly lie because it should not be implied because

23

special factors do counsel hesitation, that that same

24

reasoning should apply to 1985(3).

25

and also because under Feres and other cases, this Court

Both because of that

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

has been reluctant to imply new remedies in

2

intra-military suits.
QUESTION:

3
4

Now would all of the personnel

actions involved hare have been subject to review?
HR. McGRATH:

5

Yes.

All of the actions here

6

would have been subject to review.

8

with performance evaluation records.

Justice.

15

16

prominently is a ?50 fine for one of the men's having

left his clothes out in the work space just before an

18

inspection.

19

procedures within the military.

20

Those are all subject to

There ware minor punishments involved.

For

That was subject to the informal review

In short, every single action here was subject

21

to review under those provisions and also, I think,

22

perhaps even more important, under the Naval, Navy's

23

Equal Opportunity Program and its regulations, which

24

expressly bar discrimination in any form within the Navy.

25

I would like to just make one more point.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

The

1

number of times that this Court has dealt with

2

intra-military suits it, in each case, has pointed to

3

the fact that going too far in fashioning new remedies

4

would have an intrusive and disruptive effect on

5

military discipline.

6

to the fact that the military has its own internal

7

system of justice, which has been fashioned by Congress.

And in each case, it has pointed

He believe those decisions make total sense.
They make complete sense in this case where, I think,

10

everyone agrees that the implication of a damage remedy

11

would have the greatest personal impact on the military

12

command process and therefore we urge that the decision

13

of the Ninth Circuit be affirmed — be reversed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN MURCKO, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

18
19

20

MR. MURCKO*

Mr. Chief Justice, if it may

please the Court.
I represent five black sailors who are here

21

because they were intentionally discriminated against by

22

their commanding officer and other officers aboard the

23

U.S.S. Decatur in job assignments, in promotions, in

24

discharges, as well as in advancement in ratings, in

25

skilled ratings, in schooling for skilled ratings, and

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

also because of the fact that they were threatened with

2

violence and also subjected to various actions by people

3

who were sympathetic to the Klan aboard the ship, and no

4

action was taken by the command.
Before I get into my argument, I would like to

5

6

briefly relate some of the salient facts here, which we

7

think are particularly urgent and that show the

8

discriminatory, the serious discriminatory action by the

9

command.

10

QUESTION:

How high up does this go?

11

Do they sue the Chief of Naval Operations, on

12

the theory that he is the last word, or perhaps the

13

Secretary of the Navy for not having the right kind of

14

officers on the ship?

15

MR. MURCKO:

No, we think it only applies to

16

the officers that were involved in the intentional acts

17

of discrimination against the black people who were on

18

that ship and which deprived them of their

19

constitutional rights.

20

QUESTION:

What if they had -- what if they

21

had taken their complaint to the Admiral of the Fleet

22

and the Admiral had brushed it off and said these are

23

military command matters.

24
25

MR. MURCKO:

Is he subject to suit, too?

No, I don't believe so.

I think

it would only apply to those particular individuals that

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

were practicing the racial discrimination and wouldn't

2

go further than those particular individuals.

3

QUESTION:

What if an allegation was that the

4

Admiral tolerated this conduct?

5

HR. HURCKO:

Cause of action?

Well, if he condoned it and in

6

some way participated in it, then I believe that he

7

would definitely be responsible.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

I'm trying -- mine is just after

the event, the allegation is that these matters were
brought to his attention and he did nothing about them.
HR. HURCKO;

Well, the thing is if he had the

12

authority and the responsibility to take action against

13

these individuals and he knew that the commander was

14

involved in intentional racial discrimination and he

15

failed to take any action, then I believe that he would

16

also be a participant and would be responsible for the

17

discriminatory acts if they ware continuing and he knew

18

that they were continuing.

19

QUESTION:

What if he responded by pointing to

20

the provisions of the Code of Military Justice that

21

permits the enlisted personnel to make complaints

22

against their officers and said, here are your remedies?

23

MR. HURCKO:

I'm sorry, I don't understand

24

your question, Mr. Chief Justice.

25

repeat the queston?

Would you please

QUESTION:

1

Well, there ace other remedies for

2

military personnel within the structure of the military,

3

are there not?
MR. MURCKO:

4

Yes, that is correct.

There are

5

certain remedies.

There are certain remedies that are

6

available.

7

essentially are not adequate.

8

type of relief that Bivens states should be provided,

9

such as a damage remedy.

However, we think that those remedies
They do not provide the

In addition, under Article

10

138, an individual does have the right to report his

11

commanding officer.

12

However, we believe that this is a very

13

informal remedy and what occurs is that the commanding

14

officer calls in the individuals responsible, another

15

officer, another person, and they informally discuss it,

16

informally discuss it.

17

there’s no right to subpoena witnesses, there’s no right

18

to present evidence, it's just an informal remedy,

19

essentially, that is ineffective.

20

There’s no right to a hearing,

In fact, numerous federal courts have held

21

that these remedies, so-called military remedies, are

22

of that particular violation there, it was more a

18

So, we feel that Seaman Wallace here had been

19

intentionally discriminated against by Commander

20

Chappell, by Lieutenant Commander Viafore and by

21

Lieutenant Jordan where they intentionally kept him out

22

of 01 Division after he had been approved to go into 01

23

Division by the Personnel Development Board, which is a

24

board of five chiefs who make a determination if a

25

person is qualified.

The five chiefs said Wallace is

In addition, his division officer said yes,

2

he is qualified.

3

Intelligence Section.

He should be in the Operations

Yet Commander Chappell, as well as Lieutenant

4
5

Jordan, intentionally kept blacks out of the

6

Intelligence Division, because they felt that they could

7

not trust black people there, because they did not want

8

blacks in positions of authority and responsibility.
And so, as a result of that, they transferred

9
10

him out, they transferred Wallace out into the area of

11

the Deck Division.

12

there to chip paint as well as to swab the decks, which

13

is the traditional role of black people in the Navy.

14

Historically they have been kept either as stewards or

15

as people who worked in decks and unskilled jobs.

And essentially, he was required

In addition, he had been threatened, Wallace

16
17

had been threatened by his division officer on more than

18

one occasion to be transferred out because of the fact

19

that he was speaking up about the treatment of blacks on

20

that ship.

21

Also, Wallace had been subject to the actions

22

of Klan sympathizers on the ship.

Some sympathizer hung

23

a noose in his work space.

25

caused great consternation for Seaman Wallace, put him

This was done in the presence of Lieutenant

2
3

Jordan, as well as Chief Parks.

They knew that it was

4

there, yet they didn’t order it down.

They did not

5

bring the responsible people to task.

And Wallace

6

complained to them and they did nothing about it.
In addition, there was numerous graffiti in

7

8

the work spaces that the Klan put, including "Kill

9

Colored Kids — KKK."

This was reported to Lieutenant

10

Jordan, to Commander Chappell.

They took no action to

11

clean up, to clean it up or to get the responsible

12

people.

essentially clean up the ship in that sense.

And the respondents were involved in trying to

18

of the fact that he had been complaining about the

19

treatment of blacks on the ship.

20

He had been threatened by Lieutenant Bianco,

And also, he was given a low evaluation because

After the suit was filed, there were more

21

threats by these officers.

Hickey was threatened to be

sent to Deck Division because of the fact that he filed

23

the suit and the others were essentially required to be

Richardson, because of the fact that they filed the suit.

1

Moving on to the argument, ve think that

2

first, it appears that the government, in their reply

3

brief, concedes that in cases involving unconstitutional

4

conduct by officers are revievable in federal court for

5

injunctive and declaratory relief.

6

two and footnote two.

7

essentially they accede the question of jurisdiction of

8

a federal court over these issues.

9

And that's on page

So we think, in this case, that

In addition, we feel that they accede the

10

question of justiceability.

11

we feel at this time, is the question of damage remedies

12

and we feel essentially that, in this particular case,

13

that the plaintiffs, the black sailors should be treated

14

the same as any other litigants in federal courts and

15

they are entitled to damage remedy for violation of

16

their constitutional rights.

2UE3TION;

So the sole question here,

Would you limit this sort of relief

to peacetime, or would you carry it into wartime?
MR. MURCKO;

No, we just limit it to

20

peacetime, Mr. Chief Justice.

21

what the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did and we stand

22

behind the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 100 percent.

23

We think that that is

We think that the damage remedy is the

24

narrowest form of remedy in the courts and we feel that

25

the injunctive relief that the government said it

It's much more

other considerations.

That is correct.

They may oppose

8

it in this case. Your Honor, but as a general rule, they

9

said they're not opposing the fact that a service

personnel does have the right to go to court and seek an

injunction against his superiors who are violating his

constitutional right and that's in writing, Your Honor.

MR. MURCKOi

Yes, I do urge you to move

cautiously here, Your Honor, that is correct.
And in addition, we feel that the government

4

also apparently concedes that there is still racial

5

discrimination in the Naval when it states that on page

6

nine, footnote 8 of their brief, that the U.S. military

7

is making headway against racism.

8

racism is a problem in the military and we feel that

9

essentially there must be, these individuals must have

They recognize that

10

the right to vindicate their rights to be free of racial

11

discrimination in the Navy.

12

We think that an important point that the

13

government makes essentially is that whether Congress

14

has enacted a gold remedy for servicemen.

15

what they’re trying to do is state Bivens on its head.

16

Because Bivens states that there is a cause of action

17

under the Constitution for violation of Constitutional

18

rights, unless there are special factors counseling

19

hesitation in the absence of a remedy by Congress.

20

And we think that essentially the remedy

Essentially,

21

exists under Bivens for these black servicemen, but the

22

government essentially is trying to deprive these black

23

sailors of the right under Bivens by saying that

24

Congress never. Congress never provided a remedy.

25

the remedy is there.

Congress never provided an

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Well,

1

alternative, specific remedy and the thing is, we don't

2

think that that’s required.

3

But even more, we feel that Congress has

4

spoken in this area.

In 1976, it issued a statute,

5

10 USC 1089, which essentially gave absolute immunity to

6

military medical personnel for any acts that they

7

perform in the military and only makes the government

8

reponsible for their acts.

9

recognized that officers of the military are subject to

Well, at that time, Congress

10

liability, otherwise they would not have had to pass

11

this statute.

12

And we feel that by doing so, if it intended

13

to preclude liability, it would have included all

14

officers in there.

It would have made all officers

15

absolutely liable.

But it did not do so.

16

medical personnel are not liable.

17

think they recognized the authority of Dinsman v. Wilkes

18

and Wilkes v. Dinsman which holds that a superior

19

officer is responsible for the violation of the rights

20

of people under his command.

21

QUESTION;

It just said

And by doing so, we

I take it, then, you wouldn't --

22

you would say Congress could say, in providing remedies

23

before the Corrections — Board of Corrections, for

24

example, that this remedy shall be exclusive.

25

MR. MURCKO;

Yes, that is correct.

Then we’d have to make a determination

That is not this case, Justice White.

QUESTION;

12

That is another
We feel

Well I think — what if we happened

13

to disagree with you and thought that the provision of

14

these other remedies for some or all of these acts was

15

intende! by Congress to be the exclusive remedy —

16

MR. MURCKOs

17

QUESTION;

Well, the thing is —
— and at least it presents the

18

sort of a situation where you should not imply Bivens

19

remedy.

20

then do we have to reach some constitutional issue?

21

What if we thought that and disagreed with you,

MR. MURCKOs

Well, we think this Court in

22

Carlson v. Green stated that the remedy of the Federal

23

Tort Claims Act is not adequate for prisoners because it

24

does not provide the type of relief that the

25

Constitution requires and that these other relief that

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

have been passei by Congress was not adequate in

vindicating the constitutional rights.
QUESTION;

3

But we didn’t suggest that Congress

4

couldn’t have provided — that there wouldn’t be a

5

Bivens remedy in the Carlson against Green situation,

6

did we?
MR. MURCKO;

7

No, that’s correct.

No, the

8

thing is I'm not saying that Congress can’t provide a

9

remedy, I’m talking about whether Congress provides an

10

immunity —
QUESTION:

11

12

They can provide a remedy and they

can also make it exclusive.

13

MR. MURCKO:

That is correct.

14

In addition, we think another important

15

question here is the question of immunity, whether

16

military officers are entitled to qualified or absolute

17

immunity.

18

the main argument of the government here is whether or

19

not there is going to be a breakdown in discipline

20

caused by these particular types of actions.

And we think that in this particular case,

21

We think that when there's racial

22

discrimination involved, that the discipline has, the

23

special relationship between a sailor and his

24

commissioned officer as well as the discipline, has

25

already broken down.

It has broken down by the

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

intentional discrimination and we feel that essentially

2

the disciplinary effect on a sailor is that the damage

3

action presupposes an obeyance of the orders,

4

otherwise --

5

QUESTION;

6

can use the brig, can’t they?

7

NR. MURCKO:

8

QUESTION;

9
10

If the discipline breaks down, they

Excuse me.
If the discipline really breaks

down, they can use the brig or whatever the equivalent
is on board ship.
NR. MURCKO:

11

Yes, that is correct.

That is

12

correct.

13

Discipline means also affecting the relationship as far

14

as people's attitude toward number one, the enlisted

15

person has toward his officer and number two, the

16

attitude that the officer has toward the enlisted.

17

But discipline doesn’t just mean punishment.

And we feel essentially that the — there must

18

— that special relationship must be kept intact and we

19

say that it’s affected by the intentional

20

discrimination, long before the suit is brought, the

21

intentional discrimination destroys that special

22

relationship which we think is so important to the

23

national security of our country.

24
25

And we think that by the time the suit is
brought, it does not affect the discipline because

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

essentially what this individual is trying to do is

2

vindicate his rights and try to put a stop to the

3

intentional discrimination action caused by his superior

4

which, in effect, is causing harm to the military.

5

6
7

QUESTION;

Do you think, it'll encourage suits

out of the Ninth Circuit?
MR. MURCKO:

No, I don't think it would

8

encourage suits any more than it would now, because of

9

the fact that --

10

QUESTION:

The Ninth Circuit, if we hadn't

11

taken the case, do you suggest this would have no impact

12

on suits by military personnel against their officers?

13

MR. MURCKO:

Well, I wouldn't say it would

14

have no impact at all, but I’m saying that essentially

15

there’s an economic question here.

16

a question here of whether servicemen can afford to

17

retain attorneys to bring suit on their behalf because

18

of the fact that they make such a low amount of pay.

19

Number one, there’s

Second, they don't qualify for legal services

20

under the indigency program because of the fact that

21

they make over $300 a month.

22

is many attorneys will not take these type of case when

23

they know there is no great remuneration involved for it.

24
25

And in addition, the fact

So we don't believe that there's going to be
any flooding of the gates for these type of suits.

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

And

1

in addition, the government only points to approximately

2

10 suits in their brief when there are over two million

3

service personnel.

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. MURCKO;

6

Well, if we win, Your Honor,

Justice White --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MURCKO;

9

But if you win, what will happen?

You did win in the Ninth Circuit.
That's correct.

If we win here

and then essentially we’d go back and all we're entitled

10

to is a hearing to determine whether or not Mindes

11

entitles us to a trial.

12

So we've been waiting five years for a trial,

13

Justice White, and we haven’t gotten any step closer,

14

any closer to that.

15

We think essentially that the primary question

16

here is the question of immunity.

And we think that the

17

qualified immunity is the norm under the Harlow v.

18

Fitzgerald case.

19

immunity that military officers are entitled to.

20

We think that that gives naval oficers

And we think that that is the type of

21

adequate protection against suits by their inferiors.

22

We think that essentially only recognized constitutional

23

claims can be brought.

24
25

In addition, we think that any frivolous suits
can be dismissed under a Motion for Summary Judment.

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

In

1

addition, we feel that there — the arguments by the

2

government that there is essentially an absolute

3

immunity here has no basis in the common law.

4

common law provides essentially, as the Dinsman case

5

holds, that military officers do not have absolute

6

immunity.

7

Dinsman held that military officers do not have absolute

8

immunity.

20

MR. MURCKO:

Excuse me, I thought you

Yes, that's right.

That's correct.

That's

21

correct.

But Dinsman v. Wilkes says

22

that naval officers, United States Navy, are answerable

23

for common law torts when they are intentional and

24

malicious, so there is no common law basis for this

25

absolute immunity the government is asking.

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

In addition, the judicial immunity that this

Court has recognized as well as the prosecutorial

3

immunity is also a rule in the common law.

of the British were sustained?

15

WR. MURCKO:

Yes, that's correct.

We do cite

16

numerous cases from the common law of England which

17

allowed suits against the officers there for intentional

18

violation of their inferior's rights.

19

actions were upheld.

20
