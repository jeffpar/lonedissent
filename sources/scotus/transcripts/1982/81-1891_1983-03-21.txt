Mr. Larson, I think you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR LARSON, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. LARSON:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

8

The question in this case is under the Longshoremen's

9

Compensation Act should employer contributions into union trust

10

funds for health and welfare, pensions and training for the first

11

time in history be included in the concept of the individual's

12

average weekly wage for purposes of calculating his benefits,

13

adding on the average of 30% to 40% to those benefits which now

14

stand at 88% of take-home pay?

15

intent of Congress.

16

cators of that intent, the clear language of the statute, the

17

legislative history of the Act and of its amendments, and above

18

all, the fact that Congress could not possibly have intended an

19

interpretation of the Act that would severly damage the function­

20

ing of the Act and its ability to carry out its purposes.

21

The legal issue, of course, is ths

Unfortunately, all the three major indi­

First, I would like to say just a word about why this

22

case came as such a bombshell to the compensation community.

23

Workers' compensation has been with us for 70 years and the

24

Longshoremen's Act for 55.

25

millions of cases have been disposed of on the understanding that

During that time literally tens of

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

wages meant wages along with traditional non-cash wage sub­

2

stitutes such as board and lodging.

3

told that all those thousands of judges and administrators and

4

lawyers and employers and employees and unions were wrong all

5

along in what they thought wage included and overnight we are

6

supposed to accept a new meaning of wage which, believe it or

7

not, will raise benefits above pre-injury take-home pay and all

8

this by judicial, not legislative action.

9

QUESTION:

Now, suddenly we are being

Mr. Larson, would you tell us what

10

happened to the legislation that had been introduced in the

11

Congress, I guess, to overrule the decision below?

12

MR. LARSON:

Yes.

There is a bill pending in Congress

13

right now — There was a bill last year which passed the Senate.

14

The bill pending in Congress now has a small clause in there

15

which in effect would undo the effect of this for the future.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LARSON:

18

Did the House take any action on the bill?
So far this year I don't think anything

has happened.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LARSON:

21

Now, of course, there are two reasons at least why

And last year the House took no action?
No, they took no action last year.

22

this doesn't really affect this decision very much.

23

is, as we all know, it is a long distance between introducing

24

a bill, especially on workers' compensation, and getting it

25

passed.
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

The first

1

But, the other is that even if it were passed,

2

enormous damage would be done just in cases now pending.

3

lot of them are hanging fire right at the moment.

4

more seriously, under the very permissive reopening provisions

5

of the Longshoremen's Act, tens of thousands of cases would be

6

reopened on the theory that there was a mistake of fact in the

7

determination of the benefits.

8

consequences, as we have outlined in our brief, would happen.

9

QUESTION:

A

But, even

So, most of the damaging

Assuming you are correct, what happens to

10

things like medical insurance premiums that might be paid to

11

a fund by the employer in the future?

12

MR. LARSON:

There are, of course, all kinds of

13

benefits under this plan and the various others that occur

14

and under some plans the medical payments go on during dis­

15

ability and others they don't.

16

death cases, they would not go on.

17

Of course, in the case of

But, what we keep coming back to in this case is,

18

of course, the intent of Congress and the intent of Congress

19

is very well expressed in this case in the short but very

20

specific definition we have been provided which is that wages

21

means the money rate at which the service rendered is recom­

22

pensed under the contract of hire in force at the time of

23

injury, including the reasonable value of board, room, housing,

24

lodging, or similar advantage received from the employer and

25

gratuities received in the course of employment from others
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

than the employer.

2
3

Now, the simpliest way for the Court to dispose of
this —

4

QUESTION:

Of course, that is the problem.

So, if

5

you are right, how do we distinguish in the future between

6

payments such as rent and board and, on the other hand, medical

7

insurance?

8
9

I mean, what is the line?
MR. LARSON:

The principal distinction — This is the

one that has always controlled these cases of so-called similar

10

advantage.

11

it means anything, having a clear and present cash value now

12

and also being paid directly by the employer to the employee.

13

Those are the distinctions under which — For example, vacation

14

pay is included and overtime and under certain circumstances

15

transportation.

16

There are two things:

Similar advantage means, if

Well, obviously, the fund payments aren't the money

17

rate.

18

to the employee.

19

it isn't housing, and, as I have just indicated, it isn't

20

similar advantage.

That, in the common term, is the cents per hours paid
It certainly isn't board, it isn't lodging,

21

Now, there is another way this Court —

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Larson, I suppose that some payments

23

by an employer of board or lodging might not be paid directly

24

to the employee at all.

25

MR. LARSON:

Well, I think in almost every case it

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

is either furnished directly or the money is furnished directly,

2

but it has a present cash value and this is a traditional thing

3
4

and it is written, of course, — It is written right into the
statute so it can't be controversial.

5

6

QUESTION:

present cash value then?

7

MR. LARSON:

19

20
21

22

They might, yes, but they are not paid

by the employer to the employee.

That is one of the difficulties

And, they are not written into the statute as part of the
definition which makes a crucial distinction.

11
12

Would certain medical benefits have a

I think another — A!simply :way the Court could dispose
of this case would be by direct application of the rationale
of Potomac Electric Power Company against the Director decided
by this Court just two terms ago.

There this Court held that

since the Longshoremen's Act was copied verbatim from the New
York one and since it employed terms which had accepted meaning
in 1927 when the Longshoremen's Act was passed, Congress should
be deemed to have intended the meaning that prevailed at that
time.
Now, to carry out over to the present situation, it
is only necessary to observe that when the Longshoremen's Act
was first passed the meaning of wages that we are talking

23

about was not only dominant, which is the word in Pepco, it

24

was absolutely universal.

25

But, now I think we can carry this down to the
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

present more cogently by applying the Pepco principle to the

2

1972 amendments which were in effect, the re-enactment — they

3

were such massive amendments -r*particularly because the central

4

concern of the 1972 amendments was exactly what we are talking

5

about here, the benefit level.

6

The remedy chosen by Congress to deal with that bene­

7

fit level problem was to make the ceiling flexible and, indeed,

8

the benefits went from $70 a week to $500.

9

Now, as you recall, the heart of the 1972 amendments

10

was a sort of trade off between the longshoreman giving up

11

his rights of unseaworthiness against a ship in exchange for a

12

dramatic increase in compensation benefits.

13

Now, the point, for present purposes, is that in

14

striking this balance everybody had to start from a common

15

understanding of what wages included.

16

to anybody that a new meaning of wage was going to come along

17

that would in itself raise the benefits 30% to 40%, can anybody

18

suppose that this same balance would have been struck.

19

This was not an oversight.

If it had ever occurred

By 1972, these fund

20

contributions into union plans were a very conspicuous feature

21

of the labor sea and Congress had just a few years before had

22

to deal with it in connection with the Davis-Bacon Act which

23

has a sort of parallel history to the Longshoremen's Act and

24

it dealt with it by simply writing a detailed provision into

25

the Davis-Bacon Act spelling out that union fund contributions
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

are included in the concept of wage.

2

Now, in

'12,

Congress, in connection with the

3

Longshoremen's Act, theoretically could have done the same

4

thing.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. LARSON:

7

QUESTION:

8

Mr. Larson?
Yes.
When was the Davis-Bacon Act amended to

include —

9

MR. LARSON:

'64.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LARSON:

12

Congress could have theoretically done this, but in

'64?
Yes.

13

the thousand pages of testimony, no one even thought of sug­

14

gesting it, not because they weren't aware of it, but it just
«

15

didn't occur to anybody as being even remotely: practical and there

16

were a lot of reasons for that, but I think the most obvious

17

is that while the Davis-Bacon Act is a collective figure for

18

a whole area, under the Longshoremen's Act you have to determine

19

an individualized figure for every single employee and that

20

would have been administratively absolutely impossible.

21

Now, as to the third and final part of the congres­

22

sional intent, I am going to take again as my text a passage

23

from Pepco in which this Court said it is not to be lightly

24

assumed that Congress intended the Act to produce incongruous

25

results.

Well, the decision below would produce results that
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

are not only incongruous but severely damaging to the entire

2

functioning of the system.

3

The first most serious damage that I would briefly

4

mention and that is that benefits would actually go above pre­

5

injury take-home pay.

6

workers’ compensation or any social insurance system.

Now, this is the ultimate nightmare of

7

A couple of quick ways to demonstrate this —

8

QUESTION:

9
10

When you are making that argument, would the benefits go above
you say above take-home pay.

11

MR. LARSON:

QUESTION:

13

MR. LARSON:

14

QUESTION:

21

But not above gross pay?
Well, they would even do that in some

pay if you included the fringe benefits as part of gross pay?

Take-home pay.

cases, but I am making the mildest —

15
16

May I ask you a question, Mr. Larson?

MR. LARSON:
pay.

In many cases they would go above gross

In high salary brackets, they definitely would.
QUESTION:

Even if you include in gross pay the

payments to the pension funds and the like?
MR. LARSON:

Yes.

They would definitely — There

22

are elaborate calculations in some Of our briefs, full

23

tables of what would happen.

24

take-home pay obviously has a lot to do with taxes, the higher

25

you go in salary brackets, the —

And, since the disparity as to

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

If that is true, if it is higher than gross

2

pay even including fringe benefits, I suppose it is possible,

3

even under your view, that benefits may —If you define wages

4

the way you argue, benefits may in some cases exceed wages.

5

MR. LARSON:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LARSON:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LARSON:

10

They do now?
They do now, yes.
So there would be no difference under —
There would be a great difference in

the amount by which they exceeded.

11
12

They do now, yes.

QUESTION:

But, the mere fact that they exceed is not

a critical difference.

13

MR. LARSON:

Well, the Comptroller General pointed

14

this out in his report a couple of years ago and I am simply

15

quoting him when he says that in some cases it is at least

16

theoretically possible to show that the present thing could go

17

above.

18

But, what would happen under this decision below

19

is practically all of the benefits, and certainly on the

20

average, would go above prior take-home pay.

21

Take the Atlantic and Gulf contract for example.

22

Under the Atlantic and Gulf contract, which is typical of the

23

longshoremen's contracts, the take home pay for a year averages

24

$20,200.

25

a year.

The compensation benefit payable on that is $24,100

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

2

MR. LARSON:

3

Now, needless to say, the impact —

4

QUESTION:

5

8
9
10
11

Under the decision of the court below.

Well, in that example, $20,200 is the take-

home pay and —

6
7

Under the decision of the Court of Appeals?

MR. LARSON:

Twenty thousand two hundred is the take-

home pay.
QUESTION:

What would the comparable figure be if

you included the amounts paid to the pension funds on behalf
of that employee?
MR. LARSON:

That — I can give you the exact figures.

12

The amount paid into the pension fund, the contributions, on a

13

wage of $12.80 was $4.59.

14

QUESTION:

15

the $20,200 figure?

16

So, you actually have an example that doesn't support your case.

17

MR. LARSON:

18

QUESTION:

Well, what is the figure comparable to
Is it more than $4,000?

I think it is.

Well, the —
You are really comparing oranges with

19

apples when you include the payments for one purpose but not

20

for the other.

21

MR. LARSON:

22

QUESTION:

23

I am including them all, of course.
The $20,200 figures, does that include

the amounts paid into the pension fund?

24

MR. LARSON:

25

QUESTION:

No, no, it doesn't.
Whereas the $24,000 does?

MR. LARSON:

But, you see, what we are concerned with

is in the last amounts of this incentive to the worker and what
he sees obviously is if he works he gets $20,200 and if he
doesn't work he gets $24,100 and no amount of talk about the
employee's value of what goes into the fund will make much
difference to him, because, you see, there is not a direct pipe­
line of that fund contribution from the employer into the pockets
of the employee.

It goes into a trust fund and he may or may

not some day profit by it.
QUESTION:

You could have made a similar argument

in

1927 if the employee had a very low take-home pay, but got
free room and board and a lot of tips.
MR. LARSON:

Well, they wrote this into the Act

definitely because room and board — And, of course, they had
to write tips in.
QUESTION:

Of course, the employee in 1927 saw a

right with his monthly paycheck the benefit of a rent payment
or a food payment.

And, an employee today doesn't see on a

monthly basis the pension payment.
MR. LARSON:
never will see it.

He doesn't see it as in many cases he

There is a very indirect relation between

what goes into these funds and what comes out.
For example, in Mr. Hilyer's case, he didn't work
long enough to get anything.

QUESTION:

That is the nature of the

Of course, it is hard to compare, Professor

4

Larson, this man because he will not be working any more, he is

MR. LARSON:

Probably the most damaging —

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That is right.

You speak of massive — I think that was

the word you used — on the one side, but imposed death is
also rather massive.

11

MR. LARSON:

12

QUESTION:

13

That is right.

I didn't hear that.
I say imposed death, being killed on the

job is also massive.

14

MR. LARSON:

I want to say with all my heart that

nothing in the world can compensate people for the loss of a

it will be virtually automatic and self-executing.

It doesn't even pay for pain and

It doesn't pay for loss of consortium.

It doesn't

It is a very

Less than a month ago this Court in the Lockheed case

23

put its finger right on it.

24

compensation is to pay benefits that are fixed and immediate

25

and without litigation.

It said the purpose of workers'

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Well, as for being fixed, they won't be fixed at all

2

because there is going to have to be an individual, tailor-made

3

calculation for each employee in relation to each employer as

4

to each fund, and some employers have ten of them, against the

5

backdrop of controversy about what kinds of benefits should go

6

in.

7

others.

8

evaluate all these assorted plans?

9

some are on a per-tonnage basis, some of them are on an arbitrary

We just have a small sample here.

There are many, many

And, the worst controversy of all is how do you
Some are on a per-hour basis,

10

actuarial basis in which the employee simply pays in whatever

11

is necessary.

12

So, far from being immediate, the benefits would be

13

delayed by years, and as for being without litigation, of course,

14

litigation will be enormously increased.

15

There is another very direct way in which the worker

16

is going to get hurt.

17

realizes that this whole system of compensation is all about

18

the worker.

19

about employers, it is about the worker.

20

gets undermined, the worker and his dependents are going to be

21

the ones that ultimately lose and this is one of the ways

22

they are going to lose, by the delay in their payments for

23

years, whereas now, at least so far as this item is concerned,

24

they are virtually automatic.

25

Let me just say here I think everybody

It is not about insurance companies, it is not

Now, that may partially explain the fact that neither

7

the International Longshoremen's Association nor any other

8

union of longshoremen has joined in this litigation.

9

In the District of Columbia, about 15,000 jobs were

10

lost in six years largely for the same reasons which may explain

11

the fact while the AFL-CIO District Council filed a brief in

a petition for certiorari, they have not filed a brief on the

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT DIRECTOR SUPPORTING PETITIONERS

20

MR. HOROWITZ:

21

22

Thank you.
Mr. Horowitz?

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I would like to discuss what I believe is the under­

23

lying premise of the Respondent's contention in this case and

24

that is looking at wages contemporaneously any common sense

25

notion of wages must include the contributions and, therefore,
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

whatever the intent of Congress was in 1927, the statute today

2

must be construed to cover them.

3

This premise is false.

In fact, common sense does

4

not dictate that these contributions must be covered and that

5

is particularly true in the workers' compensation context.

6

Such contributions are generally not treated as wages in other

7

contexts and they have never been so treated under the Long­

8

shoremen's Act.

9

as viewed in the abstract, are quite different from ordinary

This is so, because the contributions, even

10

wages.

11

benefit particular employees only in an uncertain and indirect

12

way.

13

They are paid to union administered funds and they

Moreover and more important, in the specific workers'

14

compensation context, they are unlike wages in that they

15

generally do not represent income loss to the employees'

16

beneficiaries by reason of his disability or death and, there­

17

fore, income that must be made up by the longshoremen's benefit

18

in order to pay expenses that the widow will have to pay later.

19

I would like to speak first to Justice O'Connor's

20

question earlier about whether there is really .value to some

21

of these things that must be replaced.

22

important to note is that the Court of Appeals itself never

23

attempted to value these benefits.

24

like medical insurance does have a value to the worker and to

25

his family, but the Court of Appeals never made any effort to

employee.

These

They are just made to the funds in general.
Now, the fund invests those contributions in a way

6

that does rebound to the benefits, to the benefit of employees

7

as a whole but not in a way that rebounds the benefit of a

8

particular employee.

9

I think that can be seen by looking at the pension

10

plan involved here.

11

me, the employer makes contributions for every hour worked by

12

and employee, but an employee does not necessarily receive

13

pension credit for each of those hours.

14

minimum level he must reach before any pension credits are

about whether rent payments,which are specifically authorized

by the statute should perhaps, under the theory propounded

by Petitioner, really ought not be considered in the wage base

taken in the payment, rather than paying the money to the

employee who then passes it on to the apartment building, the

like the Court of Appeals said, for the money to be passed on
to the employees.
QUESTION:

How about the medical benefits for the

family?
MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, in a case like this where the

employee has died and if the union had given him an insurance
policy to cover the medical benefits for his entire family,
that probably is an expense that the beneficiaries would have
to pick up afterwards.

In a disability case I am not sure

that would be so because these insurance policies often
continue for disabled employees.
I think my answer to that question has to be that
you have to look at the Act as a whole and at these benefits
as a whole.

There is no way under the statutory definition

really to distinguish between life insurance, medical insurance,
training funds, et cetera, et cetera.
QUESTION:

I guess the question is whether it is a

23

similar advantage.

24

that it would go to the family for their medical care?

25

But, as

we explained in our brief, the funds are not simply a channel

Now, how would you treat that to the extent

MR. HOROWITZ:

advantage for many of the reasons specified.

paid directly, the benefits received by the employee are very

3

uncertain.

4

The money is not

What I would say is that it does make some economic

5

sense for medical insurance benefits to be included in the wage

6

base as I think it does not make economic sense for pension

7

and life insurance benefits.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. HOROWITZ:

How should we treat it then?
Well, I think there has to be a general

10

rule for the totality of cases.

11

there is a slight under-recovery by the claimant because in

12

some cases there may be medical insurance that she perhaps

13

should get credit for or whether there is going to be a very

14

significant under-recovery because a lot of fringe benefits

15

are going to be lumped in that make no economic sense.

16

the Court has to follow, I think, what is the best reading of

17

the statutory definition and not include these benefits.

And, if the question is whether

I think

18

Now, the fact that there is some need to pay for

19

medical insurance may be something that Congress took into

20

account in setting the percentages of wages that the employees

21

are actually going to receive for benefits.

No, they don't make the distinction in

there is such a distinction; namely, it is a death benefit

13

under Section 9 of the: Act.

The principle is exactly the same.

I mean,

if we were to affirm, you would have exactly the same calcul­

Well, let me put it this way.

that the fact they are calculated in much the same way is the

overruling factor but we must remember, as in the Potomac case

Would you say that would be —

MR. LEONARD:

The answer is, yes, they could because,

20

number one, in the case that you decided in January of this

year, the Bowen case, you held that a negotiated contract such

Yes, I think it definitely should be

It is to be sure that the compensation paid

by the government contractors is as high as the local prevailing

Correct, for that purpose.

MR. LEONARD:

Well, at least as high then would include

the fringe benefits.

12

16

The statute requires that they pay at

least as high, wages at least as high as the prevailing —

10

11

I don't believe that

Correct.

Yes.

MR. LEONARD:

Now, I am clear that the employer pay­

ments to unions is part of the statutory language.

I am clear

that these are to be counted in and I quote, "adjusting
compensation for injuries" from the statute.

That is 40 USC

276 (a) .
Let's take the Federal Employees Compensation Act
because this is a rather remarkable parallel.

Assuming that

Congress doesn't particularly want to distinguish between the
two, which it might well do, we take Section 8171 of the Federal
Employees Compensation Act — that is Title

5,

81 — starting

at 8114 — and that applies to non-appropriated fund activities.

1

Now, remember, these are civilian people and they are brought

under this Act we are now talking about, the Longshoremen's

3

and Harbor Workers' Act.

4

in the Federal Employees Compensation Act this covers non-

5

appropriated fund activities and their personnel come under

6

workers' compensation.

7

In other words, Congress is saying

Let's take the Miller Act.

This I can't go very far

8

because of your statement before, Mr. Justice Stevens, because

9

these are sums justly due the employees, because that is exactly

10

what you said and there is no point in going into it.

MR. LEONARD:

I am not sure.

I think I was.
Let me go back for a moment to Davis-

23

Bacon as a matter of fact.

24

of these facts, we have a very curious happening in Davis-Bacon.

25

Remember, you were told that the amendment to this Act went back

Act and, therefore, supplemented it in 1964, almost 20 years ago

7

which shows that Congress is really not behind the times.

It was never amended.

that leads, of course, to the Labor Management Relations Act

which created employee trusts.

12

the unions on these funds to the extent that it created the

13

trust form of handling, gave the right to the union and to the

14

individual to make sure that the contributions were put into it.

15

And, in Section 17 of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers'

16

Compensation Act it is provided that whatever you have received

17

from one of the union benefit plans you may have to return if

18

you get workmen's compensation.

20

Apparently Congress distrusted

You may have to put it back

Now, nothing, I think, could be clearer than to show

21

that what is paid into these trusts, if paid out without

compensation, must be put back if you get compensation.

interrelationship of the two is fascinating.

exempts government retirement funds from tax.

passed a law, as you probably know, in the Economic Recovery
