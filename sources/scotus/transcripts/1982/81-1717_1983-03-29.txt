ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN S.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

SLOMAN, ESQ.,

MR. SLOMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

11

This case involves a state property tax on the

12

shares of state and national banks, authorized by Texas

13

statute but imposed and calculated by local taxing

14

authorities.

15

have paid the taxes as agents for the shareholders and

16

they and the shareholders seek to have the tax

17

assessment declared to be in violation of Revised

18

Statutes Section 3701 as amended in

19

every form of taxation that considers United States

20

obligations in the computation of the tax.

In the case before the Court the banks

1959 to prohibit

21

The Respondents calculated the taxable value

22

of the shares of each bank according to the bank's net

23

worth.

24

page 183, by taking the total assets of the bank other

25

than real estate, which is taxed separately to the bank

That is, as the court below put it at Appendix

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST,, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

itself, and deducting the bank's liabilities, to come up

2

with a net worth or equity capital or a number of names

3

as it's known on call statements, financial statements

4

or the taxing authorities, but in an accounting sense it

5

is the net worth, the assets less the liabilities other

6

than real estate.

7

Mow, among those assets were various amounts

8

of United States obligations that went into that net

9

worth that was used to determine the taxable value of

10

the shares.

11

thereby "considered" United States obligations in

12

computing the taxable value of the shares, in violation

3

Petitioners contend that Respondents

of Section 3701.

4

Thus, at the center of the case is the effect

5

of the word "considered" as used in that statute.

6

word is given no special definition in the statute.

7

Now, of course the word "consider" can be used in two

8

senses:

9

Respondents, and they repeatedly refer to the state of

20

mind of the tax assessors, refers to a subjective state

2

or a mental process inside the mind.

22

judgment" or "This Court considers a case for

23

decision."

24
25

The

One, which is the sense relied on by

"In my considered

But that sense of the word cannot be involved
here because the word as used in the statute is

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

addressed to and defines a prohibited form of taxation,

2

which is incapable of a mental process.

3

Another sense of the word "considers" deals

4

with an objective state of facts, which the statute

5

itself purports to do, as reflected in the dictionary

6

definition of "to take into account."

7

of relativity considers the effect of gravity on light

8

or takes into account the effect of gravity.

9

The general law

This is the meaning that makes sense in the

10

context of Section 3701, so that, substituting the

11

dictionary objective meaning, the statute prohibits

12

every form of taxation that takes into account United

13

States obligations in the computation of the tax.

14

this is the sense in which this Court and the Texas

15

courts and other authorities have described the

16

computation of a share tax measured by net assets that

17

included United States obligations.

18

And

For example, in Des Moines National Bank

19

against Fairweather, cited in our brief, this Court was

20

dealing with a share tax that was computed just exactly

21

like the one at bar.

22

United States obligations, less liabilities resulted in

23

a net worth that was the basis, the base for the tax.

24
25

That is, assets, which included

At that time Section 3701 was in the form
before the 1959 amendment and only prohibited taxes upon

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

United States obligations and not those which considered

2

United States obligations, and the Court upheld -the tax

3

without a deduction for United States obligations on the

4

familiar distinction that a tax upon a shareholder's

5

interest is not a tax upon the corporation or the

6

corporation's assets, even though, as this Court said in

7

describing the tax there, "controlling consideration" is

8

given to those assets in the computation of the tax.

9

The Court in its holding said Section 3701

10

left no authority for taxing a United States obligation

11

to the bank, to the bank itself, "but only for taking it

12

into account in valuing the shares of the

13

stockholders."

14

So that this Court in its description of this

15

very kind of tax recognized that the tax considers

16

United States obligations, takes them into account, but

17

under the former form of the statute that was

18

permissible because the tax was only upon United States

19

obligations, whereas since the 1959 amendment taxes are

20

prohibited, every form of tax that considers those

21

obligations.

22

He cite in our brief at page 14 Texas

23

authorities that have used similar language and a

24

similar approach in describing the very share tax that's

25

before this Court.

The assessment in the present cases

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

take into account the bank’s assets which include United

2

States obligations and therefore come squarely under the

3

statutory prohibition against considering United States

4

obligations in the computation of the tax.

5

Respondents, however, would read an implied

6

exception into the prohibition of the statute in spite

7

of its apparent application.

8

are foreclosed by two specific exemptions that the 1959

9

amendment itself provided from its expanded

10

But any implied exceptions

prohibition.

11

Under the pre-1959 version of Section 3701,

12

when only taxes upon United States obligations were

13

prohibited, this Court had upheld share taxes, as in Des

14

Koines against Fairweather and other cases, and it had

15

upheld franchise taxes, and it had upheld death taxes or

16

succession taxes, where the tax was measured by assets

17

that included United States obligations.

18

And in each of those cases, which are cited in

19

our brief and which cross-refer to one another — the

20

francise tax case refers to the share tax case, and so

21

forth — in each of those cases the tax was upheld

22

because it was not upon United States obligations by

23

which the tax was measured, but rather upon the

24

shareholders* interest or the franchise or the death

25

transfer.

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Now, when Section 3701 was amended by Congress

2

in 1959 into its present form, on which Petitioners rely

3

and which is before this Court, Congress specifically

4

excepted franchise taxes and specifically excepted death

5

taxes from the expanded prohibition of the tax.

QUESTION:

What about

gift taxes?

8
9

What about gift taxes?

MR. SLOMAN:

Gift taxes are not mentioned,

Your Honor.

10

QUESTION:

Well, what happens then?

Do we

11

have one rule for estate taxes and another rule for gift

12

taxes, even though they, in the old days anyway, used to

13

be inter-related?

14

MR. SLOMAN:

Certainly in the view of the

15

Solicitor General that’s so.

16

the case before the Court.

17

not being excepted from the statute, that they would be

18

cov ered.

19

No gifts are involved in
But it would appear that,

Now, having made no exception for any kind of

20

property tax, share taxes or otherwise, but having

21

excepted franchise taxes and death taxes, it would be

22

quite unwarranted to infer an exception or imply an

23

exception, as Respondents would do, for share taxes.

24

Respondents* several arguments end with Section 3701

25

having no substantive effect, at least as to banks.

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

But

1

the meaning of the statute is plain and its prohibition

2

is clear# irrespective of who owns the exempt

3

obligations.

5

I reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal,
Mr. Chief Justice.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Brown?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST J. BROWN, ESQ.

9

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

10
11

2

MR. BROWN:

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice and it it please

the Court:
I should like# on behalf of the United States,

3

to refer the Court particularly to the circumstances,

4

the background leading to the 1959 amendment, which is

5

of course central here.

6

circumstances one can conclude, in the terms used just

7

two months ago in the Memphis Bank opinion, that it can

8

be determined that this statute is another manifestation

9

of what the Court called the long-established

I think that in light of those

20

Congressional intent to prevent taxes which diminish in

21

the slightest degree the market value or the investment

22

attractiveness of obligations of the United States.

23

The lagislation resulted from a presidential

24

message, supported by an appearance of the Secretary of

25

the Treasury, before the Ways and Means Committee,

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

seeking what both called assistance in the management of

2

the national debt, assistance by lifting the debt

3

ceiling, by raising the interest ceiling, or I should

4

say removing the interest ceiling, which was then 3.26

5

percent on savings bonds and — the figure seems strange

6

to us today — 4.25 percent on obligations of a maturity

7

of more than five years.

8

9

The Secretary told the Committee that the
Treasury was unable to market 4.25 percent bonds and so

10

was necessarily financing the Government on very

11

short-term obligations and Treasury bills.

12

was what both the President and the Secretary referred

13

to as other technical assistance, and that of course is

14

what is referred to here in the exemption, or the

15

further exemption or to clarify the exemption, of

16

national obligations. Government bonds.

17

Also asked

The Congress did lift the debt ceiling.

It

18

did increase the savings bond ceiling.

19

after extended discussion of interest rates, whether

20

they were inflationary or not -- some of them have echos

21

even today, of whether higher interest causes inflation

22

or inflation causes higher interest — but it did not.

23

So it was the more important that the impact

But it did not,

24

of state taxes on the federal bonds be carefully

25

observed.

Both the President and the Secretary informed

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the Congress that the state obligations had a very

2

highly preferential position.

3

than, as some think them now, and the state exemption

4

made them very attractive, highly marketable.

5

Federal taxes were high

As a matter of fact, the Secretary informed

6

the Committee that state obligations in the 12 postwar

7

years had increased from $16 billion to $59 billion,

8

which led to strenuous competition for the federal

9

obligations in the market.

10

The Secretary used as an illustration to the

11

Committee an Idaho tax which was in force seeking to

12

reach interest on Government bonds.

13

was the tax was on the individual, measured by the

14

interest on the bonds.

15

QUESTIONS

The justification

Mr. Brown, let me interrupt you

16

right there, because that Idaho example raised a

17

question in my mind.

18

that was subjected to a state income tax and some of its

19

income was derived from income on Government bonds.

20

Would the dividend income of that corporation be exempt

21

from tax to the extent that it reflected interest on

22

Government bonds?

23
24
25

MR. BROWNs

Supposing you had a corporation

The dividends distributed by the

corporation —
QUESTION:

To the shareholders, yes.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. BROWN*

2

QUESTION;

No, Justice Stevens.
Why wouldn't that be indirectly a

3

tax on income, just as the tax on value of the shares is

4

a tax on the underlying Government bond?

5

MR. BROWN*

Well, it hasn't been thus far.

6

The regulations under Section 312 of the Internal

7

Revenue Code say that it doesn't carry over.

8

quote Justice Holmes in Miller and Milwaukee saying that

9

the corporation is usually an insulator which separates

10

the nature of the corporate income.

11
12

QUESTION;

MR. BROWN*

Well, no — yes, after the statute

I am arguing that it's not.

15
16

But in this case you're arguing the

corporation is not an insulator.

13
14

I may

QUESTION;

That it's an insulator for income

purposes, but not for asset purposes.

17

MR. BROWN*

Well, I don't know that I would

18

make that classification if it’s not essential here.

19

But I would like to point out that I think

20

what's central here is not the insulation, but the use

21

of the "or measured by” device, which has been

22

frequently used in taxes, sometimes with unpredictable

23

results.

24

an example, but perhaps a better example would have been

25

the case decided by this Court just four years before,

Justice Harlan — the Idaho case was used as

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the Cleveland case. Society for Savings, where the tax

2

on financial institutions was on their capital and

3

surplus.

4

But the Ohio court said, though this was a

5

mutual savings bank, that the tax was on the interest of

6

the depositors, measured by the assets of the bank.

7

This Court did not agree.

8

that at times it was very hard to distinguish for

9

practical purposes. Justice Stevens, the difference

Justice Harlan pointed out

10

between a tax on the assets and a tax on the shares when

11

the tax on the shares was "computed by.”

2

3

So this "measured by" device which didn’t
succeed there sometimes does.

4

It's hard to predict.

I might mention that just six months before

5

this statute this Court held that a Virginia tax on the

6

assets, what purported to be a property tax, could be

7

measured by gross receipts, though Justice Brennan

8

pointed out in a separate opinion that if it were

9

measured by the property it would come to $7,000; on

20

gross receipts it came to £126,000.
In any event, the Treasury in this case

2
22

thought it would do away with this "measured by"

23

device.

QUESTION;

24
25

So it —

you.

Mr. Brown, let me be sure I follow

I take it you feel that the amendment to 3701

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

broadened the exemption on Federal --?

2

MR. BROWN;

3

QUESTION;

4
5

Yes, I do, I do.
And intentionally so on the part of

Congress?
NR. BROWN;

Yes, I feel that’s clear.

Some

6

people thought maybe the earlier statement was more

7

universal than its application warranted, and they may

8

have referred to clarification.

9

be justified when you looked at the decisions.

10

But that would hardly

So this statute then, I take it, eliminates

11

any computation, and in my view the word "computation"

12

is the operative word here, which takes into account,

13

reaches directly or indirectly the bonds of the Federal

14

Government or the income from those bonds.

15

clear that in this case the computation, as in the

16

Georgia case which is pending, did include those bonds.

17

And it is

I would like to turn briefly, if I may, also

18

to one other federal statute much relied on below, Rev.

19

Stat. 5219,

20

saying there could be taxes on these shares.

Well, no

21

one disputes that the shares could be taxed.

This Court

22

said so in M'Culloch and Maryland.

23

Act said nothing in this statute shall prohibit it.

24
25

a later version, which is relied on as

The National Bank

What is objected to here is the method, and
certainly that is subject to objection.

If I may take

1

the Memphis case, in this context suppose this property

2

tax had included the federal bonds but excluded the

3

state bonds.

4

been as discriminatory there on the property, on the

5

share, as it was held, a somewhat different tax, was

6

held to be discriminatory two months ago in the Memphis

7

case.

8
9

I take it that the share tax would have

So I think that 5219 has no bearing on this
case at all.

It is certainly not carte blanche to tax

10

the shares of a bank or any other corporation which is

11

equally involved in this case, may be equally involved

12

in this case, in any fashion that is desired.

13

So it seems to me that it*s quite clear, and

14

the background in Congress makes it clear, that this

15

statute meant to eliminate computation of estate tax,

16

any form of tax, which directly or indirectly used the

17

value or the income from Government obligations.

18

that's all this case is.

19

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARROLL R. GRAHAM, ESQ.

23

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

24
25

MR. GRAHAM:

And

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

The National Banking Act of 1864 authorized

2

the tax in question, and that point was litigated in

3

1866 very thoroughly in Van Ness versus The Assessors.

4

Van Ness points out that there were two bases for the

5

application of the tax, two prongs for it:

6

Number one. Congress said that you could tax

7

the shares of national banks; and number two, there was

8

no limitation to exclude any part of the value of the

9

shares.

And Van Ness versus The Assessors,

1866, held

10

that, number one, you could tax the shares of national

11

banks; and number two, you did not have to deduct the

12

value of the federal obligations owned by the bank.

13

This situation remained throughout the years

14

and every case which came to this Court prior to '59

15

upheld the true share tax, but did not uphold the taxes

16

where they tried to levy on the bank itself rather than

17

the shareholders.

18

That problem does not exist with the Texas

19

statute, as it clearly levies the tax on the

20

shareholders, and there is no legal obligation upon the

21

bank to pay any part of the share tax.

22
23

QUESTION:

You say prior to *59 the tax would

unquestionably have been upheld?

24

MR. GRAHAM:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
And you don’t think anything

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

changed that in

'59?

2

HR. GRAHAM;

3

The point I’m trying to draw is that in 1959

No.

No, I syre don’t.

4

for 95 years — for 93 years it had been settled law

5

that national banks and state banks could be taxed on

6

their shares, and that it was not necessary to deduct

7

the value of federal obligations, because under the Van

8

Ness holding when Congress authorized the taxing of the

9

shares it authorized the taxing of the full value of the

10

shares.

11

respectfully submit, was not changed at all.

12

And that position existed in 1959 and, we

law was not touched.

That was Revised Statute 5219.

It

It was on the

It was not touched by Congress in any

It’s our position that the modification or the

17
18

codification of the exemption statute, 3701, did not in

19

any way apply to or control or reflect upon the taxation

20

of the national bank shares.

21

QUESTION;

You would concede, wouldn't you,

22

you’d rather have the Government’s case after *59 than

23

before?

24
25

MR. GRAHAM;

No, sir.

No, sir.

In 1959,

after the modification of 3701 with the addition of the

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

second sentence, the Bank Act still provided for

2

taxation of bank shares in the same manner in w-hich

3

they're being taxed today, the same provision that the

4

shares could be taxed, and there's never been any

5

modification by the Congress of the definition of

6

"shares" or in any manner changed the definition that

7

was laid down in Van Ness.

QUESTION;

Do you think the '59 amendment

invalidated any tax that would have been valid before?

No, but if a state sought to impose

MR. LUNAi

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Courts
This Court recently recognized in the

22

Tennessee case the fact that the statute that we have

23

here today, 31 742, principally restates the

24

constitutional rule that we have had since M'Culloch

25

versus Maryland.

And in that Memphis Bank case the

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Court pointed out very clearly that where the legal

2

incidence of the tax falls on the separate property

3

interest of the stockholder or some other person other

4

than the Government or the owner of the bonds itself,

5

that unless there is a discrimination between the

6

national — the taxation as to the federal securities

7

and others, that it didn't violate 31 U.S.C. 742.

8

9

Now, there is no contention in this case as it
is before the Court at this time that there is any

10

discrimination on federal securities versus any other

11

type securities, such as there was in the Tennessee

12

case.

provision — that statutory provision, as late as the

14

Memphis case the Court has said it does not affect this

kind of a transaction.

Now, I think that takes us, if we go all the

17

way back to the two questions or the two reasons that

18

were raised actually in the Van Allen case, the court in

19

Texas, our Chief Justice Guittard, I think pointed out

20

very carefully that there were two grounds that were

21

mentioned in the Van Allen case, either one of which

22

were sufficient to sustain our tax.

23

Now, the court pointed out first that there

24

was a distinction between taxation of the shares and

25

taxation of bank assets, and I think that is this

All of these cases have said that they can't

22

be taxed directly or indirectly.

But at the same time

23

that the courts were saying they can’t be taxed directly

24

or indirectly, the court also said that a tax on the

25

stockholder is not a tax on a bank.

24
ALDERS0N REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Now, at some stages of this litigation the

2

banks have said, but we paid the tax actually, and of

3

course the reason they did that is because of another

4

federal statute that permits them to pay the tax for the

5

stockholder and that the bank can deduct it if the

6

stockholder doesn't deduct it himself, which really

7

makes it not material at all to the questions that we

8

have here.

9

Now, we believe then that if we were to follow

10

the view that the banks have propounded here today, that

11

it would indeed mean that any corporation which owns

12

federal securities, you would have to subtract that

13

stock or those bonds and federal securities from the

14

value of the stock before you could tax it.

15

of fact, in one of the footnotes in our brief we point

16

out that there are about 20-something states who tax

17

either corporate stock in corporations generally or bank

18

stock or both.

As a matter

Now, in Texas that question is not material

19
20

because we do not tax the corporate stock in other types

21

of corporations, only banks.

22

mentioned in one of its opinions, if that should be —

23

if we should have to deduct it in all cases, it would be

24

nothing but chaos in the taxing systems of the various

25

sta tes.

But as this Court

25

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Now, there is nothing in 31 U.S.C. 742 as

4

Congressional history.

Section

And he pointed out in his statement, which we

12

quote at length in our brief, that it was -- that they

13

believed that Idaho was wrong, but that this seemed to

14

be the easiest way to clarify the problem, and therefore

15

he recommended that Congress pass 105, Section 105 of

16

that bill, in order to clarify the situation that they

17

had as to Idaho.

18

had before the Congress at that time insofar as reasons

19

as to why that statute ought to be amended in that

20

particular.

21

And that was the only thing that we

Now, the Petitioners say that we shouldn't

22

take into consideration in thinking about statutes

23

anything subjective, that it’s all objective.

24

unless we look at it subjective we don’t get to the

25

question here, because our state statute simply says

Now,

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

that the value of stock, the bank stock, shall be

2

assessed at its cash value less the value of the real

3

estate which may be taxed separately.

4

So our statute just talks about cash value.

5

It doesn't say anything about the things we have here.

6

Now, as a measuring stick of cash value we might use

7

several things.

9

were getting when they were selling the stock down at

So they're really arguing about our formula,

14

not that we taxed the bank too high, the stock too

15

high.

16

based on equity capital and not on what it was selling

17

for at the marketplace, they wound up paying less tax

18

than they would otherwise have paid.

19

So they say, if they use our formula, which was

Are they injured?

Is there harm?

And when

20

one is challenging a statute, doesn't he have the burden

21

of proving that there has been some harm?

22

that has not been shown in this case.

23

that has been shown is that by using the formula with

13

hearings of Congress they would have overruled almost

14

100 years of cases of this Court and never told anybody

15

that's what they were doing.

16

history was going on they said that, we're doing it in

21

and that is the only thing that there is in the

Congressional history.

23

if Congress were to overrule that many cases of this
