ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION
MR. LEEi

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety

13
14

Act of 1966 directs the Secretary of Transportation to

15

issue appropriate federal motor vehicle safety standards

16

which shall be practicable, shall meet the need for

17

safety, and shall be stated in objective terms.
Over the 17 years since that statute was

18
19

enacted, a succession of Transportation Secretaries have

20

tried to find the best way to implement its broad

21

authority.

22

occupant crash protection has been particularly

23

elusive.

24
25

The optimum solution to the problem of

Since 1967 standard 208, which deals with the
problem of occupant crash protection, has required the

2

which require no independent occupant action for their

3

effectiveness, were first incorporated into standard 208

4

in a series of amendments adopted between 1970 and

5

1972.

6

Passive restraints,

One of the permitted options under those

7

amendments was a manual belt system coupled with an

8

ignition interlock.

9

interlock systems led Congress in 1974 to prohibit them

10
11

However, public irritation with

by statute.
In 1976 Secretary Coleman attempted to deal

12

with what he considered to be the root of the problem:

13

widespread public resistance to mandatory passive

14

restraints.

15

involving up to 500,000 cars installed with passive

16

restraints in order to smooth the way for their public

17

acceptance at a later date.

18

He proposed a demonstration project

Secretary Coleman did not reject mandatory

19

passive restraints as a long-range solution.

20

concluded that they would be more effective if preceded

21

in time by an effort to change the public's attitude

22

about them.

23

He simply

His successor disagreed, as was, in our view,

24

his prerogative.

Within a manner of months, Secretary

25

Adams dispensed with the Coleman demonstration project

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and instead adopted the modified standard 208 at issue

2

here, which made passive restraints mandatory for large

3

cars beginning with the 1982 model year and all cars

4

beginning with the 1984 model year.
Hhile it permitted manufacturers to choose

5

6

between two basic systems, air bags or passive belts, it

7

was assumed at that time that about 60 percent of the

8

cars would be equipped with air bags.

9

Four years after the Adams decision, Secretary

10

Lewis rescinded the mandatory passive restraint features

11

of standard 208.

12

findings s

He based his decisions on three

First, that because of the intervening to

13
14

small cars, not one percent — not 60 percent, but only

15

one percent of all cars would be equipped with air

16

bags ;

17

Second, that in complying then with standard

18

208 as it then stood, the seat belts that would be

19

installed in the overwhelming majority of new cars would

20

be detachable, and that once detached would be the

21

functional equivalent of manual belts;

22

And third, that there was substantial

23

uncertainty about the usage rate of these detachable

24

belts convertible to manual belts.

25

Under those circumstances, NHTSA could not

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

reliably predict whether increased use because of

2

detachable belts would fall closer to zero percent or

3

closer to five percent or ten percent, and for those

4

reasons, together with the possible adverse safety

5

effects from public reaction to what the public might

6

perceive to be another expensive example of ineffective

7

regulation, the agency could not conclude that the

8

automatic restraints as then stated met the need for

9

safety.

10

The Court of Appeals took no issue with the

11

first two of these findings.

12

reasonable.

13

question on its head.

14

issue of probable seat belt usage was one which no one

15

could predict with certainty.

16

that once the agency had selected the passive restraint

17

course of action in 1977, the presumption no longer ran

18

in favor of the agency judgment, but rather in favor of

19

the very regulation which the agency had concluded did

20

not meet the statutory objectives.

21

It described them as

But it said that the third step turned the
The court conceded the factual

Nevertheless, it held

The effect of this unprecedented holding is

22

truly starting.

It effectively deprives an

23

administrative agency of its authority to regulate in

24

conditions of uncertainty by making predictive judgments

25

to resolve that uncertainty, judgments which in many

1

cases, including this one, lie at the very heart of the

2

administrative process.

3

3y definition, where predictive judgments must

4

be made in uncertain conditions, as they must here, the

5

location of the burden will usually be determinative.

6

This case illustrates the mischief of shifting that

7

burden once the agency proposes a regulation, and here

8

is the reason why.

9

There are several views concerning which path

10

leads to the best occupant restraint system.

11

17 years that Secretaries of Transportation have

12

struggled with that problem, there have been two major,

13

enduring, and overarching issues.

14

Over the

restraint system really be.

consist of easily detachable belts, and Secretary Lewis

21

concluded that under those new circumstance the

22

requirements created by standard 208 as it then stood

23

would not be effective.

Secretary Adams in 1977

By 1981 the circumstances had changed

It was clear that compliance would

There has always been a second broad issue,
separate and very important.

And it is;

Assuming that

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

there is to be a passive restraint requirement at some

2

point in time, which of two possible approaches should

3

the agency emphasize first in time?

4

first with hardware requirements or do you emphasize

5

first changes in public attitude?

6

Do you push ahead

The right answers to those two controlling

7

questions depend on the resolution of multiple

8

uncertainties, technological uncertainties and

9

behavioral uncertainties.

Someone has to perform the

10

necessary task of sorting out those uncertainties,

11

balancing the relevant considerations on all sides, and

12

then making a judgment concerning which alternatives

13

ought to be pursued and in what order.

14

It is equally clear, I submit, that that job,

15

making predictive judgments in conditions of

16

uncertainty, belongs to the administrative agency.

Standard 238 has been in existence since 1967.

18

been amended many times.

19

evolving experimental administrative efforts and

20

continuing efforts by the Courts of Appeals for the

21

Sixth Circuit and also for the District of Columbia,

22

there is nothing in law and nothing in common sense that

23

suggests that that evolution should be frozen as of the

24

1977 amendment.

25

It's

best way to implement the statute was to attempt first

2

to change human attitudes.

3

best solution?

4

what ought to be clear to everyone, I submit, is that

5

the Coleman choice of alternative did not preclude

6

Secretary Adams from choosing another alternative

7

without first bearing the probably impossible burden of

8

disproving the predictive assumptions underlying the

9

Coleman decision.

Was he right?

Was that the

Reasonable persons will differ.

Lewis did not rule out the possibility of active

restraints as a long-range solution.

All options are still open.

QUESTION*

14

All options are

Hr. Lee, may I ask you one

15

question.

Is it your view that the standard to be

16

applied in deciding whether a rescission was proper is

17

the same as the standard to be applied in whether or not

18

to adopt a regulation in the first instance?
HR. LEE;

19

Mr. Answer, Justice Stevens, is yes,

20

they're very close, but I need to modify it in this one

21

way.

22

is it arbitrary and capricious.

23

that have been handed down from this Court, it requires

24

that the agency take into account and make its

25

predictive judgments concerning all the information it

The standard is arbitrariness and capriciousness,
And as I read the cases

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

has before it
Now, in the coarse of having explored one

2
3

path, there will be some information that the agency has

4

to take into account, and it must take that into

5

account.

6

one, it's still the arbitrary and capricious standard.

7

It's a question of whether they've acted irrationally,

8

and the presumption still runs in favor of the propriety

9

of agency action.

10

But at the end of the day, two thingss

Number

And second, in the great majority of

11

instances, and certainly I would say in this one, the

12

standard will be about the same for not adopting a

13

regulation in the first place or rescinding one.

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. LEE:

16
17

About the same?
Well, it’s always governed by the

arbitrary and capricious standard.
QUESTION:

I understand that.

Really what I'm

18

asking you is, do you think the Secretary has the same

19

latitude in rescinding, just the same broad — in

20

rescinding this regulation, as he would have had in

21

deciding whether or not to put it into effect in the

22

first place?

23

MR. LEE:

Yes, except that if in the process

24

of enacting — of considering the regulation in the

25

first place he has information that has come before him,

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

he does have the obligation to take that information

2

into account.

3

another kind of context, he would still, of course, have

4

that obligation to take that into account.
QUESTION;

6

ME. LEE;

QUESTION;

MR. LEE;

I think in the overwhelming majority

and maybe always, it will be the same standard, yes.

ME. LEE:

QUESTION;

17

findings at all?

18

February.

20

Do you think he had to make any

findings at all?

15

19

Then you really are saying it's the

same standard, I think.

11
12

Anything that comes before him, of

course.

9
10

Wouldn't he in promulgating a

regulation have an obligation to take into account —

7
8

Now, if it had been presented to him in

Excuse me?
Do you think he had to make any

What if he’d done what he did in

Would that have been lawful?
ME. LEE:

I would certainly still have

defended what he did.

21

QUESTION;

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. LEE:

24
25

*
Well,

I understand that, but --

Though not under all circumstances

will I defend what he did.
But it would have made my case perhaps more

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

difficult, but I think you would still look to see

2

whether an objective Secretary of Transportation, acting

3

under all of the facts and circumstances that were then

4

before him, acted arbitrary and capriciously.

5

would say, yes, that while we would have a less adequate

6

explanation as to why, it would still be not arbitrary

7

or capricious.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION;

And I

On that same point, is the agency

required to articulate facts which will rationally
support a decision?
ER. LEE;

I would have to say that if the

12

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in an

13

earlier phase of this very litigation is correct, the

14

answer to that question is no.

15

Foundation case, the question was did Secretary Adams in

16

his 1977 decision have to take into account probable

17

public reaction.

18

did have to take it into account.

19

said it was not important to take it into account.

20

court nevertheless held that it was reasonable.

6

instance under the arbitrary and capricious standard.
QUESTION*

7

Needless to

I do not think that it is a

Has it necessary in this instance

8

for the Secretary.to consider not only whether the

9

detachable belt option was ineffective, but also whether

10

it would be appropriate to require non-detachable belts

11

or whether it would be appropriate to require the air

12

bag approach, the other options?
NR. LEE:

13

The answer is no.

The answer is no,

14

and the reason is this.

15

the contrary that there was the obligation to consider

16

these other alternatives — and incidentally, the

17

details of those alternatives will be discussed more

18

thoroughly by Hr. Cutler -- rests on the Court of

19

Appeals' assumption that passive restraints are required

20

by the statute, So that if detachable belts wouldn't do,

21

then the court has -- then the agency has an obligation

22

to go on and consider some other form of passive

23

restraint.

24
25

The Court of Appeals holding to

In fact, it is clear that the statute has
never required passive restraints.

The only source in

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

law which ever provided for passive restraints is an

2

agency regulation, and the agency has statutory

3

authority to revoke its own regulations.

4

The only Congressional mandate is to enact

5

regulations which are practical, meet the need for

6

safety, and are stated in objective terms.

7

leaves a very broad leeway to the administrative agency

8

as to the kinds of standards to adopt in implementation

9

of that broad standard, and that includes the time order

And that

10

according to which either one alternative will be

11

considered, and none has been foreclosed by what

12

Secretary Lewis has done.

13

Mow let me make one final point, and it bears.

14

Justice O'Connor, on this emphasis on alternatives.

15

one thing that that emphasis on alternatives that is

16

made both by the Court of Appeals and also the

17

Respondents bears out is that it really underscores and

18

confirms the fact that the situation as it stood in 1981

19

was not satisfactory, and that the Secretary was quite

20

right not to let it simply drift.

21

The

The telling fact is that by 1981 it was clear

22

that the 1977 assumption was wrong, standard 208 as then

23

written was not going to do the job, and under those

24

circumstances it was not irrational for the Secretary to

25

rescind, and that is all that he did.

MR. CUTLER;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I will cover the second ground of the Court of

24

Appeals decision to set aside the agency’s action.

25

Before doing so, I'd like to supplement the Solicitor

1

General's response to Justice Stevens and Justice

2

O'Connor by saying that if there was any obligation on

3

the agency to explain its conduct, its decision, it was

4

an obligation to give reasons.
Those reasons did not have to be facts.

5

They

6

could just as well be statements of uncertainties about

7

facts, particularly facts that went to the agency’s own

8

predictive judgment.

9

they had merely to conclude that they faced

They didn't have to find facts;

10

uncertainties about their predictive judgments, in order

11

to rescind the standard.
As to the issue of alternatives, a majority of

12
13

the court ruled that the passive restraint requirement

14

was not justified -- a majority of the court ruled that

15

even if the passive restraint requirement was not

16

justified as written, the agency should have considered

17

other alternative versions before rescinding this one.

18

And the majority discussed three such alternativess
One was requiring that if passive belts were

19

20

used to comply they be continuous rather than

21

detachable;
Second, requiring compliance by air bags

22
23
24
25

only;
And third, reviving Secretary Coleman's
voluntary demonstration program.

the agency's April 1981 notice of proposed rulemaking

that ended with the rescission.

4

comments on a number of alternative actions, but those

did not include the ones advanced by the Court of

Appeals.

7

That notice did request

And under those circumstances, we submit it

would have been improper for the agency to adopt any of

the different proposals later advanced by the Court of

Appeals before issuing a further notice and providing

11

opportunity for comment.

12

court should not have reordered the agency's own

13

priorities so as to require it to consider other

14

alternatives before rescinding this prospective

15

regulation rather than after doing so, as the agency has

said it would do.

17

And we submit further that the

And even if it would be appropriate for a

18

court to remand in some circumstances because an agency

19

had failed to consider other alternatives, we would

20

submit that those circumstances do not exist here.

21

The Court of Appeals relied primarily on the

22

alternative of the non-detachable passive belt,

23

sometimes called in these statements in briefs the

24

continuous passive belt.

25

one that the agency did consider fully in the decision

under review, and its reasons for rejecting it were

2

rational, convincing ani plainly within its expert

3

discretion in applying the statutory criteria.
These reasons were the safety need for easy

4
5

emergency egress, the public fear of entrapment by

6

attached belts in a crash, and public and Congressional

7

resistance to use-compelling features in passive

8

restraint systems.
And both the Respondents and, we submit, the

9
10

Court of Appeals were wrong to suggest that the

11

non-detachable belt, so-called, was an obvious

12

alternative that hai already been proven acceptable to

13

the public in practice and had clearly increased belt

14

usa ge.

15

Until 1978 this very standard reguired that if

16

a passive belt system were used the belt must be readily

17

detachable by the passenger to permit escape in an

18

emergency, for example a crash in which the door

19

anchoring the belt mechanism could not be opened, or a

20

turnover.

21

In '78 GK obtained agency approval to

22

experiment with continuous spool-release passive

23

shoulder belts and they equipped the 1980 Chevette with

24

a three-point spool-release belt as a customer option.

25

But it proved unpopular with the public, despite a

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

million dollar advertising campaign.

Only 13,000 were

2

sold out of over 400,000 Chevettes -- that is about

3

three percent -- even though the option was offered for

4

most of the time without charge and salesmen were

5

offered a $25 bonus if they could persuade a customer to

6

take one.
Moreover, that 1980 Chevette belt was in fact

7

8

detachable to simplify emergency egress, and if you look

9

at the drawing of the belt, which is at — it's GM*s

10

drawing at page 2A of the appendix to the NAII brief —

11

it's the red brief, Justice Stevens — you will see that

12

where the lap portion attaches to the lower door there

13

is a detachable pushbutton buckle, and when it's

14

detached the entire three-point belt goes slack.

15

shoulder portion stays in place and annoys the occupant,

16

but the system as a whole is inoperable, either as a

17

shoulder belt or a three-point belt, until it's

18

rea ttached.

The

19

20

acceptability and usage of only three passive belt

21

systems.

22

there's the '78 and

23

which had a shoulder belt system only, protected by an

24

ignition interlock, and as the Solicitor General has

25

said, public annoyance with that interlock in '78 had

There's this 1980 Chevette I just mentioned,

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

driven Congress to forbid the agency from requiring --

2

from issuing any standard that required or permitted the

3

use of an ignition interlock..
So that option was just not available to the

4
5

agency.

Even though ignition interlocks did

6

substantially increase belt usage even for active belts

7

in the ,74-*75 period and for passive belts, it's just

8

not an option that Congress has permitted the agency to

9

use.

10

In addition, it’s important to note, as the

11

agency did, that there is an important self-selection

12

factor that explains the high usage rates of these

13

passive belt systems guarded by interlocks or otherwise,

14

and that is these customers voluntarily chose cars with

15

passive belt systems when they had a choice.

16

substantial number of those customers found ways to

17

disarm the belt system afterward, and in the case of the

18

Chevette 1980 more than half of the customers, according

19

to a telephone survey cited by NAII, said they would not

20

buy that same system again.

21

Even so, a

Let me turn briefly to the alternative of

22

requiring compliance by air bags only.

The agency has

repeatedly found that a substantial part of the driving

Congressional veto procedure.

It was reflected in

resistance to the air bag that led him to defer any

mandatory passive restraint regulation until after a

the essence of that plan was voluntariness.

It

standard.

this present regulation, which would have frustrated any

15

Coleman plan and which also would have resulted in 99

percent of the cars having detachable passive belts

rather than air bags.

It turns on the Auto Safety Act, which directs

19

DOT to promulgate standards to protect the motoring

20

public against unreasonable risk of death or injury, and

21

DOT did promulgate such a regulation to require the

22

installation of passive restraints to provide protection

23

against death and injury.

24
25

Now, in anticipation of this rule two types of
passive restraints have been developed and installed,

24

Now, NHTSA*s own studies reflect that these

So you have that --

Excuse me, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

Was

there any comparative study made of the diminution of

comparison made with the seat belts?

2

US. FITZPATRICK;

No, I don't think DOT has

3

done that.

DOT has had no question, as far as we can

4

tell, ever that these automatic seat belts will have a

5

very high usage rate and will avoid significant numbers

6

of deaths and injuries.
QUESTION:

result by a 55 mile an hour speed limit enf orced.
MR. FITZPATRICK;

I don ’ t think

there’s any suggestion on this record -QUESTION;

13

Clearly not.'

When you say "clearly not,” what

study?
MR. FITZPATRICK;

I don't believe that there

15

is a study that has suggested that.

16

been any argument made by the agency itself in the

17

consideration of its rulemaking that would suggest that

18

an alternative of a 55 mile an hour speed 1 imit, as

19

useful as it might be, would be a response to the

20

problems of head-on crashes.

21

But th ere has never

A head-on crash at 5d miles an ho ur is a

22

dreadful event, and one would want to avoid through the

23

use of passive restraints the death and inj ury that

comes from crashes at 20, 30, U0 and 50 mil es an hour.

25

QUESTION;

Mr. Fitzpatrick.

1

MR. FITZPATRICK;

2

QUESTION;

Yes.

How does the safety ani utility of

3

the passive belts that you were describing a moment ago

4

bear on the Secretary's decision to resind the order

5

about air bags?
MR. FITZPATRICK;

6

Well, the Secretary decided

7

to rescind the passive restraint standard which

8

permitted compliance by two technologies; either the

9

automatic belt, which has been found to have high usage

10

rates; or an air bag, which the agency itself has

11

concluded is sound and effective.
So what the Secretary is doing is rejecting

12
13

technology,

work .

Well, but that's really just

arguing with the facts.

the Secretary.

7

MR. FITZPATRICK;

That's up to

Well, that's up in the first

8

instance to the Secretary, with the Court of Appeals in

9

the first instance looking to see whether there was

10

appropriate review.

11

to decide which works.

12

Rut it's quite true, you don't have

lou take the agency with the facts as they

13

found them.

14

and they found that this new CM belt, this fully

15

detachable belt, doesn't work.

16

sitting as a tryer or a weigher of facts.

17

They found that automatic belts do work,

You are not, of course,

You are taking, we would respectfully suggest,

18

the findings as the agency has made them and those

19

findings lead you to the conclusion that the Secretary

20

has rejected this standard in the face of two

21

technologies that have been proven effective, simply on

22

the grounds that the industry has come forward with a

23

technology that has been designed not to work in terms

24

of its safety obligations.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Fitzpatrick, you said that they

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

found that the new belt would not work.

2

that's right.

3

work.

They found if it's detached it would not

4

MR. FITZPATRICK:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

I don't think

That's correct.

They really didn't make a finding

on how often it would be detached.
MR. FITZPATRICK:

That is quite correct.

The

8

finding of the Court of Appeals — and one should be

9

precise about this -- the second finding of the Court of

10

Appeals was that once detached the belt is functionally

11

identical to the old buckle-up belt.

12

But they also said, once attached or kept

13

attached, it has the same characteristics of an

14

automatic belt, and it is somewhat shading to say that

15

the Court of Appeals said that the new detachable belt

16

was functionally identical.

17

They said that there's nothing in the record

18

here that indicates what the usage rates are going to

19

be, even with this new GM belt.

20

this juncture in the argument that even if the agency

21

was right that this GM belt was in fact a lemon as far

22

as safety is concerned, then it was arbitrary and

23

capricious under this statute to rescind the regulation

24

rather than to rule out a belt that doesn't work.

25

But our point is at

That, Your Honor, we believe is the only

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

course consistent with the Safety Act, which has said

2

that the actions of DOT have to have as their overriding

3

goal the promotion of safety.

4

the clear decision of the Congress that in 1966 the

5

control over the pace of safety progress was going to be

6

in the hands of DOT and not the industry.

And you have beyond that

Here, by permitting the industry to advance a

7

8

technology that doesn't work, you are shifting back to

9

the industry the authority to control the pace of safety

10

development.

Wa would suggest that nothing could be

11

more arbitrary in terms of the goals and obligations of

12

the Safety Act than to permit the industry itself to

13

meter the pace of safety progress.
QUESTION;

14

Well, who established the criteria

15

in the first place in your view?

16

criteria come from, Congress or the agency or some third

17

area?

18

ME. FITZPATRICK:

Where does the

Well, Congress clearly

19

stated an obligation that DOT was to promulgate

20

regulations which would lessen the unreasonable risk of

21

health and safety to American motorists.

So there was

22

an overarching Congressional obligation.

The agency

23

then promulgated a statute -- it promulgated a

24

regulation --

25

QUESTION:

While you're on that, on the first

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

step that you've just mentioned, is that any more than

2

saying to the agency, do something?

3

the agency any more than, do something about this

4

problem?

5

MR. FITZPATRICK:

Did Congress say to

Congress imposed -- Congress

6

did not — and we want to make this clear -- we have not

7

argued that Congress said to the agency, promulgate this

8

passive restraint regulation.

9

say, promulgate regulations that will foster the safety

10
11

What Congress did was to

of the motorists on the highway.
And the DOT did that, and our point is that

12

once one revokes, once one faces a revocation situation,

13

then there has to be support in the record for that

14

revocation decision.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

From our point of view —
You mean they have to prove they

have made a mistake?
MR. FITZPATRICK:

They don't have to prove

18

that they have to make a mistake.

However, a decision

19

to revoke and a decision to promulgate are both based

20

upon the same standard under the APA, and there has to

21

be some support for their decision to promulgate, there

22

has to be some support for their decision to revoke.

23

And the state of uncertainty is not an a priori state.

24

It is a condition that is based upon certain factors or

25

certain determinations of certain pieces of evidence

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

uncertainty.

Well, Mr. Fitzpatrick. —

QUESTION:

-- you say there has to be support

6

for a decision to promulgate in the first instance.

7

Now, supposing this agency, which is charged with doing

8

something about auto safety, simply promulgates some

regulations saying you're going to use passive seat

10

as a matter of administrative law that if an agency

and then they reverse

MR. FITZPATRICK;

We are looking at the

Well, what record do you mean?
Well, the record of the

11

filed with the parties and there were analyses by the

12

agency and there was an opinion written by the agency.

13

There were comments that were

to whether this recission is justified or whether it is

were relying and do rely on the standards of Overton

Parenthetically, we do, in connection with the

colloquy with Justice Stevens, it's clear that the cases

that speak about failure to act at all are a different

consistently given agencies more elbow-room in failure

The cases have

to act than in rescission, or revocation cases.

2

Consistently the cases, which we've cited in our brief

3

involving revocation, have hell the agency to an

4

arbitrary and capricious standard.

5

Now, let me make a couple more comments if I

6

could in connection with the Solicitor's argument.

7

First, as far as the questions of safety, the key fact

8

is that at no point has the agency ever found that

9

non-detachable belts pose any safety problem at all.

10

fact, all the evidence is just to the contrary.

11

spelled this out in our briefs.

In

We have

12

In 1978 the agency concluded that these

13

non-detachable spool-release belts will not cause

14

serious occupant egress problems.

15

proposed that particular kind of belt, said that those

16

belts would provide for rapid egress without use of

17

buckle release mechanisms.

18

the GK safety director said that spool release is viable

19

from a safety egress point of view.

20

In 1978 GM, that had

And in this very proceeding,

So there has been no question on this record

21

at all of support for a problem of egress with a

22

non-detachable or spool-release belt.

23

In terms of the suggestion that the agency

24

continues to be committed to a Coleman plan or the

25

promotion of passive restraints, that as well is totally

belied by the record.

First, there is the suggestion

2

that there be an educational effort to convince people.

3

Paul Newman will step out of his sports car, look you in

4

the eye, and say, "Buckle up."
Well, that program had met with such disfavor

in the Congress that they have denied additional funds

15

16

The Solicitor General notes that the agency has

have a demonstration program in

19

MR. FITZPATRICK:

3

there's any dispute about that, but I don't think it's

I don't think

Now, in conclusion let me address one final

5

6

point.

The Government has in its reply brief attempted

7

to cast this difference as a rather squalid disagreement

8

between the automobile industry and the insurance

9

industry.

The Solicitor saidi

"From the broader

10

perspectives of the nation as a whole, the decision is

11

sound and responsible.'*

12

That approach we think is dead wrong.

But if

13

it were proper to look at this case from the broader

14

perspectives of the nation as a whole, then I ask the

15

Court to lay aside our brief and lay aside Mr. Cutler's

16

brief, and look to the brief of the Epilepsy Foundation

17

of America and the National Society to Prevent Blindness

18

or the brief of the Mothers Against Drunk Driving or the

19

Brief of the American College of Preventative Medicine

20

or the American Academy of Pediatrics, to see where, in

21

the Solicitor's terms, from the broader perspective of

22

the nation as a whole, the responsible action lies.

23

Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that, for the

24

reasons we have advanced today and in our briefs, the

25

decision of the agency rescinding this important and

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

and was properly set aside.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Solicitor General,

•you have four minutes remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

11

MR. LEEs

I think if there's anything that

12

ought to be clear after Mr. Fitzpatrick’s argument, it

13

is that we are dealing in an area of uncertainty, an

14

area that ought to be left to the particular abilities

15

and expertise of the administrative agency.

16

Indeed, I am now uncertain, not only as to

17

what is the best long-range solution, over which 17

18

years* worth of Transportation Secretaries have

19

struggled; I am also uncertain even as to what Mr.

20

Fitzpatrick's position is.

21

I heard on the one hand that the agency whom I

22

represent had found that automatic belts do work,

23

because of the fact that hundreds of thousands — there

24

have been hundreds of thousands of automobiles that had

25

effective passive belts, and that it had increased usage

44

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

by 40 percent

2

What he neglected to tell you was that the

3

overwhelming majority of those automobiles had their

4

detachable belts guarded by ignition interlocks.

5

surprising thing about those data is that the figure was

6

not much higher than 40 percent, because unless the

7

devices have been tampered with you can't even start

8

your automobile unless those seat belts are buckled.

The

We were then told that what the agency should

9
10

have done was to rule out a belt that doesn't work, then

11

conceding that in fact this was a belt that didn't

12

work.

13

did, and that’s all he did, was to rule out a belt that

14

didn't work.

15

But that in fact is exactly what Secretary lewis

The standard that we urge in this case that

16

should be adopted is whether the Secretary could

17

rationally conclude that there was sufficient

18

uncertainty to justify his not going forward with the

19

procedure that wouldn't work.

20

QUESTION*

Mr. Solicitor General, let me

21

interrupt you about the belt that didn't work.

22

that on the assumption that the belt will be detached

23

just as often as an active belt will not be hooked up in

24

the first instance?

25

MR. LEE;

Isn't

That is correct.

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION*

1

And did the agency even consider

2

the extent to which the belt would be detached as

3

compared with the extent to which people will hook up

4

the belt in the first place?

5

MR. LEE*

6

QUESTION*

7

NR. LEE*

It considered —
I didn’t find it in their report.
It considered it to this extent.

8

Justice Stevens.

It came up to the point that it found

9

that there were no reliable data that indicated one way

10

or the other, so that it was left with the circumstance

11

exactly as Secretary Coleman had, that you have to make

12

your best judgment.

13

QUESTION*

Just as a matter of common sense,

14

isn't it perfectly clear that there will be greater seat

15

belt usage if the belt is automatically attached and you

16

have to do something affirmative to detach it, as

17

opposed to the active belt?

18

obvious?

19

NR. LEE*

20

perfectly obvious.

There are two things that are

increase, you save over 100 lives a year.
MR. LEE;

3

If you get one percent increase, you

4

may or may not save, you may or may not save lives a

5

year, because you also have to take into account the

6

additional cost and the impact on public reaction that

7

results from the public perception of ineffective

8

regulation which leads to a more expensive example of

9

federal requirements.
This matter of the defeat rate, the problem of

10
11

the individual regarding the device that is in his

12

automobile as an enemy and finding some way to defeat
