ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED H. HODDINOTT» JR., ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HODDINOTT:

9

Chief Justice, may it plea-se

10

the Court, this case concerns Xerox copiers that mere

11

always in foreign commerce, never in domestic commerce

12

or part of the common mass of property in the state of

13

Texas, paused only temporarily in Texas* and were stored

14

in a Customs bended warehouse* always under the custody

15

and control of the United States Customs Service.
The issue is whether Texas can assert property^

16
17

taxes without violating the commerce clause and the

18

import export clausa on goods in that warehouse.

The

19

Texas Court of Civil Appeals said that it could.

It was

20

wrong.
The facts are essentially undisputed.

21

Xerox

22

manufactures copiers domestically and assembles them

23

abroad.

24

requires the assembly of goods in member countries.

25

a result, Xerox decided to build copiers in Mexico to

The Latin American Free Trade Association

Initially» it stored those copiers in the

3

Panama Canal Zone» but because of anti-American feeling

4

there» it sought to store them elsewhere.

5

switch to a Customs bonded warehouse in Houston.

6

Physically» these copiers were assembled in Mexico»

7

trucked by a bonded carrier to Houston» stored in a

8

Customs bonded warehouse in Houston* anywheres from a

9

few days to three years» but always less than the time

10

It decided to

As orders were received» the copiers were

11
12

trucked by a bonded carrier to the ship» and then to

13

Latin America.

14

packaged and built» they could not be used domestically.

Because of the way the copiers were

QUESTION;

15

Mr. Hoddinott» you used the term

16

"Customs bonded warehouse in Houston*" and I know the

17

Court of Civil Appeals opinion certainly speaks in those

18

terms» too.

19

give of a Customs bonded warehouse?

Is there any generic description you can

MR. HODDINOTT:

20

It is a warehouse that is

21

maintained by a warehouseman.

He supplies bonds to the

22

Customs Service that goods that are retained in there

23

will not go out into domestic commerce, and they are —

24

the goods are under the custody and control of a Customs

25

employee.

MR. HQODINQTT:

QUESTIOh:

Your Honor.

I don't know that either.

these copiers ever entered domestic markets.
QUESTION:

9
10

The record is silent on that.

Your Honor, it is conceded that not one of

8

Your Honor, I don't know.

Why didn't Xerox store this

MR. HODDINOTT:

5

Am I right?

That is your basic point, I gather,

is it?

11

MR. HODDINOTT:

12

QUESTION:

It is, Your Honor.

Under the import and export clause,

13

that is unlike Michelin Tires, for example, which were

14

— I gather, from the domestic market.

15

MR. HODDINOTT:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. HODDINOTT:

That's correct, Your Honor.

These are not.
These were not.

It is

18

conceded that not one entered domestic markets, not one

19

was sold for domestic use —

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Now, why do you say that makes a

difference?
MR. H00CIN0TT:

Because they are totally in

23

foreign commerce, and all of the interstate commerce

24

cases that have been cited by the Appellees, I submit,

25

are inapplicable, and this Court has said in Japan Line,

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Ycur Honor, that the constitutional analysis mill be

2

more extensive when it is foreign commerce.

3

QUESTION;

Now, were there instructions,

4

printed instructions with these things, as there are so

5

often, that accompanied the machine?

6

MR. HODDINOTT;

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. HODDINOTT:

9

QUESTION;

10

Yes, Your Honor.

And they were in Spanish?
Spanish and Portuguese.

Portuguese for Brazil.

MR. HODDINOTT;

And the copiers also were

11

electrically different than copiers that are

12

manufactured for the United States.

13

QUESTION;

How about the symobls?

Are there

14

any difference in the symbols cn the beard, or are the

15

letters the same?

16

MR. HODCINOTT;

Since Xerox copiers generally

17

use little figure people, I would imagine that they

18

would be the same, but the descriptions and the manuals

19

would all be different.

20

It is conceded, Your Honor, that these copiers

21

were always segregated from domestic goods, and they

22

were always in the complete custody and control of the

23

U.S. Customs Service.

24

always in foreign commerce.

25

We contend they were therefore

Parenthetical1y, Appellees paid approximately

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

$2 million on copiers that were sold domestically.

2

are not at issue in this case.

3

They

In 1976 and — For 1976 and 1977» the

4

Appellees taxed Xerox with respect to these copiers

5

approximately $280*000 on the full value of the goods.

6

Xerox sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive

7

relief in 1977» alleging that the taxes violated the

8

commerce clause and the import export clauses of the

9

Constitution because the goods were in transit.

10

The trial court agreed.

It said» HGiven the

11

peculiar status of the copiers in the factual context of

12

foreign commerce» they are not taxable because they do

13

not have a substantial nexus with Houston and have not

14

left the palpable flow of foreign commerce.

15

they were still in transit and in foreign commerce."

16
17
18
19

20

In short»

That finding is controlling under Texas law
unless it is manifestly erroneous.
QUESTION:

Does the record show how long some

of these machines remained in the warehouse?
MR. HQDOINOTT:

Yes» Your Honor.

The record

21

shows that they were there anywheres from eight days to

22

approximately three years» as was permitted by the

23

Customs statute.

24
25

The Texas Court of Civil Appeals reversed on
appeal» and decided that taxes were constitutional* and

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

entered a judgment against Xerox cn the Appellee's

2

counterclaims» and the Supreme Court of Texas found no

3

reversible error.
Two key facts permeate this case» we submit.

4
5

First, under the commerce clause, only Congress

6

regulates foreign commerce, and this is foreign

7

commerce.

8

factually the goods are in foreign commerce.

9

in Mexico.

We can — There is no serious dispute that

They pass through Texas, and they went on to

10

Latin America on a continuous journey.

11

legally imported.

12

They start

QUESTION:

They were never

Well, how about the ones that were

13

three three years?

14

them as being on a continuous journey if they spent

15

three years in Houston?

16

Is it really accurate to talk about

MR. HODDINOTTI

I submit they are, Your Honor,

17

because the law is that until they pass the barrier of

18

paying the customs duty, it is as, as this Court said,

19

it is as they — as if they never came into the country,

20

they were detained at the border, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

During that time, I presume that

22

the Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police

23

Department would have to come to the aid of the owner of

24

the private warehouse in the event there was a breakin

25

and Xerox's goods were going to be stolen, or in the

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

event there was a fire that would have destroyed Xerox's

2

goods.

3

MR. HGDDINQTT:

There is no doubt about that»

4

Your Honor, but the owner of that warehouse is also

5

taxed, and we submit that Houston's services are

6

supported by the common carrier that was used, by the

7

warehouseman, by the stevedores, all of whom, we submit,

8

are undoubtedly taxed by Houston.
QUESTION:

9

But you say that this is different

10

even though Xerox's stuff, if it had been destined for

11

domestic use, you have paid taxes on it and it would be

12

taxable.
MR. HODCINOTT:

13
14

the question,

Your Honor.

QUESTION:

15

I am sorry, I didn't follow

If the same amount of Xerox

16

computers had been stored in exactly the same warehouse

17

but destined for domestic use,

18

taxes on them.
MR. HODCINOTT:

19

you, of course, have paid

When you say destined, Your

20

Honor, if they had already passed the Customs barrier,

21

and the duties had been paid, then I would agree, but

22

until the Customs duties are paid, I submit they are not

23

taxable .

24
25

QUESTION:

But it makes no difference to your

case even if they were in the Houston warehouse for 20

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

2

years» I take it
MR. HODDINQTT:

No.

But it— the Customs

3

statutes permit storage for three years» and it makes a

4

difference as long as they mere there for the three

5

years permitted by Congress.

6

QUESTION;

Are you suggesting that in terms of

7

the local protection» the local tax problem that Justice

8

Rehnquist referred to» that all of that cost of

9

protection» fire and police and others» are reflected in

10
11

the rent that you're paying and is passed on to Xerox?
MR. HCDOINOTT:

I subimt that is so» Your

12

Honor, and I also submit that as this Court said in

13

Japan Line, where you are talking about foreign

14

commerce, where there is a need for federal uniformity,

15

that Texas's remedy is with Congress, because we are

16

talking about foreign commerce.

17

QUESTION;

From your point of view, I take

18

your argument to be that this is just legally and

19

constitutionally the same as though these machines were

20

in a big cargo airplane and happened to fly over the

21

lower part of Florida.

22

MR. HGDDINOTT;

Precisely, Your Honor.

As far

23

as I am concerned, they might as well be on a ship in

24

the middle of the ocean, and that's what the cases have

25

held, that until —

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION;

1

Well, in the middle of the ocean it

2

wouldn't have much contact uiith the continental United

3

States, but in an airplane they would at least have some

4

semblance of contact by flying over Key West.
MR. HOOCINOTT;

5

6

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Absolutely,
QUESTION;

7

Mr. Hoddinott, in Japan Lines, the

8

Court said that California's tax on cargo containers

9

that were only in the state less than three weeks would

10

pass muster under the commerce clause, and were not in

11

transit.

12

scheme here, these things would be in transit under the

13

commerce clause?

How can you argue that absent the regulatory

MR. HODDINOTT;

14

Because I submit, Your Honor,

15

that pursuant to the Warehousing Act of 1846, Congress

16

has said, we want to encourage foreign commerce, and in

17

order to encourage that foreign commerce, we want to

18

have transshipment of goods through our ports, and to

19

encourage that transshipment, they said, you may keep

20

those goods there for three years.
QUESTION;

21

You are resting your argument on

22

the possible interference with national foreign policy

23

then ?

24
25

MR. HODDINOTT;

That is certainly one of our

arguments, Your Honor.

12
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

The second important point besides the fact

1

2

that this is foreign commerce is the very nature of the

3

Customs bonded warehouse, some of u/hich we have referred

4

to.

5

and regulations concerning Customs.

6

in Board of Trustees versus United States and in

7

McGoidrick that Customs is a subject of complete federal

8

regulation, and it seems to me it's hard to imagine more

9

complete regulation than when the United States

As the Court is aware, there are detailed statutes
The Court has held

10

government has physical custody and control of your

11

goods.
The legislative history establishes that

12
13

Customs bonded warehouses have a unique place in foreign

14

commerce and are part of the total regulation of

15

Customs.

16

Warehousing Act to, as Congress said, unfetter

17

commerce.

18

alleviate the burden of the then current requirement

19

that all duties on shipments be paid at one time, but

20

second, as I referred to, Justice O'Connor, it was to

21

encourage the use of U.S. ports and ships, and that was

22

to be accomplished by permitting storage of cargoes in

23

warehouses for up to three years, and then transshipment

24

of the goods without the imposition of any duty.

25

The warehouses were established by the 1846

It had several purposes.

QUESTION:

One, is was to

Mr. Hoddinott, I see in a footnote

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to your brief on Page 12 you mention that in 1978

2

Congress extended the period from three years to five

3

years.

4

MR. HODDINOTT:

5

CUESTION:

6

Would that cover your case if it

had been in effect when this situation arose?

7

MR. HODDINOTTi

8

QUESTION;

9
10

That's correct, Your Honor.

I believe it would, sir.

So that you could then store goods

in Houston for five years, at least five years under
your theory.

11

MR. HODDINOTT:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Well, I gather, Mr. Hoddinott, you

13

would regard that as simply a regulation by Congress to

14

that extent of foreign commerce.

15

MR. H0D0IN0TT:

Yes, I would, sir.

16

The cases are clear —

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Hoddinott, is there any risk of

18

foreign retaliation against the United States for a tax

19

policy of local government like this if there are

20

American goods stored in some foreign country?

21

MR. HODDINOTT:

I think there is a risk, Your

22

Honor, perhaps not with respect to Xerox, because Xerox

23

is a domestic corporation.

24

corporation, I submit there would be substantial risks

25

of multiple taxation that would be applicable.

Had Xerox been a Japanese

The Warehousing Act and all of its subsequent

1

2

legislation delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury

3

the duty to formulate regulations to carry out

4

Congress's intent.

5

regulations prohibited state taxation of goods in

6

Customs bonded warehouses.

Starting in 1915» the Treasury

Your Honor, last Friday it came to my

7

8

attention that on a week ago Monday, November 1st, the

9

relevant Custom's statutes — regulations ware amended.

10

That appears at 19 CFR — 47 Federal Register, Page

11

49,370.

12

which granted a state tax immunity, was deleted.

In that amendment, the footnote to 19 CFR 19.6,

13

The background information about the amendment

14

published by the Treasury Department is silent as to why

15

the footnote is no longer there.

16

QUESTION:

17

(General laughter.)

18

MR. H00DIN0TT:

We believe —

It shows what a big state Texas is.

We believe that for the

19

reasons set forth in our brief, however, the regulation

20

was still controlling during the relevant time period,

21

and as this Court said in McGoldrick, there is no doubt

22

that the Treasury regulation merely reflects Congress's

23

intent to free the warehouses from state tax.

24
25

In 1940, this Court examined the entire
structure of Customs bonded warehouses in the McGoldrick

Mr. Hoddinott, if we adopted your

I don't believe so, Your

QUESTION:

Why not?

11

MR. HODCINOTT:

As applicable to this case,

12

these goods are in foreign commerce, and irrespective of

13

what the Court said in Michelin, always there is some

14

nexus.

15

and we submit that goods in a bonded warehouse don't

have that connection.

17

There is always some connection with the state,

We submit that Xerox's copiers are in transit

contrary without finding the trial court's findings

The trial court so held,

It seems clear to us that by operation of law,

States* too* because a great many people, or at least

2

some people use a righthand drive car in this country,

3

but because it was adaptable, if they had been in bonded

4

warehouses, would that adaptability have any impact on

5

the legal issues in this case?
MS. CHAPMAN:

6

Yes.

The adaptability has no

7

impact on the legal issues.

Our position is that as

8

long as those goods are stored in Houston for the

9

business convenience of Xerox, and there is no question

10

about that, and the State of Texas has acquired a

11

taxable situs, then we are entitled to tax those

12

copiers.

13

QUESTION:

3ut that would be independent of

14

whether they could be modified for domestic use or not,

15

in your view.

16

MS. CHAPMANS

Yes, and this Court has

17

addressed that issue in the case of Kosydar versus —

18

National Cash Register versus Kosydar, where the goods

19

were only designed for foreign use.

20

QUESTION:

Well, a bonded warehouse isn't

21

available, is it, for an importer who simply wants to

22

store his goods in a bonded warehouse pending domestic

23

distribution?

24

MS. CHAPMAN:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, it is.

So you can bring your goods in and

The regulatory scheme involved here are the

these — the same issues are going to be controlling.
We think the tax is neither prohibitive under the import
export clause nor the commerce clause» and the tax does
not interfere uiith domestic — with flow in commerce.
There is no — Unlike Japan Lines» there are
no treaties involved in this case, no conventions or
trade agreements.

There is no genuine conflict of law

problem as existed in Japan Lines, which resulted in a
multiple taxation of property on an international
level.

We know of no rule of law which would permit

another sovereignty to tax property — to tax Xerox's
copiers, impose a property tax on Xerox's copiers while
under the exclusive protection of the State of Texas.
The tax has no effect on the government's need
to speak with one voice, which is an import export
concern, and speaking with one voice under the import
export clause is assured when the federal government and
the federal government alone imposes Customs duties.
Xerox is well aware of the benefits, ana can
well appreciate the benefits provided by the State of
Texas.

The reason that Xerox removed its distribution

operation from Panama to Houston was that
riot-threatened Panama could no longer protect its
copiers.
