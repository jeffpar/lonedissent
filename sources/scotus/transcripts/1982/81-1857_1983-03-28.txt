ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. FROHNMAYER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FROHNMAYER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
Today, the state of Oregon asks this Court to

10

finetune a salutary rule in order to make it more

11

workable in the real world.

12

Miranda versus Arizona allows reasonable police

13

investigation into serious crime, including allowing the

14

innocent to clear their names from suspicion, or whether

15

the Miranda and Edwards doctrines will be misconstrued

18

to imprison potential suspects in a web of their

17

privileges or prohibit them from changing their minds.

18

The question is whether

This case is here today because the Oregon

19

Court of Appeals overextended Edwards versus Arizona and

20

distorted the very protections this Court established in

21

Miranda versus Arizona.

22

briefly summarized.

23

The facts,

I believe, may be

Bradshaw's contact with law enforcement

24

authorities arose both because he was a suspect in a

25

vehicular homicide and because he claimed to have been

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the victim of a criminal assault

2

Oregon state police, he answered questions about

3

inconsistencies between the story he had volunteered and

4

the accounts of other witnesses.

5

At the request of the

Prior to this questioning, he was advised of

6

his Miranda rights and he was told that he was not under

7

arrest and that he was free to leave.

8

admissions that Bradshaw made during questioning at the

9

Rockaway police station, Corporal Hays then placed him

Based on certain

10

under arrest for furnishing liquor to a minor and

11

advised him again of his Miranda rights.

12

Shortly thereafter, when Corporal Hays

13

suggested to the accused a theory that Bradshaw had been

14

the driver of the car and was responsible for the

15

homicide, Bradshaw stated he wanted an attorney "before

16

it goes very much further."

17

terminated and Bradshaw was transported to Tillamook

18

county jail for booking.

The interview was promptly

At some point during this process, Eradshaw

19

20

asked the question, "Well, what is going to happen to me

21

now?"

22

then immediately reminded the accused of his right to

23

counsel and that he did not have to talk.

24

stated, "I understand."

25

The testimony is unchallenged that Corporal Hays

QUESTIQH:

Bradshaw

May I interrupt with one question?

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Does the record tell us when he first got the assistance

2

of counsel?

3

MR. FROHNMAYER*

As far as the record is

4

clear. Your Honor, he first received actual counsel

5

sometime after his arraignment the following day.

6

is no point in this exchange I've described at which

7

counsel was available.

8
9

10

QUESTION*

There

Is there any evidence that the

state made any effort to get him counsel before that
time?

11

MR. FROHNMAYER:

There is evidence that the

12

state -- there is not only evidence, there is testimony

13

by Corporal Hays that he suggested that he call an

14

attorney and Corporal Hays further testified that he

15

believed that there was time for him during his stay at

16

the station house to have called an attorney.

17

record also shows that the police contacted, at the

18

request of the accused, Bradshaw, a person by the name

19

of Irma Stockdale, but beyond that, the record is silent

20

with respect to —
QUESTION*

21
22

Well, was he represented by

retained counsel in the proceeding that followed?

23

MR. FROHNMAYER*

24

QUESTION!

25

And the

I do not believe so, no.

He was represented by appointed

counsel?

5

1

MR. FROHNMAYER«

2

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.

And so — but no effort was made to

3

obtain appointed counsel until after his arraignment, is

4

that right?

5

MR. FPOHNMAYERs

That’s correct, bearing in

6

mind, of course, that the events I'm describing occurred

7

on a Sunday evening, during the weekend period of time

8

in a small town on the Oregon coast.

9

The interview -- testimony is unchallenged

10

that, of course, the accused was immediately reminded

11

that he did not have to talk and that he had the right

12

to an attorney.

13

the wide-ranging conversation that then ensued in the

14

drive to the Tillamook county jail, no incriminating

15

statements were elicited, but Bradshaw did agree to take

16

a polygraph test the next morning to test the veracity

17

of his story.

18

Bradshaw stated that he understood.

In

The next morning, which was a Monday morning,

19

another Oregon state police officer explained to

20

Bradshaw the polygraph test procedures and readvised him

21

again of his Miranda rights.

22

although he waived the right to counsel he could stop

23

the test and speak to an attorney at any time.

24
25

He told Bradshaw that

Bradshaw then signed a written acknowledgement
and waiver of his rights.

The waiver included both a

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

consent to take the polygraph test and a consent to talk

2

to the Oregon state police.

3

course of a conversation initiated by defendant's

4

questions relating to polygraph procedures, Bradshaw

5

ultimately made the incriminating admissions which are

6

in issue today.

After the test and in the

7

The trial court found after hearing testimony

8

concerning these events that there had been no threats,

9

promises or enducements leading to these admissions, and

10

that although Bradshaw had once expressed a desire for

11

counsel, he had simply changed his mind.

12

We come to the Court today with three

13

contentions, which I would like to argue in reverse

14

order to the —

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

QUESTION;
changed his mind?

On what basis is it alleged that he
Did he say, I change my mind?

MR. FROHNMAYER;

No, he didn't say that

precisely. Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Well, where did we get the

conclusion that he did change his mind?
MR. FROHNMAYER;

Well, the trial court, of

22

course, heard the testimony of the corporal, and the

23

defendant was present in the courtroom, and then various

24

of the other police officers.

25

the court was entitled to consider were these;

And among the facts that
the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

defendant, by the time he made these statements, had

2

been twice advised of his Miranda rights and after he

3

asked the question, "What is going to happen to me?" he

4

was reminded again immediately by Corporal Hays that he

5

had the right to counsel and that he did not need to

6

talk to the police officer, and that the testimony is

7

uncontroverted that he then said, "I understand."

8

Further evidence —

9

QUESTION:

Is the testimony also undisputed

10

that before that, he asked for a lawyer and that he

11

didn’t get one?

12

MR. FROHNMAYER:

x
It is undisputed that he

13

said, "I would like an attorney before it goes very much

14

f urther."

QUESTION:

19

And that he didn’t get one.

Does the record show that he didn’t

get one?
MR. FROHNMAYER;

Yes, the record shows that he

did not get one.
QUESTION:

And then he was continually

questioned?
MR. FROHNMAYER;
promptly ceased.

No, sir.

The questioning was

Corporal Hays terminated the interview

1

as soon as he said "I want an attorney before this goes

2

very much further.”

3

reinitiated conversation by saying "What is going to

4

happen to me?" that there is any further dialogue

5

between the police officer and the accused, so far as

6

the record reflects.

It was only when the accused

NE. FROHNMAYER;

9

QUESTION*

What is the initiation you are

talking about?

12

HR. FROHNMAYER s

13

QUESTION;

14
15
16

No, that’s where the

initiation comes in and that's where the waiver faults.

10
11

Is that where the waiver comes in?

What, I'm sorry --

What is — the initiation comes in,

you say?
MR. FROHNMAYER;

The initiation, and that is

our first —

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. FROHNMAYER;

between the accused and the police.

QUESTION;

What is that?

The initiation of dialogue

Oh, I see.

asked for a drink of water.
MR. FROHNMAYER;

What is initiation?

Well, suppose he had

That would have done it?
That might well have been the

23

initiation of dialogue within the meaning of this

24

Court’s decision in Edwards versus Arizona, and that is

25

precisely what we are here to determine today and that

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1
2

is our first contention
Our contention is, in fact, that the Edwards

3

case should squarely have controlled the disposition by

4

this case of the Oregon Court of Appeals but that the

5

Oregon Court of Appeals misconstrued this Court's

6

decision in Edwards versus Arizona, misapplied it and

7

completely ignored the carefully tailored Footnote 9 of

8

that decision.

9

In that decision, the Edwards decision, this

10

Court stated, as an exception to its rule, that further

11

communications, exchanges or conversations by the police

12

would be an exception if they were initiated by the

13

accused and of course, this is precisely what happened

14

in the case that we have before us today.

15

QUESTION:

Couldn't he -- as I understand the

16

question, what are you going to take — what are you

17

going to do with me?

18

statement that said

I don't see anything in his
I want to be questioned.

19

MR. FROHNMAYER:

20

QUESTION;

I think that —

I don't — is there anything in

21

there to suggest that to you, that I want to be

22

questioned?

23

MR. FROHNMAYER:

24

QUESTION:

25

point it out to me.

Let me answer your question --

Yes or no.

If you say yes, then

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

HR. FROHNHAYER;

There are two separate

2

questions — there are two separate responses to your

3

question, if I may, and they are terribly important so I

4

would like to give them in order.

5

separated.

Two issues have to be

6

First of all, whether under the Edwards test

7

including Footnote 9, defendant initiated, reinitiated

8

dialogue or conversations with the police and then,

9

secondly, whether thereafter the defendant under the

10

totality of the circumstances knowingly, voluntarily and

11

intelligently waived his right to counsel.

12

So our point is, as we understand the meaning

13

of the Edwards decision, is not that the first utterance

14

of the defendant has to be a total Johnson versus Zerbst

15

waiver in itself, which only a law -- honors graduate of

18

a law school could think of to utter, but simply whether

17

it constitutes a break in the silence upon which the

18

defendant has first insisted upon.

19

here.

20

That’s what happened

This is a classic textbook example, in our

21

judgment, of what constitutes the initiation of dialogue

22

or conversations or further exchanges with the police,

23

within the square meaning of the language used in

24

Edwards, within the meaning of the words that this Court

25

established in its Wyrick versus Fields per curiam

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

decision today — this term, and actually. Justice

2

Marshall, a point which you made in your own dissenting

3

opinion in Wyrick versus Fields, in the per curiam

4

decision.

5

And if I may, I think that the words that you

6

wrote demonstrate the point I am trying to make, when

7

you wrote, "When a suspect commences a conversation with

8

a policeman, he has reason to expect that, as in any

9

conversation, there will be a give and take extending

10

beyond the subject matter of his original remarks.

11

may therefore be appropriate to conclude that the

12

suspect's waiver of his Fifth Amendment rights extends

13

to the entire conversation."

14
15

It

Now, that’s our contention of the kind of case
that we have today --

16

QUESTION*

I know that's out of context.

17

MR. FROHNMAYER:

18

QUESTION*

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. FROHNMAYER*

I’m sorry, sir.

I know that is out of context.

Well, but it is within the

21

context, if I may offer, of both Footnote 9 of the

22

Edwards decision and of the language of that decision.

23

And again, let me reemphasize that what we

24

have are two separate inquiries.

Whether or not the

25

absolute, apparently absolute requirement of silence

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

imposed by Edwards once the defendant has asked for his

2

right to counsel and secondly, what follows upon the

3

initiation by the accused of further conversations with

4

the police.

5

It is our understanding that --

QUESTION;

That rule about not asking any

6

questions after asking for a lawyer did not originate

7

with Edwards.

8

handbook of FBI agents, which was quoted in the Miranda

9

case.

It goes back to around 1935, in the

10

MR. FROHNMAYER:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

I understand the origins of —

Right.

It was way back.

It's not

new.
MR. FROHNMAYER:

Nell, I'm not contesting our

14

compliance with the Miranda doctrine, and in fact that's

15

precisely what's in —

16

QUESTION:

But the Miranda doctrine, I

17

thought, said that when he asked, when he says I want a

18

lawyer, you quit questioning.

19

MR. FROHNMAYER:

That's right, and the Edwards

20

decision, which construes the Miranda decision, says

21

there must be no further questioning by the police after

22

a right to counsel is asserted, and that was

23

scrupulously honored by the police in this case.

24
25

Not only was it honored because the
conversation was terminated immediately but when the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

defendant uttered his question, which reinitiated the

2

conversation, the very first thing that the police

3

officer did was not to pounce on the opportunity but

4

rather to remind the defendant that he had previously

5

asserted a right to counsel and previously asserted his

6

right to silence, followed by the defendant's statement,

7

"I understand."

8

Sow that, it seems to me, is exemplary police

9

procedure and yet, it's ironic that the Oregon Court of

10

Appeals, purporting to apply the decision of this Court

11

in Edwards versus Arizona said that that was somehow

12

improper police activity.

13

is at issue today.

And that is what it is that

14

And so to repeat our first contention, it is

15

our judgment, our belief that what occurred here falls

16

squarely within the meaning of this Court, both in the

17

text of and in Footnote 9 to the decision of this Court

18

in Edwards versus Arizona.

19

And consider the differences between this case

20

and what was presented to you in the Edwards decision

21

when you concluded, as a Court, that — unanimously —

22

that it was inappropriate for the police to resume

23

questioning of the defendant.

24

case the police did not initiate the exchange.

25

QUESTION*

Unlike Edwards, in this

Well, what if -- suppose he said, I

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

want a lawyer and the police terminated, said all right,

2

the discussion is over, and the defendant then says

3

well, when am I going to get my lawyer?

4

reopening the dialogue?

5

MR. FROHNMAYER*

Now, is that

Your Honor, I -- it’s not

6

clear to me what the Court precisely meant by reopening

7

the dialogue, except that I —

8
9

QUESTION *

I know, but I’m interested in what

you think reopening the dialogue is.

That would be any

10

kind of, any way in which he — any subject that he

11

reopens with the police like --

12

MR. FROHNMAYER ;

13

QUESTION*

Yes.

Please tell my mother, or could I

14

have a drink of water or give me some writing paper,

15

that’s reopening a conversation?

18

MR. FROHNMAYERi

Yes.

I think that's the best

17

meaning that can be put on that language because I think

18

any other meaning you put on it, any higher threshold of

19

attempting to ask the court to parse the defendant’s

20

statements in order to decide whether it’s one of

21

substance or of procedure, one of policy, one of trying

22

to find out where the facilities are and so forth, would

23

get this Court into a hopeless quagmire of —

24
25

QUESTION*

Oh, really.

Do you mean that?

not confine it to something having to do with the

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Why

1

investigation, as the opening?

2
3

MB. FROHNMAYER*

QUESTION*

Certainly, may I have a glass of

water just can't be what the Court meant in Edwards.

6
7

You see, I don't

think —

4
5

Well.

MR. FROHNMAYER *

Well, I don't know whether

the Court did or not but let me suggest this —

8

QUESTION*

Well, suppose he says, now I lay me

9

down to sleep, would that do it?

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. FROHNHAYER*

12

dialogue.

13

That is not an exchange.

That is not the initiation of

That is not the resumption of conversation.

14

QUESTION*

15

MR. FROHNMAYER*

Oh, then there is some point.
Well, sure.

The Court has

16

said iniatiates dialogue, which presumes some

17

intelligent exchange between human beings and not simply

18

a declaratory statement.

19

QUESTION*

Then a question about when am I

20

going to get the lawyer that I just asked you for, that

21

reopens the dialogue?

22

a response?

23

Because it calls for some kind of

MR. FROHNMAYER*

I think it certainly calls

24

for a response and I think that it would reopen the

25

dialogue, but let me be very clear about what we are

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

asserting.

2

reopens the dialogue, that anything that's immediately

3

said thereafter is fair game.

4

We're not asserting that simply because that

We're simply saying that, having reopened the

5

dialogue, you then have crossed the threshold which this

6

Court set as the basis beyond which you couldn't tread

7

once a person asserted the right —

8

9

QUESTION;

And then it's just a question of

voluntariness and the totality of the circumstances?

10

BE. FROHNMAYER;

Yes, but we don't believe

11

that that is necessarily an easy test to be met. Justice

12

White.

13
14

QUESTION;

Oh, I understand.

I understand

that.
BR. FROHNBAYER:

15

We're simply saying that we

16

believe this Court was establishing a threshold that

17

said we don't want the police simply to go back and

18

reask and reask and reask a person, well, do you really

19

waive your right to counsel, did you really mean it.
So apparently the thrust of the Edwards test,

20
21

as we understand it, was to require some kind of

22

initiation of conversation that would not only show that

23

the defendant was not standing firmly on his right to

24

silence but that he wanted further information of some

25

kind.

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION;

Well, what if the defendant says

2

I'd like a glass of water and the police officer says,

3

fine, I'll go get you one, did you really mean to waive

4

your rights or did you really want an attorney?
MR. FROHNHAYER;

5

Fine.

I think that under the

6

Johnson versus Zerbst standard of waiver that that would

7

not be found to be a voluntary, knowing and intelligent

8

waiver of his right to counsel.
QUESTION;

9

Of course, you don't know what he’s

10

said yet.

11

said two things, that I'll get you a glass of water and

12

are you sure you want a lawyer.

13

responds at that point, on second thought I don't want a

14

lawyer, then you say Johnson against Zerbst is not met?

15
16

All you know is that the police officer has

HR. FROHNMAYERi

But in any event, it clearly was not a trivial

question that was asked in this case, and the police

officer, out of an abundance of caution, wanted to make

15

it clear to the accused, and the record shows he did so

because he wanted to be fair to the accused, that before

individual was interviewed following the polygraph

Justice —
QUESTION:

Were they suggestive, were they

prompted — were they prompting statements, to prompt an

accused, an arrested person to open up?

7

MR. FROHNMAYER:

Well, we have two different

8

occasions on which that might have occurred.

9

is unclear with respect to the first because we have

The record

10

only the recollection of the officer, which is, although

11

it is uncontroverted by the accused, as to what occurred

in the Rockaway county jail and enroute to the Tillamook

county jail.

14

repeated his story that he had been the victim of an

15

assault and the thrust of the police officer's response

16

to that was a polygraph would help to clear this up.

17

And the defendant's apparently repeated statements that

18

I want to clear this thing up.

19

And there the defendant apparently

Now, that certainly is a far cry from some

20

forms of interrogation which this Court has found to be

21

impermissible and I suppose it's a debatable question

22

whether under the Rhode Island versus Innis standard, it

23

amounts to interrogation at all.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, didn't the Court indicate in

Rhode Island against Innis that the statements made by

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

the police were indeed suggestive and of a prompting

2

nature?

3

And yet we approved it.
HR. FROHNHAYER:

Yes, well, I believe that

that's correct.

5

that can be said of it is that the defendant was told

that he could clear up his story by taking a polygraph

test.

offered by the defendant himself.

QUESTIONS

If the language in Edwards about

He says what

happens to me now, you say you sit down and wait for

Wouldn't that be a good response?

HR. FROHNMAYER;

18

I think it would have been a

19

nonresponsive response.

I think that the response that

20

he gave was the most responsible one that a police

21

officer of this nation would be asked to give and that

22

is, before I say anything to you, I want you to

understand you've already asked for counsel and that

you've already said — that I've told you you could be

fact reminded him in a much more extended way, which is

7

actually sat forth in detail in the transcript and is

8

available for the Court's perusal.

9

But here is our problem.

If the initiation

10

standard of Edwards means something more than the

11

initiation of dialogue, however trivial or however

12

serious, then the police officer’s only response may

13

well be one of silence because of the officer's

uncertainty with respect to whether or not the question

15

is one of overall significance to the case or merely a

trivial one.

Amendment.

Our final contention is that if the initiation

requirement of Edwards must be construed to compel the

result in the Oregon Court of Appeals, then we

9

respectfully suggest that the modified per se test of

10

Edwards should be reformulated because we believe that

11

that modified per se test establishes a distinction

12

between the Fifth Amendment right to silence and right,

13

to counsel, which is not in that amendment itself and

14

was suggested by Miranda.

15

And we suggest that it is a per se rule which

16

ironically enough could encourage the police rather than

17

discourage them from answering legitimate questions that

18

help inform the defendant about his own status.

19

course, it may completely exclude a voluntary change of

20

mind of the defendant because a particular initiation

threshold doesn't happen to be present in a given case.

perplexity we advance in our brief, why, though both

2

rigorous than a waiver of the derivative Fifth Amendment

3

right to counsel.

4

Our response to the Court would simply be that

the request for counsel does not invariably mean the

defendant is less able to protect his own rights under

all circumstances.

20

There are four criteria or things that can be

21

raised that will show that Bradshaw did not initiate the

dialogue with the police officers in this case.

23

would like just to briefly mention these four criteria

24

as a useful test and then get into them a little more

25

elaborately as it relates to the facts of Bradshaw.

And I

27

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

First of all as it relates to initiation or

2

reopening the dialogue, to initiate, the accused must

3

say something that is relevant to the criminal

4

investigation to reopen the dialogue.

5

probably most important in this case, there must be some

6

passage of time between the request for the lawyer and

7

any language that’s claimed by the prosecution to be

8

initiatory.

9

Second, and

How, another factor and the third factor to be

10

considered is that if there is any physical separation

11

between the accused and the police officers in space

12

which goes along with the time aspect.

13

more important I think probably is the initiation words

This standard — and third, the idea of

involves the more complex aspect of the intelligent,

understanding; knowing waiver aspect that this Court

discussed about the Arizona Supreme Court’s

interpretation using a consent Fourth Amendment claim.

It has to involve the passage of time and some

meditation, some thought process, to give up the seating

of interrogation, which Bradshaw asked for when he asked

for a lawyer.

applied — I mean they applied this rule, the assumption

2

was, I thought, that although they didn’t give a reason

3

for it, was that when he made this remark it was not

initiation.

I'm using the time factor here as a very

important fact in the sense of the understanding,

intelligently — it can’t really intelligently be put

12

and that's what I just read, is that in the police

what’s going to happen to me now.

A clear case, in answer to Justice O'Connor's

question, the true, the true example of initiation can

be found again in Officer Hays' testimony.

said, hey, what's going to happen to me now.

Officer Hays answers the question, puts him right into

But again, that's the real case of

And that's in the

The one real single factor, and I think in

18

this case, that really stands out as the most important

19

criteria, if I can get to that, is the fact that from

20

the time of the request for the lawyer and from the time

21

that he makes this remark, again we’re talking about

22

just seconds, even in Mosley talking about the

23

self-incrimination aspect, there was at least over two

24

hours, a different police officer and a different crime,

25

when this standard of an intelligent waiver could be

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

applied to this case.

2

It is difficult for me to understand/ if we're

3

going to use this initiation concept as a rule that can

4

cut off and cease questioning/ like happened with

5

Mosley, and apply this qualified rule and not as strict

6

rule where we have to wait to have a lawyer come in and

7

talk to him, where we have to have that buffer, and

8

certainly under these, Johnson versus Zerbst and all

9

these cases, we can't have Bradshaw making an

10

intelligent decision to initiate this thing and to

11

reopen the dialogue in 60 seconds.

12

If we take the attorney — and this is also, I

13

might add, if you take this event of initiation and move

14

it closer in time to the request for the lawyer and

15

eventually where they almost stand on top of each other,

16

we've almost got this conjunctive of Bradshaw saying, I

17

want a lawyer, and what's going to happen to me, now.
As you move these two events closer and

18
19

closer, I think to have any real meaning to initiation,

20

you have to come closer and closer to an express form of

21

recision of that request.

this particular record is that the state has the burden

of proof.

4

do know on the face of the record that Bradshaw asked

5

for a lawyer.

6

initiation, as I understand Edwards, must be shown by

7

the accused — I mean, sorry, by the state that Bradshaw

had initiated this conversation.

And it is a heavy burden, as it relates — we

And

reaccusation and then the working out of the agreement

14

to take the polygraph examination.

15

view this in a context, if the event of what’s going to

16

happen to me now occurred after Officer Hays’ second

17

accusation, accusing him of killing — of killing

18

Reynolds, then still on the, face of this record, what do

we have by way of initiation?

There's nothing on this record.

I emphasize the time aspect because, again,

8

it's difficult to understand — I don’t want to be

dogmatic about that.

It may be read differently by the

10

Court of Appeals.

11

existing state of the record, you're looking at a

12

situation, if you accept the state's argument, you're

17

that's got to be equivalent to saying no, Officer Hays,

of the imagination,

to conclude that he says I want a

lawyer and then, I don't want a lawyer.

If you look at this, though, at the

Two other aspects of the case that may bear

upon how you interpret this particular statement is,

23

there was no physical separation for sure between

Officer Hays and the defendant for a very short period

25

of time.

I think we are looking at, at the outside, the

5

QUESTION:

So

Is there anything in the record as

to how long it takes to go from Rockaway to Tillamook?
MR. BABCOCK:

No, Your Honor.

There is no way

6

to know exactly what happened enroute, though Bradshaw

7

finally did agree to take the polygraph examination.

8
9

With the idea, again, of initiation, the
fourth thing I would mention is that there would be some

10

words, some way to imply a waiver of this request in

11

looking at the words of initiation, and most certainly,

12

what’s going to happen to me now doesn't really imply

13

any kind of a waiver, I think, any way you want to read

14

it, at least in the Johnson versus Zerbst environment.

15

And for this reason, I think that as far as

16

all four of these criteria that I'm talking about, the

17

concept of initiation in creating that buffer and that

18

protection for the accused is pretty much going to mean

19

not very much any time you say anything that's going to

20

allow the police officers to reaccuse you and keep the

NR. FROHNMAYER*

Thank you very much, Mr.

Chief Justice.

4

Three quick remarks on the factual statements,

two responses to the public defender, and then I will

6

conclude.

7

First, in reference to the Joint Appendix, on

8

pages 17 and

9

Corporal Hays put the defendant in the squad car and

18, there is no basis for concluding that

10

then immediately accused him of killing the victim.

11

only evidence is that, on the way from Tillamook — from

12

Rockaway to Tillamook, there was a wide ranging

13

conversation covering this and many related matters.

What is your version of the record,

15

or do you think it's important, as to when Bradshaw

16

asked him what's going to happen to me now.

MR. FROHNMAYER;

Our view is frankly that the

18

timing of the statement is not relevant to the question

18

of initiation.

22

QUESTION*

Well, what if it were?

What's your

view of when it took place?
MR. FROHNMAYER*

Our view of what is to happen

23

to me now, is that it took place either at the station

24

or shortly after he went into the police car.

25

It's not relevant to the question of

Probably the better reading is that it

probably happened in the police station but the Court of
Appeals of Oregon, as Justice Rehnquist has noted,

QUESTION:
