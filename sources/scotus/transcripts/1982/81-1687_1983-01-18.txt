CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

2

Before we hear the

3

arguments in Sony Corporation against Universal City

4

Studios, in case counsel were not in the courtroom at

5

10<00 o’clock this morning,

6

that Hr. Justice Brennan is unavoidably absent,

7

attending the funeral of a member of his family, and he

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEAN C. DUNLAVEY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

15

17
18

Mr. Dunlavey, you may

MR. DUNLAVEY*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court*
The first issue presented by this case is

19

whether a person who receives a free off-the-air

20

television broadcast in his home by use of a video tape

21

recorder, as distinguished from a television set, is

22

thereby committing direct copyright infringement on the

23

program that he is receiving.

24
25

Now, in this case no remedy is sought against
any so-called direct infringer, but the Ninth Circuit

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has answered the question yes, and if the Ninth Circuit

2

is upheld then there are some five million-plus video

3

tape recorder owners who will be at the mercy of any

4

copyright owner who seeks to take advantage of the

5

situation.

6

The second issue before the Court is whether

7

there has been contributory copyright infringement by

8

the Petitioners in this case, and bear in mind that they

9

are the manufacturer, the American distributor, and the

10

American national advertiser of a video tape recorder

11

whose brand name is Betamax.

12

Again, the Ninth Circuit has answered that

13

question yes, and Universal has moved immediately to

14

exploit the situation by filing a second action in the

15

Ninth Circuit against some 50 additional VTR suppliers,

16

and also has filed a second suit against the same

17

Petitioners in this action alleging that, on information

18

and belief, one or more video tape -- one or more

19

Betamax owners has copied every single production that

20

Universal has put on television since genesis and must

21

account for that in statutory damages.

22

Sow, the pernicious point in the contributory

23

infringement aspect is that Universal is seeking either

24

an injunction — and they are dead serious about it —

25

an injunction against the video tape recorder and/or

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

statutory damages.

2

it’s $250 for every owner for every program, and that's

3

the financial liability that they seek to assess upon

4

the Petitioners.

5

And when we talk statutory damages,

So it only takes common sense to realize that

6

the ultimate issue before the Court in this case is

7

whether under the current law all Americans are going to

8

be denied the benefit of time shift home television

9

viewing because a few program owners object.

10

If there is to be time shift viewing, and by

11

that I mean a viewing of a program at some time not too

12

long after the broadcast, then manifestly there has to

13

be a record of that program to exist between the time of

14

the broadcast and the time of the viewing.

15

that something is a video tape.

16

Congress at least, is a copy, and thereby comes the rub,

17

because the copyright law says that only the copyright

18

owner has the right to make a copy of his copyrighted

19

work, unless of course he gives consent.

20

In this case

It, by definition of

So the direct infringement question here is

21

whether that copy that exists in the form of the

22

videotape between the broadcast and the playback is an

23

infringing copy or is it an example of fair use.

24

is no problem with the playback.

25

authorized specifically by statute.

There

with the copy.

2

The case has been presented by the Respondents

3

through four individual owners.

4

owners really are atypical if you want to look at it

5

from the standpoint of the American public.

6

had 100 tapes, one of them had 170 tapes, one of them

7

had 340 tapes — all this at a time when the norm was 30

8

tapes.

10

commonality that gives the issue to the Court this

11

morning.

13

15

Whatever else they did, they copied 32

17

of his house.

18

perhaps his friends in a couple of instances, and the

19

usage was singularly of the kind we call time shift.

20

the opinion states, it*s the recording, the holding for

21

a short period of time, then watching and then erasing,

22

and the erasing is automatic as you record something

23

else.

24
25

It never got out

It was only intended for his use and

As

Because of the trial judge’s wishes, there are
surveys in the case.

They have to do with the use of

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Betamax generally by the persons who were surveyed.

2

But it must be borne in mind that none of those surveys

3

has anything to do with the particular works which have

4

been infringed allegedly.

5

pertains to Respondents* work at all, neither those in

6

issue nor of any other kind.

7

None of those surveys

And again specifically, none of those surveys

8

shows any librarying of Respondents' work.

Now,

9

librarying is the other kind of home use that creeps

10

into the case.

11

prolonged period of time — and that's never been

12

defined — and looks at it for a number of times — and

13

the number has never been defined — then at least

14

theoretically there becomes a time when he becomes

15

saturated with that program.

16

If a person keeps his tape for a

But if that happens, it's outside of this

17

case, because it is not a factor as to any of the 32

18

works that are in issue.

19

comments, a summarization of his comments with respect

20

to librarying, was simply that it has not been proven

21

that many persons will library to any significant

22

extent.

23

The trial judge's only

The trial judge also ruled out certain

24

additional uses that can be made of these tapes if the

25

owner is so inclined.

You can duplicate them,

Or you can

All of those things are theoretically

6

7

possible, but there is no evidence in this case that any

8

of that was done with respect to any of the Respondents'

9

works.

So the trial judge specifically said, there are

«

10

problems inherent in modern technology that are not in

11

this case and that this case does not purport to

12

resolve.

13

QUESTION*

Mr. Dunlavey, you keep using the

14

word ’’theoretically."

15

as opposed to just theoretically possible.

16
17
18

I suppose it's really possible,

MR. DUNLAVEY:

It is possible, but it's not in

the evidence.
QUESTION*

Would it not make any difference,

19

Mr. Dunlavey, whether it was used once or 25 times under

20

the Ninth Circuit's holding, the second run?

21

MR. DUNLAVEY:

No.

As far as the Ninth

22

Circuit is concerned, the number of times it's run is

23

immaterial.

24

copy is made.

25

The infringement occurs instantly that the

If the use was time shifting today,

could it not be librarying tomorrow?

MR. DUNLAYEY:

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. DUNLAVEYs

Could it?

Yes.
Yes, it could.

And how would one know, really?
One can only find out what's

10

going on with surveys.

11

outside the evidence, and I don't want to do that

12

because my emphasis is to stay within the evidence.

13

you get outside the evidence, librarying is on the

14

decrease because these prerecorded copies are being made

15

available, which are better and they serve the purpose.

16

The surveys — if you get

If

Librarying also is something that the owner

17

first thinks of when he buys his machine.

Here he’s got

18

a device for built-in home entertainment.

But as a

19

matter of fact it turns out to be very expensive, and

20

even one or two of our owners in issue bought with the

21

intent of librarying and then said specifically that

22

they didn’t.

23
24
25

So could it take place?

Yes, but in fact it's

Now, looking at the Betamax — and realize

is being sold, the district court looked at evidence of

5

a number of kinds of uses of this machine which clearly

6

were not infringement, for the owners of the copyright,

7

who might otherwise have said it was infringement,

8

instead said they consented to it.

9

in addition to the public in general, are in favor of

Many program owners,

10

Betamax because many program owners would rather be seen

11

as a second choice some time later than to be missed

12

entirely.

13

The trial judge said that this was a staple

14

item of commerce, that it is suitable for a variety of

15

non-infringing uses, and in that finding he had all

16

kinds of backup evidence, because we had specific owners

17

of various kinds of programs who said that they did not

18

object or consented to the recording.

19

time on the details, they included sports program

20

copyright owners, religious owners, children's

21

programming owners, entertainment programming owners.

22

And as an aside, the American Broadcasting Company right

23

now is on the verge of broadcasting programs at night,

24

or early in the morning, really, from 2*00 to 6*00,

25

intended for reception with a VTR, so that somebody can

also educational programs.

3

And there were

And although Universal prevailed upon the

4

court to find that there was no legitimate use for the

5

Betamax — on the Ninth Circuit Court -- Universal

itself is a signatory to an agreement called Guidelines,

which is a type of agreement between copyright owners

8

and educators.

House Committee report and sanctioned by the Senate

It has been given the dignity in the

10

Committee, the Conference Committee report that followed

11

it, that what they could agree upon would be deemed a

12

fair use.
QUESTION*

13

Mr. Dunlavey, this was a finding of

14

fact, was it, by the district court, that it was a

15

staple of commerce?

16

MR. DUNLAVEY:

17

QUESTION*

18

And the Court of Appeals upset that

finding of fact?
MR. DUNLAVEY*

19

20

Yes, it was.

The Court of Appeals rolled

over it like it wasn't even there.

The Court of Appeals

21

QUESTION:

22

So you must be saying that the

23

Court of Appeals what, misapplied the clearly erroneous

24

test?

25

MR. DUNLAVEY:

The Court of Appeals really

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

didn’t apply the clearly erroneous test at all.

2

ignored the findings.

3

and say that this finding is wrong.

4

substituted its own impressions in every respect.
QUESTION*

5

It

It didn't take a single finding
It simply

I certainly got the impression from

6

reading Judge Kilkenny's opinion that the opinion said

7

in effect this finding was wrong.

8

say in so many words it was "clearly erroneous."
NR. DUNLAVEY;

9

I realize, he didn't

Judge Kilkenny said that the

10

machine was not suitable for substantial non-infringing

11

use.

12

it was that all broadcast programs now can be

13

copyrighted, from the time they're broadcast at least,

14

and since the Betamax is intended to record a television

15

program, ergo it must follow that it was designed only

16

to copy something that was copyrighted.

But to the extent that he gave any reason for it,

17

What the Ninth Circuit missed was that there

18

are a lot of copyright owners, far more than those who

19

object in fact, who consent to copying.

20

have copyrights, but they have agreed that the Betamax

21

may copy it.

Yes, they may

22

Also, there’s another category of copyright

23

owner, at least in the first instance, who might have

24

had copyright protection, but before he can bring an

25

infringement suit he has to register his work and

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

thereby lay the groundwork for having an infringement

2

suit to follow it.

3

And there are a number of stations around the country

4

which don't go to the trouble of registering or

5

copyrighting their programs.

6

one broadcast and then turn around and reuse it for

7

another.

8

worthwhile copyrighting it.

No registration, no infringement.

They use their tape for

They have decided, apparently, that it’s not

It is our contention that those people have

9
10

knowingly forfeited their right to enjoin home

11

recording, and that that kind of programming, even

12

without their specific consent, is also a legitimate

13

use.
QUESTION*

14

Hr. Dunlavey, what are the

15

practical effects of finding that it’s a staple item of

16

commerce?

17

the patent field.

18

to the copyright area?

19

would be the effect of such a finding?

And that’s a doctrine that was developed in
Are there cases that have adapted it

HR. DUNLAVEY:

20

And as a practical matter what

The answer is yes, it has been

21

alluded to in the copyright area, but it was a long time

22

ago.

23

was confronted with a motion picture which had been made

24

without authority of a copyrighted book called "Ben

25

Hur."

It was Justice Holmes in the Kalem case, and he

And nobody even questioned that the makers of the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

camera and the film were infringers, but there was a

2

question as to whether the person who had made the film

3

was a contributory infringer when the person he gave it

4

to exhibited it — exhibited it.

5

And Justice Holmes made a very terse but

6

pointed comment that there are a lot of things in

7

society that when you sell them they might be useable

8

for a wrongful purpose, and you set your mind to

9

inquiring when the man makes and sells that product,

10

does he really have cause to know that it’s going to be

11

used for a wrongful purpose?

12

So the staple item concept came up.

Justice

13

Holmes said that if you have an indifferent supposition,

14

that the buyer might be going to use your product for a

15

wrongful purpose, that certainly does not suffice to

16

make you a contributory infringer.

17

if you're selling something that's a staple item of

18

commerce — and by definition that is something that has

19

got legitimate uses — then you as a manufacturer cannot

20

have the buyer's motive imputed to you.

21

the staple item is important.

22

QUESTIONi

By the same token,

That's where

So in your view that would protect

23

both the manufacturers and the retailers and

24

wholesalers?

25

HR. DUNLAVEYs

And the distributor and the

QUESTION*

3

MR. DUNLAVEY*

Distributors.
There are so many legitimate

4

uses to which this machine can be put that it's grossly

5

unfair to hold the manufacturer if somebody misapplies

6

it, assuming that it is a misapplication.

7
8
9

Now, the other thing of course that the
supplier —
QUESTION*

What would you say, Mr. Dunlavey,

10

if every program that came over television was not only

11

copyrighted, but the copyright owners didn't want their

12

programs copied on a Eetamax?

13

Then what about the contributor?

14

manufacturer ?

15

MR. DUNLAVEY*

Let's just assume that.
What about the Betamax

If it were the case that no

16

substantial number of copyright owners wanted their

17

televised programs copied, then the argument that I have

18

just made wouldn't have much weight to it.

19

QUESTION*

Yes.

And so you think in this

20

record there’s enough evidence to support the notion

21

that a majority of the programs on the air will not

22

cause the Betamax user any trouble?

23

MR. DUNLAVEY*

That's right, that's right.

As

24

a matter of fact, at the time of the trial the only two

25

people in the whole country who had ever brought an

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

action to try and prevent the use of the VTR were the

2

two Respondents today, and that's still the fact.

3

QUESTIONS

What about these cassettes that are

4

rented?

5

rent a cassette and have a movie at home.

6

generally copyrighted, so that this doctrine would apply

7

to them?
MR. DUNLAVEY:

8

9

People don’t want to pay a babysitter, so they
Are those

Those are copyrighted.

This

doctrine really doesn’t reach that point because one of

10

the facets of the YTR in home reception off the air is

11

its aspect to record a program being broadcast.

12

Chief Justice, you have surmised that the man was given

13

a copy with the consent of the copyright owner to begin

14

with, and that tak.es us out of the field of this case.

Mr.

15

Now, the other aspects of contributory —

16

QUESTIONi

There is evidence in this record,

17

isn’t there, particularly about the early advertising on

18

the part of Sony that indicated that, copyright or not,

19

this machine could produce this for use and the like?

20

In other words, there is some evidence against your

21

position.

22

MR. DUNLAVEY:

Not with respect to the

23

particular alleged infringements in issue.

24

advertisements.

25

who made any of the recordings in issue saw or was

They did get into evidence.

There were
But nobody

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

influenced by them.

So whatever those advertisements

2

were, they are not germane to the infringement in

3

issue.
And needless to say, once the litigation

4
5

started Sony's advertisements were toned down markedly

6

so that they didn't induce somebody into the wrong kind

7

of usages.

8
9

Now, the other half of contribution, or
contributory infringement, is did you induce or cause

10

somebody to do the direct infringement, and the district

11

court said, no, there was no evidence in this case that

12

the ads or statements by any of the Petitioners in any

13

way induced or caused the copying that took place.

14

district court also held the obvious, that there is no

15

right, no ability on the part of the Petitioners to

16

control the use of the Betamax once it’s bought and

17

taken home.

18

The

On the other hand, the Ninth Circuit did the

19

same thing that it did throughout.

20

dixit that there is "no doubt" that Petitioners induced

21

or caused this direct infringement.

22

Petitioners are sufficiently engaged in the enterprise

23

to be held accountable.

24
25

It simply said ipse

It also said that

No explanation.

As a side matter on this inducement, Sony has
put in every Betamax carton a printed warning to the

17

2

programs may be contrary to copyright laws.

QUESTION:

Didn't the district court make a

MR. DUNLAVEYs

The district court goes back to

the point that there is so much material where it’s

acceptable to copy that you don't have to anticipate a

particular wrongful use.

Now, which of those four should we count as
non-infringing uses within this argument?
MR. DUNLAVEY;

You should — I would urge you

15

to consider, Justice Stevens, as non-infringing uses the

16

cases where the copyright owner consents; the case where

17

the copyright owner has forfeited his right to an

18

infringement action by putting it beyond his power any

19

longer to register his work; also, the work which is not

20

copyrightable from the outset, and that includes, for

21

example, government-produced matters; and there are also

22

matters where copyright has expired.

QUESTION;

But as to those copyrights where if

24

he were asked the copyright owner would say, no, I don’t

If he says —

MR. DUNLAVEYs

That's a very interesting

point, Justice Stevens, and you're getting now to where

public policy mixes with the copyright owner's rights.

8

I would say that if the copyright owner says, I'd rather

9

you didn't do it but I don't care enough to sue you

having access to the information should take precedence

Hr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court*
Although the technology involved in this case

makes the case more interesting than the normal

6

copyright case, all that the case really involves is

7

unauthorized and uncompensated copying of entire motion

8

pictures, and that's something that's never been

9

permitted by the Copyright Act.

Neither Congress nor

10

any court has ever permitted such copying, merely

11

because it takes place in the home rather than someplace

12

else, or because the copy is taken from the television

We're not talking about

Congress recognized this value

7

How, before I get into the legal issues I’d

8

like to emphasize three overriding facts that pervade

9

this case and I think they must be brought out early.

10

First, it's got to be emphasized that if the Ninth

11

Circuit is affirmed it is not true that absolutely all

12

future sales of video tape recorders will be banned from

13

this country forever.

14

there are several alternate remedies that are available,

15

and I think are even likely when the district court

16

finally gets to the remedy issue on remand.

17

As we’ve stated in our briefs,

One such remedy, for example, would be the

18

continuing royalty suggested by the Ninth Circuit.

19

could be accomplished by withholding a permanent

20

injunction on the condition that Sony and the

21

Petitioners pay a license fee to the Respondents for the

22

continued use of their works.

23

something that Sony's own president advocated six years

24

ago, shortly after this lawsuit —

it is going to be so used, and if so how frequently?

2

How would you measure that?

MR. KROFTs

Your Honor, I think, that would be

a matter of proof put before the district court in the

form of surveys and other evidence.

Would it not be true that all other

It is your suggestion that all copyright

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

owners would be entitled to a royalty from the

2

manufacturer of Betamax because it's sold primarily, as

3

you suggest, for infringing use.

4

MR. KROFTs

I think if we get that royalty and

5

this Court affirms the Ninth Circuit and the royalty is

6

affirmed, as I believe it would be and should be, I

7

think I have to say yes, Your Honor, that's true.
QUESTION;

8
9
10

Mr. Kroft, was the district court

finding that the items were staple items of commerce a
finding of fact?
MR. KROFTs

11

Your Honor, it may have been a

12

finding of fact, but it was an incomplete finding if it

13

was a finding of fact.

14

patent statute, which we strenuously resist here, the

15

patent statute requires that not only must the product

16

be a so-called staple article of commerce, but it must

17

be suitable for substantial non-infringing uses.

18

the cases have put a gloss on that requirement and said

19

that that may not just be a theoretical non-infringing

20

use, but these substantial non-infringing uses must also

21

be actual non-infringing uses, actual uses found of the

22

product.

Because if you analogize to the

And

The district court very pointedly did not find

23
24

that Betamax is suitable for substantial non-infringing

25

use.

And I think if you'll at Petitioner’s appendix at

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

page 97, you will see that the district court said that

2

it was going to be applying its staple article of

3

commerce rationale whether or not there was a

4

substantial amount of non-infringing use of this

5

machine.

6

Petitioners* appendix, he said, whatever the percentage

7

of legal versus nonlegal recording may be, he would

8

still apply his standard.

9

And at page 116, I believe it is, of

So while calling this Betamax a staple article

10

may or may not be a finding of fact, it just doesn't go

11

far enough.

12

3

QUESTION;

Well, if it isn't a finding of fact

then it's a mixed question of law and fact, I suppose?
MR. KROFT;

4

I think whether something is a

5

''staple,” a word that's not defined anywhere in the law

6

that I'm aware of, must be a mixed question of fact and

7

law.

20

QUESTION;

Did the Court of Appeals

characterize it or not?
MR. KROFT;

The Court of Appeals did not

21

characterize it, but the Court of Appeals said that

because everything on television is protected in the

24

everything that's on television is protected in the

sufficient showing that the amount of that material that

2

might be legally copied, if any, was a substantial

3

enough amount to make this a staple article of commerce

4

to the level or sufficient to say that the patent

doctrine, for example, would apply.

HR. KROFTs

Yeah, one way or another.

11

HR. KROFTs

Correct.
And if the Court of Appeals thought

13

that kind of a finding was relevant, I take it, why, I

14

would have thought it might have remanded to the

16

wrong standard or didn't make the findings that it

should have, why did the Court of Appeals make its

to rely on the staple article doctrine, that there was a

4

reason the district court did not make that finding was

because it couldn’t make that finding on the evidence,

QUESTION;

The

If a copying machine. Xerox, IBM or

whatever, advertised that this was a good way to make

10

copies of books for private use, taking the hypothetical

11

that Justice Rehnquist suggested to you, is there any

12

analogy to this situation there?

13

ME. KEOFT*

If your hypothetical existed, Mr.

14

Chief Justice, I would say the analogy would be that the

15

seller of a photocopying machine which is advertised and

16

manufactured for the purpose of having people make

17

copies of copyrighted works in their home or anywhere

18

else would be liable.

19

concerning Xerox.

20

QUESTION:

But those aren’t the facts

Now take the hypothesis that they

21

do not advertise it.

22

the United States who doesn *t know that you can make

23

copies of books on a Xerox or an IBM or any other

MR. KEOFT;

Is there any literate person in

3

the public aware of that. Your Honor, yes.

5

marketed its equipment for the purpose of recording or

6

making copies of copyrighted material.

12

infected this country with the knowledge that causes

copyright infringement, and I think at that point it

14

really doesn’t matter any more exactly what the ads

15

say.

16

And so the mere fact that Sony has now
They have

I might say that under the standard in the

17

trademark area, articulated by this Court in the Inwood

18

case last term, it was suggested by the Court that if a

19

product is sold merely with the implication that it can

20

be used for copyright — for infringing purposes,

21

trademark infringing purposes in that case, that’s

22

sufficient for contributory infringement, at least in

23

the trademark infringement area.

24
25

I think it's also important to emphasize to
the Court that what we’re talking about here is an end

2

different than the end result of commercial piracy.

Now, I'm not suggesting to the Court that an individual

5

pirate.

of Respondents' copyrighted works.

But we're not talking in this case about a
We're talking about

It just makes no difference that the millions

11

of copies end up in their hands because they make them

designed to protect copyright owners from mass copying

from the legislative history that I will take a chance

at quoting now because I think it's important.

said at least three times in the course of the

22

legislative history that isolated instances of minor

pre vented.

affect the market?

MS. KROFTj

And the mere

I believe, Your Honor, that has

10

several effects, both under existing markets and as yet

11

untapped but emerging markets.

12

motion pictures that are shown on television are also

13

available for sale or rental on video cassettes or video

14

discs which are licensed by the copyright owners.

15

They're available for rental, which means generally a

16

person would just want to see it once and then return

17

it.

18

you're referring to, would serve exactly the same

19

purpose.

20

First, many of the

The time shift recording, which I think is what

ABC, referred to by Mr. Dunlavey, is now

21

exploring the use of technology that would permit the

22

copyright owner to license home owners the right to

23

record copyrighted works off the air for a fee, which of

24

course is a right within the exclusive control of the

25

copyright owner.

That's a market that doesn't exist

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

yet, but with Sony's cooperation modifying its circuitry

2

so that you couldn’t record off a scrambled signal, for

3

example, off the air without permission, that’s a market

4

that could be available to copyright owners.

5

So the time shifting type of recording that

6

exists now would destroy that kind of market, because

7

people don’t have to pay for it now; they certainly

8

aren’t going to want to pay for it in the,future.
There's an additional area, Your Honor, that

9
10

we haven't really touched on in our briefs.

11

television series or a motion picture goes off network

12

and goes to the local stations around the country in the

13

syndication market, it’s typically licensed for six

14

runs.

15

syndicated station will not want to take six runs in a

16

license if it knows that people have already been seeing

17

this product many times before it reaches the local

18

station.

19
20
21

When a

I don't think there could be much dispute that a

QUESTIONS

Six runs means six times through

from beginning to end of the series?
HR. KROFT:

Yes,

the entire series would be

22

shown six times, that's what it means.

23

pictures are generally offered for syndication licenses

24

anywhere from three to eight runs per picture.

25

And motion

I think it's also very important to emphasize

here what the economics are of what's going on

2

in commercial piracy, here somebody else is being paid

3

for unauthorized copies of copyright owners' works.

4

Betamax purchasers are paying enormous sums to the

5

Petitioners for the right to make their off-the-air

6

recordings.

misconception.

Yet Petitioners are not sharing any of their

10
11

revenues with the copyright owners whose product, whose

12

television motion pictures, make Betamax such an

13

attractive consumer device.

14

certainly that if these machines couldn't be used to

15

record motion pictures and other type of copyrighted

16

entertainment programming owned by the Respondents and

17

the amici who have filed briefs here, there would be a

18

very substantially reduced demand for that product.
QUESTION;

19

The economic reality is

Well, there'd be a very

20

substantially reduced demand for television sets if

21

there weren't any network television, too.
MR. KROFT;

22

I suppose that's true, Justice

23

Rehnquist.

But you know, Sony had an opportunity here

24

to work with the copyright owners to devise a jamming

25

system that would prevent copying only of the works

2

They abhorred that possibility.

3

They’ve run from it.

Now, to me that proves that they think that

our product is the most important product to people that

5

buy Betamax in terms of what they want to record.

little bit about what’s copyrighted and what’s protected

24

QUESTION:

I think that’s the presumption of

ME. KROFTs

No, Your Honor, that is not

3

correct.

4

5

protected by copyright at the moment of its creation.

6

That's unlike the old scheme that we operated under up

7

until 1976,

8

notice.

9

Under the current Copyright Act, a work which

As soon as there’s creation of the copyrighted

the time when the copyright may be applied for?

15

MR. KEOFT*

Hell, the — Your Honor, I think

when you say "applied for,” you're talking about

22

Registration only affects certain remedies that
It does not affect the

For example, you must register the work before

you can bring suit on it.

But your inability to bring

25

doesn't mean you lose your ability to object, to tell

3

So I think Petitioner’s counsel is laboring

4

under a bit of a misconception when he says that because

5

some local stations with some of their material erase

6

the only copies that they keep of their local television

7

programming and therefore don't register it — that

8

doesn’t mean there's no copyright protection.

9

copyright protection continues.

That

And in answer to your — in further answer to

10
11

your question, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it would be

12

incumbent on Sony, who is selling a machine that's used

13

primarily, by their own admission, to record television

14

programming, and by their own admission the majority of

15

13

whether it is or it isn't, because you have to have the

further finding.

16

MR. KROFT;

It did disagree with the

analysis.

18

was the staple article doctrine doesn't remotely raise

19

copyright problems.

20

very great detail to tell us what it meant by that, but

21

it might have meant that there was no finding of

substantial non-infringing use and therefore it really

23

didn’t matter whether you call it a staple article or

24

not.

25

But actually, Hr. Justice White, what it said

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

issue has to be examined in the context of the overall

2

statutory scheme.

and I'm not going to take the Court through chapter and

4

verse now — Congress gave greater protection to motion

5

pictures than to any other works.

statute itself that home recording of motion pictures

was permitted.

As we've discussed in our briefs —

pictures and the absence of any statement that home

recording is permitted, we submit that any suggestion

accept.

15

QUESTION;

Mr. Kroft, may I ask you a question

here.

different because we're faced with some rather loose

Applying the statutory language in

very forcefully argued that that should be so.

have to contend with that language in 1971, which we

I understand the economics of it.

But do you think within the meaning of the statute it
would be regarded as commercial?
MR. KROFT:

It probably wouldn't.

But in that

statute it also wouldn't be determined to be

noncommercial educational purposes, which is the

counterbalance to the commercial.

established case law on the Petitioners, put it on the

burden.
But if he had looked at what the Petitioners'

owner to license the home owner who's out for dinner the

24

right to copy the Respondent's work off the air, by

25

using the proper technology for a fee.

As I also mentioned a moment ago, there

interfered with here is the opportunity to ever get to

2

that point because now people are doing it for no fee.

3

I’m running out of time.

There are a couple

4

of things I would like to mention very quickly.

5

respect to this argument that there is consent by

6

certain people to record off the air, Mr. Justice White

7

alluded to the fact that a motion picture doesn't just

8

spring out of the air.

9

underlying materiali

It's based on a lot of
the music, which is copyrighted;

10

written work, such as books and plays, which are

11

copyrighted.

12

With

And unless you — and they're all separately

13

copyrighted.

And unless the Petitioner or the copier

14

has the permission of the owners of all of the works

15

that are embodied in that motion picture, there is no

16

valid consent to the recording of that material.

17

But even if there were consent to some

18

material, I think it's very important to emphasize, as

19

the Ninth Circuit did, that just because some copyright

20

owners don't choose to enforce their rights doesn't mean

21

that other copyright owners who choose to enforce theirs

22

cannot do so.

23

supposedly consented to, you find out it's almost

24

nothing compared to what isn't.

25

And when you look at how much is

Petitioners' own survey showed that less than

52

1

nine percent of all recordings consist of sports,

2

religious and educational programming, and that's all

3

sports, religious and educational programming, not just

4

the programming owned by the few witnesses that were

5

brought to the trial by the Petitioners.

6

over 80 percent of all the recordings are of

7

entertainment programming, which was defined in

8

Petitioners* own survey to mean motion pictures,

9

television series and game shows.

copyrighted.

In contrast,

Hell, a lot of sports programs are

At least they announce that they are.

SB. KROFTs

They are copyrighted, Mr. Justice

13

Rehnguist, and you can't copy those programs, based on

14

the evidence that the Petitioners brought to the trial.

15

Because if you watched the Redskins game on Saturday and

16

you heard the little announcement, it said that there

17

could be no use made of that broadcast without the

18

permission of the Washington Redskins and the National

19

Football League.

20

Only the National Football League's Office of

21

the Commissioner gave any testimony on this issue, and

22

the records show that they didn't discuss this issue

23

with any of the individual teams, for example the

24

Washington Redskins.

25

allow even that kind of copying in this record.

So there's not enough consent to

I think, we should leave the staple article of

2

commerce and the contributory infringement issue with

3

this thought:

4

their brief, and I believe it very clearly to be the

5

law, that if there's knowing contribution to the direct

6

infringement involved here, you don't ever have to reach

7

the staple article of commerce argument.

8

approach that was approved by this Court in the Kalem

9

Brothers case.

10

I think that Petitioners conceded in

That was an

It's exactly the approach that is followed in

11

Section 271 of the patent statute, where very

12

specifically the patent statute says that when a

13

defendant causes, furthers, or urges the use of his

14

product, which might otherwise be a staple, in an

15

infringing way then he is liable for patent infringement

16

under Section 271(b) even if you call that product a

17

staple article.

18

QUESTION:

Hr. Kroft, let me ask, suppose it

19

were perfectly clear that 50 percent of the material was

20

not copyrighted or copyrightable that was coming over

21

the air and 50 percent was, and that all the 50 percent

22

of the owners of the copyright would object.

23

suppose that that were the case.

25

MR. KROFT:

Now,

If that were the case, Your Honor,

I would submit that under the test laid down in the

were a few unscrupulous people out there that couldn't
