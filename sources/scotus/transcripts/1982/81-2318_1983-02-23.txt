PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERs

Ms. Snurkowski, you may

proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN M. SNURKOWSKI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. SNURKOWSKIs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
The issue before the Court today is whether
the search of the San Rafael was authorized pursuant to

10

an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement

11

of the United States Constitution.

12

The facts in this case are relatively simple.

13

On September 18, 1977, Officer Soli and Officer Walker,

14

both Marine Patrol officers with the Florida Marine

15

Patrol were traveling along near Sugarloaf Key which is

16

close to Key West.

17

tour of duty had almost ended and they were returning to

18

port when they came upon the San Rafael.

19

of the boat they put their spotlight on the boat, and

20

approaching the boat identified themselves as Marine

21

Patrol officers and asked, at that point, if they could

22

see the registration papers or the registration

23

certificate for the boat which is required pursuant to

24

Florida statutes.

25

They were on their way back.

Their

Within 50 feet

At that point, two individuals who had

departed the cabin area came to the side of the boat and

2

produced papers.

3

statute requirement, but rather, were documentation

4

papers of unspecified nature, and tax receipts

5

reflecting the purchase of the boat.

Those papers did not comport with the

QUESTION*

6

May I ask you something right

7

here.

Now, does Florida law require every boat to have

8

a registration certificate?
MS. SNURKOWSKI;

9

Is that clear?
Those boats that travel in

10

the waters and conduct fishing activities in that area,

11

yes .

12

QUESTIONS

And does the absence of a

13

registration certificate give a right for a valid

14

custodial arrest?

15

MS. SNDRKOWSKIs

I believe it does.

I believe

16

the statute — if there's a penalty, a second degree

17

penalty for failure to have it aboard and available,

18

upon that showing -- the officers are not really — even

19

having to board the boat is a matter of standing on

20

their own boat and asking do you have it.

21

matter of having to board the boat in this instance.

22

And if it's not available they can, in fact, arrest the

23

individuals because those statutes are very clear with

24

regard to —

MS. SNURKOWSKI;

I believe it is part of the

petitioner’s reply to the brief in opposition to

pleadings.

I think he can put that as part of his

because I was looking specifically at the applicable

There

statutes.

11

Once there was no response by the defendants

12

for the certification papers. Officer Soli, because of

13

the bobbing of the boats, asked if she could board the

14

boat.

15

statement at the suppression hearing and at trial that

16

the reason she was boarding was to help them find these

17

papers and also, to conduct a search, to do her duty, is

18

what she said.

19

20
21

At that point, consent was given and she made a

QUESTIONS

Didn’t she also say that really

what she was inspecting for was illegal seafood?
MS. SNURKOWSKIs

That came — there was a

22

statement to that effect later on, but she was initially

23

going onboard for was for safety inspection and to help

24

them find the papers.

25

with regard to papers.

They apparently were confused
They said no, they didn’t have

1

them, but they were not the owners of the boat, nor did

2

the papers that they did tender have their names on it.
QUESTIONS

3

Would it make a difference whether

4

the search was male for safety violations or for illegal

5

seafood ?
MS. SNURKOWSKIs

6

The search, the subsequent

7

search?

We have contended that there are three bases

8

upon which the Florida Supreme Court could have

9

legitimatized the search, and that the court missed its

10

mark, actually, when they found that the initial stop

11

was correct.

12

inspection was lawfully to ensue, and that by not

13

holding that that inspection was valid in this case,

14

they missed their mark.

We have contended first of all, that an

l

15

But secondly, we said that as the

16

circumstances developed in this case, and that is where

17

Officer Soli followed the respondents to the cabin area

18

of the boat, she asked if she could look into the ice

19

chest there, and they gave consent for that.

20

part of her inspection.

21

and finds that there are some bits of food that have

22

been rotting in there.

She opens it up, finds no ice

Now, this triggered —

I don’t remember it being

putrefying fish.

All I remember is rotten food.

3

that was what the record —

QUESTION!

HS. SNURKOWSKl!

But if

It smells the same.
Yes, I think it stinks.

The

point being —
QUESTION:

7

Suppose actually she was inspecting

8

only for illegal seafood, nothing to do with a safety

9

violation.

She hadn’t any authority to do that, did she?
HS. SNURKOWSKl*

10

She has authority — that’s

11

part of the scope of their authority, once they’re

12

lawfully aboard the boat.

13

QUESTION*

To inspect for illegal seafood?

14

HS. SNURKOWSKl*

15

QUESTION*

16

HS. SNURKOWSKl*

Pardon me?

To inspect for illegal seafood?
Part of their function, part

17

of the Harine Patrol function in Florida is to maintain

18

boating safety and to maintain the maritime, the

19

fisheries and control or regulate fishing in the area.

20

As a matter of fact, that is perhaps the majority of

21

their work.

QUESTIONS

1
2

No matter what the purpose of the

inspection is? .

3

MS. SNURKOWSKIs

The statute is very clear as

4

to the regulatory responsibilities and the duties of the

5

Marine Patrol with regard to investigating all

6

activities concerning marine life and boating.
As a matter of fact, they also have a general

7

8

proviso in their authority that they have the right to

9

investigate and arrest for all violations of law of

10
11

Florida.
QUESTIONS

As I understand it, there’s a state

12

statutory probable cause requirement, whether it's for

13

illegal fishing or for safety violations, is an act?

14

MS. SNURKOWSKIs

15

QUESTION:

16
17
18

I’m sorry, I didn’t hear.

Isn’t there a state statutory

probable cause requirement?
MS. SNURKOWSKIs

There’s a state statutory

requirement to board the boat; 371.58 says —

19

QUESTION*

Does that require probable cause?

20

MS. SNURKOWSKIs

It requires either consent or

21

probable cause to board the boat for a safety

22

inspection.

23

in this case had both the probable cause and consent to

24

board the boat for the safety inspection when the papers

25

were not produced.

The state would contend that the officers

There was something awry with this

boat, and that was sufficient probable cause to board
But more importantly, the record reflects, and
of course —
QUESTION:

I know, but if the holding is that

5

there was a probable cause requirement as required by

6

state statute, why doesn’t this case turn on an adequate

7

state ground; why do we have to get into it?

8

9

MS. SNURKOWSKIs ' Because the probable cause
that the Florida Supreme Court found the search to be in

10

violation of was a Fourth Amendment probable cause

11

finding as opposed to the state statute.

12

state statute is limited to boarding the boat for

13

inspection.

14

that you have to have consent of the owner or probable

15

cause for the officer, so he may board the boat to

16

conduct an inspection, to check safety equipment.

17

That is not the probable cause that the

particular case with regard to the searching of the ice

21

QUESTIOHs

Suppose — if we read what the

22

Florida Supreme Court says, that they turned this on the

23

statutory probable cause requirement, because that’s the

24

basis of it, —

25

MS. SN0RK0WSKI;

Well, they cite to two

They are, but they are not

squarely on what we're suggesting is the probable cause.
QUESTION*

I'm asking you if we don't read it

8

the way you suggest we should and we find that it did

9

rest on that state probable cause requirement, isn't

10
11

that the end of the case as far as we're concerned?
MS. SNURKOHSKIx

Hell, sir, I think — and to

12

answer your question is a yes/no proposition.

13

you really push me to the wall, but no because I believe

14

this Court has modified its review of an ambiguous

15

holding by a supreme court.

16

you did it, and apparently, and I really must admit —

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

QUESTION:

5

Oh, yes.

And the only argument that —
That we’re trying to get —

That you and Justice Brennan are

discussing is what occurs after that.
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

6

Exactly.

And I’m suggesting

7

that the probable cause of the statute, 371.58, does not

concern the search.

9

Amendment, which the Florida Supreme Court has always

That follows straight line Fourth

10

followed.

11

probable cause or consent, and that was what the statute

12

was to control.

13

But that initial boarding had to be either

QUESTION:

Is it not correct that insofar as

14

the Florida Supreme Court was talking about the boarding

15

and the stopping, it relied on federal cases.

16

when it got to the search, it cited the statute, and

17

from that point on in its opinion it cited nothing but

18

Florida cases.

19

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

And then

That is true, but I think

20

that is because only of its own practice of citing its

21

own decisions —.

22

case because the Third District Court of Appeals who

23

originally saw this on the appellate level did not even

24

address the search because they cut us off at the pass

25

when they nixed us on the initial stop.

There’s a problem in this particular

So therefore,

11

1

that particular issue was not developed.

developed when we got to the Florida Supreme Court and

3

we had lost.

It was only

But you're asking us to reverse the

5

portion of the Florida Supreme Court's opinion that

No, I don't believe that's

The majority cites nothing but Florida

16

this in this particular case.

Because clearly, clearly

17

QUESTION:

18
19

I suppose the answer is Florida

doesn't have to follow those cases if it doesn't want to.
MS. SNURKOWSKI:

20

Well, that is certainly one

21

outcome, but Florida has been — and there's a host of

22

cases starting with State versus Hetlin that have always

23

— and I repeat always — applied Fourth Amendment in

24

the same way Fourth Amendment is to be applied

25

federally.

I mean, that is the practice of the state.
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

As a matter of fact, our Article I, Section 12 is in

2

line with that, and as a matter of fact, we have just

3

modified — this last election year we had a referendum

4

to codify how we are going to interpret it, and that is

5

by seizing upon decisions of this Court in its

6

interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.

7

So as far as search and seizure is concerned,

8

we are following the Fourth Amendment, and if the court

9

is talking about it, I believe their opinion is

10

ambiguous at best, but certainly in the mode of the

11

Fourth Amendment review.

12

that this court does have jurisdiction in that vein.

And certainly, I would suggest

13

Once we're on the boat —

15

doubtful cases, we should assume there's jurisdiction?
MS. SNURKOWSKIj

You do agree this is a doubtful

of federal jurisdiction.

21

No, Your Honor.

You're saying that presumption should be in favor

MS. SNURKOWSKIs

I think this is a close case

22

to Delaware versus Prouse, and that case is the case —

23

you've accepted that, and I appreciate that in

24

yesterday's decision.

it, but there was a problem in that case.

I haven't had a chance to read

QUESTION;

It supports you.

2

MS. SNURKOWSKI:

3

(Laughter.)

4

I haven’t had a chance to read it but I

Yes.

5

thought it might.

But the point is that we don’t really

6

feel we have that kind of a problem in this particular

7

instance, and the history of the Florida Supreme Court's

8

review of the Fourth Amendment has always been under the

9

United States Constitution’s application of it.
QUESTION;

10

When the minority mentions the

11

federal cases and the majority ignores it, what

12

conclusion do I draw?
MS. SNURKOWSKI;

13

That the state was perhaps a

14

little remiss in its briefing of the case because we

15

were concerned with getting the stop found to be okay,

16

and we did not ever think in our mind that we would lose

17

the search.

came up to the Florida Supreme Court on certiorari

review, conflict certiorari review, regarding the

5

subject matter for grounds before this Court, was a

secondary issue that they fortuitously resolved.

The subsequent search, which became the

1

marijuana — the aroma of marijuana was everywhere and

2

apparently, leaf materials — it was just filled to the

3

gills with marijuana.

4

The state contends that the minority opinion

5

by the Florida Supreme Court that the case was instant

6

to a lawful arrest, that it was a probable cause search

7

and that, indeed, indeed, the search of the ice hold

8

would have been justified pursuant to an inspection type

9

check., all justified the search, and that the Florida

10

Supreme Court was incorrect in finding that there was no

11

consent and no probable cause.

12

I think a review of the decisions concerning

13

consent — and I think the reason I am going to consent

14

is that although the state never specifically argued

15

that consent was given to search the ice hold, even

16

though there was this kind of open statement like

17

there’s marijuana all over the boat, the state would

18

contend that the fact that somebody’s in custody, that

19

they’re not able to leave — the totality of the

20

circumstances must be reviewed, and in this particular

21

instance the consent was there.

22

But more importantly, the statement that was

23

given was not coerced in any way, fashion or form.

And,

24

therefore, there was sufficient — at that point, when

25

the officer heard that Garcia said there is marijuana
17

1

all over the boat, it developed the requisite probable

2

cause to conduct the search of the entire boat, as this

3

Court has suggested in Ross.

4

More importantly, as soon as Garcia and Mr.

Casal were under arrest, the search instant to a lawful

arrest was appropriate under Belton.

It is the position of the defendants that the

said I don't want to have our position rely strictly

upon the boarding or the illegality of the boarding of

the vessel, because of that point.

all.

Don't we judge this case on the grounds that the

3

officers were legally on the vessel?

4

MB. McCORMICK*

I believe so.

5

The icebox consent was given to look in the

6

icebox but no place else.

It was after the Marine

7

Patrol officer conducted a search of the wheelhouse, the

8

grocery box and the cabin and then the icebox that she

proceeded to the forward hold and indicated to Garcia

10

that she wanted to see what kind of fish products Mr.

Garcia said# do you have a search warrant.

It was then that Mr.

So you're saying there was no

MR. McCOBMICXs

not have been arrested for not having a boat

Yes, sir, that's correct.

The Florida Supreme Court opinion,

17

There’s no indication inside

of the decision of the Supreme Court that the arrest was

Suppose under Florida law it was

lawful, that having a registration certificate onboard

was required, and that you could arrest for not having

you don’t have a registration certificate so we’re

1

the next question is would they have the authority to

search the vessel.

3

you’re able to conduct a safety check with the owner or

4

operator’s consent, or when there has been reasonable

5

cause to believe that a part of that section has been

6

violated.

7

And Section 371.58 states that

Now, if there was a violation of the safety

8

requirements, then I say, yes, you could.

In contrast,

9

if you don’t have your registration papers onboard, is

10

that — for example, if you don't pay your income taxes,

11

I don’t think that would give them the authority to

12

search the forward hold.

13

don’t have the registration papers onboard, I don’t

14

think that would give them the right to search the

15

forward hold.

16

And by the same token, if they

So you're suggesting, which may be

17

quite right, that under Florida law, even if you need a

arrested for not having it, you may not search the rest

20

of the vessel, or search the vessel at all, unless you

MR. McCORMICK:

Yes, sir.

I believe that

2

would be consistent with the Carroll case, and I think

3

it’s also consistent with State versus —

4

QUESTIONS

Well, it isn’t.

Justice Stevens

5

suggested to you that the requirement of probable cause

6

is — that was imposed on these officers is purely

7

Florida law.

having a registration certificate.

9

MR. McCORMICKs

Even if they could have arrested for not

Well, that portion of the

10

decision, the last two pages of the opinion in chief,

11

that deals with the aspect of probable cause and the

12

arrest is that if all Florida statutes that they talk

13

about, together with the Hill case and I believe the

14

Taylor case and one other case, and they don't mention

15

anywhere —

16

QUESTION:

Is that the premise of your

17

argument that this judgment, then, rests on an adequate

18

state ground?

19

MR. McCORMICK:

Yes, sir, it certainly does.

20

In addition to that, our Article I, Section 12

21

of the Florida Constitution which was in force in 1977

22

and which was in force right straight through the trial

23

and the appeals up until last year, was a little bit

24

broader than the Fourth Amendment to the United States

25

Constitution.

Article I, Section 12 even stated that

any evidence that was obtained — that was unreasonable

2

could not be introduced in court proceedings.

QUESTIONS

What happened last year, Mr.

McCormick?
MR. McCORMICK:

5

Well, they changed the

6

constitution and now they're going along with the

7

Supreme Court of the United States.

8

QUESTIOHs

Florida changed its constitution?

9

MR. McCORMICKs

Yes, sir.

It's suggested by the state that the search

10
11

was incident to the arrest, and that area, I believe the

12

Chimel versus California is still the law here before

13

the Supreme Court is that there has to be, number one, a

14

lawful custodial arrest, is that there's been no

15

indication whatsoever that there was a lawful, custodial

16

arrest here.

17

And that the search be limited to an area into

18

which the arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon

19

or evidential item.

20

the arrest took place in the cockpit of the boat. The

21

forward hold is on the other side of the cabin.

22

a hatch.

23

strong men, to be able to lift the hatch, and before

24

they could even get to it, there's fish traps located on

25

top of the hatch that have to be removed.

Is that the forward hold -- is that

There's

The evidence is that it required two men,

So this would

1

certainly not be an area where the arrestee might reach

2

for a weapon or perhaps attempt to get some evidence and

3

destroy it.
The Carroll Exception is that — just briefly,

4
5

the probable cause for the arrest is that it's our

6

contention did not exist.

7

to believe that contraband was onboard.

8

testimony of Officer Soli and Officer Walker was that

9

they had no suspicion whatsoever that there was any

Nor was there probable cause
Is that the

10

contraband onboard.

As a matter of fact, they testified

11

that they just wanted to take a look in the forward hold

12

because they thought they might be able to locate some

13

lobster.
I don't know how they're able to say that

14
15

after they — assuming that they did find the seafood

16

products, that they could identify those seafood

17

products as either being stolen or perhaps legally

18

gained.
The evidence was also, by the testimony of the

19
20

officers, that they had no reason to believe that this

21

boat either fished in Florida waters or ever sold fish

22

products in Florida waters.
QUESTION»

23

25

Well, what were the traps doing

there?
HR. McCORMICKi

The traps were onboard the

boat, and they —
QUESTI0H;

2
3

You said they didn't fish, but what

were they doing with traps?
HR. HcCORHICK:

4

They stated that they were on

5

the way to the Bahamas.

6

located almost due east of Sugarloaf, approximately 40

7

miles into the stream.
The further position of the state is that this

8

9

It's a caysal bank, which is

was a lawful administrative inspection.

It's our

10

position that as far as it being a lawful administrative

11

inspection, Chapter 370 specifically states that the

12

only time that you can have an inspection is if there is

13

probable cause to believe that the conservation law has

14

been violated.

15

they had no reason whatsoever, even a suspicion, to

16

believe that the conservation law was violated.

And they, by their own testimony, stated

371 deals with registration papers and safety

17
18

equipment.

Is that it's the state's position now, which

19

I say lacks vitality because the first time it was

20

advanced was in their reply brief.

21

that — the state is contending that the probable cause

22

was gained by the lack of papers onboard, the

23

registration papers.

24

advance this, in their reply brief.

25

position, of course, that the failure to have

registration papers wasn’t — that doesn't give you the

2

probable cause to conduct the search.

3

It is the state’s position that the question

4

for review, as indicated in their brief on their

5

petition for certiorari, — it states that the

6

respondents were validly arrested.

7

Supreme Court of Florida so found that the respondents

8

were validly arrested, prior to the hold of the boat

9

being searched.

It stated that the

Is that nowhere in the opinion is there

10

any indication that the state Supreme Court thought that

11

the defendants were validly arrested.
And, of course, this is a pivotal point, is

12

13

that if you — it has to be established in the first

14

instance that there was a valid arrest.

15

everything else pretty much collapses.

Otherwise,

Lastly, the decision mentioned inside of the

16
17

defendants’ brief; namely, Bumper v. North Carolina,

18

which I believe is very similar to the case at bar, as

19

well as, of course, O.S. v. Moat, which is at 359 Fed

20

2nd, and O.J. Sales, Inc., which is a 99 Supreme Court

21

case.

22

misrepresentation, especially if it’s with reference to

23

a search warrant or it's represented to the defendant

24

that authority to search existed when, in fact, it did

25

not, is that any statements made as well as evidence

Is that similar in kind where there’s been a

received and especially consent ostensibly given does

2

not constitute consent at all.

3

And as was indicated in the case of State v.

4

Taylor, acquiescence to authority does not constitute

5

consent.

Thank you, gentlemen.
