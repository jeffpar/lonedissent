ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. LUCAS*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

That is all.

They also seized the sign-in

I was getting to the charge

I fail to see what they have to do

with the case.
MR. LUCAS:

11

They are just background about the

12

fact that he was then arrested, he was then charged

13

under the particular Virginia statute, the Virginia Code

14

18.2-71.

15

"except as provided” in the other sections that are

16

within the particular article.

17

language remarkably like the statutes from 1848 , the

18

first statute up through 1970, except the earlier

19

statutes were included in one paragraph, whereas — and

20

this was significant to the Virginia Supreme Court —

21

the current statute is in several different statutory

22

sections.

23

The statute defines as a felony any abortion

The statute is in its

The indictment, which is set out in the

24

jurisdictional statement, Pages 3 through 4, charged

25

only the violation of the one statute, the -71 statute.

which on its face declares all abortions illegal except

2

as provided in the other statutory sections.
The indictment did negate two of the separate

3
4

sections, the section pertaining to the length of

5

pregnancy and that the indictment alleged, and it was

6

not contested, that pregnancy was in the second

7

trimester.

8

whether the abortion had been performed in a hospital or

9

somewhere else.

The indictment also negated the question of

The indictment did not negate, however, the

10
11

74-1 section on medical necessity.

The prosecution

12

theory, as expressed in the indictment and in the

13

various arguments, particularly the closing argument at

14

449 of the Joint Appendix, was that the Commonwealth had

15

only to prove some act by the doctor with intent to

16

cause an abortion, and that that constituted the

17

sufficiency of the crime.

18

According to the prosecution theory, the crime

19

was essentially complete when P.?. left Dr. Simopoulos’s

20

American Women's Clinic, provided that she later

21

somewhere aborted, and provided that the prosecution was

22

able to connect up the saline installation procedure

23

with either the demise of the fetus or the abortion of

24

the fetus.

25

There was a bench trial in this case rather

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

than a jury trial, at which numerous arguments were

2

made, of which three have remained in our presentation

3

to the Court here.

4

about a day and a half, the defendant put on evidence to

5

challenge the constitutionality of the statute and to

6

challenge the arguments to challenge the defects in the

7

indictment and the definition of the offense.

In pretrial hearings that lasted

We called various expert witnesses to deal

9

with the question of whether there was any health or

10

other basis for the statute.

from Northern Virginia experienced with second trimester

12

abortions, as well as one particular gynecologist who

had conducted an extensive study on out-patient saline

MR. LUCAS*

Your Honor, the clinic does not

have a license as an out-patient hospital.

We submitted

22

in our reply brief — the Commonwealth raised for the

23

first time in this Court the question of whether the

out-patient hospital requirements would apply.

MR. LUCAS:

That's correct.

He never applied.

He was advised

interpretation would have been the same.
QUESTION;

But getting to my brother Powell's

20

question to you, could he have applied for certification

21

as an out-patient surgical hospital?

I would think that the

him later would have applied earlier.

QUESTION;

The Attorney General told him he

20

It is very

That’s correct.
But he never sought first

certification?
MR. LUCAS;

He did not attempt to apply for

that, and the state has never required him to.

The

state has treated him as a physician’s office where

QUESTION*

Well, what I am really getting to,

are there -- of the — I gather there are several

clinics rather than hospitals, abortion clinics, are

there not, in Virginia?

HP. LUCAS;

The record is quite silent on

that, but I am certain there are.
QUESTION*

All right.

And the record doesn’t

tell us how many, if any, of them have obtained
certification?
HR. LUCAS*

There is no evidence that a

12

facility performing second trimester abortions could

13

even obtain certification.

There is no evidence in the

14

record whatsoever of that.

The analysis of the

15

different out-patient licensing regulations might even

16

suggest that they are not applicable.

17

The Virginia Supreme Court at one point in its

18

opinion interpreted the abortion law to require

19

abortions at every stage to be inside the hospital.

20

That would seem to exclude any out-patient facility,

21

because the out-patient facility by definition.sends the

22

patients home at the end of the surgical procedure in

23

the afternoon.

25

The out-patient surgical hospitals

are described as hospitals under the Virginia

QUESTION;

Well, there is a category under the

12

Virginia regulations of out-patient surgical hospitals,

13

and I assumed that they were the places that under

14

Virginia law second trimester abortions normally would

15

be performed.

16

ME. LUCAS;

There is absolutely nothing in the

17

record or any of the health department reports or

18

anything to support that.

19

in the record to think that a second trimester abortion

20

has ever been performed in an out-patient surgical

21

hospital, and that is something that was never even

22

mentioned until this level.

Virginia Attorney General,

that there are very few facilities licensed as

that we would be able to show

We would show that according to the Attorney

6

General, they would not let Dr. Simopoulos obtain the

7

type of license for second trimester abortions he had

requested, because the Assistant Attorney General in the

9

letter in the reply brief told him he would have to

10

build a hospital.

And I would submit to the Court that

11

as far as this record shows, the only places where

12

second trimester abortions are done, certainly in

13

Northern Virginia, are in the two hospitals, the Fairfax

14

Hospital and the Alexandria Hospital.

May I ask you, Mr. Lucas, one other

question on the Virginia regulations, just to be sure I

understand it correctly?

that are abortion clinics in which only first trimester

23

abortions may be performed.

kind of license?

I would presume that applies
This was a

The Commonwealth never required him to apply

The evidence certainly in the record about Dr.

10

Simopoulos*s clinic would show that he had all of the

11

facilities that would have met the requirements of the

12

first trimester abortion clinic if there had been any

13

reason for him to apply for it.

14

Certainly the testimony of the expert

15

witnesses, I believe three of them actually went and

16

viewed his clinic before they testified in order to be

17

able to compare the type of facility that he had with

18

the type of facility that they utilized at the Fairfax

19

Hospital, and each of them testified that he had far

20

more extensive equipment.

21

qualifications one could have, not only the training in

22

GYN but the training in emergency medicine that he had,

23

and he had the extra equipment that would be necessary

that he preferred to have, equipment which was not at

The requirement that abortions be done within

2

the hospital stops at that point, and as the record in

3

this case shows, the hospital simply used a standard

4

treatment room with no special equipment in it

5

whatsoever.

6

One of the iocuments submitted by the

7

Commonwealth in their submissions, in the Virginia

8

addendum at Page 80, is the American College of OB/GYN

9

Technical Bulletin from 1976, which points out that

10

saline installation abortions can safely be done in a

11

standard treatment room, and I would submit that shows

12

to us that the facility that he had was far -- in far

13

better condition.

14

rate from the saline installation procedure, and that it

15

could even be cut in half using the various advanced

16

techniques which there was testimony that Dr. Simopoulos

17

was utilizing.

18

It also points out the low mortality

And that goes strongly in favor of cutting

19

against any health interests which the state has

20

offered, and the state has only made that contention

21

pertaining to the health interest.

22

The Commonwealth at the pretrial hearing

23

submitted no evidence whatsoever.

They did not call a

24

single expert witness in support of what burden they

25

would have to show a health interest of the state.

They

2

kind.

3

Virginia Supreme Court in its opinion ruled what I

4

believe is a clearly erroneous standard of review under

5

the decisions from this Court that the burden entirely

6

of showing the statute to be unconstitutional was cn the

7

defendant, on the physician.

8
9

They didn't call any witness of any

And they simply did not make any attempt, and the

The decisions of this Court have certainly
indicated that, from Roe v. Wade onward, that the

10

Commonwealth would have some burden of showing a

11

maternal health interest, showing a compelling interest,

12

showing that their regulations were narrowly tailored,

13

that they were reasonably related to maternal health,

14

and the Commonwealth in this case made no attempt

15

whatsoever to meet that burden.

16

QUESTION;

Do you get any guidance from the

17

cases in this Court about the constitutionality of

18

requiring second trimester abortions to be performed in

19

a hospital?

20

MR. LUCAS;

There have been mentions from time

21

to time in the Court's opinion from Roe and onward.

22

Most of the mentions I have seen in the opinions have

23

indicated in the second trimester regulations reasonably

24

related, to maternal health may be valid.

25

terminology.

Roe used that

Roe indicated there were various types of

might attempt to apply.
2UE3TI0N:

And one of them was what, a

hospital requirement?
MR. LUCAS:

indicate that the hospital requirement would be

considered valid.

14

anyone, and it was considered to be, I would think, a

15

guideline from the Court as one of the possible types of

16

regulations, as opposed to a definitive holding, since

17

the second trimester hospital requirement was not at

And the issue was certainly never addressed by

scrutinized the basis of restrictions and prohibitions

24

the state of Missouri to outlaw saline abortions, the

25

Court carefully examined the basis for that attempted

2

case, as later in Colautti, that the saline installation

who find themselves in the second trimester, and that

that time, the saline installation procedure had a lower

mortality rate than that of childbirth, which was one of

the important factors considered in the Danforth case.

10

Sow, that was on a 1974 record.

There have

11

been eight years of medical technology developments

12

since that time, which would only enhance the position

13

of the defendant in challenging the absence of any

14

maternal health basis for the statute at present.
We argued in our first primary point with one

We cited cases in our reply brief,

the Court gave broad standing to Hr. Baird to raise and

MR. LUCAS;

16

QUESTION;

Well, the trial -So aren't you basically just asking

us to reweigh evidence that has been already addressed

18

by two other courts?

19

MR. LUCAS;

Not at all.

There is no

20

indication that the trial court — the trial court did

21

anything other than put the full burden of persuasion on

22

the physician on medical necessity.
QUESTION:

24
25

How about the Supreme Court of

Virginia?
MR. LUCAS:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the burden of persuasion was on the prosecution,

2

but that is simply not what happened at the trial.
QUESTION;

3

Well, but we take the basic factual

issues pretty much as we get them from lower courts, and

5

6

reweigh the burden of proof or the weight of the

In the cases such as Sandstrom,

Well, that was an instruction to a

jury in a jury — in a case tried by a jury.
HR. LUCAS;

13

Well, Jackson v. Virginia

indicates that in a bench trial the same standards would

15

apply, that you would -- that the trial judge in a bench

16

17

Yes, and that is why I was asking,

are you asking us to reweigh the evidence in the case

to come forward with proof on that particular question.

QUESTION;

MR. LUCAS;

didn't they?
MR. LUCAS:

13

No, they didn't.

They addressed

the question pretty thoroughly.

The Commonwealth has

argued that he did not invoke it, but he invoked it very

16

clearly and it is raised in the Joint Appendix, 194

through

197.

QUESTION:

No, but does he just have to say, I

Is that all he has to do?

about medical necessity, and —

MR. LUCAS;

QUESTION;

Oh, yes, I am.
Hell, I don't understand.

Are you

17

taking the position that medical necessity is a matter

18

of defense which then shifts the burden of going forward

19

to the state, or are you taking the position that as

In this

Do you think the Virginia Supreme

8

Court approached -- construed the statute to indicate

9

that the absence of medical necessity was an element of

10

the crime?
MR. LUCAS;

11

So, they did not.

They construed

12

the statute so that there was only one element of a

13

crime, namely, an abortion being done, that everything

14

else was something that had to be invoked by the

15

defendant.
QUESTION;

16

Well, aren’t we -- must we not

17

accept that construction of the Virginia statute, and

18

then the question is, is it constitutional as so

19

construed?

20

MR. LUCAS;

Yes, accepting that construction

21

of the Virginia statute then takes you immediately into

22

the Roe v. Wade question of whether they can indict

23

people for every abortion in the Commonwealth, and that

24

is the central thrust of our first argument.

— the Virginia Supreme Court seemed to recognize it as

a defense.

is not.
QUESTION;

I know, but that is where

we are in this case, isn't it, on this issue, is whether

OEAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM G. BROADDUS, ESQ.,

22

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

23

MR. BROADDUS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24

please the Court, Virginia respectfully submits that

25

this Court may, and indeed that this Court should affirm

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia based upon

2

the law and the facts of this case.

3

substantially enlarging the Roe v. Wade right and

4

restricting the state's legitimate interest may the

5

Court have a basis for reaching a contrary result.

6

Only by

Because the Virginia statute under attack in

7

this case is drawn directly from the description in Roe

8

of legitimate and permissible state regulation, we

9

respectfully urge affirmance.

10

As Mr. Justice Rehnquist has indicated, there

11

are some difficulties with respect to standing in this

12

matter, and we respectfully urge the Court to focus only

13

on those factual situations in which Dr. Simopoulos has

14

a personal interest at stake, and not to permit him to

15

assert hypothetical bases for invalidating or alleging

16

the invalidity of Virginia statutes.

17

I believe that that is certainly consistent

18

with this Court's opinions in Harris v. McRae and in the

19

general line of cases.

20

believe, not be on point in this particular situation,

21

because that case involved a situation in which the

22

defendant in a criminal trial was permitted to assert

23

the rights of distributees of contraceptives.

24

persons who were receiving the product were not subject

25

to criminal prosecution, and would not have a forum to

So, that took that particular

2

situation out of the general standing proposition.

3

Turning to the major issue in this case,

4

Virginia law imposes with respect to second trimester

5

abortions only three conditions;

1

Yes, sir.

Now, with respect to

2

the letter, as you observed, that letter was written

3

after the facts, but I think it is also important to

4

note that it was written in response to an inquiry about

5

a certificate of need, which is an entirely different

6

procedure from certification as an out-patient hospital,

7

and also it was based upon the assumption, stated in

8

that letter, that Dr. Simopoulos was simply operating a

9

doctor's office, not a general surgical facility.
Sow, six weeks after that letter was written,

10
11

at trial, Dr. Simopoulos was asked the question as to

12

whether he had applied for an out-patient hospital

from what you have subsequently said that you are

MR. BROADDUS;

6

The Virginia abortion statute

7

does not define hospital.

As you noted earlier in a

8

question, that is defined elsewhere, and it includes

9

out-patient surgical facilities.

So, the abortion

10

requirement which requires hospitalization would be

11

satisfied by performing the abortion in a general

12

hospital, an acuta care hospital, or in an out-patient

13

surgical facility, which is also a hospital by

definition under the code.

Thera is disagreement, is there not?
HR. BROADDUS:

2

Based upon the Table 2 in Dr.

3

Simopoulos’s addendum and Table 20 in our addendum, I

4

believe that an analysis of all of the abortions and

5

natural childbirths over the same span of years would

6

yield that result, that it is at least equal to, if not

7

greater than.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, as I read the briefs, there

certainly is disagreement on that proposition.
HR. BROADDUS:

10

When one includes all abortions

11

performed in the first trimester, then certainly the

12

mortality rate will be lower, because that is 90 percent

13

of all the abortions, and the mortality rate there is

14

only one.

15

are certain procedures which may have lower mortality

16

rates than natural childbirth, but considering all of

17

the second trimester procedures together, the rate is at

18

least equal to, if not greater than.

As one goes into the second trimester, there

code of Virginia, which provides that hospitals may be

authorized and promulgated by the State Board of Health,

meeting certain specified requirements in the code.

1

saline amniocentesis, which is the procedure that was

2

used in this particular case, the mortality rate is

3

substantially higher than the mortality rate for live

4

birth, and as one considers the mortality rate for

5

second trimester abortions in relation to the mortality

6

rate for first trimester abortions, the mortality rate

7

for second trimester abortions is much higher.

Could the board or whoever issues licenses,

the authority under the statute to permit second

as the doctor was running without a license?

QUESTIONS

6

So it had no authority whatsoever

to exempt him from the licensing requirement.
MR. BROADDUSs

7

8

Not without a license.

That’s correct, sir.

It did

not.
Now, the American College of Obstetricians and

9
10

Gynecologists only this year changed its position from

11

that which was referred to in Roe v. Wade, and they have

12

suggested that there are certain limited procedures

13

within a certain limited time in the early part of the

14

second trimester of pregnancy which in their opinion may

15

be safely performed outside of general acute care

16

hospitals.

17

But they say that even those procedures should

18

be performed in out-patient facilities meeting the

19

requirements for surgical out-patient facilities as

20

prescribed by the states, and that they should be

licensed by the states.

HR. BROADDUS:

They are referred to. Hr. Chief

2

Justice, in the amicus brief filed by the American

3

Medical Association and the American College of

4

Obstetricians and Gynecologists in the other two cases

5

which the Court will hear this afternoon, and I believe

6

the reference specifically would be on Page 23 and 24 of

7

that brief.

8

Virginia would respectfully suggest that based

9

on H.L. v. Matheson, it is not encumbent upon it to fine

10

tune its statutes to facilitate abortions, but if fine

11

tuning is necessary to accommodate any proven medical

12

advances, which are not present in this particular case,

3

but if that were the obligation imposed upon us, then

4

certainly the legislature would be capable of making

5

such changes.
In this particular situation, even Dr. Cates,

6
7

who suggests that certain procedures could be safely

8

performed outside of hospitals, acknowledges in an

9

article printed on Page 101 of our addendum that other

authorities, to use his term, recommend that all

abortions in the second trimester be performed in

hospitals.

MR. EROftDDUS:

Certainly, sir.

Your fine tuning comment made me

think of this.

Is it not correct, though, that within

justification for regulating the procedure, namely,

MR. BROADDUS;

8

QUESTION;

9

Yes, sir.

Now, something in the record, I

can't remember what it is, indicated there were some

10

6,000 second trimester abortions performed in Virginia.

11

Is it safe to assume that the state is making sure that

12

all of those are performed according to the standards

13

that are — the health standards that you are

14

advocating?

15

MR. BROADDUS:

I believe, sir, that the

16

information in the addendum suggests that there are

17

approximately 3,000 abortions performed in the second

18

trimester, and that they were performed, or at least

19

there is other information in the addendum that suggests

20

that — I am getting somewhat confused on my facts.

ensure that they continue to maintain the standards that

they are required to keep.

11

of an enforcement program as such designed for this

particular procedure.

But if in fact a significant number

16

of them were not being performed in appropriate

I think, would arise as to whether the statute is in the

best health interests of the people involved.

20

MR. BROADDUS;

suggest, sir, that there is no information in the record

of this case that suggests that they are not uniformly

that brings up the medical necessity question.

Virginia Supreme Court has authoritatively construed the

Virginia statute, and it has decided, indeed, it decided

13

in 1966 or *67 in the Russo case, which it states in its

14

opinion, that the medical necessity issue is a matter

15

for the defense to assert, and once the defense asserts

16

it, then the burden is placed upon the Commonwealth to

17

prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no

18

medical necessity.

QUESTION;

20

MR. BROADDUS;

The

What is involved in the assertion?
That could be brought about

21

either through the cross examination of witnesses for

22

the prosecution, by the introduction of witnesses on his

own behalf, or through any other means which brings it

24

to the attention of the court and the prosecution.

25

QUESTION;

But it isn't necessarily fatal to

the state's case on its side of the case if it puts on

no evidence of necessity.
HR. BROADDUSi

3

That's correct, sir.

That's

4

absolutely correct.

Now, in this particular case,

5

counsel for Dr. Simopoulos argued that the indictment

6

was effective because it did not affirmatively negate

7

medical necessity, and that was the argument which I

8

believe the Court will find if it examines the

9

transcript.

I do not believe that the Court will find

10

an argument that the Commonwealth was affirmatively

11

under the constitutional obligation to prove in its case

12

in chief that there was no medical necessity.
Dr. Simopoulos we do not believe invoked that

16

Hr. Broaddus, may I ask you another

question about history?

Because when I first read this

statute, I understood it to require the procedure to be

performed in a conventional hospital, and I have since

learned that since 1977, at least, it is permissible to

perform it in these other licensed facilities.

procedure is predicted to work, in fact, it did work.

MR. LUCAS;

1

If I may further reply to Justice

2

Blackmun's question concerning whether she was told to

3

return or not, under the Virginia Supreme Court

4

interpretation of the statute, that might not make any

5

difference, but on Page 187 of the Joint Appendix, she

6

squarely admits that the doctor told her to go to the

7

hospital if she had severe cramps.

8

the instruction sheets, which were clear, and his two

9

phone numbers 24-hour-a-day were circled in there.

She never threw away

This question about ambulatory surgical

10
11

centers is extremely important, I think, to this

12

particular case, and it is unfortunate there was no

13

opportunity to respond to it in the lower courts or in

14

the trial or to put on a full exposition of it.

15

at the regulations, the Part 3 regulations on

16

out-patient hospitals actually require more extensive

17

extra technology than do the Part 2 on out-patient

18

surgical hospitals.

looking

In construing those regulations and reading

19

20

them as to what do they contemplate, there is no

21

indication whatsoever that the out-patient surgical

22

hospital scheme contemplates second trimester

23

abortions.

24

abortion has ever been done in an out-patient surgical

25

hospital.

There is no evidence that a second trimester
