ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, this case is here on the

10

government’s petition for a writ of certiorari to the

11

United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.

12

The issues in this case began when a drug task

13

force in Minnesota was investigating the activities of

14

one of Respondent's co-conspirators, one Armstrong, who

15

they had reason to believe was engaged in the

16

manufacture of illegal drugs.

17

that Armstrong was making purchases of certain precursor

18

chemicals used in the manufacture of amphetamine from a

19

particular drug company, and with the cooperation -- or

20

chemical company -- and with the cooperation of that

21

company, they placed a beeper or radio transmitter in a

22

false bottom in a five-gallon container of chloroform

23

which Armstrong was scheduled to pick up.

24
25

They acquired information

Armstrong came to the chemical company, picked
up the chloroform, loaded it in his car, and was then

1

followed by physical visual surveillance to the home of

2

co-defendant Petschen, where the container was seen to

3

be transferred into Petschen’s vehicle.

4

left and was followed both visually and with the use of

5

the beeper as he drove from Minnesota to Wisconsin.

6

one point during his travels on the road, the officers

7

lost both visual and beeper contact, but they regained

8

it while he was still in the course of his trip, and

9

then they lost it for a second time.

Petschen then

At

10

At that point, with the aid of an aircraft,

11

and after the passage of perhaps a half an hour to an

12

hour, the beeper was located emitting signals from the

13

property of Respondent Knotts.

14

surveillance over the course of a couple of days, and

15

then a warrant, search warrant was obtained to search

16

the property and the search disclosed a clandestine

17

laboratory to manufacture these chemicals, and of course

18

the chloroform container which contained the beeper and

19

various other precursor chemicals.

There followed a visual

The issue in this case is whether a warrant is

21

required to monitor the signals emitted by a beeper from

22

a container that has arrived at an individual's

23

property.

24

potentially two different kinds of inquiries.

25

whether the use of this investigative technique is a

The answer to this question involves

1

search or seizure at all, regulated by the Fourth

2

Amendment, and if the answer is no, that would, I think,

3

end this case.

4

what quantum of suspicion must exist to support the use

5

of this technique, and must such use be accompanied by a

6

warrant.

Secondly, if it is a search or seizure,

Now, before turning to these issues, I would

7

8

like to tell the Court briefly- something about how

9

beepers or beacons, as they are called, operate, and how

10

they are used.

It is basically an FM transmitter that

11

emits a radio signal which, when monitored, discloses

12

the location of the beeper.

13

the one in this case, that will also disclose when the

14

package is being moved or opened.

There are some beepers, not

15

A beeper is a fairly expensive device.

16

told it costs somewhere between $700 and $1,200.

The

17

kind of beeper used in this case is fairly small .

It

18

weighs about a half a pound, and is about three inches

19

long.

20

I am

There are essentially two ways in which these

21

devices are used.

One is attached to a vehicle or

22

vessel, car, plane,

23

the movements of that, and the second is placed in some

24

way inside a container or other object.

25

case, the basic purpose of this device is to be employed

or boat, for purposes of following

Now, in either

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

as an aid to surveillance to track movement.
Now, the container beeper is sometimes

2
3

employed for an additional purpose, in addition to

4

tracking the movement, which is to determine whether the

5

object,

6

place or, as I mentioned, in some instances, whether it

7

has been opened.
Now, car beepers are useful in a wide variety

8
9

the container remains located at a particular

of cases, kidnapping cases, espionage cases , extortion

10

cases, any kind of case where visual surveillance might

11

be important.

The container beeper —

QUESTION:

12

Is this device operated on a

13

particular wavelength or something?

14

others hear it besides those who are monitoring?

MR. FREY:

QUESTION:

Yes, but it is a —

19

QUESTION:

Only FM can pick it up?

20

MR. FREY:

I think you would need an

21

appropriate receiver.

22

but I think a receiver tuned to the right frequency

23

will, if it was close enough --

24
25

QUESTION;

I am not sure of the technology,

Is it any different fundamentally

from the directional signals given to airplanes to guide

It is much

QUESTION;

I don't think, it is.

But I take it -- could everyone in

the -- was it a house, wherever the chloroform vat was?

6

Where was that?

A barn or --

MR. FREY;

7

It was — it was discovered when

8

the search took place outside the cabin in a barrel,

9

under a barrel.

10

QUESTION;

11

to have been able to hear it?

12

MR. FREY;

13

Yes, but anyone in the cabin ought

If they had the right equipment and

tuned it to the right frequency.

14

QUESTION;

But not without the equipment.

15

MR. FREY;

No, but I think the equipment --

16

QUESTION;

It is a very high frequency signal,

18

MR. FREY;

I am not sure what frequency it —

19

QUESTION;

And you would have to — you would

17

isn't it?

20

really have to have some equipment that is tuned right

21

on that frequency.

22
23

MR. FREY:

Well, but there are scanners that

will scan a wavelength and pick up --

24

QUESTION:

But you would have to have that.

25

MR. FREY;

I suppose, yes.

MR. FREY i

You mean, in the way of

countersurveillance.
QUESTION:

5

6

I expect that will be the next

step.

3
4

QUESTION

Everybody in this business will

have something like this?
MR. FREY:

7

Well, it could be.

There are some

8

kinds of beepers called transponders which do not emit a

9

continuous signal, and only emit a signal when you

10

activate them, and they are less subject to being

11

discovered by these means.

12

QUESTION:

Intercepted.

13

MR. FREY:

In any event, fortunately, this

14

mode of countersurveillance is not extensive at this

15

point.

16

QUESTION:

It will be if it is sustained.

17

MR. FREY:

Well, that may be, although for a

18

number of years these devices have been being used, and

19

with considerable success.

20

QUESTION:

Hr. Frey, do we focus in this case

21

on the use of the beeper to locate the cabin, or the use

22

of the beeper to locate the barrel on the premises?

23

MR. FREY:

No, the cabin itself.

What was

24

held to be improper by the court of appeals was the

25

monitoring of the beeper while it was on the property.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

The only piece of information that was used, that was

2

garnered from the beeper that was relevant to the search

3

warrant application, and this is a fruits case -- nobody

4

questions that the warrant itself was supported by

5

probable cause — was the knowledge that the container

6

of chloroform was on Respondent Knotts's property.
Now, the beepers are, as I say, expensive.

7

8

Their use is hardly an everyday occurrence.

Its use is

9

usually accompanied by airplane surveillance, car

10

surveillance by a number of agents.

But although it is

11

not frequent, it is hard to estimate its utilities.

12

is absolutely essential in investigations like this that

13

the existence of surveillance not be discovered by the

14

suspects.

It

15

And in this case, as in many others, suspects

16

do use countersurveillance techniques, erratic driving,

17

sudden U-turns, and various other things to try to

18

detect the presence of and to throw off visual

19

surveillance.

20

need to maintain eye contact with the vehicle that you

21

are following and are able to mount a more effective

22

surveillance of the public movements of the car on the

23

highway.

24
25

With the use of the beeper, you do not

Also in the drug manufacturing cases such as
this, it is common practice for the suspects to acquire

chemicals gradually, store them at various locations,

2

move them from place to place.

3

will be acquired 1,000 miles from where the laboratory

4

is to which they are ultimately transported, and the

5

maintenance over a period of time of physical

6

surveillance would be incredibly costly and very

7

difficult to do without being detected.
Now, turning to the specific legal issues in

8
9

Sometimes the chemicals

this case, there are two somewhat different types of

10

issues raised, as I mentioned, one, whether there is a

11

search, and second, what procedures and quantum of

12

suspicion would be necessary if it was.
QUESTION;

13
14

Do you mean whether there is a

search when the beeper is affixed to the —
NR. FREY;

15

No, there is no issue in this case

16

of that, and indeed at the time it would belong to the

17

chemical company.

18

monitoring of the airwaves by the receiver which picks

19

up the signal which is being emitted by the beeper is a

20

search.

21
22
23

The question is whether the

QUESTION:

24

render the whole investigation impossible.

25

a search in the traditional sense.

This is not

It is not the

1

uninvited eye or uninvited ear that is seeing or hearing

2

what is going on in private areas.

3

examined in this search is the airwaves around the

4

receiver being operated by the officers.

5

In fact, all that is

Now, of course, Katz teaches that even such

6

activity may be considered a search regulated by the

7

Fourth Amendment, but whether it is depends on whether

8

what is disclosed by this kind of activity is private or

9

non-private information.
QUESTION:

10
11

What is the range of this signal?

Does the record show that?
HR. FREY:

12

I am told that it is normally, in

13

open country, about two to four miles on the road, and

14

in the city it may be only several blocks.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Any open field questions in this

HR. FREY:

No , I don’t believe the Court has

case?

18

to deal with any in thi s case.

19

because from the air th e signal can be picked up at a

20

longer distance, and th e range, I am told, is 20 to 50

21

miles, and that is why you often lose track in the

22

automobile surveillance , because you are not keeping eye

23

contact, and if the sus pect gets two or three miles away

24

from you, you may lose the signal.

25

QUESTION:

Aircraft are used

I take it it is not just- a matter

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of distance, but it is a direct line from the

2

transmitter to the receiver, so if you had obstacles in

3

the way --

4
5

6

ME. FREY;

And whether there are obstacles in

the way, yes.
Now, this question of whether this use of the

7

beeper in this case was a search is quite similar to the

8

issue the Court confronted in Smith against Maryland,

9

which involved the monitoring by use of a pen register

10

of phone numbers dialed from the suspect's home.

11

Court held that it was not a search, in large part

12

because the information acquired was not private

13

information.

14

transmitter to follow the co-defendant's car while it

15

moved on the public highways would not be a search, and

16

indeed neither the court of appeals nor Respondent has

17

suggested otherwise.

QUESTION;

Do you see any analogy between this

19

and having an airplane, a helicopter dust follow them by

20

visual contact?

21

MR. FREY;

Well, it is similar. •

22

QUESTION;

Are these searches?

23

MR. FREY;

Of course, if you foil owed them

24

closely , they would know that they were bei ng followed

25

and it would affect the effectiveness, but it is —

Well, let's make it an automobile

It is similar to, let's say,

the car to facilitate visual surveillance.

6

being learned from an automobile beeper or from the use

7

of the container beeper in this case was the movements

8

of a vehicle on the public highway, including the

9

turning onto any private property.

What is

Those things are not

10

private events.

11

knowing those things, and under the analysis in Smith,

12

those things are not a search.

13

Nobody has a right to keep people from

Now, I think the court of appeals even

14

suggests, and I am not sure that Respondent contests

15

that if they had managed in this case to maintain

16

continuous surveillance, beeper surveillance of the

17

vehicle as it went across the roads and ultimately onto

18

Knotts's property, there would have been no Fourth

19

Amendment problem.

20

The problem arose because they lost track of

21

the vehicle and of the beeper, and by the time they

22

turned it on, it was situated on Knotts's property, and

23

the court in effect takes a strict liability position,

24

that the government has no way of knowing, of course,

25

where the container is, because only by using the beeper

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

do you find that, but the government is out of luck if

2

when they use the beeper the container is then located

3

on private property.

4

Now, the situation that Respondent wishes to

5

analogize this case to is the situation in which a

6

beeper is used to monitor, let's say, the continued

7

presence over an extended period of time of a container

8

inside somebody's house, or to monitor such activity

9

inside somebody’s house as the opening of a container.

10

Those things are different, because those are not public

11

events, and arguably those things would properly be

12

classified as a search under the Katz test.

13

But in this case, the only fact that was used,

14

the court of appeals held was tainted in getting the

15

warrant was the fact that Petschen's car had driven with

16

the container onto Knotts's property.

17

Now, I will assume from now on that something

18

that happened here is held to be a search,

19

discuss the questions that arise in that event, and

20

there are basically two.

21

22

QUESTION;

and I want to

The first question --

Before you go on to the second

issue, Mr. Frey --

23

MR. FREY;

Yes.

24

QUESTION;

-- can I ask you this question?

25

You have described it as though the question is whether

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the monitoring of the beeper is the focus of the

2

inquiry.

3

MB. FREY:

Yes.

4

QUESTION;

What if we focused instead on the

5

question of whether the installation of the beeper was

6

not the act which gives rise to the question whether

7

there is an invasion of privacy of some kind?

8

9

MR. FREY;

Well, there would be in these

chemical company cases no standing, if I may use that

10

term, to complain about the installation, and in the

11

automobile cases where there is a nominal —

12

QUESTION;

Confining it to container beepers

13

for the moment, would your argument be just as strong,

14

do you think, if instead of having the consent of the

15

manufacturer and so forth, you had waited until there

16

had been a transfer of title to the purchaser, and then

17

somehow it was left in an abandoned place and an agent

18

was able to insert a beeper.

19

be the same case?

20
21

22
23

MR. FREY;

Would you say that would

I think it would depend on whether

the insertion of the beeper required an opening and -QUESTION;

Assume it did not.

Assume there is

some way to stick it on the bottom or something.

24

MR. FREY;

I think it would be the same case.

25

QUESTION;

You think it would be the same

case ?

2

HP. FREY;

It would --

3

QUESTION;

It would be the same case as the

4

automobile case.
MR. FREY;

5
6

It would be the same as the

automobile case, and in both cases I would say that —
QUESTION;

7

But the difference is, in the

8

automobile it is not going to go in anybody's home,

9

whereas by hypothesis this may.
MR. FREY;

10

Hell, but whether it -- the

11

importance of it being in somebody's home has to do with

12

the monitoring of activities inside the home.

13

that it goes into the home is of no consequence except

14

insofar as you learn something that is going on inside

15

the home by virtue of use of the beeper.
QUESTION;

16

The fact

Well, you learned here by using the

17

beeper that the chemicals went into this cabin, I guess

18

it was, and you are pretty sure -MR.

19

FREY;

We don't know whether it went into

20

the cabin.

What we know is only what we could have

21

learned if we had been able to maintain visual

22

surveillance, which is that they were carried to this

23

cabin.

24

outside the cabin, and we did not in this case use, as

25

has been done in some other cases, use the beeper to

We don't know whether they were in the cabin or

1

monitor continued presence over a period of time.
QUESTION:

2

Well, the information gained by use

3

of the beeper plus your additional information was

4

rather persuasive that the thing was inside the cabin.

5

I mean, because you had probable cause to go in the

6

cabin.
MR. FREY;

7

It was persuasive to establish that

8

there was a clandestine -- probably a clandestine

9

laboratory present at the cabin.

10

In fact, we expected

and found --

11

QUESTION:

That's how you got the warrant.

12

MR. FREY:

-- much more than just the can of

13

chloroform.

14

and --

15

We found thousands of dollars of equipment,

QUESTION:

The question I am leading up to is

16

whether — I wonder whether you think, given all the

17

information you had, at the time the beeper was

18

installed, you might have then gotten a warrant which

19

would authorize an entry into the place where the

20

container went.

21

MR. FREY:

Well, I have a couple of

22

difficulties that I think should be pointed out. about

23

the warrants in this case.

24

later, but I will get to it now.

25

I was going to get to that

One of the problems is that you cannot comply

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with the particular ity requirement of the Fourth

2

Amendment, because you cannot particularly describe the

3

place to be searche d.

4

41 is that it will often be the case that the magistrate

5

or judge to whom yo u go will not have authority to

6

authorize a search wherever the container may end up.

7

In this case, the o nly time we could have gotten a

warrant was in Minn esota.

Now, the court could craft, or Congress, if it

12

13

wished, I think., wo uld clearly have the power to craft

14

some procedures to regulate the use of beepers, but it

15

is certainly not ea sy without bending the Fourth

16

Amendment's warrant clause somewhat to have a beeper

17

warrant in this kin d of case.

18

QUESTION;

Well, the beeper sort of ends up as

19

the -- what do you call it, the affidavit in a search

20

warrant.

21

MR. FREYi

Excuse me?

22

QUESTION;

The beeper ends up as a sort of

23
24
25

affidavit in suppor t of a search warrant.
MR. FREY;

The beeper provides us with a fact

that is useful --

1

QUESTION:

That's what I mean

2

ME. FREY:

-- in obtaining a search warrant.

3

This is another point about the warrant that I think, is

4

important, is that in the vast majority of these cases,

5

when a real search takes place, there will be a warrant

6

procured, and all the information that would have been

7

presented to the magistrate to get the beeper warrant

8

will be reviewed, and if that information did not make

9

out probable cause, unless more information has been

10

acquired that does contribute to probable cause, a

11

warrant won't be obtained.

12

In any event, this whole procedure will not

13

ordinarily be free of some kind of meaningful judicial

14

review before there is a really intrusive search into

15

private property.

16
17

QUESTION!

Now -Well, you have already invaded the

private property with the beeper.

18

HR. FREY:

Well, yes.

19

QUESTION;

That could be argued, couldn’t it?

20

MR. FREY:

We have placed the beeper in and

21

the property becomes at some point the Respondent's

22

private property, although not until it went through

23

several hands and landed at his property.

24

understand the graviman of Respondent's argument in this

25

case to be that it was the search of his home from

But I

1

monitoring the beeper signal that violated the Fourth

2

Amendment, ana so I have been addressing my argument

3

principally to that contention, and that, I think, is

4

what the court of appeals found.
And I do believe that that is the only viable

5

6

contention that could be made in this area.
Now, if this is a search, there are two

7

8

questions.

Is probable cause necessary to support the

9

search, or can it be done on reasonable suspicion, or

10

something less?

11

warrant required?

12

the most important as a practical matter is the question

13

of whether it can be conducted on reasonable suspicion.

14

And if probable cause is required,

is a

Now, of these two questions, by far

And in fact, as a practical matter, if the

15

Court holds there is a search, it will cause no problems

16

if it allows it to proceed on the basis of reasonable

17

suspicion, because this simply is not a device that is

18

used on a random basis without a substantial basis for

19

expecting that it will produce evidence useful in a

20

criminal investigation.

21

So, as a practical matter, although there are

22

theoretical problems with holding this a search, as a

23

practical matter, the important question for us is

24

whether these devices can be used on the basis of a

25

reasonable suspicion of criminal activity --

QUESTION;

Mr. Frey, I don't mean to interrupt

2

too often, but I want to be sure I understand.

3

say holding this to be a search, you are saying holding

4

the monitoring of the beeper as opposed to the

5

installation of the beeper.

6

MR. FREY;

Yes, sir.

When you

I don’t understand there

7

to be a contention in these cases — in this case that

8

the installation of the beeper is a search, and indeed,

9

I don’t — it does not disclose any fact.

It is

10

completely blind until you turn on your receiver and

11

listen to it.

12

So I —

QUESTION;

So your argument is directed to the

13

case in which we assume sort of as a starting premise

14

that there is nothing wrong with the installation , it is

15

just how long can you listen to it, and when, if ever ,

16

dees listening to it become a search.

17

MR. FREY;

Yes, it is addressed to that .

And

18

I might note that where, for instance, with aircraft

19

transponders, where you have to enter the aircraft in

20

order to implant the device, we normally do get a

21

warrant, and we would recognize the entry into the

22

aircraft and the exposure to official view of the

23

interior of the aircraft as being a search.

24
25

QUESTION;

Would the installation of this

electronic device be in principle different from

1

planting an undercover agent in the laboratory who would

2

then send out signals to locate the place?
MR. FREYi

3

Well,

there is not the same --

4

There are two differences.

One is, the undercover agent

5

sees an awful lot more than this beeper discloses.

6

the other hand, the undercover agent is presumably there

7

with some kind of knowing consent that the defendants in

8

this case did not have.

9

he is an undercover agent.

That is, they may not know that

Now, there is an analogy.

10

On

I mean, you might

11

say that they know that this is a can of chloroform that

12

they are taking, but they don't know that it is a

13

disloyal can of chloroform.

under Katz with the notion that that argument would

15

really carry the day for us.
QUESTION;

16
17

Well, you did monitor this beeper

when it was in the house, as far as you -MR. FREY;

I have some difficulty

No, we don't know whether it was in

the house or net.

QUESTIONS

What happened after that?

3

MR. FREYs

What happened after that was, we

4

established visual surveillance for a couple of days to

5

-- It is very important in these manufacturing cases —

6

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

7

MR. FREY;

— to catch as many conspirators as

8

possible together, and because they have to get pretty

9

far along before there is a prosecutable attempt, you

10

preferably want to catch them when they are in the

11

process of manufacturing.

12

13

QUESTION;

In fact, it was found outside the

house, was it not --

14

MR . FREY;

It was.

15

QUESTION;

-- the can?

Do you agree, Mr.

16

Frey, that if the beeper had been used to monitor at the

17

location of the barrel on the premises, to tell you

18

where it physically was located, for example, within the

19

house, that that would constitute a search?

20

MR. FREY;

Well, T would certainly say that

21

that would be a different case, and I think there would

22

be a much stronger argument for the proposition that

23

that would be a search.

24
25

QUESTION;

Well,

would you agree that it is or

is net, rather than just a tougher case?

MR. FREY;

argue that case when it arose, but I think a lot depends

3

on what information is actually learned, but I think —

QUESTIONj

You locate it in the bedroom of the

withdraw any such concession if a case came along and --

10
11

QUESTION;

Is that practical to locate — to

have a directional finding that accurately?
MR. FREY;

I don't know enough about the

12

technology to know that, but this case does not involve

13

learning anything except that this container was taken

14

to Knotts's property.

15

QUESTION:

Why don't you let us be the judge

16

of what this case involves knowing about?

17

would like to know a little bit more about the beeper

18

than you've told us so far, about how it does monitor

19

and that sort of thing.

how far away is the thing that is monitoring the thing,

how does it monitor?

25

MR. FREY;

I for one

I think this kind of broad,

Well, what I can tell you about

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this is that the beeper emits a signal at regular

2

intervals, just a blip that may be at a two-second

3

interval, and by the strength and direction of that

4

signal, you can locate the — where it's coming from.

5

Now, as I mentioned before, from ground

6

surveillance, normally it will carry about two to four

7

miles in open country, so that if — anybody who was

8

tuned to the right frequency within that distance could

9

pick up this signal.

From the air, I am told 20 to 50

10

miles is the distance on which you can monitor it.

you get is blip, blip, blip, which says, I am here, I am

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. PETERSON/ ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. PETERSON;

11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

12

please the Court, before going to the issues and facts

13

involved in this case, I would like to identify two

14

things which in my view represent the -- or reflect the

15

extreme position which the government is taking in this

16

case .

17

First of all, in their main brief, they assert

18

that neither the history nor the language of the Fourth

19

Amendment reflects any intention to require warrants as

20

a precondition to a lawful search and seizure.

21

is difficult for me to imagine any constitutional rule

22

which has been established by this Court other than that

23

searches without warrants are per se unreasonable,

24

subject only to a few specifically established and well

25

delineated exceptions, none of which, by the way, are

Now, it

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

claimed here
Second, in their reply brief, the government

3

strongly criticizes an observation which we made in our

4

main brief to the effect that if this Court allows

5

warrantless beeper monitoring in any situation, which is

6

in essence what the government is asking for here, that

7

rule would allow virtually unlimited monitoring of our

8

private lives.

9

Pursuing that, in their reply brief, the

10

government suggests that what we are attempting to do is

11

to divert the inquiry which is made in this case into a

12

question of potential for abuse, further accuses us of

3

conjuring up what they call a pessimistic vision of

4

police activities which is far removed from reality.

5

QUESTION!

What would you say, Nr. Peterson,

6

if in a kidnapping case, for example, all of the bills

7

were impregnated with some chemical which would get onto

8

the fingers and hands of anyone who touched it and could

9

not be removed for quite a long time, but was something

20

that could not be observed?

21

the unfolding that we have here?

22

an invasion of privacy, too?

23
24
25

ME. PETERSON;

And that led ultimately to
Would you say that was

I would not call that an

invasion of privacy, at least not an illegal —
QUESTION:

Would it have a negative -- Would

1

it have the consequences you are arguing for here?
HR. PETERSON*

2

No, it would not have the

3

consequences I am arguing here, because that would be a

4

permissible police or bank practice which would be

5

allowed under the exigencies of the situation.

6

Obviously, when someone goes in to rob a bank., whether

7

it was the bank or the police officers responsible for

8

placing this material on the bills which would end up on

9

the hands, there would have been no time to get a

10
11

warrant.
QUESTION;

All right.

Now let's change it to

12

money bags, a whole lot of money bags that are in a

13

Brinks truck or in a bank.

14

some way with an electronic device such as was used

15

here, and then the property was stolen either from the

16

bank or from the Brinks truck, and it is followed, just

17

as it was here.

18

And the bags are equipped in

What would be your analysis of that?

MR. FETERSON;

Well, no warrant would be

19

possible in that case, Your Honor, because once again we

20

would have an exigent circumstance where it would not be

21

possible to obtain a warrant.

22

case that following --

23

QUESTION*

We have conceded in this

Well, but the warrant -- let’s

24

assume that just as here, after this signal came to rest

25

in one place, in the same manner as it was monitored

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

here, then the police or the agents move in with a

2

warrant which they have got on the basis of the

3

electronic signal.

4

MR. PETERSONi

We would have a more difficult

5

case in that instance, Mr. Chief Justice, because of the

6

fact, number one, the bag o f bank money would be

7

contraband in itself.

8

10
11

QUESTION;

The person who took it -Why is it contraband?

Money is

innocent in and of itself, and very good in the minds of
most of us.
MR. PETERSON:

It is stolen property, though,

12

and in that situation he wo uld have no right to possess

13

it, whereas in our situatio n here, the defendant had the

14

right to possess the can of chloroform,

from the money?

Because it is -- stolen money

is contraband per se.

5

illegitimate or illicit purpose.

not as much contraband as the money, assuming the money

is contraband, which I am not sure of?
MR. PETERSONi

10

Well, the money, Mr. Chief

11

Justice, is something which the defendant in that case

12

would clearly have no right to possess.

13

here was a material lawfully possessed which was subject

14

to forfeiture because it could be and obviously was

going to be utilized in the illegal drug factory, so —

1

Justice, I meant to say --

2

QUESTION:

You said —

3

MB. PETERSON:

-- that it is subject to

4

forfeiture, which means that it could have been taken

5

away from him if it were determined that it was going to

be used for an illegal purpose.

a

you do not challenge that it was to be used for that

9

illegal purpose.

I do not challenge that, and

11

for purposes of this case,

12

any difference.
QUESTION:

13

I don't think that it makes

Mr. Peterson, I suppose the state

of origin could require a purchaser of precursor

chemicals as part of the regulatory scheme, could it

not ?

18
19

20

MR. PETERSON;

I would imagine that they

could, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION;

So how is use of the beeper to

21

determine where the chemicals went different from the

22

state requiring that diclosure in the first instance?

23

MR. PETERSON:

Well, the mere fact. Justice

24

O'Connor, that someone would write down their name and

25

their address and where a particular chemical is going

1

obviously does not mean that it would necessarily end up

2

there, but --

,

QUESTION;

3

Well, they might lie about it, I

4

suppose, but we are talking about the basic interests at

5

stake here, and what greater interest in the ultimate

6

destination of the chemicals does the owner of the

7

property have than he would have if the state asked in

8

the first instance when they were purchased where it was

9

going,
MR. PETERSON:

10

He does not have any greater

11

interest than he would have in that situation, and the

12

government would still have to get a search warrant

13

before they went into his house to seize those -QUESTION:

14
15

Sure, and the government did that,

based on this information.
Let me ask you another question, Mr.

16
17

Peterson.

18

agents had been better drivers, they would have been

19

able to follow the vehicle in the first place, and

20

discover that it had arrived at the cabin with the

21

barrel of chemicals.

22

I guess you agree that if the narcotics

MR. PETERSON;

In the hypothetical sense, that

23

is true, Justice O'Connor, but in this situation, I

24

don't think it can be shown to be true by the record,

25

because as the record will show here, the reason that

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

surveillance was terminated in the first place was

2

because the co-defendant was eng aged in what the agents

3

determined to be evasive driving, and therefore they cut

4

it of f.

5

From that, I think it is fair to assume that

6

had they continued to follow him as he drove in the

7

rural area of Wisconsin, he probably never would have

8

gone to the Respondent’s home in this case.

9

QUESTION!

Mr. Peterson, help me a little.

10

Why didn't you object to putting the beeper in in the

11

first place?

12

MR. PETERSON:

Justice Marshall, I am not sure

13

I understand at what point —

14

QUESTION:

I understand that you have no

15

Fourth Amendment problem with the putting of the beeper

16

in the container.

17

MR. PETERSON:

18

QUESTION;

No.

I am sorry —■

And your Fourth

Amendment problem

19

does not come up until the private home is involved.

20

That is your position.

21

MR. PETERSON:

The reason that no objection to

22

installation of the beeper in the drum of chemicals was

23

made is that it was purchased by a second co-defendant,

24

then transferred to the first co-defendant, and

25

therefore we would have no "standing" to object to

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

something that happend to someone else's property.

2

is why it was not raised at an earlier stage.
QUESTION;

3

Well,

I am not sure that is an

4

adequate answer, because he was held not to have any

5

12

for the purposes of the decision in this ca se, it makes

13

no difference.

14

One thing the government has clai med here in

their brief is that they suggest that warra nts should

not be required for beepers here, because i n any case

19

true, that the police would have no way of knowing where

20

a beeper which is installed either on a car , in a

21

chemical drum, or have you, would end up, b ut I think

22

that it is rathar disingenuous to assert th at here,

23

because prior to installation of the beeper in this

case, they had already located one clandest ine drug

seek in this case would not prevent the warrantless use

of beepers only to assist surveillance which is

generally the use to which beepers are put.

On what basis would a magistrate

issue a warrant for a lawful, innocent drum of

MR. PETERSON;

Well, once again,

these cases

12

do not arise generally or at least in my experience

13

until the agents already have some substantial

14

information that one or more people are apparently

engaged in the illegal manufacturing of drugs, or at

least they are purchasing large guantities of chemicals

which are consistent with the manufacture of drugs.

MR. PETERSON;

Well, if the agents were putting it

it for the purpose of following that airplane to see if

MR. PETERSON;

That's correct. Your Ponor, but

again, this goes back to the fact that you can follow

they run it into a hangar, to conceal it from the air,

would be a far more difficult one for me to argue than

17

this case is, but I still would submit that there is a

colorable claim that even in that hangar, assuming that

19

it was the person's living quarters, he would have a

20

colorable claim of Fourth Amendment protection.

Parallel to this case, or not?
Pardon me?

Parallel to this case?
Well, there certainly are a
The case that you have posed

I would like to comment just briefly on a

21

22

couple of things that came up during the government's

23

argument.

24

like this, in other words, drug manufacturing cases,

25

beepers are essential.

First, Mr. Frey has asserted that in cases

I have no doubt as to the

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

accuracy of that statement, but that certainly is no

2

justification and no reason for claiming that it is

3

difficult to get a warrant.

4

Secondly, the government asserts that all that

5

was learned through use of the beeper was that ttr.

6

Petschen went to the cabin after they lest surveillance

7

contact with him.

8

in this case, the basis of the search warrant was the

9

fact that the beeper drum had been -- had become

I think, it is important to note that

10

stationary at the Respondent's residence, and that was

11

one of the bases upon which they obtained the warrant.

12

I want to make it clear that we do not

13

necessarily concede that merely because Petschen may

14

have arrived at Knotts' property, even assuming that the

15

state agent saw that, that that would have established

16

probable cause.

17

One thing that also came up during the

18

government's argument in questioning by Justice

19

O'Connor, your questions to the effect that, does it

20

make any difference where the beeper drum is located on

21

the property for purposes of determining whether or not

22

position in this case that once the drum was on the

24

curtilage of this property, which, as the record shows,

The reason I suggest that I am not sure that

the trespassory part of Hester has survived Coolidge

has not been disapproved by this Court.

The government also takes the position in this

which occurs is thereby minimal, and it should not be

I would submit to this Court that "here I am"

In conclusion, ever since this Court's

In his famous dissent in the Olmstead case,

citizen's privacy, the Fourth Amendment is violated.

He wrote essentially that whenever and

Now, ever since Olmstead, much constitutional
