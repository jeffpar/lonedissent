ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PHILLIPS*

7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

8

and may it please the Court, this is a suit arising

9

under the Federal Tort Claims Act, and specifically the

10

issue is whether a suit against the United States

11

alleging that a federal employee negligently inspected a

12

home purchased from a private developer but with federal

13

moneys is a claim arising out of a misrepresentation and

14

therefore barred under the Federal Tort Claims Act,

15

specifically. Section 2680(h) of the Act.
The Farmers Home Administration is an agency of

16
17

the Department of Agriculture which, among other

18

services, provides loans to low income rural housing

19

residents to assist them in purchasing safe and decent

20

housing.

21

granted Respondent’s application for a loan, and

22

Respondent then entered into a contract with a private

23

developer -- the name of the company is Home Marketing

24

Associates, Inc. -- to purchase a prefabricated house.

25

The purchase price of the house was approximately

In 1977, the Farmers Home Administration

1

$21,000

During the construction of the house, and in

2

3

accordance with Farmers Home Administration regulations,

4

a county employee of the Administration inspected the

5

house when it was 2 percent completed, 99 percent

6

completed, and 100 percent completed.

7

she signed an inspection report indicating that there

8

were no major deviations from the housing plan and

9

specifications that she discovered in her inspection.

On each occasion,

Each inspection lasted between 10 and 30

10
11

minutes.

12

the final inspection, and Respondent signed the final

13

inspection.

14

Ms. Wells and Respondent both participated in

Two months after Respondent moved into her

15

house, she notified the Farmers Home Administration that

16

she was having difficulties with the heat pump that had

17

been installed.

21

QUESTIONS
inspection,

It really wasn't much of an

was it?

MR. PHILLIPS;

No, sir, it was not the best

inspection that one could have hoped for.

22

A second inspector went out to the house and

23

discovered that the heat pump that had been installed

24

was not the same heat pump that had been provided in the

25

plans and specifications, that it was indeed a

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

significantly smaller heat pump than they had

2

anticipated, made by a different manufacturer.
In addition, that inspector discovered other

3
4

defects in the house that are listed in the Respondent's

5

brief.
Efforts by the Farmers Home Administration to

6

7

convince the Home Harketing Associates company to

8

correct these defects proved unsuccessful for reasons

9

that do not appear in the record.

When Respondent

10

failed to get satisfaction or to receive satisfaction

11

from the company, she filed suit in state court against

12

the Secretary of Agriculture, the head of the Farmers

13

Home Administration, various employees of the Farmers

14

Home Administration, and the United States.

15

was removed to federal court, and the district court

16

dismissed the — or, excuse me, granted the government's

17

motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a

18

claim.

19

That suit

The theory of the district court was

20

essentially that the statute and regulations created no

21

basis -- created no duty running to the Respondent to

22

guarantee the quality of the house based on the

23

inspections that had been undertaken.

24
25

The Sixth Circuit on appeal agreed with the
district court with regard to the contract theory.

It

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

found nothing in the statute, regulations, or conduct of

2

the Farmers Home Administration that would create any

3

kind of a contractual duty to warrant the quality of the

4

house.

5

The court of appeals, however, reversed under

6

the — on the tort issue, and held that the government’s

7

inspection could legitimately be regarded or could

8

potentially, at least, be regarded as having violated

9

the good Samaritan doctrine.

The good Samaritan

10

doctrine requires someone who acts on behalf of another

11

and engenders reliance from that other person to

12

exercise due care and to be responsible for any injuries

13

caused by the failure to exercise due care.

14

In addition, the court held that the

15

Respondent’s claim regarding negligent inspection was

16

not barred by the misrepresentation exception.

17

QUESTION*

Hr. Phillips, you referred two or

18

three times to the claim as one claiming a negligent

19

inspection.

20

the duty to supervise as well as to inspect, didn’t it?

21

Actually, the claim involved a breach of

HR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the problem with that is

22

that there is nothing specific in the complaint with

23

regard to exactly what they meant by supervision.

24

only supervision of the construction, Justice Rehnquist,

25

was in the inspection of the house.

QUESTION*

Well, but the complaint never vent

2

to trial, and under the federal rules you presumably are

3

entitled to adduce any number of facts in support of

4

even a generally pled allegation.

5

certainly referred to it.

7

supervision of construction.

KB. PHILLIPS*

The court of appeals

It says, failure to provide

But that is only if there is

something in the statute that would provide for
supervision in addition to the inspection --

11

QUESTION*

I realize --

12

KB. PHILLIPS*

— and there is nothing in the

13

statute to that effect, so that at issue — the only

14

thing that could potentially be alleged and be

15

consistent with the statute is the negligent

16

inspection.

17

QUESTION*

Well, you say that even the 1949 Act

18

doesn’t authorize or require the government to supervise

19

as opposed to inspect.

20

MB. PHILLIPS:

That's correct. Your Honor.

I

21

mean, the only supervision that is discussed is

22

supervised loans and the provision of information to the

23

Eespondent, so that even to the extent that supervision

24

is alleged here, it is all — it is still all based on

25

the exchange of information, and that exchange of

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

information is what this Court held in Neustadt as

barred undar the misrepresentation exception.

5

QUESTION:

Nr. Phillips, doesn't it — Excuse

QUESTION:

Sell, following up on this point,

me.

6

then, if I may, what does Section 1476(a) mean, then,

7

when it says, "Buildings and repairs constructed with

8

funds advance^ pursuant to this subchapter shall be

9

supervised and inspected as required by the Secretary?”

10

NR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, as required by the

11

Secretary.

Nothing that we have specifically requires

12

us to do more supervision of the construction.

13

supervise to the extent that we provide plans and

14

general architectural information to contractors that we

15

hope — that we expect that they will follow, and we

16

follow that up by inspecting the house to try to see

17

that there is some conformity between the plans and the

18

way the house is developed.

19

QUESTION:

We do

And it is your position that the

20

Secretary has never authorized any supervision of

21

construction ?

22

NR. PHILLIPS:

Not in the way that would be

23

anything other than by — that would be covered -- not

24

in any way that is not covered under the

25

misrepresentation exception to the Tort Claims Act.

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

And Section 1822.7, which says

2

"Supervision will be provided borrowers to the extent

3

necessary to achieve the objectives of the loan and to

4

protect the interests of the government?"

'***

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure, because that doesn't —

6

that still is supervision of the borrowers.

It is not

7

-- He don't supervise construction.

8

the government assumes a position of foreman for Home

9

Marketing Associates.

It is not as though

We go out and we inspect it.

10

That is the primary method by which we supervise.

11

is additional supervision in that we supervise the loan

12

to make sure that the moneys are spent properly, and

13

there is additional information, and the provision of

14

architectural services is a form of supervision.

15

all of that, I submit, is supervision that would be

16

barred under the misrepresentation exception if there is

17

a basis for it.

18

QUESTION:

There

But

Are you arguing that the government

19

has under the laws established here no duty to the owner

20

of the home, that the law creates no duty in this area?

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

Well, I mean, that is what the

Was that your position?
We did not argue that in this --

It would be my position, that we owe no specific duty to

this — to the Respondent in this case.

2

correct.

QUESTIONt

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's

Under the law.
Under the law.

That while we do

5

— I mean, there is no — The regulations provide

6

general obligations to act, but the only duty that would

7

ever occur would have to come out of state law, and

8

that, we say, is — and to the extent a duty would have

9

existed —

10

QUESTION;

Well, how about the federal law?

Do

11

you think that the federal law indicates that there is

12

no intention by Congress to benefit the homeowner --

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no --

— by these services?
No, I — no, that is not cur

16

submission.

We recognize, just as in Neustadt, that

17

this statute is designed to provide some benefits.

18

mean, almost all federal statutes are designed to

19

benefit individual citizens.

20

primary purpose of this statute, we have submitted, is

21

to protect the government's security interest.

22

that, we will in most instances also protect the

23

homeowner, but that is only incidental to what I submit

24

is our primary mission, at least as interpreted by the

25

Farmers Home Administration, which is a reasonable

QUESTIONS

3

MR. PHILLIPS*

4

And there is no secondary duty?
No secondary duty that would

give rise to any kind of tort liability.
QUESTION*

5

If the government is responsible or

6

assumes responsibility for anything like architectural

7

supervision, that certainly is — the thrust of that

8

sort of a liability, if they fail to perform it, isn’t

9

misrepresentation at all.

If you are an owner and hire

10

an architect, and the architect defaults on his

11

obligation to supervise, the gist of your claim against

12

him isn’t that he didn't tell you that a lot of things

13

were bad in the place, it is that he didn't have them

14

fixed.
MR. PHILLIPS*

15

We recognize that there is a

16

difference between misrepresentation and various forms

17

of malpractice.

18

didn’t hire an architect of any sort.

19

we had an architect draw up plans that would be usable

20

for all rural residents, and we have a variety of those

21

plans that exist, and we just hoped that they would be

22

followed.

23

But all we are saying here, I mean, we
What we did was,

That’s all.
QUESTION:

I thought you identified the

24

question in

the case as whether the United States has

25

waived sovereign immunity for this kind of a tort

1

action

2

MR. PHILLIPSi

3

QUESTION;

4

Yes, Your Honor.

So whether you owed a duty or not or

whether you broke it is irrelevant to that question.
MR. PHILLIPS;

5

Well, that is correct, except

6

that under this Court's decision in United States versus

7

Neustadt, the way the analysis should run is, first,

8

whether the basic activities of the government are

9

within the misrepresentation exception which we submit

10

means an inspection which may be negligently performed

11

followed by certification of some facts followed by

12

injury.

13

designed to deal with.

14

That is what the misrepresentation exception is

This Court went further and said it could well

15

be that even though this is within the misrepresentation

16

exception, there could be some -- there may have been

17

indication in the *34 Act at issue there that for some

18

reason Congress intended to supersede the

19

misrepresentation exception, and Respondents have seized

20

on differences between the

21

suggest that that secondary analysis in Neustadt is

22

satisfied in this case.

23

'34 Act and the '49 Act to

Our position is that there is nothing different

24

in the '49 Act and the

'34 Act.

It is clear that

25

Congress did not intend for the government to warrant

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the quality of the Respondent's house in this case.
As we have — I may be going over some ground,

2
3

but Section 1346 obviously provides a general waiver for

4

— of the government's sovereign immunity.

5

exception that we are concerned with here is for

6

misrepresentations.

7

of the Sixth Circuit is fundamentally inconsistent with

8

the decision of this Court in United States versus

9

Neustadt.
QUESTIONS

10

The

Our submission is that the decision

Hr. Phillips, let's assume for a

11

minute that the complaint did allege something beyond

12

misrepresentation, alleged that there was a duty on the

13

part of the agency to force the builder to fix the home

14

by some means, and the complaint alleges that.

15

that obligation of the government in your position a

16

discretionary act by the government?
MR. PHILLIPS;

17
18

21

You mean, within the meaning of

Section 2680(a)?
QUESTION:

19
20

Now, is

The government has discretion?

Yes.
HR. PHILLIPS:

Hell, I would guess — I mean,

22

it seems fairly clear -- it depends on how the

23

regulation would be stated, I guess.

24

regulation in this case that said that the government

25

must discover every defect and must make every defect

If there were a

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 2C024 (202) 554-2345

1

corrected before any moneys will be released, then it

2

would seem to me we would be hard pressed to argue that

3

that is a discretionary decision, because the regulation

4

will have essentially taken away all of our discretion.

5

But if the regulation merely suggests that we

6

should have inspections, and there is some general

7

possibility that we might withhold money depending on

8

the circumstances, then it would seem clearly to be

9

within the discretionary function exception.

10
11

QUESTION:
they require?

Well, then, what is it — what do

Is it discretionary or not?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

would clearly be discretionary.

14

regulations — I mean, I think it is important to

15

realize in this case that the Respondent has received

16

reimbursement for the heat pump and other major

17

structural defects in this house under an administrative

18

program, and the only defects we are talking about now

19

are essentially cosmetic defects.

20

Well, I think it is clear — it
There is nothing in the

It is inconceivable, and there is nothing in

21

the regulations that would provide to the contrary, that

22

Congress anticipated that we would hold up all loan

23

moneys for the correction of all potential cosmetic

24

defects in a house.

25

don't believe Respondents deny it, there is no new house

As we suggest in our brief, and I

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that I have ever known and

that anyone has known and

2

that the contractor even in this case in his testimony

3

had ever seen that doesn’t have some problems in it.

4

And it can’t be that the government will be responsible

5

to correct all of those.

6

nothing in the regs.

And that is why there is

7

So, clearly, there is some discretion.

8

would release money and expect that the contractor would

9

make good on it.
QUESTION;

10

You

Well, but Mr. Phillips, Mr.

11

Phillips, you are not suggesting there is discretion to

12

make a negligent inspection, are you?

13

ME. EHILLIPS;

14

QUESTION;

Well —

Assuming there were a duty to

15

inspect.

16

running to the borrower, but assumina there were a duty

17

to inspect, would it not be a duty to inspect with due

18

care ?

19

I understand you deny there is such duty

ME. PHILLIPS;

If there were — if this were a

20

private person who undertook — we don't — although

21

there is no development factually of what went on here,

22

we don’t deny that it is certainly possible that a

23

private inspector could be held to a duty to exercise

24

due care under the good Samaritan doctrine.

25

QUESTION;

All right, and if we accept the

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

allegations — if we accept the allegation in the

2

complaint, must we not assume — maybe it's not true —

3

that the inspection was conducted negligently?
MR. PHILLIPS*

4
5

Well, that's right, and we don't

dispute that.
QUESTION*

6

And had the inspection been

7

conducted properly, they would have discovered the

8

defect and they wouldn't have paid for the heat pump.
MR. PHILLIPS*

9

Well, but I mean, that is just

10

as true under United States versus Neustadt.

11

case —

12

QUESTION*

13

misrepresentation.

15

Well, but that goes to the issue of
We are now talking about —

MR. PHILLIPS*

14

In that

You just want to ignore the

misrepresentation --

16

QUESTION*

For this very narrow purpose.

17

MR. PHILLIPS*

I would be prepared to concede

18

for purposes of this argument that that is right.

19

would be a duty, and that would have been a violation of

20

the duty.

21

least here now with the Sixth Circuit's holding that

22

this might well violate the good Samaritan doctrine.

23

Our submission is obviously that it is also a

24

misrepresentation, and therefore —

25

There

We don't have any quarrel with the Court at

QUESTION*

Prior to 1946, would there have been

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

any action sustainable against the government, prior to

2

the Tort Claims Act?

3

MR. PHILLIPSi

4

QUESTION:

So, Your Honor.

The Tort Claims Act, did it waive
a

5

all sovereign immunity, or did it have some exceptions?
MR. PHILLIPS:

6

7

exceptions.
QUESTION:

8

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

13

that in this case.

15
16
17

That's correct. Section

2680(h).

12

14

For governmental functions,

primarily discretionary governmental functions.

10
11

It has a very lengthy set of

But again, you are not relying on

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, we don’t rely on the

discretionary functions.
QUESTION:

You are just relying on the

misrepresentation exception.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct. Your Honor.

19

Our position here is that there is no -- that

20

this Court cannot affirm the holding of the Sixth

21

Circuit without overruling its prior decision in United

22

States versus Neustait, and that it would be wholly

23

inappropriate to do that.

24

interpretation of Section 2680(h), a provision that

25

Congress enacted in 1946 and has allowed to remain in

Neustadt involved simply an

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

effect since 1961, when this Court decided Seustadt.
If its feeling was that the interpretation of

2
3

this Court was improper or unduly restricted the rights

4

of recovery of individuals in Respondent’s position, we

5

can only presume that it would have changed it.

6

Instead, what Congress has done is, one, passed

7

additional legislation providing for inspections relying

8

upon this Court’s decision in Seustadt, and more

9

fundamentally, has passed 42 USC Section 1797(c), and

10

this case —
QUESTION*

11
12

You find no difference in the two

Acts, the one involved —
SR. PHILLIPS*

13

No difference that would make

14

any kind of a difference to take the case out of the

15

misrepresentation exception.

16

anything in the 1949 Act provides any stronger basis for

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay, Your Honor.

What we can

say, I think, is that it is inconceivable that the

without having made its final inspection, and therefore

we believe it is a fair inference from all of the

circumstances to conclude that we didn't actually send

the check away until after we had engaged in the final

recognize! that the traditional common law rule of

2

misrepresentation recognized tort in the situation where

3

there is an inspection followed by certification of a

4

fact followed by injury in reliance on that fact.

5

that is precisely what is involved in this case, and a

6

misrepresentation exception should be applied in this

The

complaint alleges that the builder was disbarred

which showed that builder had nine other complaints

Secondly, that the officials failed to obtain

In the

set of plans that what they were supposed to be for Hs.

Third, that the Farmers Home did not properly

12

MR. CROCEi

I realize that.
I don’t think that is really

material, because whether or not Farmers Home performed

those services under its statutory obligation or

15

regulatory obligation or voluntarily undertook them, the

16

fact is that they did.

17

QUESTION;

The crucial —

So part of your complaint is not

18

only that there was a duty to supervise that was

19

breached, but that the duty of supervision was

20

undertaken whether required by law or not, and that on

21

the good Samaritan theory it was negligently performed.

22

MR. CROCE;

That’s correct.

The crucial thing

23

for the negligence claim is whether or not there was a

24

duty of care, and the duty of care only arises under

25

principles of common law, and in this case the principle

1
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

of common law applied is the voluntary undertaking

2

doctrine.
If Ms. Neal had been given her opportunity to

3
4

present her claim before a trier of fact, this Court and

5

the parties could have avoided some of the confusion

6

which has arisen regarding some of the facts.

7

confusion in this statement is probably inevitable in

8

light of the fact that there was no trial, finding of

9

We feel it would be inappropriate for this

Court to issue an opinion which may have important

consequences to tort law and federal housing policy on

It is important to note that the government has

other words, Congress perceived there were problems
primarily because adequate inspections weren't being
made.

However, there is nothing in the statute, nothing

in the legislative history which suggests that Congress
intended to cut off or substitute a remedy in lieu of
the one provided under the FTCA.
In essence. Congress didn't contemplate whether
or not there was the existence or non-existence of any
remedy under the Federal Torts Claim Ret.
Finally, the fear of vast financial liability

MR. PHILLIPS;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just

briefly.
The Respondent's submission goes -- details a

23

long series of problems with this house, and we don't

24

deny that there are problems with her house, but what

25

that submission does not indicate is what was the role

that the government negligently supervised.

It doesn't

Well, but if they say — the

8

allegations they could introduce in support of an

allegation of negligent supervision go much further, I

10

would think, than just negligent inspection.
MR. PHILLIPSs

11

Well, they couldn't — I mean,

12

unless you are going to assume that there is something

13

outside of the regulations, and there is no indication

that anyone acted in addition to what the regulations

provide.

QUESTION*

There is an allegation of negligent

supervision in the complaint.
QUESTION*

Is there any allegation in the

23

complaint that there was an obligation by contract or by

24

statute or by regulation to supervise?

25

MR. PHILLIPS*

No, Your Honor.

There is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

nothing in there to that effect, and the district court

2

expressly found that there is no such obligation.

3

Yes, Mr. Phillips, but is it not

4

true, there is a distinction between an obligation to

5

supervise and the authority to supervise, and is it not

6

true that the statute authorized the government to

7

supervise?

8

10

MR. PHILLIPSs

It authorized the Secretary to

provide for supervision.
QUESTION*

Right.

It says — The statute

11

specifically says, in addition to the financial

12

assessments — this is Section 506 -- the Secretary is

13

authorized to furnish various things, including

14

construction supervision, and then the regulations say.

15

supervision will be provided borrowers to the extent

16

necessary to achieve the objectives of the loan.

authorize the supervision?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure, and it is —

Now, if it is authorized, even if it

isn’t required —

1

the administrative remedy one last time and suggested

2

that it is not intended as an exclusive remedy.

3

Recognize that this case turns exclusively on what

4

Congress has intended, and Congress has made clear what

5

its understanding and intent under the Rural Home Loan

6

Program would be, that is, that the program is designed

7

to look just like the situation under the 1934 Act that

8

was at issue in Neustadt, and it was because of Neustadt

9

that Congress first enacted administrative relief for

10

the FHA, extended it to the VA, and extended it to this

11

statute.
It was Congress's understanding that that is

12

13

what the 1949 Act would lead to in terms of claims such

14

as Respondent's in this case, and since it is this

15

Court's interpretation of Congress's intent that

16

controls, and the Sixth Circuit has disregarded that

17

intent completely, we ask that its judgment be

18

reversed.
QUESTION;

19

Mr. Phillips, what is the specific

20

provision in the agreement on which the claimant relied

21

for the duty undertaken by the government? Is it the

Exhibit B to the complaint?
