ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS M. GENOVESE, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. GENOVESE;

8
9

Hr. Genovese, you may begin whenever you

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
This case involves construction of Section

10
11

4F(b) of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976 and Rule 6(e)

12

of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.

13

there are two inter-related questions:

We believe

First, whether the investigative files or

14
15

other materials of the United States Attorney General

18

also includes materials covered or encompassed by Rule

17

6(e):

18

And second, if so, what is the discretionary

19

standard to be followed by a district court in

20

determining whether to release materials covered by Rule

21

6(e) pursuant to request by a state attorney general

22

under Section 4F(b).

23

Very briefly with respect to the facts, in the

24

late 1970's the Antitrust Division of the Department of

25

Justice conducted a complex and lengthy investigation of

3

ALDERSON REPORTINQ COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

That

1

the piping and sheet metal industries in Illinois

2

investigation focused on conspiracies among competitors

3

in those industries to rig bids on public projects,

4

mostly school projects in the Chicago area.

5

After the State of Illinois had received

6

notice under Section 4F(a)

that it had a potential cause

7

of action, it made a request to the United States

8

Attorney General for all relevant investigative files or

9

other materials under Section 4F(b).

In response at

10

that time, we were provided with 19 pages of preliminary

11

memoranda generated long before the grand jury had been

12

transferred to the Northern District of Illinois.

13

Everything else, we were informed, was covered by Rule

14

6(e), and that the Government would support our request

15

for a court order releasing the materials.

16

Subsequently the State of Illinois and the

17

Chicago Board of Education filed two class action treble

18

damage lawsuits on behalf of the public entities in the

19

area seeking to recover the overcharges suffered by

20

those entities as a result of the conspiracy.

21

The criminal actions have long ago

22

terminated.

The civil cases are still proceeding with

23

discovery, and in that regard a few of the transcripts

24

in one of the cases may be disclosed to us pursuant to

25

Rule 6(e) because those transcripts were previously

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

disclosed to the Defendants.
Turning to the first question, I believe it

2
3

takes great liberties with the very broad expansive

4

language of that statute to conclude that information

5

relating to matters or occurrences before an

6

investigative grand jury is somehow not contained in a

7

prosecutor's files or other materials.

8

statute plainly includes all materials compiled by an

9

Assistant United States Attorney General to prepare and

10

prosecute his case.

11

QUESTIONi

We believe the

Suppose the Attorney General came

12

back and said, we don't have a transcript of the — what

13

happened before the grand jury any more.

14

it once, but we don’t.

15

support your request before the judge.

16

standard then when you went to the judge would be Rule

17

6(e) or would you say, the statute has made this

18

material available to us on a lesser showing?
MR. GENOVESEs

19

Maybe we had

But we’ll be glad to — to
Do you think the

Well, I think we first have to

20

address the question of whether it is part of the

21

investigative files or other materials of the Attorney

22

General.

23

QUESTIONc

Well, suppose the Attorney General

24

says, we just don’t have a transcript any more now, and

25

let’s just assume that’s correct, that’s accurate, he’s

telling the truth
MB. GESOVESEs

Okay.

Well, I believe the

3

United States Attorney General is supposed to retain

4

custody of the grand jury transcripts and documents.

5

For example, if the documents are no longer in the

6

possession --

7

8
9

QUESTION*

You mean they’re not in the

possession of the court?
MR. GENOVESE*

No, I don’t believe they’re in

10

the possession of the court.

11

of the United States Attorney General.

12

QUESTION;

They’re in the possession

Well, so you’re saying that if a

13

transcript of the testimony is in the hands of the

14

Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division or

15

the Attorney General, you're entitled to it under this

16

statute with no court proceedings at all, but if the

17

same transcript is in the possession of the court you

18

have to make some showing?

19

MR. GENOVESE;

No, Justice Rehnquist.

We

20

believe that, first of all, we look at the statute and

21

decide what the Congress intended to cover by —

22
23
24
25

QUESTION*

Do you need to be that elaborate to

answer the question?
MR. GENOVESE*

No, I just meant to go to the

next point, which is that the "extent permitted by law"

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

language raises the question of by what standard the

2

court should release the materials.

3

authorize the United States Attorney General to turn the

4

information over to a state attorney general.
QUESTION;

5

The court can

So that if the material, if the

6

transcript,

the physical transcript, is in the

7

possession of the Justice Department, the Justice

8

Department must join you in going to court even though

9

it has physical possession, is that right?

10

HR. GENOVESE;

11

QUESTION*

12

to court, do you?

4

That’s what I’d like to find out.
We do not say, we have never

said, that it is automatic disclosure upon demand.
QUESTION;

5
6

You say you don’t even need to go

MR. GENOVESE;

3

Yes, that is correct.

Well then, what sort of an inquiry

would the court make in that case?
MR. GENOVESE;

7

We believe that the court

8

should inquire, first of all, what reasons for secrecy

9

remain in the transcripts, in the documents.
QUESTION;

20

Where do you get that out of the

2

statute?

22

inquiry from the statutory language?

23
24
25

Where do you get the nature of the court’s

MR. GENOVESE;

By the language "extent

permitted by law.”
QUESTION;

And what do you think that refers

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to?
MR. GENOVESEi

2

We believe that refers to Rule

3

6(e), which indicates that a court may disclose

4

materials preliminarily to or in connection with a

5

judicial proceeding.

6

under Rule 6(e) to involve a careful assessment of the

7

needs for secrecy and the needs, to the extent they

8

remain, and the compelling interest in disclosure.
QUESTION*

9

And we understand the standard

May I ask this question.

You say

10

that the "extent permitted by law," or whatever the

11

words are, incorporates by reference Rule 6(e).

12

your view?

13

MR. GENOVESEi

14

QUESTION;

15

Yes.

And if Rule 6(e) contains a

particularized need requirement, you must meet it.
MR. GENOVESE;

16
17

Is that

We believe that the

particularized need requirement arose in cases involving

18

QUESTION;

19

Involving private parties, not

20

public.

21

don't have to satisfy particularized need but merely

22

generalized need, then why do you need the Hart-Podino

23

Act ?

24
25

If it doesn’t apply to public parties and you

MR. GENOVESEi

Well, we believe you need the

Hart — well, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act is designed to

state the Congressional purpose, to state to whom the

materials —
It tells the Attorney General what

QUESTION;

4

he has to io on your request.

5

you've got to go to the court and say, we t hink 6(e)

6

doesn't prohibit disclosure.

7

prohibit disclosure because you don’t have to show

8

particularized need.

9

to the court without even citing the statut e?

10

And you're s aying, well,

And you say i t doesn’t

So why don't you just go directly

MR. GENOVESE;

The statute is an expression of

11

Congressional intent, not only with respect to grand

12

jury materials —

13

QUESTION;

14

jury materials at this point.

15

Well, I'm just interes ted in grand

MR. GENOVESE;

That’s why we need the statute,

16

because the Congress has indicated the inte ntion, the

17

reasons why, for national antitrust enforce ment —

18

QUESTION;

Well, do you concede t hat without

19

the statute you couldn 't get these material s under 6(e)

20

without a showing of particularized need?

21

MR. GENOVESE;

22

Maybe I misspoke. Justice.

23
24

That is correct.
I'm s orry if I —

could you repeat the question?
QUESTION;

If you did not have th is statute

MR. GENOVESE

2

QUESTION:

Yes

— and you merely went before the

3

court on a 6(e) motion, would you have to show

4

particularized need?
MR. GENOVESE;

5

We believe that it is not only

6

because we are a public entity, but also because the

7

Congress with respect to this specific matter has

8

indicated an intent that the materials be turned over.
QUESTION;

9
10

question.

Well, you still haven't answered my

If there were no Hart-Rodino Act --

11

MR. GENOVESE;

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

— before the Act was passed,

13

there's an open question as to what showing a public

14

agency such as the Illinois Attorney General must make

15

under 6(e).

And I'm asking you —

16

MR. GENOVESE;

17

QUESTION;

Oh, I see.

-- if there were no Hart-Rodino

18

Act, could you get these materials just without showing

19

particularized need.
MR. GENOVESE:

20
21

to do that.

23
24
25

But that is a question that —

QUESTION:

22

I believe that we may be able

If that's true, why do you need the

sta tute ?
MR. GENOVESE;

We need the statute because the

statute quite clearly states that in this regard, with

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

respect to antitrust enforcement by the states, Congress

2

has indicated a compelling need in the balance for

3

determining —
QUESTION ;

4

Let me phrase the question

5

differently.

Do you think this statute changes the

6

showing otherwise required under Rule 6(e)?

7

MR. GENOVESE;

8

QUESTION;

9

Yes, we believe that.

Lessens it?

Makes it less of a

showing ?
MR. GENOVESE;

10

Yes, we believe that the

11

showing of need for disclosure has been demonstrated by

12

Congress, has been supplied by Congress; and you balance

13

that against what reasons remain with respect to the

14

particular materials in the file which countervailingly

15

QUESTION;

16
17

You have to do more than just make

the motion.

18

MR. GENOVESE;

19

QUESTION;

20

Pardon me?

You have to do more than just make

a motion.
MR. GENOVESE;

21

Yes.

We have to demonstrate, I

22

think, the degree of secrecy that remains or should

23

remain.

24
25

QUESTION;

Well, that’s what Justice Stevens

was trying -- just what do you have to show?

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. GENOVESE*

1

We have to show that the

2

materials are relevant to a potential cause of action of

3

the United States -- of the state attorney general, and

4

that the reasons for secrecy are no longer viable.
QUESTION*

5

Is this to save you the time, save

6

the state the time of calling its own grand jury,

7

calling in the same witnesses?
MR. GENDVESEi

8
9

That is the exact purpose of

the statute, to — Congress did more than simply confer

10

standing on state attorneys general.

It wanted to

11

facilitate a coordination, communicative effort between

12

the state and federal attorney generals with respect to

13

local and regional antitrust enforcement.

14

believed quite clearly in the legislative history that

15

that could not be done unless sufficient investigational

18

information was made available to the state attorney

17

general.

And it

The problem we have here is that whenever the

18
19

government brings a criminal antitrust action all or

20

virtually all of the information, certainly all the

21

valuable and significant information, is covered by Rule

22

6(e).

23

frustrated by reading the statute so as to require a

24

state attorney general to make the same showing of need

25

as a private litigant in private litigation cases.

And we believe that the intent of Congress is

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION;

1

On the need for secrecy inquiry of

2

the court, I suppose some of the people most concerned,

3

who might want to oppose the disclosure, would be people

4

who may have been questioned before the grand jury but

5

weren’t indicted, for example.

6

of obtaining notice, I suppose, that the disclosure was

7

even being sought, would they?
MR. GENOVESE;

8

9

they were notified.

They would have no means

Justice O'Connor, in this case

There are, I believe, probably

10

nearly a hundred Respondents in this case.

11

know who they all are.

12

outset the district court directed the United States

13

Attorney General to notify the parties involved.
QUESTION;

14
15

statute about that -MR. GENOVESE;

17

QUESTION;

19

But I understand at the very

Certainly there's nothing in the

16

18

We do not

I believe that —

— and we don't really address that

problem.
MR. GENOVESE;

There's nothing in the statute,

20

but I think the common procedure under Rule 6(e) is to,

21

at least in my experience, is to contact all interested

22

parties, which would include not only witnesses but also

23

defendants in a particular case in which the materials

24

are sought to be used.

25

We have found in this case that reading the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

statute so as not to include grand jury material is not

2

only — it not only raises the problem in the practical

3

sense of trying to separate out Rule 6(e) from non-Rule

4

6(e) in a single file of the prosecutor, but also, as we

5

have found in this case, such an interpretation excludes

6

the essence of the information in those files.

7

believe that is in direct contradiction to what Congress

8

intended when it passed the statute.

9

QUESTION;

We

Hr. Genovese, would you mind

10

addressing how you think that the particularized need

11

standard would require the state to do more than inquire

12

into relevance and the need for secrecy?

13

would that do as a practical matter in increasing the

14

state’s burden?

15

MR. GENOVESE;

What else

As a practical matter, 4F(b)

18

was designed to disclose to the Attorney General before

17

he filed a case whether he had a case and to assist him

18

in bringing the action.

19

embark on an action of this magnitude.

20
21
22

QUESTION;

It's very important before you

No existing judicial proceeding, in

other words?
MR. GENOVESE;

Right.

And so it would be very

23

difficult in almost every instance, particularly where

24

there’s been a grand jury investigation, for the state

25

attorney general to state to the court with any great

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

degree of particularity the information that he needs to

2

carry out the intent of Congress.

3

that, he would have to file suit, he would have to

4

undertake discovery first, and attempt to show a

5

particularized need two or three years later.

And as a result of

Nor do we believe that the language "upon

6
7

request" in the statute was meant to limit or define the

8

materials which are disclosable.

9

that it only states the initiation of a process of

We believe instead

10

disclosure, speaking again not only of grand jury

11

materials but of all materials in the file, which may

2

involve work product, trade secrets and so forth.
For example, in the Colonial Chevrolet case

3
4

the bill of particulars was placed under seal by the

5

district court.

6

general, the United States Attorney General could not

7

have — would not have been empowered to turn the bill

8

of particulars over.

9

bills of particulars and — but it requires a court

Upon the request of the state attorney

Yet the law permits disclosure of

ord er .
Another common situation is where in a

22

government civil enforcement action the defendants

23

insist that the record be placed under seal of court.

24

Upon the request of the state attorney general, the

25

federal attorney general lacks the power to disclose.

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

But a court order will permit that disclosure, because

MR. GENOVESE:

that the Government took, not under a subpoena but just

18

with a witness, and the Attorney General says, I just

Can he do that under the statute?

24

decide whether it permits it?

25

Well, what law do you turn to to

MR. GENOVESE:

In a situation where, for

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

example, a proffer, the Government is apparently unsure

2

whether that is covered by Rule 6(e).

3

this case the United States Attorney General has made

4

the determination that it ought to be disclosed.

5

situation where ha felt that shouldn't be the case, we

6

might be dealing with an informant's privilege or some

7

other kind of privilege, and in that situation again we

8

would have to look to see if the privilege, work

product, whatever it is, is — how that weighs against

10

the Congressional desire, intent, very strong intent

11

that these materials be made available to a state

12

attorney general so that he can pursue his own actions.

13

QUESTION i

Well, there you leave open the

14

possibility that the Attorney General and the state

15

attorney general would be almost adversaries, I suppose,

16

and the Attorney General would raise the question of

17

work product, and then what, some court would have to

18

decide that?

19

NR. GENOVESE;

It could happen that on

20

occasion the state attorney general and the United

21

States Attorney General could be adversaries with

22

respect to a particular matter.

23

25

QUESTION;

What sort of a court proceeding

would you have to resolve that?
KR. GENOVESE;

I think that in a situation

grave error as well, for one particular reason;

11

essentially concluded that a state attorney general's

12

need for the disclosure of the investigative material is

13

the same as a private litigant's need.

14

if applied to all the materials in Rule 6(e),

15

effectively means that a state attorney general is only

16

entitled to what -- the same materials he received

17

before the statute was passed and, oddly enough, to the

18

same materials which any private party could obtain.

19

It

That reasoning,

In essence, what that means is Section 4F(b)

conclusion.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. WILKINS, ESQ•*

ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

MR. WILKINSi

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courti
Section 4F(b) of the Hart-Scott-Rodino

11

Antitrust Improvement Act embodies a Congressional

12

determination that, in order to promote state-sponsored

13

litigation as a vital aspect of national antitrust

14

enforcement policy, the United States Attorney General

15

should to the full extent permitted by law disclose to

16

the states any investigative files or other materials

17

that are or may be relevant or material to a potential

18

state antitrust enforcement action.

19

Notwithstanding this evident policy, evident

20

Congressional policy of disclosure, the court below

21

declined to allow the State of Illinois access to 5500

22

pages of grand jury transcripts that are relevant to two

23

class action lawsuits filed by the state under Sections

24

4 and 5 of the Clayton Act.

25

propositions ;

It did so based on two

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

First, it doubted whether Section 4F(b)

1
2

included grand jury materials in the possession of the

3

Attorney General; and second, it concluded that the

4

statute had no impact on its balancing test under Rule

5

6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as to

6

whether it should allow those materials to be used in

7

another judicial proceeding.

8

Neither proposition, we believe, is sound.

9

Section 4F(b) by its clear terms reaches any

10

investigative files or other materials within the

11

possession of the Attorney General.

The second ground upon which the court below

based its decision is equally unsound.

Would you agree, then, that before

know whether that test would apply to private -- would

3

or not that particular test would apply to a public --

4

to a state attorney general which is seeking this

5

material as a law enforcement official for a public use

6

or to further the public interest, whether he would have

7

to meet that test without Section 4F(b), I am

8

uncertain.
QUESTION:

10

Whether

Well, if he doesn't have to meet

that test, then he doesn’t need the statute.
MR. WILKINS:

11

No, we believe, whatever the

12

standard would be appropriate without the statute, we

13

believe that Section 4F(b) is a weighty Congressional

14

policy in favor of disclosure that a court should

15

properly consider in the Rule 6(e) balance, and because

18

of that weighty consideration the compelling and

17

particularized need test is not a proper standard.
QUESTION:

18

Then you say it does amend -- you

say it does amend, it silently amends the 6(e) standard

MR. WILKINS:

No, I don't think that that's a

we said, Rule — or Section 4F(b) and failed to take it

We believe that the two provisions must be read in

7

harmony and there is a way to do so.

8
9

In passing on a state's request for grand

jury

material under Rule 6(e), a court should not utilize the

10

compelling and particularized need test because this

11

fails to give significant weight to the Congressional

12

determination that's inherent and embodied in Section

13

4F(b).

14

determination that:

15

actions are vital to the national antitrust enforcement

16

policy; and, two, full disclosure and cooperation of

17

federal investigatory files is essential to aid the

18

states in performing this function.

19

Section 4F(b) represents Congress' dual
one, state antitrust enforcement

It's important to realize that the very most

20

significant and indeed probably the only useful parts of

21

our antitrust investigatory files, our criminal

antitrust investigatory files, are included in the grand

jury materials.

QUESTION;

But is it not true that if you

MB. WILKINS;

It could be a lot of material.

Moreover/ not only does the standard fail to recognize

4

the weighty Congressional policy in favor of disclosure/

5

but as stated it was developed and applied by this Court

6

solely to requests by private parties.

8

party, but by a state law enforcement official, who

9

Congress has found to be an ideal and effective

10

A request under

Moreover, any concerns regarding possible

11
12

abuse or misuse of grand jury materials in this context

13

must be mooted, because the Attorney General himself is

14

a law enforcement official, well aware of the crucial

15

role the grand jury plays in our criminal justice

16

system.
A proper consideration of the concerns and

17
18

policies furthered by both Section 4F(b) and Rule 6(e)

19

would lead the Court to adopt the following standard.

20

At the conclusion of a criminal proceeding, a state

21

under the auspices of Section 4F(b) may normally obtain

22

antitrust grand jury materials on a showing of

23

relevancy, provided that a continued interest in grand

24

jury secrecy is not shown to prevail in the particular

25

case.

gives full credence to the interests and policies

protected by both Section 4F(b) and Rule 6(e).

standard allows the state to obtain the vast majority of

Section 4F(b) is a weighty consideration on the

Moreover, this Court has made very clear in its prior

precedents that as the need for secrecy decreases, the

justification a party must show to obtain disclosure

decreases also.

18

that some of the Defendants had possession of those

19

transcripts already.

20

I understood the state

So it seems to me that an important

21

consideration here is the fact that there is no evidence

22

in this record and there is nothing in the legislative

23

history to indicate that the particularized need test or

24

so-called particularized need test is frustrating the

25

antitrust enforcement that Congress has mandated in the

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, or that indeed the law

2

enforcement efforts of any county or state are somehow

3

being frustrated by that test.

4

All that test is is a determination of whether

5

or not there is a need for that particular transcript or

6

those particular minutes.

7

QUESTIONS

Does it require a pending lawsuit?

8

Does the state attorney general have to have filed an

9

antitrust action already in order to establish a

10
11

particularized need?
MR. NASH;

No.

Under 4F(b) there must be an

12

action brought for the state attorney general to request

13

the materials under 4F(b).

14

QUESTION*

Under 6 —

Well, the response that was given

15

this morning was that the particularized need standard

16

did require, in the cases that have applied it, a

17

pending suit, not just the application to the court

18

under Rule 6(e).

19

MR. NASH;

In 6(e), 6(e), the disclosure

20

provisions are subject to there being a current judicial

21

proceeding or preliminary to a judicial proceeding.

22

It's my understanding that later in this term or the

23

next term this Court may decide that question.

24

a court — Baggett, which will be argued, which will

25

address that exact question, how far do you have to go

There is

QUESTIONS

2

Under the Rules of Civil Procedure,

3

I don't suppose it's any superhuman feat to file a

4

law suit .

5

HE. NASHi

None.

6

If I can get back to the question, the issue

7

here is solely whether or not the attorney general is

8

entitled to grand jury minutes automatically under

9

4F(b).

10
11

The issue is not whether or not he's entitled to

grand jury minutes.
In this case the state attorney general sought

12

the entire grand jury minutes, not just the transcript

13

of witnesses who testified, but also the documents and

14

any other minutes that may have taken place before the

15

grand jury.

16

What they sought was wholesale disclosure.

The only thing that 4F(b) says is that

17

disclosure is available to the extent permitted by law.

18

And 6(e) since its promulgation by this Court and

19

Congress in 1946 has stated that that governs, 6(e).

20

And all that that test says is, tell us what you need

21

and why you need it, and we will then balance that need

22

against the reasons for secrecy.

23

In the context of the argument that was

24

presented here, it is assumed that under 4F(b) that the

25

request will not be made until after the criminal

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

proceeding and after the investigation is completed.

2

There’s nothing in 4F(b) to say that the state must wait

3

until that time.

4

So that if Your Honors believe or should

5

decide that 4F(b) somehow modifies 6(e), there's no

6

necessity in 4F(b) that the criminal proceeding have

7

been completed or that the investigation be completed.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION;

You think, then, that 4F(b) just

wasn’t intended to work any change with respect to grand
jury minutes?
MR. NASH:

Exactly.

Senator Abourezk stated

12

exactly that in answer to Senator Hruska's question, and

13

he said there very, very directly and very frankly —

14
15
16

QUESTION;

Well, what did it do?

What range

did 4F(b) have if it doesn't affect grand jury minutes?
MR. NASH;

It affects -- well, the Antitrust

17

Division manual spells out other types of information

18

which the Government has available.

19

instance, that before immunity will be granted to a

20

witness in an antitrust investigation, that there must

21

be a proffer made by that witness, that that proffer

22

must be reviewed in Washington, D.C., at the Antitrust

23

Department headquarters, and that —

There’s no evidence

to change 5(e).
In the past when the Court, when this Court or

Congress has sought to change grand jury, the

13

availability of grand jury, they have done so

specifically.

Jencks Act, it spoke generally to various materials that

were available, and then they went specifically and

they voiced strong objection to the question of

QUESTION*

Well, if you concede that Congress

20

meant to give some help to state attorneys general by

21

the provisions of 4(b) and you say that the phrase

22

"investigative files or other materials" doesn’t include

23

grand jury testimony, is there some way of telling from

24

this record just how much help that would be?

25

I mean, does the Attorney General typically

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

have files which shed all sorts of light on a particular

2

suit but aren't grand jury testimony?

3

MR. NASH;

The only ones that know what the

4

Government possesses is the Government.

According to

5

the record in this case, prior to the filing of the

6

briefs in this Court they supplied the state attorney

7

general what they describe as 19 pages.

8

the briefs by Respondents in this case, which called

9

into question first of all whether or not the Government

After filing of

10

had made available to the state all the materials they

11

might have, two or three more pages were made available

12

to the state attorney general.

There are materials which would normally be

available -- staff interviews.

that primarily the grand jury is used to investigate

antitrust offenses, they point to a comment by Assistant

17

Attorney General Kauper in 1975 that they don't use the

manual that it retains discretion to determine in some

2

cases whether some of those materials, which are clearly

3

within the definition of investigative files and other

4

materials, that they retain the discretion.
QUESTION!

5

Was that manual statement made

6

after the enactment of 4(b)?

7

MR. NASH:

8

4(b) was enacted in 1976 and

the manual was published, I believe, in August 1979.
QUESTION:

9
10

Yes.

So then you understand the

Government, the United States Government, to take the
position that saying that the Attorney General shall

12

make available to the state attorney general to the

3

extent permitted by law allows the United States

4

Attorney General some discretion, even though it's not

5

grand jury?
MR. NASH:

6

They may allow them certainly some

7

discretion, and there are areas that readily come to

8

mind — the confidential informant, this Court's

9

decision in Roviaro.

But it seems to me that they can't

20

on the one hand say, we only gave them 19 pages so

2

Congress must have meant grand jury materials, and then

22

on the other hand not identify what they didn't give

23

them, because there was no identification that, wait a

24

minute, we're withholding some stuff to the extent

25

permitted by law.

They said they gave them everything.

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

The fact is that after Respondents' brief was

2

filed, that at least two or three more pages, according

3

to the State of Illinois' reply brief, were made

4

available to them in September of this year.

5

But there's no — our system of justice is

6

based on an adversary system, and I don't think that

7

between the State of Illinois and the Government of the

8

United States you have this adversary flavor.

9

there was a question earlier, but truthfully, according

I know

10

to the manual — and I don't know who looked at that

11

beforehand amongst the State of Illinois lawyers —

12

there were some materials that the Government says in

13

the manual they retain the discretion to give or not to

14

give.

15

It seems to me that the State of Illinois

16

should pursue that before saying to this Court, you

17

should include grand jury materials in this general

18

phrase because we only got

19

19 pages.

I think that the important point to be made

20

when you get down to the nitty-gritty, as they say, is

21

there is a distinction between grand jury materials and

22

other materials.

23

uniqueness about the grand jury system and the

institution of the grand jury, and when Congress or this

was an indication that 6(e) was to be changed.

Very quickly, I think there's a

12

tremendous gap between what Congress was attempting to

accomplish when it passed Section 4F(b) and how

14

Respondents interpret the statute.

Congress wanted the
/

15

states to have valuable information prior to the

16

institution of a lawsuit, because Congress understood

17

that in order to have local and national antitrust

18

enforcement it was essential that the states, and

19

because the states lacked the resources, it was

20

essential the states have this information in order to

21

bring these kinds of cases.

22

Respondents’ interpretation I think creates a

23

kind of inverse relationship between need and

24

disclosure.

the reason for that is that it is only the significant
