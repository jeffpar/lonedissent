ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. DEVINE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
The issue presented by this case is whether

10

law enforcement officials must obtain a search warrant

11

after a controlled delivery has been made to Respondent

12

following a lawful customs search revealing marijuana

13

within the container delivered.

14

The essential facts are as follows.

On

15

February 21st, 1979, a customs agent stationed at O’Hare

International Airport inspected a shipment from

Calcutta, India, to Respondent consignee.

in diameter and eight to ten inches thick.

in it, removing from inside a substance, which he field

process and testified that the container which was

cases held that a search at customs is reasonable by the

fact that it occurs at the border.

legitimate law enforcement purpose.

purposes could be to confirm the identity of the

enterprise.

Constant observation of the package and the

recipient are not required in a controlled delivery.

3

Quite frequently during this process, there is transfer

from one agent to another, law enforcement agency to

another, by a common carrier.

continuous Government observation of the object while it

QUESTION:

It is not required and it

In this case would your analysis be

any different had it been a small suitcase?
MR. DEVINE:

I think, Your Honor, the

12

situation might be different if you had a common

13

suitcase which could not be clearly identified and which

14

would allow readily easy transfer of the contents.

15

submit, however, that when you have a container which is

16

clearly identified and there is reasonably continuous

17

surveillance by law enforcement officials, with that

18

knowledge and then a retaking after a relatively short

19

interval, that the second taking is merely a reassertion

20

of control.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

We

So in this case much depends on the

facts, then.
MR. DEVINE:

I think, Your Honor, that the

24

Court could, because of the unusual nature of the type

25

of search which can occur at customs under the law and

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

which can give law enforcement officials specific

2

knowledge of the contents of the container, could take

3

the position that once the Government finds contraband

4

in such containers and the container is identified, even

5

if it were a suitcase, were clearly identifiable, then

6

Government, if it maintained reasonably continuous

7

surveillance, could retake that container and open it up

8

because there had been that specific knowledge and there

9

had not been a legitimate expectation of privacy about

10

the contents in placing it at an international border.

11

QUESTION!

That would be true, following up in

12

Justice Blackmun's question, only so long as there were

13

probable cause to believe that whatever had been in the

14

container was still in it.

15

apartment for two days and he comes out with a

16

container, he may just be throwing it in the trash.

17

MR. DEVINE;

If it had been in the guy's

I think that the time factor,

18

Justice Rehnquist, plus the type of container are items

19

to consider.

20

Court rouli look at is one that is premised on the

21

actual knowledge at customs.

22

But I think the basic standard which the

Of course, if it were a container that could

23

easily be changed and were in the specific control of

24

Respondent for a long period of time, those are

25

considerations which the Court would have to apply to

QUESTION;

you said the keys were along with the shipment papers?

4
5

Counsel, while you’re interrupted,

HE. DEVINE;

That’s correct, Justice

Marshall.

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. DEVINE:

I don’t understand that.
At the time -- the shipment was

8

made from Calcutta, India, to Chicago via Lufthansa

9

Airlines.

10

The Lufthansa documents for the shipment

included the keys to open the container.

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. DEVINE;

13

For anybody to open it?
Presumably for customs to open

it, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. DEVINE:

I see.
Here both Chadwick and Sanders,

16

which were cases cited by the Illinois appellate court

17

in ruling on this matter, both noted that a reasonable

18

expectation of privacy relates to what is known about

19

the container.

20

that the container itself is known to the public and can

21

be seen by the public.

22

Chadwick specifically refers to the fact

Here law enforcement had seen the contents of

23

the container.

24

that certain types of containers, such as gun cases, do

25

not create a reasonable expectation of privacy because

In the Sanders decision it was noted

11

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of their nature.

2

the contents are not known, it is certainly true of a

3

situation such as this, where law enforcement has with

4

validity gone into the container in a reasonable way and

5

determined what the contents are.

6

If that is true with a gun case where

QUESTION:

Hr. Devine, can I ask you a

7

question there?

8

Rehnquist focused on is you said it would have to be at

9

least probable cause.

The question I guess that Justice

How would you frame the standard

10

of the degree of certainty that there hasn't been a

11

changing in the contents of the container?

12

got 30 minutes to deal with and that's the problem I

13

guess the appellate court had, the interval.

14
15

MR. DEVINE;

Here you've

I certainly think — pardon me,

Your Honor.

16

I certainly think in this case if one applied

17

just about any reasonable test, such as the substantial

18

likelihood test suggested by the Solicitor General —

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DEVINE:

Do you endorse that test?
I think it is a narrow but proper

21

holding in this case, Your Honor.

22

this case with tha type of container you have, with a

23

table inside it, and inside of the table, hardly easily

24

accessible,

25

that with the suspicious behavior of Respondent in going

I think if applied to

you find the contraband, and if you couple

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

to the window, looking out, making a — whether a coast

2

is clear look, and then coming out with the container,

3

coupling all those items together, plus the fact that

4

the police after seizing the container could tell

5

whether it weighed relatively the same, I think all

6

those things clearly suggest here that there is very

7

little likelihood of change.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, I understand that, but their

test, and I guess you’re willing to endorse it, is quite

10

different from merely a probable cause test.

11

higher standard, and you say on these facts you meet

12

it.

13
14

NR. DEVINE:

We think we meet that test, yes,

Your Honor.

15

16

It’s a

QUESTION:

You’re not arguing for a probable

cause standard, is what I’m really trying to find out.
MR. DEVINE:

17

Well, I would argue — I would

18

argue for more, Mr. Justice Stevens, yes.

19

suggest that where you have a situation of actual

20

knowledge by law enforcement, finding contraband —
QUESTION:

21

I would

Once you have actual knowledge, is

22

that all you need at any time after that, is probable

23

cause to believe there hasn *t been a change in the

24

contents ?

25

MR. DEVINE:

If the container is identified,

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

either because it’s distinctive, because it's marked, or

2

because a beeper, for example, might be placed in it.

3

Yes, if law enforcement at that point has nothing

4

affirmative presented to them to take away their

5

legitimate expectation that that container still has

6

contraband within, we think it can be searched without a

7

warrant.

8
9

QUESTION;

I think you responded to one

question by saying that if there had been a lapse of two

10

or three days that would make it quite a different

11

case.

12

saying that the observation of the officers, plus the

13

short lapse of time, was sufficient to give them

14

probable cause to believe that the container was in the

15

same condition and had the same contents when it came

16

out of the apartment as when it went in?

From that is it correct to assume that you are

17

Is that your argument?

18

MR. DEVINE;

I think essentially, Chief

19

Justice Burger, it would amount to that, but I would

20

phrase it in the sense, there is nothing that happened

21

that took away from their actual knowledge because of

22

the reasonably continuous surveillance, the type of

23

container, and the amount of time that was involved

24

here.

25

Having had actual knowledge, it was certainly

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

legitimate for them after this container came out, with

2

all the facts that I've described, for law enforcement

3

to seize the container and to search it without a

4

warrant.

5

QUESTION;

Well, certainly if it had been a

6

cardboard carton, for example, and a half an hour had

7

elapsed, it would be pretty easy, if it were not within

8

the officer's view, to change the contents of the

9

container, would it not?

10

MR. DEVINE;

I think the ease of ability to

11

change the contents, Justice O’Connor, is a factor to

12

consider.

13

suggest could be brought forward as an affirmative

14

statement by Defendant or Respondent to show that there

15

were reasonable factors that law enforcement people

16

could be aware of to change their understanding of what

17

might be in that container.

18

And it is one of the things that I would

However, if there were a beeper inside the

19

cardboard box that might create a different situation.

20

I think this kind of case does require an examination of

21

all the circumstances that are involved, but I think the

22

standard I suggested provides a basis for looking at

23

those various factors.

24
25

QUESTION;

Mas the container here one to which

items could have been added within the half hour or so?

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Perhaps not possible to take out all of the contents of

2

the table, but could other items have been added?

3

ME. DEVINE;

I would expect that, based on the

4

size of the container and the size of the table, it

5

might have been possible to put something in.

6

the same time, I would, looking at the type of

7

container, not expect that someone would readily use

8

that as a piece of hand luggage.

But at

9

It is obviously designed for shipping large

10

items and, based on the circumstances of this case, I

11

think it is highly remote that anything was done that

12

would have been a transfer of a large item of contraband

13

or something other than that inside that container, and

14

then have it come out and be approximately the same

15

weight it was when it went in.

16
17
18
19

QUESTION;

How much did they get out of the

table ?
MR. DEVINE;

Chicago police officer on the scene was $100,000.

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. DEVINE;

22

The street value estimate by the

How much -- what was the weight?
The weight does not show up on

any of the common law record at this stage, Your Honor.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. DEVINE;

25

QUESTION;

Has it all the same material?
Yes, hashish.
Has a drill required to get to the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

inside of the table?

2

HR. DEVINE;

It is tny understanding from the

3

record. Justice Powell, that a drill was used by the

4

customs agent, probably on the underneath side of the

5

table, to open up holes, first to determine if it was

6

hollow, and then to remove an amount of substance that

7

could be field tested.

8
9

QUESTION;

Were any drills found in

Respondent's apartment?

10

MR. DEVINE;

There is no evidence in the

11

record that anything such as a drill was found with the

12

container.

13
14

QUESTION;

Was it openable in some other way

besides a drill?

15

MR. DEVINE;

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. DEVINE;

18
19
20

21

Well —
Do you know?
We don't know from the record,

Justice White.
QUESTION:

What authority did they have to

drill into my furniture?
QUESTION;

When you're bringing it in customs,

22

they can take it apart and make a French Connection

23

search, can't they?

24
25

MR. DEVINE;

It is our understanding from

Ramsey and other cases that go back to Boyd, Justice

MR. DEVINE:

authority, Justice Marshall.

(Laughter.)

7

MR. DEVINE:

8

QUESTION:

9

Can you give me any better,

I think the case —
Customs just has that broad

authority, right, it’s your position?

10

MR. DEVINE:

There may be — certainly this

Court commented in Ramsey in a footnote that allowing

12

the customs agent to inspect in effect any baggage, any

13

person that comes across the international border --

QUESTION:

But this is drilling, this is

drilling.

16

MR. DEVINE:

Yes, and then replugging the

17

holes by the customs agent after the drilling took

18

place .
But the case is quite clear that customs can

19

20

inspect a table top or anything that comes through to

21

determine if in fact, as here, there is contraband

22

inside.
QUESTION;

23

My question is, what case or what

24

other authority do you have to drill into a piece of

furniture?

constant visual surveillance of an area searched, is not

sufficient to allow Government to go in.

That argument. Justice O’Connor,

was made by the Solicitor General and, while we

certainly believe we could withstand analysis under an

extended border search theory, Illinois is basically

11

arguing the customs exception plus the controlled

facts of this case show what they’ve called a controlled

with the Petitioner when he said this case is controlled

understanding of a controlled delivery upon the cases in

19

What I was driving at is, when you

20

use the term what do you mean by it, not what the courts

meant.

22

MR. REARDON;

I think that a controlled

delivery, if there is one, must entail a constant, close

24

surveillance and control over the contents that are to

be seized, at whatever time they are eventually seized

12

they have delivered the container into someone else’s

have demanded, they can then tell whether that container

has been opened or closed, therefore whether the

contents of that container are the same.

What problem, if any, do you have

with the fact that they also had the keys?
MR. REARDON;

Hell, at the time of the customs

search apparently the keys were attached by Lufthansa as

21

a part of the shipment and were with the tin package, so

that when it came to customs all the customs agent had

to do was to take the keys and open the package.

MR. REARDON;

Well, there's no evidence as to

was in fact locked.

was closed and opaque at the time it was delivered.

6

All that's said is the container

I suggest to the Court that, on the issue of

7

bringing the container from the customs depot to the

8

address on Goethe Street, that there are several

9

occasions when we have problems with the analysis of the

10
11

facts that has gone before.
QUESTION;

For example —

Mr. Reardon, would you want us to

12

draw a bright line where there is any period of time

13

whatsoever when the package is out of eyesight of the

14

authorities?

15

MR. REARDON;

Well, I think you're asking me

16

to go beyond the facts in this case, which I think give

17

us an opportunity to clearly see a line.

18

QUESTION;

Well, at least that would be an

19

easy approach, a bright line is drawn and it's easy to

20

be enforced that way.

21

MR. REARDON;

Well, possibly that would be the

22

way this Court could go.

23

a bright line that I don't think there's any problem

24

with drawing it.

QUESTION;

But in this case there is such

45 minutes?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. REARDON*

There's at least a half hour to

2

45 minutes where the container is not just handed to

3

someone and then that someone, as in many cases, walks

4

out of the airport with agents trailing him and

5

following him by radio.

6

at the door of his own home, an apartment but

7

nevertheless a home, a Fourth Amendment protected area.

8

9

The container is handed to him

He went inside that home with a closed
container and closed the door, and at that moment I

10

think that he manifested an expectation of privacy that

11

is protected by the Fourth Amendment.

12

interim of a half an hour, there was no evidence in this

And during an

3

case that there was any particular problem emptying out

4

that container.

5

the Petitioner on that score.

6

I take exception to the statements of

There was no information given to us that

7

there was any difficulty in opening this ordinary

8

shipping container that Lufthansa uses to ship furniture

9

and to take out the table.

There was no evidence at any

20

time as to the fact that this is a heavy object or a

21

difficult object to move.

That is not in the record.

In fact, if we are to look to the record for

22

23

anything at all, it is the statement given to us by

24

Agent Labek that he says the Respondent gave him, and

25

that is*

Now that's what Agent Labek

and then he had to fill it up again.

There’s no evidence that it was

even full at the time it was seized, other than it was,

of course, later opened.

taken — when it was searched at the police station it

And there’s no indication — and if

there was something in it, it was either put in it in

MR. REARDON:

But at the time that is relevant

MR. REARDON

Wall, first of all, if we are

talking —
QUESTION;

More likely than not is the

4

standard, is it not, more likely than not, as

5

distinguished from beyond a reasonable doubt?

6

MR. REARDON;

Well, if we are talking about

7

probable cause, obviously the standard is less than

8

reasonable doubt.

9

cases that the Illinois appellate court relied on and

But I suggest to you that under the

10

that I believe applied in this situation, both U.S. v.

11

Chadwick and Arkansas versus Sanders, the doctrine there

12

is that probable cause does not excuse the warrant

13

requirement.

14

QUESTION;

I got an impression that you’ve

15

suggested that when this man took the container out of

16

the hall and took it into the apartment, then it

17

achieved some new changed status or cloak of privacy.

18

MR. REARDON;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. REARDON;

I suggest that that —

Is that your position?
I do say that, yes.

And I say

21

that because that has been an attack made by the

22

Petitioners, that for some reason there can be no

23

objective expectation of privacy in a package, in a

24

container once it has gone through customs.

25

Petitioners feel that an objective expectation lies upon

Apparently

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

the package, rather than on the possessor or recipient,

2

and that there's some sort of halo that surrounds a

3

suitcase or container once it goes through customs, that

4

halo is erased and forever more that container can never

5

be an object of privacy again.

6

QUESTION:

Well, I think their argument is

7

that you lose the expectation of privacy so long as

8

there's some surveillance of it thereafter until the

9

point that it’s seized.

That's how I understand the

10

argument.

11

in time and the level of certainty that’s required to be

12

sure something hasn't been taken out or added.

And the tough part of this case is that break

MR. REARDON:

Well, I agree with that.

think —
QUESTION:

What level of certainty do you

think the cases show has to be applied?
MR. REARDON:

Well, Justice O'Connor, once

18

that door closes to a private Fourth Amendment area

—

19

that is why I responded as I did to Chief Justice Burger

20
21

QUESTION:

Well, do you think if the door were

22

closed for 30 seconds that that would somehow magically

23

change this case?

you're making me do things that ace not in the case, and

I take it there was hashish found in the table

Then I agree —

Then you would have no -- then you

All that would then show is that

the hasish was in there when it was delivered to him and

21

it was never taken out.

22

MR. REARDON:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

Now, on the facts of this case it

MR. REARDON:

— into the hallway with a

such certainty?

control as the cases require for them to say that this

is nothing more than a continuation of our earlier

there was an expectation of privacy that the police

been — something taken out or added in that interval?

4

MR. REARDON:

I suggest that if that would be

5

the rationale upon which the lower court or this Court

6

should rule, then that should have been developed by the

7

state as a way of showing that this container had to be

8

in the same condition that it always was.

QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn’t the question

10

be, was there an opportunity for somebody else to put in

11

the table what was later found in the table?

shouldn't that be the question if there’s going to be a

be that if we then wish to be consistent, if that is the

14

Is that relevant at all in the analysis?

15

MR. REARDON;

I think the fact that the

16

officers went to get a warrant once that apartment door

17

was closed indicates to me that those officers, as well

18

as I, knew that they had lost control at that point and

19

that they need a warrant at that point to reassert

20

control and to research that package.

Well, they hadn't lost control at

12

But don't you read our cases as

I suggest that even under Ross

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the package would be the object of the probable cause,

2

rather than the generalized interior of the vehicle, arui

3

on that basis Ross would not authorize a generalized

4

search of the car or opening of any or all packages or

5

compartments, but would rather require a seizure of the

6

package and a reduction of that package to the

7

immobility and total security of the Chadwick situation

8

and an obtaining of a warrant, as in Chadwick and as in

9

Sanders, which distinguished specifically the Carroll

10

doctrine from this type of container situation.
I suggest that, like Chadwick, when John

11
12

Andreas had a half hour with that package or more alone

13

in his home and when he came out that package was

14

seized, the same as it was in Chadwick, he stood in the

15

same relative position as the defendants in Chadwick.

16

And like in Chadwick, that package was taken to the

17

police station and reduced to total police control and

18

security.
The police had no reason to suspect that that

package contained explosives or other dangerous

21

articles.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK G. REARDON, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT - RESUMED

7

MR. REARDON:

8

In the remaining moments, I would like once

9

Thank, you.

again, if I may, to address the question of Justice

10

O’Connor's as to the time lapse, the short time lapse

11

after the closing of the door.

12

of the Petitioner's reasoning that they urge us to

13

accept relating to the expectation of privacy may help

14

us in this area, and that is, the Petitioner urges us

15

that there is no expectation of privacy.

16

I think perhaps a review

He have urged that there is and that the

17

Respondent at the point that he closed the door to his

18

apartment stood in the same position relative to an

19

expectation of privacy as Mr. Katz did in Katz versus

20

United States when he closed the door to that telephone

21

booth.

22

The Court said in that case that up until the

23

moment that Mr. Katz entered that phone booth there was

24

no expectation of privacy that he could have in that

25

booth.

But when he went in, closed the door and paid

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

his dime, the Government could not enter, and it was at

2

that moment that the Government could no longer violate

3

that expectation of privacy.

4

I suggest that John Andreas at the time he

5

took the closed opaque container from the Government

6

agents and rolled it into the closed door of his own

7

apartment, that at that moment he manifested the

8

expectation of privacy and that it wouldn't matter from

9

that moment on how long we talk about or whether there’s

10

a short time gap or a long time gap, because at that

11

moment the Government does not have control, there is no

12

longer any exception that they can claim to the

13

otherwise always supreme warrant requirement.
And on that basis I hope my answer at least

14
15

clarifies it, whether or not it is acceptable to all

16

members.

17

QUESTION;

Well, having observed him putting

18

some contraband drugs into the apartment in an

19

identifiable package and then 30 minutes later seeing

20

him take that same package out, was there reasonable

21

grounds to believe that there might be drugs in the

22

package that he carried out?

23

MR. REARDON:

I think it's possible to make an

24

argument that there's probable cause at that point in

25

fact for believing that there may be some contraband in

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

that package, based on earlier knowledge.

2

court said that that‘s a possible argument, but it

3

doesn't apply here because probable cause does not

4

excuse the warrant requirement as long as there is no

5

controlled delivery in this case.

6

standard of Chadwick and Sanders, and in this situation

7

that standard is that a warrant is required absent

8

exigent circumstances.

9

The Illinois

We go back to the

It is our position that this is not a

10

controlled delivery case, the facts do not demonstrate

11

it.

12

or how little, this purely and simply is not a

13

controlled delivery case, and in that setting the

14

Government or the State of Illinois relies on an

15

improper premise in asking us to excuse the otherwise

16

necessary warrant.

17

And so to begin to elaborate as to how much control

QUESTION;

Well, it certainly could fit the

18

definition of a controlled delivery under any view,

19

couldn’t it, until the arrival at the apartment?

20

MR. REARDONi

No.

We have alleged that there

21

are two reasons for the loss of control.

There is

22

certainly the loss of control at the door of the

23

apartment, but we have alleged an earlier reason.

24

State never did establish that on February 22nd, when

25

Agent Labek went to the customs depot, that he had any

MR. DEVINE*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I'd just like to respond to two points.

With

11

regard to the earlier so-called interval in the

13

Respondent is making is that Agent Labek was not present

14

watching the container at the time that the customs

15

agent picked up the table top and put it back in.

16

container was resealed and remained in a customs bonded

17

area, from which Agent Labek picked it up the next

18

morning.

19

He had, as we have noted,

The

20

substance from the table top.

22

standard of continuity by one individual in law

23

24

Respondent would, would in effect remove controlled

25

deliveries.

To impose the kind of

It's a totally absurd standard, I think is

the only way to really characterize it.
The second point is that Respondent refers to

3

Katz and going into the telephone booth.

4

going into the telephone booth did not bring a container

5

with him which had been inspected and which had shown

6

that the contents were contraband.
