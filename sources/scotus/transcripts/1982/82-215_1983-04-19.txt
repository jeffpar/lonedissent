QUESTION ;

3

But you don 't restrict your case to

that .
KR . SKITH ;

4

I think it would be the

5

same with respect to income taxes, and the Code suggests

8

that, you kno w, once taxes are delinquent and o wing , the

1

full panoply of statuto ry authority rests in the

8

Commission to take these steps .
Mr. Smit h, in all these bank ruptcy

10

situations, there obviously isn ' t enough money to

11

around o r we wouldn ' t be having bankru ptcy proceedings

12

filed , and isn ' t -- if the government were able to sell

13

the property , it would only recover part of the taxes.

14

The theory of these reorqaoizations, of course, is to

15

qet th e bankrupt bac k on its or his f?et t o be able t o

18

pay the creditors perhaps in full .

8

concern I have is that probably in almost every case of

a bankruptcy reorganization there are taxes owed the

government, and if the government is going to take the

9

position on all these cases that it vants its levy and

10

its money out, then probably the reorganization aspects

11

will not be able to proceed in many cases, and so I was

curious v hy

KR. SMITH:

the point -- I

essential point of Phelps is, n:> matter wh at kind of

proceeding existed under the old bankruptcy la w, Phelps

25

turns on the recognition as to wh at the effect of a levy

1U
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPAHV. INC.
""°FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 82WOOO

1

is, and I think the important thing about the effec t of

2

a levy is that for all intents and purposes, it means

3

that the government has v irtually all rights to the

4

property except a fe w narro w rights .
OUESTION i

5

All Phelps had to decide for

6

purposes of deciding whether a plenary hearing wa s

7

r equire:i or summary jurisdiction under t he o l d

8

Bankruptcy Act was that the government had reduced this

9

property possession prior to the filing of bankruptcy .

10

So that is ill tha case =an sta nd for .
MR. SMITH :

11

That is all the case could have

12

could ha ve said , but the Court v ent on and discussed

13

what the effect of a levy was, and it said basically

14

that the ll!VY therefore gave the Uni te:I St;i tes full

15

legal right to the $38,000 levied upon as against the

16

claim for the patition er receiver.

17

Now, that to us is very significant , and when

18

you take that recognition as to what the effect of a

19

levy is , and you consider it against -- in the context

20

and in the perspective of the new Bankruptcy Code

21

provisions, I think

22

Court of App eals belo w erred, because what you had

23

would like to refer the Court, if I may , to the

24

pertinent

25

be construed .

overreliance on Phelps wh en one consijers that the

14

of a secured creditor vho had taken steps to recover the

Ce r tainly that wou ld have been t he

45
4LOERSON REPORTING COMP4NY, INC.

4o40 FIRST ST., N.W .• WllSHINOTON. O.C. 20001 (202) -

context, it makes absolute good sense .
All in all , then , it is our opinion that prior

2

3

decisional lav did not establish a rule that property

4

seized by prepetitioned tax levy was never subject to

5

pos t -bankruptcy turnover .

8

that the government did not have to turn o v er seized

7

a sse ts in circumstances v here a private creditor

8

e xe r cising equivalent lien rights vould not have had to

II

do so .

10

Rather , the cases simply held

The true intent of Congress with respect to

11

the t reatment of the Internal Re venue Service as a

12

creditor under the Bankruptcy Code can best be seen by

13

t he provisions of Sec t ion 106(c)(1), vhich in vai ving

14

t he government ' s ;ov ereign immunity makes it clear that

15

any provision of the Code applicable to an entity such

16

as Section 5 4 2(a) , which specifically app l ies to

17

entities , applies to "go v ernmental units . "

18

As the !RS is by far the fede r al governmental

19

u n it most f r eQu2ntly involved in bankruptcy cases, it is

20

clear that Congress intended the IRS to be included in

21

Section 542(a) turnovers , not excluded , as the

22

government here suggests .

23

In conclusion, ve vould respectfully submit

that a statute ;hould be construed so as to achieve its

Our critical point here is that this property va s not

property of the estate .
