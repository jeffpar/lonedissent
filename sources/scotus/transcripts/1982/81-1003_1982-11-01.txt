Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, may

This case is about a Boston executive order

10

which applies to construction work on projects for which

11

the city makes the construction contract and provides

12

public revenues either from taxes that the city itself

13

raises or from funds that the city procures from the

14

Federal Government.

15

To the extent feasible, at least half the jobs

16

that the city creates on these projects must go to city

17

residents, and the issue is whether the Constitution

18

forbids giving residents this priority.

19

Let me stress that the question is not whether

20

the city may divert pre-existing private jobs from

21

nonresidents to residents.

22

allocation of publicly subsidized jobs that the city

23

itself generates with its own foresight and industry.

24
25

The only question is the

confronting urban decay and unemployment may take two

city's political energy on raising enough local tax

3

revenues to generate the needed jobs in classical public

4

works projects, like schools and roads; and secondly, it

5

may take the form of focusing political energy on

6

attracting enough federal aid to the city's coffers to

7

induce private firms in accord with the terms of

8

whatever federal grant is obtained to create needed jobs

9

in the construction of housing or other forms of urban

10
11

First, it may take the form of focusing the

renewal.
Boston has done both of these things.

And I

12

should like to begin with the second, with the

13

attraction of federal funds, since I think that is the

14

more innovative and the more controversial.

15

Urban renewal projects that are made possible

16

by efforts made by the City of Boston to attract the

17

federal aid that such projects need are just as much the

18

product of the city's collective political exertions as

19

are the schools and the streets that the city funds

20

through local taxes.

21

whose judgment is being reviewed here, said both in its

22

opinion and in the judgment of that Court, that all

23

projects covered by the executive order, in its words,

24

are "city-funded construction projects."

25

judgment at page A-17.

Indeed, the State Supreme Court,

That’s all the

CORRECTED
QUESTION;

1

Mr. Tribe, under that line of

2

reasoning, wouldn't it be possible to say that the

3

decision of the Hilton Corporation to build a new Hilton

4

on Copely Square might be thought to be the result of

5

the city’s ingenuity, too?

6

into that.

7

MR. TRIBEs

I suppose city efforts go

Hell, in this case, Justice

8

Rehnquist, the key point is that the city is a but-for

9

cause under the very terms of the regulations.

Under 42

10

U.S. Code section 5318(j), Secretary of HUD must find a

11

strong probability that the whole private development

12

would not occur but for the specific federal funds.

13

Now, if it could really be shown that in a

14

particular case a mix of public and private funds is the

15

direct result under the terms of the federal statute,

16

the direct result of a city process, a complicated

17

process of holding local hearings and then lobbying for

18

a grant, then our reasoning would apply.

19

QUESTION:

Well, what if it were strictly

20

private funds but the city had been very active in

21

persuading the persons who had the disposition to

22

private funds to use them in Boston rather than

23

Minneapolis?

24
25

MR. TRIBEs

I suppose that that would push our

logic beyond the point whare I would urge the Court to

2

the city deserves a pat on the head for having something

3

happen that the city can then parcel things out in a

4

preferential way.

5

program itself identifies a special role for cities to

6

solve problems of severe economic distress, and to do so

7

by attracting indispensable federal money, then at least

8

the jobs on that project are indistinguishable from jobs

9

that are funded by municipal bonds or by other things.

That is, we ace not suggesting that any time

We are saying that when the federal

QUESTION;

10

Well, why should the city stand any

11

better if it applies its regulation to things that it

12

had no part in funding but was federally funded, but it

13

nevertheless had a great part in producing on the scene,

14

than it should the privately funded things that it had

15

the same great part in producing?
MB. TRIBEs

16

Well, I suppose the judgments of

17

degree here are ones that this Court might well leave to

18

Congress.

19

the relevant statute, the Housing and Urban Development

20

Act, Congress specifically said that with respect to

21

these projects, not only is it indispensable that the

22

city and the developer specify that the project couldn’t

23

occur otherwise, but once the project is funded it is a

24

ceguirement under the statute that to the greatest

25

extent feasible, at least as to the job opportunities

And Congress has drawn that line; that is, in

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST 3T„ N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (2021 828-9300

1

that are made available on the project, that those go to

2

residents of the area.

3

And it seems to me when Congress has made that

4

judgment, there is no reason in the name of the Commerce

5

Clause or any other provision of the Constitution for

6

the Court to worry about remote hypothetica Is in which

7

the city might someday make a broader argument.

8
9

Here I think what is remarkable about what the
City of Boston has done is not that it is in fact

10

reserving to its citizens half the jobs on these public

11

works projects and urban renewal projects, but that

12

notwithstanding the fact that the city plays the

13

indispensable role of generating all these jobs, it is

14

willing to let nonresidents have half of them even

15

though the federal statute and the federal regulations

16

say that to the maximum extent feasible the jobs should

17

go to local residents.

18

So it seems to me as far as the federally

19

funded portion is concerned, when the city goes and gets

20

the money from the Federal Government by shewing that it

21

is needed to resolve problems of severe economic

22

distress, that at that point there is no basis for

23

drawing a constitutional distinction based on where the

24

money came from.

25

Now, I do want to suggest, though, that any

but for the innovation of the city, the whole private

5

sector might be less well off.

17

Justice O'Connor, the record is

19

believe it is, A.42 in the petition for certiorari, the

20

appendix to the petition, we know that $483 million

approximately is the total construction, at least in the

22

fairly typical year of 1980.

as those that are paid for by about $4 million of the

12

But the reason that I press the point to

13

discuss the entire urban development action grant

14

picture is that no ambiguity about the record on that

15

point could possibly justify the judgment that is being

16

reviewed in this Court.

17

QUESTION;

Did the city make the argument

18

about the federal policy that is being made now in these

19

briefs to the court below?

20

MR. TRIBE;

Well, actually, it was in the

22

city; that is, the Complaint quoted some of these

23

regulations.

25

in part, on federal regulations which seems to us fully

the federally funded portion in this case.

3

And it is for that reason that we have seen

this case as principally about city-funded in the

5

traditional limited sense, city-funded public works

6

projects, and the question whether as to those projects

Do you think your UDAG argument is

really fairly presentive of the writ for certiorari?
HR. TRIBE;

It — in the petition for

certiorari. Justice —
QUESTION;

No, the question is presented on

there on the first page.
MR. TRIBE;

No, that's right.

It was

16

certainly not mentioned in the questions presented,

17

although the questions presented are broad enough to

18

encompass it potentially; that is,

19

works employment, I would think, after this Court's

20

decision in cases like United Transportation Union v.

21

Long Island, ought not to be interpreted in a static

22

historical sense; that is,

23

the form of roads and parks and schools, they can take

24

the form in the modern period when the needs of a given

decaying urban area require an infusion of outside funds

tax-supported public

for shopping centers, and it can take that form as well.

2

And so the same fundamental issue is

3

presented, and indeed in the petition elsewhere we

4

discuss the reason that we did not think it made any

5

difference if some of the funds were federal, on page 20

6

and 21 of the petition.

7

Court need only reach the question whether public works

8

projects, however precisely defined, funded by city

9

funds, raised in a variety of ways, can be so

But it seems to me that the

11

projects are required to be Bostonians, members —

12

residents of the city — I say "members" having just

13

heard that colloquy about membership — residents of the

14

city to the extent feasible.

15

Now, when the city uses its public revenues to

16

fund traditional, classical public works — schools,

17

streets, and so on --

— public works, just pausing with

the public federally funded projects for the moment,

23

isn't there a possibility that there's a conflict

between some of the federal secretary's regulations and

25

the specific 50 percent requirement of the Boston

2

which is one of the questions that, as I understand, the

3

Massachusetts Supreme Court did not answer, and that —

— that might remain in the case?

QUESTIONS

9

I would think —

For the most part, I can see a

parallel between the two.

But isn't it possible that

10

there would be some fringe areas in which the 50 percent

11

requirement might differ from the requirement for

2

low-income persons and things of that character?
MR. TRIBE;

3

If there were a flat 50 percent

4

requirement without any feasibility test, then it

5

might.

6

documents that are there reproduced specify that if all

7

reasonable steps have been taken to comply with the 50

8

percent rule, the contractor shall be deemed in

9

compliance.

But at page 25, A.25 of the petition, the

And the Chief Justice's opinion in

20

Fullilove treated best efforts language of just that

2

kind in the federal public works provision as enough to

make it not a quota but a goal.

And indeed, in the Copely Place UDAG, urban

25

on heavily by the other side, at page 137 of the grant

do is take reasonable measures, every reasonable

possible measure, to achieve compliance.

4

5

workers are available, he is excused.

6

But if the

So it seems to me clear that if it's

7

administered in a way that is not only parallel but

8

completely convergent — and understandably, because the

9

point is the city couldn’t get these federal grants

10

without conforming its detailed reading of the 50

11

percent rule to the requirements of federal law — if

12

anything, the only colorable argument I could imagine

13

about any tension with federal law, I could imagine the

14

Department of Housing and

15

what do you mean just 50 percent; we say that to the

16

extent feasible you’ve got to target these jobs to local

17

residents.

And so it might be said that by feeling

18
19

satisfied with giving one out of every two jobs to a

20

Bostonian, the City of Boston is not doing as much as

21

federal law might require, but it’s clear plaintiffs

would not have standing to raise that issue in the Court

QUESTION:

Before you leave UDAG grants again,

2

Sr. Tribe, for a moment, what is it that the city itself

3

actually does or performs on these UDAG grants that

4

would make those programs proprietary rather than

5

governmental?

6

SR. TRIBE:

Hell, what the city has to do is

7

identify a developer and hold local hearings to make

8

sure that the developer’s precise plans will meet the

9

needs of the unemployed and underemployed and

10

particularly the minority residents of the area.

11

city having held the hearings then works out through a

12

rather elaborate system of negotiation with the ultimate

13

developer a set of rules that will comply with HUD

14

requirements, comply with respect to the kind of work

15

force that will be retained.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

The

Hell, why isn’t all that

governmental?
SR. TRIBE:

Well, it seems to me it’s

19

governmental in the same sense that when the government

20

procures something for its own police department, that’s

21

governmental.

22

that every member of this Court, as I read Reeves,

23

seemed to agree about; that is,

24

was troublesome to some members of the Court, as I

25

understood it, about creating an immunity for South

That would bring it within the very core

in Reeves v. Steak, what

the very essence of what it means to be a city? that is,

5

building public infrastructure and doing so in a way

6

that meets the city’s own needs.

7

Whereas here we are talking about

There is, I think, a confusing distinction

between proprietary and governmental which can mean

different things in different contexts.

HR. TRIBE;

And can slide by the boards.
And it slides back and forth.

And

12

that’s why we haven’t tried to rely on those labels, not

13

knowing quite what the Court has meant by them, frankly,

14

or what one ought to mean by them.

15

But we think whatever the labels might be,

16

that it’s awfully hard to think of any function with

17

respect to which the small silent voice of the Commerce

18

Clause has less to say.

performs in building streets and parks in such a way

20

that it meets its own local unemployment needs.

3

agencies by regulation, have specified that this money

4

should be targeted to residents of the city that applies.

5

What is silent here is the

But Congress by statute, and federal

To the extent that’s so,.I would imagine that

6

the thrust of the respondent’s argument is that the City

7

of Eoston was insufficiently generous to the New England

8

region by going out and getting federal grants that had

9

this condition attached.

Perhaps Boston should have

10

looked for some kind of federal grant which would

11

benefit residents of New Hampshire or Rhode Island.

12

But so far as Boston has obtained money to

13

supplement its tight fiscal situation from the Federal

14

Government, it is surely impermissible to say that the

15

silent Commerce Clause somehow overrides congressional

16

regulation.

17

If Congress were, however, to tell Boston,

18

this is money that’s available only if you use it to

19

help people in western Massachusetts and perhaps in

20

Rhode Island and Connecticut, it’d be up to Boston

21

whether to accept that money or not.

22

We’re not suggesting that this is an area so

23

governmental, so close to that National League of Cities

24

core, that Congress' spending power could not even have

25

conditions imposed.

But it does seem clear that nothing

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

CORRECTED

1

in the Commerce Clause prevents the city from using

2

these federal dollars as it was intended that they be

3

used .

4

Now, with respect to the public works projects

5

themselves, I think it is conceded all around and it

6

seems to me it would have been conceded by the Court

7

below, that if the public works jobs — the jobs

8

rebuilding streets and parks and maybe little city halls

9

— if they were filled through direct hiring by the

10

city, if the city set up a bureaucracy to do public

11

works construction, then the preference for residents as

12

employees of the city would be constitutional under the

13

decisions of this Court, such as McCarthy against

14

Philadelphia Civil Service Commission in 1976.

15

•Indeed, I think that a fair implication.

16

Justice Brennan, of your Shapiro opinion was that

17

residency requirements for welfare would be perfectly

18

acceptable; it was only the durational residency

19

requirement that was — that was a difficulty.

20

So the problem here seems to be that rather

21

than setting up an unwialiy bureaucracy to hire public

22

works groups, the city has actually created a market for

23

private firms to io some of that public works

24

construction.

25

when the hiring operates through private firms rather

And it is said by the Court below that

1

than directly, that somehow that removes whatever

2

immunity the city might have.
Frankly, I fail to understand why that should

3
4

be.

I can understand how in a case like Hickland the

5

fact that the State of Alaska tried to use its hold over

6

a scarce and important national resource like oil and

7

gas to kind of trickle out into the entire private

8

economy so that anyone who even supplied something to a

9

subcontractor who had anything to do with the ripple

10

effect of the Alaskan oil and gas was suddenly trapped

11

by the preference.

12

But nothing like that is happening here.

13

Subcontractors are included only to make sure that every

14

single job on the project is covered.

However, several points seem

One, with respect to the Boston order,

10

suburban residents in Massachusetts had no greater

11

access to the political process which produced the

12

executive order than did non-Massachusetts residents.

13

Secondly, the state statute which the mayor

14

cited as authority for -the promulagation of that

15

executive order, and which the Massachusetts Supreme

16

Judicial Court found to be unconstitutional, that

17

statute in giving the localities a preference or

allowing them to make a preference for employment in

community within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

21

something, whereas non-Massachusetts residents got

nothing.

23

So that —

contradict your earlier argument that some suburban

4

could pass a law disenabling Boston from doing something

5

like this.

6

They do have access to the state

MR. KINSSTONs

Well, my point, Justice

7

Rehnquist, is that the state statute upon which the

8

executive order was premised in itself allowed the

9

suburbs and gave them a preference with respect to

10

public construction works within their locality.

So

11

insofar if the point is that the non-Massachusetts

12

residents had representation in the process, if that was

13

the point, what I am answering is that they did not have

14

representation in the process because the other suburbs

15

were getting something in the deal, if you will.

were getting a local preference with respect to projects

I mean,

10

lots of owners sign an agreement with a contractor that

may provide that each of his subcontractors has to

MR. KINGSTON;

may not always carry.

I was wondering why you kind of resurrected the notion

Yes.

Only, Justice Rehnquist,

because we understand this Court in Hughes and in Reeves

the market participant immunity is an exception in the

first instance to the otherwise general and well

3

established rule that cities and states are not entitled

4

to throw up economic barriers in an attempt to isolate

5

themselves from problems that are shared by all.

6

3ut there's a second feature, Justice

7

Rehnquist, and that is that the order attempts to

8

preclude non-Boston residents and non-Xassachusetts

residents from work opportunity.

So to that extent as

which they do not have a right to do.
One of the further basic defects of the

executive order is that it invites retaliation.

If

Boston is able to have a resident preference scheme such

this country, one nation, as that clause, and in Tooraer

the commerce clause would protect New Jersey in the

future from efforts by one state to isolate itself in

the stream of interstate commerce from problems shared

12

the Supreme Judicial Court in this case, as its reason

13

for not finding a violation of privileges and

immunities, said that it's clear that neither on its

QUESTION;

11

In your earlier argument you seemed

12

to rest quite heavily on the proposition that Boston was

13

entitled to have these jobs to take care of its

14

unemployment.

15

every body occupying a job in one place it means that a

16

body in some other place doesn’t have that job?

But isn’t it an economic reality that for

MR. TRIBE*

17

Well, Mr.

Chief Justice, it would

18

be if we were throwing other bodies out of work.

19

the point is that the money that's being used to

generate two jobs gives one job — that money may come

So does that have some

It does have bearing on Congress* power to
