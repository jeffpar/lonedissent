CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER *

Hr. Wallace, you may

proceed when you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On cross motions for summary judgment in this
tax refund suit, the district court held the Crude Oil

10

Windfall Profits Tax Act of 1980 unconstitutional and

11

ordered refunds for taxable periods in the year 1980.

12

The district court held, contrary to our

13

contention, that the act violates the uniformity clause

14

of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, and

15

rejected our further contentions that no refund should

16

be available in any event in this suit because there was

17

no oil extracted in 1980 that was subject to the

18

exemption at issue, and our contentions regarding

19

severability of the exemption at issue.

20

court stayed its judgment, and the United States

21

appealed to this Court.

22

The district

The act at issue was the product of many

23

months, almost a year, of Congressional study and

24

deliberations involving extensive hearings, staff

25

studies, committee reports, floor debate, amendments, et

cetera
It was enacted in conjunction with the

2
3

phaseout of domestic oil price controls.

The decontrol

4

of domestic oil prices was undertaken to achieve two

5

purposes.

6

distortions that had existed because of market

7

disparities between the controlled domestic oil prices

8

and the rising world prices subject to manipulation by

9

the OPEC cartel.

One was to alleviate market disparities,

And the second purpose was to

10

encourage domestic exploration and development to make

11

the United States less dependent on imported oil.
And it was recognized widely in Congress as a

12
13

quid pro quo for the price increases that would be

14

caused by decontrol this act was required if President

15

Carter was going to go through with decontrol.

16

Actually, the phaseout was completed by President

17

Reagan.

18

reply brief a number of statements made on the floor by

19

various members of Congress explicitly recognizing that

20

this was a part of the decontrol program in the sense

21

that the windfall tax was a quid pro quo for decontrol.

22

But we have cited in note 10 of page 14 of our

Now, the structure of the act is summarized in

23

chart form in the appendix to the jursdictional

24

statement that we filed on page 3A, which is part of the

25

district court’s opinion.

The principal provisions of

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Title I of the act, which is the title that imposes the

2

tax, are set forth there in chart form.
And our contention is that except for the

3
4

first categories of exceptions, which are not at issue

5

here and which were designed for other purposes because

6

the revenues there were thought to be devoted to public

7

purposes extraneous to the overall purposes of this act,

8

the other provisions of the act, including the so-called

9

provision for exempt Alaskan oil, all fit into a unified

10

theme.

11

The act was intricately designed to tax what

12

Congress said was the subject of the tax, the windfall

13

profits that would result from the decontrol of domestic

14

oil prices.

15

identified through various mechanisms in the act in a

16

way that did not tax all of the decontrol revenues that

17

would ensue, but only those that would be over and above

18

the ones that served the purposes of decontrol,

19

including the purpose to encourage domestic exploration

20

and development of oil that might otherwise not occur.

21

But those windfall profits were to be

It was sometimes put that way in the course of

22

the legislative history, and sometimes stated as a

23

corollary, that the act was designed to impose

24

relatively high tax rates where production cannot be

25

expected to respond very much to further increases in

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

price and relatively low tax rates on oil whose

2

production is likely to be responsive to price.
In other words, the windfall that Congress was

3
4

seeking to identify was that portion of the decontrol

5

revenues that were not needed for one of the purposes of

6

decontrol, which was to stimulate domestic production.

7

And the mechanisms used included differences in the rate

8

base and these various tiers of taxable rates, all

9

intricately adjusted so as to identify what Congress was

10

getting at, what it considered to be the windfall.

And

11

as might be expected, the highest rate of tax would be

12

on the so-called old oil, the existing oil production

13

that obviously would not have been stimulated by the

14

decontrol.
The windfall was only being taxed at these

15
16

various rates.

17

And other adjustments reflect various details such as

18

the fact that heavy oil is more expensive to extract and

19

produce.

20

independent producers as against vertically integrated

21

producers because they did not have what was referred to

22

as downstream revenues and needed more in the way of

23

return to encourage their further explorations.

24
25

It wasn't being entirely eliminated.

There were special adjustments made for

These various factors were considered in great
detail and painstakingly adjusted for insofar as it was

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

practicable to do so in this rather elaborate statute.

2

And the exemption for so-called exempt Alaskan oil fits

3

into this same pattern.

4

identify those sources of oil in -- because of extreme

5

climatic and other conditions where no windfall was

6

expected to accrue at all within the meaning of what

7

Congress was getting at.
Now, this can be understood with reference to

8

10

This was carefully drawn to

a map which is appended to the brief in our support, the
amicus curiae brief of the State of Alaska.

11

QUESTION;

What color is it?

12

HR. WALLACE;

That's a green brief, Mr.

13

Justice.

15

in support of the appellees.

16

submitted on behalf of the State of Alaska.

17

foldout map at the back which indicates the scope of the

18

exempt Alaskan oil.

19

There's no difference in the color code

But it is a green brief
It has a

And this particular exemption, I might say at

20

the outset,

21

invalidity under the uniformity clause, which was, in

22

its historical origins, designed to prevent combinations

23

of states from discriminating in an oppressive way

24

against minorities of states.

25

is a rather strange subject for a holding of

What's involved here is an exemption from the

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

tax for a small percentage of oil partially located in

2

one state, but —
QUESTION;

3

Sell, Mr. Wallace, is it your

4

submission that the uniformity clause would have no

5

application if one could show that somehow there was no

6

discrimination against a minority of states?
MR. WALLACE:

7

8

That is not our submission, but

I think —
QUESTION:

9

Then why do you make the point?

MR. WALLACE;

10

Because it -- it -- it puts in

11

perspective what it is that we're dealing with here and

12

why we believe that Congress acted consistently with

13

respect to this oil production in keeping with the theme

14

of the act as a whole, rather than in a way that should

15

raise concerns under the uniformity clause.
Now, the -- the exemption specifically

16
17

excludes from the exempt coverage the oil being produced

18

in the Sadlerochit reservoir, which is pictured at the

19

very top.

20

at least of discovered reservoirs, and it is currently

21

producing more oil than is produced in any other state

22

other than Texas as a whole.

23

currently producing more oil than any other state as a

24

whole.

25

That is the largest oil reservoir in Alaska,

That one reservoir is

The exemption also excludes the Cook Inlet oil

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and other oil that's been developed down in the area

2

closer to Anchorage.

3

the beginning of the North Slope of the Alaska range and

4

Aleutian range is the dividing line for the exemption,

5

but the exemption excludes any oil within 75 miles of

6

the Trans-Atlanta pipe — the Trans-Alaska Pipeline

7

system until it reaches the Arctic Circle, and then the

8

oil is included except for the Sadlerochit reservoir.

The dotted line, which identifies

Now, the State of Alaska informs us in its

9

10

amicus brief on pages 5 and 7 that currently

11

approximately 5 percent of the oil being produced in

12

Alaska is subject to the exemption.

13

that during the latter years of the applicability of the

14

windfall profits tax, which has a phaseout provision,

15

that percentage may rise to about 10 or perhaps a little

16

more than 10 percent, although much of the expected

17

additional production would be in Outer Continental

18

Shelf wells which are not part of the State of Alaska at

19

all.

20

It is estimated

So that we're talking, since there was no

21

production there for more than a year and a half after

22

the act took effect at all, no exempt oil being

23

produced, we're talking about what can on the average

24

not be expected to be more than

25

production during the entire period of the act.

10 percent of Alaskan

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

And this, in terms of the revenue disparity

1

2

caused by the exemption, would be further discounted

3

because the Sadlerochit oil and virtually all other

4

Alaskan oil, the great bulk of the 90 percent, is

5

subject to the highest rate of the tax under the

6

statute, 70 percent, whereas the exempt oil would be

7

subject to the rate for newly discovered oil, which at

8

the time of the initial enactment was 30 percent, and in

9

a 1981 amendment is being phased down from 30 to 15

10

percent on newly discovered oil throughout the United

11

States.

12

So that we 're talking in terms of the effect

13

of the exemption in Alaska of a very small proportion of

14

the revenues that would otherwise be generated from

15

Alaska by this law.

16

QUESTION;

Nell, what's that got to do with

17

the uniformity clause?

18

argument about the severability clause.

19

MR. WALLACE;

I can see how you might have an

Well, it does bear on the

20

severability clause, but it also bears on the contention

21

being made by the appellees that this act favors Alaska

22

as a price for getting political support from Alaskan

23

representatives in Congress, and represents a coalition

24

of Alaska with others who favored the act as against the

25

states that would be more heavily taxed.

Actually,

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Alaska is one of the most heavily taxed states, and

2

every member of the Alaska delegation who voted voted

3

against the art.

4

But it bears on what is argued to be the

5

legislative background of the act and the way it — it

6

— an effort has been made to fit it into the historical

7

purposes of the uniformity clause as showing an unfair

8

coalition of states acting against the interests of

9

other states.

10

And that is —

QUESTION;

Of course, the fact is that

11

Congress used geographical terms, didn't they, when they

12

might have used other terms that were not geographical.

13

ME. WALLACE;

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. WALLACE;

That is correct.

And that's your problem.
And that — that -- we think

16

that — that what is reflected here is a finding of a

17

unique combination of risks and costs in this area due

18

to the climate, the geological factors, the -- the

19

special problems of the fragile environment caused by

20

permafrost.

21

detail in the brief amicus curiae of the State of Alaska.

22

Many -- these things are described in some

But what they show is that because of the

23

dangers of local flooding if the permafrost is disturbed

24

during the warm weather — and all of this was brought

25

out in hearings before Congress — the necessity is in

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

these areas to operate during the winter months when the

2

climate is very severe and when there is a great deal of

3

darkness, in some areas no light for many weeks at a

4

time* they're very remote from transporation, from

5

sources of labor, sources of supply, so that supply and

6

labor costs are many times what they are elsewhere in

7

the United States.

8
9

QUESTION;

The argument is made in response

that there are other areas — for instance, in some

10

offshore drilling programs in cold areas — that present

11

equally expensive problems, Hr. Wallace.

12

HR. WALLACE;

Well, no showing has been made

13

either before Congress or in the district court that

14

that is true.

15

it concluded to be unique problems in Alaska that

16

eliminated the possibility of any windfall occurring

17

there and —

18

And Congress based its judgment on what

QUESTION;

You said that they have very long

19

winters in Alaska and very short days.

20

wouldn't be true in Louisiana, would it?

21

certainly a difference.

22

HR. WALLACE;

Of course, that
That's

Well, of course it's a

23

difference.

And the -- the problems of equipment being

24

subjected to the severe weather problems, the need for

25

delays in the severe weather when no work can be done at

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62e-9300

1

all, which requires very highly paid crews to stand by

2

idly and to be housed and fed in these remote areas,

3

these -- these problems were detailed in the legislative

4

history.

5

And the exemption really was put in in

6

response to the suggestion made during the hearings by

7

the Secretary of the Treasury which reflected that the

8

exemption really served the same purposes and reflected

9

the same standards as the other mechanisms in the act

10

used to identify the-windfall profit.

11

this testimony by the Secretary of the Treasury early on

12

in the hearing process that there are no windfalls that

13

will be gained by the producers of the Alaskan crudes,

14

confining the remarks to the exempt area.

15

on to say it is easier to exempt Alaskan production from

16

the tax than to require Alaskan producers to file tax

17

returns solely for the purpose of showing that no

18

liability has been incurred, because this is an

19

expensive tax to administer.

20

And we quoted

And he went

And the exemption, in keeping with the overall

21

purposes of the tax, was meant to encourage the

22

development of these domestic oil resources.

23

brings us to -- now, so, let me — before I get to Mr.

24

Justice Blackmun's point, I just want to say that we

25

think that this, because of the findings Congress made

And this

1

about the unique circumstances in Alaska, meets the

2

established standard of this Court's cases under the

3

uniformity clauses

4

operates with the same force and effect in every place

5

where the subject of it is found, because Congress

6

isolated this area as one where windfall profits would

7

not be found.
QUESTIONS

8
9

that the tax is uniform because it

Well, the tax is actually on oil

production, isn't it?
MR. WALLACES

That is — well, it is designed

11

to tax the windfall profit.

12

called it.

13

QUESTIONS

That is what Congress

But is — what is the task on?

That is what I was asking.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — Resumed

6

MR. WALLACE:

7

and may it please the Court:
If, as I contended before lunch, the act

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

treats all persons similarly situated with regard to the

10

subject matter of the act in a similar manner, then the

11

question remains whether the fact that Congress used

12

geographic terms in describing the scope of the

13

exemption in some way adds an infirmity.
We think not.

14

We think the exemption — that

15

the uniformity clause protects substantive rights and

16

doesn't prevent Congress from using a clear and

17

convenient means of expressing itself, even though that

18

means happens to employ geographic terms.

19

co-extensive in this case with any political boundaries

20

at all.

21

They were not

And I think the point is best put —
QUESTION:

Well, they were co-extensive in the

sense that only the State of Alaska was embraced within

the exemption.

QUESTIONi

MR. WALLACE:

3

But outside the State of Alaska?
Yes.

In the Outer Continental

Shelf in the Bering Sea.
And I think the point is best made, if I may

4
5

quote a sentence used by Judge Friendly in the In re:

6

Penn Central Transportation Company case, a decision

7

that was approved by this Court in the regional

8

reorganization cases in 419 U.S., the way he put it was

9

that since what Congress did was not in violation of the

10

Constitution, we decline to hold its action to have

11

constituted a breach of the uniformity clause there of

12

the bankruptcy clause simply because it used words

13

readily intelligible to its members in the public rather

14

than circumlocutions that would have had exactly the

15

same effect.
And there has been no showing that the effect

16
17

itself, no showing either in Congress or in the Court

18

below that the effect itself is not a permissible one.
Now, in the brief time remaining I would like

19

20

to turn to the question of severability.

As in Zobel v.

21

Williams last term, this is not a case in which the

22

Court need speculate about what the Congressional intent

23

was.

24

severability is a question of statutory interpretation,

25

and the Congressional intent governs.

It is common ground here that the question of

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

The question arose not in time to be included

2

in the committee reports, but it nonetheless arose in

3

the discussion on the conference report prior to the

4

vote and was quite authoritatively addressed by the

5

floor manager of the bill and chairman of the Finance

6

Committee, Senator Long of Louisiana.

7

And what he said on the floor is;

"Mr.

8

President, it is our intention that in the event the

9

Court should find this favorable treatment for Alaska

10

dictated by the very high production costs in that area

11

should violate the conformity provision as it is there,

12

the uniformity provision in the Constitution, that

13

provision should be regarded as a nullity, and that

14

Alaska will pay the same 30 percent tax on new oil as

15

everybody else.

16

could consider it in the future."

17

If that should be too much, Congress

And then the next paragraph is the one

18

reproduced on page 11 of our reply brief where he

19

essentially repeats the same thing, emphasizing once

20

again the intention that it is the exemption that would

21

fall under the severability clause of the Internal

22

Revenue Code.

23

And these views not only were uncontradicted

24

on the floor, but they were supported by a memorandum

25

from the Office of Legislative Counsel that Senator Long

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

then had printed by unanimous consent into the record.
There is no other indication of Congressional

2

3

intent on this subject.

And since everyone seemed to be

4

satisfied by the reassurance of Senator Long, first that

5

the uniformity clause was not violated, but even if it

6

were, it would not endanger anything but the exemption

7

itself, that is the only indication of Congressional

8

intent we have and should govern.

9

a process of inductive reasoning, since this was a

10

revenue measure reported out of Ways and Keans and

11

Senate Finance and one in which the conference report

12

emphasized the amount of revenue that was expected,

13

$227.7 billion over a 12-year period, and pointed to

14

other titles of the act which involved tax credits and

15

aid to needy families and the like as -- with the clear

16

implication that these were justified by the revenue

17

intake.

18

part of this overall picture -- we're talking about less

19

than ten percent, as I explained, of the proceeds to be

20

expected from one state — and the fact that they

21

pointed to other possible means of subsidizing

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. WILLIAMS;

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and

may it please the Court;
The uniformity clause of the Constitution
requires that excise taxes be uniform throughout the

1

United States.

The crude oil windfall profit tax of

2

1980 imposes an excise tax on the production and removal

3

of crude oil, and that tax applies, according to the

4

terms of the statute, in 49 states and one-quarter of

5

Alaska.

6

attached to our brief.

It's depicted I think very clearly in the map

The tax quite clearly violates the terms of

7
8

the Constitution, and accordingly should be found in

9

invalid.
I might say that the Government in its reply

10

11

brief at page 4 suggests that Congress has taxed such

12

profits, windfall profits, in every place where it has

13

determined them to exist.

14

Honors, that the statute has a formula for the

15

computation of windfall profit— that is to say,

16

removal price minus suggested base price — and pursuant

17

to that formula, the oil in the exempt portions of

18

Alaska would be taxable.

clause has acted a restraint on regional preferences and

3

upon regional jealousies.

4

without any need for the Court to get into questions of

5

tax policy or to get into questions of legislative

6

motivation.

understandable to all, and obeyable by all, including

successful operation of this clause to suddenly abandon

It has done so entirely

government.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Williams, would you concede

13

that the Congress could exempt from taxation oil

14

produced in certain described geographical — described

15

climatic conditions, for example?

16

MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes.

I think, that Congress

17

probably could have some sort of formula which one would

18

than apply to the ground, and in areas where the

19

climatic standards were met, that formula would govern.

20

The defense -- excuse me.

21

QUESTION:

Well, is it prohibited from giving

22

a shortcut description by reference to a geographical

23

area then?

24
25

MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes.

First, let me say that

despite the references to cold climate, there's no

21

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

serious contention that this exactly parallels a cold

2

climate, any definition of cold climate.

3

The point is male by the government and

4

stressed by the Atlantic Richfield amicus brief that one

5

is talking of some combination of factors which result

6

in high production costs.

7

seem to be near Judge Friendly's observation that

8

Congress should be forced into circumlocutions.

9

But the -- and so that we

But the concern of the act as developed in

10

Congress and as developed in this litigation for cost is

11

simply in order to ensure that there are the approriate

12

and necessary incentives for the production of oil.

13

Now, for those purposes, cost in the abstract

14

is not of interest to someone interested in investing in

15

the production of oil.

16

in relation to the product, let's say how many barrels

17

of oil for cost.

18

What he is interested in is cost

When you look, at it in that light. Your Honor,

19

the Court, it turns out that in fact the production in

20

Alaska is much less costly than in the lower 48 states.

21

In fact, the ratio is approximately 20 to 1.

22

say, the return in terms of barrels of oil produced per

23

dollar of drilling costs in Alaska is less than 6

24

percent of the return per dollar invested in drilling in

25

the lower 48.

That is to

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

If one is thinking seriously about using some

1

2

kind of geographic line as a shorthand for high

3

production costs, that factor would — would point

4

towards exempting the lower 48 and not exempting Alaska.
Let me say further that there are perfectly

5

6

good ways to deal with high production costs, let's say

7

to address the question of high production costs as such.
QUESTION;

9

Well,

what do you suppose -- what

do you suppose this exemption -- why did it even come

10

into being, or do you know, or do you care?

11

it certainly couldn't be because Alaska outlobbied all

the rest of the country.

MR. WILLIAMS:

Yes, we would, Your Honor, but

have mentioned, even if the rational basis test

15

suggested by the Government were applicable, what you’re

16

looking at is a — is a trial which would be very

17

difficult and which it would be very difficult to

18

justify the line actually drawn by Congress.

19

QUESTION*

Well, would you say the exemption

20

would be invalid if they exempted all oil produced above

21

the Arctic Circle, and it turned out that the only oil

22

produced was offshore on the Continental Shelf?

23

MR. WILLIAMS:

Well, the two — insofar as

they drew the geographic line and insofar as any part of

any state was covered by that line, it seems to me it

clearly violates the requirement of the uniformity

clause.
Now, on the question of production, the

3
4

suggestion of the Government that the validity of this

5

clause should flicker on and off like a lightbulb in

6

accordance with whether or not there is actual

7

production seems to us most unsound.

8

about a statute which from its inception collected tax

9

revenue from oil producers in the lower 48 states and

You are talking

10

which drew an express legal line between their tax

11

liability and those in Alaska.
QUESTION;

12

Is there any place below — and you

13

call them the lower 48 states -- where for long periods

14

of time annually large numbers of workers are unable to

15

work and yet have to be paid?

16

MR. WILLIAMS;

17

QUESTION;

18

No, Your Honor.

We -- we —

Well, that is a difference, isn't

it?
MR. WILLIAMS;

19

We acknowledge that the

20

operating conditions are extremely hostile in Alaska, so

21

that the costs are high, but the costs per barrel are

22

low.

23

Congress framed its purposes in this statute, that is

24

the relevant kind of cost.

25

And in terms -- in the very terms in which

Let me say a word about — in the first place,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Congress in this very act addressed the problem of high

production costs in the net income limitation.

3

areas where that limitation applies one must simply —

Second, the Government relies on language in

15
16

the Head Money Cases and in Nicol v. Ames, suggesting

17

that presence of reasonable grounds is enough to justify

a tax.

19

reference essentially is attributable to the fact that

20

before 1900 this Court suggested that the uniformity

21

clause had two dimensions;

22

geographic uniformity; second, a requirement of

23

intrinsic uniformity, which meant that any

24

classification of a tax by Congress was subject to

25

review under the uniformity clause.

But the language in those cases making that

one, requirement of

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

connection that the Court in those two cases made that

2

explanation by way of justification of the tax.
In 1900 in Kelvin v. Ames it completely

3
4

removed the concept of intrinsic uniformity from the

5

tax, and after 1900 you do not see that language

6

appearing in uniformity clause cases under the tax power.
Finally, the case of Downes v. Bidwell

7

8

involved a tax, special tax on Puerto Rico clearly

9

different from taxes imposed in the continental United

10

States.

The Court said unless Puerto Rico can be

11

treated as different because it is not a territory of

12

the United States, this tax will have to be struck down.

13

I want to stress, Your Honor, that this clause

14

has operated successfully, without inquiries in a tax

15

policy and without scrutiny of legislative purpose, for

16

200 years.
Let me turn, if I may, to the question of

17
18
19

remedy.
QUESTIONt

Before you do that, Hr. Williams,

20

may I ask one question about your theory?

In some of

21

the briefs they suggest there might be a distinction

22

between physical geography and political geography.

23

Would you make the same argument if — would you take

24

the position that you could never comply with the

25

uniformity clause if you described an exempt area by

boundaries?

3

Essentially so.

One can

imagine some deminimis exception, but — but this is not

deminimis.

6

QUESTION;

Well, but — but you would say, for

7

example, all coal mined above 5,000 or something would

be equally subject to —

MR. WILLIAMS*

That wouldn’t seem to me a

10

meets and bounds description.

11

QUESTION*

12

MR. WILLIAMS*

13
14

Well, I understand that —
A meets and bounds description

in this act draws a geographic line —
QUESTION*

Well, I understand.

But if you

15

view it without meets and bounds, what if you did it by

16

altitude then, say, another geographic way, another

17

physical geographic boundary?

18
19

MR. WILLIAMS*

I don’t think there would be

any problem with that, Your Honor.

20

That would be permissible.

MR. WILLIAMS*

MR. WILLIAMS*

MR. WILLIAMS*

I believe so, Your Honor.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

would be all right.

QUESTION:

4

MR. WILLIAMS;

On the question of remedy, Your

5

Honor, there are three central vices in the Government’s

6

proposal that this tax be extended to Alaska.
It'd be wrong for this Court to impose a tax

7

8

on investors with respect to investment that —

9

investments that Congress deliberately decided to

10

exempt.

11

would be retroactive.

12

It would be especially wrong where such a tax

It would be wrong for this Court to impose a

13

tax which jeopardizes production, which might jeopardize

14

production in an area where Congress was particularly

15

concerned that production not be jeopardized.

16

And finally, it would be wrong to violate the

17

precept laid down by Justice Brandeis in the Iowa-Des

18

Moines National Bank case, discussed at pages 35 and 36

19

of our brief, in which he said that the victim of an

20

illegal — illegally discriminatory tax should not be

21

reduced to asking that that tax — the taxes of other

22

parties be increased.

23

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Williams, do those

24

observations suggest that we shouldn’t in this case, if

25

we were to agree with you on the substantive law issue,

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

follow the practice that we generally have of trying to

2

figure out what Congress would have intended had —

3

HR. WILLIAMS;

No, Your Honor.

No.

We — we

4

-- we agree with the Government that the basic test is

5

congressional intent, but we believe that the concept in

6

the — in discerning congressional intent, one has to be

7

wary of judicial imposition of taxes that Congress did

8

not decide to impose.

9

If there were an expressed provision in the

10

statute that in the event of unconstitutionality of the

11

Alaska provision, the remedy should be to tax Alaska,

12

that would control

that Congress didn't intend to impose any worse than

judicial relief from taxes elsewhere that Congress did

intend to impose?

17

HR. WILLIAMS;

Yes, Your Honor.

The

18

imposition of a tax, taking of property from a person is

19

something which, according to the Constitution, should

20

not happen without an act of Congress.

21

it seems to us, should be very strongly in the first

22

instance upon the -- anyone seeking extension of the tax

23

to show that indeed Congress made such a decision.

24
25

And the burden,

Now, here the indirect evidence -- one may
call it that -- as to congressional willingness to tax

showing that Congress did not intend to tax Alaska, the

6

Committee bill had a broader exception, one for newly

that exemption was changed as a result of extremely

9

heavy negotiations, as a result of which the newly

12

That was a package transaction, Your Honor.

13

It would seem to us extremely inappropriate to take

14

one-half of the package, the tax on Alaska oil, and —

15

I'm sorry -- to discard the exemption for Alaskan oil

16

and to retain the tax on newly discovered oil.

17

Now, this great alliance by the government in

18

terms of direct evidence on Senator Long's statements in

19

the Senate on March 26th,

20

those is that they occurred nearly two weeks a^ter the

21

House had finally approved the conference report.

22

us say all action by the House on this bill was complete

23

at the time that Senator Long made his statement.

24

Therefore, it seems to me inconceivable that the House

25

action could be said in any way to reflect Senator

1980, the first point about

Moreover, the Utah Power and Light dictum

22

occurs in 1932.

In 1946 this Court in the Township of

providing a remedy for illegal discrimination which

limited the taxpayer to seeking extension of the tax to

3

others was not providing an adequate remedy, and that,

4

therefore, federal jurisdiction was available.
There is also reliance by the Government on

5

6

the general separability clause of the Internal Revenue

7

Code, Section 7852(a).

8

from the Government’s point of view, is that the invalid

that, failing to tax similar production in Alaska.

There is nothing invalid,

I may say that the very naturalness of that

16

reading is evident to us in Judge White’s concurring

opinion in the Minneapolis Star case where finding the

19

naturally that the tax was therefore illegal.

20

In addition, the — it seems to us that

21

Section 7852(a) must be construed in the light of the

22

law then prevailing and now prevailing — that is to

say, the decision in Iowa-Des Moines National Bank, and

24

that is to say, treating the problem of remedying an

remedial problem
In the absence of any indication that Congress

3

in the — in adopting Section 7852(a) was a iming at

4

overruling the established law on that poin t, it would

5

seem to me the natural conclusion is that i t had no

6

intention at all to undercut the then preva iling rule on

7

the matter.

8
9

The only -- I may say that the only lower
court interpretation of Section 7852(a) that deals with

10

the problem — that interprets the clause in the context

11

of a tax that illegally discriminates is the Moritz case

12

from the Tenth Circuit, and there the Court construed it

13

in the way that we have suggested here; that is to say,

14

to extend relief to the taxpayer who had been

15

discriminated against rather than burdening taxpayers

16

who had been illegally benefitted.

17

I may say that the -- if I may return to Utah

18

Power and Light, the Government argues that that is a

19

case which can be completely disregarded -- I'm sorry --

20

which is not at all in conflict with Iowa-Des Moines

this continual on and off possibility, which has no

precedent in your ripeness jurisprudence.

6

And, finally, the cases which have overcome

effect, which, of course — and ours has taken effect in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

Rebuttal

2

NR. WALLACE:

3

Professor Williams has spent much of his time

Yes, Nr. Chief Justice.

4

on the question of severability, but our principal

5

contention in this case is that there is no violation of

6

the uniformity clause.

7

in the Appellees' brief, they concede that Congress

8

could have achieved precisely the result it achieved

9

here if it had used different language in drafting the

10
11

And as I understand his argument

exemption provision at issue.
That means to us that no one is being

12

subjected to taxation that Congress is prohibited by the

13

Constitution from imposing, or in other words that the

14

uniformity — the protection afforded by the uniformity

15

clause, which is substantive protection, is not being

16

violated here.

17

There have been references to the cost per

18

barrel of producing oil in Alaska.

Of course, the oil

19

being produced costs less per barrel to produce in

20

Alaska than oil elsewhere because you have to add on

21

such enormous transportation costs.

22

being developed, particularly in these remote regions,

23

are the ones where you can efficiently produce it

24

because you're getting a wellhead price of $8 to $10

25

less than the wellhead price that you can get

elsewhere.

And that has a great deal to do with why

2

Congress concluded that the Sadlerochit Reservoir should

3

be taxed and taxed at the highest rate.
The exemption was designed to nurture

4
5

production elsewhere.

And Footnote 26 on page 19 of our

6

brief shows how a slight decline in the price of oil

7

during 1982 was shown to have resulted in a slowdown of

8

development in the Kuparuk River field precisely because

9

of this problem.
One of the things that distinguishes the

10

11

exempt area from the rest of the United States is the

12

extreme remoteness from refineries and markets that

13

results in very substantial transportation costs.

14

below the Arctic Circle the exempt area excludes

15

anything within 75 miles of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline

16

system.

18

that no windfall would result in terms of what they were

trying to reach.
