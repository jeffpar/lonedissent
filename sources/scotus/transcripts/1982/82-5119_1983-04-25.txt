ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. ALLMAN, fiSQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ALLMANs

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
It is my position here in the interpretation

10
11

of the federal bank robbery statute, section 2113(b)

12

does not cover the crime of false pretenses.

13

the facts indicated in the brief, a client managed to

14

take some money from Dade Federal Savings and Loan by

15

and with their consent with an artificial trick.

16

is, he altered a check which was sort of obvious had

17

they looked at it and took $10,000 from this account

18

which he created in his own name.

19

to him.

20

bank.
Basically what we have --

22

2UESTI0N;

The check was drawn

Mr. Allman, Daytona wasn't the

drawee of the check either, was it?
MR. ALLMAN:

24
25

That

It was done totally by mistake on behalf of the

21

23

Here, as

Loan.

No, Dade Federal Savings and

It was a check which he somehow came into

possesion of, altered the deposit number on the back,

2

i.e., put his account number after scratching out

3

somebody else’s and put it in an account that he created

4

at Dade Federal Savings and Loan.

5

7

QUESTION;

The check wasn't drawn on Dade

Federal Savings and Loan?
MF. ALLMAN;

No,

it was not.

It was drawn

8

through somebody else for deposit to some account of the

9

person whose check it was.

10
11

Basically, he got the bank

involved through the bank's mistake.
It is my position in reading the statute and

12

it has created an ambiguity.

It has got the Courts of

13

Appeal — I think it is five to four now — construing

14

this statute both narrowly and broadly.

15

robbery statute which in 1934 was specifically limited

16

to bank robbery amended in 1937 to include the terms

17

"burglary and larceny", and in 1937 interpreted and

18

argued by the government that, in fact, this covered

19

only common law larceny.

The bank

20

So the position now — The former Fifth

21

Circuit now the Eleventh first went along with my

22

arguments in my brief then en banc reversed itself and

23

took the broad position that 2113(b) covered the crime

24

of false pretense.

25

is the way this Congress drew the statute.

The reason all this has come about

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

The statute was drawn as follows;

It

2

indicated that you take and carry away, steal, or

3

purloin, words that are not necessarily defined

4

specifically at common law but are in fact defined now

5

generically.

6

common law sense.

7

But in 1934, 1937 were contemplated in the

What has happened is this.

In 1934 a broad

8

bank robbery statute in dual form was submitted to the

9

House Judiciary Committee.

The Committee considered

10

this bill and specifically, specifically rejected the

11

aspects of the bill that covered crimes of false

12

pretense, embezzlement and other crimes by trick or

13

consensual takings and restricted it to the forceful

14

robbery concept.

15

of the bill and the thrust of the situation in 1934 with

16

the gangster-style bank robberies going on.

17

Thus, the title of the Act, the text

Subsequently, apparently in breifly reading

18

the Act the prosecutors have brought prosecutions of

19

people who take money from banks in various types of

20

ways, false checks, forgeries, false pretenses, trick,

21

deceipt, fraud, et cetra.

22

along with this.

23

Four districts have gone

Four districts have not.

However, the Supreme Court itself in Jerome in

24

1943 took the position and the government took the

25

position that the Bank Robbery Act, 2213(b) was a common

law situation defining the crimes it intended to

2

proscribe as robbery, burglary,

3

the Act eventually uses the terms "steal, purloin, take

4

and carry away," which are not specific to those crimes.

5

and larceny even though

In Turley, the Supreme Court gave us some

6

indications how we should interpret these nonspecific

7

common law terms.

8

look to the legislative history of the Act.

9

case specifically in Le Master the Ninth Circuit looked

What they have said is this.

10

at the legislative history in great detail and quoted

11

directly from it saying they could not do better than

the analysis which they put forth of the legislative

history which showed specifically the Act was originally

4

intended to be broad.

5

robbery in 193h and then extended to burglary and common

6

law larceny only in

7

It was tightened and limited to

1937.

For this reason the factual situation that Mr.

8

Bell put himself in unwittingly exempted him from

9

prosecution under 2113(b).

In the dissent in the

20

Eleventh Circuit the judge said it is not a question

2

that Mr. Bell has committed some kind of a crime.

22

However, the crime he committed is not

23

contemplated in 2113(b) because the legislative history

24

combined with the title to the Act combined with the

25

fact that the Act contemplated a, shall we say, active

or violent taking away from, robbery, burglary, seme

2

kind of active, moving type of crime as opposed to the

3

act of crime of false pretenses.

4

stealthily done.

That is something

It is our position if you follow Turley and

5
6

the appellate courts that look at Turley carefully and

7

analyze the guidelines in Turley and apply them to the

8

act in this case including the context of the Act, that

9

is robbery, violent acts, taking away, carrying away,

10

that type of thing with the fact that they were

11

specifically in the bill in the House investigation of

12

what they should do about the robbery situations

13

occurring in the *30s took and eliminated the crime of

14

false pretenses from the purview of this Act.

conclusion and I think the only conclusion that is

16

reasonable if you take the Act and interpret the

17

ambiguities in it in accordance with what has happened,

legislative history to win your case?
NR. ALLMAN:

21

Yes, I do. Judge, and I think in

histories of 2113(b) even though Turley was a -QUESTION;

MR. ALLMAN:

3

QUESTION:

Steal and purloin, yes, sir.
Because there was a carrying away

4

of money with soma kind of an intent to — At least the

5

person knew he was not entitled to the money.
MR. ALLMAN:

6

There is no guestion about that,

7

Judge.

8

involving the generic term.

9

else's property.

10
11

He committed a crime probably a state crime

QUESTION:

MR. ALLMAN:

13

QUESTION:

15

He took somebody

But Jerome at least used words that

had some common law meaning like larceny —

12

14

He stole.

Larceny --- and things like that, but steal

or purloin does not have that kind of meaning.
MR. ALLMAN:

It is a generic term.

That is

16

correct, and that creates the ambiguity in this sense.

17

If you look at the history of the law, if they intended

18

to cover that type of crime they would not have

19

eliminated specifically the crime of false pretenses as

20

they did in the legislative debates that created the

21

robbery statute.

22

They wanted to leave the states with that type

23

of crime specifically focusing the federal law on the

24

crime involving robbery, active carrying away, the

25

violent gangster-type crime that initiated this

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

situation.

That is my analysis of that ambiguity

2

situation. Judge.
In Turley where they were interpreting the

3
4

dire act of the interstate transportation of stolen

5

motor vehicles that type of thing, stolen was construed

6

consistently with the legislative history to be a broad

7

thing where the federal government had an interest in

8

controlling interstate transportation of stolen

9

vehicles.

In this case it is the exact opposite.
The Congress specifically eliminated the crime

10

11

of false pretenses in its debate before creating the

12

statute.

13

Master, the Ninth Circuit decision which is inconsistent

14

with the other four decisions in applying Turley to the

15

word "stolen” in the context of the statute along with

16

the legislative history.

17

you can come to reasonably if you look at Le Master and

18

go along with Turley is that 2113(b) was a restrictive

19

statute and the government used to argue in 1937 that in

20

fact it was a restrictive statute.

21

That is analyzed very well, I think, in Le

QUESTION:

The only conclusion I think

Are there any other statutes that

22

would make it a crime to get money from a bank other

23

than by this violent kind of crime?

24

MR. ALLMAN:

Yes, there are, Judge.

I think

every state in the Union has a generic term which they -■

I mean any other federal law, any

federal law.
NR. ALLMAN:

Yes, as a matter of fact, a

4

recent case, Williams.

5

think it was 1025, indicates that, and this Court held

6

recently, I think it was 1982 that unless the Congress

7

specifically says in so many words that this is the

8

proscribed act, we will not expand the congressional

9

intent to cover a generic-type situation.

10

The Williams case construing, I

In analyzing the legislative history in

11

Williams, this is exactly what they did.

12

was seeking to place a broad concept on the word's use

13

in the statute where Congress in its legislative history

14

did not intend to say --

15

QUESTION:

The government

I will put it another way.

Does

16

this Act go as far as any Act towards covering false

17

pretenses kinds of crime, or are there some other

18

statutes that might reach false pretenses?

MR. ALLMAN:

There are other statutes both

Okay.
Or does this come as close as any?
I believe this comes about as

There are other statutes that cover, for

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

instance, the carl sharping statute which specifically

2

contemplated false pretenses by specific language which

3

I cite in my brief.

4

this time.

I can't recall the case name at

However, in that case the Congress

5

6

specifically said card sharping and false pretenses is a

7

federal crime on the high seas -- It was gambling off

8

the shore of New Jersey or someing like that —

9

specifically enumerated by Congress.

This is the

10

reverse.

In this case Congress specifically

11

contemplated a broad bank robbery statute in the House

12

bill and rejected it.
QUESTION:

13

Well, do some of the cases on

14

either side of this issue -- Do some of them relate to

15

say giving a bank false information in an application

16

for a loan and getting money from —
MR. ALLMAN:

17
18

decided in 1982.

20

That was

That is the one —

QUESTION:

19

That is Williams.

Well, couldn't this defendant

perhaps have been charged under that section 1014?
MR. ALLMAN:

21

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

22

Reading that as a false statement report to get money to

23

lend.

24

you money by false statement or some other

25

misrepresentation.

I guess that is probably inducing a bank to lend

That is the way I read Section 18

QUESTION:

Have the liabilities been settled

14

as between the Dade Federal Savings and whatever bank

15

the check was drawn upon in this case?

16

MR. ALLMAN:

I am not certain about that, but

17

I am certain that Dade Federal guaranteed his

18

endorsement and, therefore, they ultimately would have

19

paid for their mistake, I’m sure.

20

It is an interesting footnote that the money

21

this man got by this means was taken from him in a

22

burglary apparently.

23

(Laughter)

24

QUESTION:

25

That is immaterial, I guess.

In 1014 Congress has protected the

bank against false statements in loan applications?

MR. ALLMAN

2

QUESTION!

Yes, sir
So it really has not left to the

3

states in all circumstances the false pretenses crimes,

4

all of them?
MR. ALLMAN;

5

6

I would agree with that 100

percent, yes, sir.
QUESTION!

7

Well, here is just another arguably

8

did not leave the false pretenses kind of crime involved

9

in this case.
MR. ALLMAN!

10

I would have no problem with that

11

in resolving the ambiguity in saying stolen or purloined

12

if the legislative history had not specifically

13

eliminated the crime of false pretenses.

14

in Jerome if you look at the Le Master case, the House

15

Judiciary Committee had a very broad bill.

16

accepted one provision and eliminated two others.

In Le Master,

They

Specifically section 2 said it should be a

17

crime for anybody to trick a bank in any way shape or

19

form, false pretenses or whatever and accomplish the

taking of money from said bank.

different.

That is why I think it is

I think it would be a good result had they
left it in, but they did not.

scratched out the prior limited endorsement, and they

guaranteed his endorsement.

That is exactly

The bank chose to ignore the fact that he

But that is not a crime under 2113(b) and that

is the whole problem here.

not.

Is there not an aspect of the

legislative history that you have not addressed at least

with the consent of the bank that the artifice and trick

line which appeared.

5

6

one might infer, I am not sure this is right, that the

it covers both categories you do not need the artifice

In the *34 bill they broke it into two parts,

take care of it.

Anyway, you see what I mean.

MR. ALLMAN;

11

Eut in the '37 bill there is no

You could argue that, Judge, but

12

when Congress has done something specifically and not

13

later taken corrective action as they have done in other

14

cases —
QUESTION:

15

They did take out the words

16

"without the consent of the bank," which was also in the

17

•34 bill.

18
19

20

MR. ALLMAN;

The bill which was not enacted

into law —
QUESTION;

Correct.

That bill said without

21

the consent of the bank was one of the two alternatives,

22

but that language is not in the '37 Act.

23

MR. ALLMAN:

That is correct.

If you look at

24

the '37 Act, the Attorney General said, look, we have

25

got a robbery statute but if there is nobody around and

Therefore, we should change the Act as

follows:

make it burglary, you do not have to put

6

anybody into fear to take the money, and larceny, common

law larceny.

8

the definition is common law larceny —

At that time the government argued, yes,

QUESTION:

9

If they wanted just to cover that

10

situation, should they not have said takes and carries

11

away without the consent of the bank because in that

12

situation there would have been no consent —

MR. ALLMAN:

that.

21

That is correct.
--the one that they are talking
Somebody came in and found the

Takes and carries away, steals,

That is an inaccurate common law larceny
It is a little broader than

I agree with you.
QUESTION:

You are suggesting the statute

22

should be read as if it included the words "without the

23

consent of the bank?"

24

MR. ALLMAN:

25

If we are going to separate the

part — False pretenses gets us to the fact that they

1

tricked him.

The bank gave consent to take it, yes.

With the larceny situation, and I think as the

2
3

statute reads and as Congress intended it contemplated

4

an active, violent, robbery, burglary concept, coming in

5

and taking something, not coming in talking to the

6

teller, putting a check in, going back, waiting the

7

20-day period and then withdrawing the money at their

8

leisure taking a chance that the bank would not detect

9

this .
This is not common law larceny.

10
11

pretenses.

12

and said the statute does not cover it.

This is false

Le Master specifically addressed this issue

This is the way I feel and this

4

Once Congress removed the force and violence

5

limitation and expanded the statute to reach nonviolent

6

theft as well as fraudulent theft, it cannot be logical

7

to ascribe to the 1937 Congress the same intent as the

8

1934 Congress.

9

conclusion is that in expanding the statute the intent

Bather the more logical and sensible

10

of the 1937 Congress was to give broad protection to

11

banks whose assets were insured by the Federal Deposit

12

Insurance Corporation.

3

Sow the choice of words that Congress used, I

4

believe, is very important.

5

heavily on the fact that Congress selected the words

6

"take and carry away" and the title larceny as if those

7

two formulations are code words for all of the ancient

8

distinctions of common law larceny.

9

The Petitioner relies very

By 1937, however, the words "take and carry

20

away" as well as the term "larceny" no longer were

21

limited soley to describing common law larcency.

22

fact, in the 1934 bill which passed the Senate it used

23

the words "take and carry away" to go on and define

takings without consent which would have been common law

larceny and then taking and carrying away with consent

which at ancient common law would have been a false

2

pretenses.

3

As this Court has noted in the Turley

4

decision, by 1919 the law of many states had developed

5

to include not only common law larceny but larceny by

6

trick, and false pretenses in their prohibition of

7

generic larceny and theft offenses.

8

fact, in the Jerome case twice used the label larceny

9

for a description of crimes including false pretenses

This Court, in

10

and pointed out that Congress did so in the legislative

11

history to the 1934 Act.

12

Thus, by 1937 to conclude mechanically and

13

dogmatically that larceny means solely common law

14

larceny and that takes and carries away means the same

15

thing that it meant in the 18th century is to ignore the

16

contemporary use of those words both common use and use

17

as words of art.

QUESTION:

Mr. Giuliani, speaking of the

19

Jerome case, in Jerome the Court held the burglary

20

prohibition of section 2113(a) did not cover this act

21

and the underlying act in Jerome was, I think, uttering

22

a forged check.

23

have brought that action under subsection (b) then?

24
25

Under your theory, could the government

No, Your Honor, because

actually it was an incomplete crime.

The Jerome case does contain dicta —

MR. GIULIANO:

That is contrary to your position.
That is contrary to the

6

position that the government is now arguing.

At the

7

same time the Prince case contains dicta that supports

8

precisely what the government is arguing.
The Jerome case really involves in our view a

9
10

very different issue.

It involved a question of whether

11

in determining whether Congress meant to cover in the

12

burglary section a situation where a person enters a

13

bank with intent to commit a felony.

14

Did Congress mean by felony, felony under the

15

laws of all the states in which case what it would have

16

read into the federal statute all the differing

17

interpretations and definitions of felony, high

18

misdemeanors and misdemeanors that vary in the h8 states

19

or not.

20

It came to the conclusion actually which is

21

supportive of our position that you should not read

22

felony to mean what felony meant at common law and that

23

you should give it an interpretation consistent with the

24

purpose of the 1937 amendment which is precisely the --

HE. GIULIANO:

5

Yes, I believe so.

QUESTION;

Could the government in the case

6

that we had last term in Williams have prosecuted for

7

the check kiting scheme under this subsection?

8
9

MR. GIULIANO:

If the scheme had actually been

completed in the sense that check kiting you have the

10

ambiguity as to whether or not the person intends to

11

make good on the check in the period of time between the

12

time that they write the check and the time that the

13

check is actually finally negotiated.

14

person goes through with the check kiting scheme and

15

takes away the money then you really move out of the

16

strict definition of check kiting and you have an actual

17

theft of the money.

18

If, in fact, the

interpretation of the language of either the statute or

interpretation of it.

development of this law.
