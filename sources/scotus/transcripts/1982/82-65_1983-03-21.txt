2

QUESTION;

I should have said tried to.

3

MS. DAVIDSON;

4

One thing that is important for you to

Yes, Your Honor.

5

understand is that all parties stipulated that the

6

overall relative range mas 99 percent in the 64 plan and

7

that the ratio mas 3.25 to one, while the 63 plan had an

8

overall relative range of 66 percent and a ratio of 2.09

9

to one.

10

The three-judge panel, of course, found that

11

the 64 plan, the vote dilution suffered oy the

12

appellants below, was de minimis and even if it ware or

13

were not, as the case may be, that there were rational

14

state policies which would justify the discrepancy.

15
16

QUESTION;

Could I — could I ask you, did you

attack the alternative --

17

MS. QAVIDSCN;

18

QUESTION;

No.

The 63 plan?
Did you say that the

19

conference committee or the bill says if this provision

20

for this county is stricken, then it would be combined

21

with another county?

22

MS. DAVIDSON;

23

QUESTION;

24

MS. DAVIDSON;

25

QUESTION;

Yes, that is correct.

Did you attack that part of it?
No, we did not, Mr. Justice.

13

QUESTION:

And that woulc be between what?

14

MS. DAVIDSON:

That would be the difference

15

between the most over-represented county and the most

16

That is, that the maintenance of the integrity of

There are other factual incidences, though,

The state of Wyoming, in this case, hangs

that differ entiate this case from the Mahan case.

The

10

first factor which is necessary to consider is that the

11

Virginia General Assembly had bean authorized by

12

constitution not only to act general laui, but to act

13

specific or local law in regard to the government,

14

organization and powers of cities, counties and towns.

That sort of authority is specifically prohibited by our

No such authority is given

Lastly, the Virginia plan produced the most

22

effort to produce the minimal deviations possible.

2

minimal deviation and that, would give Wyoming a two or

3

MS. DAVIDSON;

4

Yes, that is true.

If we went

5

back and used the smallest county as the most basic unit

6

-- it would be an incremental unit — in determining

7

membership of the house, it would well exceed three

8

hundred members.
QUESTION;

9

Ms. Davidson, what practical harm

10

do your various clients in the more populous counties of

11

Wyoming suffer as a result of giving Niobrara a

12

reoresentative rather than half a representative.
MS. DAVIDSON:

13

That's a very good question.

If I may I would ask the Court to consider these

QUESTION:

39 percent is consistent with them?

2

MR. COX:

3

The reason that I contend that is because this

Yes, Your Honor.

4

Court has looked at that percentage deviation figure as

5

an indicator, and a very important indicator, uihich

6

shows just how close a state is coming to numerical

7

eauality in its apportionment decisions.

8

has not invested that statistic with any particular

9

significance, except in saying that if a plan deviates

10

by lass than ten percent it is presumptively valid and

11

there can't be threat.

12

threat to majority control, if you have got less than

13

ten percent is it's statistically highly improbable to

14

have a minority dominating the legislature, if you've

15

got less than ten percent deviation.

16

3ut the Court

The reason there can't be a

If you have more than ten percent deviation, I

17

suggest that we use the other standards that this Court

18

has used in the past, and look at other statistical

19

measures to see whether that indicator that says there's

20

deviation between districts indicates some kind of

21

fundamental impact, invidious impact upon the exercise

22

fundamental right.

23

This Court talked in Reynolds v.oims and its

24

companion cases, the one man, one vote rule means that

25

the majority has to control the legislature.

That if a

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

small minority such as 25 percent in Alabama or IS

2

percent in Maryland has a strangle hold on the

3

legislature then other persons, the substantive rights

4

of the majority are threatened.

5

In this case» substantive rights of majority

6

in Wyoming or the Plaintiff's in particular or the

7

counties that they represent, are not threatened if sue

8

refer to those other statistical measures.

9

The reasons for tnat are that the number of

10

representativas in the Wyoming house substantially

11

exceeds the number of representative districts, a

12

measure emphasized by this Court in Reynolds v. Sims.

13

Further, the legislature is responsive to the

14

majority evan if uie take, deliberately, a sample of the

15

legislative districts in the state and take those that

16

are most ovamapresented, me still find 47 percent of

17

the — not less than 47 percent can elect the majority.

18

It takes at least 47 percent to elect the majority of

19

reoresentatives.

20

QUESTION;

Mr. Cox, is it basically your

21

position that the state policy of having at least one

22

representative from each county would justify any

23

deviation no matter how large?

24

MR. COX;

25

take that postion.

No, Justice O'Connor, we would not

Clearly Reynolds teaches us that although

political subdivisions may be a factor that deserve

consideration in apportionment* carried too far there

4

could be a submergence of equal participation.

5

7

QUESTION;

What is too far, if 39 percent

isn't too far?
MR. COX;

I don't think that that statistic

8

alone tells us the ansuier to that question.

I think we

9

have to look at several of these statistics because each

10

just measures* and sometimes in an exaggerated fashion,

11

a particular part of the statistical picture.

QUESTION;

And would you be making the same

argument if there were five counties like Niobrara?
MR. COX;
