Mr. Ganzfried, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT Or JERRQLD J. GANZFRIED, ESC.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. WASSERSTROM;

Thank you.

7

Justice and may it please the Court;

Mr. Chief

8

This case presents an important question under

9

the federal Food» Drug and Cosmetic Act that will have a

10

profound effect on the public health.

11

Appeals' decision permits the sale without FDA approval

12

of a large category of prescription medicines known as

13

generic drugs.

14

interchangeable with preexisting or pioneer drugs for

15

treating serious and life-threatening diseases» but they

16

are not identical to the pioneers and they may in fact

17

be unsafe and ineffective.

18

The Court of

Such products purport to be

By way of background, I should explain that

19

drugs are composed active ingredients» which are

20

intended to have a therapeutic effect on the patient,

21

and inactive ingredients, which are not intended to have

22

a therapeutic effect.

23

however, play an important role.

24

to 99 percent of a product and they often have a

25

significant impact on how the active ingredient does its

The inactive ingredients,
They may comprise 90

For example* the inactive ingredients

3

influence houj much active ingredient reaches the

4

bloodstream and how quickly this occurs.

5

drugs have the same active ingreaient» we cannot assume

6

that they mill have the same results.

7

ingredients may slow domn or block the action of the

8

active ingredient altogether, so it's as if the patient

9

took no medication at all.

So even if two

The inactive

For a patient mho's taking a

10

drug to control high blood pressure, such as most of the

11

drugs involved in this case mere, this means he runs the

12

risk of heart attach or stroke.
On the other hand, the inactive ingredients

13
14

can speed up or increase the effect of the active

15

ingredient, and this is perhaps most apparent in time

16

release drugs, inhere the result can be a dumping of

17

active ingredients too quickly into the bloodstream,

18

causing toxicity, overdose and other adverse side

19

effects.

two or three or ten times the appropriate dosage.

It's as if in that case the patient has taken

By the same token, different manufacturing

21

22

methods can also affect horn the drug works.

If the drug

23

is packed too densely or too loosely into the tablet,

24

the patient may suffer from wholly unintended

25

reactions.

These differences are vitally important for

generic drugs.

for preexisting products u/hose effects and proper

dosages are well known.

performs the same way the pioneer does,

6

may be dangerous.

7

These drugs are offered as substitutes

But unless the generic actually
the substitution

Because the generic company does not know the

8

full composition or manufacturing methods of the

9

pioneer, the only way to be assured that the copy and

10

the pioneer will in fact work the same way is by testing

11

one against the other.

12

way, they are considered to be bioequivalent and

13

14

do not work the same way, then substitution poses a real

15

dan ger.

If they perform in a similar

But if they

16

In this case, the district court found that

17

the products Respondent sold were not tested and were

18

not generally recognized by experts as safe and

19

effective for their intended uses, and that was all the

20

Government needed to show for Respondents to be

21

enjoined.

22

3ut the Eleventh Circuit held that these

23

untested drugs could be sold with no scrutiny

24

whatsoever.

25

use of the term "drug" refers only to active ingredients

Tha court wrongly concluded that the Act's

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and not to the real life drugs that doctors prescribe.

2

pharmacists dispense, and patients ingest, that is drugs

3

as products.
As a result, the court has discarded the

4
5

carefully crafted statutory scheme that assures that all

6

drugs available for consumption by the public are in

7

advance determined by experts to be safe and effective.

8

And this holding creates a mammoth exception that mould

9

allow untested prescription drugs to reach the public

10

simply because a manufacturer wants to sell them.
QUESTION;

11

May I ask two questions.

First,

12

you don't adopt the position of the district court, do

13

you?
MR. GANZFRIED:

14
15

needed to show?

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. GANZFRIED;

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. GANZFRIED;

20

As to uihat the Government

Yes.
No.

They mere wrong, too?
That's correct.

The district

court tried to adopt a middle ground.
QUESTION;

21

Your position is, even if there's

22

no evidence of dangerousness, that the statute still

23

applies?

24

MR. GANZFRIED;

25

QUESTION;

In essence, that's right.

And also, your position, if you

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

read the statute literally» mould apply to over the

2

counter drugs» too?

3

MR. GANZFRIED:

Our position mould apply to

4

over the counter drugs» and the FDA treats over the

5

counter drugs in a manner that's consistent with the

6

statute.

7

QUESTION:

Well» but it doesn't require a new

8

drug application every time you put a different coating

9

on a piece of aspirin.
MR. GANZFRIED:

10

Well» two things as to over

11

the counter drugs.

First of all» none of the drugs

12

involved in this case are over the counter drugs.

13

Second, what the FDA has done in the over the

14

counter drug monograph system is to determine practical

15

working definitions in advance of general recognition.
QUESTION:

16
17

literally.

18

enforce it?

19

They just don't read the statute

They just say they don't really have to

MR. GANZFRIED:

They read it literally, but

20

they understand that in looking at what an expert mould

21

need as the requisite evidence of safety for an over the

22

counter drug, which, keep in mind, is not as potent, not

23

as toxic, and has a much wider range in which it can be

24

used effectively before you reach overdose situations.

25

QUESTION:

Well, some of them can be pretty

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

dangerous, I think, over the counter drugs? can't thay?
MR., GANZFRIED:

2

They can be, and in fact the

3

FDA does have regulations relating to inactive

4

ingredients of certain over the counter drugs.

5

important thing is that in both cases, the prescription

6

and over the counter drugs, the FDA locks at products,

7

and it is the product that must meet the standards, not

8

simply the active ingredient.

9

QUESTION:

The

Mr. Ganzfried, isn't what the FDA

10

does with over the counter drugs, though, someuihat

11

similar to the test that the district court mould have

12

employed, inhere it said if there is no reasonable

13

possibility that the differences between the excipients

14

will make the product less safe and effective than the

15

recognized product, it u/ould be approved?

16

MR. GANZFRIED:

17

QUESTIONS

18

Well, I think they —

As a practical matter, is that what

the FDA —
MR. GANZFRIED:

19

I'm trying to think that

20

through.

It's possible that the results may be the

21

same, but I think what has happened is very different.

22

First of all, we are dealing in this case with

23

prescription drugs.

24

apply the wrong standard, it did find that the

25

Government had shown that there was a reasonable

And although the district court did

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

likelihood that Respondent's drugs were unsafe and

2

ineffective» and that they presented no evidence to

3

reout that.
QUESTION:

4

Right.

3ut I take it both the

5

Government and the Respondents do not support the

6

district court test for the prescription drugs?
MR. GANZFRIED:

7
8

My

understanding is that the Respondents do not, either.
QUESTION:

9
10

The Government does not.

What is the definitional line

between prescription drugs and over the counter drugs?
MR. GANZFRIED:

11

The definitional line is that

12

if the finding is made by the Food and Drug

13

Administration that a particular drug product has

14

sufficient risks or side effects attendant to it that it

15

cannot be sold without a doctor's prescription and under

16

a doctor's care, those drugs require prescriptions.

17

drug products that are ordinarily used for minor and

18

self-limiting illnesses, where there is a very broad

19

range in which a product can be used effectively before

20

you reach any dangerous levels —
QUESTION:

21

22

25

Do you mean aspirin and bufferin

and so forth?
MR. GANZFRIED:

23
24

For

Those are over the counter

drugs.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing I decided I'm going

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to go ahead and manufacture something called "Uff9rin,"

2

which is just like aspirin only it's buffered a little

3

bit differently than bufferin is.

4

can tell whether I have to apply for a new drug

5

application?

Is there some way I

/

MR. GANZFRIED:

6

Well, if it complies with an

7

over the counter drug monograph — and I'm assuming in

8

that case that you're describing some kind of an

9

analgesic — you would have to check the over the

10

counter drug monograph which defines in advance what the

11

general expert recognition would be, tells you what

12

active products must be in it, what suitable inactive

13

products must be in it, and what dosages are allowable.

14

And if you satisfy that standard, then it could be

15

marketed as an over the counter drug.
Now, my understanding is that at the present

16
17

time the analgesic monograph has not yet been

18

completed.

19

overall over the counter drug review system.
QUESTION;

20
21

3ut that is in the works as part of the

Does the statute draw a distinction

between over the counter drugs and prescription drugs?
MR. GANZFRIED;

22

In the definition of drug it

23

does not.

In other provisions of the statute it does,

24

where it imposes certain restrictions on drugs that can

25

be sold only by prescription.

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

On some drugs that can be purchased

2

aver the counter there is a printed disclaimer or

3

warning, "Not to be used except under the direction of a

4

physician."

5

manufacturer is being ultracautious» or is that

6

required?

Now, is that just a case where the

MR. GANZFRIEO:

7

Well, I don't knouj about the

8

specific case, but ordinarily in the over the counter

9

drug situation the understanding is that information can

10

be provided to the patient that mill be understood by a

11

layman.

12

insert that you've described along with an over the

13

counter drug, then presumably it either conforms to what

14

the monograph describes as what the packet insert should

15

be for the over the counter drug or it —
QUESTION:

16
17

So that if you do have the sort of package

3ut that warning is not something

that is required by the FDA, is that right?
MR. GANZFRIED:

18

Some warnings are, and some a

19

manufacturer would add, I assume as a matter of prudence

20

in particular cases.
I'd like to explain why the decision below

21

22

should be reversed, by touching on the statutory

23

language and the legislative history, and then turning

24

to the strong public policy arguments that also mandate

25

reve rsal.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The Court of Appeals went astray from the very

1
2

first step of its analysis by ignoring crucial portions

3

of the definition of the word "drug."

4

has a four-part definition.

5

part, you have a drug.

Section 321(g)(1)

If you satisfy any one

Now let me draw your attention to subsection

6
7

(S), which defines a drug as "an article intended for

8

use in th.e diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or

9

prevention of disease."
QUESTION:

10

Counsel, Respondents say that the

11

word "article" as used in the definition is a word of

12

art and refers only to items that are the subject of

13

monographs, and would you deal with that in your

14

discussion?
MR. GANZFRIED:

15

In a word, it's nonsense.

As

16

this Court said in Bacto-Unidisk, the statute is to be

17

read as broadly as its literal language indicates and

18

not narrowly to accord with any particular medical or

19

scientific definition.

20

Court has read the statute, that argument is not

21

correct.
QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

So in terms of the way this

And what about the legislative

history?
MR. GANZFRIED:

In terms of the legislative

history and the use of the word "article" in these

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

formularies "that ara the reference ooint, the

2

formularies in fact have monographs of drug products,

3

dosage forms, and finished Droducts.

4

not correct.

So the argument is

5

It mould also not make any sense --

6

QUESTION:

7

the different subsections, in your view?
MR. GANZFRIEO:

8
9

Does it mean something different in

No, it doesn't.

In any of the

subsections, an "article" can refer to an active

10

ingredient, but never to an active ingredient alone.

11

can refer to active ingredient and the final drug

12

product.
QUESTIONS

13

In your viem who has the burden of

14

proof in determining whether a drug product is a new

15

drug?
MR. GANZFRI5D:

16

As these cases have come

17

along, the Government has assumed the burden, in an

18

injunction action such as this, of proving that a drug

19

is not generally recognized by experts as safe and

20

effective.
QUESTION:

21

22

Are you willing to adhere to that

position ?

23

MR. GANZFRIED:

24

QUESTION:

25

It

Excuse me?

Are you willing to adhere to that

position, or should the burden be on the manufacturer?

1

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I think there ara good

MS. GANZFRIED

1
2

arguments as to tuhy the burden should be on the

3

manufacturer» because the statute puts it on the

4

manufacturer in the first instance by requiring him to

5

get the NOA.

6

the Food and Drug Administration has sought to meet that

7

burden in the cases.

8

different from this Court.
QUESTION:

9
10

3ut as a matter of history and practice»

We're not asking anything

I take it the Administration has

not been consistent over the years in its position?
MR. GANZFRIED:

11

Well» the fact of the matter

12

is that the Food and Drug Administration has been

13

consistent on the critical issue that's involved in this

14

case, and that is whether the FDA has regarded the words

15

"drug" and "new drug" as referring to products.

16

the very first regulations that the FDA issued under the

17

statute in 1S38, it said that differences in inactive

18

ingredients may cause a drug to be a new drug, and that

19

regulation has remained substantially unchanged to the

20

present.

21

22
23
24
25

From

Respondents point to certain practices, some
of which are no longer in effect —
QUESTION:

But for 30 yeahs it issued these

"no new drug" letters.
MR. GANZFRIED:

"Not new drug" letters, that's

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

correct
QUESTION;

2

3

And you think that's consistent

uiith —

4

MR. GANZFRIEDJ

It stopped in 1968.

5

It is consistent in the sense that, first of

6

all, it provided notice to the FDA that a drug was

7

proposed to be marketed, and such notice is not going to

8

take place under the Court of Appeals' decision.
Second, it was clear that the FDA, even in

9
10

issuing these advisory opinions, was looking at products

11

because on occasion it rejected the sale of so-called

12

generic products that mere copies of the active

13

ingredients of products already on the market.
And third, that practice, u/hich as I said was

14
15

terminated in 1968 when all the "not new drug" letters

16

were revoked, was in place at a time when the burgeoning

17

generic drug industry was significantly smaller than it

18

is today.

19

anti-substitution laws, so that if a brand name drug was

20

prescribed it had to be dispensed.

21

substitute a generic.

22

Through the 1960's most of the states had

You could not

Around the end of the 1960's and into the

23

1970's, the states had shifted their position, in large

24

part because the 1962 amendments to the Act that we're

25

concerned with here called for effectiveness to be

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

demonstrated before a drug could be sold.

2

reliance on that» in reliance on the fact that the Food

3

and Drug Administration was going to be reviewing in

4

advance products that were going to be on the market,

5

the states have moved to the current regime of drug

6

substitution where generics can be substituted when the

7

brand name has been indicated but the doctor allows

8

substitution.

And in

And that points up one of the major problems

9
10

in this case.

Unless the generics are subject to FOA

11

scrutiny, the doctor is not going to know what product

12

his patient is actually getting.

13

how the inactive ingredients may differ, he's not going

14

to know how the manufacturing methods may differ.

15

patient may end up with results that are altogether

16

different from what the doctor intended.

17

the doctor doesn't what drug —
QUESTION:

18

He's not going to know

And because

Well, if he doesn't know why

19

shouldn't he write his prescription for the pioneer

20

drug?
MR. GANZFRISO;

21

The

The fact of the matter is, he

22

will.

And that was what the testimony in this case was,

23

that doctors, as they had experience with generic drugs

24

that simply failed to do what they purported to do and

25

found that when they shifted their patients back to the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

brand name drugs that tha situations uiara remedied —

2

and that is exactly ahat is going to happen.

3

generic drug industry is going, and the demand for

4

generic drugs is, as the amicus briefs indicate, going

5

to evaporate if there can be no assurance for doctors,

6

pharmacists and patients that they're actually getting

7

tha drugs that they think they're getting.

The

8

The other difficulty is that the doctor may

9

never know that there was a problem with the drug, in

10

the case of a progressive disease —
QUESTION:

11

Well, isn't it up to him to know?

12

He certainly assumes that risk with a prescription

13

drug.

14
15
16
17

MR. GANZFRI5D:

He should know, but he often

will not know.
QUESTION:

Well, he can prescribe and on the

prescription write "no substitution."

18

MR. GANZFRIED:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GANZFRIED:

He can do that.

And they often do.
And they often do, and they

21

ar9 doing it more and more as the problems with generic

22

drugs are becoming more apparent.

23

QUESTION:

What is left of the exemption

24

provision if your view prevails?

Certainly when the

25

statute was written it appeared as though Congress

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

•thought that certain articles that mould be drugs» u/hich

2

uisre widely accepted in the field as being equivalent»

3

would not require the NDA's.

4

kind of an exemption would just disappear,

5

not?

6

MR. GANZFRIEQ;

And under your view that

No, it wouldn't.

would it

It wouldn't

7

for the reasons that this Court described in Hynson.

8

drug would come on the market, to take one example,

9

subject to an approved NDA, new drug application.

A

At

10

some point after there has been significant experience

11

with that drug and enough published in the literature so

12

QUESTION;

But it takes what, 13 years to

reach that stage?
HR. GANZFRI5D;

No*

no, no.

I think the 13

4

years figure that you use is something that Respondents

5

argue as the time it takes from the first concoction of

6

a drug in the laboratory up through the time that you

7

get approval from the Food and Orug Administration.

8

That's not the time period that would be involved for

9

generic drugs, because the FDA has implemented

10

procedures to expedite and simplify the process of

11

getting approval.

12

In fact, there have been recent regulations by

13

the FDA in the Federal Register of October 11th, and the

14

Food and Drug Administration is making great progress

15

towards simplifying the process so that it will be a

16

much quicker one.

17

those regulations is that it may take approximately two

18

years for an application to be approved from the time it

19

is submitted and filed with the FDA to the time that it

20

is approved.

21

would continue thereafter.

As I recall, the evidence in terms of

But the active regulation as a new drug

22

Now, the portion of the statutory definition

23

of the word "drug” that I referred to, subsection-(S),

24

is something that the Court of Appeals ignored

25

altogether, and its finding that only the active

ingredients are covered finds no support in the

2

statutory language.
The Court of Appeals' error is even clearer

3
4

when viewed in the full context of the Act.

5

passed this Act in 1933 in the u»ake of the Elixir

6

Sulfanilamide tragedy, in which more than IOC people

7

were killed by an unsafe inactive ingredient in a drug

8

that had the same active ingredient as another product

9

that had been used safely for years.

10

Congress

The Act was passed

to ensure that such incidents never be repeated.
The Congress went about this task with great

11
12

care.

13

discussed in some detail already.

14

drugs would be subject to expert scrutiny before they

15

could be sold.

16

is the NDA process.

17

It established a statutory scheme that we've
Under this scheme all

And the cornerstone of this legislation

Now, I should add that in the statute Congress

18

specifically identified the information that was to be

19

supplied in an NDA, and that included, in addition to

20

evidence of testing to establish a drug's safety, all

21

the ingredients in the drug must be listed and the

22

precise methods of manufacture supplied.

23

that from the very start Congress expressed its concern

24

for inactive ingredients and manufacturing methods, as

25

well it should have after the Elixir Sulfanilamide

So it's clear

1

situation
Now, Congress amended the Act in 1962

2
3

following the Thalidomide tragedy in Europe.

4

time it expressed its approval of FDA's efforts in

5

keeping Thalidomide off the market» and it expanded the

6

Act's protection of the public by adding the standard of

7

drug effectiveness» so that nou a manufacturer must

8

demonstrate by substantial evidence that its product is

9

both safe and effective for its intended use before it

At that

10

can be sold.

And there was no indication in 1962» or

11

1938 for that matter, of any Congressional intent to

12

weaken FOA's power to keep unapproved drugs off the

13

market.
Aside from the preclearance program, the Act

14
15

also provides other means for ensuring that drugs, once

16

on the market, perform as they are supposed to.

17

these misbranding and adulteration provisions are

18

important enforcement tools* they address only products

19

already being sold and are not a substitute for

20

premarket review, nor were they intended to be such a

21

substitute, as again the Elixir Sulfanilamide history

22

shows.

While

23

That drug was in fact seized as misbranded,

24

but the experience led Congress to conclude that such

25

after the fact remedies alone were not enough.

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Now* in totally exempting the generic drugs

2

from the NDA process the Court of Appeals said that they

3

may be sold even though they're not tested* as was the

4

case with the drugs in this case.

Among these is the requirement I mentioned

And under the

10

of adverse reactions under Section 355(j).

11

circumstances warrant* the agency may withdraw its

12

approval and in that event the drug may no longer be

13

sold.

14

When

This exemption that the Court of Appeals

15

created was unintended by Congress, and in reaching the

16

conclusion it did the Court of Appeals acted in a manner

17

that was contrary to the way this Court has consistently

18

interpreted the Act.

19

Rutherford, Hynson, and the Park case in 1975 teach us

20

that the Act is to be read broadly and its exceptions

21

narrowly, in order to give full effect to Congress'

22

effort to protect the public.

23

Dotterweich, 3acto-Unidisk*

critical issue in this case we haven't changed our
mind.
If Respondents contention is right that there
has been some agency vacillation» what we are doing now
is returning to where we were in 1933.
coming up with something new.

We are not

And we are recognizing

that the Congressional intent to incorporate ongoing
medical and scientific research, which today leaves no
doubt and is undisputed that differences in inactive
ingredients and manufacturing methods often can cause
differences in the way the products react — taking all
of this into consideration, the fact is that we're
consistent on the main issue, and if in fact we've
changed our mind, then as this Court said in the 1978
NLRB versus Iron Workers case, the agency is certainly
entitled to change its mind and its interpretation
should still stand so long as it's a defensible
interpretation of the statute, as this one certainly
is .

The issue is whether generic

11

drug products, both prescription and nonprescription,

12

which contain active ingredients which are generally

13

recognized as safe and effective are new drugs requiring

14

premarket clearance from the FDA before they're sold.
The issue of prescription-nonprascription

4

represents the various groups which make over the

The Government's reason for trying to narrow

6
7

this case is obvious.

As this Court has recognized in

8

its prior decisions, there are in excess of half a

9

million over the counter products currently on the

10

market.

It is simply impossible for the FDA to approve

11

new drug applications for every over the counter drug,

12

and in fact FDA does not require over the counter

13

products to have new drug approvals, although the

14

statute in question does not distinguish between over

15

the counter and prescription drugs.
In this case both the language of the statute

16
17

and the very, very clear legislative history show

18

conclusively that Congress has never intended that each

19

and every prescription and nonprescription drug product

20

obtain premarket approval from the FDA before it is

17

rejecting was the idea that each and every product had

18

to go for an NOA, because after the product gets on the

19

market in terms of an NOA 99 percent of all products,

20

both in the 1930's and today, are patented.

21

which has the original patent is permitted to put the

22

product on the market for a period of 17 years.

23

issue licenses to several other manufacturers to

24

distribute that product, but the product stays on the

25

market for 17 years in more or less of a monopoly

The company

It may

situation
At the and of 17 years uihan the patent

2
3

expires, other companies then are free to come in and

4

duplicate the product.

5

products» some active ingredients that have been sold*

6

are than generally recognized as safe and effective and

7

can be sold without premarket clearance.
Other products» for example a product like

8
9

After the 17 years some

Qraflex, which was on the market for a year» even though

10

it had FCA approval certainly no one would recognize it

11

as being particularly safe today, and in fact it has

12

been taken off the market.
So the 17-year patent period is a period of

13
14

time during which the community of experts can formulate

15

opinions about whether the active ingredient that is

16

being sold is generally recognized as safe and

17

effective.

18

viewed in that way it makes a tremendous amount of

19

sense.

20

And I think that if the statutory scheme is

The bioavailability and bioequivalence

21

concerns that the Government raises were dealt with by

22

Congress very specifically in the statute that exists

23

through the adulteration requirements.

24

the Act as it has existed since the 1930's, a

25

manufacturer is not allowed to sell a product if its

It is -- under

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

strength» quality or purity falls below compendial

2

standards as recognized in the United States

3

Pharmacopoeia or the National Formulary» both of which

4

are expressly mentioned as guidelines in the statute.
If one opens the United States Pharmacopoeia

5

6

and the National Formulary, one finds mainly definitions

7

of drug substances» and the drug substances are listed

8

and underneath it will give the percentage of the active

9

ingredient that should be found in the product that is

10

sold, and there are disintegration requirements.
The Formulary and the Pharmacopoeia both in

11
12

the 1930's and in the 1980's would not tell a

13

neighborhood pharmacist or a manufacturer exactly how to

14

fabricate a product.

15

tolerances within which the products had to be made in

16

order to comply with compendial standards.
GUESTICNJ

17

Rather, they would sat standards,

Mrs. Greene, your opponent says —

18

I haven't looked, of course, at the original documents

19

— but says that these compendia do also contain some

20

drug products as well as active ingredients.

21

correct?

22
23
24
25

MRS. GREENES

Is that

The compendia do not contain any

drug products at all.
QUESTION:

Not by trade name, but is

everything in there limited to active ingredients,

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

according to your submission?
MRS. GREENS:

What they do contain — if you

3

go back to the 1335 Pharmacopoeia which Congress had

4

before it» most of the items that are listed in the

5

Pharmacopoeia are drug substances.

6
7

8
9

GUESTIGN:

Well, but "most" seems to imply

that there are some that are not.
MRS. GREENES

Well, I was getting to that.

The second thing that the Pharmacopoeia in the 1930's

10

had, they had items called official preparations.

11

the Pharmacopoeia was more or less at that point like a

12

cookbook for the neighborhood pharmacist for how he

13

would fabricate —

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Well, would some of those

preparations include inactive ingredients?
MRS. GREENE:

The recipe that is in the

17

Pharmacopoeia would include inactive ingredients.

18

at the beginning of the 1935 Pharmacopoeia, in the

19

portion we've cited in our brief, it said that

20

pharmacists could substitute a suitable diluant or

21

excipient for the inactive ingredients which were

22

mentioned in the recipe that was put in the

23

Pharmacopoeia.

24
25

And

QUESTION:

But

Is there anything similar to the

Pharmacopoeia, any other book similar to that?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MRS. GREENE

1

Well» the two works referred to

2

in the statute are the United States Pharmacocoeia and

3

the National Formulary, both of which are similar.

4

QUESTION:

They're two separate?

5

MRS. GREENE:

They used to be.

In the 193Q's

6

they tuere separate competitors.

In the seventies USP

7

bought the National Formulary and changed its function

8

slightly.
8ut in no event is any item listed in the

9
10

Pharmacopoeia or the National Formulary a drug product.

11

Instead —
QUESTION:

12

Well, but you said they did list

13

some recipes that the pharmacist might use, which would

14

include both active and inactive ingredients.
MRS. GREENE:

15
16

could substitute —

17

QUESTION:

With the provision that they

That you can substitute the

18

equivalent.

But the mere fact that they are listed in

19

there seems to me to be contrary to your basic

20

argument.
MRS. GREENE:

21

Well, I don't think it's

22

contrary.

I think that in terms of the use of th9 word

23

"articles" in the statute. Congress defined a drug as an

24

article, articles are things listed in the

25

Pharmacopoeia.

And for example, the National Formulary,

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which is mentioned in the statute today» only lists drug

2

substances.

3

Obviously there's a kind of dynamism involved»

4

because the Pharmacopoeia and the Formulary referred to

5

in the statute have changed over a number of years.

6

the one thing that is definitely not mentioned is drug

7

products» and that's why I think it's important» to the

8

extent that there is an ambiguity in the word

9

"articles»" to look at the legislative history in

But

10

determining exactly what Congress meant when it used the

11

term "articles."

12

QUESTION;

Mrs. Greene, in Code Section

13

321(g)(1)(D) it also says that "drug" means "articles

14

intended for use as a component of any article specified

15

in clauses (A)» (8) or (C) of the paragraph.

16

that indicate that all of these excipients are covered?

17

MRS. GREENE;

Doesn't

Well, I think — but the statute

18

still uses the word "article," and the Government has

19

claimed that "article" should be used in its broad

20

generic sense and not in any way related to its use in

21

the Pharmacopoeia and the Formulary.

22

"article" means items in the Pharmacopoeia or the

23

Formulary, it should mean the same thing all the way

24

through the statute, and it shouldn't be changed in that

25

part of the statute.

If in fact

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Thera are various items racognized in the

1

2

Pharmacopoeia uihich are combinations of active

3

ingredients and are specifically listed as combinations

4

in the Pharmacopoeia.
I think that at a minimum the Government has

5
6

tried to take the position partially that the statute is

7

unambiguous and that this Court should not look at the

8

legislative history.

9

that the statute at best is ambiguous and that any

It's our position in our brief

10

ambiguities in terms of the word "articles" should be

11

resolved by reference to the legislative history.
I think in resolving the issue of what the

12

13

word "articles" means» one useful thing that I did, I

14

went through the entire statute and I looked at the word

15

"drug," and every time it said "drug" I substituted

16

"active ingredient" versus "product" in order to

17

determine which interpretation made more sense.

18

percent of the time it didn't make any difference at

19

all.

90

20

3ut in a couple of situations it did make a

21

very large difference, and if I can just find.the one

22

place where it was absolutely most erratic, Section

23

502(i) of the Act says:

24

deemed to be misbranded if it is an imitation of another

25

drug . "

"A drug or device shall be

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Notu* if we taka the word "product*" which is

1

2

what the Government says "drug" means* and substitute it

3

into the Act* that portion of the Act would then mean a

4

product shall be deemed to be misbranded if it is an

5

imitation of another product.

6

generic drugs are imitations of other drugs, and if you

7

use the word "product" in this part of the Act it would

8

effectively outlaw the entire generic drug industry.

Well* of course all

And by substituting in other parts of the

9
10

statute it's clear that Congress could not have intended

11

the word "drug" to be "product," but rather it meant the

12

active ingredient or combination of active ingredients

13

in the product.

14

through the legislative history, Congress has stated

15

that it is relying on the adulteration provisions and

16

adherence to compendial standards to bring -- I'm

17

sorry.

And I think again and again in going

QUESTION:

18

Mrs. Greene, in the section that

19

requires a new drug application to be filed, doesn't it

20

require that they list the inactive ingredients of the

21

drug?

22

MRS. GREENEJ

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, it does.

So doesn't that have to be broader

than the active ingredients, in that section at least?

I

think when you are dealing with the original pioneer

2

drug that is first going on the market» that the testing

and the items that are required are definitely more

extensive than what is required after a product has been

on the market for 17 years and achieved a certain amount

of general recognition.

13

and we didn't plan to do it in the future.

QUESTION:

Are you still of that persuasion?

MRS. GREENE:

Yes* and really the only

difference that the government pointed out* it suggested

that we had to recall everything that we had sold in the

QUESTION:

11

Does this mean that the position of

industry is that the approval by the government actually

enhances the marketability of the generic drug?

whether certain drugs were generally recognized as safe

manufacturers on the market who make approved products,

of selling the products, and the potential exposure

to continue in the practice.
