ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. BATOR, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. BATOR:-

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the validity of two rules issued

11

by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC.

12

Section 210 of the statute commonly known as PURPA, the Public

13

Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.

Under

14

The Government is here because the Court of Appeals

15

for the District of Columbia circuit held these rules invalid.

16

It is the submission of the Government that the Court of Appeals

17

misread the statute, that the rules are valid, and that the

18

ruling of that Court threatens to cripple an important and an

19

exciting experiment that Congress set on when it enacted PURPA.

20

I want to start by giving some background to put the

21

arguments made in our brief and our reply brief in context.

22

This Court is of course familiar with PURPA from its decision

23

last term in FERC and Mississippi.

24
25

In PURPA Congress embarked on an ambitious attempt to
encourage the development of innovative energy efficient
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

technology for producing electric power.

2

to lessen the country's dependance on foreign oil, to end the

3

waste of nonrenewable fossil fuel, and to encourage energy

4

efficiency.

5

The central point was

More specifically, Congress sought to tap the tremen­

6

dous reservoir of potential energy potentially available from

7

renewable sources and from wasted heat produced in industrial

8

and domestic settings.

9

There are two technologies involved.

Cogeneration

10

is the simultaneous production of electricity on the one hand

11

and thermal energy, heat and steam, on the other.

12

production is the generation of relatively small amounts, less

13

than 80 megawatts of electricity, from non-fossil fuel and

14

renewable sources, wind, water, sun, organic materials, and

15

waste.

16

Small power

Cogenerators and small power producers together are

17

referred to as qualifying facilities, QF's for purposes of this

18

case.

19

In enacting PURPA, Congress found that cogeneration

20

of small power production was hindered historically in this

21

country by two things:

22

the interests represented by the Respondent here, sought to

23

preserve their monopoly in the production of electricity by

24

refusing to buy electricity from or selling back of electricity

25

to QF's.

was then to go forward at the state level.

3

✓

I turn now to the first rule in question in this

4

case.

Here the commission addressed the question of what rate

5

is to be paid by a utility buying power from a QF.

6

extensive rule-making proceedings, FERC determined that a two-

7

track system should be established.

8

cogenerators and small power producers already in existence or

9

under construction, those rates were left on a flexible basis

Rates for old capacities,

10

to state commissions.

The second track was for new capacities

11

not yet in existence.

It was, of course, here that the central

12

PURPA purpose of encouraging new firms to come in was in play.

13

The rate system for new capacity was itself sub­

14

divided into two tracks:

15

in contracts at any level agreed to by the parties thus allowing

16

the marked full play.

17

PURPA rate system comes into play.

18

that the utility buying power from the QF must pay the QF the

19

full avoided cost of that power.

both to state implementation and state waivers.

because they proceed in tandem.

2

the very first thing in the regulations, the very first of the

3

two, refers to the full play of negotiated and bargained-for

4

rates, and it is later in Section 304 that we get the full

5

avoided rate — full avoided cost.

6

Actually, in the regulations

I think it is important that there not be a misunder­

7

standing about what the PURPA system and full avoided cost is

8

because ve think that the Court of Appeals really had a mis­

9

understanding of it.

10

The Court of Appeals seemed to think that

this was a very rigid,flat, single uniform rate.

11

Full avoided cost is not really a rate at all.

It

12

is a rate system.

13

simply that the amount paid by the utility to the QF equals

14

the cost the utility would have incurred had that particular

15

quantum of power not been available from the QF if it had

16

to be produced by the utility.

17

cost the utility avoided by having the QF power made available.

18

This means that full avoid cost is anything but rigid.

19

varies from utility to utility.

20

everytime fuel costs go up and down.

21

price of oil, full avoided cost goes down because the power that

22

would have had to have been produced by the utility would have

23

been less.

It is a dynamic rate structure.

It means

Further, it is important to note that even when fuel

prices are flat, full avoided cost varies because the unit cost

QUESTION:

, But is it not true, Mr. Bator, that at

12

all times, even though the full avoided cost may be different

13

at different times of the day and so forth, at all times, it is

14

the maximum rate permitted by the statute?

15
16

MR. BATOR:

The full avoided rate system is the

maximum rate permitted by the statute.;

17

QUESTION:

Well, and at any given time of day, whatever

18

that rate might be if it is equal to the utility's full avoided

19

cost, it is the highest the statute would permit to be charged.

20
21

MR. BATOR:

It is the highest that the statute

permits.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BATOR:

Yes.
But the actual price involved varies

24

not only over these long ranges' but will vary even within a

It did so because it found that the commission did not

1

and their customers, and it concluded that this violated the

2

statutory command that the rate be just and reasonable to

3

consumers.

4

Our submission, Your Honor, is that the Court of

5

Appeals treading in an infinitely complicated and technical

6

area entrusted to an expert commission really misapprehended the

7

statute, misapprehended the commission's regulatory task under

8

the statute, and certainly misunderstood the workings of the

9

PURPA rate.

10

The Court of Appeals asserted that the statute

11

requires basically that QF profits be limited so that all

12

savings or a lot of savings could immediately pass through to

13

customers.

14

This is cost-of-service regulation in which the return to the

15

seller is limited in terms of the seller's cost, but in this

16

statute Congress made its intention clear.

17

report which is quoted at length in our reply brief makes clear,

18

Congress did not wish these entities to be subjected to the

19

cumbersome case-by-case cost-of-service regulation traditional

20

in the utility business.

21

rejected cost-of-service rate making here as a solution because

22

Congress had identified it as the problem.

23

Of course, this is traditional utility regulation.

As the conference

In other words, the commission rightly

we are talking about an industry that is an at-risk open-to-

6

problem of monopoly profits does not exist in this case,

7

and it is in light of this clearly-expressed congressional

8

purpose that FERC determined that rather than rates pitched to

advance was necessary.

11

Now, to return to Justice Stevens:

why start it

12

at 100 percent of avoided cost?

13

The Court of Appeals suggested that might show a savings in

14

some way with utility customers.

15

Why not some lower figure?

Our answer is that the cost had to be set in advance

16

in a world of uncertainty under a statute whose principal

17

purpose was to entice entrants, new firms, into the business.

18

Now, from this advanced perspective, this whole

19

picture of savings and excess profits is very misleading.

20

don't know in advance what the costs of that new QF are going to

21

be.

22

Here is an illustration.

You

23

which has an avoided cost at peak times and a peak demand of

3

and some of the savings could be passed along."

4

You say, "Why

The QF would still be making a profit

The difficulty is that in advance you don't know

5

whether the QF that is going to come along has a four-cent

6

cost or whether it has a six-cent or a seven-cent or an eight-

7

cent or a ten-cent cost.

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, the full avoided cost rule really

doesn't guarantee any QF a profit, does it?

10

MR. BATOR:

Absolutely no, Your Honor.

Absolutely no.

11

It is absolutely a comparative invitation.

12

long as you are more efficient than the utility.

13

illustration, the QF's cost is nine cents, it won't come in

because it can't get more than eight.

here is misleading because it simply forgets the self-correcting

judgment that this was the — and it was a predictive judgement —■

14

that this was a good way to start this experiment should not have

been overturned.

16

This experiment is really already succeeding.

That

17

is, under the PURPA rate there are droves of cogenerators and

small power producers coming in seeking to qualify under this

utilities to hook up, to make the physical interconnection

valid.

to purchase and sell power, and the commission sensibly ruled

14

that the only way to purchase and sell power was to make the

15

physical interconnection so that you can do it.

16

Section 210 of PURPA requires utilities to hook in order

The Court of Appeals said that the only way you can

do this is to use the enormously complicated separate proceeding

provided in Section 210 of the Federal Power Act to accomplish

this.

commitment at 100 percent of avoided cost.

MR. BERLIN:

What would be the term as the rules say.
We use the term, "To the discretion and

If the cogenerator is willing to

commit capacity or energy for any term, then under that rule,

Mr. Berlin, I guess you agree, do you not,

that the standard of review that should be applied in the

whether the commission properly exercised it.

21

MR. BERLIN:

Quite frankly, Justice O'Connor, I

22

think that whether it is arbitrary or capricious, a substantial

evidence need not be reached in this case because it is our

QUESTION:

The utility's costs do

Mr. Berlin, it does appear that adoption

6

of the full avoided cost rule is simply the upper limit of what

7

is permitted under the statute, so the commission appears to

8

have acted within the framework of the statute hut simply set

9

the rate at the upper limits.

10

Isn't it in fact a question of

whether acting in that way is an abuse of discretion?

11

MR. BERLIN:

I'm not sure that is the upper limit

12

permitted by the statute, Justice O'Connor.

13

and the Government concedes this in its reply and it certainly

14

made very clear in the conference report that the upper limit

15

is either the rate produced by application of the 210(b)

16

criteria or the utility's

17

The statute provides

avoided cost whichever is the lower.

We suggest to you that Congress recognized that a

18

just and reasonable rate might well be lower than the utility's

avoided cost, and that's why it mandated the commission to

inquire.

four years from now after it is satisfied that there are viable

cogenerators in the field of changing the full avoided cost

rule so as to pass on the savings?

8

MR. BERLIN:

There is nothing to preclude the

9

commission from changing its rule in the future, and should it

10

change its rule and should it lower the rate below 100 percent,

11

then there would be a possibility.

12

I was just simply pointing out that I think Mr.

there can be savings.

Mr. Bator suggests that the alternative confronting

The commission has directed that in every case in which a co­

10

to comply with the Federal authority.

11

We say that may not do, Justice Stevens, under the

statute.

13

with two different section 210's.

14

We are dealing with Section 210 of the Federal Power Act which

is an interconnection provision.

16

The statute is clear on its face.

Here we are dealing

I hope I don't confuse it.

In PURPA Section 210 which has the rate provision in

it, Congress authorized the commission to exempt cogenerators

18

from certain provisions of the Power Act, but it said, "You

19

may not exempt them from the interconnection provision of the

20

Federal Power Act."

21

For Mr. Bator to prevail before you, he has two

22

hurdles to overcome.

23

in light of 210(e)(3)(b), the non-exemption provision, and if

24

he does, he must establish nontheless that there is implicit

25

authority in PURPA to order interconnection.

He has to show the validity of his rule

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

I suggest to you that the Government's argument

really is illogical.

Congress knew all along that there must be interconnection

authority, and then it goes on and says, "Congress confers'

5

this authority implicitly," though indeed the Congress did know

6

that there had to be interconnection authority.

7

that interconnection authority in the Federal Power Act.

8

That was the pattern followed from the very inception of the

legislation.

The Government contends correctly that

Charles Curtis, was addressed to the House-passed bill, the

4

bill that Mr. Bator says is relevant from a legislative-history

purpose.

6

That bill bears some consideration.
At that time, the House-passed bill contained two

7

different interconnection provisions:

8

interconnection provision with transmission facilities and the

9

cogeneration interconnection provision allowing interconnection

with distribution facilities.

11

What does Chairman Curtis, the chairman of the agency

12

that is to administer the statute,, say?

"You must pass the Federal Power Act interconnection provision

QUESTION:

He said to Congress,

May I ask you one broad question?

Under

18

your view of the statute, would the commission have the power

to adopt a rule that would give the authority to a local

I suggest that if you look at Chairman Curtis's

available under the cogeneration provisions.

then you are dealing with transmission facilities.

3

Congress recognized that.

It recognized the trans­

4

mission facilities present unique problems, and it dealt with

5

those unique problems comprehensively in the 210 provisions.

6

Remember, in the 210 Federal Power Act provision,

7

Congress included from the very inception cogenerators, small

8

power producers, those little guys who were going to produce

9

less than 80 megawatts.

Congress included them because it

10

recognized the potential for reliability problems, and it

11

recognized that was a non-delegable Federal interest that FERC

12

could not abdicate its responsibily.

13

Now, let me say a word about 210(e) (3) (b).

14

Congress has just finished writing 210 of the Federal Power

15

Act through all of the things that I have just described.

16

did it put in 210(e)(3)(b)?

17

Why

It put in 210(e)(3)(b) in conference at the same time

18

it put in a savings clause in the Federal Power Act, 210(12) (e)

19

and at the same time it put in the necessary-to-encourage

20

language.

21

22

Why do they do that?

What's the logical explanation?

What's the fair reading?
Well, the fair reading was that Congress simply

23

did not want the commission to undo what it carefully crafted

24

in the Federal Power Act interconnection provision, and that's

25

why it put in 210 (e) (3) (b).
33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

The Government in its reply brief repeats one argument

2

that the commission had offered and then offers two new argu­

3

ments that hadn't been made before.
First it contends th&t there is really a target

4
5

applicant distinction, that 210(e)(3)(b) is intended to exempt

6

cogenerators when they are targets, but you cannot exempt them

7

from being targets for interconnection orders, and it points

8

out that when you exempt somebody, you exempt them from an

9

obligation, from a duty, from a burden.

10

11

QUESTION:

We have heard about QF's and PURPA.

What

is a target?
MR. BERLIN:

12

A target is the Government's invention

13

for the justification of 210(e)(3)(b) which says that you cannot

14

exempt QF's or cogenerators from the Federal Power Act inter­

15

connection provision.

16

was really saying there was you cannot exempt a cogenerator

17

when it is the target of someone else's efforts to interconnect

18

with it.

The commission says that what Congress

19

Under 210 of the Federal Power Act, a cogenerator

20

can either apply for an interconnection or it can be the un­

21

willing recipient of someone else's interconnection.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BERLIN:

Sort of like a take over.
Yes, and that's when they are a target.

24

The problem is that 210 contains burdens when you are an

25

applicant.

Indeed, the whole purpose of putting 212 in the
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Federal Power Act is to impose burdens on those who are

2

applicants for interconnection orders.

3

Secondly, the Government implies that cogenerators

were included as targets for the first time in conference when

(e) (3) (b) was added.

We suggest to you that does not appear to be the

case.

When discussing cogenerators as targets, they talk about them

as facilities, and that,it implies, buttresses its target-

I point out, however, that 210(e) (1) which is the

provision which gives the commission the authority to exempt

cogenerators from the Federal Power Act, from the Public

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. BATOR, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

11

MR. BATOR:

Yes, Chief Justice, just a few comments.

12

The question raised by Mr. Berlin about the legal

13

obligation under the rules of the utilities to enter into the

14

long-term arrangements, I would like to complicate it in a

15

tricky reading of these rules.

16

We believe and the Government'submits that it

17

requires an enormous torture process to be done to the language

18

to those rules to lead to the conclusion that the utilities

19

have a long-term obligation or have an obligation to enter

20

into long-term contracts with QF's.

21

The simple reading and the straightforward reading

22

of the statute is that in the absence of using the PURPA system

23

you simply — each side is wholly free to bargain or not to

24

bargain to a long-term contract.

25

On the long-term-saving question, Justice Stevens,
36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

on Mr. Berlin's account of this statute, it would be totally

2

inexplicable.

3

since the PURPA rate went into effect to obtain long-term

4

contracts at less than fully avoided cost?

5

Why fix the utilities so they will be unable

The reason that long-term saving will inure to the

6

customer is the commission's rules explicitly provide that the

7

availability of QF power as it comes into play should be taken

8

in account, should be factored into the calculation of

9

fully avoided cost.

QUESTION:

I think I understand your argument, but I

am not entirely sure the commission made that argument.

12

MR. BATOR:

Well, they put it in the rule.
