ORAL ARGUMENT OF JERROLD J. GANZFRIED, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

6

MR. GANZFRIED*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

and may it please the Court, this case concerns the role

8

of the Comptroller General in government procurement,

9

specifically his statutory right to access to records of

10
11

government contractors — books and records.
To put the access provisions in context, it

12

must be recalled that when Congress created the GAO in

13

1921, it directed that the Comptroller investigate all

14

matters relating to the receipt, disbursement and

15

application of public funds, and further directed the

16

Comptroller to make recommendations to Congress looking

17

for greater economy or efficiency in public expenditures.

18

Under that mandate, the Comptroller has, for

19

sixty years, examined the fiscal responsibility and the

20

manner in which federal agencies have discharged their

21

fiscal responsibilities, with an eye towards increasing

22

efficiency and promoting economy in the expenditure of

23

public funis .

24
25

There should be no doubt that this is
precisely the function Congress assigned to the GAO when

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it included the word "application" in the 1921 Act.

2

Congressman Lutes, who proposed that addition, stated

3

that its purpose is to make sure that the Comptroller

4

General shall concern himself not simply with taking in

5

and paying out of money from an accountant's point of

6

view, but that he shall also concern himself with the

7

question as to whether it is economically and

8

efficiently applied.
Now following Horld War II, Congress

9
10

recognized the explosive growth in purchases from the

11

private sector required that the Comptroller be given

12

additional powers so he could discharge these

13

responsibilities properly.

14

passed the access to records statutes at issue in this

15

case.

16

government contractors so that he would have the

17

necessary tool to examine the transactions from both

18

sides.

19

For this reason. Congress

They gave the Comptroller access to records of

This was based on Congress' determination that

20

only with this full information could GAO discharge its

21

duties in a meaningful way.

22

special concern on negotiated contracts — those that

23

were made without advertised solicitation of bids.

24

Because negotiated contracts lack the inherent

25

safeguards of advertised contracts, they are more

And Congress focused

4

1

susceptible to abuse and more likely to result in waste

2

and extravagance.

3

In a word, they pose a greater risk that the

4

government will pay unreasonably high prices, and for

5

that reason Congress determined that negotiated

6

contracts require close supervision and control.

7

fact, negotiated contracts were prohibited by law until

8

World War II.

9

In

In this case, GAO seeks to exercise its

10

statutory right of access to Merck's records relating to

11

only four of the many negotiated contracts Merck has

12

with the government.

13

whether the procurement methods employed adequately

14

protect the government's interest or whether more

15

economical measures could be recommended.

The objective is to determine

16

To put the importance of this effort in

17

perspective, we mention in our brief that in 1973

18

government expenses for prescription drugs totaled £1.6

19

billion, including 3252 million in direct purchases.

20

congressional hearings in 1981, it was estimated the

21

total federal procurement, its aggregate, on

22

pharmaceuticals had blossomed to £2.5 billion, or —

23

that is, £2.5 billion per year, or some 25 percent of

24

total industry sales.

25

aggregate, with a major aspect of federal spending,

So where you are dealing in the

5

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

In

1

where vasts. if there is any, would be a serious drain

2

on resources.

3

But the Court of Appeals' decision cripples

4

GAO's ability to make a meaningful examination of

5

procurement practices by limiting access to records of

6

an estimated nine percent of Merck's costs.

7

has prevented GAO from obtaining the bulk of the

8

information it needs -QUESTIONS

9
10

MR. GANZFRIEDs

That's the estimate in the

article, I believe, by Professor Reike.
QUESTION:

13
14

May I ask you what the basis of the

nine percent figure is?

11

12

The Court

Has he dealing with the prices the

government pays or with retail prices?
MR. GANZFRIEDs

15

He was dealing with — that

16

nine percent figure is not nine percent of a price.

17

It's nine percent of total costs of the manufacturer.

18

QUESTIONS

19

MR. GANZFRIEDs

20

QUESTIONS

21

24
25

I wish I knew.

I don't know.

Well, you don't really know they're

right, then, do you?

You don't know the nine percent —

MR. GANZFRIEDs

22
23

How did he get these cost figures?

We don't know that it's nine

per cent.
QUESTION:

So we really shouldn't rely on the

nine percent figure, should we?

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. GANZFRIED;

The custom

the company has

2

not indicated that it's anything higher than nine

3

percent.

4

cases have been proceeding, but it is an estimate.

5

That is the figure on which this is -- these

QUESTION;

But would your case be any

6

different if it were 90 percent instead of nine

7

percent?

8

us?

9

How does that affect the legal issue before

MR. GANZFRIED:

It affects the legal issue in

10

the sense that the Court of Appeals decision has —

11

assuming it is nine percent or something close to it —

12

prevents GAO from getting the vast majority of documents

13

that it needs in order to determine whether the

14

procurement methods involved in this case were the most

15

appropriate ones.

16
17

QUESTION;

lour purpose is strictly to improve

your procurement methods?

18

MR. GANZFRIED;

19

QUESTION;

That’s our purpose.

When you say that prevents the

20

Comptroller General from getting everything it needs,

21

you ’re not suggesting that Congress in Heik Verba said

22

the Comptroller General can have whatever he needs in a

23

situation like this, are you?

24
25

MR. GANZFRIED;

No, it didn’t.

But it did

grant a broad authorization for access to records.

It

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE„ S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

does have certain express limitations, all of which we

2

complied with here.

3

QUESTION;

And your contention is that the way

4

these costs are allocated, you would have virtually

5

unlimited access to anything because of the way the

6

funds come into the drug companies?

7

MR. GANZFRIED;

Well, not to everything.

The

8

fact that the company does not allocate costs of

9

particular products does make -- does present this case

10

with a certain accounting problem, but that's not

11

necessarily the legal problem that we have.

12

I think we agree with the other side that had
»

13

there been a full allocation of costs that we would be

14

entitled to get everything, but I don't want to leave

15

the impression that we have a claim to unlimited access

16

to every sort of record that this company has,

17

specifically.

non-government work.

19

records.

20

general budgetary information.

21

We are not interested in records of
We are interested only in cost

We have no interest in strategic planning or

QUESTION;

But when you say "records of

22

non-government work", wouldn't — because of the

23

non-allocation of costs, wouldn't you necessarily get a

24

fair amount of records of non-government work under your

25

theory that you are entitled to any records that are —

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

or any records of any products that are paid for out of

2

government funds, whatever it is your claim?

7

ME. GANZFRIED;

Sell, the fact that they

co-mingle the funds —
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, you say "co-mingle" as

if it is some sort of sin, but I —
MR. GANZFRIED;

No, not at all.

We certainly

8

don’t intend to suggest that there is anything wrongful

9

in the comingling, simply to recognize that what we are

10

dealing here with is essentially for this company's

11

costs, as it has been described to us — a large pool of

12

unallocated costs, so that even if we were to go in

13

under this Court of Appeals decision and look at what we

14

estimate to be some nine percent of their costs, we are

15

going to be left with a vast majority of the information

16

that it would be helpful to know whether we should

17

change our procurement methods is not going to be

18

available to us.

19

QUESTION;

Well, suppose they have developed a

20

product like, say, Bufferin.

21

develop it or somebody else does.

22

product like Bufferin, sell it on the market, and never

23

sell any of it -- or say that they sell one percent of

24

it to the government under a negotiated product

25

contract, 99 percent on the open market.

I don’t know whether they
But they develop a

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Is it your contention you can have access to

1

2

all of the records dealing with Bufferin?

3

MB. GANZFRIED:

We don’t want the records of

4

their sales to the public other than to determine that

5

there have been substantial sales to the general public,

6

to answer that specific question.
QUESTION:

7

Well, that puzzles me, because it

8

would seem to me that comparable sales to private

9

customers might be the most relevant to the

10

determination of whether the government’s getting a fair

11

deal.
MR. GANZFBIED:

12

Well, under the statutes there

13

is the built-in assumption that a contract that —

14

something that is sold at a catalog price item and is

15

sold in substantial quantity to the general public has a

16

built-in, oh, built-in mechanism for assuming that there

17

has been competition.

18

you assume that there has been competition, if the

19

government pays no higher than -QUESTIONt

20

Because it's sold to the public,

Well, then you are not interested

21

in any records pertaining to prices that are below a

22

fair market price established by a catalog or something

23

like that.

24
25

MB. GANZFBIEDi

Well, the point I was getting

to is that it may be, in this industry, where they

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

suggest that they pay no attention to their costs when

2

they set their prices — a contention which I suggest is

3

belied by their answers to interrogatories — it may be

4

that in this industry the fact that something is sold at

5

a catalog price and is sold in substantial quantities to

6

the public provides no real assurance that there has

7

been competition.
QUESTION;

8
9

doesn’t.

Well, either it does or it

If we assume for a moment it does not provide

10

any assurance, then I should think, the records you would

11

want would be the records of sales of the company to

12

other private customers who buy more or less as you do.

13

It would be the most relevant, I think.
HR. GANZFRIED;

14

Well, it might be the sort of

15

thing that accountants do,

16

relatively small sampling to be able to determine —
QUESTION;

17
18

where you need only some

But you disclaim any interest in

those records, as I understand your argument.
MR. GANZFRIED;

19

Well, to the extent that they

20

are records that could verify the records that we do

21

want, we might have some interest in sampling of them.
QUESTION;

22

Do you or do you not want to see

23

records pertaining to sales by the drug company to other

24

customers?

25

HR. GANZFRIED;

We would want to see some of

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that

2

QUESTION:

So there is really no limit on your

3

demand, then, in terms of kinds of records that you are

4

seeking.
MR. GANZFRIED:

5

Well, there are -- let me

6

suggest that as I understand Merck's position at this

7

point, they would be willing to give us information of

8

sales to other customers at the same prices in order to

9

substantiate the fact that they have in fact made sales

10

of substantial quantities to the general public.
So I don’t think that sets a limit on either

11

12

position.
QUESTION:

13
14

You’re not satisfied with that.

You 're not satisfied with that, as I understand it.
MR. GANZFRIED:

15
16

records.

17

records.

No, because those aren’t cost

What we're really interested in is cost

18

Now we should keep in mind —

19

QUESTION:

Would that include all sort of

20

unallocated expenses engaged in research and

21

development ?
MR. GANZFRIED:

22

Well, since everything that

23

they do in research and development, so far as we know,

24

is unallocated, yes, it would address that.

25

you —

I can give

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

QUESTIONi

When you say "would address it", it

would take it in, wouldn’t it?

3

HR . GANZFRIED:

It would take it in.

Now, to

4

be sure, we don’t want to look at all of their

5

experiments and know what their scientific formulas are,

6

to go in and say we think you should be conducting

7

research in this area and not in that area.

8

other hand, we do want to know, in establishing costs

9

for particular products, whether most of their research

On the

10

is in the pharmaceutical area at all, or whether it’s in

11

the veterinary medicine area, or in the category that

12

they, for their internal allocations, call "other.”
So we would want to have that kind of

13
14
15

breakdown.
QUESTION;

Well, is the mission of the

16

Comptroller General to inquire into contracts with the

17

government or in terms of the pricing, or is part of his

18

mission to see whether on the open market the drug

19

companies are charging more than they should?

20

MR. GANZFRIED;

The Comptroller General's

21

interest is in the price that the government pays, and

22

whether the procurement methods that are used by the

23

government are appropriate.

24
25

QUESTION;

But the inquiry would appear, in

many respects, to go way beyond that.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. GANZFRIED;

It may be that information is

2

obtainei that has implications beyond that, but the

3

Comptroller General’s purpose and his objective in

4

undertaking the study is to provide a check on the

5

procurement methods, to determine whether, for example,

6

negotiated, fixed-price contracts really are the most

7

suitable way to purchase pharmaceuticals, or whether, in

8

this industry where, so far as we can tell, the costs

9

bear no relation to the prices that are charged, we

10

might be better off going to a cost-plus system for

11

buying pharmaceuticals.
It may be that the assumption that we have

12
13

that because this is a catalog price item, that there

14

need not be any cost and pricing data submitted to the

15

government at the time of negotiation.

16

assumption that might have to be rethought in this

17

ind ustry.

But that's an

So these are the kind of recommendations that

18
19

might come out of the study.

20

conduct the study and we find that this system is just

21

great and we wouldn’t want to touch it at all and would

22

recommend that it remain in place exactly as it is.

23

the point is, we cannot —
QUESTION:

24
25

it anyway?

I mean, it may be that we

But

What authority do you have to touch

Your authority is just to stop buying from

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

these people, isn't it?

2

touch the way they — what authority do you have to do

3

anything except say we won't buy anything from you any

4

more?

5

HR. GANZFRIED:

You say you're not going to

The only authority that the

6

Comptroller General has is to make recommendations to

7

the procuring agencies and to Congress.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION!

Right.

I mean, you said you're not

going to touch the way they do business.

I don't see

how you've got any -HR. GANZFRIED:

If they — well, for example,

12

if they want to charge the prices that they charge and

13

we feel that it's not a price that we ought to pay,

14

there's not going to be a deal.

15

continue to maintain their books of accounts on an

16

unallocated basis, they can continue to do that.

17

QUESTION:

If they want to

Couldn't you do that anyway?

18

Couldn't you say we won't buy from you unless you show

19

us your records?

20
21

22
23
24
25

HR. GANZFRIED:

That might be one of the

recommendations that would come out of this.
QUESTION:

And you've had several years to

think up that one.
HR. GANZFRIED:

Well, unfortunately, we have

had all too many years in this case before we have

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

gotten any information

2

But I think what I'd like to focus in on are

3

the particular aspects of the cost items that the Court

4

of Appeals has barred us from getting, and those are,

5

briefly, advertising, which you would think would be

6

easily allocated, general administration, distribution

7

and research and development, and since these —

8
9
10

QUESTIONS
me.

You are runinng a little fast for

You are saying advertising, which can easily —

easily — be allocated.
MR. GANZFRIEDs

11

A great many -You would think that the

12

company would know what it’s spending, what products

13

it's spending its advertising on.
QUESTIONS

14
15

Oh, a great many companies just

advertise the company.

16

MR. GANZFRIEDs

17

QUESTIONS

Fine.

Television and newspapers and

18

magazines constantly have Exxon or Weyerhaeuser -- no

19

particular product — and these are all conglomerates

20

now.

21

Now how would you allocate that?
MR. GANZFRIEDs

Well, accountants can

22

certainly do it.

First of all, you take out of that

23

group the advertising that is product-specific, and

24

certainly you could apply it to particular products,

25

And then. once you are left with the bulk that you would

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

call this corporate- name or image advertising -- if I

2

can call it that —■

3

QUESTION;

4

Hell, that's not -- your answer now

is different from your previous statement.

5

MR. GANZFRIED;

Then, you see, you'd be able

6

to allocate it.

7

advertising breaks down, whether it is product-specific

8

or whether it is the corporate name and the image that

9

is being projected.

10

Well, I don’t know how Merck's

But that is something we would want

to find out.

11

Now I think one of the unfortunate —

12

QUESTION;

How is this going to help the

13

Comptroller General?

He probably has a right to lots of

14

things, maybe even if they don't help him, but at least

15

part of your argument seems to be that it's going to be

16

of genuine assistance to get these figures.
How is it going to help the Comptroller

17
18

General in advising the agencies whether or not to

19

purchase from Merck or Congress whether to pass some law

20

specifying purchasing policies how much Merck spends on

21

advertising?
MR. GANZFRIED;

22

Hell, the interest in

23

advertising is only a halfway measure to getting a

24

notion of what their total costs are for their

25

products.

If we find out, for example, that on a

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

per-thousand-pill basis the products involved in this

2

case cost the government from a range of $21 for Diuril

3

to $49 to $50 for Aldoraet, if we were to find out, for

4

example, that the company’s costs for Aldomet are $2 per

5

QUESTIONi

May I ask this question since

you’re speaking of recommendations that might be made?
Suppose the government is considering buying a

13

drug product that is marketed by two companies and one

14

of the companies spends ten percent on research and

15

development and five percent of that is on pure research

16

and development, trying to reach out ten, twenty years

17

from now to find a cure for cancer, for example, and the

18

other company spends only two percent on total research

19

and development.

20

Obviously, the latter’s costs are going to be

21

somewhat less.

The government, would it feel compelled

22

to buy only from the company that did two percent

23

research and development, foreclosing or penalizing a

24

company that spent enormous percentage, comparatively,

25

on research that might be of enormous benefit to the

1
2

government as well as other people?
MR. GANZFRIED*

The answer to that is that the

3

government's purpose is not to tell companies that they

4

are spending too much or too little on research or to

5

penalize companies for spending too much or too little

6

on research.

costs the companies to make the products that we’re

paying for.

MR. LACOVARA;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court.
This is a statutory construction case.

The

22

argument that has just been presented on behalf of the

23

government emphasizes why the Comptroller General or his

24

counsel today believes that it might be a fine idea for

25

the Comptroller General to have access to the extensive

2

played no part in the negotiation or pricing of the

3

contract for the goods sold to the government.

4

That position may make sense.

It may not make

5

sense as a matter of policy.

6

right answer to that question is.

exercise, when, as the Third Circuit recently put it, he

9

concluded — "he", the Comptroller General — that he

I don't know what the
All I know is that in

10

had no viable option but to do what Senator Nelson had

11

urged him, the Comptroller General personally testified

12

before Senator Nelson's Committee that this very

13

exercise would be, in his words, "a waste of time."

14

And he said at that point — and the passage

15

is quoted on pages three and four of our brief -- that

16

since the government always buys pharmaceutical products

17

below the cost at which these products are sold in

18

substantial quantities to the general public, he, as he

19

put it, "found it a little hard on its face to say that

20

the government is not getting good prices."

21

QUESTIONs

Well, isn't that a little bit like

22

a prosecutor saying "We don't think we have much cause

SR. LACOVARA;

Justice Rehnquist, I think, this

case is a little bit different because we're talking

here about the use of a coercive power given under a

limited purpose.

But is Mr. Bowsher bound by Hr.

MR. LACOVARA;

I think it’s not quite whether

20

he’s bound by that. Justice Rehnquist, but whether or

21

not when one passes beyond the scope of access that the

22

government is demanding one gets to the question whether

this was a bona fide or legitimate inquiry in the first

place.

that if demand for access to private records under

5

motivated by the purpose for which that power was

6

granted, then the demand should not be enforced.
I do want to emphasize, though, that is not

That is —
QUESTION:

That would be part of the audit

16

function, would it not?

17

MR. LACOVARA:

Exactly.

If the price of the

18

contract had been negotiated on the basis of cost,

19

because Merck represented that it would incur a certain

20

level of costs in performing the contract, or if the

21

contract price itself was left open to be based upon the

22

costs actually incurred, then there is no question

23

whatsoever that that would be within the traditional

24

audit function that the Comptroller General has and that

25

this access statute permits him to enforce.

there are any such contracts, and one would have thought

that if there had been any the Comptroller General,

7

knowing that this whole dispute concerned the industry’s

8

position that cost records are highly confidential and

9

that they are not relevant to non-cost-based records, if

10

the Comptroller knew of any such cost-based contracts in

11

the industry he would have selected those as the

12

predicate for his access demands.

13

I'm not sure whether Merck has any cost-plus
I rather doubt that it

There is nothing in the record to indicate that

He didn't, and what we have here is an access

demand that lists four specific, non-cost-based

15

contracts, all of which the government admits are for

16

standard commercial items sold to the general public at

17

catalog prices or otherwise based on prices that are set

18

in the competitive marketplace.

19

I might at this point pick up on one of the

20

colloquys that was held during my colleague's discussion

21

with the Court about whether the GAO has any belief or

22

any suspicion that the prices for these contracts were

23

not reasonable in any sense.

2

reasonableness of the price.

3

When the senior GAO official who is involved

4

in this matter, Mr.

5

and Welfare Division, was being deposed, I asked him the

6

question.

7

Merck made excessive or unreasonable profits on any of

8

the four contracts in question?

the Joint Appendix.

Ahart, the Director of the Manpower

Is there any specific reason to believe that

The answer in full is;

10

This is page 76-A of

"No.

The General

11

Accounting Office has no reason to believe that Merck

12

made unreasonable or excessive profits on the four

13

contracts."

14
15

All of this, however, should be considered, I
think, in the context —

ME. LACOVAEA*

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Pardon me?

If that's the fact, what's the big

secret?
MR. LACOVAEA:

The secret. Justice Stevens, is

22

that the government wants not the records that Merck has

23

offered, which are the records to show that the prices

24

that were agreed upon in these contracts were actually

25

based upon catalog prices at which these products were

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sold to the government.

2

They have said under this statute, which has,

3

we think, not only limited language but a purpose, a

4

background of legislative intent that shows a narrow

5

range of authority, that they want access to all of

6

Merck's cost records, except to the extent — and it’s a

7

little hard to pin down precisely what the theory is

8

since it has shifted a bit — except to the extent, as

9

we understand it -- and this picks up on Justice —

10

Judge Mikva's dissenting opinion in the lower court --

11

that Merck bears the burden of showing that costs are

12

specifically allocated by the company to some other

13

product.

14

Now that's an interesting inversion of the

15

statutory language, which says the Comptroller General

16

may only get access to records that are directly

17

pertinent to and involve transactions relating to a

18

specific contract.

19

this case is that since these clauses must be included

20

in any contract for the purchase of more than '$10,000 in

21

goods, even for off-the-shelf kinds of standard

22

commercial items, under the government's theory — and

23

this is the way it has expressly articulated it again

24

this afternoon — the government, through the GAO, is

25

entitled to examine all of the costs that Merck has

What that means, Justice Stevens, in

incurred for an indefinite period of time -- Kr. Ahart

2

said maybe as much as 20 years.

3

Merck, in a year in which these contracts were

4

signed, had costs of about $1 billion, including about

5

£100 million in research and development costs.

6

the numbers have jumped to over $2 billion for general

7

costs and £300 million for research and development.

8

The government's theory is that it's entitled to access

9

to all of those costs under this authority.

That's all we

I suppose you wouldn't tell them that either,

18
19

Supposing you had for internal management

would you?
MR. LAC0VARA;

Well, what we would do on a

21

cooperative basis. Justice Stevens, is another matter.

22

As you know from looking at the record here, Merck was

23

one of the companies that came forward voluntarily when

24

GAO was interested in doing an economic study and we

25

said we will give you access to a lot of information if

2

you'll keep it confidential.
The record makes perfectly clear, as every

3

court that has ailressed this question has recognized,

4

that the GAO said it was prepared to give the industry

5

this kind of commitment of confidentiality for some of

6

the reasons that emerged in the Chief Justice's colloquy

7

with opposing counsel.

8

said we want you to get individual product cost

9

information to give to us so that we can disclose it.

10

But Senator Nelson and his staff

It’s in the Joint Appendix.

Nr.

Ahart

11

testified that the only reason the GAO did not give the

12

confidentiality pledge when Merck and the other

13

companies said they would produce the costs was the

14

refusal of the Senators to accede to it.

15

QUESTION*

Does that mean that your underlying

16

interest is not so much in keeping the information from

17

GAO as the danger that it might become -- fall into the

18

public domain?

19

MR. LACOVARAi

That's one concern.

When we

20

filed the complaint, Justice Stevens, we said that the

21

scope of the demand made by the Comptroller General

22

proposed to injure Merck in two respects.

24

it is highly important, as I think the Chief Justice's

25

question suggested, whether competitors know how a

That was

14

It allowed access in July 1975.

When I asked

15

Mr. Ahart on deposition what was the status of that

16

inquiry, he testified — and this can be found in the

17

Joint Appendix — that the — a team of GAO auditors had

18

been on site at Hoffman-LaRoche’s headquarters for’15

19

months and were expected to be there a few more months.

20

It turned out that in July

21

team was still there, and after some of the lower courts

22

began to rule that the GAO had overstepped its bounds,

23

Hoffman-LaRoche finally said enough is enough.

24

would appear on Joint Appendix 127-A, Justice Stevens.

25

So what we have here is a demonstrated track

2

can send teams of accountants to live at the

3

headquarters of a contractor, spend years there -- far

4

more than outside auditors find it necessary to spend

5

time to do the annual certifications for the SEC.

6

think, that makes it perfectly evident that the position

7

of contractors like Merck and the others that this

8

demand is not only abstractly in excess of the GAO's

9

legal authority but is in fact a real substantial threat

10
11

to the company’s functioning.
Now opposing counsel also said that we in our

12

reply brief had mistakenly said that the GAO had opposed

13

a confidentiality provision in this case.

14

think the Court should be aware, looking at record

15

reference 58, when Merck moved for the addition of

16

confidentiality provisions to the judgment, a motion

17

that was subsequently granted, the GAO opposed that

18

motion, saying it was prepared to agree to

19

confidentiality only if the District Court granted the

20

full relief that the government had been seeking, but

21

that since the District Court had allowed access only to

22

direct production cost records the government thought

23

that it should be under no obligation to preserve the

24

confidentiality of those records.

item 58
The key point, though, in this case is that

3

it's a statutory construction case.

4

in the government's certiorari petition has in it at

5

least four explicit terms of limitation.

6

the government's petition for certiorari says, in

7

relevant part,

8

representatives are entitled" -- first limitation --

9

"until the expiration of three years after final payment

10

to examine any books or papers'* — that is number two —

11

"directly pertaining to" — number three — "and

12

involved transactions relating to” -- and then, number

13

four — "the contract."

The statute printed

Page two of

"The Comptroller General and his

14

Tn the clause that implements this statutory

15

requirement, which is in the record and is also quoted

16

in the government's answer to the complaint in the Joint

17

Appendix, the government has refined that to make it

18

clear that access is to be granted only to records that

19

are directly pertinent to and involving transactions

20

relating to this contract.

21

So if the English language means anything, it

22

means that both the statutory grant of authority and the

23

contract clause which implements the authority focus

24

directly, narrowly, specifically on the transactions

25

involving that contract.

That, we think, logically,

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

naturally suggests that what the government is entitled

2

to are records relating to the negotiation of the

3

contract, the performance of the contract, and the

4

support for payment under the contract.
Other procurement statutes make that pattern

5
6

manifest.

We refer to three or four of them -- the

7

Renegotiation Act, the Truth in Negotiations Act, the

8

agency access statute enacted in 1968 to give the

9

agencies, as the Congress was told, the same power of

10

access that the GAO had been given in 1951, and the cost

11

account -- the government cost accounting standards

12

statute.
All of those are congressional manifestations

13
14

of the view that where a product being sold to the

15

government is a standard commercial item sold to the

16

general public at a catalog price or in some other

17

competitive setting, the government does not have any

18

legitimate interest in knowing what the contractor's

19

costs are.

20

Comptroller General testified in 1972, are protected

21

when the government is assured -- and Nerck is prepared

22

to give these records to the GAO — that the price at

23

which the government purchased the items was based on

24

and not more than the catalog price at which the same

25

products were sold to the public.

The government's interests, as the

1

We, both sides, exhaustively discussed the

2

legislative history, what is suggested by the language

3

of the statute and what the legislative history shows.

4

Ther has also been a debate about whether the GAO has

5

consistently interpreted the statute since 1951 or

6

whether, as several courts and commentators have said,

7

at best it's interpretation is checkered.

8

I think it is worthwhile, though, to see what

9

the GAO told Congress it thought the statute meant when

10

the amendment to the permanent procurement statutes in

11

the fall of 1951 was being considered.
QUESTION;

12

Mr. Lacovara, you haven’t yet

13

covered in your oral argument, have you, your objections

to what the District Court did give to the Comptroller

15

General?
MR. LACOVARAi

16
17
18
19
20

Well, I’ll deal with that right

now .
QUESTION;

Well, no, I just meant to keep

track of you in a way.
MR. LACOVARA;

I should have given you an

21

outline of where I wanted to go, and I apologize for not

22

having done that.

23

The thrust of what I was suggesting a moment

24

ago about how the language of the statute reads

25

underlies what we think is the objection to the District

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Court's holding.

2

in this case — and we recognize that three circuits, at

3

least — well, four circuits, including the

4

Hewlett-Packard decision in the Ninth Circuit -- have

5

held that under this statutory authority the Comptroller

6

General can get access to direct production costs, even

7

for — under a non-cost-based contract.
Our view is that the proper reading of the

8
9

The District Court, as you know, held

statute is that no cost records are directly pertinent

10

to a contract if the contract is not cost-based, either

11

because there were no representations made about costs

12

during the negotiation of the price or because the price

13

itself does not vary with costs.
If there is to be a conclusion -- and one

14
15

cannot blink the fact that at least four circuits have

16

held that some costs are directly pertinent, but they

17

have drawn the line at direct production costs -- if

18

some costs are pertinent, then that seems to be, as

19

these four courts have held, a reasonable place to draw

20

the line.

21

But our submission this afternoon is that when

22

you look at the terms of the statute, consider the

23

purpose of the statute, which was to enable the GAO to

24

see whether the contracting officers or the government

25

or the sales agents for the suppliers had overstepped

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

their bounds either by making false, inadvertently

2

mistaken, or inaccurate predictions about cost, or

3

whether the contracting officer from the government

4

standpoint had neglected, as the GAO has found in some

5

instances is the case, to ask for cost information when

6

that information should have been provided, then that’s

7

the situation in which cost records may be pertinent.
Otherwise, cost records are simply not

8

9
10

directly pertinent and do not involve transactions
relating to the contract.
QUESTION;

11

Is it not true that even in the

12

kind of contract we have here you do have the clause in

13

your contract, though, so we’re not necessarily confined

14

to knowing what the statute means or even if it was just

15

intended to apply primarily to other contracts.

16

agree to this provision in these contracts.
NR. LACOVARA:

17

You did

Yes, that’s correct. Justice

18

Stevens.

It’s — the statute requires it to be

19

included.

20

shown by the record — there's a lot of forms that are

21

issued in connection with contracts and the contracting

22

officer just checks a box.

23

the contracts this clause was not physically included,

24

but we’re not arguing that that has any legal

25

significance.

Generally what happens is — and this is

In fact, in one or two of

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Appropos of that point, though, the three or

2

four circuits that have now concluded that the GAO’s

3

argument exceeds the statutory language have reasoned

4

that not only is this in excess of what the statute

5

provides but that because this authority comes in

6

through a contract no government contractor could

7

reasonably construe the language to be as broad as the

8

government now argues it is.

9

I think, it's relevant also in that connection

10

to note that before this dispute arose the government

11

had never, as far as we can tell, sought to obtain

12

indirect cost information in connection with any

13

non-cost-based contract.

14

which until this dispute was the high water mark in this

15

area, granted the Comptroller General access only to

16

direct production costs, far short of what is being --

17

QUESTION:

The Hewlitt-Packard case,

Mr. Lacovara, it would seem to me

18

that it would make it difficult for the government to

19

know that Merck's position was correct, that the price

20

of the goods bore no relation whatever to cost of

21

production, without giving the government access to

22

enough of the records to check the veracity of that

23

proposal by Merck.

24
25

ME. LACOVARA:

The position. Justice O'Conner,

is that this access authority is designed to let the GAO

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

check and see whether the contractor and the purchasing

2

agent on behalf of the government did something improper

3

or negligent in the course of negotiating the contract.

4

Under the procurement statutes there is an elaborate

5

formal record that is established about the basis on

6

which the price being offered to the government was

7

being based.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

Of course, if you limit — if

that's the limited purpose, you have already won your
lawsuit, I guess.
HE. LACQVARA;

11

That's one ground for us to

12

win. Justice White.

13

government, through the GAO, can come in to examine the

14

representations that were made to the contracting

15

officer that the price being quoted was a catalog price

16

and that the price actually being offered to the

17

government was below the price at which these items have

18

been sold.

19

But we have never denied that the

GAO has conceded in interrogatories and on

20

deposition that in fact the — these items were priced

21

on the basis of catalog price lists or on the basis of

22

other price competition and there was no actual

negotiation.

Comptroller General has no function beyond verifying

QUESTION;

Just the point is simply that the

5

verification might take you into some areas that are

6

more in keeping with the District Court and the Court of

7

Appeals order, wouldn’t it?
NR. LACOVARA:

8
9

We agree that the GAO would

have the right to examine records that show that the

10

government was getting the products that it contracted

11

for.

12

that what was being produced was the product involved,

To some extent, that might include records showing

3

and so there might be access through that mechanism,

4

Justice O'Conner, to direct production costs showing

5

that materials and packaging and the rest were as

6

represented.
But the principal argument is that costs are

7
8

not directly pertinent to and do not involve

9

transactions relating to the contract when it is a

20

category called a non-cost-based contract.

Merck submits its price and

were low enough.

12

MR. LACOVARA;

13

QUESTION;

That’s in part what the —

Would it be legal for the

14

government to say, even though it isn’t a cost-plus

15

contract and it isn’t a bid contract, if they refuse to

16

deal with anybody unless they tell them their costs?
MR. LACOVARA;

17
18

Oh, no, nothing illegal about

that at all.
QUESTION;

19

So the government could tell Merck,

20

well, look, don’t send us any — when you send us your

21

MR. LACOVARA;

That’s correct.

Colonel

Brafogel, in fact, who is in charge of all

18

wrote back and said we recognize your industry position

19

and we will not in the future ask for cost information.

20

That’s record reference 23.

So this matter was expressly thrashed out and

the government decided it would rather buy at the price

The government's theory, I suggest, has very

little relationship to the language of the statute or

any of the purposes that one could possibly glean from

then, as several courts have said, we can go no further

than direct production costs.

7

If any records are pertinent,

But the notion that under this authority the

8

government is entitled to demand access to what, from

9

the Roche experience and the government’s own

10

articulation, might be billions of dollars worth of cost

11

records because a contractor sold off the shelf a

12

standard commercial item worth $10,000, that seems to

13

have very little connection with the language of the

14

statute or its purpose.

15

I would also like to emphasize in my

16

conclusion that despite the predictions that the heavens

17

will fall unless the various Circuits are repudiated on

18

this subject, this case is truly unprecedented.

19

government, as far as the record shows, has never

20

obtained access to indirect cost records in connection

21

with a cost — non-cost-based product.

22

only allowed access to direct production costs.

In this record# GAO first said it used its

access authority to audit $800 million in contracts in

1974 and '75.

sheepishly,

either accepting the decision of the Court of Appeals in

this case or Nerck's somewhat broader position would

When we asked were any of these

well, no, they were all cost-based.

So

10

have no impact on the use of this statute as the GAO has

11

actually asserted it over the past 30 years.

12

The same conclusion applies to the argument

13

that this power can be used to conduct economic studies

14

of industries in order to see how the procurement

process is working.

16

this power for that purpose, back came the answer, yes,

17

on five occasions.

18

look at each of those, they turned out to be individual

contract audits of cost-based contracts or, in one

instance, what the government refers to as the Hv-80

auditing a decision by the Navy Department to accept a

contractor's representation that steel plates for

nuclear submarines were commercial products.
