ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. POFF, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. POFFi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court, the Petitioner in this case urges this
10 Court to hold that the American Postal Workers Union,
11 which has been adjudicated in this case to have violated
12 its duty of fair representation to the appellant, in
13 fact in this case held to have done so maliciously,
14 recklessly, and in callous disregard of his rights, be
15 held responsible to Bowen for that portion of his
16 increased wage loss which occurred while he was seeking
17 the redress in the courts which the union has been found
18 to have bean responsible for seeking for him through the
19 process of arbitration.
20

This case presents the Court with all the

21 parties and with the necessary evidential underpinning
22 with which to refine the apportionment of damage test or
23 principles which this Court has enuniciated in a long
24 line of cases beginning with Vaca versus Sipes,
25 extending down to Czosek versus O'Mara, and to Hines

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 versus Anchor Motor Freight, ani at least by passing
2 reference in two cases last year, the Clayton case and
3 the Mitchell case, both being Section 301 cases.
4

He think, that this Court has been consistent,

5 although it has not met this issue squarely, in holding
6 that the apportionment of responsibility in these cases
7 between the employer and the union should be predicated
8 upon relative fault.

The Court in Vaca and I think the

9 Court in subsequent decisions has indicated that the
10 union should not be responsible for those damages that
11 have been caused by the employer, nor should the
12 employer be held responsible for those damages caused by
13 the union.
14

The closest decision that this Court has had

15 to the case immediately before you is the Hines versus
16 Anchor Motor Freight case.

There, the Court did not

17 have to meet this issue head on, although it was clear
18 that it was going to have to be met on remand, and you
19 will recall

that Justice Stewart in a concurring opinion

20 which was not dissented from by any member of the Court,
21 expressed his belief that the apportionment of loss of
22 wages in that case should be made on the basis of fault,
23 and that the employer who had achieved a successful
24 arbitration award in that case should not be held
25 responsible for any damages that had accrued subsequent

4

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to the arbitration award and prior to the time that

2 there would be a determination of — an untainted
3

determination of the employee’s rights and his

4

determination that he should return to work.

5

QUESTION;

Hr. Poff, you referred to Justice

6

Stewart’s concurring opinion and commented that no one

7

dissented from it.

Do you ordinarily think you find

8 dissents from concurring opinions?

HR. PDFFs

I would assume not, sir, though I

would not think it unusual perhaps to find —
QUESTION;

I don’t ask you to predict the

vagaries of the Court, sir.

13

(General laughter.)

14

HR. POFF;

I would not think you reticent to

15

do so if you saw fit, but in this instance, at least, I

16

think it is fair to comment at least that that statement

17

was made by Justice Stewart, and I have seen nothing to

18

indicate disagreement with it.

19

I would suggest that the fact that you do have

20 the National Labor Relations Board in this kind of
21

setting, in unfair labor practice cases, 8B cases,

22 assessing back wage responsibility against unions
23

indicates that there is certainly nothing anathema as

24

far as national labor policy is concerned against

25

assessing back wages in these kinds of situations where

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unions have failed to represent employees fairly.

There

2 is nothing wrong with the national labor policy in
3

assessing back wages, because in fact Section 10(c) of

4

the National Labor Relations Ret expressly authorizes

5

the National Labor Relations Board to remedy cases,

6

discrimination cases in that fashion.

7

In order to adopt the position that the RPWU

8 asserts in this case would, we suggest, emasculate the
9

very purpose of the duty of fair representation.

10

are in these cases, we suggest, only about three

11

elements of damages that can ever be assessed against a

12

union for a breach of its duty of fair representation.

13

One would be the possibility of back pay.

14

would be attorneys* fees.

15

and related items of damage.

16

There

A second

A third would be court costs

If the union is successful in the position in

17

this case that it is in no event liable for back pay

18

responsibility, that only leaves attorneys' fees and

19

court costs.

Attorneys' fees, as was suggested no later

20 than last term with the Summit Valley Industries case, a
21

secondary boycott case in which this Court refused to

22 impose attorneys' fees against unions, and reiterated
23

the American rule, it is unlikely that you will ever

24

have or that you will often have a situation such as

25

this, where you do have a bad faith finding below which

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would justify the imposition of even attorneys' fees

2 against unions, and unless this Court is going to carve
3

out an exception or unfair representation cases in the

4

attorneys' fee area, another exception to the American

5

rule, then attorneys' fees themselves would not in cases

6 — in most cases of unfair representation be an element
7

8
9

of damage.
That would leave only a court cost type of
figure, which in the present case might be indicative of

10

what you could expect in other cases, $1,463 divided

11

jointly, so a liability would be imposed upon the union

12

which would be miniscule, which would in fact be less

13

than the cost that they would incur to have processed

14

the grievance properly to begin with.

15

So, we suggest that to accept the position of

16

the American Postal Workers Union in this case is to

17

render the duty of fair representation, a duty without

18

any sanctions to enforce it, because —

19

QUESTION*

hr. Poff, don't you think that if

20 there is any reguirement of agregiousness in order to
21

find that a union has breached the duty of fair

22 representation, that many of those will be accompanied
23

by a finding of malice or bad faith?

I mean,

24

negligence, I would think, wouldn't be sufficient to

25

support a finding of liability againt the union.

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. POFF:

You will recall, sir, that in Vaca

2 and Sipes, two tests are really stated.

There is the

3 arbitrary and perfunctory standard referred to on one
4 occasion and the arbitrary bad faith and discriminatory
5 language in another.

I think it has generally been

6 accepted that the appropriate rule is arbitrary bad
7 faith or discriminatory conduct by unions to constitute
8 unfair representation.
9

Certainly, if there is -- there have been

10 cases, however, which have gone off on essentially a
11 negligence standard,

relying upon the Court's arbitrary

12 and perfunctory language, and I would suggest that in
*

13 those cases, that would not be a necessary finding of
14 fault on the part of the union to justify the imposition
15 of attorneys' fees.

And therefore, if the result urged

16 in this case by the appellee is successful, then the
17 duty of

fair representation which was judicially created

18 to achieve some balance and responsibility in this area
19 will be rendered of no effect.

20

There is also, of course, the national labor

21 policy which

is well recognized in support of the

22 arbitral process, and we would submit that the — that
23 employers in this context submit to an arbitration
24 agreement with

the thought that they will act as they

25 deem appropriate under

the facts of an individual case,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the union will, if it deems it necessary, grieve,

2 and that this matter will then ultimately be settled by
3 arbitration within a relatively and — a time frame that
4 can be relatively — be ascertained and predicted with
5 some degree of certainty.
6

If, as in this case, the union can by failing

7 to take a case to arbitration expand indefinitely the
8 period of lost wage exposure that an employer has, then
9 the employer's intentions in entering into this
10 collective bargaining agreement with a grievance and
11 arbitration process will have been thwarted.

Ke did not

12 in essence bargain for an indefinite expansion of his
13 liability, which brings us specifically to the facts of
14 this case, which are unusual in. the many district court,
15 circuit court cases that have developed since Vaca
16 versus Sipes.
17

This case does come to the Court with sound

18 underpinning as to when an arbitration award would have
19 been rendered that would have returned this employee to

20 his employment, and the trial court below made the
21 specific finding that the employer should bear the back

22 wage responsibility, some $17,000, from the time of
23 termination until the time that an arbitration award

24 would have returned him to his employment, and that
25 subsequent to that time, until there was a judicial

1 holding or until there was a jury finding that he should
2 be returned to work, this period of time having
3 occurred, and this loss of wage having occurred because
4 of the union's reckless, as the jury found, malicious,
5 callous disregard of Bowen's rights to taka his case to
6 arbitration, that that period of time was the union's
7 responsibility, and some $30,000 in wages were assessed
8 against the APWU on that basis.

The appellee attempts to

MR. POFF*

1

I suppose that at root we do not,

2 Your Honor, despite our interest perhaps in the law in

3 this area.

However, we ace, as you know, confronted

4 with a Fourth Circuit holding that because we did not
5 note cross appeal from the verdict below, which we deem
6 to be totally favorable, and did not see any need to

7 cross appeal from, because of that and because of a
8 footnote that was added to this decision some four
9 months after the
10 favor,

initial decision was rendered in our

we did not think we would be here in this

11 posture.

The footnote brought us hare because it took

12 away the $30,000 of

the Postal Workers Union's damages

13 that would otherwise have been paid by the Postal
14 Service by saying they would not disturb the trial
15 court's apportionment of some $22,964.12 to the Postal
16 Service because we had not noted an appeal as to that.
17

So, for that reason, it is a matter of some

18 considerable concern to us.
19

QUESTION*

This is your alternative argument.

20

MR. P0FF*

It is — yes.

21

QUESTION*

It may be your stronger one.

I

22 don't know.

23

MR. P0FF*

Well, sir, I think that our point

24 with regard to the actions of the Fourth Circuit in
25 belatedly amending its decision to take $30,000 away

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 from us is one that has been adequately briefed, and I
2 do not desire to discuss that at any great length with
3 the Court.

We do, however, certainly take the position

4 that if the APWU is excused from paying any share of
5 lost wages suffered by Bowen, that he does remain
6 entitled to a full compensatory award from the Postal
7 Service.
8

The Smith versus Evening News analysis which

9 the union engages in apparently in an effort to reach
10 the result that no back wages should be awarded against
11 the union in any unfair representation case except one
12 perhaps where they conspire initially with the employer,
13 it seems to us inapposite because, first of all. Smith
14 was not an unfair representation case.

It did not

15 involve a case with a grievance and arbitration
16 procedure, and as this Court suggested last term in
17 United Parcel Service versus Mitchell, in which you held
18 — we are dealing with a statute of limitations question
19 with a Section

20

301 case.

You in language in that case point out that it

21 is not appropriate to analyze this kind of case on a
22 pure breach of contract theory, because once you get the
23 tripartite hybrid procedure of employer, employee, and
24 union, in a Section 301 setting, with the threshold
25 question being whether there has been a breach of the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

duty of fair representation by the union, that it is not

2 a true breach of contract case any longer, that it is a,
3

I believe, in the words of this Court, a creature of

4

labor law, and so we think that for these reasons, that

5

the rationale of the APWU in its brief is fallacious and

6 fla wed.
7

I would like, if Your Honors please, to

8 reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal purposes.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGESi

Very well.

Ns. Etkind?
ORAL ARGUMENT.OF BARBARA E. ETKIND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL RESPONDENT SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MS. ETKIND:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

14

may it please the Court, the right of an employer to

15

rely on the union to bring any breach by it to its

16

attention within the context of the grievance process so

17

that the employer can rectify its wrong and prevent the

18

accrual of additional damages is inherent in the

19

collective bargaining system.

20
21

As this Court freguently has recognized, a
collective bargaining agreement that contains a

22 grievance arbitration provision is far more than an
23

ordinary contract.

The grievance process itself defines

24

the rights under the collective bargaining agreement.

25

It is the vehicle by which meaning and content are given

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to that agreement.

Indeed, the Court has described the

2 grievance procedure as part of the ongoing collective
3
4
5

bargaining process between the union and the employer.
Accordingly, an act that may be an apparent
violation of the contractual provisions is not a breach

6 of them until it is determined to be such within the
7

context of the grievance machinery.

If it is at that

8 point liability will be assessed to the breaching party
9

who took the action that it did with the full knowledge

10

that its conduct might subsequently in the grievance

11

process be found to constitute a breach.

12

QUESTION;

Well, Ms. Etkind, do I gather from

13

your statement that the government views the kind of

14

liability that an employer and a union would incur in

15

this situation as more or less a kind of joint liability

16

for pretty much the same act?

17

MS. ETKINDs

No.

No, indeed.

The employer

18

would be liable for breach of the collective bargaining

19

agreement, while the union is going to be liable for the

20 breach of the duty of fair representation.
21

Our argument

is that at the point at which the — if the union had

22 not breached its duty, and the employer would have been
23

reinstated, at that point his damages would cease

24

accruing, so that if they continued to accrue —

25

QUESTION;

Well, why should that be?

14

1

Supposing that I am employed by the Unite! States, and I

2 think the United States has fired me wrongly, and I hire
3

a lawyer, and the lawyer eventually tries to get me

4

reinstated but doesn't succeed, and then I go to another

5

lawyer, and that lawyer succeeds in getting me

6 reinstated three or four years later.
7

Now, certainly

the employer is liable all during that period.

Now, I

10

of my wages.
dS. ETKIND:

11

12

He isn’t obligated to pay me part

But the union is in a very

different position than the attorney.

13

QUESTION:

Nell, why?

14

MS. ETKIND:

Because the union is part —

15

there is a tripartite relationship among the union and

16

the employer and the employee, and the union itself owes

17

a duty to prevent the continuation of this wrong.

18

because the union and the employer are parties to the

19

contract.

It is

They are the only parties to the contract.

20 They are the ones that define what the contract means.
21

So that if the union, because of its breach, because of

22 its breach of the duty of fair representation, is in
23

effect saying there is no breach of this agreement, then

24

the employer is entitled to rely on that, and to go on

25

from there.

MS. ETKIND;

It is — it isn't —

Well, no, because he would have

QUESTION;

Well, he comes back and says, I

Well, he proves it.

In that case, the employer should

QUESTION;

You are really speaking of an

3 intervening cause.
4

KS. ETKINDi

In the language of torts, it

5 would be a superseding cause, I believe.

That's right.

6 And that is because — and that is because it doesn’t
7 arise out of tort.

It arises out of the national labor

8 policy, which is that rights are only defined within the
9 grievance procedure.

A collective bargaining agreement

10 itself may be violated, but the breach itself isn't
11 determined until it is within -- within the grievance
12 process.
13

In Hines, Justice Stewart stated in his

14 concurring opinion that once a grievance process is
15 exhausted, the employer’s failure to reinstate
16 discharged employees cannot be anything but rightful
17 until there is a contrary determination.

There is no

18 difference in result whether, as in Hines, an abrital
19 award is rendered in favor of the employer, or until the
20 time for processing the grievance has expired.
21

So the point is that there is no breach of the

22 collective bargaining agreement unless such a breach is
23 found in the context of the grievance process.

In other

24 words, the unique feature of the grievance arbitration
25 process, the fact that it is the vehicle for the

20

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

determination of the substantive rights under the

2 collective bargaining agreement distinguishes an action
3

on a collective bargaining agreement containing such a

4

provision from suit on an ordinary contract.
In the latter case, damages continue to accrue

5

6

up to the time of trial, because it is only at trial

7

that the rights of the parties are determined.

Ey

8 contrast, where a grievance procedure is available to
9

the parties, their rights can be determined

10

substantially earlier, so that all parties can conform

11

their conduct to that determination.
Accordingly, where because of the union's

12

13

wrongs the employer's breach is not brought to its

14

attention in the context of the grievance procedure, it

15

is only fair that the union bear those additional

16

damages that flow from the malfunctioning of the

17

grievance machinery which it caused.

18

2UESTI0N:

How many joined Justice Stewart in

2 his observations?

3

MS. ETKIND:

4

The union argues that imposing liability on it

Justice Stewart was alone.

5 for lost wages will have a chilling effect on the
6 exercise of its discretion to settle employee grievances

7 short of arbitration.

In the first place, a rule that

8 imposes liability on an employer for these damages may

9 chill its right to discharge employees whom the
10

collective bargaining agreement would entitle it to

11

dismiss, thus modifying the parties' rights under the

12 collective bargaining agreement.

13

In any event, the union's contention that the

14 apportionment rule we urge would force it to arbitrate
15 even frivolous grievances for fear that if it did not,
16 it might be assessed back wages, is unfounded.

In Vaca,

17 the Court made clear that a union can breach its duty of
18 fair representation only by conduct that is arbitrary,
19 discriminatory, or in bad faith.
20
21

For example, here the jury found that the
union had acted maliciously, recklessly, or in callous

22 disregard of petitioner's rights.

In our view, that

23 sort of conduct should be chilled, and moreover,
24 whatever —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ASHER W. SCHWARTZ, ESQ.,

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNION

15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

16 please the Court, I have heard a few remarks here which
17 I would like to reply to, but before I do, I would like
18 to urge upon the Court my original presentation, namely
19 that the only violation upon which the claimant, the
20 grievant rests his claim for back wages is the violation
21

of the employment contract, and the only party that

22 violated that contract was the employer, not the union.
23 The union committed no violation of the contract in any
24 respect.

The only violation that we are confronted with

25 with respect to the union is that it violated its duty

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to the employee in its requirement that it represent him

2 fairly.
3

QUESTION*

In the whole scheme of things, do

4 you think that an employer has no interest in whether a
5 union carries out its obligations to employees who are
6 members of that union?
7

HR. SCHWARTZ;

Oh, I think an employer does

8 have an interest, yes, sir.

I agree.

And that interest

9 should have been -10

QUESTION;

That is the whole scheme of the

11 system of labor relations, is it not?
12

MR. SCHWARTZ;

Yes, sir, and that employer in

13 this particular case and in every case makes a decision
14 to discharge an employee for just cause, and through
15 three steps

of the grievance machinery, the employer

16 persists in that decision.

Then the union in this

17 particular case agrees with

the employer.

He says, you

18 have convinced us that this employee has violated his
19 duty to the

20

employer, and he is subject to discharge.

Now, the employer and the union in that case

21 have applied the grievance machinery, have decided in
22 their judgment, which turns out to have been a wrong
23 judgment, decided later on by a jury, that the employee
24 was justly discharged.
25 union be held

Now the question is, shall the

liable because it agreed with the employer

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the employee was justly discharged, a decision

2 which they did not come to until a jury later on
3

determined that there was a breach of the duty of fair

4

representation .
Sow, I think that the union does have an

5

6 interest — the employer does have an interest, and that
7

the interest of the employer is at all times, especially

8 since Vaca, to make sure that it has discharged the
9

employee if it is a discharge only for just cause.

I do

10

not think that the intervening damage or the intervening

11

act or wrongdoing of the union, a wrong committed

12

against the employee, not against the employer, should
1

13

in any way absolve the employer from his wrongdoing.

14

It is just as if a culprit who was slashing

15

away at his victim states that but for the failure of

16

the police to intervene in a timely manner, his knife

17

would not have reached the throat of the victim, and

18

therefore the police are responsible for any of the

19

responsibility beyond the time when they should have

20 been there and the culprit is liable only for mayhem.

Now, that principle is clear in the law of

21

22 torts, and there is no reason — and the law of trusts,
23

and there is no reason why it shouldn't be applicable

24

here.

As Prosser stated it, where one tort feasor by

4

QUESTION:

Counsel, in view of the fact that

5 the employer’s breach is a contractual one, do you think
6 a tort doctrine is necessarily applicable?
7

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I do in this case, because what

8 we are talking about is a classification of the union’s
9 wrong as a tort.

Some people treat that as a tort.

10 Some treat it as a breach of trust.
11 malpractice.

Some treat it as

And that is what we are talking about.

12 are talking about the wrong of the union.

We

Now, the

13 employer has violated the contract, and caused damage to
14 the employee.
15

QUESTION:

I thought Prosser’s example dealt

16 with two tort feasors and the allocation of liability
17 between them.

Certainly the employer here is not a tort

18 feasor.
19

SR. SCHWARTZ:

No, the employer breached the

20 contract and caused the damage by that breach, and it is
21 the only party that broke the contract, but I don’t

22 think that there should be any distinction in logic
23 between the two situations.

Why should the wrongdoing

24 of the union to the employee be a benefit to the
25 employer and not to the employee?

For instance; in contract law, you

I do, and I think that as

the damages to the employee is

12 that ha has been out of a job from the date of his

13 discharge until the date of his reinstatement, and that
14 is caused by the breach of contract, and only by the
15 breach of contract.

The only reason I bring the tort

16 analogy in is because the employer in this case is
17 attempting to relieve himself of some of those damages
18 by resorting to a tort or a breach of duty by the union
19 to the employee, and there is no reason for doing so.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

MR. SCHWARTZi

No, I don't assume that the

I assume that the

5 therefore there should have been an arbitration on the
6 case, yes.
7

QUESTION;

And if there had been, and if there

What is really being said here

25 is that the union should in some way indemnify the

1 employer for the period of time when the union might
2 have taken the case to arbitration, and didn't in breach
3 of its duty to fair representation, but there is no
4 agreement in the contract that there should be an
5 indemnification.

There is no agreement in the contract

6 that the union will take the case to arbitration.
7

QUESTIONS

Kay I ask this question?

Justice

8 White asked earlier if the union has any duty to the
9 employer to be diligent and faithful in its obligation
10 of fair representation of the employee.

Do you say it

11 has no duty to the employer?
12

KR. SCHWARTZ*

Well, I don't say that it has

13 no duty. Your Honor, but I say that the only duty it has
14 is to make a decision as to whether or not it will or
15 will not take the case to arbitration.
16

QUESTION*

Now, that —

Does it have a duty to act in good

17 faith, and does that duty run to the employer?
18

MR. SCHWARTZ*

I think it does have a duty to

19 act in good faith, but it is not a duty to the
20 employer.
21

It is a duty to the employee.
QUESTION*

But does not the employer have an

22 interest in having that duty performed properly?

It

23 would seem to me that if you say there is no obligation
24 at all to the employer, that then in subsequent
25 litigation the union would always come in and say, well,

QUESTION:

10

Excuse me, sir.

Mr. Schwartz, if the union

11

deliberately, as somebody has suggested, in bad faith

prolonged the arbitration proceedings, say, for five

13 years, are you suggesting the responsibility would be on
14 the employer to pay the back wages for the entire period
15 with no responsibility on the union?

That is your

16 position ?
17

MR. SCHWARTZ:

extended the —

19 affirmatively took action which

extended the period of

20 time during which the employee is out of work, that —

Even if he extended it for five

HR. SCWHARTZ :

Well, if it is only doing it

8 consider that to be a very

rare and very hypothetical

9 situation which I can hardly contemplate.
10 think the employer
11

I should

could find relief against that in

some other way.

12

QUESTION:

For example?

13

MR. SCWHARTZ:

Well, it could go into court

14 and say, look, this union is not acting in good faith,
15 and for that reason I want this proceeding to be halted,
16 to obtain a restraining order, at least to show that
17 there is a violation of the union's duty to proceed with
18 the arbitration.

There is a duty under the contract to

T9 proceed with the arbitration machinery.
20

QUESTION:

Is that duty breached in this

21 case?

22

HR. SCHWARTZ:

No — well, the duty here was

23 the duty not to initiate the grievance machinery, which
24 is no different -- I wouldn't say it was no different,
25 but it is equivalent to the duty of the employer not to

process, to preserve labor harmony and peace?

a duty or interest, I don't know, but it has a definite

22 interest in it, but I don't think that that duty to the
23

employer, if broken, and we will assume a breach, means

24

that the union now has to pay the damages for which the

25

I say that there are other damages that it

3 will have to bear, but not that.
4

QUESTION*

Well, do you think, that when the

5 union deciles not to go to arbitration, ani let’s assume
6 that that is an arbitrary decision, and it is a breach
7 of duty to the employee, do you think when the union
8 acts in that way, that at the very same time it is
9 breaching a duty to the employer?
10

MR. SCHWARTZ*

11

QUESTION*

No, I do not.

He hasn’t got any duty to the

12 employer to take the case to arbitration.
13

MR. SCHWARTZ*

14 that, yes.
15

Exactly.

That’s right.

I say

He does not have that obligation.
QUESTION*

So the breach of duty to the

16 employee is not necessarily a breach of duty to the
17 employer.

18

MR. SCHWARTZ*

That's right.

The only thing

19 is that I agree with

the Chief Justice.

20

That if you do take it to

QUESTION*

21 arbitration,

22

you have a duty to do so in good faith.

MR. SCHWARTZ*

23 accordance with

That you have to act in

the machinery that is provided for in

24 the contract, in good faith, but there is no duty to
25 take the — any case, so far as the employer is

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 concerned, to arbitration.
2

QUESTION*

Then you are bifurcating this duty,

3 however you define it.

You are now saying that there is

4 no duty to go to arbitration, but there is a duty that
5 if they go to arbitration, it must be conducted in good
6 faith.

How do you really separate those two things?

7

SR. SCWHARTZ:

8

QUESTION*

Well —

The one is just — it is a

9 continuous stream, is it not?
10

HR. SCHWARTZ*

11

QUESTION;

No, sir.

I think that I can --

To preserve labor harmony.

That is

12 the purpose of the arbitration clause, isn’t it?
13

HR. SCHWARTZ:

That’s right.

14 can differentiate it. Your Honor.

Yes.

I think I

I think that when a

15 union considers an action taken by the employer which it
16 believes to be a violation of the contract, it has to
17 make a decision, shall it take that case to arbitration
18 or not, and it has to make that decision in the manner
19 provided for in the agreement.

Now, the agreement

20 doesn’t say that the union must take it to arbitration.
21 There is no agreement that I know of that indicates
22 anything of that sort.
23 is not satisfied with

All it says is that if the union
the resolution of the dispute in

24 the grievance machinery,

25

it may appeal to an arbitrator.

Now, its consideration of the case, its

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 investigation of the case ought to be done fairly.
2 Whether that is an obligation to the employer or not, I
3 am not so sure.

I think that those things are basically

4 obligations to the employee whom the union represents.
5 The only obligation which I, in response to your
6 question, will admit to so far as the employer is
7 concerned is that it use — it apply the administrative
8 machinery procedurally in a proper way, and not take
9 advantage of failings by the employer in procedure or
10 anything of that sort.

That is what I would mean by

11 acting in good faith in connection with the grievance
12 procedure.
13

QUESTION:

Did you try the case?

14

HR. SCHWARTZ:

15

QUESTION:

No, sir, I did not.

I just wondered about the

16 instructions to the jury.
17

HR. SCHWARTZ:

The jury was instructed, as I

18 recall it -- I don't have them before me — that it
19 would first have to determine whether there was a breach

20 of the duty of fair representation.
21

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

22

HR. SCHWARTZ:

And then, if it found that,

23 then it would then determine whether there was a
24 violation of the agreement, and of course the court used
25 the usual language that has become prevalent in these

2 discriminatory, arbitrary.

25 being charged with duty of

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it would watch out for itself in the instructions to the

2 jury as to what kind of damages the jury is authorized
3

to find.

If the jury is — If the court had expressly

authorized the jury to divide up the liability for back

pay, which apparently it did, it seems to me the union

6 would — you, certainly, based

on what you say here,

would be up on your hind legs immediately.
MR. SCHWARTZ;

I should think so. Your Honor.

As a matter of fact, our brief shows that the trial

boils down, I gather, to a question of the law of

and it is your position, as I understand it,

can never be liable, just focusing on its

a loss of pay.

Is that your position?

Well, let's suppose the fact finder

that the employer initially made a wrongful

discharge, but that if the union had exercised its right

12 to compel arbitration,
13 back

that the employee would have gone

to. work on Date Y, and that as a result, the

14 employee has bean damaged thereafter to the

liable as a

Yes.

Yes, Your Honor, and that

This is a case just like that.

It certainly is.

I find it hard to

21 understand why applying normal damages principles you

22 can take that view, assuming the fact-finder makes the
23 appropriate determination.
24

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Because I don't think that the

the union, albeit a wrongful act, should inure

SR. SCHWARTZ;

That they recover double?

Yes,

I do, unless the court is going to impose punitive

20 damages, which this Court has already decided are not
21

appropriate, but the employee, so far as the breach of

22 contract is concerned, is entitled to be made whole
23

under the law of contract damages, and he is made whole

if the employer pays his back pay in full.

The only thing that results from assessing the

It is the employer who then gets a

2 the employer can't pay?
HR. SCHWARTZ:

3

Well, I think that's possible.

4 I don't know the answer to that, but I think it is
5 possible.

If in that case the employee cannot be made

6 whole by an action against the employer, then I think we
7 would have to consider whether or not the damages have

1 said that there’s no reason why it can't be because the
2 union would only be liable for the damages that it
3 caused by its breach of duty of fair representation and
4 not by the damages caused by the violation of the
5 contract.
6

2UESTI0N:

Early in your argument, Mr.

7 Schwartz, I understood you to say that it was proper to
8 have — I think you used the phrase something like "all
9 one ball of wax," that both these parties should be sued
10 in one suit and that there should be allocation.
11

Sow, did I misunderstand you?

12

MR. SCHWARTZi

13 Sipes said that.

No.

And I think Vaca against

But what I*m talking about is what

14 should the allocation be.

I think that it’s proper for

15 the two claims to be brought in one suit rather than to
16 have two separate suits.

But the allocation is the

17 question that’s before this Court, ani I don’t think
18 that the union — the allocation should be to require
19 the union to pay for the wrong done by the employer by
20 its violation of contract, and that’s all.
21

The union did cause some damage to the

22 employee by requiring him to go to court, retain counsel
23 and suffer whatever costs there were in pursuing his
24 claim; but those are the only damages for which the
25 union should be held responsible.

47

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, I'd like to before — I only have a

2 minute, but I'd like to point out that holding the union
3

back pay will be a considerable hardship to the union.

4

This Court has considered that in previous cases.

5

that the result may well be that a union would prefer

And

6 and would find it more economical to take all cases to
7

arbitration rather than risk the possibility that some

8 jury is going to second guess it and decide that it
9

breached its duty of fair representation.

And that is

10

not what the grievance machinery is supposed to

11

accomplish.

12

Finally, these cases have so proliferated

13

already that insurance companies are approaching us.

14

I've received since my name appeared on the brief, I've

courts generally are the odd cases, and in most cases

19

are situations in which there's been a hindsight

20 judgment made by a jury that’s sympathetic in almost all

cases to the plight of the employee, and in order to

22 give that employee relief, it has to find that the union

violated its duty of fair representation.

Well, you'd — I supposed you'd

namely when he's sued, he says well, you didn't follow

to arbitration, and hence, the grievance ended the whole

Isn't it —

QUESTION;

7

Well, there'd have to be a new

8 trial because it was a jury case.
9

MR. POFF;

That is correct.

10

QUESTION;

And the stated remedy is still

11

available, is it not?

12

MR. POFF;

I beg your pardon, sir.

13

QUESTION;

That remedy is still available as a

14

result of this case.

15

MR. POFF;

Yes, I think it would be.

16

QUESTION;

I suppose we would have the

17

authority —

18

MR. POFF;

That's our second point.

19

QUESTION;

— To say that the Court of Appeals

20 was wrong in what it did, that it should have ordered a
21

new trial.

22

MR. POFF;

Yes, sir.

23

QUESTION;

Mr. Poff, do you think the union is

24

obliged to go to arbitration?

25

MR. POFF;

Do I think it is obliged to go to

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

MR. POFFi

I think that in this case it

QUESTION:

MR. P3FF:

But it depends on each case.
It does indeed, sir.

Whether they

8 need to go in order to fulfill their duty of fair
9 representation.

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

11

MR. POFF:

And I — in this case it was

12 that they did have that obligation.

held

I don't think there

13 is any — I think they have —
14

QUESTION:

So you don't have to go to the

15 general one at all.
16

MR. POFF:

Do not have to go to what, sir?

17

QUESTION:

You don't have to go to the

18 general, that in all cases they have to go to
19 arbitration.
20

MR. POFF:

Oh, no.

No, no, no, indeed, sir.

21 And I think, in fact, that the place to -- as has been
22 suggested by Justice Rehnquist, the place to police the
23 duty of unfair representation, which is going to be a
24 very fragile duty indeed if you accept the union's
25 position in this case because there's no sanction.

10

MR. POFF;

They haven't paid them yet, sir.

11

(Laughter. )

12

QUESTION;

Well, part of the judgment — part

13 of the judgment is that they must pay part of

them.

14

MR. POFF;

Part of them at least.

15

I would suggest, though, that a proper

16 policing of the arbitrary bad faith standard is the
17 place to control the unfair
18 the

representation cases, not in

— and to end the area of an appropriate allocation

19 of damages.

Because here we have a union that

20 concededly is responsible for £30,000 worth of Mr.
21 Bowen's lost wages and

the union contending that it has

22 no responsibility for those.
