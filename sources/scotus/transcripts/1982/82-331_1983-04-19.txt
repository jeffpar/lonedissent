ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. DUNIGAN, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. DUNIGANs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
The issue in this case plainly stated is

12

simply does the State of New Mexico have the authority

13

concurrent with the Mescalero Apache Tribe to regulate

14

hunting and fishing by non-Indians on the Mescalero

15

Apache reservation.

16

The history suggests that it does.

Since New Mexico became a state in

1912, it

17

has had fish and game laws in a state-wide wildlife

18

conservation program.

19

laws to non-Indians hunting and fishing within all areas

20

of the state during this period of time.

21

It has applied its game and fish

For approximately the last 15 years since the

22

Mescalero Apache Tribe has allowed public hunting on its

23

reservation, the State of New Mexico has applied its

24

game and fish laws to non-Indians who have hunted or

25

fished on that reservation as it has with respect to

v

1

each of the other 26 Indian reservations or enclaves

2

located in the State of New Mexico.

3

of time the state has not only enforced its wildlife

4

regulations, but the wildlife on Indian lands has

5

benefitted from the full range of conservation

6

programming that the state has provided over time on a

7

state-wide basis.

During this period

8

In 1977, however, the Mescalero Apache Tribe

9

passed a hunting and fishing ordinance which specified

10

in part that a state hunting and fishing license would

11

no longer be required of any person hunting or fishing

12

on the Mescalero Apache reservation.

13

the Mescalero Tribe had acknowledged in its hunting and

14

fishing brochures that state game and fish licensing

15

regulations and the entire state game and fish wildlife

16

regulation did apply to non-Indians hunting or fishing

17

on the Mescalero Apache reservation.

18

Up until that time

The passage of the new ordinance in 1977

19

followed soon after the opening by the tribe of the Inn

20

of the Mountain Gods on the reservation.

21

Mountain Gods is a deluxe tourist resort featuring a

22

hotel, a lake for fishing, boating and water sports, a

23

golf course, tennis facilities, shooting range, a

24

stable, and various other tourist and convention-related

25

recrecational facilities and activities.

The Inn was opened by the Mascalero Apache

Tribe as part of a tourism program organized by the

tribe and intended to attract non-Indians onto the

reservation and to the Sierra Blanca ski resort, which

is a tribal commercial enterprise located adjacent to

the reservation.

10

Package hunts include hunting fees, lodging at

the Inn of the Mountain Gods, guide service and various

12

other hunter needs.

13

QUESTION:

Well, would it make any difference,

14

Mr. Dunnigan, how much of the activity the Mescaleros

15

were engaged in, whether it was one resort or a great

16

many, a small amount or a great deal of this hunting?

17

MR. DUNIGAN:

No, Your Honor,

I don’t think

18

that the amount or the size of the commercial enterprise

1

of the tribe has any jurisdictional significance.

20

QUESTION:

How do you distinguish it from the

21

logging operations, for example?

22

MR. DUNIGAN:

Well, Your Honor, the logging

23

operations were conducted by non-Indian companies

24

together with Indian enterprises.

25

QUESTION:

The Indians could have done it all

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

on their own if they wanted, had they had the equipment

2

and the personnel.
MR. DUNIGAN:

3

Yes, Your Honor, I presume that

4

is true.

In that respect there is no difference between

5

the cases.

6

the federal regulatory scheme that applied in that case,

7

in the White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker case to

8

which you refer as opposed to the one that applies in

9

this case.

There is a difference, though, in terms of

For that reason, the cases are

10

distinguishable, not because there is a difference in

11

the commercial enterprise at stake.

12

QUESTION

Mr. Dunnigan.

13

MR. DUHIGANs

14

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

The Court in Montana v. United

15

States, of course, recognized that an Indian tribe can

16

prohibit non-members from hunting and fishing on the

17

reservation or can allow them and condition that permit

18

as the tribe determines..

19

New Mexico is asking for here with that case because it

20

would seem that if the tribe has a right to condition

21

the hunting and fishing as described in Montana, that

22

the right would be meaningless if a state were allowed

23

to apply inconsistent regulations.

24
25

MR. DUNIGAN:

Now how do you reconcile what

Your Honor, I recognize that the

Montana case articulates the principles you have

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

described, and we do not argue that the Mescalero Apache

2

Tribe does not have the right to admit hunters or

3

fisherman if it desires or preclude hunting and fishing

4

if it desires.

5

conditions for hunting and fishing if it so decides.

It can also establish terms and

6

The Montana case certainly permits that.

7

the Montana case did not suggest that when a tribe

8

enjoys this authority over non-Indian visitors on its

9

reservation, that that authority is exclusive of state

10
11

But

authority which normally applies to non-Indians.
QUESTION;

But they could be totally

12

inconsistent.

For instance, I do not know what the

13

circumstances are here, but a tribe might develop the

14

game to such an extent that it can offer people a chance

15

to take five elk whereas the New Mexico requirements

16

might permit someone to take only one, and the two would

17

be quite inconsistent.

18

MR. DUNIGAN;

Your Honor, you suggest an

19

extreme case, which is not a part of the factual

20

situation here, but I acknowledge that, built in to a

21

system of concurrent jurisdiction is the possibility of

22

conflicts arising between the two sets of laws.

23

Our position is that the State of New Mexico

24

as a sovereign continues to have the authority to apply

25

its laws to non-Indians who are not immune from those

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

laws as Indians are and that a reservation does not

2

provide that immunity to a non-Indian unless that

3

non-Indian can claim that he, too, is excused from

4

obeying state law because there is a federal law that

5

preempts those state laws that he has to abide by

6

instead, or that his relationship with the tribe

7

concerns a matter of the internal governmental relations

8

of the tribe and for that reason tribal law alone

9

controls.

10

But under normal circumstances as the cases

11

that this Court has decided suggests that the normal

12

circumstance is concurrent jurisdiction in those

13

situations when a tribe does enjoy jurisdiction over

14

non-Indians, which is not always the case.

15

The importance of the Montana case to this

16

case, in fact, is the statement in that case that as a

17

general proposition, and those are the words of this

18

Court, as a general proposition the inherent sovereign

19

authority of an Indian tribe does not extend to

20

non-Indians.

21

That is the normal proposition.

The Court did articulate and identify

22

circumstances in which an Indian tribe may regulate

23

activities of non-members.

24

a tribe may regulate through taxation, licensing and

25

other means the activities of non-members who enter into

In fact, the Court said that

8

1

consensual relationships with the tribe through

2

commercial dealings, contracts, leases, and the like.

3

And that may very well be the case here.

4

QUESTIONi

But —

Mr. Dunnigan, perhaps I am

5

mistaken, but I thought the record does disclose

6

conflicts between the state system and the tribal system

7

particularly as to the taking of deer, that does may not

8

be taken under the state regulations, but under the

9

tribal ones a buck and a doe could be taken.

10

mistaken?
MR. DUNIGAN*

11

12

Your Honor, no, you are quite

correct.
QUESTION*

13
14

So we do have some very definite

conflicts as Justice O’Connor indicated?
MR. DUNIGAN*

15

Your Honor, we do have

16

conflicts.

17

Justice O'Connor identified or any one quite that

18

dramatic, but we do have conflicts in the regulations.

19

There is no question about that.

20

this case would not have arisen.

21

We do not have the particular one that

If we had not, perhaps

But I am not suggesting. Your Honor, and I did

22

not mean to leave the impression that there are no

23

conflicts in those laws.

24

recognize the potential for others.

25

however, is that the state nevertheless enjoys the right

We recognize that and we

it has as a sovereign to apply its laws to non-members

2

of an Indian tribe unless, again, those laws under the

3

decisions of this Court have been preempted by a federal

4

regulatory scheme or that the sovereign powers of the

5

tribe with reference to the governing of its own members

6

and their internal affairs would be disrupted and

7

frustrated in a given instance.

QUESTIONi

Well, as I understand your

position, you want the state regulation uniformly
applied to non-Indians all across the state.
MR. DUNIGAN*

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is our position.
QUESTION*

And that there should not be an

14

exception of a cuna so to speak for the Mescalero

15

reservation?

16

MR. DUNIGANs

That is correct. Your Honor, or

17

for any one of the other 26 Indian reservations or

18

enclaves located in New Mexico which together comprise

19

over 7 million acres of land and 11,000 square miles,

20

approximately 10 percent of the land area of the State

21

of New Mexico and located in virtually every region or

22

part of the state.

23

QUESTION;

Mr. Dunnigan, it seems to me there

24

might be two different types of problems.

One is the

25

substantive regulation as to how many animals of

10

in having the right to license people to hunt within the

reservation?

ME. DUNIGAN;

What is the state interest

Your Honor, that is in our

statement —
QUESTION;

If they had their own licensing

system, which I guess they do.
MR. DUNIGAN;
QUESTION;

I am sorry. Your Honor?

Assuming the Indians have their own

licensing system which I guess they do.
MR. DUNIGAN;

Yes, Your Honor, they do.

The

13

interest of the state in licensing per se is that the

14

licensing permit system is an essential part of the

15

overall conservation program of the state.

16

licensing mechanism, the state is able to control the

17

harvest, is able to ascertain also the success ratio of

18

particular hunting seasons and in particular areas, and

19

for that reason, the licensing system in the judgment of

20

the Department of Game ani Fish of the state is an

21

essential ingredient in the overall conservation program

22

of the state as well as are the substantive regulations

23

pertaining to the season dates, bag limits, and the like.

24
25

QUESTION;

Through the

Am I in error that it is agreed

that the Indian licensing procedure is a good one?

indicate that at the present time the ordinances of the

6

tribe maintain a sufficient wildlife population on the

7

reservation to be consistent with wholesome conservation

8

circumstances.
QUESTION*

10

So, where does the state get this

additional interest?
MR. DUNIGANi

11
12

The record does

Well, the state’s interest, Your

Honor, is —

13

Its interest is that they do it —

14

Their signatures on there are better than the Indian’s

signature on the license?

17

to do with whether one licensing system is better than

18

another.

New Mexico is not a Public Law

Where does New Mexico get it from?

within its borders.

12

QUESTION!

3
4

My question was where did you get

it?
MR. DUNIGANi

Our authority over non-Indians,

5

Your Honor, stems from the fact that New Mexico is one

6

of the 50 sovereign states of the union and was admitted

7

to the union on equal protection with other states who

8

have the authority within their borders even on Indian

9

land to apply their laws to non-Indians unless, again.

20

those laws have been preempted by a superior

21

congressional enactment and scheme of regulation or

22

unless in a particular situation the non-Indian is

23

acting in relationship to the tribe so that the internal

24

governmental affairs and social relations of the tribe

25

are intimately involved in that situation.

reinstated its original decision and dismissed this

Court's decision in the Montana case as essentially

irrelevant to a decision in this case.

19

Circuit sought to explain its decision in that regard by

suggesting that the Montana case involved non-Indian fee

lands within the Crow reservation and the guestion of

22

whether a tribe, being the Crow tribe in that case,

23

could impose or regulate non-Indian hunting and fishing

24

on those non-Indian fee lands whereas this case involves

tribal trust lands within a reservation and the

fact, exist between these two cases, but that much was

5

evident when this Court originally remanded this case

6

back to the Tenth Circuit in the first place.

7

despite these factual differences, the Montana case

8

remains crucial to this case because of one of its

9

underlying principles.

10

So

The Montana case, as I indicated earlier,

11

stated, as had this Court in Oliphant v. Suguamish

12

Indian Tribe and Wheeler v. United States, that as a

3

general proposition the inherent authority of a tribe

4

does not extend to non-Indians.

Montana case was not that non-Indian fee lands were

involved but that non-Indians were involved.

is a right of the tribe to regulate the hunting and

fishing on the reservation as to non-members.

25

MR. DUNIGAN;

Your Honor, we recognize that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

1165 provides a criminal trespass penalty, a federal

2

criminal trespass penalty to be imposed upon a person

3

who enters a reservation without the permission of the

4

tribe for purposes of hunting or fishing.

5

regulate the conduct of a person on the reservation in

6

terms of his hunting and fishing activity.

It does not

It does not recognize, Your Honor, as you

suggest that the tribe has the authority to impose

9

regulations that would oust state law if that was the

10

Justice’s suggest.
QOESTIONj

11

i

Well, certainly the statute unlike,

12

for example, the liquor statute, it does not indicate

13

that the hunting and fishing has to be done in

14

conformity with the laws of the state.

15

absent from this hunting and fishing statute.

16

that so?

17

HR. DUNIGANs

That language is
Isn't

That is correct, Your Honor.

18

The penalty imposed by that statute does not require

19

that a state law be violated before it is implemented.

20

But again it is only a criminal trespass statute as the

21

legislative history clearly suggests.

22

punish anything other than entry without permission, and

23

for that reason it does not provide the comprehensive

24

regulatory scheme with regard to hunting and fishing

25

that was apparent or present in the Bracker case with

It does not

1

reference to the logging and timber operations involved

2

in that case.

3

The problem with the original decision of the

4

Tenth Circuit in this particular case was that it failed

5

to recognize, either in its original decision or on

6

remand, the general proposition which this Court stated

7

in Montana that non-Indians are normally not subject to

8

tribal law.

9

started at the threshold with the observation that in

In fact, it inverted that principle and

10

the area of game and fish regulation the inherent

11

sovereign powers of a tribe extend to non-members and

12

they are exclusive, in the judgment of the Tenth Circuit.

13

In that regard, the Tenth Circuit has

14

fashioned essentially a new rule of law which has no

15

judicial authority to support it whatsoever.

16

certainly squarely in conflict with this Court's

17

judgment in the Montana case as well as many other cases

18

in this Court, one, for example, being Washington v.

19

Fishing Vessels Association which clearly held that an

20

Indian tribe does not have complete dominion over the

21

taking of any species even though it may have a treaty

22

right to hunt and fish free of state regulation.

23

It is

So we have here a situation in which the Tenth

24

Circuit has adopted a position in this case which is

25

virtually synonymous with the position advocated by the

2

case but rejected by this Court to the effect that

3

on-reservation activities affecting a resident tribe

4

should be considered presumptively beyond the reach of

state law by operation of the principle of tribal

6

sovereignty.
So that in that situaton a state would have to

7

8

establish its jurisdiction over non-Indians by pointing

9

to a specific congressional delegation of authority to

10

exercise its power, or it would have to show an

11

essential need to regulate in support of a vital state

interest.

concurrent with tribal law unless again there has been a

20

federal regulatory scheme based upon conressional

21

legislation and implementing regulations which preempt

22

state law and that requires an examination of the

23

particular context to determine if there is such

24

legislation, if there are such regulations and then a

25

particularized inquiry into the nature of the state,

federal, and tribal interests is initiated to determine

2

whether or not in the specific context cf a particular

3

case the exercise of state authority would violate that

4

particular regulatory scheme.
In this case, the Tenth Circuit did embark

5
6

upon that inquiry eventually, choosing not to rest its

7

decision entirely on its novel formulation respecting

8

the exclusive tribal sovereignty over non-Indians where

9

wildlife is concerned.

But the inquiries it made were

10

so distorted by the threshold view that it had adopted

11

that its inquiries really cannot withstand critical

12

examination in light of the authorities articulated by

13

this Court.
For example, in conducting its inquiry with

14
15

regard to preemption, the Tenth Circuit noted that when

16

a state asserts authority over the conduct of

17

non-Indians what is called for is a particularized

18

inquiry into the nature of the various state, federal,

19

and tribal interests at stake.

20

failed to recognize, however, is that before one engages

21

in a particularized inquiry into the nature of the

22

interests at stake, there must be a point of departure,

23

a frame of reference, a context in which to conduct that

24

inquiry.

25

congressional enactment or set of laws and a set of

What the court below

activity in question.

9

On the contrary, unless there is federal

One does not simply view the interests at

10

legislation and implementing regulations, there is no

11

question at all of preemption.

12

White Mountain case this Court considered whether or not

13

the State of Arizona may impose certain taxes on

14

non-Indian logging and timber companies, as we have

15

previously described.

16

this Court said that in that situation the federal

17

government’s regulation of the harvesting of Indian

18

timber is comprehensive.

19

For example, in the

In finding these laws preemptive,

In the words of the Court, that regulation

20

takes the form of acts of Congress, detailed regulations

promulgated by the Secretary of Interior, and day-to-day

22

supervision by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

Ramah case similarly, for example, this Court declared

24

25

non-Indian construction company building a school for

But in that case the Court pointed to the

1974 and the regulations

In that context, this Court found that the
imposition of additional state burdens on that federal

10

regulatory scheme would not be permissible, the state

11

interest being simply raising revenue.

12

preemption analysis begins with an examination of the

13

context in which it arises to determine if there are

14

congressional enactments, laws of the United States, and

15

regulations of the executive branch which establish a

16

federal regulatory scheme with respect to which the

17

state is not permitted to intrude.

18

But again the

Short of that, there is no question of

19

preemption, and state laws prevail with respect to

20

non-Indians on Indian land.

21

With reference to the question of infringement

22

in this case, it is based really upon two points.

23

being the possible financial impairment to the tribe’s

24

revenues as a result of the application of state laws

25

and the claim that implementation of state regulation

With reference to the claim of financial

impairment, factually that has not happened in the

like this is to what extent can an Indian tribe running

from non-Indians, use its ability to grant exemptions

from state laws, for example, sell hunting licenses at

25

cut rate prices.

MR. CLAIBORNEs

Mr. Chief Justice, certainly.

We approach the case on three different bases.

,

1

first as we read the injunction of this Court in the

2

White Mountain Apache case, the test this Court has laid

3

down in judging whether the activity of non-Indians

4

within an Indian reservation is or is not exempted from

5

state law depends on a weighing of the respective

6

interests of the federal government, the state

7

government,

and the Indian government.

8

We have engaged in our brief in that weighing

9

here and find that what is conspicuously lacking is any

10

serious claim of state interest.

There is no allegation

11

that there is a need for state intervention to preserve

12

the species or any other conservation purpose.

13

There is a concession that the tribal activity

14

and the way in which the program is managed is sound and

15

creates no off-reservation harm.

16

which the state asserts is one to manage the wildlife of

17

the entire state in a unit, but that interest is one

18

which cannot prevail for if the tribe, as it is plainly

19

free to do, were to close the reservation to non-Indians

20

and manage the resources for its own benefit, clearly

21

state regulation would not be applicable there.

Does the supervision of the federal

government go to the extent of ascertaining whether or
not their game and fish laws are enforced by the tribe?
MR. CLAIBORNE;

I don’t know that that is so.

Justice Powell, but I must say that here there is no
suggestion -QUESTION;

I understand the facts of this

case, but I have the same interest that other Justices
have expressed.

Your brief states that the ordinances,

having been approved by the Secretay, have the force of
federal law.

If that is so, isn’t that a complete

answer if you are correct with respect to that?

That is

preemption 100 percent, isn't it?
MR. CLAIBORNE*

Well, and that is the aspect

in which this case, though different from White Mountain
Apache, involves an equally pervasive if not more
pervasive scheme of regulation which has the imprimatur
of federal approval and continuing federal monitoring.
QUESTION;

Well, in that case, Mr. Claiborne,

it would have been unnecessary for the Court to refer at
all in White Mountain Apache to the federal statutory
structure if a tribal ordinance which is approved by the
Department of the Interior has the force of federal
preemptive law.

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-9300

I mean a lot of our discussion of these cases
has been quite unnecessary if that is the principle.
MR. CLAIBORNE*

Justice Rehnquist, in White

Mountain Apache so far as I am aware there was no tribal
comprehensive scheme.

In that instance the regulatory

scheme was federal, not tribal, but in other cases as in
Fisher and, indeed, as in Mazurie the Court indicated
that when a tribal law or ordinance is enacted pursuant
to federal authority and with federal approval, it may
have the preemptive effect which the federal regulation
itself was held to have.
QUESTION;

That may be so, but you would still

have to reach the conclusion that state law was entirely
preempted, either that the tribe has occupied the field,
so to speak — just preemption would not mean anything
more than that the state law is preempted to the extent
that it is inconsistent with the tribal ordinance.

It

would not mean that they could not, for example, insist
on a license.
MR. CLAIBORNE;

I invoke the Court’s holdings

in White Mountain Apache and in Ramah Navajo to the
effect that the preemption test with respect to
preemption of state law on Indian reservations is a very
different one.

It is not a matter of preempting only

what is inconsistent.

It is a rule that state law will

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. DUNIGAN, ESQ.

please the Court.
With reference to Justice Powell's inquiry, I
should point out that there is no federal involvement

whatsoever in the enforcement of tribal regulations in
the area of hunting and fishing.
Moreover, tribal regulations, tribal
ordinances themselves even if they are comprehensive
cannot by their own terms oust, or by their own force
oust state law applicable to non-Indians, and this Court
has so held in Washington v. the Confederated Tribes of
the Coville Indian Reservation where the Court said, we
are not going to adopt the far-reaching notion that an
Indian tribe has the authority as the United States
would have to preempt state law merely by enacting a
legislative ordinance that pertains to the same conduct
that state law purports to regulate.
If this were true, if a tribe were able to do
this, then any Indian ordinance passed would — if a
tribe were able to do this simply because the federal
government does approve its ordinances, if that alone
were enough to give it preemptive effect, then any
Indian ordinance of any kind adopted by an Indian tribe
applicable to non-Indians at least would be preemptive
of any state law that applied to the same situation
because as the Solicitor General noted, all Indian
ordinances that apply to non-Indians have to be approved
by the Secretary of the Interior.

If his imprimatur of

that regulation is enough to give the Indian ordinance

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

that whenever an Indian tribe enacts any ordinance
whatsoever state law is preempted.

The question is essentially
