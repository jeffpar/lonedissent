CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Nr. Nabrit, I think you can begin whenever you

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. NABRIT,

III, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. NABRIT:

8
9

We will hear arguments

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, I represent the petitioner, Elwood

10

Barclay, who is hare on a writ of certiorari to review a

11

judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida which on direct

12

appeal affirmed his murder conviction and a death

13

sentence.

14

The death sentence was imposed by a judge of

15

the Circuit Court of Duval County who entered written

16

sentencing findings that are the focus of our argument

17

here today.

18

verdict which recommended that Barclay be given life

19

imprisonment, and the Florida Supreme Court affirmed.

20

Barclay lost by a four-to-two vote, and his rehearing

21

petition was denied by an equally divided court.

22

The judge disregarded an advisory jury

Petitioner brought the case here on

23

certiorari, and the state filed a brief agreeing that

24

this Court should review the case.

25

Now, let me begin my statement of the case

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

before I describe the proceedings in the court below by

2

briefly recounting five points about- the Florida death

3

sentencing statute.

4

this Court before.

5

Proffit case, and it was presented as having five

6

procedural safeguards.

7

It is a statute that has been in
It was the statute approved in the

First, a requirement that the death sentence

8

be based on specific written findings about aggravating

9

circumstances, which was supposed to serve as a guide

10
11

for the sentencer's discretion.
Second, the statute says that the list of

12

aggravating circumstances is limited to eight factors,

13

which are listed in the statute, and six of those I will

14

just refer to in a moment are involved in this case.

15

Second, the statute provided for an automatic

16

appeal, a review in which the Florida Supreme Court is

17

supposed to keep the sentencing decisions under the

18

statute in line with the statute.

19

Next, the jury had a special role.

Although

20

it is called advisory, the jury — the jury's judgment

21

is supposed to prevail under the Florida law unless no

22

reasonable mind could disagree that the death sentence

23

should be imposed, so that it is — and finally, the

24

idea that both the judge and jury will make a judgment

25

both about the sufficiency of the aggravating

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

circumstances to justify a death sentence as well as a

2

weighing of the aggravating and mitigating

3

circumstances.
So, in summary, in the Proffit case, the Court

4
5

said that after a verdict of guilt, there would be what

6

this Court referred to as an informed, focused, guided,

7

and objective inquiry into the question of whether a

8

death sentence should be imposed, and that would be at

9

-- that kind of objective inquiry, at both the trial and

10

appellate levels.
Now, in Barclay's case, Barclay was found

11

12

guilty in March of 1975, along with a co-defendant

13

Dougan.

14

the death of one Stephen Orlando, and two other

15

co-defendants were convicted by the same jury of

16

second-degree murder.

He was found guilty of first-degree murder in

After the conviction, at the penalty trial,

17
18

the jury recommended a death sentence for the

19

co-defendant Dougan, but life imprisonment for Barclay.

20

And in the penalty hearing, the state argued for only

21

one of the eight statutory aggravating circumstances,

22

that the crime was heinous atrocious, and cruel, yet the

23

state made no effort at that penalty trial to convince

24

the jury that any of the other seven circumstances

25

applied.

5
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

And the majority of the jury came back with a

2

written finding, a written finding that sufficient

3

aggravating circumstances did not exist to justify a

4

death sentence, and a written finding that sufficient

5

mitigating circumstances do exist which outweigh any

6

aggravating circumstances.

7

The judge discharged the jury and directed a

8

pre-sentence investigation report, and a month later

9

entered his own written findings, and five years later,

10

in 1980, the judge substantially repeated the findings

11

when he reimposed the sentence after it was first

12

vacated on the basis of Gardner against Florida.

13

And the judge found seven aggravating

14

circumstances.

15

first one is quoted in our brief at Pages 29 and 30, and

16

in this one — this is at the bottom of Page 29 and the

17

bottom of Page 30.

18

aggravating circumstance that Barclay had some prior

19

arrests, and he had a prior conviction for forgery and

20

for breaking and entering.

21

Sow, let me review some of them.

The

In this one the judge found as an

Sow, it is acknowledged by the state that this

22

was an error, and the reason is that what the judge

23

found here was the absence of one of the statutory

24

mitigating circumstances, and it is acknowledged as a

25

matter of state law, it is acknowledged at Page 26,

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

I

1

think., of the state's brief, that under the state's

2

Mikenas case, which the state cites, that it is not

3

correct to make the absence of mitigating circumstances

4

an aggravating circumstance, so that that was a finding

5

that is a non-statutory finding.

6

aggravating circumstance that is not listed in the

7

statute.

8

9

It is a finding of an

There are two more points about that.

One is

that mere arrests under — and again, I am referring to

10

Florida law really as a predicate for the federal

11

arguments that I'll make later, but I am merely trying

12

to be descriptive.

13

arrests don't qualify as convictions, even if there is a

14

relevant crime involved, a violent crime under one of

15

the other subsections, and convictions can't be proved

16

by the presentence investigation report.

17

be proved by the state beyond a reasonable doubt at the

18

penalty trial.

Under the Florida law, the mere

They have to

Now, turning to the next two aggravating

19

20

circumstances found by the court, and these appear in

21

our brief at the bottom of Page 33 is one, and the next

22

one is over at Page 36, both of these are equally

23

flawed.

24

defendant was under a sentence of imprisonment at the

25

time of the murder, and it is undisputed that Barclay at

The first one has to do with whether or not the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

the time of the murder, Barclay was not in prison, he

2

was not supposed to be in prison, he was not on parole,

3

he was not on probation, none of that.

4

The judge found that he was not imprisoned at

5

the top of Page 34, but he said the criminal record was

6

an aggravating circumstance.

7

again was to take a past criminal record and say that it

8

was something like, it resembled the statutory

9

aggravating circumstance.

10
11

So what the judge did here

The judge did something similar with the next
one, at Page 36.

He said that — This provision is

2

whether or not the defendant had been convicted of a

3

felony involving the use or threat of violence to the

4

person, and there was nothing like that in Barclay's

5

record, but the judge said that, well, he had been

6

convicted of breaking and entering, and the judge said,

7

it is not known if that prior felony involved the use or

8

threat of violence, but he said, however, such crime can

9

and often does involve violence.

20

So, again, he found something really not in

2

terms of the statute, but he said, well, it is something

22

like the statute, so that we have three findings by the

23

Court which really aren't in terms of the statute.

24

judge said,

25

the statute.

The

well, I am finding something that resembles

8

1

Now, the fourth one is whether or not there is

2

— the murder created a great risk of death to many

3

persons.

4

beginning over at Page 40, and the judge found that —

5

the judges words, "Before, during, and after the

6

murder," the judge said, "there was a great risk of

7

death to many persons."
He based it on — he's got a before and an

8

9

And this one is discussed in our brief

after, but he doesn't have a during in there.

Before,

10

he said, the defendants drove around looking for a

11

victim, and it is undisputed that the victim was killed

12

in a deserted, lonely road, and that there was no one

13

else around, but the judge found that there was a great

14

risk of death to many persons based on the fact that

15

before finding a victim in a lonely, deserted spot,

16

looked at and decided not to attack people in groups in

17

other parts of the city.

18

that —

19
20
21

QUESTION:

they

It is a line of reasoning

Does that -- Do you feel that is a

totally unreasonable finding on the part of the judge?
MR. NABRITs

I do. Your Honor.

There is no

22

basis in that line of reasoning for distinguishing any

23

case from among many cases where a --

24
25

QUESTION:
occurs to me.

Let me suggest my own thought that

In the case of a premeditated murder, you

9
ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

could say that, you know, there was malice aforethought,

2

et cetera, but the murderer was presumably looking only

3

for one victim.

4

here one gets the impression from the judge's findings

5

that these people were looking not for one victim, but

6

for almost anybody they came across that met a certain

7

description.

8
9

He wasn't just going randomly.

MR. NABRIT;

But

Well, but a single victim who —

and they were looking for one alone.

I mean, the

10

purpose of the statute is to protect large groups of

11

people against death.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. NABRITi

Well, in —

14

MR. NABRITs

Well, let me put it in two -- let

Well --

15

me suggest there are two doctrines.

16

involve a lot of people, and two, under the Florida law,

17

it has to be an actual risk of harm or death based on

18

the nature of the murder or the conduct immediately

19

surrounding the murder.

20

QUESTIONi

One, it has to

You feel that the Florida law

21

wasn't designed to produce a great number of people even

22

though they might have been individually isolated or by

23

themselves?

24
25

MR. NABRIT;

I argue on both parts.

weren't any great number of people.

There

There was nobody

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 82S-9300

1

around at the time of the murder

2

— the decision not to attack, a large group of people

3

can’t be considered as endangering a large group of

4

people.

5

QUESTIONS

And the decision to

Mr. Nabrit, the Florida Supreme

6

Court, though, obviously found that as a matter of

7

Florida law it met their statutory aggravating

8

circumstance on that fourth factor.

9
10

11
12

13

MR. NABRIT:

That’s correct, and our

argument —
QUESTION:

So you are not asking us to say

that the Florida law is something else, are you?
MR. NABRIT:

No, my argument is that the — my

14

argument is a federal constitutional one, that there is

15

really no evidence of the offense or the statute is

16

construed in such a way that it is vague and overbroad.

17

It is an argument based on the Godfrey case at bottom,

18

but the — well, let's look at the other half of it the

19

judge relied on.

20

The judge relied on something that happened

21

three days after the murder, which is the mailing of

22

tapes, tape recordings to the news media, and said, this

23

event endangered a half-million people of Jacksonville.

24

The problem with that is the same one.

25

in the evidence.

There is nothing

The state never tried to prove that

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

there were any circumstances that made this dangerous.

2

This wasn’t the state's theory.

3
4

And so there is no evidence to support a
notion that anyone was in fact endangered.

5

How, there are three other aggravating

6

circumstances, and our argument is set forth in our

7

brief at Pages 48 to 63.

8

them, because my time is limited, and I will instead

9

turn to the main two legal arguments.
QUESTION*

10
11

When they came upon the victim, was

the victim alone or accompanied by others?

12
13

I think I will not go through

MR. NABRITj

Alone.

He was a single

hitchhiker, alone.

14

QUESTION*

Suppose there were two people

15

there.

16

judge making the decision to think that two people would

17

have been killed instead of one?

18

Would it be unreasonable or irrational for the

MR. NABRIT;

Well, the — well, I mean, there

19

are -- I — perhaps not.

There are several points.

One

20

is that two people even wouldn’t be enough to create

21

many people, to egual many people under the Florida law,

22

and it is set forth in our brief.

23

really is that this is a surprise overbroad construction

24

of the law based on — as the law has been interpreted

25

in those Florida cases.

So, our argument

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Now, we have two principal arguments.

Our

2

first argument is that the trial court sentencing

3

findings violated Barclay's rights under the Eighth and

4

Fourteenth Amendments, and the argument is, as I said

5

before, based not merely on the notion that state law

6

wasn't followed, but based on the idea that a

7

combination of non-statutory aggravating circumstances

8

and the factually base is so overbroad construction of

9

the Florida statute created the violation.

10

The second argument, which I will make later,

11

is really in the nature of a rebuttal argument.

12

our answer to the state’s contention that even if we are

13

correct about the first argument, there need not be a

14

reversal, that the error is in some way harmless or it

15

does not — at least it does not call for reversal.

16

It is

The main theme of the Eighth Amendment cases

17

from Furman down to date has been that consistency in

18

the avoidance of arbitrariness is the indispensable

19

element to the constitutionality of capital sentencing.

20

We think that the use of aggravating circumstances not

21

provided in the statute violates the Eighth Amendment

22

because it makes capital sentencing ungrounded and

23

arbitrary, and to establish that, we point to the three

24

main purposes that statutory aggravating circumstances

25

are supposed to serve.

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

The list of statutory circumstances is

2

supposed to enable the legislature to decide what kinds

3

of cases deserve the death penalty, so that there is a

4

legislative judgment represented by the limited list of

5

statutory aggravating circumstances.

6

example from our case of the prior criminal record, the

7

first one the judge used, the legislature of Florida

8

didn't decide that if someone had a prior record for a

9

prior arrest and a prior record for forgery, that that

And if you take an

10

was the kind of aggravating circumstance that justified

11

the death sentence.

12

The second purpose, the second function of the

13

statutory aggravating circumstances is to guide the

14

sentencer's exercise of discretion, to channel the

15

discretion.

16

And the third function was to provide a basis

17

for appellate review, so that the appellate court would

18

have a way of looking at the findings and attempting to

19

ensure that similar results would be reached in similar

20

cases, and it is our position that all three of these

21

purposes of statutory aggravating circumstances are

22

defeated if the judge is allowed, as the judge in this

23

case did, to make up the aggravating circumstances as he

24

goes along.

25

aggravating will be evaluated differently by another,

A factor that one judge will think

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and a judge presumably will change his view as time

2

passes, so that the danger of arbitrary decision-making

3

is reintroduced into the process.
QUESTION;

4

Mr. Nabrit, may I ask this one

5

question?

Is it your legal position that the same, if

6

there is one permissible aggravating circumstance that

7

has been properly found, or are you taking the position

8

that there are no statutory aggravating circumstances

9

that could properly be found on this record?
SR. NABRITj

10

We take the latter position, Your

11

Honor, but our argument is that there is a

12

constitutional violation based on the fact that even if

13

only some of them are outside the statute, that that

14

violates the Eighth Amendment, but we do take the latter

15

position.

16

each of the seven aggravating circum stances found by the

17

judge, and attempts to show that they are either outside

18

the statute or that they are flawed under the Godfrey

19

guide.

20

In our brief, Part 1-A of our brief addresses

QUESTION;

I take it if the Florida Supreme

21

Court agreed with your view that there were no statutory

22

aggravating circumstances, they also would have set

23

aside the death penalty.

24

MR. NABRIT;

25

QUESTION;

That's correct.

That's correct.

Yes.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION*

Mr. Nabrit, do you have any

2

thoughts as to how the Florida system compares with

3

Georgia's?

4

state, if I can describe it that way, so far as

5

aggravating circumstances are concerned, and I wondered

6

if you felt Florida was the same or was different.

7

I regard Georgia as kind of a threshold

ME. NABRIT;

No, I think it is different.

8

think there is nothing in the Florida decisions that

9

uses the threshold language or the language in the

10

recent opinion of the Georgia Supreme Court after the

11

remand in the Zandt case.

I

12

On the question of the Eighth Amendment, in

13

summary, I guess, our position is that the safeguards

14

that aggravating circumstances were supposed to serve

15

under the statute fell through in this case, that the

16

trial court really didn't live up to what was

17

represented in Proffit, to assure that after Barclay's

18

conviction there really would be an informed, focused,

19

guided, and objective inquiry into the question of

20

whether or not he would be sentenced to death, and I

21

think that none of those adjectives really fairly

22

describe the findings on which Barclay was sentenced to

23

death, and we submit that the sentence violates the

24

Eighth Amendment.

25

Now, turning to the second point, which as I

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

said before is a rebuttal argument, what we are doing in

2

Part 2 of our brief is answering the Attorney General’s

3

contention that Florida's rule, which is embodied in its

4

Elledge case, and which we will call the Elledge rule,

5

makes it appropriate for the court below to affirm even

6

if there were constitutional errors, even if there was a

7

violation of the Eighth Amendment, or several violations

8

of the Eighth Amendment of the kind that we complain

9

about in our first argument.
Let me describe the Elledge rule.

10

The Elledge

11

case provides really, as we see it, two rules for

12

dealing with a case where the trial court has made an

13

error, either an error by considering a non-statutory

14

aggravating circumstance or by misapplying one of the

15

statutory circumstances, but where there are other valid

16

aggravating factors remaining in the case.
Now, the Elledge case says that a reversal is

17
18

reguired, that that situation calls for a reversal if

19

there are statutory mitigating findings, because the

20

reviewing court can *t tell whether the error distorted

21

the weighing process, so that -- so, to be clear, under

22

Florida law, it is error to consider a non-statutory

23

aggravating circumstance, and they call it error.

24

call it error even in those cases where they don’t

25

reverse.

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

They

1

And the cases where they don't reverse are

2

under the second half of the Elledge rule, and that is

3

that the death sentence will be affirmed if there are no

4

statutory mitigating circumstances, no statutory

5

mitigating circumstances, and that is the -- the state

6

law premise of Elledge is in the language which is

7

quoted at the top of Page 87 of our brief.

8
9

The idea is that so long as there are some
statutory aggravating circumstances, there is no danger

10

that non-statutory circumstances have served to overcome

11

the mitigating circumstances in the weighing process, in

12

other words, that there is nothing to balance against

13

whatever aggravating circumstances remain, and therefore

14

Lockett, remember, was one where if there were statutory

sentence was mandatory.

7

It directly violates the

That was what that statute did, and the

8

Elledge case is identical in the way it ignores the

9

non-statutory mitigating factors, and the Ford case,

10

which I mentioned before, the Ford case in the Florida

11

Supreme Court, makes it plain that that is the way the

12

Elledge rule operates, because it shows that the Elledge

13

rule operates even if there are non-statutory mitigating

14

circumstances in the record.

was reversed, a case from the same judge, if that is the

of Elledge that could rule against Barclay.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALLACE E. ALLBRITTON, ESQ.,

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15

MR. ALLBRITTON;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

16

please the Court, the state of Florida has never claimed

17

that defendants in her courts receive a perfect trial,

18

but only a fair one, and as of this date, approximately

19

1:35 p.m., that is all the Constitution requires.

20

I think because of the multiplicity of

21

challenges hurled at cases availing the death penalty,

22

it would seem that the only time a capital defendant

23

receives a fair trial is when he is acquitted.

24

the overriding issue before this Court is whether the

25

imposition of the death penalty in the instant case

I think

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

contravenes any of the protections afforded by the

2

petitioner or to him under the Constitution, not only

3

the federal but the state.

4

A good starting place is the standard of

5

review followed by the Florida Supreme Court in its

6

review of death penalty cases.

7

logically so, that where there are multiple statutory

8

aggravating factors and there are no mitigating factors

9

at all, then the weighing process would have reached the

That court assumes, and

10

same outcome by the trial judge even had he not

11

considered what is termed an improper aggravating

12

factor.

13

Mow, this principle is well illustrated in

14

several cases, and I will mention only two of them.

15

is Dobbert v. State, where the Florida Supreme Court

16

held that the trial judge improperly found two

17

aggravating factors, but since there were no mitigating

18

factors at all, a reversal of the death sentence was not

19

required.

20

One

And in Ford v. State, cited on Page 15 of my

21

brief, the same result was reached by the Florida

22

Supreme Court, and what is interesting about both of

23

those cases is that this Court declined to review either

24

one of them on certiorari.

25

I have no hesitancy to urge to this Court that

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

petitioner’s death penalty was properly imposed based on

2

proof beyond a reasonable doubt of what I count as five

3

statutory aggravating factors, and no mitigating factors

4

at all.

5

In thinking about this, I want it to be

6

understood that in finding this non-statutory

7

aggravating factor that is now complained of to the

8

Court, the trial judge did not consider any evidence

9

that he would not have otherwise known.

Rather, it was

10

necessary for the trial judge to consider petitioner's

11

prior criminal record because unless the existence of

12

this mitigating factor is negated, then there will be a

13

presumption that petitioner had not engaged in any

14

previous course of crime at all.

15

This is again well illustrated in the Florida

16

Supreme Court case of Booker v. State, where that court

17

rejected, now, an argument that the trial judge had

18

considered a non-statutory aggravating factor because on

19

cross examination the defendant was interrogated as to

20

his prior criminal activity.

21

Now, the Florida Supreme Court pointedly

22

stated that those questions were posed to the defendant

23

in order to negate or show the absence of a mitigating

24

circumstance.

25

significant history of prior criminal actions.

That is, that the defendant had no

23

2

out, and I quote the words of the court;

3

Hr. Allbritton, do you plan to

12

address the Lewis case, as Justice Blackmun inquired

13

about, which appeared to hold that if a jury found that

14

the defendant should be sentenced to life, that was

15

treated as a mitigating circumstance then, and required

16

a different action when it was challenged by the

17

def endan t?

18

HR. ALLBRITTON;

Only to the extent that I

19

don't believe in the Lewis case that the Florida Supreme

20

Court so held.

21

but if we assume that they did so hold, then I say in

22

the instant case it has to be obvious that this

23

mitigating factor, that is,

24

jury, was completely overweighed by the multiple

25

statutory aggravating factors that were found by the

I don’t read the case that way at all,

10

The

Now, the

Now, I find this interesting, because this

11

aggravating factor of propensity to commit murder was

12

not then and never has been a statutorily enumerated

13

aggravating factor under Florida law.

14

there is no getting around the point that this Court

15

approved the use of a non-statutory aggravating factor

16

when used, now, along with other statutory aggravating

17

factors.

18

I think, frankly,

The decision in Elledge v. State supports the

19

respondent’s argument here, because the Elledge court in

20

construing Proffit read something in there, I believe,

21

that is not there, but rather than to go into that,

22

let's take Elledge the way it stands, and Elledge simply

23

holds that a non-statutory aggravating factor will not

24

vitiate a death penalty where there are other

25

statutorily enumerated factors and there are no

From the record

there was a non-statutory enumerated

Well, now, what the Florida Supreme Court

10

wanted to do, and what they did do, was to be sure that

11

a non-statutory aggravating factor would not be used to

12

offset a mitigating factor in the weighing process, but

13

we don't have that problem here, because there were no

14

mitigating factors at all unless you do as my honorable

15

opponent would urge you to do, and that is substitute

16

your judgment and reweigh all of the aggravating factors

17

that were weighed by the trial judge and approved by the

18

Florida Supreme Court.

If you do that, then you will depart from the
decision in Eddings v. Oklahoma.

It's entirely a matter within the

And that is what they

They don’t reweigh in the sense, if you please, to

I think, too, that the Florida Supreme Court

12

standard of review in death penalty cases can be

13

reviewed actually for what it is, and that is the

14

application of the harmless error rule.

15

nothing new in this, because more than 30 years ago in

16

North v. State, decided in 1952, the Florida Supreme

17

Court expressly held that the harmless error rule was

18

applicable in capital cases.

19

Now, there is

And not only that, in the two Ferguson cases,

20

which I cite in my brief, the application of the

21

harmless error rule is clear.

22

417 Southern 2nd 631, the Court held that, and I quote,

23

"Any error that occurred in the consideration of the

24

inapplicable aggravating circumstances was harmless."

25

For example, in Ferguson,

And again, in Ferguson 417 639, the Court held

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

that any error that occurred in the consideration of the

2

two inapplicable aggravating factors was harmless, based

3

on the weighing process that the judge followed.

4

And interestingly, in the recent case of Ford

5

v. Strickland, Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals en banc

6

opinion filed January 7th,

7

a dissenting opinion in part and specially concurring in

8

part, stated that he interpreted the Florida Supreme

9

Court to apply a harmless error rule in refusing to

1983, Chief Judge Godbold, in

10

order resentencing, and that the Florida Supreme Court’s

11

actions so interpreted passed constitutional muster.

12

This Court, several Justices, I think, have

13

opted for the application of the harmless error rule.

14

In Zant v. Stevens, Justice Powell, in a dissenting

15

opinion, stated he would leave it open to the Georgia

16

Supreme Court to decide whether it had authority to find

17

that the instruction complained of was harmless error.

18

In Drake v.

19

a denial of cert, stated that as a matter of general

20

constitutional policy, he thought it essential that

21

appellate courts be able to employ a harmless error

22

rule.

Zant, Justice White dissents, dissenting to

23

In fact, this Court has employed the harmless

24

error rule in several cases, Schnevel v. State, Meritan

v. Wainwright, Harrington v. California, and in the

Now, then, looking at Petitioner's brief, the

"We do not weigh the evidence for them."

that Lockett held that while the sentencing authority

must not be precluded from reviewing anything offered as

mitigating, it did not undertake to dictate the weight

that the various factors are to be given by the trial

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES M. NABRIT, III, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

MR. NABRIT*

9

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

please the Court, in the few moments I have left, I

10

would like to talk about how I see the harmless error

11

concept coming into this case, and also say something

12

about the Lewis case.

13

I think a factual point to be made about how

14

Lewis fits in here is that there were facts upon which

15

the jury might reasonably have found that there were

16

both statutory and non-statutory mitigating

17

circumstances for Barclay.

18

based on the record that he was a follower, he was not

19

the leader of the group of people who were convicted of

20

the murder.

22

man, only 23 years old.

23

The argument of counsel was

And a major factor that was emphasized to the

24

jury was the disparity of sentencing, the disparity of

25

punishment between Barclay and the other two people who

got second-degree murder but who the jury knew had

2

committed two murders, that were-sentenced to terms of

3

imprisonment.

The jury also might very well have based its

finding on either of four of the statutory mitigating

factors, the age, the fact that the state did not prove

Now, turning to the harmless error point, this
is not really a harmless error case in the ordinary
