ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WALLACE;

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, this employment discrimination case

11

involves a claim of disparate treatment which is under

12

this Court’s decisions of claim of intentional racial

13

discrimination, under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights

14

Act.
The case is before the Court for a second

15
16

time.

17

by Solicitor General McCree, the Court with two Justices

18

dissenting vacated and remanded the case for further

19

consideration in light of Texas Department of Community

20

Affairs against Burdine, and the case is now here on

21

certiorari from the court of appeals decision on that

22

remand.

both of the petitions, focuses exclusively on the legal

8

stated.

With respect to the promotions and details at

9

issue, after an administrative investigation and hearing

10

and appeal from that hearing were all resolved against

11

him, the Bespondent filed suit under Title VII in the

12

district court.

13

the Respondent, along with other individuals under

14

consideration, had the qualifications necessary to be

15

eligible for the promotions and details, and there was

16

no dispute that Respondent is a black person, and that

17

the Postal Service selected white employees for the

18

particular promotions and details at issue instead of

19

Respondent.

The Postal Service did not deny that

\

20

The district court found that from 1952 to

21

1966, Respondent had advanced steadily through a

22

succession of supervisory positions in the D.C. Post

23

Office, and by ^arch of 1973, he was the fifth highest

ranking official in that Post Office.

and no other direct evidence that he was treated any

2

differently because of his race from the way other

3

employees were treated.

evidence that he was as qualified or more qualified than

been a considerable increase in the number of black

9

employees occupying high level positions in the District

10

of Columbia Post Office during the pertinent period, and

11

that during that period, other blacks as well as whites

12

were promoted or detailed to positions above the

13

Respondent’s position, and that by the time of the

14

district court’s opinion, almost all the high level '

15

positions in that post office were held by blacks.

16

It also found that there had

17

clearly erroneous, and for present purposes, even though

18

it’s possible that other inferences could have been

19

drawn from the underlying facts,

20

some length in Respondent’s brief, the underlying

21

evidence, for present purposes, those findings are the

22

premise of the case, because they are the premise on

23

which the court of appeals rendered its decision, and

24

those facts found by the district court do not in our

25

view add up to a prima facie case of discrimination.

which are rehearsed at

ALDEHSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
■MO FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 12021 628-9300

The reason for this can be simply stated.

1

If

2

unexplained, those findings do not show that it is more

3

likely than not that the employer’s selection was based

4

on an impermissible consideration, such as race, to

5

paraphrase this Court’s opinion in the Fernco case, or

6

if unexplained, these facts do not show circumstances

7

giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination,

a

to paraphrase what this Court said in the Burdine case.
In other words, when this Court had spoken

9

10

generically about what constitutes a prima facie case of

11

discrimination under Title VII, the standard is really

12

no different from what it is in establishing any other

13

prima facia case, a showing that if the showing is

14

unrefuted in any way, that it is more likely than not

15

that the case has been proven.
QUESTION:

16

Mr. Wallace, when you say prima

17

facie case, what exactly do you mean?

18

enough to get by a motion for a directed verdict if the

19

case is tried?
MR. WALLACE:

20

Do you mean

That is the way most of these

21

cases arise,

on a Rule 41(b) motion at the conclusion of

22

the plaintiff’s evidence, and that is what we mean here,

23

what we are referring to here, and by and large what the

24

Court has been referring to in its opinions in this

25

field.

QUESTION:

1

And it is not inconsistent with

2

that to say that if the employer puts on no evidence, or

3

does nothing, there must be judgment for the plaintiff?

4

MR. WALLACE;

5

QUESTION;

It's not inconsistent at all.

But isn’t that what is required,

6

under the existing rule under Title VII, that if the

7

employer does nothing, judgment must be entered for

8

the —
MR. WALLACE:

9
10
11
12

That is what this Court said in

Burdine.
QUESTION;

Well, then it is something more

than a motion to get by a directed verdict.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WALLACE:

15

directed verdict in these cases.

16

tried to the Court.

17

since the standard of proof is the preponderance of the

18

evidence, if the district court at the conclusion of the

19

plaintiff's evidence concludes that that evidence shows

20

that it is more likely than not that discrimination was

21

a factor and the — and therefore denies the ai(b)

22

motion, and

23

as saying that he has met his burden of showing by a

24

preponderance of the evidence.

25

I don’t think it is.
Well, it is not really a

KB. WALLACE:

Wall, it’s conceivable,

Mr.

12

Justice, although he would be more likely to be

13

reserving judgment on whether the plaintiff has made out

14

a sufficient case to withstand the Rule 41(b) motion.

15

He can’t really be depending on the defendant’s evidence

16

to complete the plaintiff’s showing.

17

QUESTIONS

Well, as a matter of prudence, a

18

trial judge might simply decide, might he not, that he

19

would like the whole record there so that if there is an

20

appeal it will be disposed of in one stroke?

21

MR. WALLACE;

He may very well, and that’s

22

essentially what happened in this case.

There was a

23

full trial in this case, although at the end of it the

24

district court ruled, as the court of appeals read its

25

ruling, that the plaintiff had failed to establish a

8

1

prima facia case.

In any event —

QUESTION:

2

Would not the obligation of the

3

reviewing court be to decide — go on beyond that and

4

decide whether, assuming arguendo that a prima facie

5

case had been made out, that the preponderance of the

6

evidence didn't support the plaintiff?
SR. WALLACE:

7

Well, we read the district

8

court's opinion in this case as passing on that question

9

as well, because the district court did hear all the

10

evidence, but the court of appeals disagreed with us.

11

We filed a petition for rehearing the first time the

12

case was in the court of appeals, making that point, and

13

that petition for rehearing was denied.
We have not contested that issue further

14
15

before this Court, either on the first petition or on

16

the second petition.

17

appeals' ruling that in effect the district court

18

granted the Rule 41(b) motion after hearing all of the

19

evidence.

20

QUESTION:

We have accepted the court of

But in no other branch of the law

21

where there's been a trial, where the plaintiff puts on

22

evidence, the defendant puts on evidence, the judge

23

enters findings of fact and conclusions of law, would

24

something on appeal be talked about as failure to make

25

out a prima facie case.

MO FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (2021 628-9300

Do you think our decisions make the Title VII

1
2

litigation unique for some reason?
MR. WALLACE;

3

I do not, Mr. Justice.

As I

4

said, we thought initially that the court of appeals was

5

in error in the way it read the district court’s

6

judgment in the case, but the district court's

7

conclusions were not a model of clarity.

8

conclusion,

9

plaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case,

In one

the district court did say that the

10

although the district court had earlier denied the 41(b)

11

motion.

12

As we read what happened, the court of appeals

13

in effect said that the district court belatedly granted

14

the Rule 41(b)

15

as if the district court had not made findings about

16

whether the prima facie case had been rebutted by the

17

defendant, even though the evidence may well have been

18

heard here in its entirety.

19

motion in this case, and treated the case

We don’t really regard the procedural rules

20

for Title VII cases as different from those in any other

21

field of law.

22

a misuse by the court of appeals in this circuit and by

23

some other lower courts of the more particularized

24

analytical framework that this Court applied in the

25

McDonnell Douglas against Green case, that fit the facts

The confusion has stemmed, we think, from

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (2021 628-9300

1

of that particular case in analyzing whether a prima

2

facie case had been made out on the facts that were

3

before the Court there.

4

We don't regard that framework as inconsistent

5

with the later, more generic descriptions of what

6

constitutes a prima facie case that I adverted to

7

earlier in my argument, but rather as a useful

8

analytical guide to the particular facts that were

9

before the Court in McDonnell Douglas against Green, and

10
11

that analysis is set forth on Page 6 of our brief.
And it fit that case very well, because it

12

showed not only that the plaintiff was a minority

13

applicant who applied and was gualified for the job, and

14

despite his qualifications was rejected, but

15

importantly, there’s a fourth element, that after his

16

rejection, the employer, contrary to his apparent

17

economic self-interest, continued to carry the vacancy

18

that he was trying to fulfill and continued to look for

19

applications from persons of the plaintiff's

20

qualifications.

21

Sow, what the court below has failed to

22

recognize is that in a different factual circumstance

23

where that fourth element is neutralized by the

24

employer's mere selection of one qualified applicant

25

over another, these four elements in themselves no

longer add up to a prima facie case that makes it more %

QUESTION;

2

So you think in McDonnell if there

3

had been two applicants, one black and one white, both

4

qualified, that the — just because the white was chosen

5

would not make out a prima facie case?
MR. WALLACE:

6

That is exactly our point, Mr.

7

Justice, that there has to be a showing of something

8

more than these four elements if the fourth element is

9

neutralized, because the fourth element was a necessary

10

part of what added up to the prima facie case as those

11

facts were analyzed, because it was an element of an

12

employer acting contrary to his apparent economic

13

self-interest, and therefore put a burden of production

14

on him.

15

burden of production on him to come forward or else

16

judgment would be re-entered against him to explain why

17

he acted contrary to his apparent economic

18

self-interest.

19

The burden of persuasion never shifts, but a

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, is it the government’s

20

position that the plaintiff in this case would have met

21

the burden that you say he should have met had he

22

established

23

than the person selected?

24
25

that he was as qualified or more qualified

MR. WALLACE:

Well, in order to come up with

something comparable to the fourth element here, to show

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST,, N.W., WASHINGTON, 0.0. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

that the employer was acting contrary to his apparent

2

economic self-interest, one would have to say that that

3

would be shown by his selecting someone less qualified

4

than the plaintiff.

If he is merely selecting someone
/

5

equally qualified, the fourth element remains

6

neutralized in our view.

7

that so long as impermissible considerations are not the

8

governing factor, an employer has discretion to choose

9

among equally qualified persons.

10

11

QUESTIONS

Well, isn't the utlimate question

the question of discriminatory intent?

12

MR. WALLACE:

13

QUESTION;

14

an inference of —
MR. WALLACE:

16

QUESTION;

18

That is the ultimate question.

And what set of facts will justify

15

17

This Court said in Burdine

Precisely so.

And in McDonnell it did, and you

say here it does not.
MR. WALLACE:

That is our point, that — the

19

fact that four elements were specified in McDonnell that

20

added up to a prima facie showing has misled the court

21

below into thinking that those are the only four

22

elements one needs to analyze in a case of this sort,

23

and even though the fourth element becomes neutralized

24

by applying it to a different set of facts, the formula

25

has been woodenly carried over to this different set of

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

facts
QUESTION;

2

Nr. Wallace, does the government

3

place any reliance on the fact that this case was a

4

promotional decision rather than an original entry

5

decision?

6

HR. WALLACE;

We don't really think that makes

7

a difference from a situation where a new hire is made

8

by selecting from among a group of qualified

9

applicants.

10

QUESTION;

Well, isn’t there some difference

11

at any rate?

12

Douglas type hiring, you have presumably an

13

indeterminate number of vacancies and minimum

14

qualifications, and the inference is from business

15

practice that the first people who come along and meet

16

those minimum qualifications are going to be hired, but

17

with a promotional decision, you frequently have only

18

one vacancy, and a finite number of applicants within

19

the organization.

20

If you think of the ordinary WcDcnnell

NR. WALLACE;

So long as there is a situation

21

where the vacancy is carried in the initial hiring

22

situation for any period of time where it would have

23

been presumably economically advantageous to the

24

employer to hire someone, then a prima facie case has

25

been shown in our view, but if you have a situation

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
A40 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

where it is known that a vacancy will be upcoming in a

2

period of weeks or months, and applications are being

3

collected and scrutinized, and then a selection is made

4

to replace the individual who is retiring or leaving by

5

selecting from among the applicants, that doesn’t show

6

that the employer acted in some way contrary to his

7

economic interests, and unless there is something more

8

of a showing, we don’t see that a prima facie case of

9

discrimination has been shown by the'mere fact that

10

another qualified applicant was selected rather than the

11

plaintiff.

12

That is our point.
QUESTIONS

Xr. Wallace, as I read Judge

13

Wilkie's dissenting opinion, he was suggesting still a

14

different test, and I wondered if you wanted to comment

15

on his approach.

16

MR. WALLACEj

Well, we think that, you know,

17

there is much food for thought in what Judge Wilkie

18

wrote, but he as well as the other members of the court

19

of appeals focused exclusively in this case on whether

20

there had been a sufficient showing of the second

21

element of the four elements in the McDonnell Douglas

22

analysis, a showing that the plaintiff in this case was

23

qualified for the job.

24

There had been some dispute about that during

25

the trial, because he had refused to accept assignments

15

ALDEPSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to certain positions that were said to have been

2

positions that would have made him better qualified to

3

be considered for the promotions that he was interested

4

in.

5

whether the employer had adequately specified that that

6

kind of experience was a desirable qualification, even

7

though not necessarily an indispensable qualification

8

for the position at issue.

9

And ultimately, the court of appeals focused on

But no one on the court of appeals recognized

10

that the real shortcoming was not that he wasn’t

11

qualified, at least minimally, for consideration for

12

these jobs,

13

showing that it was more likely than not that the

14

selection resulted from discrimination because the

15

fourth element had been neutralized in the McDonnell

16

Douglas analysis.

17

but that he didn’t show it added up to a

QUESTION;

Hell, Mr. Wallace, it seems to me

18

that if this case — if there were proof in this case

19

that the applicant for the position was more qualified,

20

that would necessarily determine the fourth element, I

21

would think.

22
23
24
25

MR. WALLACE;

That is one way of showing that

the employer —
QUESTION;

And as you said before, it would

not if he was just equally qualified, or less

CORRECTED

qualified.

2

HR. WALLACE:

3

QUESTION:

That is correct, but —

So isn't the absence -- This record

4

doesn’t show, or there are no findings on the relative

5

qualifications.

6

MR. WALLACE:

Well, there is a finding that

7

there is no credible evidence that he showed that he was

8

as qualified or more qualified than the applicant —

9

than the successful applicants.

There is a finding to

10

that effect.

11

permitted the drawing of a different inference, but that

12

is the inference that the district court drew, and the

13

court of appeals —

14

QUESTION:

15
16
17
18

The underlying evidence would have

The court of appeals didn't

overturn that.
MR. WALLACE:

— didn't overturn it.

And that

is the premise on which the case is in this Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, you say the court of

19

appeals diin’t overturn it, but they do say — the first

20

of the two errors that they say the lower court made was

21

that the majority on the first appeal rejected the

22

district court's — it calls it a legal conclusion,

23

guess, but that the appellant's claim failed because he

24

did not prove that he was as qualified or more qualified

25

than the individuals who were promoted, and then earlier

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

I

1

they had said that they had concluded he was more

2

qualified, or as qualified or more qualified, and Judge

3

Wilkie said they shouldn't have done that, that they

4

were finding facts which they should, but weren't they

5

implicitly saying that the finding was clearly

6

erroneous?

7

2R. WALLACE;

8

QUESTION;

9

10

Well, one could —

It's a little hard to understand,

because they also talk about it as a summary judgment,

I

know.
KR. WALLACE;

11

Yes.

One could possibly read it

12

that way.

The way we have read it is that they were

13

holding that it was legally irrelevant whether he was as

14

qualified or more qualified.

15

qualified for the job and the job went to a non-minority

16

applicant, the standards of the KcDonnell Douglas

17

analysis had been met, and that it wasn't a proper legal

That is one element of his holding

that the court of appeals said was erroneous.
MR. WALLACE*

Well, perhaps -- perhaps upon

11

re-evaluation by the court of appeals, they would want a

12

further finding made by the district court, although the

13

rest of the district court’s findings do not add up to a

prima facie case regardless of whether the district

15

court made a legal error in its discussion of the lack

16

of evidence of discriminatory motive.

17

So long as the court of appeals does not set

18

aside any of these findings, factual findings, as

clearly erroneous, it seems to us the judgment that must

be entered is clear.

HR. WALLACE;

still do not add ap to a prima facie case, and there is

nothing left for the district court to resolve in his

I don't see that that is critical to the district

Because there was evil ence in the

something like 20 o r 25 vacancies that were regularly

filled by a white p erson who had less educa tion, less

one could draw an i nference of discriminati on from that

might have erred by thinking he had to have direct

evidence of imprope r motive.

HR. WALLACE;

Well, that is conceivable,

although he did specifically find that there was no

submit that focusing solely on the issue that is before

this Court as to whether one made a prima facie case,

that a prima facie case is made when it is demonstrated

18

that the person in whose sole control the promotions

19

were, and who never promoted a black person, but

promoted 29 or 30 whites, made remarks of that sort, and

made was that there was an immense statistical disparity

In a total range of cases involving jury

But the question is whether those

statistics are meaningful unless you know what the

statistics were at the data the Act was passed, and does

the record show that?
MR. GREENBERG:

the issue before this Court is, given such overwhelming

MR. GREENBERG*

This is two years after the

plausible explanation for it.

there is, but I think it is up to the government to make

it, and the issue is, was there a prima facie case.

Have you got some cases on that?

MR. GREENBERG:

In Teamsters, there is —

there is a long footnote which discusses the use of

had not occupied those positions, and some of them had

he believed — unless he disbelieves the witnesses.

simply testifies to facts which could support an

10

inference, that the inference becomes mandatory?
ME. GREENBERG:

11

I think that's what McDonnell

12

Douglas says.

13

Douglas is a rule, as I understand it, and it was

14

reiterated in Burdine, and if I recall correctly, in

15

Footnote 7, that if the evidence called for in the

16

McDonnell Douglas case is presented, it then creates a

presumption that there has been discrimination, which

discrimination remains an important problem in the

resolved to attack, and eradicate, the McDonnell Douglas

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G.

WALLACE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. WALLACE;

We do not say that there is no

12

possible way of reading this record to give rise to a

13

prima facie case of discrimination, or that there is no

14

possibility that the court of appeals could have

15

overturned the district court's factual findings as

16

clearly erroneous.

17

of appeals, not this Court.

18

We think that is a job for the court

What we are concerned about is the standard

19

that the court of appeals has applied in this and in

20

other cases, and that is now generally applicable to

21

cases with much simpler underlying facts for the

22

establishment of a prima facie case, and that we believe

23

is erroneous.

24
25

We see no inconsistency with this Court's
holding in Burdine.

In Footnote 6 of the Burdine

opinion, it is pointed out that the prima facie case was

2

made there because the plaintiff showed that she was a

3

qualified woman who sought an available position, but

4

the position was left open for several months before she

5

finally was rejected in favor of a male who had been

6

under her supervision.
QUESTION;

7

So you think, the plaintiff as part

8

of his priraa facie case is going to have to prove that

9

he was more qualified than —
HR. WALLACE;

10
11

Well, that's one way of showing

it.

12

QUESTION:

That's one way.

13

HR. WALLACE:

That's one way of showing that

the employer acted contrary to his economic

self-interest, or a showing can be made through

16

statistics or through direct evidence of discrimination,

17

or through the carrying of a —

How would statistics show that he

acted contrary to his economic self-interest?
HR. WALLACE:

No, well, that is only — acting

showing a prima facie case.

23

alternative method.

24

QUESTION:

25

A statistical showing is an

MR. WALLACE;

QUESTION:

The statistical showing?

statistics.
MR. WALLACE:

It is not frequent.

There was

some effort made to do it here, as well as an effort

8

VII cases has been a presumption requiring judgment if

9

the defendant has not come forward with any

The only

10

non-discriminatory explanation after the prima facie

11

case has been made.

12

In practice, this question seldom arises

13

because the plaintiff usually knows what the defendant's

14

explanation is before the plaintiff ever puts on his own

15

case, and his rebuttal of that explanation is usually

16

put on as part of the plaintiff's case.

2

And then the Rule 41(b) motion

3

is made, and the question is whether the trier of fact

4

thinks it more likely than not that discrimination was

5

the motivating factor.
QUESTION;

6

Mr. Wallace, may I ask you one

7

other question on your theory?

The district judge at

8

the end of his conclusions of law stated that the

9

plaintiff had failed to prove that he was -- let's see

10

if I can find the exact — that he was "as qualified or

11

more qualified than the individuals who were promoted or

12

detailed."

That was a reason why there was no prima

3

facie case.

I don't understand you to be arguing that

4

in every case the plaintiff must prove either equal or

5

superior qualifications.

6

MR. WALLACE;

7

QUESTION;

That is correct.

There are other ways which he could

prove it even under your view.

true in McDonnell-Douglas itself.

he was minimally qualified, but that the employer
