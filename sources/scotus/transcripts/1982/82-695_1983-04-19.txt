ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MS. KITCHING:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;

8

There are two issues in this case today.

first issue is whether the district court ever had

The

Could you raise your

voice a little, Ms. Kitching.

13

MS. KITCHING:

Yes.

14

The second question is whether the California

15

tax collection statute has been preempted by the

16

provisions of the Employee Income Security Act of 1974,

17

otherwise Known as ERISA.
This lawsuit began because various taxpayers

Ms. Kitching, when you say that

California relied solely on state law, is that true of

We have a

QUESTION:

Well, I realize that statute gave

18

you the procedural vehicle for a declaratory judgment.

19

But what was the substance of your claim for a

20

declaratory judgment that there had been no preemption?

21

MS. KITCHING:

We wanted them to honor future

22

levies and we alleged that their defense of preemption

23

as to why they were not honoring our levies was not a

24

valid defense.

discuss some federal authorities?

MS. KITCHING;

Well, not necessarily in my

Not in your prayer, perhaps, and

everybody would concede that if your claim had simply

been that, you owe us the taxes because California

17

no — under the well-pleaded complaint doctrine, there

18

is no raising of a federal question.

19

3ut I’m wondering whether when you add to that

20

a declaratory judgment prayer you don’t, based on

21

preemption, you don't perhaps raise a federal question.

22

MS. KITCHING;

No, I don’t believe we do under

23

the authority of this Court, because that's only

24

anticipating what the defense of the Defendant was going

25

to be, which was going to be based on federal law.

The only way that federal law entered the case

QUESTION:

Well, but didn't the complaint

itself, though, refer to the question about whether

10

ERISA preempted the levy and referred to the position on

11

the face of the complaint taken by the trust fund, the

12

trustees?

13

MS. KITCHING:

Yes, the complaint set out the

14

position of the trustees.

15

their defense to the state cause of action.

16

was not relying on ERISA for anything in this case.

17

ERISA entered the case as a defense, and under the

18

authorities of this Court anticipating the Defendant's

19

defense does not create federal subject matter

20

jurisdiction.

21

But again, that was simply
The state

We did not need federal law to collect our

22

taxes or to receive a declaratory judgment under

23

California law.

24

As I said, the trustees relied on ERISA as a
defense to the California causes of action.

And again,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

as I said, this Court has held for many years that this

2

defense does not create federal subject matter

3

jurisdiction.
The trustees argue that they could have

4
5

brought the action in federal court.

However, there are

6

problems with this allegation.

7

not do that; and second of all, any action that they

8

would have brought in federal court would have been

9

barred by the provisions of 28 U.S.C.

First of all, they did

1341, the Tax

10

Injunction Act, which declares that no district court

11

shall enjoin the collection of the tax where there is a

12

plain, speedy and efficient remedy in state court.
This case should have been remanded to state

13
14

court.

15

preempts the California statute.

16

not prevail in the California state court, they had the

17

option of pursuing this matter ultimately to this

18

Court.

That court was competent to decide whether ERISA

challenged the levy, since the California statute seems
to limit to only the taxpayers the right to challenge.
US. KITCHING:

Well, it's the position of the

Franchise Tax Board that the trustees could have
defended in the lawsuit which had been brought against
them.
QUESTIONi

They couldn't have brought an

action had they been concerned?
MS. KITCHING:

No.

Actually, we feel they

could have brought an action, too.

Had they paid the

money over, they could have filed a claim with the State
Board of Control, and if that claim were denied then
they would have the right to bring an independent action
against the Franchise Tax Board for conversion and
litigate whether they should have turned over their
funds.
So we feel they had adequate remedies at state
law.
20ESTI3N;

Well, what if the trustees had gone

to the federal court in the first place, beat you to the
courthouse, and wanted a declaratory judgment that ERISA
did preempt your tax scheme?

Do you think there would

have been federal jurisdiction?
MS. KITCHINGi

No, I don't believe so, because

QUESTION;

Do you think — why not?

2

MS. KITCHINGs

Because of 28 U.S.C. 1341.

They clearly would have been enjoining the collection of

a tax.

would there have been federal jurisdiction?

That's their sole claim

If they can use a statute under

ERISA, they probably have jurisdiction in the federal

Going to the principles of preemption, as this

Court has stated many times preemption is not lightly to

be presumed.

23

should not be preempted unless that was the clear and

manifest intent of Congress.

ERISA’s preemption provision is Section 514.

It is more reasonable

This interpretation is supported by the

23

comments of Representative John Dent and Senator

Harrison Williams, who said that the purpose of the

preemption clause was to eliminate the threat of

The preemption section•has, recently been

7
8

amended.

The background of this amendment begins with

9

certain Hawaii statutes that required employers in

10

Hawaii to provide health insurance benefits for their

11

employees.

12

the case of Standard Oil versus Agsalud, where the

13

employer argued that the health insurance laws were

14

preempted by ERISA.

15

Court affirmed.

16

These laws were challenged by an employer in

The Ninth Circuit agreed and this

In order to save the concept of the Hawaii

17

law, which was that all employees in the State of Hawaii

18

be provided with health insurance by their employers,

19

Congress amended Section 514.

20

Hawaii's health insurance plan from preemption and

21

states that nothing in the new exemption shall be

22

construed to exempt from preemption any state tax law

23

relating to employee benefit plans.

24
25

This amendment exempts

The words "state tax law" must be interpreted
within the context of the Hawaii amendment, as these

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

words were included in Section 514(a)(5), which deals

2

exclusively with the Hawaii problem.

3

also be interpreted within the context of the Agsalud

4

case, where Hawaii unsuccessfully argued that the

5

payment reguired from the employer was a tax.

6

"tax law" in the amendment were apparently a response to

7

what Hawaii was attempting to classify as a tax.

The words

The complete Section 514, the only place I

The words must

believe it's set out in any of the briefs is in the

10

amicus brief of the State of Connecticut on pages 10 and

11

11, which sets out the former Section 514 and the

12

amendment, which are Sections (5) and (6).
The only pertinent comment in regard to tax

13
14

laws in the legislative history with regard to the

15

amendment comes from Senator Dole, who stated that the

16

amendment was intended to exempt Hawaii's health plan

17

from preemption, but preclude Hawaii from imposing tax

18

liability on insurance premiums or benefits.

19

Dole's comment on tax laws is the reason why the words

20

"tax law" appear in the amendment, then the California

21

statute does not fall within the real of Senator Dole's

22

concern.

23

If Senator

Moreover, there is evidence that the Hawaii

24

amendment lid not change the scope of Section 514.

25

According to the Senate Committee on Finance, the

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

amendment "does not affect the status under the

2

preemption provisions of ERISA of any state tax law

3

relating to employee benefit plans.”

4

In addition, the Conference Report explained

5

that the amendment continues preemption of state law

6

"with respect to matters governed by the reporting and

7

disclosure and the fiduciary responsibility provisions

8

of ERISA, as well as certain provisions of the

9

administration and enforcement rules of ERISA." If the

10

amendment is interpreted within the context of the

11

Agsalud case and the legislative history of the Hawaii

12

amendment, then the words "state tax law" can be seen

13

not to expand the scope or intent of Section 514.

14

It must also be noted that the amendment again

15

uses the words "relate to."

16

not relate to benefit plans either before or after the

17

Hawaii amendment.

The California statute did

With these facts in mind, it is clear that the
California statute is not affected by this amendment.

Normally, withholding would catch those that do opt, if
they're in there for just a short time and then go out
and leave the state.
MS. KITCHINGs
Your Honor.

Well, in some cases it would,

In not all cases, however, did it cover

their tax liability.

Sometimes there are assessments

after the return is filed and there's an audit and it's
determined that the taxpayer owes more money.

Perhaps

it hasn't withheld enough money to cover his tax
liability.
QUESTION:

This is just a test case, of

course, but the great sum of $308 or something like
that?
MS. KITCHING;

That's right, Your Honor.

However, there are over 400,000 people who belong to
vacation trusts in California, and millions of dollars
per year are contributed by the employers into these
accounts.
In this case the Department of Labor has
provided its opinion that the California statute has
been preempted.

However, this opinion is of little

assistance because it simply cites sections of ERISA and
the trust agreement and comes to the conclusion,

with no

legal analysis.
It should be noted that the Department of

HR. WATSON;

Hr. Watson?

decision of this Court almost 50 years ago through Hr.

QUESTION:

I think the federal question

Mr. Watson, it is correct, is it

21

not, that the entire prayer of the complaint, the four

22

paragraphs after the ''wherefore," say nothing at all

23

about anything federal?

24
25

MR. WATSON:

That is right, Your Honor.

It's

the prayer.

Under some Ninth Circuit authorities, I

2

might add, the prayer itself is not considered part of

3

the text of the complaint, only the allegations of the

4

complaint and the incorporated exhibits.
QUESTION;

5

Would you not also agree that the

6

reference to the federal claim is in the nature of what

7

the Defendants will assert by way of defense?
HR. WATSON;

8
9

I would agree that the Board has

laid out the federal question and stated that it is the

10

position of the trust that there is a federal

11

preemption, that is true.

I have no quarrel with that.

Certainly the state has a contention, however,

12
13

also about the effect of the federal law, albeit a

14

negative one.
QUESTION;

15

But the prayer for relief and what

16

they ask for is not a claim arising under federal law,

17

is it?
HR. WATSON:

18

The declaratory judgment action

19

they have filed is not a federal remedy and their claim

20

is founded on a California statute, that is clear.
QUESTION;

HR. WATSON;

I believe could have. Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

On what grounds?

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. WATSON

Well, I believe it raises an

issue under Section 301.

At least in the Ninth Circuit,

it has been held that collective bargaining agreements
-- and trust fund documents are considered collective
bargaining agreements in the Ninth Circuit under the
Behmar case — that third parties —
QUESTIONS

How does 301 get here?

MR. WATSON:

Well, 301 gets here because 301

provides that there is concurrent jurisdiction in state
and federal courts of suits —
QUESTION:

Did the complaint allege anything

about 301?
MR. WATSON:

It did not mention 301.

QUESTION:

Well, I asked could this complaint

have been filed in a federal court.
MR. WATSON:

It could have.

QUESTION:

Originally?

MR. WATSON:
QUESTION:

It could have.
And on what basis?

MR. WATSON:

On the basis that the state as a

third party under our Ninth Circuit law would have the
right, since it asserts a claim arising under this
collective bargaining agreement — it says, the trust
fund holds assets, the trustees are obligated to give
those assets to us --

In federal court, yes, we would.
You'd have been in there fighting

just like you're fighting now, wouldn't you?

6

HR. WATSON;

Yes, I would, and gladly so.

7

If I may now turn to the first of my reasons

8

why I think there is federal question jurisdiction here,

9

under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA Congress gave

10

fiduciaries the right to bring suit to obtain a

11

determination of rights and obligations under a trust

12

agreement such as this or under ERISA itself, and

13

provided that federal courts would have exclusive

14

jurisdiction over such suits.

15

Now, it's the position of the trustees in this

16

case that the Congressional intent is clear that federal

17

courts decide these issues.

18

provide for exclusive federal court jurisdiction of

19

these cases unless Congress intended that.
QUESTION;

20

There would be no reason to

But the Tax Injunction Act, which

21

Congress also passed, certainly would indicate that the

2

would not raise the fiduciary issue.
A second reason, however, exists to provide

3

that the Tax Injunction Act would not apply here.

In

4

Mitchum versus Foster, a 1972 decision of this Court

5

through Mr. Justice Stewart, the Court held that in

6

cases of conflicts between federal statutes providing

7

for injunctive remedies and the general federal

8

anti-injunction statute, that 28 U.S. Code 2283, the

9

Court must look to see whether application of the

10

general anti-injunction statute would frustrate the

11

Congressional purpose in enacting the subsequent law

12

providing for injunctive relief.

13

That's exactly what we have here.

It's clear,

14

it seems to me, that Congress intended trustees to get

15

equitable relief, declaratory judgments, injunctive

16

relief, and did not specifically address the issue of

17

tax laws, although they must have realized tax laws were

18

one possible area of preemption, and applying the Tax

19

Injunction Act to prevent them from getting that kind of

20

relief in this case would frustrate the clear

21

Congressional intent to permit them to get instruction

22

from the federal courts about how to properly operate

23

the trust under ERISA.

24
25

QUESTIONi

Well, Mr. Watson, perhaps Congress

thought that tax laws weren’t preempted.

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. WATSON

1

That’s another possibility, Your

2

Honor.

3

the contrary, and although this gets into my preemption

4

argument, it’s clear from the preemption statute itself,

5

which contains its own exceptions for banking laws,

6

insurance laws, securities laws, it doesn’t mention tax

7

laws and it doesn't mention state levies, and it

8

certainly doesn’t mention individual creditors, even if

9

they are individual government bodies acting as

10
11

Rut the legislative history suggests strongly to

creditors.
That isn’t in the statute, and, as counsel for

12

the state pointed out,

13

amended, after the Ninth Circuit ruled in this case.

14

Congress wanted to change this statute and say, the

15

Ninth Circuit made a mistake, we want to make it clear

16

that state levy laws — not tax laws now, but levy laws,

17

because that's what we're talking about here — are not

18

preempted, they could have added that in when they

19

amended 514 this year.

20

the statute has recently been
If

They did not do so, and this Court in the has

21

dealt with the issue of Congressional silence in a way

22

which I think would suggest in this case that, even if

23

Congress didn't know in 1974 that they were preempting

24

state levy laws, they surely must know now.

25

course, there’s been litigation in other courts about

this mattae also indicating that ERISA preemption is

2

very broad.
So surely the Congressional intent is tacitly

3
4

in the record.

Moreover, there is copious and I think

5

even redundant quotes from the sponsors of the original

6

ERISft bill set forth in tha briefs which show how

7

broadly they felt the preemption statute was to be

8

read.
They did not suggest that all common law

9

10

remedies would never apply to the trust funds, but they

11

did suggest, as in the collective bargaining cases, like

12

Lincoln Kills and Aero Lodge and cases of that kind,

13

that a federal common law would be developed by the

14

federal court to govern this type of situation, and

15

exactly that type of thing ought to be done in the

16

debtor-creditor type situation we have here.
We’re not saying that federal courts might not

17
18

develop a federal common law authorized by ERISA that

19

would permit some kind of levy in the future.

hasn't been done yet and it can't be done under state

law.

22

But that

That's our main point.
QUESTION;

Kay I ask, before you get too far

23

away from the jurisdictional question, on the question

24

of an adequate state California remedy, are you telling

25

me that, supposing the state had levied, had a case of

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

mistaken identity, foe example, that a person that they

2

said owed them taxes was not really a beneficiary of the

3

trust or something like that — wouldn't the trustees

4

have a remedy in resisting the levy in some state

5

proceeding that would be prompt and efficient?
HR. WATSON;

6

Well, I know of no reported state

7

case that addresses the issue as Your Honor has framed

8

it, but the statute refers to the taxpayer as having the

9

remedy.

Now, I concede to the Court that probably when

10

the California statute was drafted nobody thought about

11

trust funds like this, but they surely must have thought

12

about third party creditors the state might be chasing

13

after in order to collect tax funds, and apparently they

14

decided to leave it up to the taxpayer to fight his own

15

battle.

16

QUESTION;

Well, let me just be sure I

17

understand your position.

18

fact that the trustee would have a prompt and adequate

19

state remedy to determine whether or not it had any

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that would enable the trustee to question a levy of this

2

kind?
MR. WATSON;

3

I'm saying — I'm saying to the

4

Court that the specific statutory proceeding which is

5

provided is apparently the exclusive remedy, and I'm

6

quite clear that the Board would take the position that

7

the trust doesn't have the standing to come into court

8

and say, wait a minute, Mr. Zarate doesn't owe this tax,

9

and that in effect it's none of the trust fund's

10

business as long as the trust fund holds assets payable

11

to Mr. Zarate, he being one of the taxpayers in this

12

case.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Do you think that the duty of the

trustee always would be just to pay over the money?
ME. WATSON;

such a way as to require the taxpayer to fight his own

9

MR. WATSON:

And frankly, if we took just an

the protections the statute gives them if they pay the

money to the state and given the judicial process the

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. WATSON:

25

Yes, and I don’t follow that.
Is that the theory?
I don't follow that.

One of the

difficulties in this case is that the state has raised

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

the Tax Injunction Act in its reply brief filed just one
week ago, so the Board does not have the benefit of full
briefs from both parties on that.

Had it been raised in

the original brief, I would have addressed the matter in
detail, and some of the questions that Justice Stevens
has asked suggest that perhaps the matter ought to be
looked into in greater detail.
Let me pass, if I might, though, to a second
important reason why federal question jurisdiction ought
e

to exist here.

As I mentioned a moment ago in response

to one of Justice Marshall's questions, it's clear at
least under Ninth Circuit law that this trust agreement
is a collective bargaining agreemen.
the employers and the union.

It was signed by

It is part and parcel of

the collective bargaining process.
This Court has made it clear in Section 301
suits, in Avco and Boys Market and other suits, that the
federal interest in the collective bargaining process is
pervasive and, even when such suits on common law
theories are brought in state courts under Section 301,
they can be removed by the defendant party to federal
court and once in federal court they must stay there.
That's in the Aero case and that's cited in our brief.
This same overwhelming federal interest is
present in this case, not only because this is a form of

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

collective bargaining agreement, but also because of the

2

very comprehensive umbrella of ERISA and the very clear

3

statements in the legislative history and in Section 502

4

that Congress wanted these questions resolved in federal

5

courts.
Now, there's a third reason why federal

6
7

question jurisdiction exists here, I believe.

In 1974

8

in the Oneida case this Court held federal question

9

jurisdiction to exist in a suit brought under a simple

10

common law ejectment theory in New York by an Indian

11

tribe, because the Court found that inevitably the

federal question would arise.

21

no other question in the case.

22

In this case the federal question isn't
There is

The trustees have no other defense to the

23

payment of these moneys, we don't know whether these

taxpayers owe the money, and the state of California

QUESTION;

9
10

In the case

You couldn't take the property

taxes out of that money if there was no other money?
MR. WATSON;

11

No, it's quite clear to me that

12

the trust as a general debtor itself in the state of

13

California would not have a special position, although

14

the Heffernan case from Connecticut does suggest that

15

direct taxes on the trust fund may be preempted by

16

ERISA, special taxes directed just at trust assets.
But if the trust owns real estate and is

17
18

subject to property taxes, I do not believe that the

19

ERISA preemption provision, which says that it preempts

20

statutes which indirectly regulate these trust funds, as

21

this kind of levy would by taking away the benefits

22

payable to the individuals -- that's simply not the same

23

thing.

24
25

Here there’s a very real risk of depleting
trust fund assets that were set aside for another

I might comment that the problem is not made

3

simpler by the fact that this is a state agency.

An

4

Ohio district court, in an opinion cited in the state's

5

brief, has found that general creditors can invade this

trust.

7

And I might also comment that, although we

8

realize as we stand before you today that a vacation

9

trust does not seem by its very essence to be a very

10

important kind of trust fund, the Court must understand

11

that Congress treats the vacation trust in the same way

MR. WATSON:

6

That is true, Your Honor, that is

true.

However, the removal statute provides that cases

9

which are arising under federal law may be removed.

since the preemption issue we believe furnishes the

MR. WATSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

Court:

10

I would like now to move to the preemption

phase of the case in the remaining ten minutes of my

13

opinions for this Court, the primary source for

14

interpreting the statute is the statute itself.

15

case, we believe the provisions of the statute, both the

16

preemption provision and Section 403, which limits the

17

right of the trustees as fiduciaries to spend money for

18

the purposes set forth in the trust agreement and for

19

the reasonable costs of defraying trust expenses, are

20

very, very clear.

The state suggests that, as in the marital

1

2

dissolution cases, there ought to be some kind of

3

implicit exception for state tax levies.

4

state courts and some federal courts have found such an

5

exception in cases where pension benefits and other

6

benefits had to be divided between former spouses to a

7

dissolved marriage, and they say, why not us as well.

8

And we think there are two answers to that:

They say that

9

One, it is not clear from the opinions of this Court

10

that the marital dissolution cases are correct.

11

Although this Court summarily dismissed the Campa case

12

for want of a substantial federal question, there is no

13

authoritative opinion of this Court approving the

14

reasoning of the lower court decisions in the marital

15

dissolution cases.
Second, as was brought out in the colloquy

16
17

between counsel for the state and one of the members of

18

this Court, there is a distinct difference between

19

dividing benefits among co-beneficiaries of one of these

trust funds and giving those intended benefits to a

21

creditor.

concerned?

QUESTION*

1

Well, the significant difference as

2

far as this case is concerned is that it can be argued,

3

ani

4

that the purpose of the trust instrument is met when you

5

give the benefits to co-beneficiaries, a husband and

6

wife, particularly in a community property state where

7

they jointly own the whole community property, with

8

California as a community property state.

9

I say not necessarily rightly, but it can be argued,

When you give the benefits to a third party

10

creditor not interested in benefits under the trust

11

fund, simply trying to latch onto those assets to

12

satisfy some alleged debt incurred by one of the

13

beneficiaries, you are defeating the purpose of the

14

trust in a way you are not doing when you give the

15

benefits to another person, a spouse, a husband or a

16

wife, who shares those benefits under California law

17

with the named beneficiary under the trust fund.

18

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose if there were a

19

levy on a life insurance policy that had a large cash

20

value and a lot of beneficiaries in a community property

21

state, it wouldn’t be any different, would it?

22

MR. WATSON*

23

QUESTION*

Well —
Is there any barrier to a creditor

24

levying on the cash value of a life insurance policy in

25

California?

There could be federal legislation on that at some time

in the future, but absent that there would be no

argument in a federal court on it like there is today.

QUESTIONi

Would you be making the same

argument if all these events occurred after
MR. WATSON;

3

Oh,

yes,

1982?

I definitely would.

If

4

the Court is asking, do the new amendments to the

5

statute affect the outcome of this case in any way, I

6

would say the only way in which they do so is to make it

7

clear that Congress was satisfied with the result the

8

Ninth Circuit reached in this case.
It is not unusual, as the Court knows from the

9

10

Kaiser-Mullins case, for Congress to comment on

11

decisions by the Court of Appeals and lower federal

12

courts, and the legislative history in Kaiser-Kullins,

13

many lower court decisions are cited.
This legislation, which was passed and signed

14
15

just in January of this year, six months after this

16

decision was issued, two years after the Heffernan

17

delinquent, contains no indication that Congress was

18

dissa tisfied.
QUESTION;

19

20

Do you think the '82 amendment just

confirmed the meaning of the prior law?
MR. WATSON;

21

I do. Your Honor.

I do think

22

that.

I think that in attacking the Agsalud problem and

23

leaving this problem alone, Congress was telling this

24

Court and other courts that it is satisfied with the

25

preemption results being reached by lower courts.

-- it just didn't disturb whatever the law was.
HR. WATSON;

3

That's exactly right, yes.

I am

not representing to the Court that the legislative

5

history specifically says, we think the result the Ninth

6

Circuit reached in this case is a good one.

HR. WATSON;

QUESTION;

It didn't change it, that's

-- didn't purport to change what

the law was or anything of the kind.
HR. WATSON;

13
14

That's exactly right.

That’s

exactly right.
Prior to the break Justice Marshall had asked

15
16

why it would be that the trust would have to pay

17

property taxes but would not have to pay this kind of

18

levy.

19

20

trust assets for the purposes described in the trust

21

document and also for defraying the expenses of

22

operating the trust.

exactly right.

11
12

So it didn't really change, the

amendment --

10

But by —

The simple answer to that is in Section 403 of

Having a building, hiring employees, paying

24

the taxes incurred in operating the trust, those are

25

clearly permissible purposes.

QUESTION:

That's right.

6

MR. WATSON:

7

Those are clearly permissible purposes,

That's correct.

8

however, that don't raise the preemption problem here.

9

Finally, if I may turn to one other question

10

that was raised before the break, Justice Stevens had

11

asked, well, couldn't the trustees get some kind of

12

remedy in state court using some kind of common law

13

theory.

14

has the remedy, surely the trustees can go in and

15

challenge this whole setup.

16

Even if the statute provides only the taxpayer

The quick answer to that, and it gets us back

17

to the jurisdictional issue, is that Section 502

18

requires that the trustees,

19

from the court about their fiduciary responsibilities or

20

their responsibilities under ERISA, it requires that

21

those suits be brought in federal court.

22

when they seek instruction

So if the trustees in this case had brought

23

their own suit against the state in state court, the

24

state would have had a total defense:

25

simply does not have jurisdiction.

the state court

Again, it gets us

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

back to why this must be a federal court case.
Finally, and I will conclude on this point,

2
3

the state has suggested, in referring to the marital

4

dissolution cases, that there’s that implicit exception

5

in the Act; perhaps, as some lower courts have stated

6

and suggested, other high public purposes deserve an

7

equal exemption.
My response to that is simply, there is

8
9

nothing in the legislative history to suggest that

10

Congress intended that every high public purpose would

11

create an implicit exemption to the very clear

12

preemption statute.
A second response to that is*

13

How many high

14

public purposes are there and who is to decide what they

15

are?

16

on trust assets to satisfy tax delinquencies of the

17

beneficiaries is a high public purpose, we will see many

18

more cases before this Court and lower courts where

19

people are asserting that their purposes are equally

20

worthy.

If the Court goes along with the idea that levying

That is surely not what the framers of the Act

21

22

intended.

It is very foreign to the purpose of the

23

ERISA statute.

24

I thank the Court.

25

QUESTION*

Mr. Watson, let me be sure I

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

understood your answer to my other question

2

the requirement that the trustees must proceed in

3

federal court?
SR. WATSONs

4
5

Where is

The requirement is in Section

502(a)(3) and 502(e) of the Act.

6

QUESTION:

Of ERISA?

7

MR. WATSONi

Of ERLSA.

It provides that the

8

trustees may bring an action seeking equitable or other

9

relief, including injunctive relief — which gets us to

10

the Tax Injunction Act problem, as it may conflict in

11

this language with that — to determine their rights and

12

obligations under the trust instrument or under ERISA

13

itself.
Now, in the case Your Honor posited the only

14
15

defense the trustees have, the only one we’re asserting

16

here, is that ERISA prevents us from paying out this

17

money to third party creditors.

18

kind of suit, exactly the kind of question, that Section

19

502(e) says federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction

20

of.

21

at that kind of critical issue under ERISA despite the

22

exclusive jurisdiction language in the statute, the

23

whole purpose of the statute, to keep these very

24

sensitive questions in federal court, would be

completely frustrated.

I'm saying that, regardless of

9

That the absence of the adequate

10

state remedy, if I understand your argument, is because

11

there’s a provision in ERISA which preempts what might

12

otherwise be a state remedy?
SR. WATSON;

13

Yes.

I am saying that, whether

14

the trustees call the lawsuit a cow or a pony, whether

15

they say it’s a state court declaratory relief action or

16

under some state common law theory like conversion, it's

17

clear that what they're really looking for is

instruction about how to operate under their fiduciary
