ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. BISHOP;

8
9

Hr. Bishop, you may proceed whenever

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
This appeal involves a suit to determine the

10
11

ownership of a 1978 new Piper Navajo airplane sold to

12

both parties in the suit by a fraudulent dealer.

13

Plaintiff Shacket brought suit in the U.S. district

14

court for a declaratory judgment seeking a determination

15

of the ownership of the Piper Navajo airplane in him.

16

The Defendant Piper Navajo counterclaimed against

17

Sha cket.
As to the ownership of the aircraft, the

18
19

district court awarded ownership to the Plaintiff

20

Shacket.

21

wrongful conversion, and requests for damages, and all

22

of those counts were held by the lower court against the

23

party making the claim.

24
25

There were other counts of fraud, conspiracy,

of Appeals and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals

6

affirmed the judgment of the U.S. district court.

7

Philko subsequently petitioned to this honorable Court

8

by writ of certiorari and that certiorari was granted,

9

but limited to the first issue presented by the

10

Petitioner Philko as to the question presented*

12

transfer of possession alone, without the necessity of

13

Does

Both the Plaintiff Shacket and Philko through

14
15

Mr. Edward J. McArdle, its president, had had prior

16

dealings, not directly related to this lawsuit, with

17

Roger Smith or Smith Aviation, Inc., the dealer

involved.

20

became apprised of the availability for purchase of a

3

fixed base operation at Aurora Municipal Airport in

Aurora, Illinois, and subsequently formed a new Delaware

corporation called Philko to buy the assets of Philko

Aviation in Aurora.

He then leased that facility to Soger Smith

8

Aircraft Sales, Inc., and Soger Smith Aircraft Sales,

11

under the name Soger Smith Aircraft Sales, Inc.

The delivery was to be in early 1978.
In April 19th of 1978, Shacket, after being

18
19

advised the plane was then ready for delivery, appeared

20

at Aurora Airport from his home in Detroit preparatory

21

to closing and taking possession of the aircraft.

22

that time Mr. Shacket paid an additional $106,000 in

23

cash and he had at a prior time given up possession to a

24

1972 Piper Navajo airplane which was to be used as the

25

tradein.

QUESTIONi

Mr. Bishop.

8

MR. BISHOP;

9

QUESTION*

Sir?
Do you think all of these facts are

10

really essential to resolve the legal issue presented in

11

the petition for certiorari?

12

MR. BISHOP;

Yes, sir.

13

Mr. Shacket took possession of the airplane

14

after being shown copies of the title iocuments

15

conveying title from Piper in a complete chain up to and

16

including Smith Aviation, Inc.

17

through Roger Smith, provided him with a buyer's copy of

18

the bill of sale conveying from Smith Aviation to

19

Maurice Shacket.

Smith Aviation, Inc.,

Maurice Shacket had asked for the original

20
21

iocuments.

He was toll that they weren't ready.

He

22

returned to Detroit, but left his friend Mr. Hamburg,

23

who was staying a day later, to bring the copy.

24

same story was told to Mr. Hamburg, who did not get the

25

original documents necessary for filing with the FAA.

The

1

Next lay, on or about April 20th, Mr. Smith

2

takes all of the original documents necessary to file

3

with the FAA and presents them to Mr. McArdle, with the

4

story that he was going to try to borrow $151,000 on the

5

aircraft, but it was exceeding his line of credit.

6

McArdle declined through his corporation to extend any

7

further credit to Roger Smith Aircraft, but did agree

8

ultimately to buy the aircraft.

Mr.

He bought the aircraft by paying $152,000 in

9

10

cash and cancelling an antecedent debt of $60,000, which

11

had not yet become due but which was shortly to become

2

due.

3

who was the provider of the $152,000 cash and was going

4

to make the loan on the aircraft, inspected the

5

documents, determined them to be valid documents, had

6

checked with the FAA recording facility in Oklahoma

7

City, determined that the Piper aircraft had been

8

manufactured and that there were no intervening title

9

interests.

20

Mr. McArdle did so, however, only after his bank,

At that point Mr. McArdle authorized the

2

disbursement of funds for the loan to be delivered to or

22

for the account of Roger Smith Aircraft Sales.

23

QUESTION*

Are you repeating all these facts

24

to demonstrate or persuade us that we’re confronted with

25

two bona fide purchasers here?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

MR. BISHOP:

1

Well, we have a slight

2

difference, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice.

3

perhaps a buyer in the ordinary course under the UCC.

4

Philko was a purchaser, a good faith purchaser for

5

value.

6

Justice, is one uses an antecedent debt as part of the

7

consideration.

10

The difference being under our UCC, Mr. Chief

At any rate, the documents were duly filed

8
9

Shacket was

with the FAA on or about May 31st.

They were noted as

filed for record.
About June, mid-June, Shacket had found out of

11
12

McArdle's interest, and that was the first contact Mr.

13

McArdle had or was aware of Shacket's involvement in the

14

tra nsaction.
QUESTION:

15
16
17

Shacket had the airplane, didn't

he?
MR. BISHOP:

Yes, sir.

He took possession of

18

the airplane at the time he paid his money.

19

was told that the aircraft was in Michigan with a Piper

20

dealer being fitted with avionics.

21

Mr. McArdle

We have here, then, a conflict between the

22

Illinois Uniform Commercial Code and the federal

23

recording statute.

24
25

QUESTION:

Section 49 U.S.C -You agree that, except for the

federal law, the right result was reached below?

8

MR. BISHOP*

1

2

I'm sorry?

I didn't hear your

question.
QUESTION*

3

If there were no federal recording

4

statute, the result reached below would be correct in

5

your view?

6

MR. BISHOP;

7

QUESTION*

8

11
12
13

At least it wouldn't concern us,

because it would be a matter of state law.
MR. BISHOP*

9

10

Not entirely. Your Honor.

That is correct, that is

correct .
QUESTION*

So your focus is on the impact of

the federal statute.
MR. BISHOP*

That is correct, yes, sir.

The

14

federal statute says under 1403 that no document will be

15

accorded validity as to third parties without notice

16

unless and until it is filed for record.

17

filed his interest for record.

18

looking at the FAA records through its bank, finds no

19

intervening interest, has all of the original documents

20

in its hands, duly files them with the EAA.

21

Shacket never

McArdle or Philko,

Plaintiff — Shacket makes the allegation,

22

well, even if we had sent them down for recording you

23

would not have known in time.

24

question, because if they'd been sent down for proper

25

recording at Oklahoma City you wouldn’t have had the

But that really begs the

1

documents in Smith’s hands to perpetrate the fraud in

2

Philko.

3

So we have an interplay here of two statutes,

4

one under the Illinois Uniform Commercial Code that

5

would purport to pass title by possession of the

6

document, and the enactment of 1401 and

7

require the registration of an owner of aircraft, and

8

upon that registration under 1401 either having the

9

document recorded under 1403 or having recordable

10
11

1403 which

documents under 1403.
Shacket takes the position that if you look at

12

1406 you are directed to the state law in which the

13

document is delivered.

14

solve a problem that dealt with the choice of law to

15

determine the respective rights or validities of the

16

parties of the contract.

1406 was enacted in 1964 to

17

That is to say that you had a choice of where

18

the aircraft was located, you had a choice of the place

19

of execution or place of delivery.

20

we think, chose the place of delivery of the document as

21

the most logical choice for highly mobile, highly

22

valuable pieces of machinery, where often consortiums of

23

lenders, 60 or more, get together.

24
25

1406, appropriately,

One reads the Congressional Record and you
come away with the inescapable conclusion that, in their

10

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

analysis of enacting 1406, they are viewing 1406 as a

2

choice of law, a federal choice of law as to the parties

3

to that agreement to determine validity.
QUESTION:

4

Hell, Mr. Eishop, I think you've

5

got some problems in your argument with the language of

6

Section 1406.

7

the recording of which is provided for by section 503 .

8

. . shall be governed by the laws of the state.”

9

why shouldn't the UCC govern as to priorities under that

10

It says "the validity of any instrument

Now,

section ?
MR. BISHOP;

11

Well, it's a question I think

12

where we have our problem, Mr. Justice, is that if you

13

have resort to state law for substantive ownership

14

rights, you've gone beyond the scope of 1406.

15

determination of validity is, quite properly I think,

16

limited to the execution:

17

properly describe the asset, does it meet the test of

18

that jurisdiction in which it's delivered, and, analyzed

19

from the two parties that are involved in that

20

particular instrument, does it meet the test as a valid

21

instrument?

The

Is it proper, does it

Obviously, you must have some machinery to

22
23

eliminate fraudulent acts.

But the minute you logically

24

extend

25

you *re giving credence to a tran sf er of ownership, if

1406 into the su b st a ntive law of the state, now

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

you will, without having recorded it under 1403.

And

2

1403 says no interest in any aircraft will be valid

3

unless recorded in 1403.
So 1406 can't be used to bypass the effect of

4

S

recording under 1403 without making 1403 almost a

6

useless tool.

7

for the Government and for the aviation industry a

8

rather neat set of rules whereby lenders could take some

9

comfort in the status of title;

The object of recording was to provide

whereby investment

10

capital would flow in in such a way that lenders or

11

investors would be reasonably certain to have an

12

interest in the specific chattel that they're looking

13

at; and so that the Government would be empowered to

14

send out notices to owners of defects discovered by the

15

Federal Aviation Administration.

16

if —

17

QUESTION:

And how could it do it

Mr. Bishop, you would agree, would

18

you not, that because of 1406 that the validity of the

19

instruments describing the second transaction, which

20

were in fact recorded, are governed by Illinois law

21

because of 1406?

22

MR. BISHOP:

Yes, sir, and there is no dispute

23

that those documents are properly executed under

24

Illinois law and that they are the original documents to

25

the transactions that they purport to represent.

That's

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

in the record. Your Honor.
But the validity of those documents does not

2
3

mean that you allow the substantive state law to operate

4

beyond the parties to those instruments or beyond the

5

scope of them to divest what would appear to be the

6

titleholder.

That

is to say, any right affecting aircraft mus t be, if it

11

is going to enjoy validity, it must be reco rded under

13

There is no interplay —

14

QUESTION;

Well, that's a slight

15

overstatement, isn't it, Mr. Bishop?

16

to the parties to the transaction and all persons who

17

have actual notice of the transaction?

MR. BISHOP;

QUESTION;

MR. BISHOP;

22

Isn't it valid as

Yes, sir.
Even if it’s not recorded.
In this context, I mean third

QUESTION;

So that if it should develop that

23

the relationship between your client and the fraudulent

dealer was such that your client should be deemed to

25

have been on actual notice, then you would be bound?

MR. BISHOP;

The result would he otherwise,

that is quite correct, sir.
The notice — returning to 1406,

3

1406 can only

because if you don't have a document under 1403 it isn’t

a useless recording statute, because some items would be

MR. BISHOP;

We are saying that this 1403 is

not framed in language -QUESTION;

Your client wouldn't be in the fix

he is if Shacket had filed his papers.
MR. BISHOP;

That's quite so.

It may even go

22

further than that.

If Shacket had just taken the

23

photocopies that he had and made them part of the

24

record, he might have itiuddied the waters sufficient to

25

have alerted a wary person.

15

ALDERSON REPORTINQ COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

But the requirements of 1403, Mr. Justice, are

2

that you must file the original documents.

3

documents are what Eoger Smith delivered to Mr. KcArdle

4

and Mr. McArdle on behalf of Philko delivered to the

5

Sandwich State Bank.

6

record as to those documents.

7

The original

And there is no dispute in the

If you look at 1403, it is to advise the wide

8

world of the recorded status or title or security

9

interest in an aircraft.

1406 was an attempt by

10

Congress, and I think a very excellent attempt, to

11

develop a choice of forum so that — not a choice of

12

forum, but a choice, a federal choice of law so that you

13

could determine the validity of a document.

14

They examined in the Congressional

15

deliberations at great length what the alternatives were

16

and gave some almost scary examples of the problems

17

engendered with, say, a small airline fleet flying over

18

the country, trying to make a mortgage with a consortium

19

of banks out of New York.

20

They discussed the problems with analyzing the

21

transaction from the location of the aircraft, some of

22

which were in the air and operational at the time, and

23

the choice of law keyed into the point of execution, but

24

often you have multiple signers of a document in

25

different locations, and finally came to the resolution

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that the one thing that generally happened to any

2

document about one time was its delivery/ and it wasn't

3

an effective instrument in most every jurisdiction until

4

delivery.

5

So 1406 very correctly selected the place of

6

delivery as the federal choice of law to determine the

7

validity of the document.
QUESTION;

8
9

Mr. Bishop, I am concerned by the

legislative history, which you have not really

10

mentioned.

The original Senate bill contained a clear

11

provision saying that every instrument so recorded will

12

have priority over all other claims arising afterwards.

13

The Congress knew how to draft language that would have

14

clearly required priority effect here and that language

15

was dropped from the legislation.
And in the maritime bill Congress clearly

16
17

provided for priorities.

In the motor vehicle

18

registration it did not.

It had the language to do it

19

here and took it out.

MR. EISHOPi

Then it seems to me you would

Well, I think you have, as we

11

suggested in our brief, Mr. Justice, a race-notice

12

statute. From the original enactment of 1403, which

13

originally provided for validity upon recordation, that

14

was subsequently changed in 1940 -- 1976, to be keyed

15

into the filing for record, rather than recording, and

16

mandated the FAA to keep a register of all documents

17

filed for record.

18

Now, it would seem not really important unless

19

it was in Congress' mind to establish a priority of the

20

filing of documents.

21

that, we're going to establish a priority, but the

that the statutory language expressly says that you look

to the validity of the document without regard to the

11

vanity number aircraft, flew it off from Aurora Airport

12

and flew it to Detroit, and he has been in possession of

13

that aircraft since that time.

14

The third fact that this Court has to look at

15

is that the district court and the Court of Appeals,

16

based upon this record, determined that my clients had

17

title interest in this aircraft under state law under

two separate theories:

Bishop is correct, he did give value under the

But what he didn't tell you is the fact that

Those are the essential --

QUESTION:

Mr. Murray, is it not possible

19

that, even though the second purchaser wasn't a

20

purchaser under Illinois law, that either he or the bank

21

had a security interest in the claim?

22

ruling on that question?
MR. MURRAY:

23

There's been no

There has been no ruling.

And to

24

answer your question, Justice Stevens, I do not believe

25

so.

Under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code —

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

and that issue was not raised

2

QUESTION

No, but if it hasn't yet been

3

decided don’t we have to, for purposes of analyzing the

4

federal statute, at least consider that one possibility

5

is that the second purchaser did acquire a security

6

interest in the plane?
MR. MURRAY:

7
8

Yes, I'm not disagreeing with

y ou.
QUESTION:

9

And then you’d have to decide

10

whether such a security interest would be valid as

11

against a prior unrecorded transaction, assuming that

12

the security interest person did not have notice.
MR. MURRAY:

13

That’s correct.

And I would ask

14

-- and I would suggest to you, Justice Stevens, that you

15

would have to focus your attention on whether or not

16

this secured party who took an interest in an aircraft,

17

whether or not — as you know, under the Code you have

18

certain elements in order for a security interest to

19

a ttach.

20

One of those interests is that your borrower

21

has a proprietary interest in the aircraft.

Their

22

interest is predicated on the bill of sale between

23

Philko Aviation and Roger Smith Aircraft Sales.

24

Illinois law it is clear under the Uniform Commercial

25

Code that that conveyance -- that Roger Smith had

Under

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

nothing to convsy under that instrument, and there was

2

nothing to convey.

3

QUESTION;

Well, you may be entirely right,

4

but all I’m suggesting is that it has not yet been

5

decided whether the second purchaser got a security

6

interest, because the district court didn't really

7

address that.

8

MR. MURRAY:

9

QUESTION:

That's absolutely correct.
And it seems to me that we have to

10

assume that possibility in order to resolve the proper

11

construction of the federal statute, that it is at least

12

possible that on remand, because we have a summary

13

judgment situation —

14

MR. MURRAY:

15

QUESTION;

That's correct.
— that a trial would show there

16

was a security interest.

17

would the federal statute protect that security interest

18

against a prior unrecorded sale of the aircraft?

19

MR. MURRAY:

And then the question is,

And I don't — first of all, if

20

you're suggesting that this case, in order for that

21

issue to be determined, should be remanded for further

22

consideration, I would suggest to you. Justice Stevens,

23

that that is unnecessary, because all the facts in this

24

case are in the record.

25

QUESTION;

And my analysis —

Normally we don't decide questions

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1
2

of state law, is all I'm suggesting.
MR. MURRAY:

I agree with you, and I'm not

3

suggesting that you should decide it.

4

but you had suggested, Justice Stevens, that that issue

5

might be critical to your determination as far as,

6

although this looks like an absolute title situation,

7

under old common law mortgages under the absolute deed

8

types of cases, which were taken solely for security

9

purposes, were given some effect.

10

But if that —

And all I'm suggesting to you, Justice

11

Stevens, is that when you look at Article 9 and what is

12

required for purposes of creating a security interest,

13

and based on the facts in this case, it is clear that

14

Philko Aviation would not take a security interest.

15

That's all I'm saying.

16

QUESTION:

Well, even if that's true, what

17

that means is that even if you lose the battle here you

18

may win the war.

19

MR. MURRAY:

That's correct.

20

Those are the four factors that this Court

21

should consider with respect to its interpretation of a

22

federal statute, 1403.

23

interpret this statute as not only preempting state law

24

with respect to recording statutes, but also the

25

substantive legal rights.

This Court is called upon to

this statute in such a way as to strip my client of his

rights in his new aircraft, those rights which would be

recognized and upheld in virtually every single state of

5

the Union.
QUESTIONS

6

Well, I suppose Philko claims that

7

it's being stripped of its rights to its new aircraft.

8

I mean, both of the parties probably have equities.
NR. MURRAY*

9

I’m not suggesting, Justice

10

Rehnquist, that both parties do not have equities.

I am

11

not suggesting that at all.

12

is, is that under this particular factual situation the

13

equities lie with my client, because I do not believe

14

Congress intended 1403 to preempt state law substantive

15

title questions.

I am suggesting the fact

I will agree that Congress intended to preempt

16
17

state recording laws, and that I would agree.

18

respect to state substantive title questions, I would

19

disagree.

contained in the remark you just made, I think, isn’t

it?

— with respect to two people, each

with presumably very substantial equities.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. MURRAY*

1

That's correct, Justice

2

Rehnquist.

3

preempts only state recording laws and does not affect

4

the substantive ownership of title interests.

5

fact of recording does not legitimize an invalid

6

conveyance or a parpocted ownership interest, and there

7

is no question that under state law Philko did not have

8

a legitimate interest.

9

And it is our position that Section 5C3

The mere

Philko claims to have a superior right in this

10

aircraft by virtue of recording of a bill of sale.

11

under state law it has no interest to record because

12

Smith, Roger Smith, had no interest to convey and having

13

already sold the aircraft to a bona fide purchaser for

14

value and a buyer in the ordinary course.

15

of the statute clearly preempts state recording

16

statutes, but it does not, as Petitioner suggests, go

17

further and preempt state law as to the ownership

18

interest and priorities.

19

QUESTION*

Yet,

The language

But isn't your argument that there

20

was no interest to convey at the time it was conveyed,

21

isn't that essentially based on a recording statute

22

rather than a substantive law?

MR. MURRAY*

No, it's not. Justice Rehnquist.

24

I do not believe that my — my client's rights are not

based upon this recording statute.

especially in the secured party situation, that a buyer

in the ordinary course will take priority over a secured

creditor if he takes from a merchant.

6

Even if the buyer in the ordinary course

7

checks with the secretary, in our state, the secretary

of state’s office and determines that there’s a

MR. MURRAY:

intent, the first thing we look at is the statute

doesn’t that have some substantive bite?

6

You say that that word '’valid" just

has no force at all.

7

MR. MURRAY;

QUESTION:

9

No,

I’m just saying --

That you have to look to state law

for every substantive consequence of the filing?
MR. MURRAY:

10

As it relates to title, that's

11

correct.

12

versus General Dynamics case says that the literal

13

interpretation wouli lead to a ridiculous result and

14

could create unenforceable interests without giving

value, simply by recording.

16

In fact, Justice Wisdom in the Gary Aircraft

For example, if, rather than giving fair

17

consideration, there was no consideration and that the

18

bill of sale between Philko, Philko Aviation and Roger

Smith was properly executed under an Illinois law, but

20

there was no consideration, and if it was filed with the

21

county recorder, under the Petitioner’s interpretation

22

that would have validity.

If for example — and

I’m not saying this is

the case, but it does demonstrate a ridiculous result

5

Hell,

fact that state law controls the meaning and validity of

Well, Mr. Andrews, when asked why he

20

waited 30 days to record the bill of sale, it is because

21

of the fact that it takes time in which to record.

various types of interests.

as far as the FAA's position, is that it's not going to

MR. MURRAY:

Yes, I would. Justice O'Connor.

15

My analysis of that statute is that all that -- or that

treaty, the Mortgage Convention Act — and all I can

17

give you, Justice O’Connor, is my reading of the

18

Mortgage Convention Act — under Article 1, paragraph 2,

19

makes clear that each contracting state’s substantive

20

law will control rights in an aircraft.
There is no need to adopt a uniform national

21
22

law.

Article 17 of the Mortgage Convention permits

23

contract states to reference the law of territories.

24

And I must admit, my interpretation of the law of

25

territories would be analogous to the law of the
