ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. MARTIN:

7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

And may it please the Court:
October of 1976 the Interstate Commerce

Mr. Martin, I think you

Commission prescribed a rate of $10.93 per ton

10

applicable on coal moving from Wyoming to San Antonio,

11

Texas.

12

was an interim measure to get the coal moving.

13

Eighth Circuit sustained it, in part, on the basis that

14

it was temporary.

15

Its action in the so-called San Antonio I case
And the

Now, in reopening the 1973 the Commission in

16

the San Antonio II case modified its prior order by

17

eliminating the prior rate prescription and imposing a

18

rate ceiling of $16.12 a ton.

19

prescription of a particular rate but a ceiling? that is

20

to say, a maximum level.

21

0.18 of the appendix makes it clear and says, "It is not

22

in any sense a requirement that the railroads increase

23

their rates on this traffic to any particular level."

24
25

This is not the

The Commission's decision at

Following that decision the railroads aid in
fact file a tariff at the $16.12 level.

Than on petition for administrative review in

2

1979 in San Antonio III* the Commission modified its

3

decision and sat a higher rate ceiling of $17.23.

4

Now* it should be noted that the railroad's

5

o Is ligation to collect and the shipper's obligation to

6

pay the rate derives not from the Commission's order

7

establishing any particular ceiling but from the fact

8

that the rate was filed in a tariff with the Interstate

9

Commerce Commission.

If the tariff were less than the

10

ceiling* then the tariff is what the shipper would pay*

11

not the ceiling.
Now* following San Antonio III* the railroads

12
13

sought review in the Court of Appeals in the D.C.

14

Circuit on the ground that the ceiling was arbitrary,

15

capricious, and unlawfully low.

16

appealed, contending that the decision was arbitrary and

17

that the rate that resulted was too high.

And San Antonio also

The D.C. Circuit in its first decision in June

18
19

of 1980 concluded that the Commission's San Antonio III

rate ceiling was arbitrary* it lacked adequate

rationale, and the cost findings were not adequately

supported.

1

Commission to lift the 1976 prescription was proper.

2

The only question was the validity of the new ceiling

3

and whether it uuas rationally supported.

4

No w, after the Court of Appeals decision and

5

commencing with shipments moving on July 24, 1980, San

6

Antonio quit paying the tariff rate and commenced paying

7

at a level of 115.83 a ton, which it calculated to be

8

the old 1976 interim prescription increased by general

9

rate increases that had occurred since that time.

And

10

from July 24, 1980, to May 7 of 1981, when they resumed

11

paying at the tariff level, the difference between the

12

tariff that was in effect and on file at the Commission

13

and the rates that they actually paid amounted to

14

approximately $20 million.
Now, after they quit paying at the tariff

15
16

level and after other attempts to compel them to pay at

17

that level failed, the railroads petitioned the O.C.

18

Circuit to clarify that its decision with respect to the

19

ICC orders in San Antonio II and III did not affect the

20

railroads' tariffs that were on file at the Commission.
QUESTION:

21

Do

you have any regrets in having

22

made that decision to petition for clarification, Mr.

23

Martin?

24
25

MR. MARTIN:

Well, I think not, because we

were in a position in the fall in which we were not

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

getting our tariffs paid, and u/e had to do something to

2

clarify the problem.

3

And we believe that under Wichita» the Court's

4

decision in 1930 had not acted to revive the prior rate

5

prescription; it had not had any affect at all with

6

respect to our tariffs.

7

way of getting a resolution of that issue was to go back

8

to the D.C. Circuit; hopefully, they would rule that

9

their order related only to the Commission's orders and

QUESTION:

Did you give any consideration to

going before the Commission?
MR. MARTIN:

Well, we did go before the

14

Commission virtually simultaneously.

15

file a tariff again at the San Antonio III level.

16

other words, we believed, as we told the Court, that our

17

tariff on file had not been invalidated by our revived

18

order, but just in case it had and to be careful, we

19

filed a new tariff at exactly the same level and went to

20

the Commission and said, allow this to become effective

21

if, in fact, it's necessary to do so.

QUESTION:

Mr. Martin, did the railroads argue

below that the CADC should not declare the tariffs

function is to review and,

2

Commission orders, which is not the same thing as

3

setting aside or passing on the validity of the

4

carrier's tariffs.

5

inhere appropriate,

set aside

Now* Conrail v. NARY is the most recent

6

decision of this Court on point.

In that case the Court

7

of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit had vacated an ICC order

8

that had established maximum rates on recyclables equal

9

to 130 percent of variable cost.

The court had gone

10

beyond invalidating the order and also ordered that

11

carrier rates filed pursuant to 180 percent ceiling must

12

be revoked.

3

And this Court summarily reversed, holding

4

that the Commission's failure to adequately support the

5

180 percent ceiling did not mean that the ceiling or

16

rate set at that ceiling were "rejected outright."

As

7

this Court pointed out, rates up to that ceiling might

8

eventually prevail at the Commission.

9

basis for that portion of the Court of Appeals order

There was thus no

20

which had gone beyond striking down the order and

21

invalidating the carriers' tariffs.

22

Now, that case is squarely on point in

23

rejecting the proposition that the function of a

24

reviewing court is to restore the status quo ante, which

25

is what the District Court of Appeals in this case did.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Tha function of the reviewing court is not to restore

2

the status quo ante* it is to allow the Commission on

3

remand to decide the validity of the carrier's rates.

4

Now* that is very close to what happened in

5

this case* where the Commission's San Antonio III

6

decision establishing a rate ceiling was set aside

7

because tha rationale was not adequate.

8

of Appeals' first decision in 1980 left open the

9

possibility that rates at that same level might

But the Court

10

eventually prevail after the Commission's proceeding on

11

remana.
The problem is that if the Court's 1981

12
13

decision, which is here on review, is valid* it would

14

mean that for some interim period of time the old 1976

15

temporary rate would apply and no matter what the

16

Commission might decide on the remand, the carriers

17

could never recover their tariff rate for that interim

18

period.

19

Now, the court below recognizes these

20

consequences of its decision, but it in effect blames

21

them on the revived 1976 order of the Commission.

22

However, there is nothing in Wichita, nothing in Conrail

23

v. NARY which suggests that the holding of those cases

24

depended on whether the Commission baa issued one oraer

25

or two orders ot 10 orders.

So long as the tariff rate

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

might eventually prevail on remand before the

2

Commission, then the reviewing court has no power to

3

interfere with the tariff.

4

holding of Conrail v. NARY.

We believe that is the

Now, this limitation on a reviewing court's

5

6

power would apply even if San Antonio I had been

7

revived.

8

intended that the order be temporary, to get the traffic

9

moving.

In fact, the Commission in 1976 had clearly

This is in the appendix at E-13 and F-2.

And

10

by its own terms the '76 crdar had life only "until the

11

further order of the Commission."

12

order was, in fact, issued in 1978.

13

terms the original ,1976 order ceased to have any effect

14

two years before the period in question here.

And such a further
Thus by its own

3 u t even more fundamentally, the Commission

15
16

did not bring the 1976 order back to life in 1930 or in

17

1931.

18

a reasonable maximum rate for 1980-81 would be at the

19

San Antonio I level.

20

The Commission has never ruled, never found, that

In fact, in its April 1981 decision the

21

Commission concluded that the San Antonio I rate was

22

"several years out of date" -- that is at F-4 in the

23

appendix; and "cannot have continued validity because of

24

the new statutory threshold on ICC maximum rate

25

jurisdiction and because of the changed statutory

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

standards since 1976.”

That is at F-8 in the record.

So the question really is inhere an agency rate

3

order which was temporary in the first place expires,

4

where the agency has not itself brought the order back

5

to life and where the agency in fact believes that the

6

old order is out of date and wrong and would not be

7

revived if it was up to the Commission, can a reviewing

8

court bring it back to life for the period of the remand?

9

QUESTION:

In the Commission procedures is

10

there any practice parallel to the one in probate

11

matters of a dependent relative revocation so that whan

12

a subsequent order is set aside, it revives the last

13

proceeding?

14
15
16
17
18

MR. MARTIN:

No, Your Honor.

And the reason

for that is -QUESTION:

Have they ever ordered, have they

ever done that?
MR. MARTIN:

No.

No, Your Honor, because the

19

reason for that is because of the interrelationship

20

between the tariffs which are on file and the maximum

21

rate orders.

22

and that's the difference.

23

The Commission can fully protect everyone,

Where you've got a will and another will, what

24

do you do in the meantime?

Well, you don't have that

25

problem in the ICC or in other statutory situations that

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

are built on the Interstate Commerce Act because there's

2

a tariff there, and if the tariff turns out to be have

3

been too high, the Commission can award reparations and

4

protect everybody.

5

In other words, if we had a $20 tariff on file

6

and the Commission ultimately concluded it wasn't $15,

7

it was $17.50, that would have been a fair maximum

8

reasonable rate for that interim period of time.

9

Commission isn't stuck with the alternative of either

The

10

the $20 or the $15.

It can say, $17.50 was the maximum,

11

pay the reparations back to the $17.50 to make the

12

shipper whole for the excess of the tariff during that

13

period, and pay them interest.

14

has done that.

It can do that, and it

15

Now, what it cannot do is authorize the

16

railroads to go back and once its tariff has been

17

reduced, collect more.

18

was reduced from $20 to $15 for an interim period of

19

time and the Commission later concluded that it really

20

ought to have been $20 or $22 or $13 or anything above

21

that, there's no power to authorize the railroads to go

22

back and retroactively collect that higher amount from

23

the shipper.

24
25

In other words, if our tariff

But the reason that the will situation really
isn't analogous is because of the Commission's

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

flexibility to determine u»hat between the $20 and the

2

$15 is a fair rate and —
QUESTION:

tariff that nullified any prior tariff?

5

MR. MARTIN;

6

QUESTION:

7

now» not the Court.
MR. MARTIN:

8
9

In other words» under the new

tariff.

Well» what would happen is -I am speaking of the Commission

The Commission wouldn't enter a

The carriers go file a tariff, and the tariff

10

becomes the rate that has to be paid by virtue of the

11

fact that it's filed.

12

is look at the tariff and say is that too high or

13

unlawful for any reason.

14

it says that that $20 tariff is too high, we hereby

15

order the railroads to reduce, and then two things

16

happen:

17

that reduced tariff becomes the rate that the shipper

18

has to pay, and so for the future we are taken care of.

19

Now, the question is, what do you do about the past?

20

And if the $20 ought to have been $17.50, the shipper is

21

protected by the reparations and the interest on the

22

reparations.

23

And what the Commission would do

Now» if after having locked»

For the futura» once the tariff is reduced,

out the problem we've got is that if when an

24

order is set aside that had approved a higher rate, the

25

affect of that order is automatically to invalidate not

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

only the order but our tariff and make our tariff

2

unlawful for some period in the past and it gives the

3

Commission no opportunity to make a determination of

4

whether it was reasonable or not, then we are stuck

5

because there's nothing we can do for that interim

6

period of time, and here it was nine months and $20

7

million.

8

Now, the problem here is not simply one of

9

exceeding the Court's jurisdiction to review orders.

It

10

interferes directly with the statutory ratemaking scheme

11

because you have a period of rising costs and changing

12

regulatory standards.

13

ICC or other regulatory agencies to issue a succession

14

of rate orders that will reflect successively higher

15

maximum rates, which is what happened here.

It is not at all uncommon for the

Under this ruling, whenever one such order is

16
17

set aside on review, the last prior lawful order would

18

bounce back into effect, revived for some period of

19

time.

20

prior order was.

21

would apply no matter how inconsistent that revived

22

order is with the changed statutory standards.

23

we had two new stautes that had come into effect.

24
25

And that would happen no matter how outdated the
And here it was 1976 to 1980.

QUESTION:

Do

And it

And here

you think that the Court of

Appeals, Mr. Martin, was attempting to interpret

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Commission intent in deciding the effect of its previous

2

order or that its ruling as to the effect of its ouin

3

decision or order wasn't based on what it conceived to

4

be the intent of the Commission?

5

MR. MARTIN:

It said that it was not based on

6

its own intent or subjective determination as to what

7

the rate level should be* and it said that it was the

8

effect of its order.

9

what the Commission intent was in 1976 or what the

It did not go into the question of

10

Commission's intent would be in 1980.

11

in a more or less mechanical way* without looking at

12

anybody's intent* on the rates involved.

It simply ruled

13

3ut the problem here is not only that time has

14

passed but that in 1976 the Commission passed a new rule

15

of ratemaking» 10704(b)(2) of the statute.

16

applied in the 1976 first order because that proceeding

17

was in midstream by the time the Act was passed.

18

was a brand-new rule of ratemaking.

19

That was not

But it

Then again in 1980 the Staggers Rail Act

20

changed the ratemaking standards some more.

21

problem is that that San Antonio I rate* which goes back

22

to 1976 and was intended to be temporary and interim in

23

the first place* doesn't begin to reflect those changed

24

regulatory standards.

25

And the

Now, I might — I might just go to the —

QUESTION:

3

Mr. Martin,

I would like to

would you clarify one

4

thing for me before you sit down.

5

Antonio apparently applied in October of 1980 with the

6

Tariff Integrity Board challenging the tariffs, in

7

effect.

8

resulted from that?

San

Now, did San Antonio appeal from the order that

MR. MARTIN:

9

And that is,

No, ma'am, they did not.

They —

10

their position with the Tariff Integrity 3oard was that

11

our tariff, which was on file, ought to be rejected

12

because it's inconsistent with the Court of Appeals

13

decision.

14

Geezenboter, which is in this supplemental brown volume

15

of documents, rejected that and said there has been no

16

order of the Commission directing that the tariff be

17

rejected or reduced.

18

In the Tariff Integrity Board letter from Mr.

QUESTION:

And did San Antonio ever actually

19

file a complaint with the Commission or just something

20

with the Board?

21

MR. MARTIN:

No, they did not.

They took the

22

position that the Court of Appeals decision had given

23

them the relief they wanted? they didn't have to go to

24

the Commission.

25

QUESTION:

Okay.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY ELLIOTT SCHULDER, ESQ.,

2
3

ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL RESPONDENT SUPPORTING PETITIONER
MR. SCHULDERi

4
5

Mr. Schulder

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The United States and the Interstate Commerce

6
7

Commission agree with petitioners that the Court of

8

Appeals decision in this case violates the rule against

9

judicial ratemaking established in this Court's Wichita

10

and Conrail decisions.

11

interferes with the Commission's exclusive authority to

12

determine proper rates, and it reaches an inequitable

13

result.

14

The decision below basically

San Antonio has argued that Wichita ana

15

Conrail are distinguishable Because they do not involve

16

successive rate orders.

17

holding in earlier ICC order revived in declaring

18

inconsistent tariff rates unlawful is precisely the same

19

that -- the Court of Appeals decision was incorrect.
QUESTION:

3ut Conrail wasn't the first case

of this genre* was it?
MR. SCHULDER:

8

9

However, after this Court's

Well* Conrail was — Conrail

was the first case in which a majority of this Court

10

held that a reviewing court has no authority at all with

11

which to set rates or determine rate policy in the

12

context of a remanded proceedirg.
Now* the argument that the Court of Appeals

13
14

overstepped its bound under Wichita and Conrail we feel

15

is also supported by the filed rate doctrine.

16

look at the record in this case* the only tariff that

17

was on file during the remand period at issue here* the

18

10-month* 9- or 10-month period at issue, was the tariff

19

filed at the San Antonio III level.

If we

There was* in fact, no tariff on file

20
21

governing the movements in question at the level of San

22

23

here, San Antonio paid only the rate at the San Antonio

24

I level.

25

Yet during the entire period in question

The Court's decision, by declaring tariff

1

rates -- tariff rates here unlawful has rewarded San

2

Antonio's resort to self-help and, in effect, sanctioned

3

San Antonio's violation of the filed rate doctrine.
The filed rate doctrine has its origins in the

4
5

Interstate Commerce Act, which requires shippers to pay

6

and carriers to collect only filed tariff rates.

7

shipper believes that a filed tariff rate is unlawful

8

either because it's inconsistent with the Commission

rate order or for any other reason, the proper remedy is

And

11

if the Commission at that point finds the rate unlawful,

12

it may award the shipper reparations for any overcharge

13

and any interest.

14

by the statutory scheme.

Thus, the shipper is fully protected

San Antonio, however, has argued that it is

15
16

excusad from paying the tariff rate for this period

17

because the Act prohibits carriers from publishing or

18

collecting rates in excess of those prescribed by the

19

Commission.

20

shipper must pay when there is an ongoing dispute over

21

whether the tariff rate is in violation of the

22

Commission's order.

23

Antonio or even to the Court of Appeals to decide in the

24

first instance whether a tariff rate is or is not

25

unlawful.

out the question here is what rate the

It is not up to a shipper like San

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The Commission is not arguing here that filed

1

2

rates ar9 automatically the lawful rates that govern a

3

particular movement in question* but that the

4

determination of lawful rates is for the Commission to

5

make.

6

authority to make a determination* we submit* is to

7

adhere to the filed rates with the remedy, of course, of

8

reparations in the event the shipper wishes to file a

9

complaint in testing the validity of a tariff rate.

10

The only way to preserve the Commission's

Thus, the purpose of the filed rate doctrine

11

essentially is to provide a rigid rule* that is* the

12

shipper must pay the filed rate until the dispute over

13

the proper rate is resolved by the Commission.

14

filed rate doctrine, therefore, like the rule in Wichita

15

and Conrail* preserves the Commission's jurisdiction

16

over rates.

17

The

The Court of Appeals decision in this case,

however, violates both the Wichita and Conrail and the

hopefully, in quite a bit less, I am going to try to

respond to each of those three arguments.

13

do, I would like to emphasize one aspect by way of

14

factual background; and that is, the significance of the

15

San Antonio I rate order.

16

significance to my client because it has been the only

constraining force against runaway rail prices during

the nation's energy crisis.

It has a very practical

And secondly, it is extremely critical to this

19

20

litigation because all of this voluminous record -- and

21

indeed, we submit, this very action before the Court

22

today -- is one of a series of unceasing efforts by the

23

railroads to extricate themselves from the constraint of

24

the order.

25

So as we go through each of these argumens, we

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

submit that th9 very distinguishing feature is the San

prescribed rates.

6

this

A statistically immeasurable amount

So you have here a very unusual situation.
Now,

9

And in that connection,

as I say, the basic allegation of error

10

is that the court below violated this Court's rules in

Wichita and Conrail.

12

speaking, divide the functions between the judiciary and

13

in this case the Interstate Commerce Commission.

14

15

suggested that the -- that the laws and the policy of

16

the Congress have ousted the federal judiciary from

17

taking injunctive action.

18

asserts that the court below crossed over this forbidden

19

line into this forbidden territory in its decision.

And those rules, very generally

They

And their basic allegation

Now, I think I have fairly stated what they're

20
21

saying.

3ut how the court did it is not nearly as

22

clear.

23

in this Court to do is to stretch and expand the

24

principles and boundaries that exist today in the Arrow

25

line of decisions.

And what they have done or what they are seeking

And basically,

they're very easily

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

In Arrow and Scrap the Court concluded that the

stated

2

federal courts should not take injunctive action prior

3

to the time that the Interstate Commerce Commission has

4

acted finally.

5

concluded that the Court should not take intrusive

6

injunctive action where the ICC has acted finally but

7

the Court reverses or remands that action.
So we have a body of law that ousts the

Why wasn't the

Well» of course» Your Honor, we

submit that this Court's decision and the Arizona

the Commission -- in other words, for example, the

Commission itself could not have at the end of the

proceeding said, we have examined this initial rate and

14

we find that at some point in the past it became

15

unsatisfactory, so we are going to set a rate for the

16

future and also adjust for tha past.
That process could not have taken place with

17
18

or without the district -- the Cicruit Court action.

19

the rate prescription order can never be retroactively

I don't know.

The

12

possibility was that those rates would be reestablished

13

and that the Commission would have said, that's what

14

they always should have been.

MR. SLOVER;

But they can

23

the Commission can suspend it if it wants to.

Now, when a railroad files a new tariff,

MR.

SLCVER;

That's correct.
And I suppose on the remand, if the

1

2

tariff.

3

MR. SLOVERi

Well, of course, at the time this

4

litigation came up, as you mentioned in the direct

5

arguments, the Commission was taking our position.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SLCVER:

Yes, I know.
They had attempted to file

8

tariffs, and they did take the position that we espouse}

9

namely, that tariffs in conflict with the rate order

10

could not be filed.

11

QUESTION:

MR. SLQVER:

Now —
Well, it's already filed.

consider them to be null and void —
QUESTION:

The Commission never ordered them

suspended or revoked or withdrawo.
MR. SLGVER:

But they — we concluded that

17

they were null and void because they were in conflict

18

with the outstanding rate order.

19

Now, as I say, the real heart of the position

20

of the petitioners in the final analysis, as we read it,

21

comes down to a series of efforts to, in essence, make

22

the San Antonio I rate order go away.

So taken on balance, if you were to reverse

the D.C. Circuit, you would, in essence, be restoring

Cur theory is that there's no hole, that the

The carrier's tariff is on file

Sack in May of 1981 the Commission,

10

in the decision that is in the brown book at 5, restored

pricing freedom to the carriers.

QUESTION:

13

the shortfall in the interim?
MR. MARTIN:

14

Can they recover from San Antonio

If you reverse, we will be able

15

to go back and collect from them for that interim period

16

of nine months our tariff.

17

decides that the tariff was too high for that period or

18

any other portion of this four-year period, it can

19

require us, yes, sir, to pay reparations and to pay

20

interest.

And then if the Commission

Now, I would like to address the point that

21

22

was made about San Antonio I being the only constraining

23

force on the railroads and you have to somehow affirm

24

the Court of Appeals because it's the only constraining

25

force.

That just isn't right, because from 1978 to '30

it didn't exist and it doesn't exist today
I would like to call the Court's attention to

the Appendix F-ll, which is where th^ May 7» 1981» order

appears.

5

Antonio I on everybody's theory is gone, everybody's.

6

And Judge Wilkie acknowledged it in his decision at

7

A-6.

8

jurisdiction over the entire period to imolament the

9

standards of the Act, and the only question is whether

And as of that date and that order, San

So that is gone, and the Commission has

10

there's a nine-month chunk in the middle of that period

11

ovar which it has no jurisdiction and over which it has

12

no alternative except to restore a rate which it

13

believes is out of date by years, is inconsistent with

14

the statutory standards.
Again, a brief reference, at F-7 and F-8 of

15
16

the record.

17

Commission's intent is, at least today, because we

18

know.

19

it said that the San Antonio rate is supported neither

20

by current cost data or current legal standards, or at

21

least that there's no reason to believe it is, and that

22

not even San Antonio- contends that its evidence would

23

ultimately justify reimposition of the San Antonio

24

prescription.

25

We don't have to speculate about what the

In May of 1981 it got out this decision, in which

This is the Commission in May of '31.

It says

that the San Antonio I rate» if restored, mould be may

bslom even the threshold for Commission maximum rate

jurisdiction, and a rate of that kind "cannot have

continued validity."

This is at F-8 of the record.

viem is in 1580-31.
