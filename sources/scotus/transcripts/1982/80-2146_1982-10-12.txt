ORAL ARGUMENT OF CALVIN L. FOX, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FOX:

9 Court,

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

thi s is a petition to review the decision of the

10 Flo rida Th ird District

11

Court of Appeal in which the

Flo rida Th ird District Court of Appeal reversed both the

12 app ella te panel and

the trial court upon their denial of

13 the def end ant's motion to suppress.

The facts are extremely simple.

14

The defendant

15 was arr est ed at the Miami International Airport carrying
16 65 poun ds of marijuana in his luggage.

at the Mia mi International Airport eight hours a day,

22 f XV e da ys a week.
23

On January 3rd,

1973, about noon, the

24 defendant appeared at the airport.

Detective Johnson

25 testified that in his experience and Detective

1

Magdalena's experience, it was undeniable that the

2 defendant's conduct and demeanor attracted their

3 attention.

The defendant was extremely nervous, pale,

4 uneasy, looking about, and Detective Johnson testified
5 that in his experience, the defendant was not a
6

so-called white knuckled flier, but rather was concerned

7 about being detected.
The bags the defendant was carrying were very

8

9 heavy.

He had produced an extremely large roll of cash

10 to pay for his ticket.
11

The defendant was observed

placing on the airline identification labels the name of

12 Holt, and his ticket apparently was also in that name

13 also.

It was undisputed below —

That was on his baggage, you said?
Yes, Your Honor.
When did the officer find out that

17 he bought a one-way ticket, if that was the case?
MS. F3X;

18

When they examined his ticket and

19 license upon request at the initial encounter with the
20 defendant,
21

Your Honor.

It was undisputed,

as a matter

of fact, including through the defendant's testimony,

22 that they approached him and asked him if he had a

23 moment to talk, and ha said, fine.

The defendant

24 himself testified that upon request —

that time?
MR. FOX:

2

Yes, Your Honor, they identified

3 themselves as narcotics officers, and said,
4 with you a moment.

may we speak

The defendant himself testified that

5 he voluntarily produced his ticket and his license for
6 their examination.

They immediately noticed the

7 discrepancy between his ticket and the baggage and the
8 license,

and he explained that someone else had made the

9 reservation for him.

Johnson then told the defendant that they

10
11

believed that he was carrying narcotics, and would he

12 come to a room a few feet away for further discussion.

14 throughout the transaction.

QUESTION*

Well, did they indicate that he

2 didn’t need to go, or not?
3

NR. FOX*

No, Your Honor.

There is not a

4

Mendenhall type warning, if you will, in this

5

circumstance.

The defendant proceeded to the room, as

6 did Sylvia Mendenhall, without discussion.
7

QUESTION*

8

MR. FOX*

9

Who had possession of the ticket?
The ticket was in -- evidently was

in Detective Johnson’s possession at all times, but it

10

was never taken out of the —

QUESTION*

12

MR. FOX*

QUESTION*

14
15

Once it was handed over.
Pardon me?
Once it was handed over.

Did he

hand it to the police?
MR. FOX*

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, but the

16

ticket actually never left the defendant's possession.

17

It was always right there with him, with Detective

18

Johnson, as they were carrying out the discussion, and

19

as they went to the adjacent room.

20
21

QUESTION*
his possession.

Wait a minute.

I thought he handed it to the detective.

22

(General laughter.)

23

MR. FOX*

24
25

You said never left

Never left his presence.

Excuse me.

Your Honor.
QUESTION*

But it was in the possession of the

1 detective.
2

Is that not correct?
MR. FOX;

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's

3 correct.
4

QUESTION;

So if he wanted to get on the

5 airplane, he would have had a little difficulty.
6

MR. FOX;

He would first of all have to ask to

7 get the ticket back.
8

QUESTION;

9

MR. FOX;

For his ticket back.
That's correct, which he did not do

10 in this case, of course, but there was also, as an
11 indication of the nature of the transaction, the
12 defendant indicated himself that he understood all

that

13 was going on, and there was no physical contact at any
14 time.
15

Detective Johnson, I think important to this

16 Court's consideration here, testified that he wanted to
17 go to the adjacent room to avoid any embarrassment to
18 the defendant and to avoid any possible violence in the
10 crowded airport area.

In the room, which was 40 feet

20 away, they again asked him if they could — they
21 initially asked him for his consent to open his
22 suitcase,

and they told him again that they suspected

23 him of transporting narcotics.

In response, the

24 defendant produced a key, unlocked one of the -25

QUESTION;

Mr. Fox, let me ask you another

1

question.

You mentioned the violence concern that the

2 officer expressed.

Do you think the facts that were

3

known to the officer at the time he requested the ticket

4

would have justified a frisk of the passenger for

5

weapons ?
SR. FOXi

6

Yes, Your Honor.

I think in view of

7 the —

QUESTION:

8
9

Did the officer frisk the

passenger?
MR. FOX:

10

No, Your Honor.

I think in view of

11

the extremely agitat ed condition of the defendant, I

12

think a frisk would have been appropriate, but it was

13

not done.
QUESTION :

14
15

He was carrying two suitcases, was

he?
SR. FOX:

16

Yes, Your Honor, two suitcases.
He unlocked it.

19

they could go ahead an d open it if they wanted to. and

20 thereupon they opene d it, and it c ontained the
21

marijuana.
The entire transaction took ten to fifteen

22

The initia 1 approach took a matter of only a

23

minutes.

few minutes.

Hell, suppose when they first

stopped him he had said no, I don't particularly care to

2 talk to you,

I don't particularly care to identify

3

myself, or hand you over my ticket?

4

free to go?
MR. FOX:

5

Would he have been

Detective Johnson specifically

6 testified that when people refused to talk to them, that
7

if they don't have enough facts, they let them go.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

And if he had said, when they asked

him to go into the other room, he had said, no, I don't
want to, the testimony is, they would have let him go?

11

HR. FOXs

12

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, that is —
So he gets to the room, and they

13

say, may we search your suitcase, and he says, no, you

14

may not.

15
16
17
18
19

What is the testimony about that?
MR. FOXj

There is no indication one way or

the other, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Now, I was --

Did the officers at any time tell

him that he was free to go?
MR. FOX:

No, Your Honor, there was no

20 specific advisement.
21

QUESTION:

Did they also tell him that he was

22 free not to turn his ticket loose?
23
24
25

MR. FOX:

No, Your Honor, they did not

specifically advise him of that.
QUESTION:

And did they also tell him he

They didn't tell him any of the

MR. FOX;

QUESTION:

8

MR. FOX:

9

No, Your Honor, they did not

No, Your Honor, they did not.
They only told him the do's.
Well, they asked him that, these

guestions, Your Hon or, and the trial court accepted, that

10

as a matter of fact , that in fact the transaction was

11

totally voluntary.
QUESTION;

12
13

Well, you have two armed men who

say, would you mind coming along with me.

14

(General laughter.)

15

QUESTION:

Is there any evidence that he knew

16 that they were acme d?
17

QUESTION:

And, I mean, how many people do you

18 know wouldn’t go?
19

MR. FOX;

Your Honor, I certainly wouldn’t

Would you go?

You wouldn’t go ?

22 Honor.

MR. FOX:

This was in no means an arrest. Your

That is what the Florida Third District en banc

23 held, that it was an arrest.
24

QUESTION:

What precisely does the holding

25 that something was an arrest mean?

Is that basically a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

factual issue or a legal issue, or is it a mixed

MR. FOX;

the facts presented.
QUESTION:

6

It is a mixed question based upon
We would submit -Does it imply a determination by

whoever is making the finding that subjectively the

7 person felt he was not free to go,

or that objectively a

8 reasonable person in his position would not have felt
9

free to go, which of those two?
MR. FOX:

10

I think objectively, the reasonable

11

person innocent of crime is the standard which this

12

Court has articulated.

13

defendant himself sail in the room that he was not under

15

Court of Appeals conclusion that he was under arrest.

16

In particular, we would point to the fact that the

17

numerous reasons announced by the Third District Court

18

of Appeals as reasons for the arrest were not thought of

19

or dreamed up by anybody in the trial court.

In particular. Your Honor, the

I think that totally belies the Third District

22 officers.

We are here years later arguing matters which

Ann VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the trier of fact, the defendant, and the police

2 officers never thought of.

QUESTION;

3

But, Mr. Fox, just to interrupt for

4

a moment, what is the court that we should look to for

5

the facts, the trial court or the appellate court?

It

6 is a state court, and I suppose we have a limited right

7 to disagree with them on the facts, and the appellate
8 court did say he was in fact not free to leave.

They

9 said that unequivocally.
10

MR . FOX:

11

QUESTION :

12

MR. FOXs

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. FQX;

The en banc court.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Are we bound by that?
No, Your Honor.

I think the record

15

in the trial court is what we are bound by here, as a

16

matter of fact.

17

was determined by the Third District Court of Appeal en

18

I think there was another thing that

They kept calling it the police room .
QUESTION:

19

What standard of review do we

20

follow in deciding whether or not a state appellate

21

court was wrong in disagreeing with the state trial

22 court on the facts?

Is it clearly erroneous, or

23

substantial evidence, or what is the standard we should

24

apply?

25

MR. FOX;

I think that if there is substantial

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

evidence in the trial court to base

for the trial

2 court to hive reached the conclusion that this was a
3

voluntary transaction, that that must be flagrantly

4

erroneous, it must be clearly erroneous, and must be a

5

substantial departure from the constitutional law of

6 this Court.

QUESTION;

7

Why?

Must a state have -- must a

8 state appellate court have some standard about
9

overruling its trial courts?

What standard does the

10

Constitution require?

11

court overruled the district court.

12

MR. FOX;

13

QUESTION;

Here surely the Florida appellate

Well, that -It may be that if it applied the

14

wrong legal standard in adjudicating the federal

15

constitutional question, we could certainly correct

16

that, and even if it didn't apply the right — even if

17

it applied the right standard, we could disagree with it

18

if it is a mixed question of fact and law.
MR. FOX;

19

Absolutely, Your Honor, and we have

20 argued vigorously in our brief that the standard here
21

is, as this Court found in Mendenhall, is that the

22 circuit court of appeal was totally mistaken in
23

substituting its judgment for that of the trier of fact

24

as to the issues of fact before the trial court, and

25

that is —

i

Did the Court of Appeals of Florida

2 have anything before it that we haven’t before us in
3

this case now?

4

MR. FOXi

5

QUESTION*

No, Your Honor.
Didn’t it have a concession that

6 the state made at the oral argument before that court

7 which they refer to that the state conceded at oral
8 argument that the officers would not have permitted
9
10

Royer to leave?

We don’t have that before us, but they

had it before them.
MR. FOXi

11

You have my offer in the brief, Your

12

Honor, that in fact after an extensive argument with

13

Judge Schwartz, I stated to him that in fact I wasn’t

14

there, I don’t know what the officers would have done.
QUESTIONi

15
16

Are you telling us there was no

such concession?
MR. FOXi

17

There was a concession, but the

18

concession was qualified in a certain context, and that

19

context was that in fact if —

What I am suggesting to you is, we

They heard your argument there.
MR. FOX;

We didn't.

Yes, Your Honor, they do -- they

24

did, but I don't think. — I don't think the concession

25

is a dispositive issue in this case.

QUESTION

2

NR. FOXi

Why not?
I think that tha officers would not

have let him leave, Your Honor.

4

-- speculating what they might hava dona is not the

5

issue.

The question is what did they do.
QUESTION;

7

I don't think that is

And you think tha issue is what a

reasonable person would have thought about whether he

NR. FOX;

9

QUESTION;

10

Innocent of crime.
The officers may have decided in

11

their own minds, we will never let him go, but a

12

reasonable person might have thought that he was free to

13

go.

Is that your argument?
NR. FOX;

14

Certainly it could be a voluntary

15

transaction, irrespective as to the officer's intent in

16

the case.

17

voluntary transaction, and Your Honors, I think at the

18

point where the defendant said, no, I don’t want to give

19

you consent to look in my suitcase, and I want to leave,

They proceeded on the basis that it was a

20 I think that circumstance is a different circumstance
21

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERS

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. AS AMICUS CURIAE

4

MR. FREIs

5

Mr. Frey.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, this case has several issues in

6 it that are of great importance doctrinally to Fourth

7 Amendment law and to federal law enforcement.

If you analyze the sequence of events that

8
9

arose here, you begin with the initial contact between

10 the agents and
11

Mr. Royer, and there is an issue whether

at that point you had a seizure of his person within the

12 meaning of the Fourth Amendment or simply a contact not
13

regulated by the Fourth Amendment.

14

important because if you had a seizure, you can consider

15 in
16

That issue is

the effort to justify that seizure only the facts

known to the agents at the time they first approached

17 Mr.

Royer, and not facts that they learned during the

18 initial interview

with him.

Now, when the situs of the transaction moved

19

20 from the concourse to the office nearby, you have a
21

question whether that movement was either fully

22 voluntary and not subject to the Fourth Amendment, as
23 was

said in Mendenhall, or a continuation of an

24 investigative detention,

or an arrest requiring probable

25 cause.

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Now, I would like to turn first to the arrest

1

2 issue, because I believe that is what the state court
3

rested on.

4

whether the consent to the search of the suitcases was

5

voluntary.

There is, of course, a final issue as to

I won't address that.

6 decided by the lower court.

I don't think it was

The rationale of the lower

7 court was a fruits rationale, that even if the consent
8 was voluntary, it was the product of an antecedent
9

illegal, seizure of Mr. Royer's person.
Now, I think it is crystal clear that the

10
11

lower court used the wrong test in identifying whether

12 Mr.
13

Royer was under arrest at the time he was moved to

the office and the consent was secured.
QUESTIONS

You are talking about the court of

review here.

The opinion that is under

That opinion suggests that the criterion

20 for determining whether there was an arrest requiring
21

probable cause is whether the suspect was free to

22 leave.

25

As we have indicated in our brief -QUESTION;

I thought that it said whether he

reasonably believed he was free —
MR. FREY;

Hell, if he reasonably believed he

5

was frse to leave, yes.
QUESTIONS

Well, that is quite different.

That is quite different.
MR. FREIs

Well, not for my point.

I

absolutely agree that the tast is an objective one, and

6 not his subjective belief or the subjective intentions

7 of the officer.

But the point that I am making here is

8 that the test of free to leave is a tast that
9

distinguishes not arrests from non-arrests, but Fourth

10

Amendment seizures from non-saizures, and it is well

11

settled that Fourth Amendment seizures consist of two

12

kinds of things, the Terry type investigative detention

13

or an arrest.

14

not amounting to probable cause; the latter requires

15

probable cause.

16

One can be based on reasonable suspicion

Now, in deciding whether what happened here

17

was an arrast, it seems to me that it strains the

18

English language and the logical structure of Fourth

19

Amendment analysis to call this an arrest.

If you view

20 these events as occurring to an innocent traveler who
21

has mistakenly been seized upon as a possible drug

22 courier by the agents, it would be quite clear to that
23

person that he had not yet been arrested, that he was

24

being detained for a brief course of investigation which

25

would result in his release if he knew he was innocent

after the officers looked in the luggage.
It did not have the indicia of duration.

If

3

you compare it to Dunaway, you are talking about moving

4

him a number of miles to the police station, keeping him

5

for an indefinite period until he confessed.

6 standpoint of Mr. Dunaway,

From the

even if he were innocent, he

7 would have perceived what happened to him, I think,
8 quite clearly as being — having the essential
9
10
11

attributes of a formal arrest, which is the language the
Court used last term in Michigan against Summers.
Now, it is important in our view not to place

12

undue emphasis in defining an arrest on the factors that

13

the lower court here, the en banc court relied upon,

14

which is movement or detention or extended custody

15

beyond a momentary stop, because those factors may arise

16

in many contexts where we believe that they can be

17

legitimately done as part of an investigative detention,

18

for instance, the detention of a suspected robber near

19

the scene of the robbery and the question whether he

20 could be moved, let's say,
21

a block to the scene of the

robbery for purposes of a show-up without having

22 probable cause.
23

Now, let me say finally on the arrest issue

24

that if you don't say this was not an arrest, that does

25

not leave the subject of investigative detentions

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unregulated under the Fourth Amendment.

An

2 investigative detention, like an arrest, must be
3

reasonable, and you have the ability to say in this case

4

that the detention under the circumstances may have been

5

unreasonable, but sailing it an arrest, I think, would

6 be most unfortunate.

He couldn't have thought — well, I

think it is very important that you look at it from the

of these rules is to protect against innocent people

happened, whether he would have been detained while they

SR. KLEIN;

Your Honor, we can go on the basis

12 of either the state's concession at oral argument or as

they now -QUESTION;

evidence in the case.

No, Your Honor, but I think that

17

the state's argument that is set forth in their reply

18

brief points out specifically on Page 9, it said, what

19

would have -- what would have happened after that is

20 that certainly in that event the officers could have
21

readily sought other means of gathering information,

22 including the use of a trained narcotics dog.
23

So I think that their basic argument is that

24

irrespective of whether or not the consent was

25

ultimately granted, then this individual was not going

So there was a limited Terry type

stop or seizure up to what point?
HR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, we maintain that there

6 was a limited encounter that took place in the form of

7 the conversation, and then beyond that I think that it
8 is unreasonable to say that anybody who is approached by
9

officers in a public place, regardless of whether they

10

are guilty or they are innocent, and the standard is an

11

innocent person, we maintain that an innocent person who

12

is asked by officers to please show his driver’s license

13

and his ticket, that it is unreasonable for --

14

QUESTION:

Do you thin-k the conversation

15

became unlawful at the moment the request was made to

16

see the driver’s license?

17

HR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, we maintain that at

18

the point that they asked for — at the point that he

19

was asked for his driver's license and his ticket, at

20 that juncture a reasonable person would not feel that
21

they were free to walk away.

22 individual,

It is natural for an

whether they are guilty or they are

23

innocent, when they are approached by a police officer,

24

to produce those documents.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, in the Summers decision

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that has been mentioned, it is perfectly clear that the

2 individual there was not free to walk away.
3

MR. KLEIN:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, Your Honor.
The rationale of that case, as I

understood it, was that under circumstances that create

6 a reasonable suspicion, the officers may detain an
7 individual for a period of time.

8

MR. KLEIN:

9

QUESTION:
MR. KLEIN:

10
11

Your Honor -Do you agree with that or not?
Your Honor, Michigan versus

Summers was a highly limited situation, and I think that

12 the underlying rationale there was that the issue of
13

probable cause had already been submitted to a neutral,

14

detached magistrate.
QUESTION:

15
16

Probable cause to detain the

individual outside of his home?
MR. KLEIN:

17

No, Your Honor.

It was probable

18

cause for the search b"f the house, and under those

19

circumstances, a limited seizure detention of the

20 individual was appropriate in order to ascertain if
21

there was going to be any evidence that was turned up in

22 the house.

But I don't think the Michigan versus

23

Summers reflects the proper model for determination of

24

the issues here.

25

QUESTION;

Who was the person detained in that

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case?

2

SR. KLEIN:

3

QUESTION:

4

It was the owner of the house.
And that house was covered by a

search warrant?
SR. KLEIN:

5

That's correct, and that was

6 really the underlying rationale, that a neutral,
7 detached magistrate had issued a search warrant,

and I

8 think, the Court made it quite clear that that function
9

should be served by someone in that position rather than

10 those who are on

11

the front line such as police who are

often engaged in the competitive aspects of ferreting

12 out crime.

QUESTION:

13
14

Klein.

Refresh my recollection, Sr.

Did the Court in Sumner rely on'Terry?

That was

15 my recollection.

SR. KLEIN:

16

Your Honor, it was a Terry

17 extension.

QUESTION:

18

A Terry type limited seizure, was

19 my recollection.

SR. KLEIN:

20
21

Your Honor, it was a Terry type

limited seizure.

22

QUESTION:

23

SR. KLEIN:

24 rationale of
25 a warrant,

Right.
But it was based upon the

a neutral magistrate already having secured

and I think that that is the way that that

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

can be justified under those circumstances, and it was

2 justified on the basis that it was necessary in order to
3

determine whether or not there was any individual or any

4

proof that might turn up during the course of the search

5

itself, which is far more intrusive in and of itself

6 than the seizure of the individual.

Now, what our position is is that whatever

7

8 Terry stop may have been justified in the first instance
9 in this matter became increasingly more custodial and
10

ultimately culminated in an illegal arrest.

The

11

traditional dividing point has always been, of course,

12

probable cause.

13

intermediate step which was limited in nature and in

14

purpose.

15

Articulable suspicion permits a limited seizure of the

16

person, but it must be done with the clear caveat that

17

whatever intrusion tak.es place pursuant to this seizure

18

must be limited to that which made its initiation

19

permissible in the first place.

The Terry case recognized an

It is between the contact and an arrest.

So that asking a seized

20 driver to get out of his car for the immediate safety of
21

the officer has been upheld.

22 has been upheld.

A patdown, as in Terry,

In Fuenta, Martinez, Martinez Fuenta,

23

border stop inquiry with reference to immigration status

24

has been upheld, but none of those cases and none of the

25

Terry line of cases have expanded the intermediate step

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

to the extreme here without either reguirin g probable

1

2 cause or calling it an arrest.

So therefore the real question is , is what

3

4 happened here,

up to the actual point of th e search of

5 the luggage, can

it be justified as a Terry- stop.

Now,

6 first of all, I think it is important to di stinguish

there was a valid Terry stop here initially.

Just

3

MR. KLEIN;

4

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
If they had then asked him, may we

5 search your luggage, and he said yes,

and they searched

6 it right on the spot, no problem.
7

MR. KLEIN:

I have no problem with that

8 whatsoever.
9

QUESTION:

It is just the movement into the

10 other room?
11

MR. KLEIN:

Even under certain circumstances,

12 a movement may be appropriate,

but it was the

13 combination of factors here.
14

QUESTION:

A movement could be a lot less

15 embarrassing.
16

MR. KLEIN:

17 that is the case,

Your Honor, that is true, but if

then every time that the police

18 conduct a so-called Terry stop,

and they want to avoid

19 embarrassment to the subject of

the Terry stop, that

20 would in their rationale permit them to move him off to
21

some isolated place.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. KLEIN:

And then what?
And then conduct whatever it is

24 that they want to do.

I don't have the supplemental

I am reading under the section that is

Yes, Your Honor.

It says, "For all

23 employed to describe this situation is, however,
24 unimportant."

Yes.
Without finding them coerced.

10

MR. KLEIN;

11

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, I agree.
What is your submission here?

Is

12 it that the consent was coerced and therefore invalid?

MR. KLEIN:

13

Your Honor, the consent — there

14 was no consent, is our position, is therefore invalid,
15 but irrespective of that, it was a Terry stop that
16 exceeded the scope of what is reasonably necessary.
17

QUESTION:

And thereupon became an arrest.

18

MR. KLEIN:

Yes, Your Honor, it did, and in

19 connection with that, the Court's inquiry of the
20 government as to tfhen a seizure becomes an arrest, and
21

the government was unable to come up with a clear

22 definition.

Well,

I like the definition that the

23 government itself gave, and that was in their brief in
24 this case.

They advert to their brief in the Michigan

25 versus Summers case, and on Page 10, they point out in

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

the ir brief that after saying that Dunaway made it clear

2 tha t the formal label is not dispositive, that "probable
3 cau se is required wheneve there is a sufficiently
4 sub stantial invasion of the suspect's freedom of
5

BOV

ement.

What constitutes a sufficiently substantial

6 dep rivation of liberty to require probable cause remains
7 to be fleshed out.

If, however, a detention is deemed

8 to be of sufficient severity to fall within this
9 cat egory, its lawfulness will not be evaluated by
10 c ef erence to a

11

general reasonable analysis, but will

ord inarily depend solely upon the existence of probable

2

MR. KLEIN:

No, Your Honor.

I wouli say that

3 by the time he was asked for his consent, he was under
4 arrest,

and I think that it is impossible to single out

5 any of those crucial elements that I have adverted to,
6 and the court, the Florida court,

the appeals court did

7 not try to distinguish between those crucial elements,
8 and

I think that the government is incorrect when they

9 say that the sole basis of the Florida court’s position
10 about an illegal arrest was based upon his — the
11

reasonable apprehension that he was not free to go.

12 That was merely one of the factors that the Florida
13 court adverted to in making its ultimate determination
14 that an arrest had occurred.
15

It specifically cited the other instances of

16 misconduct inii eating that the man was not free to go.
17 such as the -- and that he was in effect in a classic
18 case of imprisonment.

police to take what is essentially a hunch.

2 out the factors that fit.

They select

They give it a label, and

3 they mask, what is essentially a hunch and essentially
4 arbitrary action --

QUESTION

5

What is arbitrary about following a

6 hunch?
7

MR. KLEIN:

8

QUESTION:

There is nothing.
I personally am not persuaded that

9 police officers enjoy running around after red herrings
0 or running after people who really aren’t going to

provide any leads or clues.

Shouldn't the courts give

12 some deference in this situation to the considered
3 experience of law enforcement personnel, just on the
4 basis that they are the ones on the scene,

and probably

5 know a little bit more about it than we do?
5

MR. KLEIN:

7 that's true.

Your Honor, in some instances,

First of all, though, we are dealing with

18 a particular case, and here, this case , the officer had
19 all of one month's experience.
20 since November.
2

He had been on the job

Th is was January.

QUESTION:

Well, but the profile was

22 presumably devised by people other tha n him

23

MR . KLEIN :

24

QUESTION:

All right.

•

Yes, Your Honor.

What does the one mont h's

25 experience have to do with it?

50

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. KLEIN:

All right. Your Honor, because we

2 are talking about what essentially must be
3

individualized suspicion, and a perfect example here is

4

that some of the characteristics that were adverted to

5

by the officer in his testimony as to why he suspected

6 this person was because he was carrying American
7

Tourister luggage.

He said he was carrying one old

8 suitcase, one new suitcase, and he put them up near the
9

counter, and most people carry their luggage with them.

10

Now, the profile has its place.

11

administrative tool for the police to use to single out

12

possible suspicious activity for further investigation,

13

but it should not be used as a justification for

14

intruding on the Fourth Amendment.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KLEIN;

It is an excellent

Why not?
Because the fact of being part of

17

a profile in and of itself should not be used in

18

connection with a Terry stop as a substitute for

19

individualized suspicion.

I think every case since

20 Terry has talked about individualized suspicion as to
21

why it was that a particular element in the profile was

22 or was not -23

QUESTION:

Supposing the government could

24

produce evidence, which I take it it hasn't here, that

25

if each of these elements of the profile when they were

51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

run down, 70 percent of the follow-ups indicated a

2 person who was probably guilty of some offense and 30

3 percent didn't.

Now, would you say that an officer

4 couldn't simply apply that profile across the board if
5 it were documented in that way, without making any
6 further individualized determination?

MR. KLEIN;

7

I still think, that he needs to

8 make an individualized determination in every instance.

9 I think that that sort of statistical approach —
QUESTION;

10
11

Well, what if the individualized

determination he makes was that this person whom I am

12 following now exhibits eight of

the ten characteristics

13 that the profile says to look for, and each of those ten
14 characteristics is documented by experience?
MR. KLEIN;

15

I still think, Your Honor, under

16 those circumstances, that he has to be able to
17 articulate whether or why any particular item of
18 behavior, regardless of whether it is on or off the
19 profile —
20

21
22

QUESTION;

Any particular item or the

combination of all of them?
MR. KLEIN;

He can use a combination of all of

23 them , bu t he still must articulate why it is that h e
24 believes that these things lead him to suspect tha t a
25 crime is being committed.

52

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

Why not past experience?

If 80

2 percent of the follow-ups in the past of people with a
3

particular kind of luggage have indicated that you find

4

a guilty person, why isn't that a perfectly adequate

5

basis of using that in the case of an expert who comes

6 along ?
7

ME. KLEIN:

Your Honor , I still think that

8 under those circumstances,
9

that there has got to be some

showing that in this particular case that they suspect

10

him of a crime, because each of those things are

11

QUESTION:

Of course, but that is a very

fallacious approach of the undis tributed middle, which

14

really doesn't mean anything in this kind of situation,

15

You say — You keep referring to what you think and what

16

you believe.

17

MR. KLEIN:

18

QUESTION:

19

Yes, Your Honor.
What cases from this Court support

your view that a profile of this sort is not usable in

20 any circumstances?
21

MR. KLEIN:

Your Honor, I think that the

22 concurring opinion in the Mendenhall case in Footnote
23

Number 6, Justice Powell specifically indicated that a

24

mare profile match in and of itself would not take the

25

substitute -- it would not be a substitute for that sort

of individualized suspicion.

Its appearance on the

2 profile may or may not have significance , but the mere
3

fact that it does appear on the profile cannot be used

4

as a substitute to make the determination that in fact a

5

suspcion of a crime has been committed.

There still

6 must be something that is articulated as to why —

QUESTION:

7

On your approach, a profile has no

8 use whatsoever.

MR. KLEIN:

9

No, I believe that it has a very,

10

very useful approach, to single out from the very large

11

universe of people those whom there is some unusual

12

activity that would cause the police then to go and

13

conduct a further inquiry.

It worked pretty well here.
Well, I think we must look at

things at the point prior to the search.

Otherwise —

20 we can't look at it afterwards as a bootstrapping sort
21

of thing, because in every case in which there is a — a

22 criminal case in which there is a motion to suppress, it
23

means that it works, but the determination still must be

Yes.

That is quite a lot for two

MR. KLEIN*

11
12 Honor.

They were heavy suitcases. Your

There is no doubt about it.

But the fact that

13 somebody is carrying heavy suitcases does not give one
14 the kind of articulable suspicion that a crime is being
15 committed.

17

MR. KLEIN*

18

QUESTION*

Not standing alone.
Pardon me.
Not standing alone.

But it is one

19 of the factors, you would concede.
20
21

MR. KLEIN*

Your Honor, it is a factor, but it

still does not show why a crime has been committed.

The

22 fact that it is American Tourister, or that it is a

23 heavy suitcase, the fact that the person looked nervous
24 — and by the'way, there is a case that says — pointed
25 out as one of the characteristics that the defendant

55

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

looked very calm, so again, there is a contradiction to

2 every single one of these items that occurs.

QUESTION:

3
4

Well, then I say again that in your

position the profile is perfectly useless.
MR. KLEINj

5

No, I believe that it is very

6 useful for the police to go and to make the initial
7

contact so that they don't have to just select people

8 out at random to see whether or not they are drug
9
10

couriers in an airport, and at that point, then, they
would go and mak.e their contact.
Now, if the state and the government are

fearful of a person getting away with crime, the police

don't have to shrug their shoulders and simply walk

Now, Justice Stewart said that is

MR. KLEIN;

situation that we have here, and I think again in order

14

to determine --

15

17

QUESTION;

Well, ona of the government’s

arguments is that it is.
MR. KLEIN;

Your Honor, that’s correct, but I

18

think in order to determine these issues of the scope of

19

the Terry seizure, that we have got to go back and look

20 at the Terry poll stars, and see what it is that is
21

sought to be accomplished, and one of the things that

22 must be determined is how far we can extend this Terry
23

stop without running afoul of the original principle.

24

The whole object of all of the Terry cases,

25

including the investigative stop cases, is that the

59

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

scope of the intrusion must be limited to the reason for

2 the initial seizure, anl that is what justified the
3

Terry rationale in the first place.
Now, if we limit that under these

circumstances to the Terry seizure, then I think it is

6 clear that whatever occurs should occur out there in the
7 concourse.

It is constitutionally unreasonable to take

QUESTION;

Why should the test of a seizure be

10

what the seizee reasonably thought about whether he was

12

NR. KLEIN;

13

QUESTION;

Why should it be?
Yes, because on that basis, you

14

probably will never permit the police to go up to

15

anybody and say, may I ask you a question.

16

NR. KLEIN;

Your Honor, I agree, but that is

17

what the Court has said, that that is the test, because

18

I don’t think there’s any way --

19

QUESTION;

Why shouldn’t it rest on some act

20 of compulsion or show of force by the police?
21

NR. KLEIN;

Your Honor, the cases have said

22 the question is whether or not the "seizee” is under the
23

reasonable belief that he was not free to walk away.

24

think it's a very, very difficult rationale to apply,

25

but nevertheless that is the standard that this Court

I

MR. KLEIN;

but the question has always been stated under whether or

8 not the seizee -9

QUESTION;

In on.e case, have five Justices

10

agreed to that?

11

by one other Justice in Mendenhall.

12

It was Justice Stewart's opinion joined

SR. KLEIN;

All right.

My own feeling is that

13

that is an unworkable standard, that it ought to be a

14

standard as to whether or not — whether or not some act

15

is done by the police officer that would reasonably

16

indicate that the defendant was not free to go, not the

17

subjective standard of what was in the defendant’s mind,

18

because that's an impossible standard to apply, and I

19

think that looking at it from the standpoint of the law

20 enforcement authorities rather than from the subjective
21

22

standard of the defendant makes a lot more sense.
And looking at it from that standard, if a

23

police officer asks an individual on the street or

24

anywhere, can I see your license, it is unreasonable to

25

believe that the person thinks that he can freely walk

61

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION;

Can they retain the man's ticket

4 while they do the questioning,

in your view?

5

MR. KLEIN;

Your Honor, if it's a seizure on

6 the spot,

I think that they could retain his ticket.

7 That would be a means of holding him on a leash, because
8 if there is a proper Terry seizure in the first
9 instance, then I would think that under those
10 circumstances it would be reasonable to hold their
11

ticket while they are questioning him on the spot, but

12 if

they are going to attempt to remove him to some other

13 place, then in order to expand

that, they've got to have

14 some legitimate reason why it is necessary to go to

abandon any arguments we raise in our extensive brief,

22 including the good faith exception.

I would like to

address why the voluntariness issue in this Court should

24

be overturned, and that is, this Court's various

25

holdings, and we quote United States versus Price that a

65

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

finding of consent should not be overturned unless it is

2 clearly erroneous.

The evidence in this case is not so

3

overwhelming that either this Court or the District

4

Court of Appeal an banc should overturn both the panel

5

opinion and the trial court on the question of

6 voluntariness.
7

The defendant just stated that this was a

8 police room, and the witnesses so testified.
9

In fact,

Johnson was asked, "Is that an official police room.

10

No, it's a closet that has shelves on one end.

11

have any police paraphernalia whatsoever in that room?

12

No, because it's an area that we really couldn't secure

18

-- assuming the defendant was detained — excuse me —

19

when he was taken to the room, he was not detained

20 because he had American Tourister luggage,
21

Your Honor.

He was detained because of numerous facts and

22 circumstances, not the least of which included the
23

profile as a written indication of the officers'

24

experience, and particularly his efforts to avoid

25

detection as are observed by the officers, and

67

1

particularly Johnson's observations of the defendant's

2 countersurveillance, if you will.

Certainly, normal

3

airline passengers don't conduct countersurveillance to

4

see if they are being observed.
QUESTION;

5

When did they discover that he was

6 using a false name, at least a different name?

SR. FOXi

7

The alias was discovered at the very

8 moment of the initial contact with the defendant, Your
9

Honor, and that alias, Elmore, and Partino, cited in our

10

brief, Elmore said, "It would be a failure of duty had

11

the federal agents not detained Elmore at that point to

12

investigate him further."

13

investigate further, which, assuming this was a

14

detention, that it was absolutely lawful under Elmore.

15

Elmore also said, "Upon these facts, profile

Now, that is detained to

16

or no profile, the officers also had a right to ask the

17

defendant if he would consent to the search of his

18

luggage."

19

Patino reached exactly a similar result.
With respect to the test to be applied, Your

20 Honors, there's a two-part test here that we've argued
21

in our brief.

First of all, Terry and Mendenhall held

22 that there is no detention unless there is physical
23

force or a show of authority, and neither one of those

24

circumstances was present in this case.
