ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Kramer, I think you

MR. KRAMER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The Court today is revisiting an area that it
has visited in such cases as Geduldig v. Aiello, General

10

Electric Company v. Gilbert, Nashville Gas Company v.

11

Satty, and to a somewhat lesser degree, the decision of

12

Los Angeles Department of Water and Power v. Manhart.

13

Unlike those cases, however, the claim of

14

discrimination here is not being brought on behalf of

15

female employees.

16

the question of what benefits are to be provided their

17

spouses for hospitalization costs incurred as a result

18

of childbirth.

19

This case involves male employees and

In deciding this question the Court for the

20

first time is asked to analyze the scope of the

21

Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, an act passed as a

22

direct result of this Court's decision in Gilbert.

23

The Shipyard in this case has a comprehensive

24

group health insurance plan.

The plan covers employees,

25

their spouses, and unmarried children up to the age of

19 years
Prior to the passage of the PDA, the Shipyard

3

covered female employees and the spouses of male

4

employees identically with respect to preganancy

5

hospitalization costs.

6

provided hospitalization costs incurred as a result of

7

normal childbirth of up to $500 with full prenatal

8

expenses taken care of, physician and anesthesiologist

9

costs, and major medical coverage in the event of

Under that plan, the Shipyard

pregnancy complications.
As a result of the PDA, however, the Shipyard

12

removed the $500 cap with respect to its female

13

employees, but retained the cap with respect to the

14

spouses of its male employees.

15

remove this cap which the Government alleges constitutes

16

intentional compensation discrimination against male

17

employees under Section 703(a) of Title VII.

18

It is the failure to

At the outset it’s important to note that the

19

Government's position here has not been a model of

20

consistency, indeed has been ever-changing.

21

Congress considered the PDA, Drew Days, then Assistant

22

Attorney General for Civil Rights, and the Deputy

23

General Counsel of the EEOC testified in House hearings,

24

pursuant to a question, that they did not believe that

25

the PDA was intended to govern the question of

When

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

dependents or their coverage.
The EEOC, when it promulgated its very

3

question and answers dealing with the issue of dependent

4

coverage for male employees, stated that the issue was

5

not resolved by the PDA, but rather had to be resolved

6

under existing Title VII principles.

7

We contend, as submitted in our briefs, that

8

both the language of the statute and its legislative

9

history show that the PDA itself does not govern this

10

issue, and that the PDA itself does not make this

11

Shipyard's insurance plan unlawful on its face.

12

In amending Title VII with respect to the PDA,

13

Congress did not add a new substantive provision or make

14

it a new separate act, but rather chose to amend the

15

definitional section, and added as a definition under

16

Section 701, 701(k), the first clause of which reads

17

"that the terms because of sex or on the basis of sex

18

include, but are not limited to, because of on the basis

19

of pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions."

20

Except for the Fourth Circuit in the Instant

21

case, all other courts which have construed this

22

language have interpreted this provision to be simply

23

definitional, and that it must be read into the

24

substantive provisions of Title VII.

25

in the same testimony that he gave to the House as

Indeed, Drew Days

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-9300

1

Assistant Attorney General in support of the PDA noted

2

that in fact on pages 171 and I believe 172 of the House

3

hearings that in fact what Congress was doing with those

4

terms was putting them into the substantive provisions

5

of Title VII.

6

If Congress had felt otherwise, it is curious

7

why Congress would have put the terms "because of sex or

8

on the basis of sex" in quotation marks, since those

9

terms, while not the specific language, but the terms

10

"because of” and "on the basis of" are found throughout

11

Section 703 of Title VII, which are the very sections

12

requiring employers, labor organizations, other

13

individuals to take certain affirmative steps with

14

respect to equal opportunity.

QUESTION;

16

MR. KRAMER;

17

QUESTION;

Mr. Kramer —

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
-- On your argument you're asking

18

us to — to look back at the provisions of Title VII,

19

basically, to see the answer to this inquiry.

20

me ask you whether you think it would be a violation of

21

Title VII for an employer to furnish medical coverage

22

for wives of employees but not for husbands.

23

MR. KRAMER;

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. KRAMER;

And let

Is that a Title VII violation?

2

there are cases — in fact, cases prior to Gilbert --

3

dealing with spousal benefits where —

And I think clearly

Well, if that’s so, then how does

5

this case differ?

6

problem and just tell me how this differs from that

7

situation.

9

I mean you can forget the pregnancy

MR. KRAMER;

Because the Government says that

on its face, Your Honor, in this case we are required to

10

provide, even where we provide spousal benefits to the

11

spouses of males -- males and females, that we have an

12

additional affirmative obligation.

13

benefits, we must also provide for hospitalization

14

benefits for pregnancy.

15

If we provide those

As in this case, hospitalization benefits

16

happen to be provided to a substantial degree.

17

Government says that degree isn't enough because the PDA

18

requires you to cover it fully.

19

doesn’t violate Title VII.

20

is the same in this case.

21

record that a male employee is receiving less

22

compensation than his female counterpart.

23

The

Our position is that

The employees' compensation
There is no showing in this

Now, the Government's position is not the one

you articulated, Justice O'Connor.

The Government's

25

position is not having to do with providing one sex or

the other no benefits or some benefit.

2

position is if you provide equal benefits, as ve contend

3

are provided with respect to pregnancy, you have to

provide additional coverage, additional risk coverage.

And I think that’s — but we would believe that you look

to Title VII.

PDA.

9

The Government’s

We’re not contending this isn't a Title

We’re simply saying it's not governed by the

In fact, interestingly enough, Your Honor, if

10

you take a look at the second clause of the PDA, which

11

we believe amplifies congressional intent, it also to

12

some degree answers your question.

13

"Women affected by pregnancy shall be treated the same

14

for fringe benefit purposes or employment-related

15

purposes, including the receipt of fringe benefits, as

16

other persons not so affected but similar in their

17

ability and inability to work."

18

That clause says,

The Government would have us believe that for

19

the first time Congress has made an express mandate in

20

Title VII that the term "other persons" and "women

21

affected" are not terms limited to employees or

22

applicants to employment.

23

according to the Government, has revolutionized Title

24

VII by directly affecting spousal behavior or employer

25

obligations with respect to spouses and dependents.

For the first time Congress,

1

We contend, Your Honor, that the PDA cannot be

2

read that way; that the PDA in terms of a logical

3

document within Title VII itself and its legislative

4

history cannot support that.

5

Now, what is remaining, however, is the

6

question of — and by the way, it's cited in both

7

briefs; they're replete with references to the

8

legislative history.

9

deciding Gilbert, the Court noted that the legislative

And I would just note when

10

history with respect to the sex discrimination ban

11

original in Title VII was relatively sparse.

12

contend with all the documents that are cited in the

13

brief, the legislative history with respect to the PDA

14

was anything but sparse.

15

clearly evidenced its concern that this Court's decision

16

in Gilbert operated as a direct barrier to women workers

17

in the work force.

18

I would

And that in fact Congress

And the second clause was put in, I believe,

19

and if one reads the legislative history by Congress,

20

for the fact that Gilbert was more than one holding.

21

Gilbert did not just go off on gender.

22

went off on the question of whether or not there was

23

discriminatory effects, whether the given health

24

insurance plan in that case actually provided more or

25

less benefits.

case was that women were receiving -- that is, the case

of Gilbert -- that women were receiving more benefits.

I would contend that the similarity between a

10

are entirely dissimilar, and the individuals are not

11

only similarly situated, but the individuals and the

12

policy considerations with respect to them are quite

13

varied and distinct.

14

The hearings on the PDA in fact emphasized

15

this fact -- the cost added — that is now relied upon

16

by the Government so extensively in its brief.

17

interesting to me that the Government in its brief cites

18

the Senate report indicating -- and this is at pages 32

19

and 33 of the Government's brief, Note 32 -- indicating

20

support for the proposition that Congress in considering

21

the cost of the PDA obviously considered the cost of

22

both dependents as well as employees.

23

fact that the Senate report in a footnote noted that it

24

found certain plans to be perfectly legal and other

25

plans to be discriminatory.

It is

And it cites the

And it said in their brief

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that those plans encompass both employees, dependents

2

and spouses.

3

The Government, however, forgot to add the

4

following words that fit in that footnote:

5

percentage of women employees are covered by such

6

discriminatory plans cannot be calculated."

7

of Congress when it came to cost, when it came to

8

concern as to why there was a need for the PDA, was not

9

male employees.

10

"What

The focus

The Senate report expressly noted that the

11

issue of dependent coverage of male employees would have

12

to be decided not on the basis of the PDA but on

13

existing Title VII principles — a position earlier

14

adopted by the EEOC but subsequently changed during the

15

course of this and other litigation.

16

Now the -- and one other point I would make.

17

One significant colloquy during the Senate debates

18

occurred between Senators Hatch and Senator Williams.

19

Senator Williams, of course, was the chairman of the

20

committee having primary responsibility for the bill.

21

Senator Williams was probably the primary sponsor and

22

member of the Senate's conference committee team.

23

Senator Williams was asked directly by Senator

24

Hatch whether if the terms "women affected by pregnancy"

25

only refers to employees and no -- or women employees

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

and no one else.

QUESTION;

2
3

MR. KRAMER;

QUESTION:

Is that your -- is that your

reading ?
MR. KRAMER;

8

9

Under that reading it would be,

Your Honor.

6
7

Does that mean that job applicants

are not covered?

4
5

Senator Williams said "Exactly."

It’s not our position, no.

Our

position was that perhaps the term "other person" --

10

excuse me -- could applicants for employment within the

11

meaning of 703(a)(2).
QUESTION;

12

13

I thought your emphatic reliance on

this meant women employees only and not applicants.
MR. KRAMER:

14

Well, our emphatic reliance is

15

because I think it's a pretty direct quote on the

16

issue.

17

Senator Hatch considered them to be having a nexus in

18

the employment process or not, I'm not sure.

19

seems to me clearly the first clause governs applicants,

20

because the first clause directly goes into 703(a)(2).

21

I think with respect to applicants, whether

But it

703(a)(2) by its very terms speaks not just

22

with respect to employees but of applicants for

23

employment.

24

— and by the way, it is possible, Your Honor, that the

25

second clause dees not in fact cover applicants, since

So regardless of whether or not the mandate

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

applicants would probably never enjoy a disability or

2

fringe benefit until they became an employee.
So I think Senator Williams might have given

3
4

the exact answer with respect to that clause, since that

5

clause is specifically tied to fringe benefits,

6

something that, would normally not be enjoyed by an

7

applicant.
I think then the critical question for the

8
9

Court is what principles should the Court apply and what

10

are the principles if the PDA doesn't govern, because we

11

have a Title VII case.

12

has expressly rejected, at least in part, the notion

13

that pregnancy should be unprotected with respect to

14

Title VII.

15

we fashion in this case a remedy.

We have a case where Congress

So the question is what remains, and how do

16

Well, first of all, I think it’s important to

17

recognize that this Court has never held that pregnancy

18

classifications are without protection.

19

has held in cases such as Satty, and in Gilbert, is that

20

pregnancy classifications on its face is not per se

21

discriminatory.

22

concurring Justices who noted, in fact, that their

23

concurrences were on the basis that it was not a per se

24

violation and that therefore the Government had the

25

burden, or in that case private plaintiffs, of proof.

What this Court

In Gilbert there were at least two

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Row, the Government here, interestingly

1
2

enough, in its complaint alleges not a violation of

3

701(k), but rather alleges a violation of 703(a) of

4

Title VII, and most specifically the compensation

5

provisions of 703(a)(1), and goes on to allege

6

intentional discrimination, of which there is absolutely

7

no proof in this record.
So what do we have from the principles of this

8

9

Court that can be applied to resolve this case?

First,

10

this Court has recognized, as I said before, that the

11

issue was not simply whether pregnancy is made a

12

classifying factor, but whether discrimination has

13

occurred.

14

The Court has never held that a limitation or

15

exclusion of pregnancy itself constitutes a per se

16

violation of the act.

17

Gilbert, Satty and Manhart, there is a need for a

18

plaintiff to show that there is in fact a difference in

19

compensation.

20
21

QUESTION;

As shown in such cases as

Mr. Kramer, may I interrupt you

with one question?

22

MR. KRAMER;

23

QUESTION;

Yes, Justice Stevens.
In view of the legislative history

24

of the Pregnancy Disability Act, to what extent is it

25

proper — and I*m not sure one way or another on this --

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 623-9300

1

but to what extent do you think it's proper to rely on

2

the Gilbert case as authority, because they expressly

3

said they thought Gilbert had misread the statute.
MR. KRAMER:

4

To me, Your Honor, I think it's

5

proper to read Gilbert from the standpoint of saying

6

that there is still a burden — that pregnancy per se

7

with respect to dependents we’re talking about, is not a

8

per se classification, and that there must be a showing

9

that in fact discrimination occurred.

And we put an

10

example — for an example, because I think this ties in

11

to how the Court evolved from Gilbert; it went from

12

Gilbert to Satty -- where, for example, Justice Powell

13

in his concurring opinion in a footnote noted he thought

14

Gilbert dealt with the question of equality of

15

compensation•
Manhart related the fact that in Gilbert there

16
17

was no showing that the plan was worth more to men than

18

to women.

19

still stands.

And to me I think that portion of Gilbert

QUESTION:

20

Well, to the extent that there’s a

21

conflict between Justice Brennan’s opinion and Justice

22

Rehnquist’s in Gilbert, which should we follow in this

23

case ?

24
25

MR. KRAMER;

Well, I would say Justice

Rehnquist, because it seems to me the portions of

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Justice Brennan’s opinion which were followed, just as

2

your dissent in Gilbert was followed, was followed for

3

the policy reason that wording women were the ones being

4

disadvantaged.
I'm not sure what the result would have been,

5
6

and I certainly would be the last person to guess, if it

7

was a male employee who was contending that his spouse

8

was being discriminated when Gilbert came up.
The fact of the matter is I think the policy

9
10

considerations are entirely different.

You noted in

11

your dissent in Gilbert that the risk — it was an equal

12

risk coverage because the woman would still be absent

13

from work with no income.
Those types of considerations have no

14
15

application, from my perspective, to the spouse of a

16

male.
QUESTION*

17

Well -- well, I understand — I

18

understand -- I understand the argument, but it presents

19

a very interesting problem of statutory interpretation

20

where you have Congress — we have a decided case

21

interpreting Title VII, and Congress said they disagreed

22

with it.

23

a very difficult —

And I don't know — I mean I — I — it's just

24

MR. KRAMER*

25

QUESTION:

I think, Your Honor —
— And unusual problem.

MR. KRAMERi

1

Yes, it is.

But I think, Your

2

Honor, there’s one part of the legislative history you

3

can look at.

4

decision were in fact consistent with what they were

5

doing.

6

framework.

7

Congress felt that portions of the Satty

And I think Satty, as I said, evolves better

What I'm contending here is the Government in

8

this case alleged intentional discrimination.

9

didn't allege the PDA per se.

They

They alleged under

10

Section 703(a), intentional discrimination, of which,

11

Your Honor, there is no proof.

12

The Shipyard's insurance program covers a

13

number of risks.

14

As in the case of pregnancy benefit, it limits certain

15

coverage of certain risks.

16

It also includes a number of risks.

As recognized in Manhart, when insurance risks

17

are grouped, the better risk always subsidizes the

18

poorer ones, the healthy versus the unhealthy, the

19

single versus the married, the individual with smaller

20

family size will subsidize the individuals with larger

21

family size.

22

The monetary value of this plan is perceived

23

by the Government and the court below to essentially be

24

the fact that Mr. McNulty had to go into his pocket,

25

pull out some money because of the fact that this plan

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

only covered pregnancy for $500 for hospital expenses,

2

but as shown in the appendix, certain individuals

3

received far more because the plan is more generous than

4

just $500, and that a female employee with a spouse

5

would never have to do it.

6

Well, it's true.

A female employee with a

7

spouse probably never has to face the risk of pregnancy

8

for that spouse.

9

being offered here covers risk identically.

That is clearly true.

But the plan
The same

10

plan that Mr. McNulty has is the same one given to a

11

female employee.

12

coverage of these plans are equal except for one fact:

13

when it comes to the spousal component of this plan,

14

male employees with pregnant spouses are covered for an

15

additional risk.

MRS. SHAPIROi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

2

please the Court
First, I want to summarize briefly our theory

3

of the case which is based on our reading of the

4

Pregnancy Discrimination Act as establishing that

5

discrimination based on pregnancy is discrimination

6

based on sex.

7

we believe that is the correct way to read the statute.

8

9

Having done that, I will then discuss why

Title VII requires that employees must be paid
without discrimination on the basis of sex.

Fringe

10

benefits are part of that pay, including, of course,

11

insurance plans that reimburse employees for their

12

family medical expenses.

13

An employer cannot offer its male employees

14

less health insurance than its female employees.

15

Therefore, an insurance plan that provides less generous

16

coverage to male employees for their families than is

17

provided to female employees for their families violates

18

Title VII, because on its face it discriminates between

19

male and female employees on the basis of sex.

20

principle, we submit, is the one that was established in

21

cases like Frontiero, Wiesenfeld and Wengler.

22

For example —

QUESTION:

That

So even without the Pregnancy

24

Disability Act you take the position that it's covered

MSS. SHAPIRO;

1

Well, only if the

2

discrimination based on sex is discrimination based on

3

-- I mean discrimination based on pregnancy is

4

discrimination based on sex.
For example, a plan that covers 25 days of

5
6

hospitalization for husbands but only 20 days for wives

7

would violate Title VII, because male employees, the

8

only ones who have wives, would get smaller fringe

9

benefits than female employees.

But a plan that covered

10

25 days for sons and 20 days for daughters wouldn't

11

violate Title VII, because both male and female

12

employees may have daughters, so that plan would affect

13

male and female employees equally.

14

A. plan that singles out spousal pregnancies

15

and provides less generous coverage for them than for

16

other dependent medical expenses has precisely the same

17

effect as an express limitation on benefits for wives

18

and violates Title VII for precisely the same reason if

19

distinctions based on pregnancy are distinctions based

20

on sex.

21

to establish.

We submit that that’s what the PDA was enacted

The plain language of the statute supports

22

23

that view.

The Pregnancy Discrimination Act amended the

24

general definition section of Title VII, providing

25

expressly that discriminations because of pregnancy are

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

discriminations because of sex.
Nothing in the language of the statute

2
3

suggests that general principle applies only to female

4

employees.

5

definition, the statute says that women affected by

6

pregnancy, not female employees affected by pregnancy,

7

shall be treated the same for all employment-related

8

purposes, including fringe benefits, as other persons,

9

not employees, not so affected.

10

Indeed, in explaining the effect of the new

If Congress had intended to limit the new

11

definition to women employees, it surely would not have

12

referred to — it would have referred to employees

13

instead of to women and persons.

14

Petitioner argues that "because of pregnancy"

15

is simply to be read into the substantive provisions

16

that prohibit discrimination on the basis of such

17

individual sex, but that substitution argument is

18

unpersuasive for several reasons.

19

First, it turns Title VII into a statute that

20

requires special treatment for women workers, although

21

the fundamental purpose of Title VII has always been to

22

provide for the equality of treatment of all workers.

23

And it’s particularly significant that in enacting the

24

Pregnancy Discrimination Act, Congress emphasized that

25

it was not intended to change the basic principles of

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Title VII law regarding sex discrimination, and also

2

that it was not intended to require special benefits for

3

women workers.

4

Second, petitioner's argument assumes that

5

Congress meant to say that the denial of benefits for

6

pregnancies of female workers was sex-based, while the

7

denial of benefits for the pregnancies of spouses was

8

gender neutral.

9

view of pregnancy that Congress said that it was

10

And that's not the kind of common sense

enacting in the Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

11

Third, petitioner is asking for a narrowly

12

literal reading of the first clause of the Pregnancy

13

Discrimination Act, but such a narrow literal reading

14

makes no sense, because, in fact, the substantive

15

provisions of Title VII nowhere contain the precise

16

phrase "because of sex" or "on the basis of sex."

17

there -- if you read it as literally as he wishes us to,

18

there is nowhere to substitute the new language.

19

So

Finally, even if you can read an ellipsis into

20

the statute, the substitution approach would mean that

21

only the federal government would be precluded from

22

limiting spousal pregnancy benefits, because only

23

Section 717 of Title VII, which applies to the federal

24

government, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex

25

rather than on the basis of such individual's sex.

2U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Turning to the second clause, petitioner has

1

2

never attempted to explain the reference to women and

3

persons rather than employees.

4

the reference to "similar in their ability or inability

5

to work" and argues that that phrase must be read as a

6

restriction of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act to

7

female employees, as if it read "similar in their

8

ability or inability to work for the particular employer

9

involved."

10

Instead, he focuses on

Of course, it doesn't say that.
We submit that in context that phrase must be

11

read as a functional description of the way pregnancy is

12

to be treated, like any other condition that affects a

13

person's ability to do whatever work she normally

14

performs, whether that's housework or any other work.

15

Indeed, the legislative history shows that a major aim

16

of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is to require that

17

pregnancy be treated like any other functionally

18

comparable disabling condition.

19

out for special limitations.

20

It may not be singled

I'd like to turn now to the legislative

21

history, particularly the discussion in the Senate

22

report of the effect of the Pregnancy Discrimination

23

Act's amendment of Title VII on medical benefits for

24

dependents.

25

That discussion recognizes that at some future

25

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

date the kind of question now involved in this case may

2

arise; that is, whether an employer health insurance

3

plan that covers dependents of employees may limit

4

pregnancy coverage for those dependents.
Instead of providing a direct answer to that

5

6

question, the report says that it is to be decided by

7

applying existing Title VII principles.

8

that means Title VII principles as clarified by the

9

Pregnancy Discrimination Act.

QUESTION:

Rather than existing today when

we’re speaking.

HRS. SHAPIRO:

I think it's also significant, though, that

That's right.

even if you say it meant existing at the day they were

10

speaking, what they thought were existing Title VII

11

principles, in fact, in that — that — the discussion

12

of the medical benefits is at pages 5 — page 5 of the

13

legislative history, 5 and 6.

14

— I mean of the Senate report -- on page 3 of the

15

Senate report, just a few pages before, there's a

16

section that is entitled "The Basic Principles."

17

that section starts out, it says,

18

to make plain that under Title VII of the Civil Rights

19

Act of 1964 discrimination based on pregnancy,

20

childbirth and related medical conditions is

21

discrimination based on sex.

22

'sex discrimination' as proscribed in the existing

23

statute to include those physiological occurrences

peculiar to women.

25

of Title VII to sex discrimination in any other way.

But then at page 3 of the

intended to do was to establish at least two principles,

14

and these principles the Congress indeed had thought

15

were always part of Title VII;

for petitioner's slain that the reference to existing

2

Title VII principles was an invitation to the courts to

3

apply the rationale of Gilbert to spousal pregnancy

benefits.

5

The legislative history is in fact remarkably

consistent in rejecting the rationale of Gilbert.

7

reason for the enactment of the Pregnancy Discrimination

was to aiopt the rationale of the dissenters in Gilbert,

and that pregnancy discrimination is, on its face, sex

16

think petitioner's problem probably is that they see the

— the Pregnancy Discrimination Act as somehow in

conflict with Title VII, whereas in fact it is an

amendment of Title VII.

20

it was — that Title VII -- that it was to be

Our submission is simply that the same thing

applies to male employees.

So that as far as the

equality of costs and the -- argument that — and,

15

again, petitioner is simply asking this Court to apply

Gilbert even though, as we submit, the Pregnancy

applied are those of the dissenters in Gilbert rather

19

than of Gilbert — the Gilbert majority.

And, clearly, our

quite significant precisely because the -- this was the

statement by the officials who were responsible for

interpreting the PDA as in the Title VII which it

10

amended, stating what they thought was the correct

interpretation of the statute.

Going to the question, though,

like to leave one point.

The saconi clause of the PDA clearly mandated

that employer fringe benefit programs put pregnancy

value, treat pregnancy the same as you would treat any

MR. KRAMER;

Yes.

The question you get to

16

there is is whether or not the pregnancy classification

17

itself is a sex-based classification, which means you're

18

discriminating, whether you discriminate against the

19

spouse or the employee.

20

Our position here as to why it is not sex

21

discrimination within the meaning of Title VII goes a

22

little further, because it's not just the question --

23

position of the Government here that there is a

24

classification of pregnancy which they contend is sex

25

discrimination.

It's that that classification has
