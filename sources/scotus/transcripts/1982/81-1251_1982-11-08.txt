ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. WESSEL, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9

MR. WESSEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the case before you today is a case

10

involving a public employee who was dismissed from

11

service because of actions surrounding a job movement,

12

that is, moving an assistant district attorney from one

13

section of the court to another section of the court in

14

the Orleans Parish criminal justice system.

15

The action to transfer the assistant district

16

attorney was followed up by the assistant district

17

attorney circulating a questionnaire, which is in the

18

record, which pertained — over 90 percent of the

19

questionnaire pertained to matters surrounding the

20

transfer, and one question pertained to a question about

21

the integrity or the confidence that other assistant

22

district attorneys may or may not have had in the

23

supervising trial assistant who took part in the

24

decision to have him transferred.

25

Another question in the questionnaire outside

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of the questions that directly pertained to the transfer

2

was a question as to whether or not the other assistant

3

district attorneys felt pressured to engage in political

4

campaigns.

5

The central issue around this case falls on

6

Pickering, decided by this Court, and Pickering left us

no standards in a case where a public employee is

8

terminated for voicing concerns that he could voice or

9

would voice as a private citizen on matters of

10

legitimate public concern.

11

circuits any standards by which to determine what is a

12

matter of legitimate public concern.

13

The Court has not left the

By reason of that, the circuits have gone

14

askew in determining what is a matter of public concern,

15

and in some instances have done the balancing required

16

by Pickering in order to determine what is a matter of

17

public concern.

bond issue and how -- why the bond issue should or

20

should not be voted upon by the population.

22

bond issue.

In Pickering, of course, we had a

Court, we had an employee setting rather than a

this Court to determine whether or not there was another

3

reason for the firing in that case.

4

That matter was remanded by

In this particular case, we have an employee

5

setting again, rather than a public setting, but we have

6

a questionnaire pertaining to a private quarrel or petty

7

bickering of the employee pertaining to a transfer of

8

that assistant district attorney from one section of

9

court to another section of court.
The questionnaire throughout points out the

10

11

culmination of the events that took place prior to the

12

questionnaire being circulated, and it is important in

13

that regard to determine — to look at the facts as they

14

were presented at the trial level.
The evening before the distribution of the

15
16

questionnaire, the assistant district attorney in this

17

case was told that she was going to be transferred to

18

another section of court and was given a written memo to

19

that effect.

20

the first assistant district attorney that evening with

21

a complaint on it, why didn't you tell me about it

22

before, and with an indication that her name was spelled

23

wrong .

The written memo was returned by her to

24

The next morning, she had been visited by the

25

district attorney himself at approximately 8:00 or 8:30

in the morning, in the courtroom where she had her

2

office, with a personal request to acquiesce in the

3

decision to transfer her from one section of court to

4

the other.
The district attorney had come from home, had

He was home with a sick

He was informed by the first

10

assistant that the assistant district attorney, Ms.

11

Myers, had told him she would not accept the transfer

12

and would not move to the other section of court.

13

This was an intervening event that took place

14

between his personal request of Ms. Myers in her section

15

of court that morning.

16

noon, the first assistant called the district attorney

17

and told him, Ms. Myers is circulating a questionnaire,

18

and she is creating a mini-insurrection, what do you

19

want me to do about it?

20

district attorney, returned to the office and he

21

inquired of the questionnaire, was informed by the chief

22

of trials under whom Ms. Myers was to be transferred

23

that he had spoken to Ms. Myers and she told him she

24

wasn't going to accept the transfer, that she was going

25

to quit rather than accept the transfer.

Later on that morning, at about

Whereupon, Mr. Connick, the

The questionnaire was then circulated, and Kr

1

2

Connick, of course, had returned to the office, and at

3

that point in time he informed her that she was fired.

4

Ms. Myers testified and Mr. Connick testified that she

5

was being fired for two reasons, for refusing to accept

6

the transfer and refusing — for refusing to accept the

7

transfer and for having circulated the questionnaire

8

with a — or a question in the questionnaire being

9

particularly offensive to the district attorney at the

10

time pertaining to the integrity of the six chiefs,

11

chief assistants who had participated in the decision to

12

transfer the individual.

13

QUESTION*

Mr. Wessel, does the record show

14

what the structure of the district attorney's office was

15

with respect to the chain of authority below the

16

district attorney himself?

17

chiefs —

18

ME. WESSEL:

You just said there were six

Yes, Mr. Justice, there was

19

testimony that the chief — two chiefs of trials, the

20

chief of screening, and the training officer as well as

21

the first assistant.

22

was the first assistant, the chief of the screening

23

division, that is, the intake division, two chiefs of

24

trials, that is, the operational trial under which Ms.

25

Myers was operating at that particular time, and the

training officer.
2UE3TI0N:

3

So Ms. Myers served under one of

the two chiefs of trials?

4

ME. WESSEL;

Yes, Mr. Justice.

She was being

5

moved from one chief of trials to another chief of

6

trials.

7

QUESTIONS

And the line of authority went from

8

the chief of trials to the first assistant and then to

9

the district attorney?

10

ME. WESSELs

11

QUESTION:

That is correct, Mr. Justice.
May I just clarified one thing?

12

You have reviewed the facts.

13

the findings of the district court as clearly

14

erroneous?
MR. WESSELs

15

Do you challenge any of

Yes, Mr. Justice.

There is

16

certainly challenge insofar — in two respects, that the

17

— insofar as the Mount Healthy but for inquiry, as to

18

the inquiry where there is a dual reason for the firing,

19

the court below did not address itself to the dual

20

reasons.

21

said.

22

inquire either in terms of balancing or in terms of the

23

but for test of Mount Healthy, as to the other reason,

24

the non-First Amendment reason, i.e., the setting in

25

which the questionnaire was distributed, the transfer of

The court below found the real reason, as he

The trial court said the real reason, but did not

the assistant from one section of court to the other.
The Pickering, as I earlier pointed out, the

2
3

Pickering situation was a one-reason firing, not a

4

two-reason firing.

5

was one reason there.

There was no other reason.

QUESTION*

6

There

Well, isn't it fair — didn't you

7

argue — this was argued to the district judge, wasn't

8

it, that the transfer was the real reason?
MR. WES3EL*

9

QUESTION*

10

That is correct, Mr. Justice.
And when he did not enter such a

11

finding and only found one reason, the — and he says it

12

in so many words, that she was fired because of the

13

questionnaire, isn't that a — didn't he — don't we

14

have to assume he rejected the second reason?
MR. WESSEL:

15

Well, Mr. Justice, there are two

16

problems with that.

17

other reason.

18

not do the threshold inquiry of Pickering insofar as

19

whether this questionnaire was a matter of public

20

concern.

21

Number One, he didn't address the

Number Two, he didn't inquire — he did

The — that is what —
QUESTION*

Well,

that goes to whether it's

22

protected by the First Amendment, and all the rest, but

23

as to — his findings on motivation I thought were

24

rather clear, that he considered all the evidence

25

pertaining to the transfer and said that the real reason

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

was the questionnaire

2

MB. WESSEL;

3

Justice# in that regard.
QUESTION;

4
5

I would say that is correct# Mr.

You are saying that that is a

clearly erroneous finding?
MR. WESSEL;

6

Clearly erroneous for several

7

reasons.

Number One# he didn't address the factual

8

underlying reasons. ' There was no — He addressed the

9

motivation of the district attorney without addressing

10

the motivation of the employee who circulated the

11

questionnaire.

12

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Wessel, I have a little

13

trouble understanding your position in the light of your

14

responses to Justice Stevens' question.

15

complaint basically that he didn't address the question#

16

or that he decided it the wrong way?

17

MR. WESSEL;

Is it your

My complaint is that he — by not

18

addressing it, he did decide it the wrong way, and of

19

course I recognize the decision of facts on the factual

20

underlying basis is not reviewable, but the ultimate

21

question as to the protected activity would be.

22

QUESTION;

Well, supposing in a negligence

23

case one side is arguing that something happened on

24

Friday, and the other is arguing it happened on

25

Saturday# and there is a bench trial# and the judge

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

says, I fini it happened on Saturday.

2

nothing about it not having happened on Friday, but

3

certainly that would be a rejection of the claim that it

4

happened on Friday.

5

HR. WESSEL*

Now, he says

That's correct.

I would yield on

6

that point, that that was where the trial judge was

7

coming from at the time —

8

QUESTION*

9

HR. WESSEL*

10

he did.

Suppose the trial —
—

but it does not appear that

Excuse me, Mr. Justice.
QUESTION*

11

Suppose the trial judge said, I

12

have considered the other Pickering point and reject it,

13

period.

Would that be all right?
MR. WESSEL:

14
15

reason for -- the other reason for the firing, yes.
QUESTION:

16
17

If he said, I've considered them

and rejected them.

18

MR. WESSEL:

19

QUESTION*

20

25

And you wouldn't be arguing that,

MR. WESSEL*

I would not be arguing that

except —
QUESTION*

23
24

Yes, Mr. Justice.

would you 7

21

22

Well, I would think the other

So your argument is, he didn't say

that.
MR. WESSEL*

My arguing, Mr. -- My argument.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Mr. Justice, is that you can't in this sort of situation

2

under Kount Healthy —

3
4
5

QUESTION:
he rejects it?

You mean, he has to say that -- why

Isn't that what you're really saying?

HR. WESSEL;

Correct.

That is part of it, Hr.

6

Justice, but the other thing is that in a dual firing,

7

dual reason firing situation, you can't abstract out of

8

the situation the First Amendment aspect of it, because

9

you then end up, as this Court said in Mount Healthy,

10

where the employee by reason of — by reason of engaging

11

in a First Amendment activity after the real reason

12

becomes — there's a windfall to the employee by

13

grabbing the microphone at the press conference, as was

14

done in Butler versus Hamilton, in the Tenth Circuit,

15

and as was done by the employee in this case, where you

16

go to the press to cover up your own inadequacies or the

17

true reasons for the firing.

18

So, in — you don't have --

19

QUESTION:

20

Hr. Wessel, the disrict judge

didn't — He found the facts differently.

21

MR. WESSEL:

22

QUESTION:

He found —
He found that Connick told the

23

plaintiff she was being fired because of a refusal to

24

accept a transfer, so he was fully aware of that

25

contention, and then he later found the real reason was

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the questionnaire.

2

motive case, but he found it was a single motive case.

3
4

Now, you describe it as a dual

MR. WESSEL;

That's correct, Mr. Justice.

He

found that it was a single motive case, but under the --

5

QUESTION;

You say that is clearly erroneous.

6

MR. WESSEL;

And even under the single motive

7

-- but even under the single motive case, the question

8

has to be addressed as to whether the subject is a

9

matter of public concern.

Now, that has been decided in

10

the various circuits by judicial hunch.

It has been

11

decided in this case by judicial hunch.

There are no

12

guidelines whatsoever to determine what are matters of

13

public concern when an employee, a public employee is

14

fired.
QUESTION;

15
16

That's a separate inquiry, isn't

it, from —

17

MR. WESSELs

18

QUESTION;

19
20

That's correct.
— if you dealt with the motivation

question.
MR. WESSEL;

That is correct, Mr. Justice, and

21

the first and primary point is that the — he reached

22

the balancing or he reached the real reason, but without

23

addressing — the trial court, I am talking about, did

24

not address the public importance of the message or the

25

test that should have been applied insofar as

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

determining whether it was a matter of public concern.

2

It was, in this case, and this is where the results

3

throughout the circuits differ.
In the Lindsey case arising out of Georgia

4
5

where a teacher was fired for faculty, administration

6

criticism in the form of a questionnaire, the Fifth

7

Circuit takes — comes to the conclusion or dictates the

8

conclusion that that is a matter of public concern, but

9

in the Tenth — or the Seventh Circuit, in the Clark

10

versus Holmes situation, you had pretty much the same

11

situation with a teacher, again, determining the course

12

content and the counseling and criticizing it, and the

13

Seventh Circuit says this is not a matter of public

14

concern.

15

So, the threshold question of Pickering is

16

very rarely answered except by some fiat of what is

17

public concern, because there are no standards

18

enuniciated.

19

QUESTIONs

Is the initial question of whether

20

the speech here is constitutionally protected one of a

21

-- that is a mixed question of fact and law, or a purely

22

legal question, or what is it?

23

MR. SESSELs

Justice O'Connor, I believe that

24

it's a legal question, and it's the ultimate question as

25

to whether or not the expression is First Amendment

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

protected or whether it is really a private quarrel

2

between — involving the employee as an employee.

3

test that should be applied and which we are urging the

4

Court in determining the threshold question comes under

5

the Schmidt case and the Clark, v. Holmes case, and that

6

is really -- the Court should determine, does the

7

expression reveal concerns of the individual solely as

8

an employee, or also as an interested citizen?

9

QUESTION*

The

Don't you have to convince us —

10

you have to persuade us that the district judge's

11

findings generally were in — clearly erroneous because

12

of your claim that she was dismissed for refusing to

13

accept a reassignment within the office?

14

HR. WESSEL;

15

QUESTION;

That is — that is -Isn't that the narrow issue?

16

Whether there were other issues or not, isn't that the

17

issue on which you stand or fall?

18

MR. WESSEL:

Not necessarily, Mr. Chief

19

Justice, because not only could the determination or

20

should the determination have been made upon the whole

21

context of the transfer with the questionnaire, but even

22

in the absence of that, if the real reason was the

23

questionnaire, if the real reason was the questionnaire,

24

is the questionnaire and the circulation of the

25

questionnaire a protected activity?

Is it protected

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

under Pickering?

2

matters of public concern?

3

therefore has — there has to be some sort of guideline

4

as to what is a matter of public concern, and that has

5

not been answered by the Court, and that — and that is

6

the question that I am addressing at this point.

7

talking as an employee about matters concerning her

8

employment, or does the questionnaire address issues

9

that a citizen at large would be interested in in

10

Is she voicing concern as a citizen on
And the threshold question

Is she

returning the, say, the district attorney to office?
QUESTION;

11

Do you contend that the district

12

attorney had an absolute unilateral right to assign her

13

to any part of the office he wanted?
MR. WESSEL;

14
15

all about that, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION;

16
17
18

I think there is no question at

Well, isn’t that the heart of this

case?
MR. WESSEL;

That is correct, but the setting,

19

the setting has been ignored in the findings of the

20

trial court.

21

has been ignored, and it centers and focuses on the

22

questionnaire.

23

and focus on the questionnaire, but the setting is

24

important either under determining the content of the

25

questionnaire vis-a-vis what was going on in the office

The setting -- the setting of the transfer

1

at that time, that is, his absolute right to transfer

2

her, and secondly, on the balancing aspect, on his need

3

to have confidence and loyalty in his supervising

4

assistants, for example.

5

On that balancing aspect alone, there is a

6

need to look at the underlying aspects of what was going

7

on, because the integrity of those assistants who

8

partook in the decision to transfer was being questioned

9

by that one question in the questionnaire, and remember,

10

every quesiion in the questionnaire except for the

11

question pertaining to the reaction as to participation

12

in political campaigns, every question pertained to her

13

gripes pertaining to the transfer, and that underlying

14

basis in fact was necessary in order to determine

15

whether the content was in fact matters of public

16

concern, and secondly, whether the balancing required by

17

Pickering, the interest in furnishing the services to

18

the public, was there.

19

He have no — the public — certainly the

20

public is not interested in which assistant district

21

attorney worked in Section A or Section I of the

22

criminal district court.

23

QUESTION*

What do you say — You talk about

24

dual motive.

Supposing the questionnaire could be

25

characterized as sort of a hybrid.

Most of the

questions are just internal office matters, but one or

2

two were matters of public concern.

3

questionnaire be protected or unprotected?
MR. WESSEL:

4

Would the

I think, Mr. Justice, at that

5

point the balance in Pickering should be broadened, but

6

where you had eleven out of thirteen, or eleven or

7

twelve out of thirteen questions that pertained solely

8

to the transfer policy, and one was thrown in as to

9

whether or not the assistants felt that they were

10

pressured into political campaigns.

11

The point is that Ms. Myers —

I am not sure I understand the

answer.

14

MR. WESSEL;

15

QUESTION;

Well —
You are saying the questionnaire is

16

not protected even though one of the questions might

17

have been protected?
MR. WESSEL;

18

I think in the abstract, had the

19

transfer not been involved, then the questionnaire might

20

have been a protected activity, pertaining to one

21

question.

22

thirteen, and it is difficult to answer that.

23

context, I say no.

24
25

But here you have one question out of

QUESTION;

In this

But your argument, I gather, is

that the entire questionnaire was unprotected, even

18

1

though it contained one question which, had it been

2

asked separately, would have been protected.
MR. WESSELs

3

That one question may have been.

4

Actually — Actually, that itself has to do with the

5

operations of the office, whether or not the assistants

6

were asked to participate —

7

QUESTIONi

But would not that — yes, it has

8

to do with operation of the office, but would you not

9

think, it was a matter of public concern if the assistant

10

attorneys were being pressured to work in political

11

campaigns on behalf of their superiors?
MR. WESSEL:

12

I do not believe the voters would

13

turn Mr. Connick out of office or vote him into

14

office --

15

QUESTION

Hell, that is not the question.

t

16

That is not the question.

17

information would be a matter of public concern,

18

whichever way the answer comes out.

19

MR. WESSEL;

20

QUESTIONi

The question is whether that

I don't think so.
You don't think that the public

21

would want to know if the assistants in the office were

22

being pressured to work for political candidates?

23
24
25

MR. HESSEL:

I don't think so, not in the

non-civil service context, and this is where we are.
QUESTION:

Is it your position that in public

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

employment, that a questionnaire sent out to other

2

employees that addressed only the question of the

3

activities that the employees were being asked to engage

4

in that are political in nature would not be

5

constitutionally protected?
MR. WESSEL:

6

No.

That is your position?
I would say that under those

7

sort of circumstances, where that was the sole question,

8

in that respect it would be protected, and it would be QUESTION:

9

MR. WESSEL:

10
11
12

And if there were two questions —
— it would be a matter of public

concern.
QUESTION:

And if there are two questions,

13

that one plus one that is not of public concern, that

14

the situation would change?

15

MR. WESSEL:

Justice O'Connor, it would be

16

difficult to answer that in the abstract, and I would

17

probably have to yield on the point.

18

don’t happen in a vacuum in that regard, but on your

19

question as it is posed, I think I would probably have

20

to yield on the point.

21

QUESTION:

These things just

Mr. Vessel# when you say that

22

something is a matter of public concern, that, I take

23

it, is not the end of your argument on the point,

24

because you say even if it is a matter of public

25

concern, there remains the Pickering balancing test to

HR. WESSEL:

That's correct.

That's correct,

3

so that once the determination is made that the subject

4

matter was one in which the public or the employee has

5

an interest as a citizen to explain to the citizenry or

6

to his fellow employees, given the Givhan case, that the

7

inquiry does not stop at that point, and that the

8

balancing that is required by Pickering is under these

9

circumstances, this time, and this manner, and these

10

circumstances, was this — this expression contained in

11

this questionnaire, is it offset by the perceptions of

12

the district attorney at the time, and whether his

13

perceptions were reasonable in terms of requiring

14

loyalty and confidence in his supervisors and whether or

15

not he was -- it was hindering his concept, if they are

16

based on reasonable grounds of his efficient delivery of

17

the public services, and this circulation was taking

18

place in a courthouse where all the assistant district

19

attorneys were working.

20

It was during the time of their work, for the

21

most part, except one in a luncheon room elsewhere, but

QUESTION;

Are you saying that the

questionnaire was provoked or was a response to the

transfer?
SR. WESSEL*

6

I think that the trial judge

7

definitely found that.

The assistant district attorney

8

definitely testified to that, and she — and that was

sequence of events.
QUESTION;

10

Well, is it your position that

11

there were two reasons for dismissing her, or one?

12

is, was she dismissed because she refused to accept the

13

transfer, or because she circulated the questionnaire?
MR. WESSEL;

14

That

Mr. Chief Justice, the district

15

attorney testified and the assistant testified that when

she was fired, she was told by the district attorney,

transfer, and I resent the implications of Question

Mr. Wessel, was there anything in

24
25

The — Ms. Myers did receive informal notice

The findings of fact made by the district
court are not clearly erroneous.

They are supported,

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

amply supported in the record of this case.

2

of course, facts to which this Court has frequently held

3

that Rule 52(a) applies.

4

they are also insulated from review by this Court's well

5

established two-court rule, because the Fifth Circuit

6

also heard the same argument that Mr. Wessel is making

7

today.

Indeed, it seems to me that

The — Mr. Wessel says that the district court

8

9

They are,

never considered the reasons put forward by Mr. Connick

10

for the — his — the basis for the firing, that is, his

11

reasons that there had been a refusal to accept the

12

transfer.

13

Judge Gordon did consider that, and it is clear in his

14

opinion that he found that Sheila Myers had not refused

15

a transfer.

16

she had refused a transfer.

17

That is simply not true.

The judge did —

He found that Mr. Connick did not believe

Indeed, when Mr. Connick came back to his

18

office after hearing about the questionnaire, he started

19

interviewing various assistant district attorneys who

20

had received the questionnaire, and he wasn't interested

21

in interviewing them as to whether Sheila Myers was

22

refusing to transfer.

23

of the questionnaire.

24
25

He was interested in the content

In fact, he interviewed one district attorney
— his name is Fred Ours, who was from Section I, that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

ir

5

that.

Section I, but Mr. Connick wasn’t interested in
He was interested on the questionnaire.

6

So, the district court’s finding that not only

7

had there not been a refusal to accept the transfer, but

8

also that Mr. Connick didn’t believe there had been a

9

refusal, is also well supported in the record.

It is a

10

finding with regard to motivation which this Court in

11

Pullman Standard versus Swint last term found is a fact

12

tc which Rule 52(a) applies.

13

Since the Petitioner cannot really do anything

14

with those facts, he urges this Court to hold as a

15

matter of law that the content of this questionnaire was

16

so totally devoid of value as to be per se unfit for

17

protection under the First Amendment.

18

he is saying is that the district court erred in even

19

applying Pickering at all, because the questionnaire

20

falls within one of those narrow kinds of speech which

21

this Court has found is outside the scope of the First

22

Amendment to begin with.

23

QUESTIONS

In effect, what

I really don't think that’s a fair

24

characterization of his argument.

He says that it's

25

bisically an internal matter that Pickering doesn't

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

apply to.

I don't think he says it quite the way you

2

describe it.
MR. STRICKLER:

3

Well, Your Honor, Justice

4

Strvens, the reason I’m saying that is because the

5

Petitioner seems to make — base his whole argument on a

6

distinction between matters of "public concern" and

7

milters not of public concern, and I perceive his

8

arpument to be that on a matter where an employee is

9

s?iaking internally, within the office, on a matter not

10

o: public concern, that that is a matter outside of the

11

First Amendment protection, and that Pickering shouldn't

12

ev«n have been applied there.

13

QUESTION:

Insofar as it goes to running an

14

office, that the person in charge of the office has a

15

risht to discharge someone for making disruptive

16

cjnments in the office that don't have any particular

17

public value.

18

think.

19

That's the thrust of his argument, I

MR. STRICKLER:

Well, if that's the thrust of

20

tie argument. Your Honor, I certainly would not disagree

21

that the content of the questionnaire, whether it

22

affects a matter of great public concern or only a very

23

narrow internal matter, is a relevant circumstance to be

24

weighed in the Pickering analysis.

25

in Givhan versus Western Line Consolidated School

This Court has said

30

1

District that where the speech is internal/ not only the

2

content but the manner in which it is male, and the time

3

and place and so forth, all the factors be weighed, and

4

I certainly would concede that the content of the

5

questionnaire must be weighed in the Pickering balance.
The district judge in this case did that.

6

He

7

found that this was a matter that was of public

8

concern.

I think he was clearly right.

Mr. Strickler?

12

MR. STRICKLER:

13

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

What if the questionnaire had

14

contained only Question Number 10?

15

district court would have found — made exactly the same

16

fiacings in connection with what you are now referring

17

to?

18

MR. STRICKLER:

Do you think the

Justice Rehnquist, I would

19

have no way to say what the district judge would have

20

loae in that case, but I think clearly if the

21

questionnaire had only been directed to the confidence

22

in that he -- under these circumstances, he would have

23

fomd it protected, and the reason I say that is because

24

foir of the five persons mentioned in Question 10, these

25

middle level supervisors, as the personnel testified,

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

th»y were all called as witnesses by the defendant, none

2

testified that in any way was their working relationship

3

with Ms. Myers in any way poisoned or interrupted or

4

would be interrupted in the future by this

5

questionnaire.

6

QUESTION;

Did they testify that it wasn’t?

7

MR. STRICKLER:

They didn’t testify that it

8

wasn’t. Your Honor, but I think that’s the — they

9

werer't — they weren’t asked the question to the

10

defeidant, and I think that's the clear implication from

11

theij

testimony, that it would not have been.
QUESTION;

12

Well, if they weren’t asked, I

13

woult

think the implication from their testimony was

14

simply that it wasn't asked.

a negative inference or one way or the other on that.

12

MR. STRICKLER:

Your Honor, in the Pickering

13

case itself where this branch of the law started, the

14

schocl superintendent and all the members of the school

15

boarc testified without contradiction that they thought

16

that letter written by the school teacher, Pickering,

17

was incredibly damaging to the future ability of the

18

schocl board to raise money, to get its bond selection

19

out, and so forth, and this Court said there wasn't a

20

shrec of evidence of that.

said that judges should not rejected as judges what they

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

know as people, and I think there is an element of that

2

in the case.

3

MR. STRICKLER;

Your Honor, to the extent that

4

th* -- I think that certainly the question — Pickering

5

makes relevant the question of whether the — or the

6

issue of whether the questionnaire would have disrupted

7

the harmonious working relationships with intermediate

8

staff and perhaps even with Mr. Connick himself.

9

There was no evidence in this case that that

10

— that there was going to be any such disharmony, and

11

in leed the district court found that there wouldn’t be.
QUESTION;

12

Well, let me call your attention to

13

ona comment of the district court in its opinion on the

14

relief granted, and that’s on Page A-20, where he’s

15

spaaking of injunctive relief.

16

"Considering the acrimonious circumstances surrounding

17

plaintiff's departure from the district attorney's

18

office."
MR. STRICKLER;

19

The opening phrase is,

"And the adverse feeling

20

nectssarily engendered by her resort to judicial

21

reie dies.”
QUESTION;

22

Right.

I take it there were two

23

sou)ces of acrimony, one, her resort to judicial remedy,

24

and two, the circumstances surrounding her departure

I believe. Your Honor, that as

2

you said, you -- no one should ignore what is common

3

sense, and any time that there has been a discharge in

4

any kind of employment there are going to be some

5

acrimonious feelings about that, and when the employee,

6

the rejected employee files suit to enforce his or her

7

rights, there is going to be some ill feeling about

8

tha t.
The judge heard the testimony.

9

He recognized

10

that fact.

11

There is not a hint in this record that Judge Gordon

12

felt that he was compelled to grant reinstatement, but

13

he listened to all the evidence, and he found that even

14

tic ugh there might be some ill feelings arising out of

15

tads litigation and the circumstances surrounding it,

16

t.i?t reinstatement was appropriate anyway.

17

He was exercising his equitable discretion.

He didn’t — But at the same time, he was

18

elfarly — he clearly weighed the Pickering balance, or

19

20

and found that with regard to the content of the

21

questionnaire, it would not create such a disharmony in

22

the district attorney's office that it would make Ms.

Myers’ ability to continue functioning there impossible

24

or inefficient.

25

MR. STRICKLER;

1

-- was a meeting with the

2

first assistant, Mr. Waldren, at which, according to

3

both Mr. Waldren's testimony and Ms. Myers’, the

4

discussion started off about the transfers, but kind of

5

went on into -- and broadened in scope, about various

6

things that Ms. Myers had to say about the efficient

7

working of the DA's office.

8

again this is what the court found, Mr. Waldren

9

suggested that Ms. Myers was speaking only on her own,

Mr. Waldern suggested, and

10

and that other people did not share her views.

Ms.

11

Myers said, no, that's — I think I do — I am speaking

12

for other people, and my view is not unique, and she

13

said she would do some research on it, and what she did

14

then was prepare the questionnaire.
And I take issue with what Mr. Wessel said.

15
16

Mr. Wessel said the questionnaire is a — it is just a

17

kind of a — putting the questions, these internal and

18

petty gripes about her own transfer.

assignment
HR. STRICKLER;

It was never our contention

3

that Ms. Myers was entitled to reinstatement to a

4

particular section.

5

QUESTION;

Ho, sir.
Now, do you find any internal

6

inconsistency in the court’s finding in which he said,

7

the defendant, the district attorney, neither acted with

8

malice nor reckless or wanton disregard for plaintiff’s

9

civil rights?

10
11

Do you find any inconsistency between

that finding and the other findings that he made?
HR. STRICKLERs

No, sir.

That finding is with

12

regard to our claim for punitive damage, and I believe

13

that a finding that a person has not acted recklessly or

14

with malice for purposes of punitive damages does not

15

mean the person hasn’t acted knowing the consequences or

16

knowing what his actions will entail.

17

And certainly the district judge found that,

18

as a finding of facts, that Hr. Connick had acted

19

because of the questionnaire and would not have acted

20

but for the questionnaire.

21

anything inconsistent in saying that, in saying that he

22

acted without malice.

23

QUESTION;

I don’t believe there’s

Is that entirely consistent with

24

the fact that she was notified of her transfer before

25

the questionnaire was circulated?

MR. STRICKLER:

1

She was notified of her

2

transfer, Your Honor, but the questionnaire was not a

3

part and parcel of any refusal to accept the transfer.
QUESTION:

4
5

But she did refuse to accept the

transfer, didn’t she?
MR. STRICKLER:

6

She did not. Your Honor.

7

There is a finding -- the court found that she did not

8

accept — refuse to accept the transfer.

9

she talked to Mr. Waldren and Mr. Connick, she said, I

In fact, when

10

will consider it.

Now, there were two witnesses who

11

testified, contrary to Ms. Myers’ testimony, that she

12

had flatly refused to accept the transfer.

13

judge heard their testimony and didn’t believe them.

14

There was ample reason not to believe them.
QUESTION:

15

The district

If a superior tells a subordinate,

16

gives a subordinate an order, and the subordinate says,

17

I will think about it, I will consider it, what do you

18

call that?

19

MR. STRICKLER:

I don't call it an absolute,

20

flat refusal to accept an order.

Indeed, the district

21

judge found on the morning that Ms. Myers was fired she

22

had a conversation with Mr. Connick, she told him that

23

she would consider it, consider accepting the transfer,

24

and at that point Mr. Connick thought that was a

25

satisfactory answer.

He didn’t — He certainly didn't

2

whatever.

3

district judge.

4

That was a finding of fact made by the

I think that this — the context in which this

5

has to be reviewed, Your Honor, is the fact that Hr.

6

Connick also testified that complaints about transfers,

7

internal complaints to him about transfers were very

8

common, and that while he didn't think they were

9

negotiable, at the same time he didn’t — indeed, put

10

very little weight on the fact that DA’s frequently

11

complained about going one place or the other.

12

In fact, he testified that on occasion he had

13

allowed Ms. Myers on an earlier occasion to talk him out

14

of being transferred.

15

thought it was acceptable that she said she was going to

16

consider it is certainly not only supported in the

17

record but it is understandable.

18

So, the finding that Hr. Connick

I think the important point, though, is the

19

district court found that Mr. Connick did not fire Ms.

20

Myers or discharge her because he believed she was

21

refusing the transfer.

22

didn't believe there was a refusal.

23

found that he fired her because of the questionnaire,

24

and that leads us back again to whether the

25

questionnaire itself falls within protected speech.

There was no refusal, and he

district judge, after finding that the Pickering

MR. STRICKLER;

3

I believe they're all matters

4

of public concern.

I believe they're all matters of

5

public concern because they all relate to the efficient

6

operation and the morale of an important governmental

7

agency.

8

as the bond issue speech that was addressed by this

9

Court in Pickering, and they're more important, it seems

They're at least as important, it seems to me,

10

by any standard, than the dress code communication that

11

was at issue in Mount Healthy.
Mount Healthy involved a communication

regarding the content of an internal dress code in a

14

public school.

16

this questionnaire are matters of public concern.

MR. STRICKLER:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.

It was on a Cincinnati radio

21

station.

Doesn't that add a little different dimension

22

to the case than when it's purely internal?
MR. STRICKLER:

23

Only in the respect that it

24

implicates another factor in the Pickering balance, Your

25

Honor.

It certainly seems to me that some kind of

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

communications are more disruptive if they're made in

2

the public forum.
For example, if Ms. Myers had indeed broadcast

And I think a court must take that into

So to the extent that it went to the public at

large, I think it is a factor to be weighed in the

11

Pickering balance, but I do not think that it is a —

12

that this Court has ever, and I certainly do not think

13

in Pickering this Court intended, to draw any kind of

14

bright line between matters of public concern and

would make any difference.

3

HR. STRICKLER;

It shouldn't make any

5

as to the potential disruptive effect.

6

there's any doubt about that.

7

QUESTION;

It does make a difference, though,
I don't think

Mr. Strickler, was there any

8

discussion or had there been any discussion in the city

9

with respect to the morale of the district attorney's

10

office, any public discussion?
MR. STRICKLER;

11
12

The record does not reflect

that. Your Honor.
QUESTION;

13

Is it your suggestion, in light of

comments you made earlier in your argument, that this

15

sort of morale is really — this sort of questionnaire

16

is really beneficial to office morale?

of a government bureaucracy.

that all of this individual's supervisors were people

MR. STRICKLER;

The question is, do you have

I don't believe that's a personal

3

QUESTION;

You don't?

4

MR. STRICKLER;

No, sir.

But even if the

5

Court were to consider it that, it seems to me that this

6

Court has frequently said that public employees have

7

rights to communicate or to assemble and to organize

8

with regard to their work in the public sector.

9

being able to communicate ideas like, do you think your

Without

10

supervisor is doing a good job or do you trust their

11

word, that right, that First Amendment right to

12

organize, is meaningless.
QUESTION;

13

Talking about public and private,

14

do you know of any private organization that allows you

15

to circulate questionnaires while you're working?
MR. STRICKLER;

16

I know of some private

17

organizations that do, Your Honor, but private

18

organizations are not bound by the Fourteenth

19

Amendment.

20

QUESTION:

21

they don't allow it, do they?

That's what I'm saying.
