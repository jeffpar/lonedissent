ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL A. REZNECK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

9

MR. REZNECK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, these two cases are here on a single

11

issue, whether the federal courts in the District of

12

Columbia have jurisdiction to review prior decisions of

13

the D.C. Court of Appeals denying applications to the

14

D.C. bar or the D.C. bar examination by particular

15

applicants.

16

Rather than burdening the Court with a recital

17

of the facts of these cases, which are fully set out in

18

the brief, I thought it would be useful if I outlined at

19

the outset the routes by which an applicant may obtain

20

admission to the D.C.

21

There are three possible routes.

22

bar as they bear on these cases.

One is graduation from an ABA-approved law

23

school and success on the D.C. bar examination, and

24

there is no dispute here that neither of these

25

applicants met that standard.

That particular —

QUESTIONi

2

Neither of them?

Did they ever get

to the second one?
SR. REZNECK:

3

Neither took the bar

4

examination, and neither was a graduate of an

5

ABA-approved law school.
QUESTION:

6

So they were, as I understood, the

7

problem is that they were barred from taking the

8

examination.

That is the issue, isn't it?

MR. REZNECK:

9

On the circumstances presented

10

to the D.C. Court of Appeals, each one was not permitted

11

to take the D.C. bar examination.

12

Honor.

13

That is correct, Your

Now, that requirement of graduation from an

14

ABA-approved law school prevails in most jurisdictions

15

in the United States.

16

undermined by any court, to my knowledge, and when an

17

effort was made to challenge it here several years ago,

18

this Court held that the challenge did not present a

19

substantial federal question.

20

Its validity has never been

The second route for admission to the D.C. bar

21

is admission on motion of a person who is a member of a

22

court of general jurisdiction of any other state or

23

territory, and who has been engaged in the practice of

24

law for five of the eight years preceding the

25

application.

This is Subsection (c) of the Court's Rule

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

46 that we have been dealing with.
I would point out to the Court that teaching

2

3

at an ABA-approved law school qualifies under this rule

4

as being engaged in the practice of law, and Mr.

5

Feldman, as his brief indicates, has been doing that for

6

some period of time at Rutgers Camden, which is an

7

ABA-approved law school.

8

can be admitted on motion to the D.C. bar after the

9

specified time period.

In other words, Mr. Feldman

He is not forever barred from

10

the D.C. bar by the fact that he did not graduate from

11

an ABA-approved law school.
The third route is that a person who is a

12

13

graduate of an unaccredited law school is eligible to

14

take the D.C. bar examination upon completion of 24

15

credit hours in an ABA-approved school.

16

so-called 24-hour rule, which is involved in Mr.

17

Hickey's case.

18

in the District of Columbia.

19

Hickey's home state of Maryland.

20

United States as a whole, and 24 credit hours at any one

21

of them is sufficient to satisfy the Court's 24-hour

22

rule, and Mr. Hickey is still entirely eligible to do

23

that.

24
25

This is the

There are six ABA-accredited law schools
There are two in Mr.
There are 172 in the

Thus, there are several different routes into
the D.C. bar.

The one route which we submit is not

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

available is for a frustrated bar applicant to go to the

2

United States District Court and obtain a coercive order

3

against the D.C. Court of Appeals, nullifying a prior

4

decision of that Court, and requiring it to abandon its

5

own rules for admission, and that is what both the

6

Respondents have attempted to do here.

7

I would like to identify for the Court several

8

important interests which we regard as being at stake in

9

this case.

First, and I suppose most obvious, is the

10

interest of the D.C. Court of Appeals in maintaining its

11

independence and its authority in a matter which has

12

been expressly confided to it by Congress, admission to

13

its bar, and the governing statute here, I think, is

14

about as explicit as it could be.

15

of Title XI of the D.C. Codes

16

This is Section 2501

"The District of Columbia Court of Appeals

17

shall make such rules as it deems proper respecting the

18

examination, qualification, and admission of persons to

19

membership in its bar."

20

And I want to emphasize that we are not

21

talking here about admission to the bar of the U.S.

22

District Court for the District of Columbia or the U.S.

23

Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which are

24

entirely free to regulate their own bars as they see

25

fit, and they do so.

QUESTION;

Mr. Rezneck, do you think your case

2

stands on any different footing than if you were

3

representing the highest court of a state?

4

MS. REZNECK:

5

Reorganization Act,

6

QUESTION;

7
8

Yes, I do, because of the Court

Justice Pehnguist.
In what respect does it stand on a

different footing?
MR. REZNECK;

I think that considering the

9

history of regulation of the bar in the District, which

10

was originally confided to the U.S. District Court as a

11

court of general jurisdiction, you had a considered

12

judgment by Congress expressed in that statute

13

transferring that jurisdiction to the District of

14

Columbia Court of Appeals as the highest court of the

15

District of Columbia.

16

I think it is a question of what implications

17

can fairly be drawn from that transfer of jurisdiction.

18

I would point out that there is precedent in this Court

19

under the Court Reorganization Act, specifically the

20

Swain versus Pressley decision by Justice Stevens on

21

behalf of the Court several years ago, which construed a

22

different provision of the Court Reorganization Act as

23

conferring less jurisdiction on the federal district

24

court here than would be true on federal district courts

25

elsewhere in the country because of the provisions and

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the intent of Congress in the Court Peorganization Act.

2

So, I io think that we stand on a different

3

and on a stronger footing here in the District for an

4

absence of jurisdiction in the federal courts.
QUESTIONs

5

Well, suppose before Alaska was

6

admitted to the Union it had the same kind of a

7

problem.

8

courts, territorial judges performing certain

9

functions.

Once it was admitted — that is, the federal

Once it was admitted to the Union, it comes

10

in on an equal footing with all other states, and also

11

with equal burdens, does it not?

12

SR. REZNECKi

Then it is a state.

It would

13

depend, of course, as to whether the Act of Congress had

14

anything to say about control over admission to the

15

bar.

16

is admitted.

17

explicitly with the subject of control of admission to

18

the bar, and of course there isn't any Congressional

19

statute applicable anywhere else in the United States

20

except in the District of Columbia.

Normally that would not be the case when a state
Here we do have a statute which deals

So that we have that statute to interpret and

21
22

apply here, particularly in the light of the prior

23

history in the District of Columbia of regulation of the

24

bar .

25

As I was indicating, the D.C. Court of Appeals

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is not in any sense attempting to control the bars of

2

other courts in the District of Columbia.

3

for example, is a member of the bar of the U.S. Court of

4

Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.

5

briefs in cases in that court, and in the reports of

6

decisions in cases in that court.

7

Washington, he was eligible to practice in the Federal

8

District Court here, because he was associated with a

9

member of the bar of the Federal District Court.

Mr. Feldman,

His name appears on

While he was in

10

In other words, we are concerned solely here

11

with admission to the local bar, and that is the right

12

to practice in the local court system and to hold

13

oneself out as admitted to the general practice of law

14

in the District of Columbia, and we submit that the

15

decision below overturns or undermines one of the

16

pillars of the Court Reorganization Act of 1970,

17

was the transfer of jurisdiction over the local bar from

18

the federal court to the U.S. -- to the D.C. Court of

19

Appeals.

which

20

And I would suggest that a few lines of the

21

history here are instructive, because as I think this

22

Court knows from its prior decisions under the Court

23

Reorganization Act, and as I certainly well remember

24

when I came to Washington to practice 20 years ago, we

25

had

this unique hybrid court system here, where you had

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a federal court system that was a court of general

2

jurisdiction, not limited jurisdiction, you had a local

3

court system that was entirely subordinated to the

4

federal court system, and you had a local bar which was

5

under the control of the U.S. District Court.

6

QUESTION:

Well, in those days, Hr. Rezneck,

7

there was a Municipal Court which is somewhat like the

8

Superior Court now.

9

Is that correct?

MR. REZNECK:

10

QUESTION:

11

HR. REZNECK:

12

The Superior Court is a court of

general jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

14

MR. REZNECK:

16

No, it was — well —

Somewhat.

13

15

Somewhat.

Yes.
The Municipal Court was

certainly not.
QUESTION:

It performed functions somewhat

17

like, but broader.

18

situation on practicing before the Municipal Court?

19
20
21

22
23

Now, in those days, what was the

MR. REZNECK:
the Municipal Court bar.
QUESTION:

There was separate admission to
If one was a member of the —

Did you have to take an

examination ?
HR. REZNECK:

No.

If one was a member of the

24

bar of the U.S. District Court, one was admitted to the

25

bar of the Municipal Court, and I believe also of the

10

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

D.C. Court of Appeals, as it then was, so that you had

2

really a mirror image situation of what prevails now.

3

QUESTION:

And then when the Municipal Court

4

later became the Court of General Sessions,

5

same practice prevail?

6

MR. REZNECK:

7
8

did the

The same situation prevailed,

because that was prior to Court Reorganization.
QUESTION:

And then it went from the Court of

9

General Sessions to —

10

MR. REZNECK:

The Superior Court, and it was

11

then that the Superior Court became a court of general

12

jurisdiction.

13

highest court —

14
15
16

The D.C. Court of Appeals became the

QUESTION:

Like any other — Like any other

state court.
MR. REZNECK:

Correct.

The D.C. Court of

17

Appeals became the highest court of the District of

18

Columbia, and both federal courts in the District of

19

Columbia were reduced to the status of courts of limited

20

jurisdiction, like other lower federal courts in the

21

United States.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Rezneck, are there any areas at

23

all in which judgments of the D.C. Court of Appeals are

24

reviewable other than in this Court?

25

MR. REZNECK:

I think that there may be one

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

provision in the Court Reorganization Act that deals

2

with certain types of criminal cases where you have a

3

joinder of D.C. Code and U.S. Code offsnses in the local

4

court system.

5

still exist for review of such cases by the U.S. Court

6

of Appeals, although that may be part of the phase-out.

7

There was some transitional reviewing jurisdiction even

8

after the Court Reorganization that existed for some

9

years, but --

I think there is some provision which may

QUESTION;

10

11

of the D.C.

12

this Court?

But after that phase-out, judgments

Court of Appeals would be reviewable only by

KR. REZNECK;

13

Only by this Court.

That's

14

correct.

And that was a key provision of the Court

15

Reorganization Act, that decisions of the D.C. Court of

16

Appeals were made directly reviewable here instead of in

17

the lower federal courts as they had been previously,

18

and the independence and control over the D.C. bar which

19

was confided by Congress to the D.C. Court, of Appeals

20

had been scrupulously respected by the federal courts in

21

the District of Columbia prior to the decision in the

22

present case.

23

in the Federal District Court which had dismissed suits

24

by frustrated bar applicants as not being the business

25

of the Federal District Court in Washington.

There has been an unbroken line of cases

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

2

Did those cases raise

Constitutional questions?

3

MR. REZNECK;

4

QUESTION;

Some did.

But is — Is your view that the

5

case turns on the fact that there was an application for

6

the right to take the bar exam, or would it be the same

7

case if they had never applied,

8

on the rule collaterally?
MR. REZNECK;

9
10

and just made an attack

If they had gone into the

District Court originally, in the first instance?
QUESTION;

11

Yes.

Say it was a little clearer

12

case of a Constitutional claim of substance.

13

an old Illinois case, I know, that denied admission to

14

women, and supposing you had that kind of a rule.

15

a woman have to apply for admission before she could

16

bring a collateral attack on the rule?
MR. REZNECK;

17
18

Mould

Well, you don't, of course, have

to reach that question here, because of the case —
QUESTION;

19
20

T-here was

3ut I am trying to understand your

theory.

21

MR. REZNECK;

22

QUESTION;

Right.

I mean, is it your view that the

23

jurisdiction is so exclusive that every attack on the

24

rule must be made by seeking admission to the bar?

25

MR. REZNECK;

If we were pressed to take a

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

position on that because the facts required it, I think

2

our position would be that the will of Congress is that

3

exclusive jurisdiction over bar admission should be —

4

QUESTION;

5

HR. REZNECK;

6
7

Would you limit that -— in the D.C. Court of

Appeals.
QUESTION;

Would you limit that contention to

8

the D.C. Court of Appeals?

9

generally to state courts?

10
11

12
13
14

HR. REZNECK:

You wouldn't apply it

No, because there is no Act of

Congress that would govern in such situations.
QUESTION;

And you probably don't think it

would be valid as applied to state courts.
HR. REZNECK;

Well, I haven't had to face that

15

question, and of course it is not necessary to face the

16

question that you put in these cases, because —

17

QUESTION;

Well, the reason it may be is that

18

at least as to one of the applicants, it is not at all

19

clear that he applied for anything other than

20

discretionary relief from the rule as opposed to a

21

holding that the rule was invalid.

22

HR. REZNECK;

23

QUESTION:

I think —

And if he just asked for

24

discretionary relief, it might be just like a case where

25

he had done nothing.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. REZNECKi

I think that there are three

2

I have thought about this, and I think that there are

3

three possible approaches that could be taken, and there

4

are authorities, I think, that support each of them.

5

They all lead to the same result here.

6

I think one could conclude that on the basis

7

of the Court Reorganization Act, that exclusive

8

jurisdiction from start to finish is confided to the

9

D.C. Court of Appeals subject to review by this Court.

10

There is an intermediate position, which is that where

11

applicants have gone to the D.C. Court of Appeals or,

12

for that matter, to a state court in the states, and

13

have obtained an adverse decision from the state court

14

or in this case the D.C. Court of Appeals, that they

15

cannot then go into the Federal District Court to seek

16

review or to relitigate any issues that were before the

17

local court.

18

And I think there is a third position, which I

19

know finds support in a decision by Judge Marrage and in

20

the Fourth Circuit decision in the Woodard case that we

21

have cited in our brief, which is that bar admissions

22

matters are of such paramount importance to the states

23

that whether it is the District of Columbia or the

24

states, they belong in the state court system from start

25

to finish, subject — and I always emphasize subject —

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to final review in this Court.

2

So, under any of those views, of course, these

3

cases would be decided exactly the same way, in favor of

4

dismissal here.

5

QUESTION;

Under the third view, you wouldn't

6

draw a distinction between a license for a doctor, say,

7

and a license for a lawyer?

8

9

MS. REZNECK;

Not under that third view.

is probably the broadest approach.

That

It certainly isn’t

10

necessary to the decision of this case, but there is

11

very respectable authority in the Fourth Circuit, and I

12

think also in the Ninth Circuit, taking that — taking

13

that point of view.

14

QUESTION;

And what do you say about the,

15

again, on the waiver, that this is just a -- I know your

16

rule, but please waive it?

17

here, in one case, at least.

18

MR. REZNECK:

That is all that happened

Well, I don't think that is

19

really an accurate summation of what happened here,

20

because I know that the Respondents here have attempted

21

to avoid the effect of the Summers case —

22

QUESTION;

Yes.

23

MR. REZNECK;

— by asserting that all that

24

they were doing was asking for a waiver. and that they

25

were not in any sense making a so-called claim of right

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which would create a justiciable controversy and lead to

2

a judicial determination.
I would point out that if you read their

3
4

petition carefully, that you will see that each

5

Respondent was asserting in his petition to the D.C.

6

Court of Appeals that he was qualified to practice law

7

in the District of Columbia, that ha was qualified for

8

admission to the D.C. bar, or at least to take the D.C.

9

bar examination, by reason of the unique circumstances

10

of his particular case.
In fact, they necessarily had to assert, and

11

12

they did in fact assert that they were qualified to

13

practice in the District of Columbia because that was a

14

predicate for them to be eligible for a waiver.

15

other words,

16

court was capable of taking judicial action.

In

there was a claim of right on which the

I would like in that connection just to refer

QUESTION:

Oh, in the Joint Appendix.

2

MR. REZNECK:

Right, 20a.

That is the Hickey

3

petition.

"Petitioner is substantively qualified to sit

4

for the bar examination.”

5

request for a waiver, that he met the qualifications,

6

other than in the one respect of not having graduated

7

from an ABA law school.

That was a predicate to his

8

His counsel, and I emphasize that both these

9

litigants were represented by distinguished law firms,

10

and it seems to me unrealistic to say that what has

11

happened here was somehow a trap for the unwary, which

12

is the phrase that they have used.

13

Hickey’s petition, his counsel stated, after reviewing

14

the unique circumstances of his case, "Far more than

15

most, this man has earned the right to sit for the bar

16

examination."

QU ESTION:

17
18

At Page 24 of Mr.

Yes, I know, but he starts his

petition by saying he seeks a waiver.

19

MR . REZNECK;

20

QU ESTION:

Yes —

-- and the last line is, for the

21

foregoing co mpelling reasons, rule so and so should be

22

waived.

23

So it is a request for a waiver.

MR . REZNECK:

He does, but I don’t think that

24

the terminol ogy — I don’t think that the terminology of

25

a request fo r a waiver can be determinative of the

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

question whether the D.C. Court of Appeals made a

2

judicial determination in his case.

3

don’t think, this is simply a pleading matter.

4

have been numerous cases in the circuits in which people

5

asked for exceptions, for exemptions.
QUESTION*

6

In other words, I

Do you think there was appellate

7

jurisdiction in this Court to review that

determination?

after the denial.

Could we have reviewed that?
Are you speaking of the Hickey

case specifically?

But on this petition, they entered

20

an order denying it and saying we refuse to waive the

rule.

22

SR. REZNECK*

23

QUESTION*

24
25

Right.

Is it your view that that was an

appealable order in this Court?
MR. REZNECK*

Well, I think that the question

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of this Court's jurisdiction over that kind of decision

2

is, I think, unsettled in the sense that there is no

3

doubt that this Court would have Constitutional --

4

Article III jurisdiction to review it, because it is a

5

matter which arises in the District of Columbia, where

6

all law is federal, and I think that you will find in

Right.

And I am asking you, did he have
Could he have direct review here?

MR. REZNECKs

I think that he could if there

16

federal Constitutional questions, assuming that that —

18

QUESTIONS

Well, we've got the petition in

front of us.

19

MR. REZNECKs

20

QUESTION;

21
22

Right.

As you read the petition, did we

have jurisdiction to review the order denying?
MR. REZNECKs

I think there is a question on

23

the petition as written as to whether there would be

24

statutory jurisdiction under 1257.

25

QUESTIONS

So your answer is no.

of arising in the District of Columbia.

I really do not know the answer to

I think, if I may try to be responsive to your

7

point, because I understand what you are seeking here,

8

that he could have raised, whether he did so explicitly

9

or not, he could have raised in the D.C. Court of

10

Appeals, either in that petition or on a petition for

11

reconsideration following the denial of his waiver, any

12

and all federal Constitutional questions which he later

13

asserted in his suit in the District Court, and I would

14

suggest that what you have here is a situation of a

15

bypass of available remedies.

characterize it.

17

another way to characterize it.

That is one way to

understand your — Your position is, his only remedy is

20

by filing in the D.C. Court of Appeals and then direct

21

review here, and at his first opportunity he must raise

22

all the questions he wants to raise, and then we could

23

review them, and he is —

MR. REZNECK;

and he is done now.

All he did was ask for a waiver,

MR. REZNECK:

5

Ke could have --

He could have gone — He could

6

have gone back and raised any and all federal

7

Constitutional or statutory questions by way of petition

8

for reconsideration after the action of the Court of

9

Appeals in this case.

I don't think that would be

10

imposing an unreasonable burden on him if the

11

alternative is to inject the federal court system and to

review

13
14

QUESTION:

But there would be no — was there

a timeliness requirement on that?

15

MR. REZNECK:

No.

This is an adjudication that really

doesn't bar him from just starting all over again

23

MR. REZNECK;

That is — That is correct.

In

fact, we have taken the position in the District Court
QUESTION:

A rather strange case of

adj udication.
MR. REZNECK:

We took the position in the

24

District Court, Your Honor, that if Mr. Hickey wants to

25

renew this process and apply for a waiver and raise any

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and all of those questions now, he is free to do that in

2

the D.C. Court of Appeals now and the court will hear

3

him .
QUESTION;

4

Mr. Rezneck, it seems to me I have

5

seen perhaps in some New York proceedings, if someone is

6

dissatisfied with what might be classified as an

7

administrative action of the New York Court of Appeals,

8

they apparently have a right to bring an action in the

9

Supreme Court of New York, which is obviously subsidiary

10

to the Court of Appeals.

11

possibility of initiating -- of either of these

12

Respondents initiating action in the Superior Court of

13

the District of Columbia?
MR. REZNECK;

14

Mould there have been any

I think one — I suppose one

15

could presuppose or postulate that you could -- you

16

could have formulated an action perhaps against the

17

admissions committee in the Superior Court.

18

under the statutory framework here, where jurisdiction

19

over the bar is so clearly confided to the D.C. Court of

20

Appeals, that from a procedural standpoint, these

21

petitioners proceeded correctly, which was to file a

22

petition in the D.C. Court of Appeals as an original

23

matter.

24
25

QUESTION;

I think

And it is that statute that

confides the jurisdiction or the responsibility for

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

admission to the bar to the District of Columbia Court

2

of Appeals that you rely on to say that the -- that

3

Court of Appeals is in a different position here than

4

the highest court of the state?

5

MR. REZHECK;

Hell, I rely on it as making a

6

Congressional allocation of jurisdiction between local

7

and federal courts which has no counterpart in any

8

federal statute applying elsewhere in the United States.

9

QUESTION:

Well, if you were representing the

10

state of Hew Jersey in the same set of facts, would you

11

be making different arguments, except that you think you

12

have an additional argument?

13

MR. REZNECKs

I would — That is correct.

I

14

would be arguing for the same result, because there is a

15

long line of cases in the Circuit and District Courts

16

holding that a bar applicant who goes to the state court

17

system first cannot thereafter seek, in effect,

18

collateral review of the state court decision by going

19

to the federal courts.

20

which is summarized by the Tenth Circuit in a case

21

called Doe versus Pringle.

22

argument if this case arose in New Jersey.

23

QUESTION:

That is a line of authority

We would certainly make that

Is that the case in which there is

24

some suggestion that there is the risk that the federal

25

courts would become superboards of law examiners?

One

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of the cases has that.

2

MR. REZNECK;

Well, there is a lot of language

3

in these cases, and I may say, if I might speak to that

4

point, that -- because I think it does give some

5

additional strength here to the idea that it is entirely

6

rational to construe the Congressional purpose here as

7

conferring this jurisdiction exclusively on the court,

8

on the D.C. Court of Appeals, that we are dealing here

9

with judges who, although Article I judges, admittedly,

10

are nevertheless nominated by the President, are

11

confirmed by the Senate of the United States, are used

12

to dealing with questions of federal Constitutional and

13

statutory law as their daily staple.

14

This is a court which has shown itself over

15

the years since it was made the highest court of the

16

District to be fully receptive and congenial to claims

17

of federal Constitutional law.

18

courts, I suppose, in addition to the federal court

19

system, is a court whicfr can properly be entrusted with

20

the determination of federal Constitutional or other

21

questions, subject to ultimate review by this Court.

22

In other words —

23

QUESTIONi

This, almost above all

Well, Kr. Rezneck, what if I went

24

before the -- or what if my wife, assuming she were

25

admitted to the bar, went before the Court of Appeals

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

for the Ninth Circuit and applied for admission to that

2

court, saying that she was admitted tc practice in the

3

state of Arizona, the district of Arizona, and the Ninth

4

Circuit says, no, we don't admit women to practice

5

here?

6

ruling?

Is there any review that she could have of that

MR. REZNECKs

7

decision of the Ninth Circuit?
QUESTIONS

9

Well, I would think she would

have a petition for certiorari in this Court.
QUESTION;

12
13

Yes.

MR. REZNECKs

10
11

If the — If that was the

And that that would be a case in

the Court of Appeals within our jurisdiction?
MR. REZNECKs

14

Yes, that would, it seems to me,

15

be a clear Constitutional violation by the Ninth

16

Circuit.

17

QUESTION;

Well, I assume it would be, and I

18

assume that Respondents here are claiming that there was

19

a clear Constitutional violation, and your answer isn’t

20

that there wasn't a violation, but that whatever the

21

case with respect to that may be, there is no remedy.

22

MR. REZNECKs

No, I think that — the case

23

that you put is really an -- is in the sense that you

24

have the judicial determination by the Ninth Circuit

25

acting in a judicial capacity which would be reviewable

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in this Court on writ of certiorari, just as here it is

2

our position that you had a judicial determination by

3

the D.C. Court of Appeals acting in a judicial capacity

4

which was reviewable by this Court, but not in a lower

5

Federal District Court.
So, I don't see any conflict or divergence

6
7

between the two cases.
QUESTION!

8
9
10

Constitutional issues weren't raised, we normally
wouldn't review those issues.
HE. REZNECKs

11

12

Well, we wouldn't — if the

You are speaking on review of

the D.C. Court of Appeals decision.

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

MR. REZNECKi

Well, again, I think that really

15

goes to a question which has not ever been settled in

16

the District of Columbia, because as Justice Marshall's

17

opinion which I referred to in Pernall -QUESTION;

18

I know he could have raised them,

19

and I know your position is that whether he raised them

20

or not, the federal court has no role in this matter at

21

all.

22

MR. REZNECK;

23

QUESTION;

That is correct.

But until he does raise these

24

issues, at least some federal issue, some federal -- is

25

the decision reviewable here, other than — just other

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

than the refusal to waive?
MR. REZNECKs

It may be reviewable as a

3

decision on federal law, all of which decisions are

4

ultimately reviewable here.

5

6

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but it wouldn't

include Constitutional issues.

7

SR. REZNECKs

QUESTIONt

9
10

Yes, it —

If he didn't raise them.

If he

didn't raise them.
MR. REZNECKi

If in fact he didn't raise them,

11

that would pose a question, but he pleaded the facts

12

which would support the very Constitutional claim that

13

he articulated as a Constitutional claim when he got to

14

the District Court.

15

QUESTION;

We normally require something more

16

than a record that -- on the basis of which a

17

Constitutional issue could have been raised.

18

MR. KEZNECK:

I think ray point would be that

19

with respect to the question here, which is the

20

allocation of jurisdiction between the D.C. Court of

21

Appeals and the Federal District Court, that if he could

22

have raised those questions --

SR. REZNECK;

9

We don't have to reach that

10

point, but if forced to it, that would also be our

11

position.

12

QUESTION;

Well, the same rule.

13

MR. REZNECK;

But I emphasize that he is

14

entirely free to seek to raise those questions now if he

15

chooses to do so, assuming he did not do so before, and

16

of course I am only referring to Mr. Hickey in this

17

regard.

reading of the record that Mr. Feldman raised those

federal constitutional questions in the D.C. Court of

20

Appeals.

21

There is no question, I think, on a fair

What if he has to raise factual

How would it work in that case?
MR. REZNECK:

7

I think that -- I think that the

8

state court system, at least in the first instance,

9

subject to review by this Court, would provide the

10

factfinding mechanism by which such a question would be

11

adjudicated.

12

demonstrate that that mechanism was inadequate, just as

13

in other contexts, and didn’t provide a fair and

14

adequate remedy in the state court system, that would

15

provide a basis for going to the federal courts.

16

think that is true in habeas corpus, and it is true in a

17

number of other contexts.
QUESTION:

Now, I think it is clear that if you could

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT FELDMAN

MR. SUSSMAN*

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

5

may it please the Court, I would like to begin by going

6

back to the initiation of proceedings in the District of

7

Columbia court system, and to sketch for this Court some

8

of the facts that Mr. Rezneck omitted to present.

9

I would like to begin, if I can, by mentioning

10

Mr. Feldman's qualifications and legal training.

11

Feldman elected to educate himself as a lawyer not by

12

going to law school, but by reading law, that is,

13

pursuing a program of legal study in a law office, which

14

is a recognized method of training for the bar in the

15

state of Virginia and in a number of other jurisdictions

16

around the country.

Constitutional principles, and there is no necessary

We have not

presented our position on the merits of the case.

11

issue that we have addressed both in the District Court

12

and in the Court of Appeals is the jurisdictional issue,

13

and I think that that is the issue which is now before

14

the Court.

15

The

I do want to point out that Mr. Feldman was

16

admitted in Virginia, and subsequently in Maryland,

17

after passing the bar exams of both states, and he

18

decided to become associated with a law office here in

19

the District of Columbia, and as a result, and quite

20

naturally, he sought admission to the District of

21

Columbia bar.

22

Upon filing his admission papers with the

23

committee on admissions, he was informed that the rule,

24

Rule 46 of the Court of Appeals barred Mr. Feldman at

25

the threshold from being considered for admission to the

attended such a school.
Hr. Feldman nevertheless felt that his

qualifications were good, that he had had a thorough

legal education.

7

of the profession, and he hoped that he could find some

8

way to persuade the bar admission authorities in the

9

District of Columbia to consider his qualifications on

their merits.
The committee on admissions advised Mr.

11

12

Feldman that the only way he could be considered for

13

admission to the bar was if there were a waiver of the

14

requirement of graduation from an ABA-accredited law

15

school.

16

one body and one body only in the District of Columbia

17

that could grant such a waiver, and that was the D.C.

Mr. Feldman’s next step was to submit a

20

petition directly to the Court of Appeals asking the

court to waive the requirement of ABA — graduation from

qualifications, and I would like to stress what issues

were raised by that petition and what issues were not,

MR. SUS5MAN:

1

Well, that’s right.

I think we

2

would be happier to be in the District Court litigating

3

the merits of Mr. Feldman’s Constitutional claims, and I

4

don't think, to address a point that Mr. Rezneck raised,

5

that we could have sought review in this Court from the

6

denial of the waiver of petition, because the only issue

7

that was raised by the waiver petition, and clearly the

8

only issue which was addressed in the order of the Court

9

of Appeals was whether the rule requiring graduation

10

from an ABA-accredited school should be waived.
QUESTIONi

11

Would you think that the rule,

12

whatever the rule is, should be the same for a

13

jurisdiction which would not permit a person to sit for

14

examinations to be -- to practice medicine unless they

15

had graduated from a school, a medical school accredited

16

by the American Medical Association or some other such

17

body?

18

MR. SUSSMANi

Well, I think that on the

19

merits, there are certain Constitutional principles

20

which should be applied to all accreditation schemes,

21

whether they are schemes involving the practice of

22

medicine, the practice of law, or the practice of any

23

other profession, and I think that it would be anomalous

24

if the federal courts, lower federal courts were free to

25

entertain Constitutional claims involving the legality

of a state's accreditation scheme for medicine tut not

2

to entertain exactly the same claims when they arise in

be the consequence of the very broad rule which Mr.

MR. SUSSMAN:

I think the Constitutional claim

that we asserted in the -- in the District Court and in

17

right to a waiver, but that Rule 46, both on its face

25

that is the very point that we are making.

that the decisions of this Court have recognized that

attention to something.
MR. SUSSMANs

Well, the cases that we have

12

cited in our -- in our brief are 1983 cases, but I would

13

say beyond that that the exhaustion requirement as I

14

have always understood it is a requirement in most cases

15

to exhaust administrative remedies.

16

there is a reasonable prospect of obtaining

administrative relief from the relevant decision-makers

wouldn’t think that would apply where the administrator

Well, Your Honor, if I can

strong countervailing policy considerations, a litigant

is entitled to litigate Constitutional issues in the

federal court.

18

19

exhaustion requirement, be it in the administrative

20

context or in the judicial context, is to give a chance

21

for the administrator to address those issues which are

22

peculiarly within the competence of that administrator,

23

perhaps in the hope that a controversy in the

24

Constitutional sense will be avoided.

25

The choice of forum is with the

Now, here, we went to the D.C. Court of

2

within the province of the D.C. Court of Appeals to

3

grant us.

quite frankly, we felt that if there was any prospect of

5

attaining admission to the bar administratively and

6

informally, much better to do that than to proceed

7

directly in federal court and --

10

We wanted a waiver from the rule because,

QUESTION*

No one likes to sue to be admitted

to the bar.
MR. SUSSMAN*

Well, that’s right.

That was

11

not an appealing prospect, and we wanted to make very

12

sure that we had exhausted all possibility of obtaining

13

admission within the confines of the D.C. administrative

14

process for bar admission before going to federal court

15

and raising our Constitutional claim.

16

QUESTION*

Well, there is some suggestion, at

17

least, that Feldman raised his Constitutional issue with

18

the D.C. Court of Appeals.

19

NR. SUSSMAN*

Your Honor, I think that we

20

advised the D.C. Court of Appeals that we were

21

contemplating raising Constitutional issues.

22

identified what those issues were, but, and this is

23

quite important, we did not submit them for decision.

perfectly consistent with the character of our

Well, we now have a problem, I

neither of the federal courts ruled on that issue, did

they?
MR. SUSSMAN:

16

That's right, neither of the

courts ruled on that issue, but I don't think that that

18

is an issue which one has to decide if the Court

19

concludes that the petition was merely administrative in

character.

If the petition —

21

Well, if the Court were to conclude

that your filing was judicial in character initially,

then presumably we would be faced with what to do with

the splitting of the cause of action or the res judicata

Would we then have to remand on that, or

And should that be remanded, in

your view?
MR. SUSSMAN:

10

No, I think that you can decide

11

the res judicata issue without considering whether there

12

was an impermissible splitting of the cause of action.

13

We have contended in our brief that if there was a cause

14

of action asserted by the waiver petition, it was a very

15

different cause of action from that which was advanced

16

in the complaint in the District Court.

17

it is a fundamental principle of res judicata that if

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL F. HEALY, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT HICKEY

7

MR. HEALY

i

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, we requested the opportunity to

9

present a brief argument this afternoon on behalf of Mr.

10

Hickey because of certain important distinctions between

11

Mr. Hickey's case and that of Mr. Feldman.

12

Again, since Mr. Rezneck did not take the

13

opportunity to highlight any of the facts, let me take a

14

few moments to do that.

15

After a distinguished, a long and

16

distinguished career in the United States Navy, Mr.

17

Hickey decided to retire from the Navy, having attained

18

the rank of Commander, and to enter into a new

19

profession, the practice of law.

20

enrolled the Potomac School of Law, a newly established

21

law school here in the District of Columbia.

22

Mr. Hickey was a member of its first class.

23

In March of 1975, he

In fact,

Potomac was not accredited by the American Bar

24

Association.

Indeed, because of its newness, it had not

process.

However, the D.C. Court of Appeals had

2

followed a practice for some time of granting waivers

3

from its requirement that applicants for the bar

4

examination be graduates of an accredited law school.
In the spring of 1978, Mr. Hickey applied for

5
6

such a waiver.

The petition submitted on Mr. Hickey's

7

behalf emphasized certain aspects of his

8

qualifications.

9

service to the country.

It also emphasized his many years of

1

Mr. Sussman has addressed that, and I don't think that

2

they were, but in Mr. Hickey's case, there was no

3

presentation of any legal arguments.

4

Petitioner's contention that he is nonetheless

5

barred from Federal District Court is very intriguing in

6

that light, since the fundamental basis of their

7

decision that the action of the D.C. Court of Appeals in

8

Mr. Feldman's case was a judicial act is the

9

presentation of this letter.

10

11

No letter was submitted in

Mr. Hickey's case.
Having said that, I think we have to look back

at certain fundamental principles of federal court

15

contention is respectfully without merit.

16

one looks at the cases of Key v. Doyle or Swain v.

17

18

Senate report and the House of Representatives report in

19

intention of the statute was to make the D.C. Court of

21

22

various states.

23

I think if

With respect to the comity claim that he also

24

makes, I don’t think there is really any difference, but

25

in fact the D.C. Court of Appeals is still a creature of

MR. HEALY:

20

Your Honor, you might have a

22

District Court counsel for petitioners argued that

23

because we had not made a formal application after

24

having bean daniad tha waiver, that we didn't have

13

MR. HEALY:

14

QUESTION:

15

Yas, Your Honor.
Now, where is that case?

The

citation of that case?

16

MR. HEALY;

17

QUESTION;

In the state court situation?
That the highest court of the state

18

rules against you, and that gives you a right of action

19

in the district court of that state.
MR. HEALY:

20

The Ktsanes court, the Seventh

21

Circuit decision -- it is K-t-s-a-n-e-s — said that an

22

application for a waiver from the court's rules does not

23

become a judicial act within the meaning of Summers, and

24

that one has the right subsequently to go to federal

25

court.

QUESTION;

1

I didn't say waiver or anything.

2

My question was, if the highest court of the state rules

3

against you on anything, where do you get the right to

4

appeal that to a United States District Court?

5

my question.
MR. HEALY:

6

Yes, sir.

That is

If the highest court of

7

a state rules, having been presented with claims against

8

one, one must take a petition for certiorari to this

9

Court.

10

QUESTION;

How do you apply that to this case?

11

MR. HEALY;

In this case, we did not submit

12

any federal questions — we did not submit any state law

13

questions to the D.C. Court of Appeals.

14

QUESTION:

Did I say state or federal

15

questions in my hypothetical?

16

MR. HEALY:

I didn't say either.

If one submits purely a state law

17

question, one could still go to federal court.

18

simply asked for a waiver, we would submit that that is

19

not a ruling by the state court and in judicial

20

capacity.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. HEALY:

23

If one

What is it?
It is merely an administrative act

denying a request for a waiver.

24

Finally --

ORAL ARGUMENT CF DANIEL A. REZNECK, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

6

MR. REZNECK*

Let me just respond very briefly

7

to a couple of points.

8

asserted that he did not raise federal Constitutional

9

questions in the D.C. Court of Appeals.

Mr. Feldman's counsel has

I think the

10

record clearly is contrary to that.

11

letter to the D.C. Court of Appeals, which is at Pages 6

12

to 15 of the Joint Appendix, one will see --

13

QUESTION*

Six?

14

MR. REZNECK*

If one examines his

Pages 6 --

Six to 15.

One will see such

15

questions, for example, this Court must give him some

16

opportunity to show that his unique training and

17

experience have provided him with adequate

18

qualifications to practice law.

19

Feldman's application without according him that

20

opportunity would represent the very kind of

21

irrebuttable presumption that the Supreme Court and the

22

United States Court of Appeals have expressly

23

condemned.

24
25

A flat rejection of Mr.

The District Court found explicitly that he
did more than seek a Rule 46 waiver.

He in fact raised

Constitutional ani statutory issues before the D.C.

Court of Appeals.
QUESTION*

3

As I understood Hr. Sussman, he

4

said that he stated their Constitutional positions but

5

he didn’t really tender them.
HR. REZNECKs

6

I don’t know what that means,

7

Your Honor.

If you look at his own complaint, which I

8

think may be the best evidence on this, his own

9

complaint in the District Court, Page 41, and he is

10

describing the proceedings in the D.C. Court of Appeals,

11

and he says, "Finally, counsel argued that on its face

12

and as applied. Rule 46 violated both the United States

13

Constitution and the federal antitrust laws insofar as

14

it conclusively denied admission to the bar to all

15

persons except graduates of an ABA-accredited law

16

school.”

17

I think the record is clear here that he did

18

raise those questions, that he certainly could have

19

taken them to this Court on certiorari from the decision

20

of the D.C. Court of Appeals.

He did not do so.

With respect to Mr. Hickey in that regard,
while Kr. Hickey did not articulate his claims in the

1

same way, I think a fair reading of his petition will

2

show that Mr. Hickey claimed before the D.C. Court of

3

Appeals that he was qualified to take the D.C. bar

4

exam.

5

Appeals, said that he could see no difference in

6

Constitutional principle between a claim of right of

7

admission to the bar and a claim of right to take the

8

bar exam, and that each tendered an issue before the

D.C. Court of Appeals which was reviewable here, and was

I just wanted to comment in conclusion on the

12

point raised by Justice O'Connor.

13

find that the decision of the D.C. Court of Appeals in

14

each of these cases was a judicial determination, which

15

we submit it was, what the result should be.

16

that the result should be a reversal of the decision of

17

the U.S. Court of Appeals and a reinstatement of the

18

judgments of dismissal of the District Court.

19

If this Court should

That is so for two reasons.

We submit

It would be an

20

effort to relitigate in the District Court a judicial

21

determination by the highest court of the state, and

22

there is clearly no subject matter jurisdiction in the

23

federal court to do that under a long line of cases, and

24

alternatively, it would be res judicata either on the

25

theory that the same facts and theories in essence were

55

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

pleaded in both courts, or alternatively, that all

2

theories could have been pleaded in the D.C. Court of

3

Appeals and were not and are still barred by the

4

doctrine of res judicata.

5

So, either way you go on that question, once

6

you conclude it is a judicial determination, I submit

7

that the result here should be a dismissal of both

8

cases, which is what both district court judges found

9

should be done.

Thank you.
