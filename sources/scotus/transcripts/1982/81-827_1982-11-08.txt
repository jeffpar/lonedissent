CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

2

We will hear arguments

3

next in Jefferson County Pharmaceutical against Abbott.

4

Hr. Tucker, I think you may proceed whenever you're

ready.

6

ORAL ARGUHENT OF JOE L. TUCKER, JR., ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9
10

MR. TUCKER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case involves the issue of whether or not

11

the prohibitions of the Robinson-Patman Act apply to

12

sales of drugs to governmental agencies where those

13

governmental agencies act in direct competition with

14

private enterprise.

15

County, Alabama and the Board of Trustees of the

16

University of Alabama exempt per se from the application

17

of the Robinson-Patman Act, even though they compete

18

with privately-owned enterprises; in particular in this

19

case, retail pharmacists.

20

QUESTION;

That is, are agencies of Jefferson

I suppose on the status of this

21

case, which was decided basically on the basis of the

22

complaint, we have no idea what percentage of the

23

pharmaceutical products were sold to indigent sick or

24

what part to the public in general.

25

MR. TUCKER;

Justice O'Connor, we do not have

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

any firm statistics with that regard, although a

2

thorough investigation was made prior to filing the

3

complaint, and that investigation did reveal plenty of

4

facts sufficient to substantiate the complaint, with the

5

exception, of course, the ruling of the district court.
QUESTION;

6

Would you agree that many states or

7

local governments in states do and have traditionally

8

undertaken to provide medical care and services to the

9

indigent sick?
MR. TUCKER:

10

I would agree, Justice O’Connor,

11

that many states have undertaken to provide care to the

12

indigent sick.

13

of health care services is a traditional government

14

function.

15

However, I will not agree that providing

I would also not agree —
QUESTION:

You would concede that it is in

16

some states, I suppose; those who since statehood have

17

assumed that responsibility?

18

MR. TUCKER:

I agree that some states have

19

assumed part of that responsibility, but I could not

20

agree that it was a traditional governmental function of

21

states or counties to provide —

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Even in states which have done it

since statehood?
MR. TUCKER:

Well, Your Honor, I state this

based on not only — with regard to indigent services,

that may be true,

2

going not just to services for the indigent, but to the

3

general public as a whole; paying persons as well as

4

those on Medicaid, and drugs being purchased by Medicaid.

But in our case, the allegations were

This case began in 1978 when Jefferson County

5

6

PHarmaceutical Association filed suit in the United

7

States District Court of the Northern District of

8

Alabama seeking injunctive relief and treble damages

9

against 15 drug manufacturers, and Jefferson County and

10

the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama

11

Medical School.
The two hospitals, Jefferson County's

12

13

charitable institution. Cooper Green Hospital, and the

14

University of Alabama Hospita were operating pharmacies

15

in direct competition with private retail pharmacists.

16

I think it's important to note where the pharamacy was

17

with regard to the one operated by the University of

18

Alabama.

19

The University of Alabama Medical Center has a

20

hospital and that hospital has a pharmacy approximately

21

on the 15th and 16th floors.

22

one selling drugs to the general public, but a separate

23

pharmacy located away from the hospital, at street

24

level, nice, comfortable chairs in the lobby for people

25

to come in and wait on their prescriptions to be filled

That pharmacy was not the

5

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

off the street, the general public, to be served.
A11 of the defendants filed motions to dismiss

2
3

claiming that the sales to governmental agencies were

4

exempt from the application of the Robinson-Patman Act.

5

The district court ruled in favor of the defendants and

6

held that sales to the county and state agencies*

7

pharamacies were beyond the reach of the Robinson-Patman

8

Price Discrimination Act without regard to 15 USC 13c,

9

which is the Non-Profit Exemption Act.
Petitioner appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court

10
11

of Appeals, now the Eleventh Circuit, and that court

12

affirmed the district court without opinion.

13

noting the decision of the district court.

14

Judge Clark wrote a dissenting opinion stating that the

15

court had created a near-exemption to the Act.

16

stated that this exemption allowed governmental agencies

17

to compete in the private, proprietary sector of

18

commerce, and use its superior buying power against

19

businessmen operating private retail drug stores.

Just
However,

He

First of all, purchases for resale -- that’s

20
21

the key here in this case.

This case is very similar,

22

of course, to Abbott laboratories versus Portland Retail

23

Druggists Association, where this Court held that the

24

Robinson-Patman Act applied to sales to private

25

hospitals.

That case, of course, did not reach the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

that case, as I understand it, there

1

issue here where

2

were not — it was not before this Court the issue of

3

governmental agencies selling to general public.

4

The antitrust laws do apply to

5

anti-competitive conduct of state and local governments

6

when engaged in proprietary functions.

7

cited in the City of Lafayette versus Louisiana Power

8

where this Court held that the word "persons" as used in

9

the antitrust laws, includes states and their political

10

This has been

subdivisions.
QUESTION

11

Mr. Tucker, if you prevail here,

12

will there be any spill-over effect on military

13

exchanges?

14
15

MR. TUCKER:
would apply.

No, sir, I don't think that that

The case —

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. TUCKER:

Why?
The case of Champaign-Urbana News

18

I believe spoke to that issue, a similar issue, except

19

that in that case, Champaign-Urbana News sought to apply

20

the Robinson-Patman Act to the Secretary of the Army and

21

Secretary of the Air Force.

22

held that it could be not applied; that the Secretary of

23

Army and the Secretary of the Air Force were immune.

24
25

QUESTION:

And of course, this Court

Did you, by any chance, have lunch

in the Court cafeteria this noon?

MR. TUCKER:

5

QUESTION:

MR. TUCKER;

8

QUESTION:

10

Yes, sir.
If you prevail here, do you think

there would be a spill-over effect on the cafeteria here?

7

9

You know we have one here in the

building?

4

8

No, sir, I didn’t.

No, sir.

I don’t.

The --

Would you distinguish it on the

grounds that that’s maintained chiefly for the
convenience of personnel working in the building?
MR. TUCKER:

11

Yes, sir.

I think that the

12

cafeteria here would be very similar to the situation

13

possibly in General Shale versus Struck Construction

14

Company.

QUESTION;

17

MR. TUCKER:

18

QUESTION:

19

But it is open to the general

Yes, sir.
Did the Chief Justice say was

maintained chiefly or cheaply?

20

(Laughter.)

21

QUESTION:

Well, my next question was going to

22

be what if, then, the evidence showed that 75 percent of

23

the customers were tourists and other people not

24

connected with this building, and only 25 percent were

25

people in the building?

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. TUCKER:

If that were the case. Your

2

Honor, and they were in direct competition, of course,

3

the difference here is federal versus state and local.

4

I think — my understanding of the case is there’s no

5

question but that the Congress has the power to regulate

6

through the commerce powers, activities of the state and

7

local governments.

8
9

Whether or not —

QUESTION:

Well, in the Chief Justice's

example, there's still the possibility that the

10

Robinson-Pat man Act might not apply where there are

11

sales to a government entity which then itself engages

12

in activity that is competitive with private business.

13

But that it would cover just sales for resale by

14

government.

15

MR. TUCKER:

Yes, sir.

I think there is some

16

distinction in what is happening there in that there,

17

the hospital pharmacies are buying the drugs for the

18

purpose of intent of reselling —

19
20

QUESTION:

They aren't just buying for the

purpose of running a hospital.

21

MR. TUCKER:

22

QUESTION:

No, sir.
Which -- the hospital would be

23

competitive, perhaps, but they nevertheless aren't --

24

here they're reselling.

25

MR. TUCKER:

The hospital may be competitive

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

with other hospitals, and I think that from Justice

2

O'Connor's comment there has been some recognition that

3

some hospital activities, although it's not, according

4

to the case of Swain versus Milford City Hospital, Inc.,

5

it*s not a traditional governmental function.

6

activities have been sanctioned to some extent.

Those

7

But here you have something that is completely

8

outside the traditional function of government, and that

9

is the operation of retail pharmacies.
QUESTION;

10

Would you concede that to the

11

extent that the state operated its public hospital and

12

its pharmacy within that hospital only for the benefit

13

of the indigent sick that the state undertook to care

14

for, that even under your test, the Robinson-Patman Act

15

would not apply?
MR. TUCKER;

16

Your Honor, I think that would

17

depend entirely on the facts of the case.

18

would depend on whether there was a resale in

19

competition, or whether or not, for instance, they were

20

giving away the drugs.
QUESTION;

21

I think it

I think —

Or sold very cheaply to people who

22

gualified as indigents who couldn't afford otherwise to

23

buy them .

24
25

MR. TUCKER;

Well, I would have to say, Your

Honor, that if drugs were sold and they were sold in

10

ALDERSON REPORTINQ COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

competition with private enterprise and they were

2

obtained through discriminatory price bidding, then they

3

would have to fall within the proscriptions of the

4

Robinson-Patman Act.
QUESTION:

5

There are —
Wouldn't that have the effect of

6

discouraging states and local governments from providing

7

certain forms of assistance to the indigent sick?
MR. TUCKERi

8
9

so.

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

In Alabama this has not been a function of state

10

government.

In fact, it's not even authorized by the

11

state code.

The code — nowhere have I been able to

12

find in the Code of Alabama, 1975 edition, anything that

13

authorizes any state agency, including hospitals, to

14

sell drugs to the general public.

15

that has occurred and evolved through the development of

16

the University of Alabama in Birmingham which covers a

17

60-square block area of downtown Birmingham.

This is something

I would like to point to the legislative

18
19

history.

20

exemption should not be carved out.

21

be just limited to the exemption stated.

22

an exemption for private, non-profit hospitals.

23

exemption, the Non-Profit Institution Act, in fact, does

24

cover governmental agencies.

25

It appears, from the cases, that certainly, an
An exemption should
And there is
That

But the legislative history supports our

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

position that purchases by state and county agencies are

2

covered by the Act when those agencies use those goods

3

in competition with private retail pharmacies, rather

4

than consuming them for their own use.

5

I’d point to Mr. Teegarden's testimony in the

6

petitioner’s brief on the merits, pages 9 and 10, page

7

12, pages 15 and 16.

8

that the state or federal government, whichever, is

9

saved by its function.

There, Mr. Teegarden explained

That is, it was never envisioned

10

that the state or the federal government would be in

11

competition with private enterprise.

12

take on this anti-competitive nature and compete with

13

private enterprise.

14

That they would

He stated that the reason they were not

15

subject to the Robinson-Patman Act, in his testimony,

16

was because they were not in competition.

17

say that if a city hospital competed with a

18

privately-owned hospital that it would be subjected to

19

the proscriptions of the Robinson-Patman Act.

20

certainly, the legislative history of Mr. Teegarden when

21

he was testifying before the Senate or House committee,

22

covered this area.

23

that if they enter into competition, then they are going

24

to be required to adhere to the proscriptions of the Act.

25

QUESTIONS

He went on to

So

He covered this problem and stated

Your case only reaches situations

where the resale is available to the public generally, I

2

take it.

3

MR. TUCKERs

4

QUESTION;

That's correct.
So you don't think it would reach

5

post exchanges, which are just restricted to the

6

military.

7

MR. TUCKERs

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. TUCKERs

That's correct.
Or whoever they're restricted to.
That's correct.

So long as it is

10

restricted to that agency's own use, whether it was its

11

dependents -- I mean, employees or dependents of the

12

employees —
QUESTION;

13

Nell, what if the University of

14

Alabama said we’ll only let students patronize the drug

15

store?

16
17

MR. TUCKERs

patronize the drug store?

18

QUESTIONS

19

MR. TUCKERs

20
21

They would only let students

Yes.
I don't think the students would

be covered.
QUESTION;

Well, the students aren't covered,

22

but are the drug stores covered?

You say it would not

23

apply if the federal government, or the government

24

agency restricted the resale to people within — for

25

whom it had some responsibility.

13

MR. TUCKERS

QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.
sir
So I take it you've just excluded

3

the University of Alabama drug store if they say nobody

but students can buy here.
QUESTION*

10

Or faculty, yes.

So you would

exclude them?
MR. TUCKER*

7
8

Students or faculty.

Faculty and staff members could

p urchase.
QUESTION*

Yes.

And the Robinson-Patman Act

wouldn't reach that situation.

11

MR. TUCKER:

That's right.

12

QUESTION*

And how about students?

13

QUESTION*

In my understanding of students, it

14

would not apply, according to my reading of Abbott

15

Laboratories versus Portlant Retail Druggists.

16

QUESTION*

So then, the only competition

17

you're talking about is the extent to which the

18

university drug store sells to members of the general

19

public who are not either students or faculty.

20

MR. TUCKER*

21

QUESTION*

22
23

That's correct.
What about families of the faculty

or families of the students?
MR. TUCKER*

They could purchase, also.

QUESTION;

If that's the case, it's construing

2

an exemption from the Act.

here, do ve?

4

SR. TUCKERs

We don't have an exemption

No, sir.

There is no exemption

5

other than the Non-Profit Institutions Act.

6

exemption spoken to in the entire Act.

7

QUESTION:

There is no

Well, this is a very different

8

theory from Sr. Teegarden's theory that you quote I

9

think three times in your briefs.

His theory was

10

there's an absence of injury to competition.

11

relying — you say that isn't the test at alls the test

12

is 13c, which is a very different theory.

13
14
15
16
17

KR. TUCKER:

Now you're

Well, Your Honor, I would say

that Hr. Teegarden's theory is what I'm saying —
QUESTION:

You see, his theory came before

there was any 13c.
HR. TUCKER:

Right.

There would be an

18

exemption; even though the Act applies there would be an

19

exemption to take it out from under the proscriptions of

20

the Act if it meets the test of Abbott Laboratories,

21

which considered 13c.

22

QUESTION:

What is the legal basis for your

23

saying this?

Just that it makes good sense?

Because

24

you certainly can't base that on what Teegarden said;

25

you can't base it on 13c.

It may make a lot of sense,

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

2

but is there any legal foundation?
MR. TUCKER:

Yes, sir.

As stated.

The

3

Portlant Retail Druggist in my reading of it is the same

4

as what we have here except that we have governmental

5

institutions competing with private enterprise as

6

opposed to private persons.

7

If I may comment with regard to the Non-Profit

8

Institutions Act, that Act exempts purchases for

9

consumption by both non-profit and charitable

10

governmental institutions.

My question would be why

11

would Congress, two years after the Robinson-Patman Act,

12

enact the Non-Profit Institutions Act if there was a per

13

se exemption already?

14

Non-Profit Institutions Act was enacted to create this

15

exemption for non-profit charitable institutions and

16

governmental institutions.

It is only logical that the

17

And I would point to —

18

QUESTION;

Is it possible that it was enacted

19

only to aid the charitable institutions?

20

where the problem was?

21

MR. TUCKER:

Wasn't that

Well, if I may point to the

22

legislative history of that, Justice O'Connor,

23

Representative Walter's testimony — and that's found on

24

pages 8 and 9 of our Reply Brief, and on pages 11 and 12

25

of the Amicus Brief of the National Association of Petal

Druggists.

2

specifically stated that the Non-Profit Institutions Act

3

applied both to charitable instutions and to

4

governmental agencies such as governmental hospitals.

5

Representative Walter's testimony there

Further, the case of Logan Lanes versus

6

Brunswick held that the sales of bowling equipment to

7

the Utah State University were exempt because that

8

bowling equipment and those bowling lanes were being

9

used for the university's own use, and it went into

10

detail to discuss how it was used in the PD program in

11

the teaching of classes, used by faculty members, used

12

in physical education by the students, et cetera.

13

Further, in the City of Lafayette case, as

14

found at 425 US, at page 397, footnote 14, this Court

15

exempted — stated in that footnote that libraries were

16

exempt because they made purchases for their own use.

17

Further, I would point to the motions to dismiss by nine

18

of the defendants in this case.

19

in the Joint Appendix Pages 19A to 48A.

20

defendants in this case concede that the Non-Profit

21

Institutions Act applies to governmental purchasers.

22

Those motions are found
Nine of the

Now, I would suggest that if the Non-Profit

23

Institutions Act applies to governmental purchases then,

24

of course, the Robinson-Patman Act would have to apply

25

to those purchases.

of California and Georgia --

3

QUESTION:

Let me interrupt a minute.

They

4

filed a motion to dismiss and one of the grounds of the

5

motion was that the sales allegedly made are lawful

6

under 13c.

7

Is that a concession, you think, that —
HR. TUCKER:

I think so. Your Honor.

Nine of

the defendants — and in fact, one of those defendants

9

is Cooper Green Hospital.

Cooper Green Hospital, in my

MR. KLINGSBERG*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
This case presents the question of whether

20

sales to state and local government agencies are within

21

the coverage of the Robinson-Patman Act.

22

suggest that the petitioner has drawn the issue too

23

narrowly, and that in interpreting congressional intent

24

as to whether the Robinson-Patman Act covered state and

25

local government agency purchases and looking at the

language of the Act, it can’t simply be limited to

2

drugs, it can’t simply be limited to hospitals and it

3

can't simply be limited to the state of Alabama.

4

But rather, it deals with the entire spectrum

5

of government agencies, a great many of which purchase

6

commodities and purchase commodities which are covered

7

by the Robinson-Patman Act if indeed the Act was

8

applicable, whether they're sold for use or for

9

consumption or resale under the terms of the Act.

10

herefore, a very far-reaching assertion is being made

11

here by the petitioner.
Our position, based on legislative history,

12
13

judicial decisions and the unanimous view of the

14

commentators, including Representative Patman, is that

15

Congress did not intend to apply the Robinson-Patman Act

16

to purchases by state and governmental agencies.
I would like, if I may, to concentrate on two

17
18

main points; one, the statutory scheme as reflected in

19

the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 and the Non-Profit

20

Institutions Act of 1938, which we say is logical and

21

consistent only if the earlier statute, the original

22

Robinson-Patman Act, is read as the legislative history

23

indicates; not to reach purchases of governmental

24

agencies.

25

And this conclusion is buttressed by

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

Congress's rejection in 1951 and 1953 of specific

2

proposed amendments which were not enacted to extend the

3

statute’s reach to purchases by states and their

4

political subdivisions.

5

to act despite more than 40 years of uniform enforcement

agency recognition —
QUESTION;

Do you have any instances in that

8

legislative history of where the committee reports or

9

individual congressmen or senators addressed expressly

10

the sales for resale matter?

11

MR. KLINGSBERG;

12

QUESTION;

I know —

There was discussion —

I've read your briefs, but I didn't

13

notice you ever picked out a particular instance like

14

that.
MR. KLINGSBERG;

15

Right.

There was discussion

16

in the oral hearings with Mr. Teegarden, who is counsel

17

to the wholesalers and one of the draftsman —
QUESTION;

18
19

That may have been in a hearing,

but nothing on the floor or in any committee reports.
MR. KLINGSBERG;

20

Well, in the committee — in

21

a written brief which Mr. Teegarden submitted, he was

22

asked the question;

23

bidding on government purchases below trade price

24

levels.

25

that as a matter of statutory construction he would

would the bill prevent competitive

And he answered that question first by saying

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
«0 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

think that it would not be covered, and he assured

2

Congress that it wouldn’t be covered.

3

a further reason was the effect on competition because

4

of the requirements relating to secondary line

5

competition.

6

And then he said

I should point out, Your Honor, that the

7

Robinson-Patman Act as ultimately passed also has a

8

primary line provision in which there would be liability

9

where there is a sale to a state, for example, if indeed

10

the states were covered, and there is no effect on

11

competition by the state or the city or the municipality

12

with some drug store or retailer, but there was an

13

effect on competition at the primary line level between

14

the sellers.

15

And so on that basis, it would seem that the

16

resale or the competition are not, by the state, would

17

not, under the terms of the statute, have anything to do

18

with whether the Act applies or not.

19

Teegarden’s written report indicates the categorical

20

elimination of applicability and assurance to the

21

congressmen who were concerned as to whether or not the

22

states and municipalities could continue their practice

23

of competitive bidding and buy, in the words of

24

Congressman Hancock who asked one of the questions, at

25

the cheapest prices.

And Mr.

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

Congress was concerned that the states and

1
2

cities be able to purchase at the cheapest prices and

3

continue the practice, which they have today, of buying

4

at prices as the question asked in the written report

5

says, below trade price levels.

6

How, —

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Klingsberg, with respect to the

8

instances in 1951 and 1953 where you say that Congress

9

rejected efforts to amend the Act, were there bills that

10

actually were — hearings were held on in committee?

11

Did they get out of committee?
MR. KLINGSBERG:

12

Not in the 1951 and 53, but

13

in 1968 and 69, there were extensive hearings before a

14

subcommittee of Congress on small business which dealt

15

with this very problem.

16

raised.

17

counsel to National Association of Retail Druggists who

18

is one of the principal amici here, told the congressman

19

on that occasion that there were three categories.

20

The whole controversy was

And as a matter of fact, Mr. Kintner, who is

One category was government, and that was not

21

covered by the Robinson-Patman Act.

The second category

22

was charitable eleemosynary institutions, and that

23

category was covered by the Robinson-Patman Act but

24

given a partial exemption under the Non-Profit

25

Institution Act.

The Non-Profit Institution Act did not

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

apply to government
And the congressional subcommittee adopted

2
3

that, quoted it in its report and — to find the

4

Non-Profit Institution Act as only applying to private

5

charitable institutions, and concluded after extensive

6

hearings at which it was brought out that there's

7

competition between drug stores and hospital pharmacies

8

and so forth, there was testimony by pharmaceutical

9

manufacturers that went on for weeks — concluded that

10

what should be done is the administrative agencies

11

should enforce the Robinson-Patman Act as against the

12

non-profit, non-governmental private charitable

13

hospitals where they don't meet the requirements of the

14

1938 Act.

15

But never concluded and was never even asked

16

by the National Association of Retail Druggists to

17

extend the basic Robinson-Patman Act to cover

18

governmental purchases.

19

QUESTION:

So Congress —

What was the purpose of that

20

committee report?

21

with respect to a particular piece of legislation?

22

Was it to say do not pass or do pass

MR. KLINGSBERG:

I think the purpose was to

23

consider the problem which was set before it at great

24

length and to make recommendations which was a

25

recommendation to the administrative agencies that they

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

should enforce the Act as against the private,

2

charitable hospitals.
Now, inherent in what I’ve been saying, if

3
4

Your Honors please, is that to appreciate the logic of

5

the statutory scheme, you have to look both at the 1936

6

Act and the 1938 amendment.

7

8

because they were not covered by the Robinson-Patman Act

say is wrong, libraries can, I was very interested to

find out, be privately run, privately endowed, open to

Schools can be private.

And there are thousands of

Now, if governmental purchases were intended
to be covered by the 1938 exemption, a logical

legislature surely would have included other types of

governmental buyers.

exemptions for libraries, schools and hospitals and

13

apply the Robinson-Patman Act without any exemption,

14

without any own-use exception to police, fire,

15

sanitation, transit, parks, the cafeteria downstairs,

16

museums, prisons and so on.

Why would you have just three

An irrational statutory scheme would result if

18

the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 were interpreted to

reach purchases of all governmental entities and the 38

Act were interpreted just to exempt partially three

21

governmental entities.

that Congress believed, as the legislative history

supports, that government purchases were not covered by

QUESTION;

2

Mr. Klingsberg, isn't it possible

3

that in 1938, Congress didn't particularly consider the

4

primary line competition problem because your principal

5

focus was on the secondary line I think, in the

6

Teegarden testimony at least, and that the assumption

7

that it didn't apply was simply based on the assumption

8

that you wouldn't have competitive injury in the normal

9

case where there are sales to the government.
MR. KLINGSBERG;

15

this case demonstrates.

where there wouldn't be any realistic likelihood of

agencies?

eleemosynary institutions.

institutions are private, charitable institutions.

considered the matter.

And therefore, it would be very unreasonable

and unfair and illogical to have the basic

there is no expression of intent one way or the other,

11

that that would apply to cities, for example, in the

12

Lafayette and Boulder case, but here we have a whole

applied in terms of analyzing the purpose, context,

comment on it?

I don't know if it's totally relevant or

22

not, but among the amicus briefs, I don't find a brief

23

from the Solicitor General, and they have expressed

24

their views on the Robinson-Patman Act in several cases

25

recently, and generally have not been sympathetic to the

2

the outcome of this case.

HR. KLINGSBERG;

How do you explain that?
I don't know if this is

4

proper argument, but I spoke to them — I spoke to the

5

proper person in the Justice Department, and they said,

this is a question of pure statutory intent.

QUESTION;

Not interested in the law?

11

QUESTION;

If it was Mr. Patman who said it,

12

the statement that was mentioned that this was for

13

government purchases, is it not implicit in that kind of

14

a statement, fairly implicit government purchases for

15

its own use?

16

MR. KLINGSBERGs

Your Honor, Representative

17

Patman stated in his book that the Attorney General of

18

the United States has ruled that the Act does not apply

1

to government, meaning federal government, and it may be

20

presumed that his reasoning may also be applied to

21

municipal and public institutions, so Representative

22

Patman said in 1938 that he, the sponsor of this bill,

23

the man whose name appears, did not think that it

24

applied at all to governmental purchases.

25

QUESTION;

That is somewhat post-legislative

MR. KLINGSBERGi

2

But it's the same time, Your

3

Honor, as the 1938 Act was proposed, and it doesn't seem

4

to make any sense to say that Congress in 1938 would

5

have had a partial exemption for just three kinds of

6

governmental entities and left the dozens of other

7

governmental entities subject to the Act without any

8

even own use exception, which would be a very

9

far-reaching kind of holding, and very unfair and

10

illogical to have in the one sense transit, parks,

11

recreation, et cetera, et cetera, all apply without any

12

exception at all, and to just pick these three, schools,

13

hospitals, and libraries, and say, well, those are the

14

only three to which we will give a partial exception.

15

It seems to me much more logical to say, as

16

Mr. Teagarden indicated in his written report, that the

17

Act didn't apply to — the original Act didn't apply to

18

government at all, and the Court has said on many

19

occasions that post-enactment history can be persuasive

evidence, not conclusive, but persuasive.

that was to — the Subcommittee's reaction was to render

15

a report saying, well, it can be enforced against

16

private charitable, eleemosynary institutions if they

17

don't comply with the '38 exemption, but didn't say

18

anything about applying the Act to governmental

purchases where they compete.

It's a situation where, to take the words of

prior Court opinions, there has been public

controversy.

24

and that is persuasive evidence, in light of all the

facts that we have, under traditional criteria applied

And taking all that into account, and

combining it with the statement by Mr. Teagarden that as

a matter of statutory construction Congress can be

assured that the Act will not apply to governmental

have competitive bidding and to purchase at cheapest

prices.

Teagarden said, don't worry about it.

12

the government, then they are not covered, and the issue

13

is not whether this was correct statutory interpretation

14

or not, as the Court recently pointed out in the Merrill

15

Lynch and the Brown case.

16

Congress perceive this, not whether or not the statutory

17

construction was correct, although I think that there is

18

support which we cite and discuss in our brief for the

19

point that this statutory construction is correct.

20

That's what Congress was concerned about.

Mr.

If you leave out

The question is, how did

I should point out also that in -- there have

21

been — in two of the cases, one the Saks case, that

22

dealt with sales to government liquor stores, and the

23

General Shale case dealt with construction, these are

24

both situations where the government did not compete,

25

and this was an alternative ground of holding, but one

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

ground of holding was that the Bobinson-Patman Act did

2

not mean to cover government sales in the first place.

3

I would like to also point out in answer to

4

the question which was asked earlier of the Petitioner

5

that hospitals doing the dispensing of pharmaceuticals

6

and the giving of public health care is a traditional

7

governmental function.

found, and the Court in National League of Cities so

held.

The district court here so

There are just two brief points that I want to

11

make quickly that are discussed in the brief.

12

that the state has argued in its brief, and I am going

13

to mention the point, that in order to avoid significant

14

questions under the Tenth Amendment, that the Court

15

should construe the statute so as not to apply to

16

governmental purchases.

17

One is

The other is that in view of the almost

18

universally recognized inapplicability of the statute to

19

governmental purchases for 46 years, if the Court

20

should, and I don't think there is basis, but if the

21

Court should decide this issue of first impression, then

22

there should not be a retroactive application which

23

would upset not only the states' allocations, cost

24

computations, how they determine what programs to have,

25

what prices are going to be charged, but also have a lot

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

of treble damage liability in cases both against states

3

the manufacturers of drugs in this particular case, but

4

the manufacturers of every single product, every single

5

commodity which are sold to state and governmental

6

agencies.

7

And I emphasize again in conclusion that this

8

is not a case which is limited to drugs or hospitals.

9

This is a very, very far-reaching case which would go to

10

the very heart of everything that states buy, and all

11

the cost allocations which states have made, all the

12

programs which they have in place which are based upon

13

the prices which they have been able to get at lower
