ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDMUND B. KORAN, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

10

MR. KORANs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
These cases were brought pursuant to Title 42

11

of the United States Code, Section 1983.

12

issue that is being presented to this Court for decision

13

is whether a police officer who commits perjury during a

14

state court criminal trial should be granted absolute

15

immunity from civil liability under Title 42, United

16

States Cole, Section 1983.

17

The precise

It is the contention of the Petitioners that

18

such absolute immunity should not be extended to police

19

officers who have perjured themselves during state court

20

criminal trials, and that there are four fundamental

21

reasons why such absolute immunity should not be

22

extended to police officers.

23

The first of these reasons is that qualified

24

good faith immunity as oppose! to absolute immunity has

25

generally been observed by this Court to be the

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

predominant standard in civil rights actions where

2

immunity questions are raised.

3

that qualified good faith immunity gives an opportunity

4

to a civil rights defendant to defend the case, but at

5

the same time, gives the civil rights plaintiff an

6

opportunity to attempt to make a case out of a violation

7

of his constitutional rights.

8

9

The Court has recognize that the qualified
good faith immunity does apply to police officers.

10

Secondly --

11

QUESTION;

12
13

The Court has recognized

May I interrupt you there, Mr.

Moran?
How could an officer who committed perjury

14

ever discharge the burden of proving that he did so in

15

good faith?

16

MR. KORAN;

I don't believe he ca n if, indeed,

17

it has been shown that he committed perjury .

18

words, Justice Stevens —

19

QUESTION :

20

MR. MORAN*

In other

Then the good faith —
-- I do not think tha t if there is

21

conclusive proof of perjury, that it could ever be

22

assumed that it was given in good faith.

23

only significance that qualified good faith immunity has

24

in this context would be where the police o fficer would

25

be allowed to offer evidence in response to the charges

I think the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that he believed the statements he made at the criminal

2

trial for the truth.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. KORAN:

5

QUESTION:

Then it wouldn't be pgrjury.
And that would not be perjury.
So that you are really saying that

6

there is no defense to a complaint against a police

7

officer that he committed perjury at a trial with regard

8

to a relevant fact.

9

MR. MORAN:

I would say that that would be

10

true to the extent that good faith is not consistent

11

with perjury.

12

QUESTION:

So that there -- when you say there

13

should be no absolute immunity/ you really are also

14

saying there should be no immunity, period.

15

MR. MORAN:

In a sense, yes, except that a few

16

courts that have viewed the situation have considered

17

that perhaps there would be what they have characterized

18

as a qualified good faith immunity in the sense that the

19

police officer would be allowed to come forward with

20

evidence to show that he believed the statements to be

21

true.

22

don't think. — I think the two are essentially mutually

23

inconsistent.

But I essentially agree with your position.

24

QUESTION:

MR. KORAN:

Yes.

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

passed with the very idea that there would be a civil

2

damages remedy for a constitutional violation, and as

3

the Petitioners have attempted to show in their briefs,

4

there are indications from studies that have been

5

conducted with respect to criminal prosecutions under 18

6

USC 242 that there may not be in effect any true

7

deterrent effect as a result of that, so that the

8

recognized benefit attendant to Section 1983 actions,

9

that there might be a deterrent effect through the

10

bringing of those actions, would be enhanced by a

11

finding by the Court that they could be brought.

12

QUESTION:

But our cases here indicate that

13

Congress didn't really intend to nullify at least some

14

of the common law immunities --

MR. MORAN:

18

MR. MORAN:

19

QUESTION:

That the cases have found -What about that?

20

of common law about witnesses?

21

MR. MORAN:

What's the rule

The rule, as I perceive the

22

Court's cases with respect to absolute immunity, has

23

revolved around the observation that immunities in

24

general are accorded to government officials who are

25

sued under 1983 when the level of their discretion is so

2

characterized as decision-making, indeed, that almost

3

everything they do involves a decision.

4

granted immunity to judges, to prosecutors, to

5

legislators, as the Chief Judge pointed out, to

6

administrative law judges and the President.

7

QUESTION:

This Court has

Yes, but we’ve held that -- we’ve

8

held that Congress didn’t intend to nullify the kind

9

of -- those kinds of immunities.
MR. MORAN:

10

That’s true, but there are two

11

observations that are critical to this case that relates

12

to that.

13

did not intend to nullify an immunity if the legislative

14

history of the 1871 Civil Rights Act were silent on that

15

point.

16

42nd Congress was not silent on the point of whether it

17

considered perjury an act that should be condemned and

18

should be actionable under the 1871 Civil Rights Act.

19

Indeed, there are many comments throughout the

20

legislative history to the effect that perjury was to be

21

condemned, and that it indeed would be actionable under

22

Section 1983.

23

First of all, the Court has held that Congress

The Petitioners have taken the position that the

Furthermore, with respect to the question of

24

immunities not being automatically eliminated as a

25

result of the passage of the act, the Court's recent

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

pronouncements have indicated clearly that a simple

2

recognition of the fact that a common law immunity

3

existed does not end the inquiry, but that the Court

4

will consider the history of the particular immunity

5

suggested and determine under modern day policy reasons

6

whether that immunity should apply equally in the civil

7

rights context as it would in the common law context, as

8

it has been previous to the passage of the 1871 Civil

9

Rights Act.

10

QUESTION:

Can you suggest a reason why there

11

should be a special rule for civil rights cases with

12

respect to this very narrow matter?

13

MR. MORAN;

I would think that the most

14

significant reason why there should be a special rule

15

underlies the passage of the 1871 Civil Rights Act,

16

which was, I would suggest, the policy of Congress

17

finding that in creating a new tort under Section 1983,

18

there was in effect a much more serious aspect to that

19

kind of a tort, and that the aspect that was so serious

20

was that the tort was rendered by a governmental agent

21

who was found to have had power that could not be

22

wielded by the average person who might consider a

23

common, or might perpetrate a common law tort.

24
25

In that particular instance, the Congress
showed that it wanted to provide a damages remedy to a

victim of governmental overreaching
In the decision of this Court in Conroe v.

3

Pape, there was an explicit recognition by Justice

4

Harlan to the effect that Section

5

in its effort to recognize that a constitutional tort

6

was more significant than a common law tort.

7

Justice Harlan said, "The statute becomes more than a"

8

judicial -- "jurisdictional provision only if one

9

attributes to the enacting legislature the view that a

10

deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly

11

different from and more serious than a violation of a

12

state right and therefore deserves a different remedy

13

even though the same act may constitute both a state

14

tort and a deprivation of a constitutional act.

15

view, by no means unrealistic as a common-sense matter

16

1983 was significant

There

This

17

isla tive hi story than is a view that the primary

18

pose of the statute was to grant a lower court forum

19

20

fact fi ndi ngs. "
I think it's clear that the reason that there

21

can be and should be a special exception in this area

22

relates to the fact that the 42nd Congress considered a

23

tort committed by a governmental agent to be, indeed, a

24

very serious situation that should be actionable even

25

though it might not have been actionable under common

law
The question of immunities that have been

2
3

raised in the context of constitutional or civil rights

4

litigation has been addressed several times by the Court

5

in the last seven to eight years.

6

Court seems to have taken the direction that absolute

7

immunity will be considered to be the exception to the

8

rule, and that qualified good faith immunity would be

9

the predominant standard.

In doing so, the

In Butz v. Economou, the Court was asked to

10
11

decide the specific question of whether a civil rights

12

plaintiff could sue a cabinet-level officer for an

13

alleged defamation.

15

allowed to bring an action against the Secretary of

16

Agriculture.

17

to this Court's attention two prior decisions rendered

18

by it, Spalding v. Vilas and Barr v. Hatteo.

19

those actions were essentially common law defamation

20

actions which eventually resulted in decisions by this

21

Court to the effect that the defendants in those cases

22

were absolutely immune from damages in a common law

23

action .

that and specifically indicated that if there was a

3

common law immunity for the common law action of

4

defamation, that immunity would not be extended to the

context, and the Court upheld the right of the plaintiff

7

to bring that action.

Economou, the Court refused to do

8

Thus, we have seen that there was specifically

9

a contraction of immunities that were observed in common

10

law but were considered — but that the Court considered

11

it necessary to contract the scope of those immunities

12

in the constitutional tort context.

13

The Court has extended absolute immunity that

14

was found in common law, in many instances in ages-old

15

common law immunity situations.

judges in Pierson v. Ray, to administrative law judges

17

in Butz v. Economou, to prosecutors in Imbler v.

18

Pachtman, to legislators in Tenney v. Brandhove, and to

19

the President in Nixon v. Fitzgerald.

20

common thread through all of those decisions has been

21

that if absolute immunity were not extended to the

22

people who performed the functions attendant to those

23

offices, indeed, the very functioning of the government

24

insofar as it was embodied in the activities inherent in

25

those offices, might be paralyzed, the basic idea being

It has extended it to

However, the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

that if a person were deterred from going ahead and

2

making significant decisions through intimidation or

3

harassment that might be attendant to a possible lawsuit

4

brought against them for conducting those activities,

5

that an immunity, an absolute immunity should attach to

6

those activities.
It has been the Petitioners' contention

7
8

throughout this lawsuit that there is no decisionmaking

9

involved in testifying in a judicial proceeding, and

10

that there, in fact, is no discretion in any material

11

sense involved in testifying in that a witness is

12

required to testify completely and truthfully to

13

questions that are put to him during the judicial

14

proceeding.
QUESTION:

15

Well, in all of the absolute

16

immunity cases, isn’t the basic idea that the particular

17

person should be relieved even from the burden of

18

defending the lawsuits?

19

MR. MORAN:

20

QUESTION:

That is true.
That they can be harassed to the

21

detriment of the performance of their duties simply by

22

lawsuits, even if they win the lawsuits.
MR. MORAN:

23

That has always been considered to

24

be a countervailing factor with respect to civil rights

25

lawsuits.

There is no doubt about that.

But the Court

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

has continued to recognize that even though there is, in

2

essence, a down side to allowing civil rights plaintiffs

3

to bring civil rights lawsuits against governmental

4

agents, even in recognition of a detraction, so to

5

speak, from the performance of their normal duties will

6

be allowed so that the purposes behind Section 1983 will

7

be advanced, and that a person who is a victim of

8

constitutional violations can gain compensation for that

9

act.

And indeed, in the case of police officers', which

10

is being presented to this Court now, in both Monroe v.

11

Pape and Pierson v. Bay, the Court said that police

12

officers would be held to only be gualifiably immune

13

from civil rights actions for nearly everything that

14

they had to do during the course of their duties.

15

It would be the Petitioners’ contention that

16

testifying by police officers is simply another one of

17

their duties and that, indeed,

18

interrupted from their duties and might be forced to

19

come to court and defend their actions in such a

20

lawsuit, this would be just considered the cost of going

21

ahead and allowing a civil rights plaintiff to bring a

22

proper 1983 action.

23

2UESTI3N i

although they might be

Mr. Moran, I am a little puzzled by

24

your emphasis of these witnesses as police officers.

25

They are not asserting their immunity because they are

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

police; they are asserting it because they are

2

witnesses.

3

Isn't that a different approach?

4

MR. MORAN;

That's true, Your Honor, they are

5

asserting it because they are witnesses, and I think

6

that it is the only way that they can approach the

7

situation from the standpoint that, as the Court has

8

indicated recently, the functional aspect of an analysis

9

on this point is significant.

However, it's also

10

important to recognize that if the questioned activity

11

is a constitutional violation and that it is performed

12

under the color of state law, that it then will be

13

actionable under 1983.

14

It’s bean the Petitioners' contention that

15

this activity, even when characterized as being giving

16

testimony during judicial proceedings, is given under

17

the color of state law.

18
19
20

QUESTION;

Mr. Moran, may I interrupt you on

this -- on that point?
It is critical to your case that the perjury

21

be a constitutional violation, as I understand your

22

presentation, and as I understand the constitutional

23

rule, mere perjury isn't a constitutional violation;

24

it’s the knowing use of perjured testimony.

25

Does that not require you to prove that the

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

prosecutor was a party to the perjury?

2

MR. MORAN:

it is our p etition that it would

3

not so require. Justice Stevens.

4

Court’s holding, first in Mooney v. Hollahan, and later

5

in Nappew v.

6

has been held by this Court that the knowing use of

7

perjured testimony by government prosecutors will result

8

in a due process violation.

9

Of course, under this

Illinois and Giglio v. United States, it

However,

the Petitioner s would take the

10

position that the general holding in those cases applies

11

equally to the present cases.

12

QUESTION:

13

Even if the prosecutor did not know

of the alleged perjury.

14

MR. KORAN:

Yes, and the reason that the

15

Petitioners have taken that position consistently is

16

that there is a knowing use by the state of perjured

17

testimony when the perjuring witness is a representative

18

of the state.

19

is only a logical extension of the holdings of the Court

20

in, for instance, Nappew v. Illinois.

In other words, we would suggest that it

QUESTION:

21

Well, does that mean that every

criminal conviction in which the defendant could later

23

demonstrate that there was some perjury committed by

24

some state representative, is subject to collateral

attack ?

Doesn't every citizen have a duty

to come forward to testify when required to do so?
HR. HORAN*

6

If a subpoena has been served on

7

any citizen, yes, he would be required to respond to the

8

subpoena, but the question of the word "duty” takes on

9

particular significance with respect to a police

10

officer.

11

consistently that in the case of police officers, it is

12

a duty in the sense of a job responsibility, that

13

routinely and systematically the police officers have to

14

come to court in order to testify as to the results of

15

their investigatory activities.

16

It has been the Petitioners’ position

It is in that sense that it is a duty of the

17

police officer to respond --

18

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose public defenders

19

have a duty to come forward into court and defend the

20

defendants whom they are appointed to represent, but the

21

Court didn't find that that made it acting under color

22

of state law.

23

HR. HORAN*

That is true, Your Honor, but in

24

the decision in Polk County v. Dodson, the Court

25

recognized the basic nature behind the public defender’s

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

duties as being, not so much residing in the fact that

2

he was an agent of the state or an employee of the state

3

or county, that the traditional lawyer-client

4

relationship is the predominant standard by which a

5

public defender's actions would be determined.

-

Thus, you have a very different qualitative

that there is a departure between actual authority and

Dennis v. Sparks where a state court judge was said to

have corruptly conspired with parties during a state

that there should in fact be derivative immunity granted

recognized that the state court judge indeed was immune

to have corruptly conspired with the judge could be sued

QUESTION:

Mr. Moran, the Court of Appeal did

MR. MORAN:

Your Honor,-in Footnote 4 in the

13

Court of Appeals decision, the Court addressed the

14

under-color-of-law question and expressed an opinion

15

that if they were to go ahead and decide that issue

16

directly on the merits, that they would find that such

17

an argument, that the testimony wasn't given under the

18

color of state law, would not call for a dismissal of

19

the case, and they said that if evidence could be

a police officer to testify, that the under-color-of-law

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

10

MS. LIPKIN;

Thank you.

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court;

12

Petitioners argue that police officers, when

13

acting as witnesses, are entitled to only a qualified

14

immunity from liability pursuant to 42 USC Section

15

1983.

16

including police officers, are entitled to absolute

17

civil immunity for their testimony.

We respectfully submit that all witnesses,

This Court has long held that the broad

18
19

language contained in 42 USC Section 1983 providing a

20

remedy to individuals deprived of rights by every person

21

acting under color of law was not intended to be applied

22

as stringently as it reads.

23

two-part test that has applied when a government

24

official has claimed entitlement to immunity from 1983

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

also substantial legislative history indicating that the

2

42nd Congress was very concerned about the corruption of

3

state court judges, and this legislative history is very

4

clearly discussed by Justice Douglas in his dissenting

5

decision in Pierson v. Pay.

6

However, although this legislative history was

7

there, this Court noted that immunities well grounded in

8

history and reason were not intended to be abrogated by

9

the covert language contained in Section 1983.
QUESTION:

10

So you're saying that the Ku Klux

11

Klan Act does not mean what it says or what its

12

legislative history indicates.
KS. LIPKIN:

13

Certainly this Court has

19

discussed some common law immunities it has not

Professor Prosser and by the restatement of torts, and

7

this Court similarly noted in Imbler v. Pachtman that

8

witnesses are absolutely privileged for words spoken

9

during the course of a judicial proceeding.

10

Public policy requires that all witnesses,

11

including police officers, be granted absolute civil

12

immunity for their testimony.

13

granting witnesses absolute civil immunity is the

14

concern that witnesses will be intimidated and harassed

and will not speak freely if their testimony may become

the subject of future civil litigation.

this Court has also noted that prosecutors may be

its previous immunity decisions.
As we have stated previously, it is the

12
13

function of the 1983 defendant rather than his official

14

title, that will determine whether he is to be granted

15

absolute civil immunity.
Thus, in the case of the police officer who

16
17

testifies, he acts as a witness because in a courtroom

18

he is treated like any other witness.
In addition, if police officers are not

19
20

granted absolute civil immunity for their testimony,

there will be a virtual retrial of the criminal offense

In addition, if police officers are not

2
3

granted absolute civil immunity, they may become the

4

only witnesses not granted absolute witness immunity,-

5

and of course, the American courts have never created

6

distinctions between witnesses.
In the alternative, if police officers are

7

8

granted only a qualified immunity for their testimony,

9

the result may be an extension of this qualified

10

immunity to other government witnesses, such as medical

11

examiners, court-appointed psychiatrists or county

surveyors.

Petitioners also argue that police officers

testify with a badge of authority, creating a likelihood

that they will be believed, even if they present

testimony that is neither true nor credible.

many other witnesses, such as physicians or

psychologists, also testify with a badge of authority

recognized as experts in their field.

12

Of course, it is the responsibility of the

13

trier of fact to sift through conflicting testimony in

order to resolve the dispute based in part upon the

15

credibility of the witnesses, regardless of whether the

16

witness is a government witness or has received many

graduate degrees.

18

Petitioners also argue that a qualified

immunity will not place an undue burden upon the police

20

officer witness because ha is already accustomed to

21

civil rights liability in his other functions.

course, this argument ignores the functional analysis

that we discussed previously.

rights claims may be disposed of quickly through the use

in question, a trial will probably be necessary in order

to resolve the dispute.

civil rights liability for other witnesses allegedly

perjured testimony.

9

We would also like to note that the thrust of

10

Petitioners’ argument is that absolute immunity will be

11

used as a cloak behind which the clever and deceptive

12

witness will hide, enabling him to lie without fear of

civil liability.

absolute civil immunity granted to every other witness.

QUESTION;

9

Kay I ask you one question before

Certainly, Justice Stevens.
Do you think on the record before

us that in any case there is a showing of perjury?

10

MS. LIPKIN;

11

QUESTION;

No, Your Honor, I do not.
I wonder if you really need the

12

absolute immunity defense then.

13

MS. LIPKIN;

Your Honor, when the District

14

Court decided, it held that there was not perjury.

15

also held that this would not be actionable because

16

witnesses were entitled to absolute civil immunity,

17

the action was not taken under color of law, and that

18

there was no deprivation of rights.

19

the entire case up on appeal, and the Court of Appeals

20

addressed the immunity question, finding it to be

21

paramount, and did not reach the other issues.

But it is only in the case where

there really is perjury that you need the immunity.

Where there is a prima facie

showing of perjury.

3

MS. LIPKIN:

Well, Your Hono r, in either way,

4

what we would suggest is that a trial would be necessary

in order to resolve the dispute.

would be the constant dread of retalia tion that Justice

Learned Hand talked about.

didn’t perjure himself, isn’t it?

MS. LIPKIN:

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. LIPKIN:

I would say so, Your Honor.
Even on the recor d before us.
Your Honor, wha t we are trying to

14

do here is, obviously, to have the dec ision of the Court

15

of Appeals affirmed, but in addition, we would suggest

16

that absolute witness immunity is nece ssary be cause

17

police officers should be treated as a ny other witness

18

and granted absolute witness immunity.

QUESTION:

And at the outset of the case have

20

the complaint dismissed if what it cla ims is liability

21

for perjury.

22

MS. LIPKIN:

QUESTION:

Merely the claim, the claim that

24

perjury was committed invokes automati cally the witness

privilege, does it not?
