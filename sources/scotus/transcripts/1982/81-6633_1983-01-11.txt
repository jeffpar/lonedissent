ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. LOHR, ESQ.,

7

APPOINTED BY THIS COURT, PRO HAC VICE

8

MR. LOHR*

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case involves the revocation of

10

an indigent's probation for his failure to pay a fine

11

and restitution which was imposed as a condition of his

12

probation.
Mr. Bearden has received a three-year probated

13
14

sentence.

The condition was that he pay $750 as fine

15

and restitution.

16

almost immediately.

17

Within the next four months, he had to come up with and

18

pay the balance, which is $550.

Two hundred dollars had to be paid
This was paid by his parents.

Approximately one month after this sentence

19
20

was imposed, he was laid off.

He became unemployed.

21

From that period until the time of the revocation

22

hearing, he did not gain employment, although the record

23

shows that he tried to gain employment.

24

funds.

25

might call functionally indigent.

He was without property.

He was without

The trial court hell the revocation hearing

and revoked it on two grounds, as I understand what the

3

trial court did.

4

the fine and restitution.

5

his failure to report to his probation officer

6

regularly.

7

the petition to revoke.

Secondly, it revoked it on

That, of course, was not a ground stated in

In fact, I don't believe there was any

8

9

It revoked it on his failure to pay

evidence to support that finding, and the Georgia Court

10

of Appeals held that even if the trial court did rely

11

upon the failure to revoke the probation — or revoke

12

the probation for- his failure to report, that the

13

revocation rested upon an alternate independent ground

14

which was sufficient, and that was that he failed to pay

15

his fine and restitution, which was a condition of his

16

probation.

17

The Georgia Supreme Court denied a petition to

18

review this discretionary appeal, and there are two

19

other important factors I should mention in this case.

20

First of all, the petitioner was serving his probation

21

under what we call the Georgia First Offenders Act.

22

Under that Act, when a person is convicted or enters a

23

plea of guilty, the court suspends further proceedings

24

and places him on probation.

25

If he successfully completes his term of

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

probation, he is discharged without an adjudication of

2

guilt, no criminal record, no criminal purpose.

3

other hand, if his probation is revoked, the trial court

4

then at the revocation hearing enter an adjudication of

5

guilt and sentence the defendant to any sentence that it

6

could have originally imposed.

7

have been 20 years for the burglary and ten years for

8

the theft by receiving.

In this case, it would

The only condition is that he must be given

credit for the time that he was on probation.
Now, in this case, when the trial court

11
12

originally revoked his probation, it sentenced him to

13

five years to serve.

14

probation.

15

a motion on behalf of the defendant, this was reduced to

16

the remaining balance of his probation, in line with the

17

Georgia case of Stevens versus State.

18

It was a three-year term of

It sentenced him to five years to serve.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Lohr, do you think that a

19

sentencing judge can at an original sentencing

20

proceeding consider the fact that the defendant is

21

indigent and couldn’t pay a fine, and therefore decide

22

to sentence the person to jail?

Would that be valid?

23

MR. LOHRs

In lieu of a fine?

24

QUESTION:

The sentencing judge, who has

25

On

options available to him at sentencing, the possibility

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of a jail term, the possibility of a fine, the

2

possibility of probation on condition that a fine is

3

paid, can the sentencing judge decide that because the

4

person in fact is unemployed and indigent, and therefore

5

unlikely that he could pay a fine, and would be a poor

6

risk on probation, should be sentenced to jail?

7

all right?

8

9

HR. L0HR<

Is that

I think, if I might answer that

question, if a high level of scrutiny is to be applied

10

to this type of state action, I don't think it is okay.

11

If a low level is, then I think it is.

12

explain, as I understand your hypothetical, the person

13

could have been placed on probation except for the fact

14

that he couldn't pay the fine.

15

that there is no additional threat to society.

16

nothing being achieved by protecting society simply

17

because he was poor.

If I might

That indicates to me
There is

18

As far as rehabilitation goes, I don't think

19

the state is achieving anything by putting him in jail

20

for rehabilitation under these circumstances.

21

How, there is the element of deterrence, let's

22

say, to other individuals.

For example, other indigents

23

may see this indigent — in their mind he may be getting

24

off scot free.

25

have to pay a fine because he is too poor, and he

In other words, he is not — doesn't

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

doesn't have to go to jail.

There are other ways that

2

the state can enforce or achieve the policy of

3

deterrence other than the payment of a fine or jail.

4

Those aren't the only two options.
So, if we look at strict scrutiny, so to

5
6

speak, it is not necessary to put him in jail.

There

7

are other less intrusive ways to accomplish that

8

deterrence.

9

then I think the judge can do it, so long as the fine is

10

— or the jail term is in some way commensurate with the

11

f ine.

If we are looking at just a rational basis,

12

Now, the second point I just want to mention,

13

that I am sure you are aware of, that the fact that his

14

probation was revoked because he was too poor to pay the

15

fine resulted in the adjudication of guilt which has

16

several other consequences, among which he loses his

17

right to vote, he loses his right to hold public office,

18

and certain other rights that citizens who are not

19

convicted of a felony of moral turpitude hold.
First of all, I would like to consider the

20
21

cases of Williams versus Illinois and Tate versus

22

Short.

23

Illinois held that it was unconstitutional to

24

incarcerate the defendant beyond the limits of

25

incarceration which by statute apparently the state

determined as necessary to achieve the penalogical

2

interests of the state.
Now, in this present case, apparently the

3
4

trial judge made a determination that this individual

5

did not need to go to jail in order to satisfy the

6

penalogical interests of the state.

7

legislative determination.

8

the trial judge.
QUESTION;

9

It wasn't a

It was apparently done by

The trial judge, I take it, thought

10

that what you referred to as perhaps inartfully, at

11

least in my opinion, less intrusive methods might be

12

used to achieve society's goal without having to send

13

him to jail at that stage.
MR. L0HR«

14

That’s correct.

The probation and

15

the other — and the conditions that were imposed upon

16

his probation would satisfy the penalogical interests of

17

the state.

18
19
20

QUESTION;

What were the conditions that were

They were the standard -- in

imposed?

21

addition to the fine and restitution, they were the

22

standard conditions, not to associate with —

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Yes, but fine and restitution were

the two non-boilerplate conditions.
MR. LOHR;

That’s correct.

Those were the

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

only two non-boilerplate conditions.
QUESTION;

2

Did the defendant ever ask to have

3

that term of condition modified — term of probation

4

modified or extended or reduced or --

5

MR. LOHR:

No, he never made that request.

6

QUESTION;

He had that right, I suppose, under

MR. LOHR;

Yes, the trial judge retains the

7

state law.

8

9

jurisdiction over probation cases beyond that term of

10

court for the term of probation, and I think at any time

11

the trial court could upon a reasonable showing modify

12

the conditions of probation.
QUESTION;

13

Do you know if — do you know if

14

the obligation, the condition about restitution and

15

paying a fine, did they survive the revocation of

16

probation?

17

MR. LOHR;

I have not —

18

QUESTION;

Or do you know?

19

MR. LOHR;

I have not been able to find any

20
21

cases right on point on this —
QUESTION;

Well, I know, but in this

22

particular case, if he went to jail, was he free from

23

tha conditions of paying the fine?

24
25

HR. LOHR:

I don't believe he is.

I believe

he is going to be obligated to pay the fine and

until he pays it.

3

in fact.
QUESTION*

4

It probably will never be collected,

At the time restitution was

5

requested of him, did he make any showing or statement

6

to the judge that he was indigent and therefore couldn't

7

make restitution?

12

13

We have searched for it, and we can't find

I was not present at that time.
QUESTION*

So we have to presume that

14

everything that was done to support the

15

constitutionality of the order below was done, since we

16

don 11 know?

17

HR. LOHR*

/
Well, the only thing we have in the

18

record is that in his testimony on his probation

19

revocation hearing, he did testify that he agreed to pay

20

the fine at the time the condition of probation was

21

entered, and I am assuming that he agreed to it.

22

a job at that time, and felt like he could pay it.

23
24
25

QUESTION*

He had

Well, what did he steal, or what

was the theft?
MR. LOHR*

The burglary, and I think the theft

by receipt, were one and the — arose out of the same

2

incident, but it was breaking into a mobile home and

3

apparently taking some items out of the mobile home.
QUESTION;

4
5

Was there any finding of the value

of the items?
HR. LOHR;

6

Again, I really don’t know.

There

7

is no record of what happened back when he was placed on

8

probation.

9

So I don't know what -QUESTION;

Any indication of what he did with

10

those items?

11

have made restitution if he had simply still had the

12

property by just giving the property back.

13

I mean, at one point I presume he could

HR. LOHR;

All I can — All I can represent to

14

this Court is what the District Attorney has led me to

15

believe in talking to him, the one that was apparently

16

there at the time.

17

QUESTION;

Your argument really then is quite

18

abstract, isn't it, and quite apart from the particulars

19

of this case, where your client was convicted of theft,

20

presumably at one time had the ability to make

21

restitution, accepted a sentence imposing restitution,

22

and now simply wants to shed the whole thing.

23

HR. LOHR;

Well, we are assuming some things

24

here, and I don't know that in fact he had the ability

25

to make restitution out of the goods that were stolen.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

Well, but if you don't know, if the

2

record is silent, isn't there a presumption in a case

3

such as this that the findings are in support of

4

constitutionality?
QUESTION;

5

Doesn't the record show that as a

6

matter of fact the only way he paid the original $200

7

was to pay it from his mother?

8

HR. LOHR;

That's true.

9

QUESTION;

And that he didn't even have it?

10

HR. LOHR;

At the time —

11

QUESTION;

Doesn't the record show that?

12

MR. LOHR;

Yes, it does.

13

He either borrowed

it or his mother gave it to him to pay.

That's correct.

14

QUESTION;

The record shows that.

15

MR. LOHR;

That's correct.

16

And he had a job

at the time, and about a month later became laid off.
QUESTION;

17

Doesn't the record also show the

18

amount of the restitution, the $200 on one charge and

19

$50 on the other?
MR. LOHR;

That was the restitution.

22

QUESTION;

So isn't it fair to assume that's

23

the amount he had to restore?

24

value of what he stole?

20
21

25

That's

correct.

MR. LOHR:

I mean, that must be the

It would seem reasonable to assume

12

that, yes
QUESTION:

2

It is also true, isn't it, that

3

your client signed the order of probation in which in

4

effect he agreed that in violation of the terms of

5

probation the court may enter an adjudication of guilt

and proceed as provided by law?

MR. LOHR:

him at that time.

That's correct.

In the case of Tate against Short, again,

13

this

14

Court, in citing from a concurring opinion in Morris

15

versus Schoonfield, stated that it doesn't matter if the

16

fine is accompanied by a jail term or not, and again, in

17

this case, it was not -- it was not accompanied by a

18

jail term, but only by a probationary period of time.

It still held there that it is in violation of

And it appears that that is what we — what

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

happened here, and it wasn't any attempt by the trial

2

court to substitute a jail term equivalent to the $550

3

he owed.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Is there some table from which the

trial court could have found an equivalent term?
HR. LOHR;

That poses a real difficult problem

7

with that — with that approach, simply because how do

8

you know how much one day is worth?

9

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you were arguing

10

that — the intimation seemed to be that the trial judge

11

should have made the effort.

I agree with you.

12

it would be quite difficult.

Then why do you argue that

13

he should have made the effort?

14

HR. LOHR:

I think

The only reason I guess I made that

15

point is, it has been suggested — I believe it was in

16

Justice White's opinion in Wood against Georgia that

17

there should be some — when a person's probation is

18

revoked for his failure to pay a fine, that there should

19

be some relationship between the amount of jail time and

20

the amount of the fine, and I guess the reason for that

21

is is that apparently the state needs some — needs to

22

satisfy its interest in deterrence, satisfy its interest

23

in retribution.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, do you think the suggestion

is that perhaps the judge should consider the nature of

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the offense, and decide considering the offense and the

2

nature of the defendant what punishment is appropriate,

3

whether it is jail, or a fine, or in either case how

4

much or how long it should be?

5

MR. LOHRi

Well, I think the Judge has wide

6

discretion at the time of sentencing, at the time he

7

places a person on probation or puts him in jail or

8

imposes a fine.

9

think he needs to maintain that.

10

I think he has wide discretion.

QUESTION:

I

Do you think that a judge who is

11

considering whether to continue someone on probation

12

should reasonably consider whether the person has a job,

13

and if not, the extent to which he is a risk to society,

14

being a convicted felon and not having employment?

15

that appropriate?

16

MR. LDHR:

Is

I don’t think it’s appropriate to

17

consider that a person who does not have a job becomes a

18

greater risk to society than a person under the exact

19

same circumstances that does have a job, or a person

20

that is poor is a greater risk to society than an

21

individual who is rich under the exact same

22

circumstances.

23

judge's ability just to look at whether or not the

24

person is rich or poor, I don’t think they should

25

consider that in making that initial determination.

So, if we are looking at the trial

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

Do you think — historically in the

2

books there were a lot of provisions that prescribed the

3

punishment for a certain criminal act, 30 days or $30.

4

Now, here is a legislative judgment.

5

legislature said, if you steal something that is worth

6

$200, you either pay a $100 fine or go to jail for five

7

days.

8

you can't pay the $100, you have got to do something, so

9

we are going to send you to jail for five days.

Those are equivalent.

MR. LOHRs

10

Suppose a

And we just think that if

Again, I am going to have to answer

11

that, if you apply the strict scrutiny approach, I think

12

there are other .ways that the state can accomplish its

13

interests.
QUESTION;

14
15

Well, that is just shorthand for

saying that you think that the statute is bad.
MR. L0HR*

16

That's correct.

That's correct.

17

But you see, there would be other ways then that the

18

state could accomplish its same deterrent interest.

19
20
21

QUESTION;

Well, the legislature didn't think

MR. LOHRs

It seems to me that if a person is

so.

22

unable to pay — Now, for a person that could pay, it

23

may be a legitimate choice, but for a person that is

24

unable to pay, he really has no choice at all.

25

just, go to jail, for him.

It is

It seems to me that there

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

should be some other type of provision made, that the

2

state could, with some sort of a work release program,

3

have him do public service work.

4

options open to the state.

5

There are all sorts of

And just because it is not paid immediately

6

does not mean that it may not be paid down the road.

7

So, for a person who is indigent, I don't believe that

8

that is a valid option.

9

QUESTION:

But wouldn't that depend a good

10

deal on the crime committed?

11

that plead guilty to burglary.

12

of crimes that would not suggest that the individual

13

would be a very good risk. So if you have no alternative

14

but to him on work relief or doing public service, would

15

that not be a bit dangerous for the public generally?

16

MR. LOHR:

Well,

You have an individual
I can think of all sorts

I think the determination of

17

whether or not a person is a risk to society, is going

18

to pose a threat to the other individuals around him,

19

needs to be made independently of whether or not this

20

person is rich or poor.

21

QUESTION*

Right.

Right.

22

MR. LOHR;

Now, I agree that in a case of

23

burglary, it woull seem — if you compared it to a

24

traffic violation —

25

QUESTION*

Surely.

— there is a greater probability

2

that the court is going to find that he needs to be

3

incarcerated to protect society, but apparently that is

4

not the situation in this case.

5

QUESTION;

Have you considered that one of the

6

consequences, if you prevail, is that judges in the

7

courts dealing with these — matters of this kind are

8

going to have a tendency, or at least they are going to

9
10

be encouraged to simply impose — have several
«
alternatives:
impose a fine, saying, if you pay this

11

fine in cash or post a bond within 48 hours, then the

12

sentence will be suspended; otherwise, imprisonment —

13

that that may be the tendency, or the judges will, as a

14

second alternative, simply forget about restitution and

15

all, which is beginning to be rather illusory, and

16

simply convict and send all these people to prison?
MR. LOHR:

17

I have considered that.

For an

18

indigent, it really doesn't make a lot of difference.

19

He can't pay the fine, and if it is a condition of being

20

free, he is not free.

21

so he is going to go to jail, regardless of what the

22

judges do.

23

QUESTION;

By definition, he can’t pay it,

Well, he may be able to get

24

somebody to put up a bond, if they can't lend him the

25

money, to put up a bond to see that it is paid.

the Court, in this case, the petitioner raises an equal

2

protection challenge to the revocation of his

3

probation.

4

that this Court has often recognized to be vested in

5

trial courts.

At stake is the broad sentencing discretion

6

I would like to say at the outset that the

7

equal protection issue here is not the typical equal

8

protection question this Court faces.

9

protection issues involve broad, sweeping legislative

10

action that is at least to some degree over-inclusive.

11

Here we have a single sentencing decision by a single

12

trial court, highly individualized, a revocation of

13

probation which was an act of discretion by a trial

14

court.
That is one reason why the respondent submits

15
16

that the Court should employ the reasonable basis test

17

of equal protection review.

18

conditions this Court has specified in the past to the

19

application of higher scrutiny are simply not met in

Another reason why the respondent —

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose the defendant who

is on probation has some kind of a liberty interest in

remaining out of jail, does he not?

circumstances would be arbitrary, and therefore would

violate the equal protection clause.

QUESTION;

All right.

What saves it here,

18

where he says, I lost my job, and I have been trying to

19

get work, and I can’t, so I can’t pay the fine.

20

MR. WEAVER;

Justice O'Connor, I think the

21

trial court could rationally have concluded that the

22

petitioner's loss of his job and his failure to pay the

23

fine, his inability to pay the fine from the record

24

increased or made him a less acceptable probation risk.

25

It seems to me that that follows from the ability of a

even though there were employees under both of those

schemes who could still perform the tasks.

The Court held that the

in the other to use age as an index to the physical

capabilities of workers, even though there are

exceptions.
Similarly, in the case before the Court, the

respondent submits that it is reasonable for a trial

as an index to the likely probation success of the

I think that is what the issue in

the case is.

17

MR. WEAVER;

QUESTION;

19

and the judge says,

One has $500, and a job that pays $10,000 a year, and

release the other one.

23

Could he?

24
25

Yes, sir.

Now —

Suppose the original case comes up,
there are two people involved here.

MR. WEAVER;

He couldn’t do that, could he?

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

I

think a trial court can consider the financial condition

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of the defendant in sentencing him, but if there is that

2

kind of wide disparity, I think, you might even have an

3

Eighth Amendment problem, a cruel and unusual punishment

4

situation, where you have that kind of

5

disproportionality between sentences for people who have

6

committed the same crime.
QUESTIONj

7

Wouldn't some of the consideration

8

you are talking about depend on the crime with which the

9

person was charged?

I mean, a trial judge could

10

reasonably suppose, I suppose, that a person who was

11

indigent would be more likely to commit petty theft than

12

someone who had $100,000 in the bank, but I suppose he

13

could also suppose that the one with the $100,000 in the

14

bank might be more likely to kite a large check than the

15

person who was indigent.
BE. WEAVER:

16
17

Both of them are crimes.

Yes, sir.

I think a trial court

could reasonably come to those conclusions.
Now, let me make it clear.

18

I am not saying

19

that the conclusion that this defendant was a greater

20

probation risk is the only conclusion the trial court

21

could have come to, but under the rationality standard,

22

it is not required that there be no reasons to the

23

contrary.

erected insurmountable barriers to indigents seeking a

25

review of their criminal convictions, and in Ross versus

Moffitt, which Justice Rehnquist wrote, the Court said
that although those prior cases could be fit — they
could be fitted under either the due process or the
equal protection clause, that the Court considered them
to be best explained under the equal protection clause.
Now, I would like to address myself to this
issue.

My opponent has mentioned Williams versus

Illinois and Tate versus Short.

In those cases, this

Court decided that the additional punishment imposed
upon indigents solely because of their indigency served
no legitimate state interest.
QUESTION*

And therefore violated what?

MR. WEAVER*
clause, I would say.

Well, the equal protection
The Court pointed out that when

the two defendants in those cases were sentenced, there
was a declaration by the state that the state's penal
interests did not require the additional punishment
later imposed upon the indigents.
Now, in the case before the Court, I submit
that there is no -- even assuming that analysis, there
is no declaration by the state that the state's penal
interest is satisfied here without imprisonment.
have to remember, this is a probation case.

You

Tate versus

Short and Williams versus Illinois were not probation
cases.

This defendant, this petitioner was put on

35

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

probation, which is a conditional release, and he has to
comply with certain conditions of probation.

So, it is

a tentative release.
Moreover, in this case, the petitioner was put
under the First Offenders Act of Georgia.

The Georgia

Supreme Court has said in a case called State versus
Wiley, which is at 233 Georgia 316, that the purposes of,
first offender's probation are not the same as ordinary
probation.

The Court has said that unlike other

probated sentences, the defendant is not merely serving
his sentence outside the confines of prison, but is
serving a period on probation to determine whether or
not the prisoner may be rehabilitated.
So, first offender's probation in Georgia is
even more tentative than ordinary probation.

So I

submit we don't have a declaration here as in Tate and
Williams that the state's penal interest was satisfied
without imprisonment.
Now, I would like to also point out to the
Court that the revocation in this case can rationally be
argued to help maintain public confidence in the
criminal justice system.

Surely, public confidence

would seriously be eroded if a person like the
petitioner could not only escape imprisonment, but even
escape a conviction without having kept the conditions

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

of his sentence.

And this concern is especially great

here, because the petitioner was sentenced under the
First Offenders Act of Georgia.

Not only will he escape

imprisonment, but also a conviction.
Respondent submits that to maintain public
respect for the administration of justice, this
revocation, this state action here can rationally be
seen as furthering that interest.
In summary, Your Honor, what we have here is a
trial court faced with a difficult sentencing decision.
The trial court was faced with a defendant who had plead
guilty to burglary and theft by receiving charges.

He

He says that he can

pay a small fine and restitution, and he appears to be

Based on those premises, the trial court
places him on probation, gives him a very lenient
sentence, and even gives him the benefit of the First
Offenders Act.

Eight months later, the petitioner comes

back in for revocation of his probation.

He has failed

He has not paid his fine and

restitution, and is now unemployed.
Now, a lot of questions could be asked about
the trial court's decision to revoke probation.

It

could be asked whether it is wise, enlightened,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. LOHR, ESQ.,

MR. LOHRs

Mr. Chief Justice, I have just a

couple of points.

17

state’s position, it is that the petitioner’s loss of

18

his job and his inability to pay his fine and

19

restitution placed him in the position of being easily

21

believe it is a false assumption, the one that was

22

disapproved of in Griffin versus Illinois.

First of all, as I understand the

I disagree with that.

I

And the state seems to be riding a different

Therefore, it meets the dictates of

24

horse.

It is not saying that the failure to pay the

25

fine and the restitution was -- caused him to be a

greater threat to society.

It «as his indigency.

In

other words, the real reason for the revocation of his
probation was his indigency.
With regard to public confidence, it is hard
to pin down, but it seems to me that people are not
going to have much faith in a criminal justice system
that puts an individual in jail because he is poor and
under the same circumstances when a rich person is going
to be able to go free.

In Rodriguez, this Court

reviewed Griffin, Douglas, Williams, and Tate, and in
Justice Powell's opinion it was stated that where a
person because of lack of wealth was completely unable
to pay for a benefit, and as a result there was an
absolute deprivation of that benefit, that the Court has
struck down those types of state actions, and I submit
that in this case, because of his lack of wealth, he was
unable to pay for the benefits which flow from being on
first offender’s probation, and that he was completely
deprived of those benefits.
For these reasons, I would respectfully submit
that this Court should reverse the Georgia Court of
Appeals.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

The case is submitted.
