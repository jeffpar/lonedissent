ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TRUITTJ

please the Court:
There are two issues presented in this

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

appeal:

The first issue is whether or not purchasers of

10

registered securities who

ay sue under section 11 of

11

the Securities Act of 1933 may also have recourse to the

12

implied remedies permitted under section 17(a) of the

13

Securities Act of 1933 and under Rule 10(b)5 of the

14

Securities Act of 1934.
The second issue is whether in such implied

16

remedies cases the standar

standard.

of evidence is the clear and
reponderance of the evidence

It is a firm

20

of certified public accountants with offices in Detroit,

21

Michigan.

International Speedway in connection with a public

23

offering of securities which occurred in November of

24

1969 in the heyday of the "go-go period."

25

of securities was underwritten on a firm commitment

Herman & MacLean were the auditors for Texas

Is that a term of art, "go-go

period" or —
MR. TRUITT;

6

I think it has gotten to be, Your

7

Honor.

It's a term which has been applied frequently.

8

I think there's a book called "The Go-Go Years," which

9

describes the period, the period of the late '60s and

10

early '70s, in which it seemed that purchasers or

11

investors —

MR. TRUITT:

The "go-go period" I would just

23

define as the period of the late '60s and early '70s

24

during which the appetite for speculative securities

25

seemed to be very high.

We've not had, except

QUESTION:

All right.

MR. TRUITT;

Now I knoui.

The operations of Texas

On November

7

Texas International Speedway filed a petition for

banrkuptcy under Chapter 10 of the federal bankruptcy

laws •
On August 25» 1972» which was approixmately 21

10
11

months after the filing of bankruptcy proceedings and

12

just short of 3 years after the effective date of the

13

public offering» the plaintiffs in this lawsuit filed

14

their action in the Federal Oistrict Court.
Section 11 of the Securities act of 1933 is a

15
16

piece of legislation directed specifically at public

17

offerings of securities.

18

designed specifically for the plaintiffs in this case.

19

Section 11 was intended by Congress to accomplish

20

certain things.

21

observed in Hochfelder, to make certain that all

22

material information necessary to permit an investor to

23

make an informed judgment would be available for that

24

investor.

25

It is a statute which was

It was intended to» as this Court has

It was also intended to enhance standards of

integrity and fair dealing through the imposition of

specified civil liabilities.

3

word for my purposes in that paraphrase of Hochfelder is

4

the term "specified."

5

And I think the operative

In order to protect the capital formation

6

process* Congress deemed it necessary to advise those

7

persons participating in public offerings as to what the

8

scope of their liabilities would be.

9

very specifically in section 11.

Congress did that

liability is.

In particular reference to my client* the

23

public accounting firm, by suing under 10Cb)5 rather

24

than section 11, the plaintiffs were permitted to allege

25

that accountants are responsible for non-accounting

fact that those materials not only were not expertised

expertised by other experts*

find in section 11 of the type of representation for

that it was expertised by engineers and not by

accountants» the plaintiffs by suing under 10(b)5 mere

QUESTION:

5

What is the theory on mhich they do

6

that» on mhich the plaintiffs seek to assess liability

7

against the accountants for something like that mhich

8

mas done —
MR. TRUITT:

9

Well, the plaintiffs allege both

10

that the accountants mer acting as principal and that

11

they mere acting as aiders and abettors? that is to say

12

that, even though they mere not responsible for those

13

estimates, they are charged mith knomledge of the

14

incorrectness of those estimates and that that knomledge

15

serves to satisfy the Scienter requirement of 10Cb)5 and

16

section 17.
QUESTION.

17
18

Where does the concept of aiders

and abettors in civil litigation come from?
MR. TRUITT:

19

It seems to me that it has been

20

borromed from the criminal lam mithout a great deal of

21

analysis.

22

lam.

23

that the elements are an awareness, a generalized

amareness, that there is some illegal activity going on

and the performance of some conduct mhich materialy

contributes to the accomplishment of the illegal purpose*
QUESTION:

2

Do any of the relevant securities

3

acts passed by Congress use the term "aiders and

4

abettors"?

5

MR. TRUITT:

QUESTION:

7

MR. TRUITT:

No» Your Honor» they do not.
Hoiu

about Committee Reports?

There» not in connection uiith the

8

'33 or '34 acts.

There was a Committee Report» there

9

uias a proposal» as I recall» in 1959 or 1960» to use the

10

term "aider and abettor" in application to certain

11

administrative processes.
But the Commission advised the Congress at

12

13

that time that the aider-and-abettor analysis would

14

apply only as regards administrative processes» SEC

15

regulation» and that it did not at that time regard the

16

aider-and-abettor concept as applicable for civil

17

purposes.

18

proposal was made did not come to fruition.

19

In any event» that legislation in which that

The other major accomplishment of suing under

20

17(a) and 10(b)5 rather than section 11 has to do with

21

the issue of damage.

22

11 are well defined and fairly restrictive.

23

principal restriction which is operative generally is

24

that a participant in the registration process is liable

25

only for an amount equal to the price at which the

The damages provisions of section

securities mere offered to the public.

2

you had a situation in tuhich securities offered to the

3

public at $5 a share and trade thereafter at 110 or $15

4

a share» notwithstanding that increase in price» the

5

participants in the registration process under section

6

11 are liable only for $5 per share.

7

Therefore» if

Another very important distinction in the area

8

of damages has to do with undewriters.

An underwriter

9

is generally liable only for that portion of the

10

securities undermritten by him.

11

where an underwriter receives compensation which is not

12

shared prorata with all other underwriters.

13

from that* that exception» an underwriter may be

14

responsible only for that portion of the securities

15

which he underwrites.

16

There is an exception

But aside

In the facts of the present case» that is

17

fairly graphically demonstrated by Russ & Company* which

18

I have chosen just because they're one of the smaller

19

underwriters.

20

units which were sold in this offering.

21

II the aggregate liability of Russ & Company would have

22

been $44*000.

23

statutes providing client remedies» the liability of

24

Russ £ Company would be $4,400*000» plus — plus — any

25

additional premium over and above that which might arise

They underwrote 30 units out of the 3*300

1

as a result of the fact that those securities trade at a

2

premium.
So the effect of permitting plaintiffs

3
4

recourse to 10(b)5 and 17(a) is to dramatically increase

5

the exposure of certain defendants.
One other significant effect is that section

6
7

11 only imposes liability on certain — certain

8

persons.

9

preparing a registration statement or bringing an

Not every participant in the process of

10

offering to market is even potentially liable.

12

section 11.

14

would have been paid for out of the funds of this

But

Finally» after a judgment was entered» the

22

defendants filed a motion for stay based upon a

3

heed his demand that the lawsuit be settled.

4

Normally» the causal relationship between a

7

than it is in this case.

8

the record in this case.

Sut I submit that it was on

The significance of this course of events in

9
10

this appeal and the point that I am trying to make is

11

that the section 11 because of its much greater

12

precision does not lend itself to these kinds of in

i»

13

terrorem tactics as does 10Cb)5* and therefore» the

14

integrity of section 11» I submit» should be preserved.
Getting over for a moment to the standard of

15
16

evidence issue as it relates to the resolution of the

17

overlapping remedies issue» the difficulty in briefing

18

and deciding the standard of evidence applicable in an

19

implied remedies case is the absence of any rule or

20

decision to point to to determine which standard should

21

apply.

22

After preparing our brief and reading the

23

other briefs» it seems to me that what it comes down to

24

is a subjective determination of the degree of

25

protection which the Court should extend to persons

15
ALDERSON REPORTINQ COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

accused of civil fraud, taking into account the special

2

damages to reputations uihich can follow from a fraud

3

judgment.

4

Now, I would point out that this problem is

5

not a problem in section 11 cases.

There's no need to

6

attempt to determine which standard of evidence applies,

7

because in a section 11 case the burden is on the

8

plaintiffs to go forward and show that a registration

9

statement is false and misleading.

But once that burden

10

is satisfied, then the burden is on the defendant to

11

establish defenses related to lack of culpability, which

12

every defendant other than the issuor has.

13

This is an example, it seems to me, of the

14

superiority of the section 11 cause of action, and we

15

don't find ourselves in this never-never world of trying

16

to determine by access to federal common law or by, as

17

is the case with respect to the statute of limitations,

18

by reference to what is deemed to be the most comparable

19

state statute of limitations period, the rule applicable

20

to the proceedings.

21

Now, the question presented in this appeal

22

seems to me to be a very straightforward one, and that

23

is, whether the federal courts are obligated to respect

24

the express statutory remedy for registered offerings

25

provided by Congress.

If the courts are obligated to

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

respect that statutory scheme»

2

of that scheme must be respected.

3

limitations period must be respected.

4

attributes of the express remedy must be respected.

5

When that occurs» it seems to me there's no room left

6

for th e existe nee of implied remedies.

evidence that would meet a clear and convincing standard

21

or to proof of all the elements of the 10(b) —

22

MR. JAFFE;

Justice O'Connor, that's a good

23

question because I don't know the answer.

This was a

24

sua sponte decision by the Fifth Circuit.

It was never

25

raised by any party.

standard is upheld by this Court as being the standard

in a civil fraud action.

5

I don't knot» what's going to

As to whether that's going to apply to the

6

element of materiality, whether it's going to apply to

7

the element of reliance» whether it's going to apply to

8

the element of causation» how are they going to break it

9

down?

It would seem to me that it seems to apply across

10

the board as to each particular element» as it's phrased

11

in the Fifth Circuit's decision.

12

knout what the answer would be» and I imagine if this

13

Court upheld that standard, it's going to have to be

14

explored on a case-by-case basis.

Very briefly» as to the statute of limitations
again» this Court has looked at the statute of

limitations question and in the sense of one of the

11

footnotes in Hochfelder saying that the state statute of

12

limitations apply.

13

believes some additional procedural limitations may be

14

applicable to 10(b)5.

15

think the plaintiffs have been under Rule 10(b)5» have

16

appropriately been following the decision of the Court.

17

It well may be that this Court

3ut it has not so ruled» and I

If Congress wanted to have a limitation» as

18

they did in another situation in the 1934 Act» in 1938

19

they amended a certain provision under 15(c)l to provide

20

for a 1-year and 3-year statute of limitations.

21

could have done so.

22

they have acquiesced in the decision of the courts to

23

allow a statute of limitations under 10(b)5 relating to

25

They have not done so.

rule that in this — this case is the — the facts of

this esse bring out the need not to have one remedy

exclude the other» but for the kind of relief uihich

4

Hochfelder saw would be appropriate* but in Scienter*

S

when an accountant acts under Scienter in connection

6

with false and misleading prospectus he can held liable

7

under 10Cb)5.
They also say that this case again is a good

case.

It's money damages.

Herman £ MacLean has not

10

alleged in any way they're prevented from making a

11

living then of going — they don't have to participate

12

in the fraud in the prospectus.

13

They have that choice.

They don't have to.

14

And if they don't want to participate in the fraud,

15

instead of not giving a comfort letter, what they could

16

— or of excluding — rather, giving a comfort letter,

17

excluding the question of construction, they said, they

18

should have said, let's not go forward with this issue,

19

we can't give you the comfort because we know that those

20

costs have greatly exceeded that in the prospectus;

21

therefore, let us revise the prospectus, be sure it sets

forth the accurate figures.

And then they would have

been free of any liability.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL GONSON, ESQ.,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE

4

MR. GONSONi

Mr. Chief Justice» and may it

please the Court:
In the Hochfelder case» the accountants there

5

urged that they should not be liable under section lOCb)

8

for mere negligence.

7

Scienter was required» becomes here have been found by a

8

jury to have acted with Scienter.

9

that they should not be held liable under section 10(b)

This Court agreed and held that

They ask this Court

10

because section 11 provides for liability for

11

negligence.

12

not covered under section 11.

13

And they also argue that their conduct is

Their argument is that Congress intended the

14

section 11 be the exclusive remedy for false statements

15

in a registered securities offering even where the

16

victims of that falsity cannot recover because section

17

11 does not apply to the persons or the conduct involved.

18

I will develop two responses.

First» the

19

Congress intended in 1975 when it comprehensively

20

amended the Securities and Exchange Act to continue the

21

section 10(b) remedy» including its cumulative nature»

22

and that the accountants have not carried their burden

23

of demonstrating that Congress intended to carve out

24

from that 10(b)5 remedy protection for buyers for

25

securities and registered offerings.

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Second* that the section 11 and lOCb) remedies

2

are very much different.

3

differences demonstrates Congress' intent that they

4

should coexist.

5

And an analysis of those

The central inquiry* we agree* as asked by

6

Justice White* is legislative intent.

7

noted in the Curran case that the inquiry logically

8

differs depending upon whether a court is considering

9

new legislation or legislation that Congress amended

10
11

And this Court

following its enactment.
We point out in our brief that the Securities

12

Acts have been amended on a number of occasions* the

13

Securities Exchange Act in 1964» 1975» and 1977.

14

focus on 1975 because in that year Congress

15

comprehensively examined and strengthened the Securities

16

and Exchange Act.

17

amended 47 provisions* and left 85 provisions unchanged.

18

It established a new national market system* a

I will

It added 55 provisions to that Act*

19

new system to clear and settle transactions in

20

securities* and a new system bringing municipal

21

securities dealers under federal regulation* greatly

22

strengthen SEC regulatory authority over securities

23

brokers and securities exchanges.

24

remedies available for SEC enforcement* but no new

25

private remedies were added* nor were any changes made

It strengthened the

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

in the express private remedies* nor uias section lOCb)

2

touched.

3

Now» there can be no doubt that in 1975 the

4

consensus of judicial opinion regarding the availability

5

of the section 10(b) private action was older and even

6

more overwhelming than the development of the implied

7

private action under the Commodity Exchange Act that was

8

upheld in Curran.

9

The extensive section 10(b) case law included

10

many federal court decisions holding that a section

11

10(b) remedy was available even though the conduct may

12

have been covered by express remedy* including courts of

13

appeals decisions from six circuits.

14

were a great many decisions allowing recovery under

15

section 10(b) without any discussion at all of whether

16

an express remedy would apply* although from the facts

17

of those cases it appears that such express remedies

18

probably would have applied* again establishing the

19

widespread acceptance of the cumulative nature of the

20

10(b) remedy.

21

In addition* there

Congress was also presumably aware in 1975 of

22

this Court's statement in 1969 in the National

23

Securities case that section 10(b) was the most

24

litigated provision of the federal securities laws and

25

that some overlap in section 10(b) with other sections

37
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

2

is neither unusual nor inappropriate.
So thus for the same reasons that Congress'

3

reexamination and amendment of the securities lau/s

4

serves to ratify the existence of a private right of

5

action generally under section 10(b)» it serves also to

6

ratify conspicuous and a uniformly accepted

7

characteristic of that right of action in 1975» its

8

cumulative and supplemental nature.

9

Indeed, the argument for the cumulative nature

10

of the 10(b) remedy is a fortiori from Curran.

11

this Court held that neui remedies added in 1974 to the

12

Commodities Exchange Act, arbitration and reparations,

13

mere limited and narrow in scope.

14

for the implied remedy either as a means of compensating

15

injured traders or as a means of enforcing compliance

16

with the statute.

17

There

It did not substitute

As mentioned, Congress created no new remedies

18

in the Securities Exchange Act of 1975» adding strength

19

to the presumption that it intended to continue the

20

cumulative nature of the 10(b)5 remedy very well

21

established in the case law.

22

In addition to legislative ratification

23

applying to the cumulative nature of the 10(b)5 remedy,

24

there is no evidence that Congress intended section 11

25

to be the exclusive remedy for investors defrauded in a

registered securities offering.

In section 16 of the

2

Securities Act Congress stated the rights and remedies

3

in that Act shall be in addition to any and all other

4

rights which may exist in law and equity.

5

a similar provision in the Securities and Exchange Act.

6

Beyond that» Congress declared the purpose in

And there is

7

section 2 of the Securities and Exchange Act to impose

8

requirements necessary to securities regulation and

9

control reasonably complete and effective.

This

10

comported with President Roosevelt's call for securities

11

legislation with teeth in it.

12

And now to the comparison of the section 11

13

and 10Cb)5 remedies.

14

while detailed» is quite narrow in what it covers.

15

has already been pointed out» it reaches a list of

And

10

not only in 10(b) must the plaintiff prove Scienter» but

11

he has the burden of proving Scienter.
In a section 11 action the defendant has the

12

13

burden of showing absence for negligence.

As the Second

14

Circuit pointed out in Ross v. Robbins» cited in our

15

brief» there is often a failure of proof and the party

16

who has the burden then» of course» loses.
Now» because this remedy under section 11

17
18

favored plaintiffs so substantially» Congress did not

19

extend this remedy to all conduct or to all persons.

20

And moreover» to prevent abuse of the remedy» Congress

21

provided for costs» attorney's fees in some cases» and a

That» in a sense» is the

Our point is that because 10(b) is a different
remedy and a more difficult one to sustain» if the

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-6300

1

plaintiff is able to sustain it and proves fraud and the

2

other components of the remedy» then he ought to be

3

entitled to the remedy.

4

the defendants the trade-off advantages of the short

5

statute» security for costs and so on that are found in

6

section 11.

7

And there is no reason to give

Indeed» more than 30 years ago Fishman v.

8

Raytheon pointed out that the recognition that section

9

10(b) as a different remedy provided the classical

10

reconciliation of the express and the implied remedies.

11

Fishman was noted by this Court in Hochfelder where this

12

Court's holding that Scienter is required under section

13

10(b) rested» in part» on the premise that the 10(b)

14

remedy is cumulative of the express remedies in the

15

Securities Act.

16

As this Court noted in Hochfelder, precisely

17

because conduct which is actionable under sections 11

18

and 12(2) also is actionable under section 10(b).

19

Adoption of the negligence standard underlO(b), as was

20

urged in that case, would "allow causes of action

21

covered by sections 11 and 12(2) to be brought instead

22

under section 10(b) and thereby nullify the efectiveness

23

of the carefully drawn procedural restrictions on those

24

express actions.

25

a higher culpability standard under section 10(b).

So this overlap provided a reason for

I close on the point I opened with:

The

expert* where their conduct is alleged to have gone —

5

to go much beyond that.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — RE3UTTAL

18

MR. TRUITT:

Thank you.

I want to address

19

myself first to the what I understand to be the line of

20

argument that this Court in Hochfelder has approved the

21

holding in Fishman.

22

this Court in the Hochfelder case assumed the

23

possibility that the Fishman analysis was correct and

24

the possibility that there were overlapping remedies.

25

think it's important to note that in that place in the

I think that's not true.

I think

I

1

Hochfelder opinion whore the language is found to which

2

counsel refers* the Court cites not only the Fishman

3

case* which holds that there is an overlapping remedy*

4

it also cites the Rosenberg case* which holds that there

5

is not.
I think it's clearly the case because of the

6
7

fact that the Court has left open the implied remedy

8

issue* not only where the overlap is between 10(b)5 and

9

11 but also in other situations where the overlap is

10

between 10(b)5 and section 18 of the '34 Act.

11

important to note that the Court has left that issue

12

open.

13

Court held in Hochfelder that the implied remedies* that

14

overlapping remedies are to be permitted.

15

It is

I don't think it's appropriate to say that the

Now* if I can address my attention just for a

16

moment to the legislative renactment line of argument.

17

It seems to me that that line of argument* in effect*

18

reverses the role of Congress and the courts.

19

assumes first that it is the function of this Court to

20

enact legislation to establish remedies.

21

function of Congress* and where Congress has enacted

22

legislation* to establish remedies* and where it has

23

said that a person may be liable in them circumstances

24

and not in those, it's not appropriate for the Court

25

through exercising a trade-off or in any other fashion

It

That is the

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to override those limitations established by Congress.
Even more importantly for the legislative

2
3

renactment argument» it assumes that it is the function

4

of the Congress to monitor the rulings of the lower

5

federal courts and where those rulings are incorrect» to

6

reverse them by means of amendatory legislation.

7

not the function of Congress* that's the function of the

8

courts of appeals and of this Court.

That's

One other serious problem with the legislative

9
10

reenactment doctrine is that it applies only in those

11

circumstances where the holding in question does not

12

bear the weight of legal analysis.

Thirdly» I think that there is a distinction

19

which is sometimes missed between awareness of a holding

20

and ratification of that holding.

22
