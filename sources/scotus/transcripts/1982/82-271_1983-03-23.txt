ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. DE GOOYER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

HR. DE GOOYERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9

please the Court, nine years ago this Court, in American

10

Pipe and Construction Company versus Utah, held that the

11

statute of limitations is temporarily suspended in

12

federal class actions until the District Court

13

determines whether to certify the class.

14

The issue in the case before the Court this

15

morning is whether the rule of American Pipe applies to

16

federal class actions brought under the Civil Rights Act

17

of 1866.

We think, the answer to that is clearly yes.
A number of lower courts have held that it

18
19

applies, and only one court to our knowledge, and that

20

is the court below in the instant case, has held that it

21

does not.

22

The relevant facts are few and undisputed.

23

The Respondents are teachers in the Department of

24

Education of Puerto Rico.

year, they received formal notification that their

Toward the end of that

4

appointments would not be renewed.
Approximately one year later, in June of 1978,

5

a teacher who had received notification of

6

non-reappointment, Mr. Jose Ortiz Rivera, who is not a

7

respondent in this case, brought an action in the

8

Federal District Court in Puerto Rico as a class action

9

on behalf of himself and a class of persons who he

10

contended had been victims of discrimination on account
of their political beliefs.

2

Relief was sought under 42 United States Code

3

Section 1983, and pendent state claims were asserted.

4

The defendants were the petitioners in this case.

5

It is undisputed that as of the date Ortiz

6

Rivera filed his class action, the statute of

7

limitations had not yet run against the respondents.

8

Approximately two months after the lawsuit had been

9

filed, the District Court denied class certification on

20

the grounds that the class was not so numerous as to

21

make joinder impracticable.

22

It is undisputed that thereafter none of the

23

respondents took any action on their own behalf to press

24

their claims against the petitioners for five months,

25

until January of 1979, when they brought individual

and in each answer asserted as an affirmative defense

3

that the statute of limitations had run.

The petitioners filed answers in each case.

Eventually, the cases were consolidated for

trial, bifurcated on the issue of liability and

damages.

Judgment was finally entered.

12

the Court recognized that if the rule of American Pipe

13

and Construction Company were applied here, the statute

14

of limitations would have been suspended when Ortiz

15

Rivera filed his lawsuit, but that it would have resumed

16

running when class certification was denied, and that

17

the statute would have expired as to each respondent

18

before and indeed well before his individual action was

19

filed.

20

actions had been timely filed.

Although

The court concluded, however, that it could

21

not apply American Pipe and Construction Company because

22

of this Court's decision in Board of Regents versus

23

Tomanio, and the court below specifically held on the

24

basis of that decision that the rule of American Pipe

25

and Construction does not apply to cases brought under

Section 1983 of Title 42.

2

Instead, the court felt constrained to look, to

3

state law to find the tolling rule.

4

the court looked to state law, or Puerto Pico law, it

5

found, and I quote, "no discernible state rule”

6

applicable to class actions, it fashioned a rule.

11

It

Under that rule, the entire original statutory

period of limitations began to run anew.

respondent therefore had another year within which to

bring a lawsuit, even though at the time the class suit

had been filed most of them had about three weeks left

1

Mr. DeGooyer, that the last paragraph of the Court

opinion in American Pipe and Construction, which at
m

least your opponents read to suggest made that the

suspension aspect of the ruling depend on the Clayton

5

Act rather than on a rule peculiar to federal class

action?

8

MR. DE GOOYER;

Right.

entirely, Justice Rehnquist.

9

QUESTION;

I disagree with that

I think that that —

You disagree with my statement or

10

with your opponent’s — what I think is your opponent’s

11

view?

12

MR. DE G00YER;

I agree with your statement

13

that the opinion so reads.

14

that the American Pipe rule, the suspension aspect of

15

the American Pipe rule is in any way dependent upon the

16

Clayton Act.

17

of course they are not controlling, but there are

18

numerous cases cited in our brief where lower courts

19

have used the suspension rule in Title 7 cases, in

20

various kinds of cases, securities cases, but more

21

importantly to me, at least, was this Court's decision

22

in United Airlines versus McDonald.

23

I disagree with the notion

There are numerous lower court cases, and

That case was decided three and a half years

24

after American Pipe and Construction Company.

In that

25

case, and it was a Title 7 case, the eight members of

1

the court that decided that case all sat on the American

2

Pipe court, which was unanimously decided.

3

the United Airlines case was whether or not American

4

Pipe and Construction Company had any application, and

5

while the majority and the minority disagreed as to the

6

scope of the rule, no one disputed the fact that the

7

rule would have applicability in a Title 7 case, and

8

indeed the minority so stated.

9
10

The issue in

So, I don't have any problem with that at
all.

I think there is no limitation there.
Contrary to what the First Circuit held, we

11
12

believe that the American Pipe rule controls this case,

13

that it is a uniform rule of federal procedure, that it

14

applies generally to all class actions, regardless of

15

subject matter and regardless of the statute of

16

limitations that is applicable.
And as I have just discussed, I think that the

17

s

■>

18

Clayton Act in no way gave the rule its suspension

19

aspect.

20

rule is two rules, as the respondents contend.

21

no basis in the American Pipe opinion for that, in my

22

judgment, and no court has ever held that this is

23

actually two rules.

24

means stopping temporarily.

25

what the Court was doing in establishing the rule.

At the same time, we do not believe that the

It

1

was protecting the District Court from a flurry of

2

activity while it decided whether to certify the class.

3

As the Court said in American Pipe, Rule 23 is

4

eviscerated if people will be coming in, filing

5

protective motions to intervene while the Court is

6

deciding whether it is a class or not.

7

satisfies the needs of judicial efficiency and economy

9

parties as of the date the class suit was filed.

The

10

analogy I use is, it is snapshot.

11

the obligations of the parties are fixed at that point.

point.

3UE3TIOS:

— by applying — by saying that

2

Puerto Rico would in effect apply a counterpart to the

3

American Pipe case, but is it not true that with respect

4

to the second question, namely, for how long the tolling

5

period is, that they relied on Puerto Rico law for

6

saying the statute starts to run all over again.

7

MR. DE G00YERt

Puerto Rico law in a different

8

context, Justice Stevens, if I may.

The statute that is

9

being construed, the Puerto Rico statute that is

10

involved in Section 5303 of Title 31.

11

specifically refers to the three methods of tolling

12

under Puerto Rico law.

13

tolling has properly occurred in Puerto Rico, that the

14

statutory period begins running anew, but the

15

authorities in Puerto Rico law are absolutely crystal

16

clear that the tolling in Puerto Rico must be not only

17

strictly construed by restrictively construed, and I

18

refer to the case of Diaz versus — Diaz de Deana that

19

we have cited in our brief.

20

That statute very

There is no question that when

Because the result is a running anew, even the

21

courts of Puerto Rico say that you must restrictively

22

interpret that rule of tolling.

23

QUESTIONi

So your position really, if I

24

understand you correctly, is not that they tolled it for

25

the wrong period, but there should have been no tolling

MR. DE G00YER*

That's correct.

That's

correct.

discussed, that the rule of American Pipe itself is two

5

rules.

6

general tolling rule and a precise tolling effect rule.

7

They derive that, as Justice Rehnquist suggested, from

8

the language in the last paragraph of American Pipe,

9

where the Court was saying it remains to determine the

Yet the respondents maintain, as we just

That is, the federal rule is two rules, a

10

precise effect the commencement of the action had on the

11

statute of limitations.

12

I think in our brief we make clear at least

13

this is our view that that was the Court's recapping,

14

where we stood at the time the lawsuit was filed.

15

Eleven days left to run in the statute.

16

came eight days after class certification was denied.

17

That was lass than alaven days, therefore timely filed.

Well, but it would have been -- my

11

question is, what law would — what statute of

12

limitations would apply?

13

HR. DE G00YER;

We would use the one-year

14

Puerto Rico statute of limitations, which we are in fact

15

using right now.

QUESTION;

And if there was some claim of

tolling in the case, it would be Puerto Rico law, too?

HR. DE GOOYER;

Yes, indeed.

Yes.

action is involved here.

4

MR. DE GOOYER*

now you say that Puerto Rico law

I certainly do say that, and I

5

also say it is very easy to say in this case, because

6

there is no Puerto Rico law that covers this situation

7

as the First Circuit so said.

8

QUESTION*

9

distinct positions.

10
11

But those are really two quite

MR. DE GOOYER;

They are indeed two

questions.

12

QUESTION*

I take it your underlying position

13

is that American Pipe is based on the Rule 23 class

14

actions —

15

MR. DE GOOYER*

16

QUESTION*

Absolutely.

— and provides a federal rule of

17

tolling no matter what the substantive origin of the

18

claim.

19

MR. DE GOOYER*

That is entirely correct.

20

That is our position entirely.

And that satisfy’s the

21

Rule’s Enabling Act as far as we are concerned.

22

it is interesting to look at the reasons why the

23

respondents have looked at this rule of American Pipe as

24

two rules.

25

of American Pipe and said, we will take the benefit of

I think

They have carved up the general tolling part

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 82S-9300

1

that

2

They have then said, we will go to the Puerto

3

Rico running a new rule, and we will take the benefit of

4

that, and by the way, that gives us a substantive right

5

to one year under Puerto Rico law, and the circularity

6

of this reasoning is fairly amazing, because now that

7

they’ve had the substantive right derived from American

8

Pipe, they turn around and say American Pipe cannot

9

abridge that right and therefore violates the Rules

10

Enabling Act.
They cite a number of cases in their brief

11
12

that refer to limitations, that allegedly give them a

13

substantive right to one year's worth of tolling, where

14

in fact those cases talk about the limitations of

15

actions being substantive in Puerto Rico.

16

is why the tolling statute in Puerto Rico is to be

17

restrictively construed, not merely strictly construed.

That indeed

In any case, as Justice Rehnquist suggests, it

18
19

is our position that the rule of American Pipe clearly

20

regulates only procedure in the federal courts in class

21

actions.

presented there was, did the pendency of Nary Tomanio's

11

state claims toll the running of the statute as to her

12

constitutional claims.

13

New York law had no rule, had no statute.

So

14

the lower courts fashioned the federal tolling rule to

15

preserve her constitutional claims, essentially in

16

furtherance of their view of federalism.

17

found the absence of a tolling statute in New York to

18

mean that New York intended no tolling to occur, and

19

that therefore the interests of federalism were better

served by following the New York no tolling rule.

If that principle were applied to this case,

there would be no tolling at all.

HR. DE G00YER:

I don't — well, let me say,

2

what the First Circuit did was this, Justice Rehnquist.

3

They took the federal rule of American Pipe, which they

4

acknowledged to be the federal rule.

5

this case acknowledged that to be the federal rule.

6

They have even said it mandates general tolling.

the First Circuit said was, there is no rule in Puerto

do.

1

this Court will defer to a circuit court in its judgment

2

of what a state law may be, but the only way they have

3

derived the so-called state law here is to say by

4

analogy the federal court has a Rule 23.

5

has interpreted Rule 23 to mean this.

6

that if Rule 23 and American Pipe apply, the federal

7

rule, the federal interpretation of this very Rule 23,

here is what happens;

American Pipe

We acknowledge

suspension, resumption, and

They then go and by analogy move into rule —

11

the comparable rule in Puerto Rico of procedure, and

12

they say it is modeled exactly after the federal rule,

13

but we think that Puerto Rico will not follow the

14

federal rule even though it is patterned after that.

15

will take the tolling portion of it and then apply the

16

running anew portion.

17

QUESTION;

It

Well, I understand your position to

18

be that even if the Puerto Rico law was just as clear as

19

a bell, that you would -- that American Pipe, to the

20

contrary, American Pipe would still govern.

MR. DE 300YER ;

Yes.

Even if there was a Puerto Rico

rule that said, after tolling, the period starts running

24

all over again, even if it was perfectly clear.

8

raised in the questions presented was whether the rule

of American Pipe and Construction Company, which is a

10

federal rule, applies, and indeed — anything in this

11

Court's decision in Board of Regents versus Tomanio

12

would preclude application.

13

QUESTION;

Sure, but you did not raise a

14

dispute with the Court of Appeals* interpretation of

Puerto Rican law.
MR. DE GOOYER;

That is certainly correct,

MR. DE GOOYER;

— with your argument, if I

21

understand it correctly.

22

the Court of Appeals first found that there was no

Puerto Rican authority for tolling in the first

instance.

MR. DE GOOYER;

I understood you to say that

That is the way I read it

MR. DE G00YER*

I have the opinion.

If you

will forgive me for one moment, I will look.

11

(Pause.)

12

QUESTION*

It says the substantive claims

13

asserted in the class action were identical to those in

14

the subsequent individual actions.

15

MR. DE G00YER*

Well, in the first point -- in

16

the first place, that — the Puerto Rico rule of

17

identical actions does not cover the circumstance.

18

There is no case anywhere that covers the identicality

19

question that the First Circuit drew on.
QUESTION*

20

Well, but there is a Puerto Rican

21

law — a rule that if it is an identical action, there

22

is a toll.

23
24
25

MR. DE G00YER*

By the same individual that

refiles, yes.
QUESTION*

And then the question is whether a

question, and —

3

MR. DE 300YER:

That's the

Well, indeed, as we have cited

4

in the Caguas Lumberyard case, there is authority to the

5

contrary that the filing of a purported class action by

6

a representative of the class does not involve any of

7

the other people is so-called parties to the action.

8

They are not advancing their action in court unless

9

those absent parties come in.

10

The way we read this is, you can't simply —

15

MR. DE GOOYER:

All right.
That is what the cases say.

16

Now, we have found the place that I was looking for, and

17

that is at least in the joint appendix at the top of

18

135-A, is where the Court says, "In the instant case,

19

though, there is no discernible state rule.”

20

after the Court has said that it feels that it must look

to state law because of 1988.

That is

It looks to Section 1988

Under those circumstances, we needn't even go

11

into the 1988 choice of law analysis, but as we have

12

also argued in the brief, Section 1988 provides on its

face that state law applies unless it is deficient.

state law.

to qualify for the federal preference under Section

Your Honor —

And what is your answer to that?
They are basing their primary

reliance on this Court's decision in the American Pipe

In so doing, we submit that they misread it.

Well, the American Pipe did hold

12

that in a class action the filing of the action tolls

13

and for just as long — up until the time the class

action is denied, and time then begins to run again.

15

MR. NAHMOD;

Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.

16

The American Pipe decision can be broken down into two

important aspects, it seems to me.

what we call in our brief general tolling.

QUESTIONS

So you say that the first part of

3

American Pipe doesn’t apply here either, as a federal

rule.
HR. NAHMODs

5

Your Honor, that depends upon

6

which one of our first two arguments one looks at.

It

7

seems to us with respect to an interpretation of

8

American Pipe that this Court held in American Pipe that
one looks at the limitation scheme underlying the

10

particular substantive cause of action.

11

the American Pipe case itself, the substantive cause of

12

action was Section 5(b) of the Clayton Act.

suspension approach to tolling.

this Court appropriately, in our opinion, looked to the

There are numerous — there are at least three

different approaches to tolling that this Court could

But it is a judicially created —
It may be, but it still is a

MR. NAHMOD*

But Your Honor, that brings us to

Section 1988, because Section 1988 sets out -QUESTION*

And suppose American Pipe had just

said that we — in so many words that this is the impact

of a filing of a glass action on the statute of

limitations in all kinds of actions, no matter what. We

just want to settle it.

15

HR. NAHMODs

And we would submit that because

16

of the mandate of Section 1988, that is improper to do,

17

in the same way that this Court rejected the propriety

18

of a judicially created rule of tolling in the Board of

Regents versus Tomanio case, in the same way this Court

20

rejected the propriety of a judicially created rule of

wouldn’t be deficient for purposes of 1988.
MR. NAHMOD*

If the earlier concession was

limited, we would still argue, even if Rule 23 governed

this, that one would have to still look at the

1t

underlying cause of action.

12

QUESTION*

13

MR. NAHMODi

14

QUESTION*

Well, I understand that.
For its limitation scheme.
But you are talking about really

15

fashioning a tolling rule in two different ways under

16

federal, aren’t you?

17

you fashion a federal rule solely for 1983 type cases

18

under 1988 rather than a federal rule all across the

19

board based on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

20

MR. NAHMODs

In Tomanio the question was, do

Yes, Your Honor.

We suggest that

21

when this Court spoke in the Tomanio case about Section

22

1988, it was basing its reading of Section 1988 on the

23

existence of a void in federal statutory law.

24

that the judicial tolling rule of American Pipe if such

25

should be is not a federal statute.

We submit

It is a judicially

whether that —

3
4

It doesn't matter, it seems to us,

QUESTION:

So it can’t supply the void, the

federal void for purposes of 1988?

5

HR. NAHMOD;

Not at all, no.

Section 1988 is

6

an independent — is a federal statute which this Court

7

must follow in Section 1983 cases and other cases to

8

which it might be applicable. This Court does not have

9

the power, we submit, under Section 1988, to create a

10

federal procedural common law in this — in this

11

respect, unless it is inconsistent, unless it is

12

inconsistent with the policy underlying Section 1983.

13

There has been no such claim by tha petitioners in these

14

cases.
QUESTIONS

15

In your view,

would the limitations

16

issue be any different if this litigation, which is an

17

individual litigation following the class action, had

18

been filed in the state court rathar than the federal

19

court?

20

MR. NAHMOD:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is one of

21

our points.

It seems to us that — it seems to us that

22

if indeed the petitioners are correct in their argument,

23

then it would make a difference whether a Section 1983

24

class action were brought in federal court or if it were

25

brought in state court, because surely with respect to

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62B-9300

1

what the state court would do, it would apply its own

2

tolling law of renewal,

3

QUESTION!

Well, not if Justice White's

4

hypothesis is right, that as a matter of federal law

5

which applies and which dictates the consequence of any

6

class action —

7

8

HR. NAHMODt

But that is only -- that is only

procedural.

9

QUESTION;

-- in any federal claim later

10

asserted, what difference would it make if the federal

11

claim --

12

HR. NAHHODs

Well, Your Honor, that would only

13

be, under Justice White's approach, a Rule 23

14

interpretation.

15

QUESTION;

16

HR. NAHHODs

Well, that's right.
Certainly, a Pule 23

interpretation does not bind a Puerto P.ico court or any

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

a procedural matter, under 1988, governed by state lav,

2

it seems to me your argument is just as strong whether

3

the individual’s action that follows the class action is

4

filed in federal court or in state court.

5

the distinction between —

6

MR. NAHMODi

I don’t see

Your Honor, our third argument is

7

relevant if this Court, first of all, rejects our narrow

8

reading of American Pipe, and secondly, it rejects our

9

Section 1988 argument with respect to a void in federal

10

statutory law, which we submit exists, because the

11

American Pipe rule is a judicially created rule of

12

tolling and does not apply, and is not federal statutory

13

law .

14

If the American Pipe case is a Rule 23

15

interpretation across the board, and it applies to all

16

federal class actions, including not just 1983 class

17

actions but diversity class actions, then we submit that

18

it would raise several -- some very serious problems

19

under the Rules Enabling Act, at least as applied to

20

these Puerto Rico plaintiffs, because the Rules Enabling

21

Act sets out a limitation on Congressional power and

22

this Court's power to promulgate rules of procedure.

23

Such rules must not abridge or modify substantive

24

rights.

25

The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has
41

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

characterized its limitation scheme as substantive.

2

Now, I grant you that is not enough, because whether

3

substantive rights are abridged by a federal rule is a

4

question of federal law, not a question predominantly of

5

state law, but yet this Court has in the past looked to

6

the importance of the particular limitations scheme or

7

the particular rule of the state and asked whether that

8

is substantive.

9

10

Now, the Court has done so on the Ragan case
and even more recently in the Walker case.

QUESTION*
it?

But that is Erie analysis, isn't

Ragan was basically an Erie type analysis.

3

MR. NAHMOD*

Yes, but we are using — that's

correct. Justice Rehnquist.

5

6

limitations and tolling provisions from one another.
QUESTION*

7

We are using Ragan and

What is the rule in diversity under

case.

22

That may have no application to a non-diversity

MR. NAHMODs

It may have no application to a

23

non-diversity case, Your Honor, but as we have argued,

24

this is a Section 1983 case, and Congress has left

25

certain matters silent in Section 1983 cases.

One of

Hr. Chief Justice, thank you.

Simply two points.

questioning of Justice Stevens and Justice O’Connor, I

8

wish certainly to make clear that while we disagree and

9

have disagreed with the First Circuit’s view of Puerto

10

Rico law, our position does not depend on a finding by

11

this Court that the First Circuit misconstrued Puerto

12

Rico law.

Particularly in response to the

13

Our position is that Rule 23 controls either

14

as an overriding general federal rule of procedure or,

15

if necessary, as the federal choice under Section 1988.

16

Finally, it must be kept in mind that, as we

17

have suggested to the Court, that there is a purpose to

18

be served by the rule of American Pipe.

19

to promote judicial efficiency and economy by providing

20

not only that the running of the statutes of limitations

be tolled, but that the tolling end as soon as it has

QUESTION*

3

Counsel, could I ask you a question

on American Pipe?

4

WE. DE G00YER*

5

QUESTION*

Yes, Justice Blackmun.

As I understand it, your position

6

is that American Pipe selected a suspension rule and

7

rejected a renewal rule, correct?
NR. DE G00YER*

8
9

I would certainly say it

selected a suspension rule, that’s correct, for the

10

reasons I have stated, and if that necessarily implies

11

rejecting a renewal rule, that is correct, but I don’t

12

know that we need reach that.

13

QUESTIONS

Well, my question isn’t really

14

whether that is isn’t dictum in American Pipe, because

15

under either rule those plaintiffs have been taken care

16

of.

17
18
19

NR. DE G00YER*

I am not certain I understand

your question. Justice Blackmun.
QUESTION*

Well, the plaintiffs’ claims there

20

were found to be timely under the suspension rule, but

21

wouldn't they have been timely under a renewal rule as

22

well, and therefore isn’t the statement on which you

Is that what Your

Let me start over again.

Your

7

position is that American Pipe selected a suspension

8

rule, and you hesitate a little by saying, well, maybe

9

it didn't reject a renewal rule, and my point is that

10

even if it did purport to select a suspension rule,

11

wouldn't that aspect of the decision be dictum?

12

MR. DE G00YER;

I think not.

I think what the

13

Court was doing was interposing the power of equity to

14

freeze the rights of the parties under the statute of

15

limitations as of the time the class action suit was

16

filed to determine whether the class action should be

17

maintained, and when it concluded that it should not,

18

equity removed itself from the -- from the law and the

19

statute simply resumed to run.
