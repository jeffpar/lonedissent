The avowed intent and purpose of the

2

conspiracy is to punish the petitioner, to strike ,back,

3

to retaliate, to pervert official power from its proper

4

purpose for having publicly observed and spoken up about

5

what he perceived to be rampant waste at George F.

6

Marshall Space Flight Center in North Alabama.

7

QUESTION*

Had he — does the record show to

8

what extent, if any, he had passed these notions and

9

ideas and his recommendations on up through channels

10

before he went public?

11

MR. ELRODs

The record reflects in a truncated

12

fashion, since this comes up from summary judgment, the

13

record reflects that the petitioner made some efforts

14

within the organization through his representative in

15

the manpower office to obtain some alleviation as to his

16

personal problem.

not alone in being misclassified or a round — or a

whom, Mr. Elrod?

2

MR, ELROD*

By the what was then called the

3

Appeals Review Board of what was then called the Civil

4

Service Commission.

5

lawsuit, the Bivens claim and all, was already pending,

6

not before the administrative proceedings had begun but

7

they were pending concurrently because an Alabama

8

statute of limitations would, in my judgment, possibly

9

have cut off one of the claims that is not present

That happened in mid-passage.

before the Court had the suit not been filed when it was

11

filed.

12

included within the petition.

I say not present before the Court, it's not
It's in the record.

13

As I understand the government's brief in this

14

case, the government concedes what it candidly describes

15

as petitioner's well — the well-established

16

constitutional right which the petitioner asserts.

17

the government disputes is the petitioner's right -- or

18

is whether the petitioner has a Bivens-type remedy for

19

the impairment of that right.

20

What

In effect, the government currently, in

21

defense of an opinion rendered on remand by a Court of

22

Appeals, currently espouses the second branch of the

23

Carlson against Green formulation as to whether an

24

alternative remedy or as to whether there is a basis for

25

barring or defeating at the threshold a Bivens-type

2

Congress had manifested its intent.

3

into an area of semantics, but it specifically —

4

explicitly states, but I will say clearly manifests its

5

intent that an alternative remedy which it has adopted

6

is intended as a substitute for a Bivens-type action and

7

is viewed by Congress —

And that second ground, of course, is that

QUESTION:

9

MR. ELRODi

10

I don't want to get

Mr. Elrod.

QUESTIONS

Yes, ma'am.
I suppose it's your position on

11

behalf of Mr. Bush that what was lacking here was a

12

right to obtain compensatory damages for embarrassment

13

or anxiety resulting from the demotion, and the failure

14

to have a means of getting punitive damages and

15

attorney's fees.

Is that right?

16

MR. ELRODs

17

QUESTION;

18

In damage terms -Those are the elements that are

lacking in the Civil Service remedies?

19

MR. ELRODs

20

QUESTION;

It is —
And is it your position then that

21

denying Mr. Bush the right to get those elements of

22

damages violates the Constitution?

23

MR. ELRODs

It is my position that it would,

24

although I am speaking to a judicial tribunal, that it

25

would be an invidious kind of distinction.

QUESTION;

Well, would it violate the

Constitution —

3

MR. ELROD;

4

QUESTION;

5
6

Yes, ma’am, I think it would.
— to — and what provision of the

Con stitution ?
MR. ELROD;

I lid not — it would — it would,

7

in my judgment, and I realize that I am venturing where

8

in — rushing in where some people fear to tred — in my

9

judgment, a decision that the denial of the dignitary
o

10

elements of a government employee’s claim in a

11

Bivens-type suit otherwise well grounded, assuming that,

12

of course, as we will upon summary judgment, that

13

denying him that would be denying a discrete isolated

14

group of people the same protection of the law that the

15

citizenry at large has.

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. ELROD;

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. ELROD;

An equal protection clause —
Access of courts —
— violation?
— whether it be viewed as part of

20

equal protection or as an extension of freedom of

21

expression.

22

have access to court on Bivens-type claims.

23

apparently, government employees, if the lower court is

24

correct, so far as a class, as a discrete class, those

25

who have had the benefits of Civil Service remedies

Prisoners have access to court.

which come down on the bottom line to reinstatement and

2

back pay.

3

QUESTION;

Well, if a government -- a

4

government employee who was beat up or unreasonably

5

searched by FBI people would certainly have a Bivens

6

claim.

7
8

HR. ELROD;

Yes,

sir, he would, and he would

not be covered by any Civil Service act that I know of.

9

QUESTION;

No,

because the Civil Service

10

doesn’t purport to regulate -- the Civil Service doesn't

11

purport to regulate that relationship.

12

Service Act certainly can be argued, don’t you think, to

But the Civil

3

regulate the relationship between the government as

4

employer and its employees from the Pendleton Act on?

5

HR. ELROD;

That act — that argument has

6

certainly

7

applies in this case.

8

government as employer has been interested in civilian

9

employees since even before the adoption of the

20
21

surface

plausibility.

I am not sure that it

I am sure that there -- that the

Pendleton Act.
I think the government does have other

22

interests as an employer than it has -- from those that

23

it has in some other capacity.

24
25

I suggest to this Court -- I submit to this
Court that the Civil Service remedies which the

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

government postulates here as a bar to the maintenance

2

of a Bivens suit in the premises of this case do not

3

meet the test standard prescribed by this Court in

4

Carlson against Green, for as Justice O'Connor pointed

5

out, among other things, they afford no recompense

6

whatever with respect to the dignitary elements of the

7

petitioner's claim.

8

9

And we consider that interest in personality,
how it is shielded by the Bill of Rights.

And we would

10

consider the policy often enunciated by this Court, a

11

policy of maximizing the vindication of constitutional

12

rights.

13

QUESTION*

Kell, your position necessarily

14

means, I take it, that in unlawful discharges or

15

demotions or failure to get a promotion that was due,

16

the Civil Service remedy enacted by Congress is not the

17

exclusive remedy?

18
19

KR. ELROD*

It is unless it’s constitutional

deprivation bar.

20

QUESTION*

21

SR. ELROD*

Unless what?
Unless the promotion — the

22

advserse action, as they used to call it, I think we

23

call it unwarranted or unjustified now — unless the

24

adverse action is unconstitutional, the Bivens — there

25

is no Bivens remedy, of course.

The administrative

Bivens had nothing to do with an

the government, did it?

4

MR. ELRODs

5

QUESTIONS

Sir?
The Bivens remedy, as defined in

6

the Bivens case, was not a remedy for government

7

employees, was it?

8
9

MR. ELRODs

As — in the Bivens case it was a

remedy for Webster Bivens, who as the Court perceived,

10

or a majority of the Court, no other remedy that was

11

made.

12

as I perceive it, it was stated that Bivens established

13

that a citizen, the victim of an unconstitutional -- of

14

unconstitutional ieprivation had a right of action,

15

sounding and damages -- I am paraphrasing, of course —

16

against --

In Carlson against Green, which expanded Bivens,

QUESTION:

A citizen — a citizen who was not

an employee, however.

19

MR. ELROD;

Is that not true?
So far as I know, this is the —

20

the first employee case to reach this Court with a --

21

where a government employee was asserting a Bivens-type

22

claim.

23

QUESTION:

Well, he might — the government

24

employee might, as Justice Rehnguist suggests, have a

25

Bivens-type claim in some circumstances.

The question

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is whether he has a Bivens-type claim arising out of

2

government conduct or alleged government conduct for

3

which other remedies have been provided.

4

SR. ELROD:

Well, with some deference, I

5

suggest that I have failed adequately to state what we

6

are complaining about.

7

absolutely accurate on the basis of what I have said.

8

want to make it abundantly clear that what we complain

9

of is something that took place before the wheels of the

Your perception probably is

governmental machinery were engaged.
It is a tort antecedent to the engagement of

12

the wheels of that machinery.

13

place of power where the other -- in a place where the

14

— the tort feasors entering into the conspiracy would

15

otherwise not have any meaning unless he were in that

16

place of power.

It is a tort by one in

the malicious prosecution of administrative proceedings.

QUESTION:

We are complaining

Nr. Elrod, in the Bivens case,

23

following up on the Chief Justice's question, there was

24

no other remedy available to Bivens, was there?

25

KR. ELROD:

There — arguably, the New York

Well, how do you say this is a

The Bivens case didn’t have but one remedy.

11

MR. ELROD:

12

QUESTION:

13

NR. ELROD:

Well, in Carlson —
Your case has two remedies.
In Carlson, Mr. Justice Marshall,

14

in Carlson against Green, the first issue assumed that

15

the allegations of the complaint would support an action

16

under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

17

that, this Court held that the remedies were cumulative

18

and parallel and that the, as I -- as I perceive Green,

19

the ruling, and that the FTCA claim or remedy did not

20

bar a Bivens remedy.

21

22

QUESTION:

Well, why do you say it’s a

Bivens-type case?

ME. ELROD:

Well, Bivens is an extension of

Clifford Trust and Totten Trust and so forth.

5

taken on a generic secondary meaning.

directly under the Constitution without intervening

7

enactment by Congress authorizing the federal courts to

entertain such an action.

It's a Bivens type.

Mr. Elrod, I suppose one could say

10

that there are some advantages in going the Bivens

route, if you have it, over the administrative route.

administrative route over the Bivens route.

Eminently so, sir.

matter, I do not know why anybody other than a pioneer

or a Don Quixote.

22

QUESTION:

Now, did he recover some $30,000 in

back pay before he was reinstated?

At the time of his reinstatement

QUESTION:

And that amounted to some $30,000?

He has — his economic losses, while they

embrace the matter of attorney’s fees and of lost leave

QUESTIONS

On your theory, is it not true that

a great, great number of employee discharges or failures

10

to get promotions or tenure or whatever in government

11

might well be open to both the Civil Service remedy and

12

the remedy that you are seeking here?

13

many cases, the allegations — in 27 years I have seen

14

hundreds of them now in the federal courts — many, many

15

cases the allegation is that the boss was biased, that

16

the hearing board was not impartial, that somebody was

17

out to get him and that sort of thing.

18

add up to a Bivens tort claim, at least, too, would they

19

not ?

20

HE. ELROD:

On paper.

That is, in many,

All those would

Particularly since

21

Harlow against Nixon — or rather Fitzgerald against

22

Harlow, I should think that they would be rather easily

23

disposed of, if not on motion to dismiss, then by -- on

motion for summary judgment interposed by a government

25

lawyer at no expense to the defendant.

QUESTIO”;

Well, in 1883, if that was the year

2

when Congress created what we now call the Civil Service

3

System, was not the purpose of providing a remedy that

4

would be inexpensive and fair and not put him -- put the

5

employee to going into the courts?

6

HE. ELEOD;

I don't read anything in the

7

Pendleton Act that has anything to do with remedies.

8

may have misread it.

9

partially eliminated the spoils system, said that people

It created a merit system,

10

who habitually used too much alcohol couldn't be

11

employees, and created a Civil Service Commission.

12

then over the course of time we have the housekeeping

details gradually developing until we have some remedies

14

coming in with more to follow.

This alternative, this postulated remedy does

not make Mr. Bush whole, it does not deter like-minded

9

bureaucrats from doing by some other means what we aver

10

that Dr. Lucas did in this case.

11

QUESTIONS

Mr. Elrod, do you suppose Congress

12

could expressly adopt remedies saying that they intended

13

to provide a cause of action here that would be a

14

substitute for Bivens but a cause of action that would

15

not grant punitive damages or attorney's fees?

16

MR. ELRODs

17

QUESTIONS

18

MR. ELROD;

19

QUESTION;

20

Yes, ma'am.
Would that be all right?
I have to -So it isn't a constitutional

requirement thing that these remedies be provided.

21

MR. ELRODs

It's a constitutional requirement

22

that all litigant assemblies situated receive similar

23

treatment.

24
25

QUESTION;

So Congress couldn’t provide

something otherwise even if it expressly intended to do

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

3

so?
MR. ELROD;

It could limit it to government

employees, in my judgment.

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. ELROD;

6

QUESTION;

Congress could not —
Without some demonstration —
— expressly limit a remedy to

7

government employees, in your view, under the

8

Constitution ?

9

MR. ELRODi

Not -- and not in view of the

10

careful treatment which this Court has given similar

11

problems in such cases as CSC against Letter Carriers

12

and- in BMW against Mitchell where it has searched and

13

strained and required experiential empirical data to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, RESPONDENT

18
19

20

MR. GELLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;
The fundamental flaw in petitioner's position

21

is that it starts from the erroneous premise that a

22

cause of action for damages based on an alleged

23

constitutional violation is an essential ingredient of

24

the constitutional right itself.

25

Based on this faulty assumption which confuses

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

rights and remedias, petitioner asks as he did a moment

2

ago why should federal employees be deprived of this

3

right when state employees, for example, in a comparable

4

situation would be able to bring a personal damages

5

action in federal court.

6

And the answer is an obvious but nonetheless

7

extremely important one.

8

because Congress in Section 1983 has expressly

9

legislated a cause of action for damages.

10

State employees can bring suit

Now, Congress has not done so with respect to

11

federal employees such as petitioner.

12

has set up an elaborate and comprehensive administrative

13

mechanism, followed by judicial review, as a means of

14

remedying adverse personnel decisions in federal

15

employment, including personnel decisions alleged to be

16

based on some unconstitutional motivation.

17

Instead, Congress

Now, this administrative scheme can provide

18

adequate make-whole relief, and it represents the

19

product of literally a century's worth of careful

20

balancing of the rights of federal employees and the

21

demands of the federal employment relationship.

22

submit that it would be an unwarranted intrusion into an

23

area plainly reserved to Congress if this Court were to

24

create an additional damages remedy superimposed on top

25

of the remedy Congress has provided, absent any

And we

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

statutory authority to do so.
Now, this case is, of course, merely the

3

latest in a series of constitutional damages actions

4

that this Court has considered in the dozen years since

5

Bivens was decided.

6

the outset that this case is fundamentally different

7

from any of the prior cases.

8

itself because in Bivens Congress hadn’t addressed the

9

remedial question at all.

But it's important to realize at

This case is unlike Bivens

The argument made in Bivens

10

was that the claimant in that case should be relegated

11

to his remedies under state tort law.

12

And this case is also unlike Davis against

13

Passman because in Davis the claimant was expressly

14

included — excluded by Congress from a comprehensive

15

statutory remedial scheme and would have been left

16

entirely remedyless absent the Bivens action.

17

Finally, it is unlike Carlson against Green

18

because in Carlson Congress had set up a judicial remedy

19

that was not designed with constitutional violations in

20

mind and was plainly intended to serve as a complement

21

to rather than as a replacement for a Bivens remedy.

22

Now, in each of these cases, before allowing a

23

Bivens remedy, the court ensured that Congress either

24

had not addressed the question of what remedy to provide

25

or had addressed it in a way that was not intended to

20

occupy the field.

2

interstitially.

3

providing a remedy in a case properly within its

4

jurisdiction, but in a way that didn't frustrate

5

Congress' primary lawmaking power.

6

The court, in effect, was legislating
It was carrying out Congress' intent by

Now, the question here is very different.

7

Congress has provided an express statutory remedy.

8

remedy is in the Civil Service laws.

9

designed to deal with, among other things,

That

And it's expressly

10

constitutional violations of the kind alleged by

11

petitioner here.

12

comprehensive way that really leaves very little doubt

13

that that remedy is intended to be exclusive.

14

And Congress has done so in a

Se believe that Congress' intent should be

15

followed here as well as it was in Bivens, Davis, and

16

Carlson.

17

Now, the Court has organized uniquely into

18

Congress' intent in the past by essentially asking two

19

questions.*

20

remedy equally effective in the view of Congress?

21

Second, if there is no other available remedy, are there

22

nonetheless special factors counseling hesitation such

23

that Congress couldn't have intended the courts to

24

intrude into a particular area simply based on the power

25

of the jurisdictional ground?

First, does there exist another federal

1

2
3
4
5

And we believe that both questions lead to the
answer given by the Court of Appeals in this case.
QUESTION:

What ground did the Court of

Appeals go on?
MR. GELLER:

The Court of Appeals focused on

6

the -- on the second ground, the counseling hesitation,

7

although in the course of it it described the very

8

comprehensive Civil Service remedies that -- that the --

9

that federal employees have -- have available to it.

10

think the court might have done that on remand after

11

this Court decided Carlson against Green because there

12

was a statement in Carlson about requiring an explicit

13

statement by Congress.

14

QUESTION:

So they didn't — they didn't come

15

out with the ultimate conclusion that you suggest in

16

your first argument that Congress intended the remedy

17

provided to be exclusive?

18

I

MR. GELLER:

Well, they didn't in those terms,

19

Justice White, but both questions are really designed to

20

answer the same question, which is:

21

of Congress?

22
23
24
25

What is the intent

Did Congress intend the courts to —

QUESTION:

So you are just presenting one

ground, not —
MR. GELLER:

We rely on both grounds here,

although we think that the -- the way to analyze this

22
ALDEP.SON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case is to look and see as the court did in Bivens and

2

Davis and in Carlson whether there was some other

3

adequate remedy available to the claimant, and if there

4

is, and if Congress intended that remedy to be

5

exclusive, that's really the end of the judicial inquiry.

6

QUESTION;

Well, if we disagree with that, if

7

we didn't embrace the Court of Appeals’ rationale, you

8

nevertheless suggest we affirm on —

9

MR. GELLER:

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. GELLERs

Absolutely, yes.

We argue —

- — the ground you present?
Yes.

We argue both, we argue

12

both of these points below.

And as I say, there are

13

really separate ways of answering the same question,

14

which is;

15

What was Congress' intent?
Let me say that this is at bottom just a

16

federal employment dispute.

17

two-job grade demotion from GS-14 to GS-12 following a

18

disagreement with officials in his agency about internal

19

agency practices.

20

demoted for publicly making false and misleading

21

statements about his job that disrupted his agency's

22

activities and undermined employee morale.

23

Petitioner was given a

Now, his superiors claim he was

And petitioner claims on the other hand that

24

he was in fact demoted simply for justiably criticizing

25

his superiors.

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

This is the sort of dispute that in the

2

private sector would be resolved internally or by

3

contract or arbitration or something like that.

4

the federal employment sphere as well, the court has

5

been extremely deferential to the executive branch and

6

to Congress in settling these courts of -- these kinds

7

of internal employment disagreements.

8
9

find in

So even in the absence of any guidance by
Congress, we think that this is an area that counsels

10

hesitation in the implication of a Bivens remedy.

11

here we don't have congressional silence at all.

12

we have is an extremely elaborate, comprehensive,

13

adequate system of administrative and judicial remedies

14

that Congress has set up precisely to deal with the sort

15

of question that is raised in this case.

16

But
What

Aggrieved employees can challenge adverse

17

personnel actions, and including personnel actions

18

claimed to violate their constitutional rights.

19

can pursue -- pursue those remedies through two layers

20

of administrative review, followed by judicial review.

21

And if they eventually prevail, they are entitled to

22

complete make-whole relief.

They can get back pay, as

Bush did, reinstatement, restoration of all

The Congress clearly thought when it was

1

passing the Back. Pay Act, it was passing complete

2

perfecting legislation to make the employee whole.

3

this Court said much the same thing in Samson against

4

Murray and Arnett against Kennedy.

5

And

In fact, it’s guite peculiar in a sense that

6

the petitioners would argue that a Bivens action is more

7

effective than -- than what Congress has already

8

provided for someone who claims — whose claim is based

9

-- basically an employment dispute.

Someone who claims

10

he was demoted or fired, it would seem that any remedy

11

that didn’t include something like reinstatement would

12

be ineffective.

13

only effective remedy is a constitutional damages action.

14

And yet we’re told here today that the

Indeed, petitioner pursued these very remedies

15

ani, I said — as I said a moment ago, received

16

reinstatement, back pay, and restoration of all benefits.

17

Now, we submit that when Congress has spoken

18

as clearly as it has here, there is simply no room left

19

for the Court to legislate interstitially.

20

need for the Court to create a damages remedy to

21

vindicate constitutional rights, because Congress has

22

already announced the remedy it believes should be

23

applied in that situation.

an adequate one.

25

There is no

And that remedy is plainly

If the Court's statement in Bivens, Carlson

and Davis about Congress' ability to substitute for a

2

Bivens remedy with something that it believes to be

3

equally effective means anything, it has to mean that

I

»
Congress can do what it did in this case in the case of

)

federal employees.

6

And I think what the Court meant in Carlson

7

when it talked about an explicit statement, requiring

8

explicit statement by Congress, I don't think the Court

9

meant anything more than Congress had to be legislating

10

with the Constitution in mind, unlike, for example, in

11

Carlson against Green, where the claim was that a tort

12

claim remedy was a substitute for a Bivens action even

13

though Congress in passing that tort claims remedy

14

certainly wasn't legislating with the Constitution in

15

mind.

16

claims remedy to prove a constitutional violation, the

17

plaintiff had to mold his claim into the form of a

18

common law tort in order to recover.

19

In fact, it wasn't even enough under the tort

But here the Civil Service remedies are

20

clearly addressed to, among other things, constitutional

21

violations.

22

Civil Service laws, the Lloyd and Fallon Act, was passed

23

to prevent the sort, the same sort of adverse personnel

24

actions that petitioner Bush claims he suffered in this

25

case, where Congress was concerned that Presidents Taft

In fact, as we point out, one of the early

26

1

and Roosevelt had issued gag orders preventing executive

2

branch employees from — from complaining to Congress

3

about abuse or mismanagement in the Federal Government.

4

So we think that what Congress has done here

5

is in — it is to pass a remedy that certainly in its

6

view, and the Court said in Carlson against Green that

7

it has to be equally effective in the view of Congress,

8

not in the view of plaintiffs or even in the view of

9

this Court.

And we think that that is what they have

10

done here and that the Court of Appeals therefore

11

properly affirmed the dismissal of petitioner's

12

complaint for failure to state a cause of action

13

directly under the Constitution.

14

that judgment be affirmed.

And we would ask that

If there are no further questions?

MR. ELROD;

22

and careful collation of the legislative materials which

the government itself cites in this case will not

remedies for the type of grievance that Mr. Bush has
