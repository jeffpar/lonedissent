ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT Q. KEITH, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8

MR. CARUSO*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

9 please the Courts
10

The expanded city of Port Arthur, Texas,

11

constitutes a black population that amounts to 35

12

percent of the voting age population.

This expansion

13 occurred through a popular election and consolidation
14 with two adjoining suburban cities and the subsequent
15 annexation of an unincorporated area to the east of Port
16 Art hur.
17

Because of the expansion, the black population

18 in the city by 1980 census standards changed from a 45
19 percent black total population to a 40 percent black
20 total population.
21

The case was tried to the three-judge district

22 court in the District of Columbia on an election plan

23 that is not before the Court.

It was tried on what we

24 know in this record as a 4-4-1 election plan.

The city

25 was divided into four single-member districts of equal

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

size and a representative was to be elected from each of

2 those districts.

Then there was an at-large

3 representative to be elected from each of those four
4 districts.

So there were four single-member

5 representatives and four at-large representatives.
6

We tried the case.

The court approved the

7 expansion of the boundaries as being objectively
8 verifiable,

legitimate in purpose.

9 the question of the 4-4-1 plan,

We lost the case on

there's no question

10 about it.
11

When the district court opinion was rendered,

12 the court directed the city to detail the steps that it

13 would take to address the issue.

The city went to the

14 United States, to the Attorney General, and hammered out
15 an agreed election plan.

The parties then through joint

16 submission submitted that agreed election plan to the
17 district court.
18

It is that agreed election plan that is before

In this record we call that plan the

There are then — on the left side of town,

22 the two single-member districts are combined, and on the

23 east side of town the two single-member districts are
24 combined into two additional single-member districts.
25 Thus we have six single-member districts.

That's four

plus two

Then there are three at-large representatives.

3 One is the mayor, who may reside anywhere in the
4 community and be elected at large, and that is not in
5 dispute.

There are two at-large representatives, one of

6 whom must reside on the east and one of whom must reside

7 on the west.
In the joint submission made by the Attorney

8

9 General following a protracted trial, the parties stated
10

that the agreed plan provides the minority population

11

with representation reasonably equivalent to its

12 strength in

13 Richmond.

the expanded city, tracking verbatim
The Attorney General and the city agreed to

14 that.
15

Turning to Section 5 of the Act, there’s no

16 question the purpose was legitimate.

We were responding

17 to a directive of the court, and we worked with the
18 Attorney General.
19

There is no question that the effect of the

20 change was legitimate,
21

because, as the Attorney General

stated in the agreed submission, the single-member

22 districts in the city’s plan would appear to provide the

23 minority community with a fair opportunity to obtain
24 representation reasonably equivalent to their political
25 strength in the enlarged community, and cited Richmond.

1

The demographics of the single-member districts

2

are such that one district has, in round terms, an 81

3

percent black population, a second district has a 61

4

percent black population.

Then those two are combined

6 percent black population.

majority black population.

There are three

9 single-member districts that have a largely white
10

population.
But we went one step further in this case that

11

12 is a little unusual.
13

The Attorney General and the

parties, the city, agreed that in all probability

14 representation

would be provided equivalent to the

15 strength of the minority community.
The court, the district court and a court in

this 4-2-3 plan.

We conducted elections in

single-member districts and in the mayor's
That’s before Your Honors in the record.
In those elections which were conducted in

22 those six single-member districts there were three black
23 citizens elected from

the majority black districts and

24 there were three white citizens elected from the
25

majority white districts, thus, if you will, proving

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

categorically and undisputedly that the minority

2 community received representation reasonably equivalent

3 to its political strength in the expanded community.
4

The United States has argued very vigorously

5 the facts of the case as if the original plan that we
6 tried was before Your Honors.

7

The district court disapproved the 4-2-3 plan

8 notwithstanding the representation and agreement of the

9 Attorney General and the City of Port Arthur.

The

10

district court decision was two to one.

11

in rejecting the plan, stated that it did not

12

sufficiently neutralize the effects of expansion and

13 dilution.

That was the conclusion.

The majority,

There were no

14 reasons given.
15

QUESTION;

Mr. Keith, may I inquire whether you

16 think that the standard that we should use to measure, a
17 fair reflection of political strength of the blacks in
18 the expanded city, should be measured on the basis of
19 voting age population figures or on general population
20 figures?
21

MR. KEITHs

Your Honor, in footnote 22 of the

22 Rome decision the Court stated,

respectfully, a

23 preference for the voting age population.

And

24 frequently both the district court and this Court in
25 other cases have spoken of —

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

We haven't really determined that,

2 have we?

3

MB. KEITH;

4

QUESTION*

I think that's fair.
Is there anything in this record to

5 show whether the general population statistics are a
6 good indicator of future voting age population

7 statistics?
8

MB. KEITHs

The Attorney General's office and

9 the city and the court have all extrapolated this 35
10

percent number.

11

legitimate number and a preferable number if we —

12

We have all agreed that this is a

QUESTION;

You may have agreed to that, but is

13 there anything in the record to tell us whether there is
14 some correlation on future voting age population.
15

MR. KEITHs

No, Your Honor, there is not.

We

16 have accepted it as the best number available to the
17 Census Bureau and to the parties.
QUESTION;

18

Is it your position that we should

19 focus entirely on voting age population figures?
MR. KEITH;

20
21

Your Honor, it is my view that that

is the best standard if it is a legitimate, demonstrable

22 number.

Now, it is not always available.

23

QUESTION;

Does your argument rest on that

24 premise?
25

MR. KEITHs

Not at all, because if you take

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Justice Marshall's footnote in the Beer case and do the

2 mathematics — and these become mathematical cases —

3 our representation of 33 percent minority representation
4 on the councill and a 40 percent population, if you take
5 that ratio, that's identical to that which he suggested
6 was appropriate in the New Orleans -- in the Beer case

7 in New Orleans.
8

So we’re entirely comfortable with the 40

9 percent population, or we're entirely comfortable, of
10

course, with the 35 percent voting age population.

11

Either way, the position of the court is the same.
Now, Your Honors, in addition to the three

12

13 majority black seats, there is a representative elected
14 at-large from a district consisting of 71 percent black
15 citizens.

And as Justice Blackmun said in concurrence

16 in Mobile, the residency provides additional
17 cross-sectional view, or the residency requirement
18 provides additional cross-sectional view.
19

Furthermore, in addition to having these three

20 safe seats, if you will, the majority community also has
21

a full opportunity to participate in the election of the

22 two at-large representatives and the mayor.

So the

23 black community has an opportunity to participate in the
24 election of the majority of the council.

QOESTIONi

Now —

Refresh my recollection.

The

1

figures are 40 percent population and 35 percent voting

2 age.

3

Do we know the percentage of registered voters?
MS. KEITH:

4 the record.

No, sir, we do not.

That's not in

The way Texas records are kept, it's really

5 difficult.
6

QUESTION*

7

MR. KEITH:

I see.
There's no question but what the

8 City of Port Arthur met the Richmond standard,

and

9 unless that Richmond standard is to be be replaced by a
10

new rule to govern this and future Section 5 cases, then

11

the Court —

12

QUESTION*

Excuse me, Mr. Keith.

You said that

13 since the 4-3-2 plan was offered there’s been an
14 election under it with seven, three black, three white,
15 and the mayor.
16

MS. KEITH:

17

QUESTION*

18

MS. KEITH*

Yes, sir.
What about the other two?
Those were the two at-large seats

19 which were still at issue in this case.
20

QUESTION*

21

MR. KEITH*

I see.
The district court said by way of

22 suggestion, we will approve your plan if you would allow

23 the at-large representatives by plurality.

And as a

24 result. Your Honor, there was no election conducted in
25 those two at-large seats.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

And is that the only issue that we

2 have up here, is the district court's insistence on the
3

plu rality?
MR. KEITH;

4

The real issue, Your Honor, is

5

whether or not the legislative plan meets the test of

6

Richmond.

7

before the Court.

The district court’s suggestion is really not

rule?
MR. KEITH;

The district court ruled two to one

that it did not and that we should go one more step.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. KEITH:

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. KEITH;

19

And what did the district court

plurality.

But only because.

Only because —

Only because -— of the plurality.
It didn't say because of the

It said because we did not sufficiently

20 neutralize the dilution.
21

QUESTION;

Yes, but they said if you didn't

22 have this head to head majority vote business you would
23
24
25

have neutralized it.
MR. KEITH:

That is correct. Your Honor.

And

the United States then says that because of your history

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of polarized voting and because of the past

2 discrimination which they argue, thus these past acts go

3 to infect those two at-large seats with the majority
4 vote.
5

QUESTION*

Well, is there any issue about

6 purpose in this plan, this particular plan?

HR. KEITH*

It was presented

in concert with the Attorney General and responsive to

9 the court.
10 purpose.
11

No, Your Honor.

Nobody suggested there’s an impermissible
We thought the case had been settled when we

received this rejection.
QUESTION*

12

So in terms of the Voting Rights

13 Act, what the court said is that this will have an
14 effect.
15

HR. KEITH:

16

QUESTION*

That is correct.
This will have an effect of diluting

17 minority voting rights.
18

HR. KEITH*

Yes, sir, by reducing the black

19 population from 45 to 40 percent there was dilution,
20 because there was a history of polarized voting and
21

because there was, by the court's findings, a

22 discriminatory effect in the past at-large elections.

23

QUESTION*

Well, prior plans they found had

24 been purposefully discriminatory.
25

MR. KEITH*

That's correct. Your Honor.

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1
2

QUESTION;

I mean, the case you lost, was lost

on purpose, wasn't it?

3

MR. KEITH;

4

QUESTION;

On purpose and effect.
Yes, but they never would have

5 needed to have gotten to effect.
MR. KEITH;

6

That's correct.

But most of the

7 opinion was related to effect.
Now, the question is, the district court tried

8

9 to look, at each of these individual parts and analyze
10

them, and the United States tries to have the Court

11

focus on each individual part and determine whether or

12 not it,

standing alone, passes muster.

In fact, as this

13 Court has insisted and as other courts dealing with this
14 have done, you look at the entire plan to determine
15 whether or not it has the effect.
16

QUESTION;

Mr. Keith, do I understand that if

17 you had accepted the plurality suggested by the district
18 court, the district court would have approved the 4-3-2
19 plan?
20

MR. KEITH;

21

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
And you refused to accept the

22 plurality suggestion?

23

MR. KEITH;

Yes, sir.

It was the legislative

24 judgment that the plurality was unacceptable.

Your

25 Honor, since that time and pursuant to the authority of

QUESTIONS

Rejected by whom, the voters at

7 large?
8

MB. KEITHs

9

Now, this is very clearly a legislative plan.

Yes, sir.

10

As late as April of this year, in the Upham v. Seman

11

case out of Texas, Your Honors reiterated the deference

12

that is given to the legislative plan, the policy

13 reasons that support it, the fact that neither the
14 Congress nor the Court is seeking to intrude into the
15 affairs of local government.
16

The Attorney General approved it after, by this

17 record, 12 settlement conferences prior to trial,
18 detailed depositions, a lengthy trial, briefs.

The

19 Attorney General is the constituted champion of a
20 minority voter, as was said in the Carey case.
21

The

Attorney General even in this proceeding has

22 acknowledged that the court could properly have approved

23 the 4-2-3 plan.
24

It is the position of the city that the

25 Richmond standard is a clear, direct, legitimately

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

predictable standard that both the courts and parties

2 across the country are able to deal with.

Once that

3 standard is met, the statute is complied with and the
4 district court is obligated under this Court’s decisions
5 to approve it.
6

QUESTION*

7 procedure?

May I ask you a question of

I wonder why you and your adversaries in the

8 litigation didn’t simply dismiss the lawsuit,

9 voluntarily go in and ask this case be dismissed.
10

11
12

MR. KEITH*

We considered that, Your Honor.

But we had all invoked the jurisdiction of the court.
QUESTION*

Does that not imply, then, that the

13 court had some power to approve or disapprove of the
14 appropriate remedy?
15

MR. KEITH*

Your Honor, the court had the

16 jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter,
17 there’s no question of that.
18

QUESTION*

Do you think it was required as a

19 matter of law — they had absolutely no discretion in
20 the matter -- to accept anything that was acceptable to
21

22

the Attorney General?
MR. KEITH:

So long as there were objectively

23 verifiable facts and there was no collusion or nothing
24 impermissible, and the facts undisputedly met the test.
25 And that is true in this case.

This is not a Rule 52,

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

where you've got clearly erroneous or abuse of

2 discretion.

As a matter of undisputed facts, the

3 governing facts are established; it becomes purely a
4 guestion of law.
5

QUESTIONS

Well, you did have intervenors

6 below, did you not?

7

HR. KEITHs

Yes, sir, we did.

We had two — we

8 had four persons who intervened on behalf of the

9 Defendant.

Two of them approved the 4-2-3 plan, two of

10 them objected to the 4-2-3.

QUESTION:

11

Well, doesn't the fact that

12 intervenors are permitted in a proceeding like

this

13 suggest that they may be able to urge arguments that may
14 not appeal to the Government and still might commend
15 themselves to the court?
16

MR. KEITHs

Yes, sir, that's correct.

But that

17 does not mean that their arguments reach the level of a
18 proposition as a matter of law.
19

QUESTION:

No, no.

20

QUESTION:

If the Attorney General — you

21

didn't have to deal with the Attorney General to go to

22 court.

23

HR. KEITHs

24

QUESTION:

25 all.

That's correct, Your Honor.
You didn't have to deal with him at

And if the Attorney General hadn't been in this

1

suit or hadn't been participating in this thing at all,

2 and you lost the first lawsuit and then you proposed
3

another plan, wouldn't the court have the -- certainly

4

it would have the authority to disapprove your 4-4-3 --

5

or your latest plan, wouldn't it?

6

MR. KEITHs

7

QUESTION;

No question of that, Your Honor.
Well, you think it loses its

8 authority just because the Attorney General comes in and

9 proposes it?
10

MR. KEITHs

11

QUESTION:

No, sir, we do not.
Especially if the Attorney General

12

still keeps a string on it and says, we've still got

13

worries about the plan.
MR. KEITHs

14

But Your Honor, where the court

15

lost its authority was where the facts become undisputed

16

and when undisputedly the plan meets the test of

17

Richmond.
The Attorney General also. Your Honor, is more

18
19

than just the ordinary litigant in a voting rights

20 proceeding.
21

He under the Act has a standing essentially

equivalent to that of a court in the administration of

22 this Act.
23

QUESTION;

Mr. Keith, let's assume for the

24

moment that the Court were to disagree with you that the

25

agreement of the Attorney General required the court to

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

aprove the plan.

2 moment.

Let's disregard that argument for a

Then is it still your position that the court

3

as a matter of lav under the City of Richmond had to

4

approve the plan that was submitted?

5

MR. KEITH;

Yes, Your Honor.

And I do not say

6 the court -7

2rJESTIDN;

And why?

Do you think the court had

8 the right to look into discriminatory purpose?
9

Did the

court have the right to look beyond the effect of the

10

plan, into purpose?

11

MR. KEITH;

Yes, Your Honor, it did.

But

12

there's no suggestion of impermissible purpose here, and

13

this case should not be reversed because the Attorney

14

General agreed.

15

the plan unequivocally meets a clear, direct standard

16

established by this Court.
QUESTION;

17
18

This case should be reversed because

And if all we're looking at is that,

then do we apply the clearly erroneous standard?
MR. KEITH;

19

No, Your Honor, because the facts

20 are fixed as a matter of law and then the question of
21

whether it does or does not becomes a question of law

22 and not a question of fact or discretion.

It is a

23

clear, predictable standard and the parties have met

24

it.

25

evidence of that.

The Attorney General's agreement is merely further

1

QUESTION*

Has there been a trial on the

2 question whether the 4-2-3 plan satisfies the Richmond

3 standard?
4

MR. KEITH;

5

QUESTION*

No, Your Honor, there has not.
And is it at least not theoretically

6 possible that there was some invidious purpose in the

7 adoption of this plan rather than some possible
8 alternative?
9

MR. KEITH*

There is, but there's no suggestion

10

of it at any time or place.

11

QUESTION*

But I'm just wondering, how can you

MR. KEITH;

No, sir.

And the court made no

impermissible.

Hell, let me put it this way.

25 plurality requirement, and you had said, well, we don't

You’d make the same argument you make

M3. KEITH:

QUESTION*

That is correct, yes, sir.
So that the Attorney General’s

5 consent is really irrelevant to the .issue before us.
MR. KEITH*

6

It is persuasive.

It is not

7 controlling.
QUESTION*

8

But the controlling fact again is

9 that the record leaves no room for doubt on the question

standard.

point.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEES

18

Mr. Phillips.

MR. PHILLIPS*

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

19 the Court:
20
21

The issue in this case involving Section 5 of
the Voting Rights Act is whether the district court

22 erred in refusing to preclear the City of Port Arthur’s

23 post-annexation electoral plan so long as the city
24 insisted on including a majority vote requirement for
25 the election at large of two members of the city

2

council
In the view of the Government, the issue is an

3 exceedingly narrow one.

There is no dispute that the

4 annexations of Lakeview, Pear Ridge, and Sabine Pass are
5 subject to the requirements of Section 5 of the Voting
6 Rights Act.

7
8

There is no dispute that the effect of those
annexations is to significantly dilute the minority

9 voting strength in the City of Port Arthur, in the
10

expanded City of Port Arthur.

Indeed, there is some

11

reason to suspect, from the findings of the district

12 court with regard to the 4-4-1 plan, that the

13 motivation, at least in part, for the expansion of the
14 City of Port Arthur was to assure that the white
15 majority retained its status as the majority for the
16 foreseeable future.
17

Thus we are all in agreement that the basic

18 test to be satisfied is that announced by the Court in
19 the City of Richmond decision.
20
21

22

QUESTION*

Hr. Phillips, why doesn’t the Beer

case control this case?
MR. PHILLIPS;

Hell, largely because the Beer

23 case deals with a situation where there’s simply a
24 change in an electoral practice dealing with a
25 pre-existing city and that city remains as it is,

21

whereas

2

QUESTION*

There's nothing in Beer that limits

3

it to that or says that it isn't applicable to

4

annexations.

5

NR. PHILLIPS*

No, clearly not.

But this

6

Court's decision in City of Richmond seems to indicate,

7

or at least imply, and again in the City of Rome, that

8 the proper test is not an analysis of retrogression, but
9

rather the dilution of the minority vote comes from the

10

annexation in the first instance.

11

is that the minority community be adequately represented

12

in the post-annexation city.
QUESTION*

13
14

And the requirement

City of Richmond antedated Beer, did

it not?

15

SR. PHILLIPS*

16

In the city's view, this Court's decision in

17

City of Richmond imposes a bright-line test measuring

18

the propriety of the city's post-annexation electoral

19

plan.

In our view, that simply does not square with the

20 language of the test.
21

Yes, sir.

The test looks for whether or not

there is fair or reasonable representation.

22 terms, it is not a bright-line test.

But its

It requires the

exercise of judgment by the tryer of fact and by the

Indeed, given the variable types of plans that

of a bright-line test.

QUESTION :

Mr. Phillips —

11

MB. PHILLIPS:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

— have you taken into

13

consideration, there is a difference between the way

14

land is annexed in Texas and the way land is annexed in

15

Virginia?

16

question is, does that have any bearing on this?
MR. PHILLIPS:

17
18

They're entirely different, aren't they?

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

so.

Both sides in this case complain that the other

19

20 has failed to look at the plan in its entirety.
21

The

Our

submission is that the city is the party with tunnel

22 vision.

Specifically, the city looks at the single

23

member district portions of this plan, finds that they

24

will provide a certain amount of representation, and

25

then completely ignores the rest of the plan.

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Our position is that admittedly the single

2 member district aspects of this plan go a long way

3 toward satisfying the Voting Rights Act.
4

QUESTIONS

Is this a late insight on the behalf

5 of the Attorney General?
6 the plan as submitted,

7

HR. PHILLIPS!

If the court had just approved

would you have been up here?
No, Your Honor, we would not

8 have been up here under those circumstances.

9 position is that it was a close question.
10 joint submission

11

Our

I think our

to the district court makes it clear we

believe it is a close question.

12

The district court viewed the facts somewhat

13 differently from the way we viewed the facts and drew
14 different inferences from them and concluded on balance
15 that the 4-2-3 plan with the majority vote requirement
16 could not guarantee adequate representation to the
17 minority.
18

QUESTION!

And now you agree with that?

19

HR. PHILLIPS:

And that judgment we believe is

20 entitled to respect.

QUESTION!

21
22 its

Hell, you seem to be agreeing with

not just entitled to respect.

You think it is now

23 right.
24

HR. PHILLIPS:

Hell, because it is based on a

25 set of findings that we believe are not clearly

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

erroneous, ani on:e you accept those findings, viewed

2 through the prism of the district court's July 14th

3 order, it seems to me there is no other conclusion
4 that's available at this point.
5

Specifically, there are four facts that we

6 regard, that the district court found, that we think

7 control this cases
First, the City of Port Arthur faces severe

8

9 racial block voting.
10 case is one
11

The statistic that's used in this

that demonstrates statistically significant

polarization at the .5 or .6 level, .5 or .6.

12 just prior to the annexation in

Elections

this case involved

13 racial polarization at .8 and above.

Accordingly, it is

14 clear that this is a badly divided city on the basis of
15 race.
16

An even more important finding in our view is

17 the district court's conclusions that with at-large
18 seats and a majority vote election the black community
19 has no opportunity to influence any elections at large.
20 That is, even white versus white candidates, the black
21

community is unable — has no more than a mere

22 theoretical possibility of exercising a swing vote

23 influence.

Accordingly, the ultimate effect of this

24 plan as viewed from the district court's perspective
25 must be to discard the black community or eliminate the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

black community's influence over six of the nine seats

2 of the city council.
3

Third, the district court found that in the

4

past when there is a majority white population

5

controlling the politics in the City of Port Arthur,

6

there is a pervasive and systematic disregard for the

7

black community, a systematic disregard that we submit,

8 the court would conclude, will continue into the future
9

unless this plan is modified.

10

Finally —

11

QUESTION*

Mr. Phillips, do we know what the

12

district court based its decision on?

13

entirely clear.

14

court thought it was reviewing the expansion, when it

15

refers to neutralizing the expansion.

16

theoretically, you would determine separately whether

17

the expansion were something that could be approved, and

18

then if that can be approved you would determine whether

19

the voting plan could be approved.

Because it isn't

It almost reads as though the district

20

Is there some confusion there?

21

MB. PHILLIPS;

And

Nell, I doi’t think so.

I agree

22 that the order is not artfully drafted, but it seems to
23

me that the district court made clear its understanding

24

of the two strands of analysis required by the City of

25

Richmond test.

And it had already approved the

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

annexation, and all that was left was the adequacy of

2 the voting plan adopted for the expanded city.
3

QUESTION:

So you think notwithstanding the

4

language that the court used, that there was no

5

confusion about what the court was doing?
HR. PHILLIPS:

6
7

I don't perceive that any of the

litigants disagree with regard to what the effect of the

8 district court's order was and what it was intended to
9

be.
QUESTION:

10

May I ask you also whether it's your

11

position that the Court should look only at voting age

12

population figures?
MR. PHILLIPS:

13

No, Your Honor.

In our brief we

14

argue that we think that both data have a legitimate

15

role to inform the judgment of the Court.

16

voting age population suggests the immediate effect of a

17

change, but it does seem to us that raw population —
QUESTION:

18
19

Admittedly,

Do you think it's error if the Court

looks only at voting age population figures?

Would that

20 be error?
21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

If it's error?

Wrong?

Could a decision stand that

focuses only on that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Wall, the purpose of the Voting

Rights Act and the approval of these changes is to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

determine their future effect, and I would think it

2 would raise serious question if you completely

3 disregarded what might be the potential effect.
4 Assuming the voting age population
5

is gust significantly

different from the overall population, it might create a

6 problem.

In a case like this, where the difference is

7 not that significant,

it would be hard to imagine that

8 it would be very difficult.
9

The fourth finding that we think is significant

10 from the district court's June
11

12th opinion is its

conclusion that residency districts do not offer the

12 black community any greater influence over
13 districts,

because of the pockets of white influence in

14 the black districts
15 white candidates,

and accordingly the availability of

who in at-large elections will

16 continue to maintain the domination of

Arthur.

Based on these findings, we believe that the

19 district court-could conclude,

legimately conclude in

20 the exercise of its equitable judgment, that this plan
21

does not satisfy the Voting Rights Act, and that a

22 single minor modification would be required, should be
23 required in
24 influence in
25

order to assure that blacks will have
the future in these elections.

That modification is the elimination of the

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

majority vote requirement.

That elimination in no way

3

additional seats.

4

have influence over the elected officials from those

5

districts in the at-large elections, and that we think

It merely grants them the right to

6 is an appropriate exercise.
7

QUESTIONS

Were you suggesting that in an

8 election at-large that a city with a third of its voters
9

black, that they would have no influence, that neither

10

candidate would pay any attention to obtaining their

11

vote ?

12

MS. PHILLIPS;

The finding of fact by the

13

district court in its June 12 opinion is exactly to that

14

effect, that in only one or two elections in the 14

15

years prior to 1977 could it find any evidence to

16

indicate that there might have been a swing vote

17

influence.

today?
MR. PHILLIPS;

20
21

Is that typical across the South

Hoaor.

Well, I would hope not. Your

I'n not an expert on that and I would guess that

22 it's not always the case.

Certainly, City of Rome, the

23

district court found that in that community blacks had

24

exercised significant influence.

25

That's part of the reason why we believe our

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

submission in this case is a very narrow one.

We think

2 the City of Port Arthur is an unusual situation, based
3

on the findings of the district court.

4

we have to look beyond simply whether rough proportional

5

representation that's provided from the three single

Is it the position of the Government

that a majority vote is never appropriate?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Your Honor, not at all.

Certainly in a situation —

12

QUESTION:

13
14

It's the ggeneral rule across the

United States, isn't it?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it is.

And the city has argued in its reply brief that our

16

position is a par se rejection of that view.

QUESTION:

And may I get clear, is purpose

still in this case at this level?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Not in terms of the submission

20 to this Court, no, Your Honor.
21

QUESTION:

So we consider only the effect?

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I don't

23

believe that the district court's opinion or order can

24

fairly be read to cast any doubt on the purpose of the

25

plan as adopted.

If we reverse, if we reversed the

there be anything left of the case?
MR. PHILLIPS*

Well, I don't think the United

left to litigate, although the intervenors might take a

a

view different from that at this point.

11

QUESTION*

At least, the district court didn't

expressly negative any purpose —
MR. PHILLIPS*

No, the district court

indicate rather clearly that if the city were prepared

would be satisfactory.

MR. PHILLIPS*

Well, not actually, not as a

matter of logic I don't think. Your Honor.

Our position

22 is that the case, the facts of this case are not
23

significantly different, and if anything are easily

24

controlled by this Court's prior decisions in both City

25

of Richmond and City of Rome.

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

City of Richmond, the black community was

2 entitled on the basis of the single member districts to

3 have essentially four representatives and a serious
4 swing vote influence in a fifth district out of nine,
5 and that for a population of approximately 41 percent.
6 City of Rome involved an all at-large plurality vote

7 system that was characterized by the district court
8

itself as an essentially fair one, and yet the district

9 court felt compelled to remove the single residency
10 requirement
11

in that case, and this Court upheld that

exercise of judgment.

12

We believe that these facts suggest a much

13 worse situation for the black community and that the
14 district court's judgment in eliminating the largest
15 impediment to the opportunity to influence the city
16 council is a reasonable judgment by the district court
17 and should be affirmed.
18

If there are no further questions —

19

QUESTION:

May I ask you one question which

20

perhaps isn’t directly before us, but I'm curious

21

about.

The district court's opinion indicated that the

22 original annexation was infected with an invidious

23 purpose, as I recall the opinion.

And nevertheless, it

24 found that there were subsequent legitimate reasons for
25 the annexation that overcome the original invidious

purpose.

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Do you think that holding is

consistent with this Court’s holding in Rogers against

5

Lucas last year?
MR. PHILLIPS:

of that.

It is -- I hadn’t really thought

It is clearly consistent with this Court’s

8 holding in City of Richmond.

QUESTION:

9

Do you think it's consistent with

10

the Voting Rights Ret to have a mixed motive for a

11

change?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Your Honor, because the

13

problem is that annexations create unusual problems and

14

therefore you sort of have to examine them as a unique

situation, I think.

MR. KEITH:

Mr. Justice Stevens, in the very

page 4A of the opinion:

"He are convinced that the

Now, they did cast some doubt

on it, but they clearly came out on page 1 with an

As the

25 very plain that it was at their insistence and did

Justice Rehnquist asked about Beer.

Your

3 Honor, before these annexations began there was one
4 black representative among seven on the council.

Even

5 just voting on a partial council, there are now three
6 black representatives out of nine.

So if Beer becomes

7 the test, we have met Beer at least twice over.
8

Regardless of the effect of the swing vote, the

9 black community still has three representatives in a
10 nine-person council.

It has 35 percent of the voting

11 age population.
12

The Richmond standard is clear and direct and

13 does not invoke a lot of confusion, doubt, and
14 subjective judgments, that apparently would flow from an
15 affirmance of this district court decision.
