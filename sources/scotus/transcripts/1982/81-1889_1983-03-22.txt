ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME M. FEIT, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. FEIT;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court.
This case poses a question of the statutory

11

12

construction, whether Congress in the Natural Gas Policy

13

Act of 1978 meant that natural gas produced by a

14

pipeline is automatically entitled to the incentive

15

pricing scheme under Title I of that Act.

16

as here, the gas is old gas long dedicated to the

17

interstate market.

Even though,

In our view, the Court in holding that the

18
19

first sale prices and that the pricing scheme of Title I

20

applied to this pipeline produced gas misconceived the

21

legislative intent and argued, granted a profit to which

22

the pipeline were not entitled, $200 million

23

prospectively and something over $2 billion total

projected.

— it functions like an independent producer.

On the other hand, as the Court will recall,

10
11

it was not until 1954, when the Phillips case was

decided, that the independent producer was deemed to be

a natural gas company covered by the Act, by the Natural

14

Gas Act.

10

pipeline who sold at the wellhead was given this

11

economic risk establishment, was also treated as an

12

independent producer would be, that you have that kind

13

of development.

14

At the same time, as the years went on,

starting in

17

gas — all of that pre-'69 cost based gas was on

19

pipeline to be on parity, giving parity pricing to the

20

independent producer, wellhead pricing, and to the

So you have at the time of the enactment of

8

the Natural Gas Policy Act, that development coupled

9

with the development that the result of the decision in

10

the Phillips case had lead to an interstate regulated

11

market and an intrastate unregulated market with regard

12

to independent producer sales or sales like independent

13

producers.

14

The consequence was that the market

16

bifurcated.

16

shopping the market place as to his new wells, would

17

prefer to sell it in the intrastate market, which he did

18

— or which the producers generally did.

19

consequences were there was less gas in the interstate

market, more gas in the intrastate market, and high

priced gas.

Now I would like, with that background, to

turn to the statutory language.

Statutory language is

The critical provision, however,

And the certain sales not included -- and I’d

10
11

like to — I think this is essential to point to the

12

Court — that it shall not include the sale of any

13

volume of natural gas by any interstate pipeline,

14

intrastate pipeline, or local distribution company, or

15

any affiliate thereof -- and now the critical language

16

-- unless such sale is attributable to volumes of

17

natural gas produced by the pipeline, the interstate

pipeline, or the local distribution company, or the

affiliate.

We think that this interpretation flies in the

3

face of the statute.

printed at page 2 of our brief, makes it clear that the

5

term "sale" means a transfer for value.

Section 2(20), which is also

There is no

More significantly, or equally significantly,
there’s no contract.

There’s no relationship which

10

traditionally has been the basis of regulation by this

11

commission -- by the FESC -- under the Natural Gas Act.

12

The Mobil Sierra doctrine, as this Court will recall,

makes it clear that the contract to the parties are the

basis for the relationship.

The same principle attaches quite clearly

interpretation by the Court of Appeals cannot withstand

by several of the petitioners.

There’s another interpretation

QUESTION;

Before you leave that

interpretation, am I correct in recalling that if the

3

pipeline had a subsidiary instead of a single corporate

4

entity that transferred from its wholly-owned production

5

subsidiary to its transmission subsidiary, that you

6

would regard that as a sale?

7

MR. FEIT;

8

Let

me say this, Mr. Justice —

9
10

I would regard that as a sale.

QUESTION;

Unless they do exactly the same

bookkeeping for a division.

11

MR. FEITi

No, but there's a difference.

12

QUESTION;

What is the difference?

MR. FEIT;

The difference is that the

Conceptually the affiliate

The problem that you point to in terms of

21

perhaps intra-corporate, it's the same thing.

The

22

statute has an affiliate entities limitations which

23

makes it clear that where an affiliate producer sells to

24

his affiliated pipeline he must sell at the comparable

25

price soli by an independent producer.

Now, historically, it’s not clear in the *50's

QUESTION:

I can understand the statutory

of —

14

difference, but as a matter of economics or ordinary

15

business and investment and all the rest, why couldn't

16

you have your division doing the same kind of operating

17

that a subsidiary would.

18

MR. FEIT:

I guess you could have that, but

19

two answers.

One, the statutory scheme does not talk

20

about that kind of intra-corporate transfer.

21

production -- affiliate — production affiliates notes

22

contracts and on the face of it, of the statute, it

23

seems to us that there is a clear statutory

distinction.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

the commission has given parity pricing to mixed system

2

supply sales by a pipeline, but that's not a matter of

3

statutory interpretation.

4

interpretation based on our view that Congress left to

5

the commission the task of harmonizing the Natural Gas

6

Act with the Natural Gas Policy.

7

QUESTIONS

That's a matter of agency

Would you say the statutory

8

language is so clear that if the commission had adopted

9

the same construction as the Fifth Circuit had adopted

10

11

that would have been impermissable?
MR. FEIT;

No, on the contrary.

I, we do not

12

take the position that the statutory language -- it

13

doesn’t leap from the page.

14

the statutory language has to be read in the context of

15

the legislative background coupled with the deference if

16

there -- the rule as I understand it clearly is if there

17

are two possible interpretations and the commission or

18

the regulatory agency's interpretation is a rationally

19

based interpretation.

20
21

22
23

QUESTIONS

I think it quite clearly —

So you would say that the

commission rationally could have read it either way?
MR. FEITs

Yes, and I say that the Court of

Appeals didn't give us deference.

24

QUESTIONS

I understand.

25

MR. FEITs

Because it said that we had no

But, yes.

I — let me turn a bit to what we

view the legislative history to mean it to say.

The Court of Appeals -- the central assumption

5

of the Court of Appeals — they thought that there

fallacy in terms of the statutory scheme.

it reads the background of the history, it's clear that

seem to cover — cover pipeline produced gas.

Congress

The history is

The Senate bill purported

It had an affiliate entities rule which

On the other hand, the House bill -- the House

20
21

bill clearly was aimed at what they called the 1954

22

decision.

23

throughout the history of the debates for over two years

24

did any pipeline that I could find in the history say,

25

oh, yes, we're entitled to this price.

Hell, the 1954 decision was Phillips.

Nor

That view --

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

that view, in our judgement, was the one that Congress

2

enacted in the Natural Gas Policy Act.

statutory construction approach which meant to deal with

the problem, the problem of Phillips.

The bifurcation was a producing problem.

12

Whether the producer was the independent producer or, in

13

fact, the pipeline who sold at the wellhead.

14

might point out in that regard that pipeline — our

15

figures indicate that pipeline production is about 5.,

16

5.1 percent of the total production, so that we're

17

dealing with an independent producer statute which says

18

only those whether they be affiliates, whether they be

19

pipelines who perform functionally and economically as

20

the independent producer, are entitled to the

21

independent producer pricing.

QUESTION:

Is it your submission that an

does not do so through a subsidiary is not entitled to

MR. FEIT;

QUESTION*

So there's never a first sale —

4

MR. FEIT;

It's not first sale, first, because

2

y es .

as — the statute language doesn't compel it.

6

a first sale because -- as a matter of fact we think it

7

points the other way.

9

QUESTION;

It's not

But, is the purpose of the Acts

served by your position?

10

MR. FEIT;

That's precisely our point.

We

11

think the purpose of the Act was to meet the Phillips

12

problem.

13

Court of Appeals was its assumption that this was an

14

entitlement.

15

legislative doctrine that because you're meeting the

16

problems of independent producing production by — to

17

avoid the bifurcated market that at the same time — and

18

this seems to be the argument -- at the same time while

19

we pipelines, we're entitled to it, too.

20

We think the error, the fatal error in the

I mean because — it seems to me a strange

It seems to me there had to be a basic reason

21

why pipeline production other than wellhead sale

22

production -- wellhead sale was intended by Congress.

23

In that — in that regard the commission left -- we, the

24

NGPA, as leaving to the commission the problem of

25

harmonizing the Natural Gas Act with the Natural Gas

2

the commission have — has set up a basis of attributing

3

pricing similar to our independent producer production.

4

And I -- my —

In that harmonization we have — that is

5

QUESTIONS

May I follow that up a little bit?

6

If 25 percent of all the natural gas in the

7

United States were produced by interstate pipeline

8

companies, would you take a different view?

9

MR. FEITs

10

sold and how the impact is —

11

QUESTIONS

12
13

I would have to see how that gas is

If it were sold the same way as the

gas before the bill —
MR. FEITs

I think the logic of my position

14

would be that the basic purpose of the statute was to

15

overrule Phillips and that we would read the statute as

16

not covering that gas unless it could be shown that that

17

gas production had a very substantial impact on the

18

bifurcated market.

19

QUESTIONf

But would it not — would it not

20

have a substantial impact on the extent to which gas is

21

produced in the United States?

22

MR. FEITs

Yes, it would.

23

Let me just make my point — I repeat, the

24

critical consideration is a contract — a contractural

25

relationship.

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

For example, in your situation there would be

2

no contract, so the pipeline could get the highest

3

maximum lawful price while the independent producer who

4

was operating pursuant to a contract would get a lesser

5

amount.
QUESTION:

6

But if the country has a shortage

7

of natural gas, it seems to me, your position is awfully

8

technical.

9

MR. FEIT:

Awfully -- I'm sorry.

10

QUESTION:

Awfully technical.

MR. FEIT:

It wasn’t --

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES D. MCKINNEY, JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

10

MR. MCKINNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court.
This case is far less complicated than Mr.

11

Feit would suggest.

12

case is simply whether Congress intended to include or

13

to exclude natural gas produced by pipelines and

14

distribution companies from the coverage of the Natural

15

Gas Policy Act of 1978.

18

Simply stated, the question in this

Now, Mr. Feit spent a great deal of time at

17

the beginning of his argument talking about the Natural

18

Gas Act of 1938, and that just isn’t relevant to this

19

proceeding.

20

interpreting what Congress intended to do in the Natural

21

Gas Policy Act and this Court itself on January nth of

22

this year found, in the Energy Reserves case, that for

23

gas sold in the interstate market the Natural Gas Policy

24

Act replaced the federal price controls that had been

25

established under the Natural Gas Act.

What we’re concerned with here is

Mow petitioners argue that the Congress

pipelines and distributors from the coverage of the

Act.

determination, could not justify an interpretation that

9

basis whatever for disturbing that decision.

10

The Court of Appeals unanimously disagreed.

It

And there is no

In support of their position, the petitioners

11

argue that Congress generally could not have intended to

12

include pipeline production because this would be

13

inconsistent with commission cost-of-service regulation

14

for certain periods when the commission regulated

15

production under the Natural Gas Act.

16

that the Court of Appeals erred, therefore, in not

17

deferring to their interpretation and that the Court of

18

Appeals decision would create a substantial reworking of

19

state and federal regulatory schemes and that the

20

pipelines would reap a windfall.

21

They also argue

Now, in examining these arguments, the

22

starting point is not the Natural Gas Act of 1938.

23

starting point is to recognize the reasons leading to

24

the passage of the Natural Gas Policy Act and the

25

structure of the pricing provisions that Congress

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

The

1

created to deal with the problem it was confronted with

2

in 1978.

3

The Act was passed because of shortages that

4

had developed in the interstate market in the 1970's

5

that had resulted from commission regulation under the

6

Natural Gas Act.

7

It had two fundamental purposes.

The first purpose was to eliminate the

8

disparity between the interstate and the intrastate

9

markets.

10
11

And the second purpose was to provide

incentive prices to encourage production.
To accomplish this the Act establishes a

12

comprehensive pricing structure applicable to all

13

categories of natural gas production.

14

pricing categories of gas production applies to any

15

first sale of gas.

16

sale in Section 2(21) is very important, and that

17

definition defines first sale broadly to mean any sale

18

of any volume of natural gas.

Each of those

Therefore, the definition of first

Now to avoid this, Subsection B of Section
2(21) —

QUESTION:

Mr. McKinney, where in the briefs

do we find these sections that you’re guoting?
MR. MCKINNEY:

They are -- throughout the

briefs you will find the — Section 2(21).
QUESTION:

It’s —

I think, page two and three of the

government’s briefs is where it should be.
MR. MCKINNEY:

It’s at page two of the brief

of the mid-law respondents.
Now in Subsection B of the definition — this

12

subsection generally provides that sales by pipelines

13

are indeed not included within the first sale

14

definition.

15

pipeline production from the price ceilings of the act,

16

if could have stopped right there.

17

And if Congress had wanted to exclude

But Congress knew that while pipelines

18

function primarily as resellers they also produce their

19

own natural gas for sale by their systems.

20

respect they perform the same service as any other

21

producer and should be subject to the incentives and

22

ceilings of the Title I pricing structure.

23

And in this

Congress therefore added a critically

24

important provision.

Congress said that a pipeline or

25

distribution company sale is excluded unless -- unless

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

such sale is attributable to volumes of natural gas

2

produced by such interstate pipeline, intrastate

3

pipeline, or local distribution company or any other

4

affiliate thereof.

5

Now this language on its face plainly is

6

intended to provide that natural gas produced by

7

pipeline companies should be subject to the price

8

ceilings of the act and that the pricing structure of

9

the act apply to volumes attributable to gas produced by

10
11

the pipeline.
It doesn't go on to say, but only to the

12

extent the FERC in its discretion permits,

13

limiting language.

14

would leave -- would read the unless cause of the act.

15

or any other

Petitioner's interpretation simply

Now Petitioners argue however that their

16

interpretation would still leave some meaning to the

17

unless clause while they acknowledge that pipeline

18

production would be excluded from the acts coverage.

19

They argued that certain sales by the pipelines into

20

their systems other than their — into other systems

21

than their own, would still be covered.

22

Now the interpretation is based on the

23

following reasoning, that the intracorporate transfer of

24

gas from a pipeline's producing properties is not a

25

first sale within the meaning of the act, and secondly,

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 62S-9300

1

that the downstream sale of the gas produced by the

2

pipeline is mixed with other gas purchased by the

3

pipeline and that the sale of those volumes is not

4

exclusively comprised of the pipeline’s production,

5

words the petitioners would add to the act.
However, neither of these arguments is

8

7

supportable in any way.

The basic rationale that

8

petitioners give for their positions is that their

9

interpretation would give meaning to past commission

10

regulation of certain pipeline production on a

11

cost-of-service basis.

12

they rely upon.

25

Cost-of-service regulation hadn't

Now, in addition, it should be recognized that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

contrary to what Mr. Feit has said this morning, or this

2

afternoon, pipeline affiliates and pipelines themselves

3

for their own production were treated exactly the same

4

for comparable categories of production under Natural

5

Gas Act regulation.

6

There was absolutely no difference.

Now even assuming arguendo then that the

7

rationale they have put forward had any merit, it would

8

apply with equal force to pipeline affiliate

9

production.

And they make no argument that pipeline

10

affiliate production is not expressly covered by the

11

Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.

12

No, the rationale they put forward doesn't

13

apply at all to intrastate pipeline production or

14

distributor production.

15

that under the Natural Gas Act, and yet, Congress

16

extended its regulation under the Natural Gas Policy Act

17

to state production.

18

The commission didn't regulate

Moreover, Kr. Feit gave you no citation

19

anywhere in the legislative history of this act which

20

even remotely suggests that Congress sought to carve out

21

in-production from the sweeping coverage of the act.

22

And you can't read -- you can't read the conference

23

report accompaning this legislation and come away with

24

anything but the distinct impression Congress meant to

25

establish a comprehensive uniform pricing structure to

apply to all gas production sold in the United States

2

whether interstate or intrastate.

3

Finally, the rationale would produce absurd

4

results.

Apart from the fact that the rationale would

5

treat pipeline affiliate production differently than

6

pipeline affiliate — than pipeline production when they

7

were treated the same under Natural Gas Act regulation,

8

it also should be recognized that new gas, which is one

9

of the categories under the Title I pricing structure,

10

that new gas is no less new gas simply because it's

11

produced by a pipeline.

12

cost geological formations, has to be produced from that

13

formation irrespective of whether a pipeline or an

14

independent producer produces the gas.

Yes, produced from certain high

There are many wells throughout the country

15
16

that are jointly owned by a pipeline with other

17

producers.

18

that the gas produced from that well by a pipeline

19

should be valued any different than the gas from the

20

same well owned by an independent producer or by a

21

pipeline affiliate.

22

It is the height of absurdity to believe

Now apart from the lack of support in the

23

plain meaning of Section 2(21), there ace other

24

provisions of the act that also support the Court of

25

Appeals decision.

Section 203(b) defines the cost of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

customers.

6

The general rule of that section speaks of

However, Subsection 2 had to state a separate

The separate rule expressly recognizes that

7

the FERC must fashion rules governing the first sale

8

acquisition cost for pipeline production.

9

Now the reference to first sale acquisition

10

costs for pipeline production clearly evidences that

11

Congress envisioned pipeline production would be the

12

subject of a first sale at the intracorporate transfer

13

point, where there is no price paid.

14

is absolutely no meaning to that provision of the Act.

15

Otherwise, there

Notably also, the conference report

16

accompanying the Act states that Section 501 provides

17

authority to the commission to establish rules

18

applicable to intracorporate transactions under the

19

first sale definition.

20

Now it doesn't say that the commission can

21

exclude sales fron the coverage of the act.

It says

22

that the commission may establish rules applicable to

23

intracorporate transactions under the first sale

In fact, there is nothing in the Act which

How, petitioners argue that intracorporate
transfers do not involve certain convential indicia of a

10

sale such as a change of title or payment of cash.

11

Petitioners’ arguments in this respect are refuted by

12

the plain meaning of the Act and by the commission's own

13

regulatory methods.

14

The term

"sale” is not defined narrowly in

15

Section 2(20), but broadly to include any sale, exchange

16

or other transfer for value.

17

properly rejected the narrow interpretation because it

18

would have frustrated the comprehesive application of

19

the act, and because it would have resulted in a

20

rational discrimation between like categories of gas

21

production.

22

Now the Court of Appeals

Contrary to petitioners' argument the

intracorporate transfer does have significant legal and

economic effects and they are transfers for value.

independent producers.

But between the independent

13

for that.

14

We wouldn't be here if it weren’t

But let me put that money in context.
There's an Appendix D filed to the

15

Consolidated Natural Gas Company brief in this

16

proceeding which clearly shows that the impact of

17

applying Natural Gas Policy Act prices to pipeline

18

production is less than one and one half percent of the

19

total impact of the Natural Gas Policy Act for the

20

period of 1979 to 1981.

21

Now pipelines during that period contributed

22

about five percent of U.S. production and this would

23

strongly suggest that independent producer prices rise

24

more than pipeline production under the Natural Gas

25

Policy Act.

And I think, it should be noted by this

38

difference between the two?

MR. MCKINNEY*

I'm very glad you asked that.

4

The price levels would have varied, of course, from

pipeline to pipeline but I certainly represent a

6

pipeline where — which would have given its left arm to

How typical was that situation?

I think it probably would have

been more typical than not typical, although that would

First, Justice Stevens, if the affiliate

investor risk under the parity and national rates, so

that there was a difference, cost-of-service gas was

On their wellhead sales, but

insofar as a pipeline affiliate production went into the

pipeline transmission system, was that priced on a

MR. FEIT;

In the '70’s it was not.

It was not, so the two of you

If it were — I don't know -- less

17

Well this is quite important to me

18

because it's a rather dramatic difference between what

the Court is being told by the two adversaries here.

You're a hundred percent sure you're right on this?
MR. FEIT*

I’m right.

Not — never a hundred percent sure

QUESTION:

9

No it's — your whole argument is

that all they want to do is overrule Phillips.

And if,

10

to the extent that he’s right on what he's represented

11

to the Court, that’s a big hole in your argument.

12

MR. FEITs

Well I don’t —

13

QUESTION:

Because if that was cost-of-service

14

pricing for this body of production, however significant

15

it may be, the commission has changed and maybe that’s

16

because the statutory language is clear.

17

MR. FEIT;

As my understanding is, by the

18

'70's whether it was sold to the pipeline or to a third

19

party, it was on area national rates.

20

Justice Rehnquist, you refer to what what

21

other provisions of the Act would refer to — Title 6

22

deals with interstate pipelines and the costing of

23

interstate pipelines.

24

obviously the pipeline purchased that from the producer.

25

It talks about a first sale as if

At the bottom of the case though, it seems to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

me, that we're talking about cost-of-service gas which

2

is always been priced on traditional cost-of-service

3

pricing.

4

that Congress wanted to overrule that determination.

5

And it seems to us that if it had it would

There is nothing in this statute that suggests

8

independent producer pricing.

9
10

What appears here constantly is

Unless the Court has any further questions.
QUESTIONS

Let me just ask this one question.

11

If your opponent were right about the affiliate gas, and

12

then by the definition of sale, Congress did say

13

something as to that gas, because clearly there is a

14

sale within the literal language of the statute when a

15

sale from a subsidiary to the parent.

16

And it did say something if he is right on his

17
18
19
20
21

MR. FEIT:

If, in fact -- if, in fact, that

was a first sale, right.
QUESTION;

But it would be under the plain

language of the statute.

22

MR. FEIT;

Well if — if --

23

QUESTION;

Which would probably explain why

24
25

the commission now draws that distinction.
MR. FEIT;

Well it draws the distinction since

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

the early

Unless the Court has any further questions.

3

QUESTION*

4
5

How significant/ on the increase

that we’re talking about —
MR. FEITi

Yes, I wanted to mention that.

We

6

haven’t retroactively determined the amounts, but

7

speculatively we’re talking about $200 million a year.

8

And somewhere over $2 billion until this old gas —

9

me just make a reference — you reminded me -- it's

10
11

let

about $2 billion total.
The real issue here is economically a stripper

12

well gas, which means a well is depleted.

13

Cost-of-service has — the consumer has borne the risk.

14

This is the highest price of regulated gas under the

15

Natural Gas Policy Act pricing scheme if first sale

18

prices were attributed to it, the pipeline company would

17

be able to charge off all of the expenses of

18

redeveloping that well on the highest -- or one of

19

highest NGPA pricing structures.

20

And it seems to us that in a section floor

21

proceeding the normal way a pipeline gets its rates,

22

prudent costs would apply.

23

a consumer has borne all the risks.

24

and suddenly incentive pricing permits these kinds of

25

prices to go to interstate pipelines.

But here you're saying that

QUESTIONS

Hay I ask., this question?

In the

2

conversation about windfall and about increased costs of

3

gas, did not Congress contemplate that there would be an

4

increase in the cost of gas as a result of the 1978 Act?

5

NR. FEITs

Congress did but --

6

QUESTION;

At least initially, the theory was

7

that over time as more gas was produced, the economics

8

of it would bring the price back down.

9

MR. FEITs

Yes, but I think in terms of a

10

response to you, there was nothing in the Congressional

11

debates that one of the incentive pricing schemes would

12

apply to any other than independent producers and those

13

that function like independent producers.

14

QUESTION;

What about affiliates?

15

MR. FEITs

That's — my point is, you’re

16

getting a response to the question, that affiliates up

17

to the late

18

independent producers.

19

'60*s and early

'70*s functioned like

The history is such that the Court must

20

remember that up until the decision in Phillips the

21

question of production ingathering was a problem.

22

affiliate might not very well have been even deemed to

23

be covered by the Act.

24

where affiliate production became more and more like

25

independent producer production.

And it was in the late

An

’60's

The commission’s

1

approach in the '70's and in Order 98, at the enactment

2

of the 1978 Act, was precisely that.

3

affiliate, whether he sold to a third party or through

4

his pipeline, is selling like an independent producer,

5

and in our view, is entitled to that kind of pricing

6

while the pipeline — as long as he doesn’t make a first

7

sale — if he makes a first sale, as Herweg defined it,

8

is not — a mixed system supply is not entitled to first

9

sale pricing.

10

QUESTION*

That the

But apart from everything else our

11

duty, as you suggested at the outset, is to construe the

12

language of the Act and its legislative history to

13

ascertain Congressional intent.

14

MR. FEIT;

That’s exactly what would be --

15

QUESTION*

Without regard to who loses what

MR. FEITs

Without regard except that it

17

where.

18

suggests itself to me that Congress would hardly have

19

adopted a theory without any affirmative statement to

that effect which would have lead to what we think are

21

the windfall pricing that would follow from treating

22

pipeline production as a first sale.
