ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAE M. CROWE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

11

MR. CROWE:

✓

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
This piece of legislation, passed in Alabama in 1979,

12

involves several constitutional questions which have been

13

raised by producers or servers of natural gas and crude oil

14

within the state.

15

It was introduced in 1979 by Representative Hines

16

of Escambia County, one of the state's largest producing counties

17

insofar as oil and gas production is concerned.

18

was introduced to increase the tax two percent state-wide.

It initially

19

Representative Hines, according to the record, had

20

failed to pass this legislation in three previous occasions.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Is he able to pass legislation all by

himself or does the legislature pass it?
MR. CROWE:

He can pass legislature under local

24

courtesy if it affects only his county, he being the only

25

representative from the county, from that district, in the
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

State of Alabama.

2
3

QUESTION:

But, is it actually — Is the bill actually

enacted, at least in form, by the whole legislature?

4

MR. CROWE:

5

When he encountered the difficulty with the Speaker

6

of the House, by his own testimony, in the Governor's office,

7

in the House Ways and Means Committee, he submitted a very

8

important amendment, we submit, as a matter of legislative

9

history.

10

Yes.

This tax was four percent.

It was increased to two

11

percent.

12

so-called depth proviso which provided, in effect, that provided,

13

however, that the increase shall be limited to well producing in a

14

smackover formation at the depth of 15/15.8.

15

At the foot of the taxing paragraph, he entered a

His county was, according to the record, the only

16

county in the state, then and now, producing hydrocarbons

17

in this geological interval at this depth.

18

He represented to the committees and on the floor

19

that his amendment had made the bill local, applied to his

20

own county.

21

this.

22

He was quoted in the newspapers as having said

And, the bill passed with no nays essentially.
Accordingly, the bill received local courtesy.

The

23

Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee so testified.

24

legislative journal entries show that the bill was carried

25

on the journal as an uncontested local bill along with

The

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Counsel, I am a little uncertain

why — If the enactment passed the legislature, what difference
does it make how it got there?
MR. CROWE:

It makes a difference in this respect:

Our clients are non-Escambia County producers which were not
expected to have been taxed under the legislation.

Once the

bill had been passed, the Commissioner of Revenue, the
Appellee here, construed it legally to be a state-wide measure.
Refund suits were filed by the producers, the non-Escambia
County producers; uncontested legislative history in the form
11

of journal entries, physical notes, limiting the revenues only

12

to Escambia County.

13

There was no contrary legislative history.

The Circuit Court of Montgomery County reads that

14

the act, under the legislative history, was clearly and without

15

any question a local act applying only to one county out of 67.

16

QUESTION:

What federal claim do you make out of all

17

these facts?

18

the final say as to whether or not —

19

I mean, doesn't the Supreme Court of Alabama have

MR. CROWE:

I realize that this Court does not,

20

Justice Rehnquist, involved generally in statutory construction

21

of state statutues.

QUESTION:

Aren't we bound by what the Alabama Supreme

Court rules?
MR. CROWE:

I think we cite in our brief two cases

5

that indicate — One is a Missouri case, the Brinkerhoff case,

6

where this Court held that actions of the Missouri Supreme

7

Court deprived the litigants there of due process.

Well, there are lots of opinions from this

Court that say the same thing, aren't there?
MR. CROWE:

Under circumstances, however, where there

16

is uncontroverted testimony from the sponsor himself, the sole

17

and only sponsor, that it was his intention to tax his own county

18

to address a revenue shortfall in his own county.

19
20
21

QUESTION:

I speak only for myself, but I hope you

have a better federal claim than that one.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crowe, on a slightly different subject,

22

as I understand it, the Commissioner now takes the position that

23

the act in question does not prohibit producers, working

24

producers, from passing through the increase in severance taxes

25

just so long as they don't do it as taxes.
,6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Now, if that position is correct, how have your clients

2

suffered any injury?

3

MR. CROWE:

Well, first, during the currency of this

4

act, they were prohibited from passing through the severance

5

taxes.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CROWE:

8

QUESTION:

9

As taxes.
As a tax.
And — So, I am curious how you establish

your injury if the Commissioner's present position is correct.

10

MR. CROWE:

All right.

Justice O'Connor, the contracts

11

fix a price.

12

Act for various categories of natural gas fix a price.

13

either by virtue of the maximum statutory ceiling price and/or

14

by virtue of the contract provisions themselves, we could only

15

charge the price either permitted by law or agreed to by con­

16

tract,

17

wording of the contract.

18

They fix a definite price.

The National Gas Policy

but were permitted to pass on taxes under the express

QUESTION:

Do we have the proof in front of us that

19

would clearly establish that your clients could not have

20

increased the price to take care of this --

21

And,

MR. CROWE:

The contracts are in the record.

22

of course, the law is that —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CROWE:

QUESTION:

And,

And they allow escalation of prices.
The contracts?
Uh-huh.

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

MR. CROWE:

I am not certain whether — The price

2

escalation was not involved here.

3

Some of them may have and some of them may have not depending upon

4

QUESTION:

In other words, we don't really know whether

5

your clients suffered any injury.

6

determine that?

7

MR. CROWE:

I am not sure whether they —

Would we have to remand to

I think you do know, Justice O'Connor,

8

that the clients who could not pass through the severance

9

statutes as agreed upon and had to swallow that tax suffered

10
11
12
13

the loss of the amount of tax that they could not pass through.
QUESTION:

But, we don't know, if I may pursue it

further, whether they could have passed it on in some other form?
MR. CROWE:

I think they could not have because the

14

NGPA mandates the maximum price in both intra and interstate

15

commerce and the contracts, some of which predated the NGPA,

16

specified what that price would be.

17

Turning for a moment to the equal protection arguments

18

that we have advanced to the Court with respect to the Royalty

19

Owners Exemption, the Act in question exempted the royalty owners

20

from the two percent increase, but apparently left the royalty

21

owners subject to the four percent portion of the tax.

22

The record shows that we had both leases as well as

23

the contracts, to which Justice O'Connor referred, which

24

specifically provided in the case of the leases that the lessee

25

and the lessor will share and bear the severance tax prorata.

There is a mineral fee, if the Court will, a producing

The lessee owns a share in it as a joint tenant.
This Court has held in Barwise v. Sheppard that an

oil and gas lease constitutes nothing more or less than a common

accordance with the terms and provisions of the lease.
Thus, we submit that a lessor is a royalty owner and

12

the — is a land owner, and the lessee is likewise a land owner

13

under the jurisprudence of Alabama and most oil producing states.

14

There are three reasons for this.

The Alabama Code

15

specifically provides that the tax will be levied in proportion

16

to ownership.

17

producers shall include a royalty owner.

18

specifically says that the tax is levied on the full stream of

19

the well including that known as the royalty interest.

The Alabama Code specifically provides that

can be — where it says four percent of the tax will be borne

We submit to the Court that there is another reason

that makes the tax regressive.

about a regressive tax?
MR. CROWE:

Well, I think it is a question of

classification and equal protection within the price.
QUESTION:

Well, I suppose I agree with you, but you

13

said you are arguing now that the tax is regressive and a

MR. CROWE:

Well, it does not apply equally even

between lessees.
QUESTION:

Well, no taxes apply equally.

Some

people are taxed and some are not.
MR. CROWE:

Well, what I am saying, I think, is,

20

Justice Rehnquist, that the tax does not apply equally between

21

either royalty owners or working interest owners or land owners.

22

And, if that — the land owner should be the criteria for making

23

a distinction between one molecule of gas and another molecule of

24

gas; that the

between the royalty-interest side and the working-interest side.

5

It simply is that some people prefer to invest on the royalty

side and others invest on the working-interest side.

One of

So there is no societal distinction

In the Barwise case which I previously referred to, it

8

was a Texas tax involved which was equally imposed on the full

9

production of the well both on the lessor and the lessee.

And

10

this Court held that it was a reasonable classification as to

11

both the lessor as it was to the lessee.

12

the proposition we are submitting to the Court is a 1937 decision

of this Court in Barwise v. Sheppard.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

Our authority for

MR. ARENDALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court-:
Before Act 434 was adopted by the legislature of

19

Alabama, the state had a very simple and understandable tax

20

scheme for the severance taxation of oil and gas production.

21

The tax was imposed on all of the oil and gas produced.

22

was a definition of who were the producers of that gas or oil.

23

It included both the royalty owner and the working-interest

24

owner, each of whom bore the ultimate incidence of the tax in

increase that was provided by that statute exempts the royalty

owner — the royalty owner's share of production — from any

6

portion of the tax increase.

7

"any person who is a royalty owner shall be exempt from the

8

payment of any increase in taxes herein levied and shall not be

9

liable therefore."

When Act 434 was passed, however, we find a drastic

The language of the statute was

To make doubly clear the intent of the

10

legislature, they then proceeded with what is called in the

11

briefing in this case the Pass-Through Prohibition in which

12

they say, " the privilege tax herein levied shall be absorbed

13

and paid by those persons engaged in the business of producing

MR. ARENDALL:

That —

As construed by the state, that is what

23

it means.

24

a background of a statutory scheme where the statutory definition

25

But that construction, if Your Honor please, comes in

of producers unchanged by Act 434 covers both the royalty owner

1

and the working-interest owner.

2
3

QUESTION:

And so any—

The two percent specifically excluded the

royalty owner — the amendment?

4

MR. ARENDALL:

Well, it depends, if the Court please,

5

on whether they have by implication repealed the definition of

6

producer which we do not think that they have because, among

7

other things, the statute continues to say that the tax shall be

8

imposed on all of the production including the share of the

9

royalty owner.

Now this comes in a posture where the

evidence

10

showed my clients, for example, had leases where the land owner

11

would expressly agree to pay his proportionate share of severance

12

taxes.

13

expressly agree to pay any increase in severance taxes.

14

because of the existence of those contracts, our first contention

15

is that there has been an unconstitutional impairment of

16

contracts.

denial of the equal protection of the law.

MR. ARENDALL:

Yes, I do, Justice O'Connor, and I

recall your question to Mr. Crowe on that subject.

As we

endeavor to point out in our reply brief, the Commissioner is
engaged in an absolutely impermissible attempt to rewrite the

MR. ARENDALL:

10

When you say, as the language that

The language, at least, does not make it

QUESTION:

Mr. Arendall, you mentioned two questions

that you saw in this case.

I must — I have this case confused

with some other case on the calendar.

I had been under the

22

impression that at least one question was whether this area —

23

this Alabama statute — had been preempted by federal law?

24

MR. ARENDALL:

25

QUESTION:

Well, that is certainly an additional —

I have not heard the word preemption from

anyone yet.

2

MR. ARENDALL:

That is certainly an additional question

addressed in our brief that the government — as Amigee has

addressed.

6

interesting in this regard and in connection with Justice

this complete misreading of the statute claiming that we could

Well, are you going to discuss the pre­

emption issue in your argument?

13

MR. ARENDALL:

14

QUESTION:

15

Yes, I expect to, and I —

Well how else can you win this case except

on a federal constitutional ground such as preemption?

MR. ARENDALL:

Well, it seems to be that we have three

MR. ARENDALL:

QUESTION:

On both acts did you present the preemption

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

question?

2

MR. ARENDALL:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ARENDALL:

No, we did not.

We presented the

preemption question solely on the NGPA.

7

8

Did you present the preemption question on

both Acts?

5

6

I beg, sir.

QUESTION:

Well, then what right do you have to do it

on the other Act here if you did not present —

9

MR. ARENDALL:

We have not, sir.

My clients have not.

10

The reason — a reason being, first that we think it is

11

clear that the statutory prohibition and its conflict with the

12

NGPA is not a severable item.

13

intended to say you cannot pass-through as to gas but you can as

14

to oil.

15

it gets stricken.

16

In the second place, two of my clients are engaged in the Tully

17

litigation.

18

addressed in the federal courts, the federal court system at Topeka.

19

The legislature of Alabama never

So that if it is bad under the NGPA, it is bad.

And,

And, we think that is the easy, clear argument.

It is their belief that the EPAA issues are properly

If we were asked to express an opinion, and if this

20

Court cares to pass on an EPAA thing, we certainly agree with

21

the position taken by Amigee in its brief on that question.

22

But, we did not argue that in our brief.

23

What this act has done, is not only, you see, to tax the

24

producer, the working interest owner, on his own share of produc­

25

tion, but has required that he pick up the tax and pay it on the
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

royalty owners'interest share of production.

2

to the definition of who shall be producers — completely contrary,

3

we believe, to this Court's opinion in Barwise v. Sheppard.

4

it is interesting to see that when the state addresses the

5

impairment question here, he makes no effort to try to meet the

6

kinds of tests that the Court has laid down in Blazedale and his

7

progeny insofar as the circumstances under which contracts may be

8

impaired.

9

probably was trying to avoid being perceived as levying a consumer

Completely contrary

Now,

All he does in substance is to say that the legislature

tax.

11

the legislature, but it certainly in our judgment does not express

12

the kind of broad public general societal purpose that is required

13

if you are going to have a constitutional impairment.

14

this instance, our reasonable contractual expectations were cer­

15

tainly destroyed.

16

correct in rewriting the statute as they attempted to do, how do

17

they take the part — what about the royalty owner?

18

say about that?

They do not say we can

it says is that the first seller of the natural gas is allowed to

the first sale of natural gas, subject to the limitations of the

14

that under the Alabama law and a reading of the NGPA it is per­

15

fectly permissible for the first seller of the natural gas to

include in the maximum lawful price the increase in the tax,

just so long as he does not tack it on as a tax.

QUESTION:

Mr. Breckenridge, would it be fair to say

14

that the Supreme Court of Alabama interpreted as narrowly as

conceivable the anti pass-on provision where the legislature

16

said you can't pass it on directly or indirectly?

17

maybe you might have read that requirement the same, that the

18

only way to absorb it is after you declare a dividend to the

19

stockholders you have to take the tax out of that dividend.

20

But, the Alabama Supreme Court came out at the other end of

21

the spectrum and said that really all we are talking about is

22

you can't add it to a quoted price.

23
24

MR. BRECKENRIDGE:

I suppose

I would agree with that, Justice

Rehnquist.
The Appellants have also raised certain issues about

have cited the Barwise case.

in favor of the State of Alabama or the Commissioner of Revenue's

13

I would like to point out, and I am sure that the

14

should any portion of this Act be deemed unconstitutional the

13

remainder of the Act shall stand, shall survive; that the Court,

14

as the very least, would have to send it back down to the State

15

Supreme Court of Alabama to determine whether or not — what

16

effect the Severability Clause has.

17

Now, it is a matter of record that less than ten

18

months later the legislature of Alabama adopted the identical

19

language of that 79-434 and they left out one sentence, the

20

Pass-Through Prohibition, and they added on sentence that

21

allowed unitization method of reporting.

22

We think this is highly persuasive that the Pass-

23

Through Prohibition was not an essential part of the 79 Act.

24

so as to cause the whole Act to fall.

Wouldn't we have to address it?
I don't think so.

I could suggest

If they are right on the equal protection,

8

if that issue is properly here, and if they are right on it,

it means that the two cent exclusion of the royalty owner is

unconstitutional, right?

11

MR. BRECKENRIDGE:

No, sir.

I will say why.

I think

12

what the Court would do is if it decided to strike down the

13

Pass-Through Prohibition and send it back down to the Alabama

14

Supreme Court, usually this prudent Court waits until the

15

State Supreme Court has ruled on that question before it will —

16

The State Supreme Court may strike the whole statute down, it

17

may not.

18

The equal protection argument is — If I may go over what the

19

equal protection argument is, they are saying, because the

20

Supreme Court of Alabama refused to accept their version of

the legislative history, things they call legislative history,

that they were denied equal protection in the state court.

With regard to the royalty owner

No, that is still there.

BRECKENRIDGE:

Let me reiterate.

There were only

two changes in the statute ten months later; one, the Anti Pass-

Through Prohibition was deleted, and a method of reporting on

the unitization method was added.

How do you justify — Say you have one—Two

QUESTION:

Do you understand they are making an equal

QUESTION:

So, Justice Stevens has to be correct,

4

doesn't he, that if the tax is paid by the working interest

and the royalty interests are exempt, then this tax burdens some

producers more than others.

for charging one producer a higher rate simply because he has a

That is a matter of statutory construction.
That is correct.

But, if you construe the statute your way,

it does have the affect of charging different producers

MR. BRECKENRIDGE:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

No, but the producer — If the producer

2

has a smaller percentage interest in the lease and they all pay

3

two percent on total production, the producer with the smaller

4

percentage is paying a higher percentage on what he actually

5

earns.

6

MR. BRECKENRIDGE:

If they all pay two percent on

7

their production and one producer produces more, is a larger

8

producer than the others, I don't see how that is a denial of

9

equal protection.

The smaller producer could produce more.

I

10

could make $1 million and pay income on $1 million or I could —

11

I don't see where that is denial of equal protection.

What we are doing here is so long as you treat every

member of the class or subclass the same you are not denying

MR. BRECKENRIDGE:

I disagree, because —

The tax is going to be more burdensome.
I disagree, because they can't —

Neither one of them can pass a law on the increase to the royalty

owner.

They are both going to bear 100% of the tax.
