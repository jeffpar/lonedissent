CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments

4 Committee.
5’

Mr. Brown, I think you may proceed whenever you

6 are ready.
7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY ELSON BROWN, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

9

MR. BROWNt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court, this case involves the
11

constitutionality of the provisions of Ohio’s Campaign

12 Expense Reporting Act, which requires campaign
13 committees to file reports setting forth various
14 information concerning their receipt and expenditure of
15 campaign funds.
16

This case was initiated in 1974 by various

17 Socialist Workers Party candidates and their campaign
18 committees along with several unnamed persons who
19 claimed to have made contributions to or received
20 expenditures from those campaign committees.
21

A temporary restraining order was entered soon

22 after this case was filed, and it enjoined the
23 application of the disclosure provisions of the Ohio law
24 to the Socialist Workers Party candidates and their
25 committees throughout the pendency of this action.

3

1

The case was tried in February of 1981, and on

2 June 25,

1981, a three-judge panel held that the

3 disclosure provisions of Ohio Revised Code Sections
4 3517.10 and 3517.11
5

are unconstitutional as applied to

the Socialist Workers Party and the class represented by

6 the individual appellees in that case.
7

It is our position in this case that the

8 district court erred in so holding because it misapplied

9 the test established by this Court in Buckley versus
10

Valeo in 1976.

11

QUESTION*

12

MR. BROWN;

Is this just a factual argument then?
Absolutely not. Your Honor.

It is

13 a matter of applying the law of the case in Buckley
14 versus Valeo.
15

QUESTION*

16

MR. BROWN*

To the facts.
We are going to have to apply the

17 facts to the law.
18

QUESTION;

19 the wrong standard,
20
21

MR. BROWN*

But you don’t claim the court used
legal standard.
Absolutely not.

Buckley test is most acceptable.

We think the

We think the district

22 court in applying the facts in this case to the Buckley
23 test misapplied the Buckley test.
24

QUESTION;

Is this a question then, a mixed

25 question of fact and law?

MR. BROWN*

It is one of those cases where it

is a mixed question of fact and law because —
QUESTION*

3

Can we independently arrive at it,

4

or do we have to find that the court was clearly

5

erroneous?
MR. BROWN*

6

No, I don't — you don't have to

7 dispute any of the court's factual findings.
8

What I am

asking you to do is find that the court applied this

9 Court's Buckley standard improperly.

It is a mixed

10

question of law and fact.

Obviously, the Buckley test

11

itself requires a mixed law and fact consideration. Your

12 Honor.

Specifically, and this is our primary point in

13

14 this case, specifically, the evidence presented in the
15 district court did not demonstrate a reasonable
16 probability that the disclosure of the names of
17 contributors to Socialist Worker Party candidates in
18 Ohio and the disclosure of the names of persons
19 receiving funds from SWP candidates'

campaign committees

20 would subject those contributors or recipients of
21

expenditures to threats, harassment, or reprisals, which

22 is what this Court said to look for in Buckley versus
23 Valeo.
24

QUESTION*

The district court says, concludes,

25 I infer from these historical facts which he has found,

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which you don’t dispute, or nobody disputes about, I

2 infer or predict that there would be reprisal or some
3

injury in the future if there is disclosure.

4

say that is not a factual finding.
MB. BROWN*

5

Now, you

Is that it?

That is an application of this

6 Court's standards to the facts in the case.

QUESTION*

7

Well, it is a finding.

He says, I

8 find that there would be injury.

Coming out of Buckley versus

Well, I know, but there are a lot of

bottom line findings that are still facts.

18

Well, is that —

It is the application of this Court's Buckley

QUESTION*

15
16

That is correct, but that is the

Did I understand you to say that

there is no evidence to support any such finding as that?
MR. BROWN*

19

We are saying that the record

20 considered as a whole does not support the finding made
21

by the district court in this case.

As we go through

22 our discussion of the case, I will further explain why I
23

think the totality if the evidence does not support that

24

finding•

25

In this case, despite joining unnamed John Doe

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

plaintiffs who allegedly contributed to or received

2 campaign funds from the Socialist Worker Party
3 candidates,

the appellees failed to produce any

4 evidence, any evidence in the district court of any
5 actual or threatened harassment of a single contributor
6 or recepient of campaign expenditures in Ohio.

Additionally, and this, Justice White, is the

7

8 biggest problem we have with the evidence, additionally,
9 the vast majority of the evidence introduced by the
10 appellees in this case pertained to historical past
11

activities of agencies of the federal government over

12 which the State of Ohio has absolutely no control.

Moreover, the activities of these federal

13

14 agencies took place irrespective of and in the absence
15 of Ohio's campaign expense reporting law.

There is no

16 cause and effect relationship between our Act and the
17 conduct and the misconduct of the FBI.

Of the 127

18 exhibits admitted into evidence at trial on this case,
19

121 of those exhibits pertained solely to FBI activities

20 which were discontinued, which

21

22

1971.

were discontinued in

This case went to trial in 1981.
Our position is that this FBI conduct and

23 misconduct may not be irrelevant as a matter of law, but
24 it is of no material appropriate value certainly in
25

1981, especially in view of the —

MR. BROWNs

I mean you know what the FBI is

going to do next year?
MR. BROWNs

10

11

We cited the Oregon case which

contained references to affidavits --

8
9

What kind of evidence was that?

I have a good feeling of what the

FBI is not going to do next year.

12

QUESTION:

That wasn’t my question.

My

13

question was, do you know what the FBI is going to do

14

tomorrow?
MR. BROWNs

15

that.

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

1981.

That’s correct. Your Honor.

took that long. Your Honor.

I guess that is

why I said that.
QUESTION»

Did they even convert it to a

13 preliminary injunction?
14

HR. BROWN»

It was never converted.

The

15 original TRO entered in this case in and of itself by
16 the original trial court was rather strange in that the
17 court entered a TRO during the pendency of the action
18 which would not expire until the case was decided by a
19 three-judge panel which hadn't even been empaneled yet.
20
21

QUESTION»

Well, that is clearly a violation of

civil rules, if you would want to challenge it.

You

22 can't enter a temporary restraining order and say it
23 extends for months and months.
24

HR. BROWN»

I certainly don't disagree with

25 that, Justice Rehnquist.

Like I said, I didn't file —

Yes, they requested the temporary
I don't know whether they requested

6 it for the entire pendency of the action or not, but
7

even if they did, I think it would be a violation of

8 civil rules.

I agree with that.

QUESTION:

9

Was it ever challenged on that

10

ground, that the temporary restraining order was

11

improperly —

challenged that, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I guess the state really couldn't

have been terribly upset about it, if they let it sit

20 for six years.
21

MR. BROWN:

Well, the state is now terribly

22 upset about it.
23

QUESTION:

24

MR. BROWN:

25

Now it is upset.
They didn't know at the time it was

going to take six years.

I imagine that it was

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

tolerated through time on the premise that the case

2 would be decided much more rapidly than it was.
3

QUESTIONS

I suppose the character of that

4

order might have some relationship to the fact there is

5

no evidence of any threats or harassment since 1975, or

6 the people would be in contempt.
7

MR. BROUNs

It has some relationship to no

8 threats or harassments — because we weren't listing
9

their identities, but it certainly doesn't detract from

10

my argument that the FBI evidence is very, very stale

11

and of no future probative value, which is my major

12 evidentiary argument, and which I think is the key to
13
14

this case.
Justice Harhsal, you asked me about what the

15

FBI was going to do tomorrow, and I can't stand here and

16

tell you that, but the Senate empaneled a select

17

committee to study intelligence operations —

18
19

20
21

QUESTION;

Do you know what the Senate is going

to do tomorrow?
MR. BROWN;

I don't know what the Senate is

going to do tomorrow, but I do know that the Senate

22 committee found —
23

QUESTION;

24

MR. BROWN;

25

They are gone right now, you know.
I do know. Justice Marshal, that

the Senate found that the FBI did terminate its conduct

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and its misconduct vis-a-vis the Socialist Workers Party

2

and its candidates and its party members in 1971.

3

QUESTION*

4

never do it again?

5

MR. BROWN*

6

QUESTION*

7 answer is.

Did the Senate say» and the FBI will

No.

The FBI has —

Well, I don't understand what your

I asked you, could you predict what the FBI

8 was going to do in the future.

MR. BROWN*

9

QUESTION*

10

That is my question.

Justice Marshal, I —
The only truthful answer could

11

possibly be, you don't know.

12

MR. BROWN*

13

QUESTION*

That is correct.
Is there any evidence in this record

14 that suggests any resumption of that kind of activity

15 over the last ten years?
MR. BROWN*

16

)

No, there is no evidence in this

17 record to suggest resumption of the Cointelpro Program,
18 which was the FBI's disruption and harassment program,
19 which was specifically addressed to the Socialist
20 Workers Party, directed to the Socialist Workers Party,
21

and in the Oregon case there were affidavits submitted

22 by the FBI
23 program.

which said that they had discontinued that
Since that time. Congress, recognizing that

24 the FBI and
25 during

other intelligence agencies have a tendency

times of stress in this country to get out of

1

hand, has enacted legislation which will further

2 preclude the probability, not the possibility,

I

3 understand that, but the probability of future programs
4 like this being started in this country.
5
6

So, my answer is, no, I can’t predict what is
possible, but I can predict, Justice Harhal, what is

7 probable, and it is not probable —
8

QUESTION;

You could have answered that 15

9 minutes ago.
10

NR. BROWN:

Okay.

I’m sorry.

11

In our case, if reference to the FBI and the

12 multitude of its real or alleged improprieties were to
13 be deleted from this case, it is our position that there
14 would be nothing left of the evidence introduced by the
15 appellees in the district court but a small collection
16 of isolated and unrelated incidents of verbal and
17 illegal physical abuse directed toward Socialist Worker
18 Party members, candidates,
19 the country,

and party headquarters around

along with a very limited number of

20 employment terminations, which had more to do with
21

inappropriate behavior on the job than with political

22 beliefs or even political conduct.
23

QUESTION*

24 two things,

Hr. Brown, the Ohio statute requires

as I understand it, one a disclosure of

25 contributions, contributors, names of contributors —

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

NR. BROWN*

In certain instances, not all of

2 them.
3

QUESTION*

— and secondly, disclosure of

4 payment of expenditures to other people.
5

MR. BROWN*

6

QUESTION*

That is correct. Justice O’Connor.
Was there any evidence in the record

7 about the effect of requiring disclosure of the payments
8 of expenditures to others, as opposed to evidence of
9 harassment of members of the party, which presumably
10 might include contributors?
11

MR. BROWN*

Justice O’Connor, there is not one

12 thread of evidence in this record presented by the
13 appellees which showed any harassment of any recipient
14 of an expenditure.
15

MR. BROWN*

Did the state argue that there was

16 a difference in the two categories, and say, well, maybe
17 you have evidence going to contributors, but you have
18 none insofar as the expenditure requirement is concerned?
19

MR. BROWN*

That argument was made.

We sort of

20 qot caught off guard by the trial court’s decision in
21 this case.

We thought it was going to go just to

22 contributors.

The trial court's decision, the

23 injunction decision ultimately, the unconstitutionality
24 as applied decision went to both contributors and
25 expenditures, but as I read the Buckley test, the

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Buckley case, there isn't a word in that case about

2 recipients of expenditures being exempted from the
3

disclosure requirements of a state or the federal

4

statute.
QUESTION*

5

Do you think the state's interest is

6 different as between disclosure of expenditures and
7

disclosure of contributors?
NR * BROWNs

8
9

No, I don't think the state's

interest is really different.

Ohio's statute is not

10

exactly like the federal statute.

Ohio has no

11

limitations on the amount that can be contributed to any

12

given candidate’s campaign.

13

have or does not have limitations on the amount of

14

expenditures a candidate can make.

15

least restrictive means of regulating the electoral

16

process in this manner, Justice O'Connor.

Ohio did not originally

Ohio's Act is the

We simply say, let the people know how

17
18

candidates raise their money.

19

how they spend their money.

Let the electorate know
And we feel that will deter

20 actual corruption, will deter the appearance of
21

corruption and impropriety, and will give the electorate

22 an informed basis upon which to make rational judgments
23

at the ballot box.

That is the least restrictive means

24

available to regulate this area of the electoral

25

process.

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Another thing about the evidence presented in

2

this case# it certainly doesn't establish that there is

3

any causal relationship between the disclosure

4

requirement from which the appellees seek exemption and

5 the harassment they claim will occur if compliance is
6 required.
7

There is absolutely no evidence of this in

the case.

Obviously, Ohio's disclosure statute is

8 supported by the same public policy arguments as which

9 supported the Federal Campaign Election Act, which this
10

Court addressed in Buckley versus Valeo.

11

very, very important public interests, and the Ohio

12 statute is no different in

13 Act,

Those are

that sense from the federal

and this Court was asked to'grant blanket

14 exemptions for minority parties from the disclosure
15 provisions of the federal Act, and

this Court did not

16 see fit to do so.

QUESTION*

17

Mr. Brown, do you think the language

18 in Buckley is addressed to any sort of harassment or
19 bothering that might result from the fact of disclosure
20 of persons of the statute or is it addressed more
21

particularly to harassment that would be perpetrated by

22 the entity,

HR. BROWNs

23
24 Your

governmental entity requiring disclosure?
Well, as I read the Buckley test,

Honor, it creates a very — a reasonably loose

25 standard.

It doesn't only go to harassment which could

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

be caused by the government, the state government.

It

2 also goes to harassment which could be brought forth by
3

private citizens, for example, if that is responsive to

4

your question.
QUESTION:

5

Yes.

The Buckley statement as I

6 read it is based on some of the earlier cases like NAACP
7 versus Alabama,

and NAACP versus Button.

MB. BROWN*

8

9 case in 1934.

That’s correct, and the Burrells

The major distinction, and I think this

10

is very notable and should be brought out in this

11

argument, is, NAACP versus Alabama was a case which

12

enunciated a general First Amendment principle.

13 However, the state interest underlying or involved in
14 NAACP versus Alabama was in no measure comparable to the
15

state interest involved in this case or in the Buckley

16 case.
17

Alabama, versus a piece of reform legislation directed

18 at

the electoral process in our case and in the Buckley

19 case.

20
21

It was a mere discovery dispute in NAACP versus

There is a very important distinction there.
One of the other things brought out in this

Court's opinion in *the Buckely case which we would like

22 to address is the discussion of a minor party’s impact
23 on the election process in any given state.

This Court

24 said that a minor party's impact on elections — when it
25 addressed that issue, it looked

to whether or not minor

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

parties were likely to win in any given election.

We

2 think that that focus is a little bit misdirected.

It

3

is more than just whether or not a minor party is likely

4

to win an election.

5

concerns a minor party’s potential impact on the outcome

It is more — the true question

6 of any given election.
7

If it has that impact, it is more than just a

8 mere minor party that appears on the ballot, has no
9

impact, and goes away.

In Ohio, for example, in the

10

1974 gubernatorial election, one of the plaintiffs in

11

this case, Nancy Brown Laser, ran for governor in Ohio

12

as the Socialist Worker Party candidates.

13

Laser received 95,000 votes in Ohio’s 1974 gubernatorial

14

election.

15

other major party candidate, John Gilligan, by 13,500

16

votes in Ohio’s 1974 gubernatorial election.

Nancy Brown

Jim Rhodes beat the other candidate, the

17

Obviously, Nancy Laser had a very important

18

impact on the outcome of our gubernatorial election.

19

a mere 12 percent of the people who voted for this

20 minority party candidate,
21

If

12 percent of the minorty

party candidate’s votes, if those would have been

22 switched to John Gilligan, he would have been governor
23

instead of Jim Rhodes, who won by 13,500 votes.

24

party can have more impact on elections than just

25

winning the election.

A minor

We think that is an important

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

thing to take into consideration in this case.
Another example of that is the Ford-Carter

In Ohio, Carter beat Ford by

McCarthy got 58,000.

The

MR. BROWN*

Yes, sir.

how we can connect it if it is that far apart.

2

HR. BROWN;

It is not a matter of connecting so

3 much as a matter of arguing to this Court that a
4 minority party is more than just a winner and a loser.
5 It impacts on elections.

I bring that example out to

6 show you that it did it in Ohio.
7

QUESTION;

General Brown, may I follow up on a

8 question Justice O’Connor asked you a bit ago about the
9 difference between the disclosure requirement with
10 respect to contributions on the one hand and
11 expenditures on the other?

In your reply brief, you say

12 there is nothing to support the order insofar as it
13 relates to expenditures, as I understand the second
14 point of your reply brief.
15

HR. BROWN;

16

QUESTION;

That is basically correct.
I didn't understand you to make that

17 argument in your opening brief, and I am just wondering,
18 was that squarely argued to the district court, that
19 distinction between the two?
20

HR. BROWN;

I don't know that it was squarely

21 argued.

I did not present the argument.

In reviewing

22 the case, it appears that the appellees requested that
23 relief and the state of Ohio disputed it, so in that
24 sense I think it was —

QUESTION;

But did they dispute it in the sense

HR. BROWN:

HR. BROWN* There

was in thesense that the

18 statute be declared unconstitutional on its face, and
19 the trial court refused to do that.

I think in that

20 sense there was a finding of facial unconstitutionality,
21 because the plaintiffs had asked for it, and it was
22 denied.

MR. BROWN*

Specifically?
It is not referenced, but it

regarding the issue of anonymity.

Anonymity in Ohio for

As a matter of fact, it is recognized in

It is not a

For example. Revised Code

Section 3517.13(f) allows up to $100 in cash

10

contributions to be given to any particular candidate.

11

There is no prohibition on giving these anonymously.
Revised Code Section 3517.10(b)(4)(E) provides

12
13

for the giving of $25 contributions at any specific

14

social or fundraising event, and again, contrary to the

15

allegations contained in the appellees* brief, the law

16

does not require someone to attend that social function

17

or that fundraising event merely because they donated

18

the $25.

21

So, again, there is another example of

Revised Code Section 3517.10(c) specifically recognizes

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THQMAS D. BUCKLEY, JR., ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

6

MR. BUCKLEY*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7 please the Court, this case is about the right to
8

exercise First Amendment freedom of association by

9 contributing to the Socialist Workers Party election
10

campaigns in Ohio without having the fact of that

11

financial association or tie with the Socialist Worker

12 Party candidates disclosed to the public.

13

The three-judge court applied the law for the

14 cases like this that this Court announced in 1976 in
15 Buckley against Valeo, and found that under the First
16 Amendment, the Socialist Workers Party campaigns in Ohio
17 were exempt from the Ohio disclosure law.

The

18 three-judge court found on the totality of the
19 circumstances that there was a reasonable probability
20 that compelled disclosure of the contributors* names
21

would lead to threats, reprisals, or harassment from

22 either government officials or private parties.

23

QUESTION*

What evidence is there in the record

24 to support that?

In

22 members of the Socialist Workers Party were fired

7 because they belonged to the Socialist Workers Party.
8

In the state of Ohio, four people lost their jobs

10

Party.

In Ohio, there were about 60 Socialist Workers

11

Party members.

If you translate that 7 percent into

proportions, it means thousands of

13 Democrats, thousands of Republicans would lose their
14 jobs annually in Ohio on account of their political

MR. BUCKLEY:

It is

18 closer to Cleveland than it is Columbus, where this case
19 was tried.

24 into the shape of a cross and set on fire and a
25 candidate's automobile was also set on fire.

How, with respect to this most recent evidence,

2 the state says that all it amounts to is isolated,

It is as if

The state says that the evidence from before —

5

QUESTION*

Hr. Buckley, the offices, I take it,

6 would be attacked quite apart from any disclosure
7 requirement.

I mean, there is a certain — a party

8 chooses to make itself public in a certain sense, open
9 streetfront offices, campaign headquarters, and it
10 doesn't require any statutory disclosure for people to
11

know if you are conducting any sort of a campaign to

12 know where your campaign headquarters are.
13

QUESTION*

None at all. Your Honor.

There is

14 no connection between the disclosure statute and knowing
15 where the Socialist Workers Party office is located.
16 When it comes to evidence of harassment or threats or
17 reprisals on account of disclosure, we have very little
18 evidence of that.
19 from

The reason -- We have some evidence

1973, after 1971, when harassment was supposed to

20_ have stopped.
21

In

*

1973, the FBI looked up and found out that

22 some individual had contributed ?10 to a Socialist
23 Workers Party campaign, had displayed a
24 of the Socialist

poster in favor

Workers Party and had recommended that

25 people vote either for the Socialist Workers Party or

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

for somebody else.

The FBI confronted that person, told

2 that person that they knew what he was up to, and they
3

were going to keep an eye on him in the future.

4
5

The reason there is so little evidence, direct
evidence, is that there hasn't been any disclosure to

6 speak of.
7

There has been no disclosure in this case,

and the Socialist Workers Party has prevailed in six

8 courts or administrative tribunals around the country
9

when they have made the same sort of case that we are

10

making right here.

11

QUESTION*

Of course, in a sense, it was

12

something that you brought about yourself.

13

you had wanted evidence and thought it would be

14

forthcoming by application of the disclosure statute,

15

you could have refrained from asking for the temporary

16

restraining order over a period of six years.

17

HR. BUCKLEY*

I mean, i.f

Well, Your Honor, in Buckley

18

against Valeo, we think that that opinion invited

19

exactly this sort of a lawsuit to be brought when there

20 was evidence based upon past or present harassment of

members, and it doesn't require that there be a direct

22 cause and effect relationship.
23

13 that there is a reasonable probability, which is a

Your Honor, what we —

We can’t make an — you submit that

25

MR. BUCKLEY;

Rule 52 says that the findings in

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

matters like this of the trial court should not be set

2 aside unless they are clearly erroneous.

Now, the

3 record, we think, is so powerful and overwhelming that
4 even if the court were to conduct the trial de novo, in
5 effect, on the record evidence, this Court would verify
6 the decision that the trial court made, but Rule 52, the

7 Pullman Standard case last year, we think, is
8 appropriate and applies here.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Buckley, was there any evidence

10

in the record as to the effect on disclosure of

11

expenditures?

12

MR. BUCKLEY:

There is no evidence in the

13 record on expenditures either. Your Honor, because with
14 no disclosure —
15

QUESTION:

Hell, there is some limited

16 evidence, is your argument, as to the effect on
17 contributors, but is there any at all on the
18 expenditures?
19

MR. BUCKLEY:

There is none at all on

20 expenditures as such, but in that connection, we think
21

that the considerations when it comes to disclosure of

22 who gets the money, where the disbursements go, are very

23 similar to the considerations that go into the
24 contributors' names.
25

QUESTION:

to discourage the payment of

bribes or buying votes, or something of that kind?
MR. BUCKLEY:

I wouldn’t see that that is any

greater interest, Your Honor.

13 than the interests that support contribution

hot, and it is just a very bitter, hostile rivalry, with

2

a lot of rockthrowing, things you don't ordinarily see

3 in strictly major party campaigns, but this is a little
4

bit different.
Do you suppose that either the Republican

5
6

candidate or the Democratic candidate or the Republican

7

Party or the Democratic could come in and make a showing

8 under those circumstances that they ought not to be

9

reguired to disclose?

10

MR. BUCKLEY:

11

Well, Your Honor, it might

theoretically be possible.

It is hard to imagine the

12 circumstances in which that would take place.

In

13 Buckley, the Court said that minor parties could get an
14 exemption.

Now, there are places and circumstances, I

15 suppose, in which a Democrat hasn't won or a Republican
16 hasn't won in 100 years, and perhaps one could generate
17 out of that sort of background a minor party
18 characterization.

12 sort of evidence that the Court in

This is exactly the
Buckley against Valeo

13 said would be necessary for a minor party to qualify for
14 an exemption from a campaign disclosure law.
15

This is also exactly the sort of evidence about

16 the dangers of being associated

with the Socialist

17 Workers Party which establishes that it is dangerous to
18 have your name identified as a person to whom an
19 expenditure has been made.

People who receive

20 expenditures, not only printers, but landlords, other
21

such people, are just as apt — the inference seems just

22 so perfectly natural.

They are just as apt to be

23 harassed on that account as are people who make

MR. BUCKLEY*

deliberately choose to deal with them, and they might

12 very well not want it to be known that that is where
13 they were making their money.

QUESTION*

14

The same for the printers.

Well, I suppose any landlord

15 deliberately chooses, but do you think it is exactly the
16 same sort of choice as making a

voluntary contribution

17 to a political party?

MR. BUCKLEY*

I suggest that it would be

19 harmful to many people if it were known that they were

QUESTIONS

Any evidence of hostility from the

9 state of Ohio?
10

MR. BUCKLEYs

Very little. Your Honor, but

11

there is some.

The lieutenant governor made a request

12

to the FBI in one situation about a member of the Young

13 Socialist Alliance, and it shows at another point that
14 the FBI was working with the Cleveland Police
15 Department,

but there isn't that much.

And in NAACP,

16 there is some evidence, but not as much evidence as
17 there is in this case, of economic reprisal.

When it

18 comes to people being fired we have in this case a
19 substantial amount of evidence coming right down to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY ELSON BROWN, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - REBUTTAL

10
11

MR. BROWN*

Chief Justice, and if it please the

Court, we just have a couple of brief points we would

12 like to make on rebuttal in regard to

two t specific cases

13 which have been previously decided in this country.
14

One of them is the Paul Young case involving

15 the Socialist Workers Party.

In that case, the

16 Soclialist Workers Party lost.

The district court

17 required the Socialist Workers Party to disclose the
18 identity of its contributors and the recipients of its
19 expenditures, yet in this case,

the SWP has presented no

20 evidence of any harassment in Oregon, despite the fact
21

that they present extensive other evidence of nationwide

22 problems in
23

the evidence in their case.

Again, I think they could have presented direct

24 evidence on the question regarding potential harassment
25 of contributors or expenditure recipients out of the

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1

Oregon situation if there had been any harassment,

2 threats, or reprisals.
3

The other case we would like to refer to

4 briefly is the FEC versus Hall Tiner case, which Hr.
5 Buckley just brought to the Court's attention in his
6 letter this week.

That case involves the Communist

7 Party rather than the Socialist Workers Party, but that
8 case is a very telling case, because the evidence there
9 showed, and incidentally, the Court created an exemption
10 for the Communist Party in the FEC case, and the
11 evidence in that case showed that there are numerous
12 federal statutes currently subjecting members of the
13 Communist Party to both civil disabilities and criminal
f

14 liability.
15

Secondly, membership can cause a naturalized

16 citizen to have his citizenship revoked.

The evidence

17 also showed that in many states it is currently illegal
18 to be a member of the communist party.
19

Fourth, contributors to the Communist Party are

20 proscribed by many state statutes throughout the
21 country, and most importantly, there was evidence in the
22 form of an affidavit by the Assistant Director of the
23 FBI that even though the Cointelpro, the harassment
CM

V

program of the FBI, even though the Cointelpro Program

25 was terminated in 1971, the Communist Party of the

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

United States is currently under active surveillance.

2

That is very distinguishable from this case#

3

where the government has testified that there is no

4

longer any Cointelpro Programs vis-a-vis the Socialist

5

Workers Party.

They are not under active surveillance

6 in this country.

QUESTION;

7

Hr. Brown, time-wise, where does the

8 line of demarcation come?
9
10

Suppose the FBI had announced

last week that it was terminating?

Is the case any

different?
HR. BROWN;

11

Justice Blackmun, there is no way

12

for me to stand here and say there is a definite way to

13

draw that time line.

14

or this Court has to bring its experience to bear on

15

that question, but last week is a far cry, ten or eleven

16

years ago, and the issue coming out of the Buckley

17

versus Valeo test is the future reasonable probability

18

that disclosure is going to result in threats,

19

reprisals, or harassment.

A three-judge panel or trial court

If it just ceased last week,

20 I think that would be a different case than we have
21

here, where it ceased eleven years ago.
QUESTION;

22
23

Well, suppose it is three years

ago .
HR. BROWN;

Well, like I say, there is no way

to definitely draw the line, but the further you go back

51

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ME. BROWNs

I don't understand about have to be

QUESTIONS

The conclusions of the three-judge

court have to be unreasonable on the evidence that was

9 submitted.

If it is eleven years ago, it is

10 unreasonable.
11

MR. BROWNs

That’s correct.

There is no doubt

12 about that.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. BROWNs

If it was three years ago —
If it was three years ago, I would

15 stand here and say it was probably still unreasonable.
16 Last week,
17

I would be much less prone to say that.

Your Honor, in closing, I think clearly in

18 consideration of this matter, the district court
19 incorrectly applied the standards set forth by this
20 Court in Buckley versus Valeo by failing to require the
V

21

Socialist Workers Party to properly establish that a

22 reasonable probability in the future of threats,
23 reprisals, or harassment to contributors or recipients
24 of expenditures would result from their compliance with
25 the disclosure requirements of our statute.
