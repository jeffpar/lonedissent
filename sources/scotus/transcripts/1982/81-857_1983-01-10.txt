ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD J. TUDDENHAM, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr.

MR. TUDDENHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is in many respects a companion case

10

to last term's decision in Plyler versus Doe.

11

another attempt by the state of Texas to exclude

12

unwanted Mexican children from the schools of Texas, and

13

to deter them from migrating to the state.

14

It is

What the state does here is far less

15

defensible than what it did in Plyler versus Doe.

16

children that the state is depriving of an education in

17

this case are, in fact. United States citizens.

18

Citizens whose parents are Mexican nationals.

19

citizen children have an absolute constitutional right

20

to establish their homes in the United States.

21

The

But these

And the mechanism used by the state to exclude

22

these children from school is to define them as

23

non-residents.

24

child who lives apart from his parents for the purpose

25

of obtaining an education is a non-resident if he is

The statute at issue here states that a

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

moved apart from his parents in order to obtain an

2

education.

3

QUESTIONS

Mr. Tuddenham, where in your brief

4

is that statute set out?

5

MR. TUDDENHAM;

It is set out — Your Honor» I

6

believe it’s on page 2 of the brief.

7

(d), the section challenged here.

8

9

It's subsection

But of course, it's precisely children like
Roberto Morales and other children whose parents are

10

Mexican nationals who must move apart from their parents

11

in order to obtain the education they need if they are

12

to participate in American society and exercise their

13

birthright, their American citizenship.

14

QUESTION;

Well certainly, the statute can

15

serve some legitimate purposes, can't it?

16

suppose that wealthy parents can live in a poor school

17

district that doesn't do much in the way of taxing

18

property and have a constitutional right to have their

19

child live with a step-sister in a very wealthy school

20

district.

21

MR. TUDDENHAM;

I don't

Well, there are several

22

answers to that.

23

one district to another and, in fact, returns at night

24

to live with its parents, then —

25

If the child is simply commuting from

QUESTION;

No, I'm assuming that the parents

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

don't want to pay the school taxes in the high taxing

2

district, but they want their child to be educated there

3

and they're perfectly willing to have the child take up

4

legal residence with a step-sister.

5

MR. TUDDENHAM:

If the child, in fact, moves

6

and establishes a residence with a sister in another

7

school district and residence is the criteria for

8

admission to school, then I should think that that child

9

would have the right to attend school.

10

But I would

point out that this statute does more than that.
The problem with the example you're giving —

11
12

and I think it is the essential problem of the case —

13

is this notion that if a child has a choice between two

14

districts, there's something somehow wrong with him

15

choosing one district over another.

16

problem aside for the moment, that's not what this

17

statute prohibits.
QUESTION:

18

Well, setting that

But doesn't the state have a

19

perfectly legitimate interest in seeing that what you

20

say the statute doesn't prohibit doesn't happen?
MR. TUDDENHAM:

21

The state has an interest in

22

protecting its schools from excessive problems of

23

migration, but it can't do that by prohibiting

24

migration.

25

is really more in the minds of the school administrators

And I think that the problem that you pose

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

than the evidence in this case would demonstrate.

2

fact, several states such as New York, Pennsylvania, New

3

Jersey and Connecticut, and I also believe Colorado,

4

have statutes that would allow parents to do just what

5

you have said in your example here.

6

QUESTION*

In

But the fact that New York and

7

Pennsylvania might allow parents to do this doesn’t mean

8

that Texas, under the Constitution, has to allow it,

9

does it?
MR. TUDDENHAMs

10

Well, I would argue that if

11

the child has a right to travel and a right to establish

12

his home in another district, then he can.

13

QUESTION*

But —

You would argue, then, that if I'm

14

a parent and live in a very wealthy school district and

15

my 14-year old child — rather, I’m a parent who lives

16

in a poor district but I want my child to go to a

17

district where there is a good deal better education

18

because of a high tax rate but I don’t want to move into

19

that district because I don't want to pay the high tax

20

rate, so I simply farm my child out to a step-sister in

21

the high tax rate district, that the state can’t prevent

22

that under the Constitution, because a 14-year old child

23

has a right to travel from one school district to

24

another?

25

MR. TUDDENHAM*

To establish a new home, yes.

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

But, Your Honor, understand that in this case, Texas

2

doesn’t prohibit what you're saying.

3

QUESTION;

Do you think the child has a right,

4

independent of the parent, if the child is

5

unemancipated, to establish his own residency

6

independenly?

7

MB. TUDDENHAW;

Perhaps, again, where there is

8

a choice between school districts, there might be some

9

grounds for limitation, although I think if there are

10

going to be limitations on a child's constitutional

11

rights as opposed to an adult’s, it must have something

12

intrinsic to do with the child, some disability of the

13

child.

14

But the state of Texas has made clear that it

15

does not care whether'children move from one district to

16

another to live with a sister, so long as they can come

17

up with some other reason for doing it.

18
19
20

QUESTION;

And —

What is the general test of

residency for school purposes in Texas?
MB. TUDDENHAM;

The only test for school

21

residency in Texas is de facto residence.

22

requirement of prior residence, there's no requirement

23

of intent to remain.

24

in the district, and that goes —

25

QUESTION;

There is no

All you have to do is be present

What do you cite for that?

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. TUDDENHAM:

Well, the statute itself

2

simply refers to residence, but last year in Plyler

3

versus Doe the state argued that — I believe the

4

example was someone coming from Virginia for six months

5

could bring their child and stay for six months with the

6

fixed intention to return to Virginia, and during that

7

six months they would be —

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. TUDDENHAM;

Other than the arguments in Plyler.
There is also evidence in the

10

record. Your Honor, in the school applications that were

11

submitted as Plaintiff's Exhibit 8.

12

of examples there.

13

There are a number

The one that comes to my mind right now is one

14

of a mother who sent her child to live with a

15

grandmother in south Texas for a few months.

16

some problem; the mother just couldn’t take care of the

17

child at that moment, but was going to come and take the

18

child back to Houston in December after one semester.

19

That child was admitted as a resident.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

There was

What do you say the state does

prohibit that it can't?
MR. TUDDENHAM;

What it prohibits is — the

23

state says that a child can establish residence apart

24

from its parent or guardian for any reason it wants to.

25

So they have no problem with the capacity of the child

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to establish residence apart from its parent.

2

then takes one class of those children and says you

3

cannot establish residence apart from your parents

4

because you've come for the purpose of obtaining an

5

education.

6

It simply

And to go back to your question# Justice

7

Rehnquist, the fact that the state may have a legitimate

8

concern about children district-hopping, I believe is

the way the respondents referred to it, this statute

10

doesn’t stop that.

11

obtain a guardianship, or if he can concoct a reason

12

other than the need for an education, then the child can

13

transfer.

14

QUESTION:

If a parent has enough money to

Yes, but I suppose if

15

district-hopping is what they want they may have a tough

16

time coming up with a phony reason that passes muster.

17

MR. TUDDENHAMi

Hell, the district court found

18

that any reason would suffice; any reason other than the

19

desire to obtain an education.

20

QUESTION:

But if, in fact, the reason is the

21

desire to obtain an education, I suppose that whoever

22

decides whether the reason is true or not would make

23

some inquiry into that.

24
25

MR. TUDDENHAM:

Well, there is inquiry into

what is your purpose for being here.

And if the purpose

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

-- very often, in moving from one district to another,

2

from one state to another, that purpose may represent

3

educational needs as desperate as Roberto Morales'.

4

What has happened here is Roberto Morales has

5

no other school that he can attend.

6

precluded from choosing one district over another.

7

QUESTION:

He is not being
He —

Counsel, may I ask you a question?

8

Are you making a facial attack on this statute, or as

9

applied to a particular client?

10

MS. TUDDENHAM:

Well, in the district court ve

11

amended our complaint to drop the claim that the statute

12

is being discriminatorily applied.

13
14

QUESTION:

statute has been applied discriminatorily, are you?

15
16

MR. TUDDENHAM:

That is correct.

But on its

face, —
QUESTION:

17
18

So you're not arguing that the

And Judge Garza found as a fact

that it was not being so applied, didn't he?
MR. TUDDENHAM:

19

I believe his finding was that

20

if you had any other reason for getting in, they would

21

let you in.

22

that —

23
24
25

There was no statistical evidence to show

QUESTION:

He didn't find any discriminatory

enforcement, did he?
MR. TUDDENHAM:

That was not presented to

him.

done of the school applications to show that children

3

coming from Mexico were excluded more frequently than

4

children coming from other states or —

5

That issue did not come up.

QUESTION;

There was no analysis

But on the face of the statute, it

6

applies equally to children coming from Mexico as it

7

would to children coming from any other school district

8

in the state, wouldn’t it?

9

MR. TUDDENHAM;

Absolutely, it does.

But the

10

legislative history makes clear that the purpose for

11

this statute was to deter migration.

12

control inter-district transfers.

13

migration from Mexico, to keep children whose parents

14

cannot entar the country from coming here because

15

they’re citizens and obtaining an education.

16

QUESTION;

It was not to

It was to deter

Counsel, I was going to ask exactly

17

the same question, because I think the record for me is

18

somewhat confusing as to whether you were making a

19

facial or an as-applied challenge, and I take it your

20

answer to Justice Powell is that now you’re making a

21

facial challenge.

22
23
24
25

MR. TUDDENHAM;

It is a facial challenge, but

on its face —■
QUESTION;

What do you do, then, about the

boarding house situation?

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ME. TUDDENHAM:

Boarding home situation?

The

2

state could deal with that if that is a problem.

3

state could deal with that in any number of less

4

restrictive ways.

5

reasonable assumption that who is providing the care and

6

clothing for the child is — in other words, who’s

7

supporting the child — is a legitimate criteria to look

8

at to determine the child's residence.

9

The

Many states, for instance, make the

And that would be a far less broad definition,

10

and it would take care of the boarding home problem

11

because, of course, the boarding home would be a

12

commercial operation receiving pay from the parents.

13

QUESTIONi

Does the record show that this

14

petitioner intends to stay in the United States after

15

he’s been educated?
ME. TUDDENHAM:

16

The record states that he

17

intended to stay until he completed his high school

18

education.

19

Morales was nine years old and didn't really know what

20

he wanted to do.

21

he wanted to grow up and be a doctor and live in McAllen.

When we submitted that evidence, Eoberto

Last week when I talked to him he said

QUESTION;

22

Well, this takes us right back to

23

the question I think that was implicit in something that

24

Justice O’Connor asked.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MB. TUDDENHAMj

I think this has to be looked

2

at — it's a family situation.

3

is nine, Roberto Morales may or may not have known what

4

was in his best interest.

5

recognized that since he was a United States citizen and

6

he was going to live in the United States as an adult,

7

he had to learn how to speak English.

8

wait until he was 18 and could make up his mind to move

9

to the United States and learn English then, because by

10

Obviously, when a child

His parents, I think,

And he couldn't

then it would be too late.
These people are indigent and they cannot

11
12

simply move at age 18 and start adult education

13

classes.

14

he was nine who, as a family, made the sacrifice to send

15

their child away so that his life would not be forever

16

stigmatized by the fact that he did not learn what it

17

was to be an American citizen.

18
19
20

So his parents were the ones, I imagine, when

QUESTIONi

I suppose it's irrelevant, but how

did he happen to be born in the United States?
MB. TUDDENHAMj

That is not in the record,

21

although the way this comes up is the parents are either

22

here temporarily — Mexican parents are either in Texas

23

temporarily on visas or they're here illegally.

24

when the child is born in the United States, he then

25

becomes a U.S. citizen.

But

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

And that brings up an important comparison

2

between this case and Plyler, because I think what’s

3

going on hare, what was in the minds — or what the

4

legislative history indicates — is that the reason

5

these children are being excluded from school is the

6

notion that somehow, they really aren't U.S. citizens.

7

That they were born here because their parents managed

8

to get across the river, and for that reason, they can

9

be deprived of the education that is made available to

10

11

all other citizens of Texas.
QUESTIONS

What would be your argument if the

12

child was not a citizen.

13

HR. TUDDENHAMx

Well, if he were entering,

14

say, on a visa, say, if the federal government had

15

granted him a permanent residence visa —

16
17
18

QUESTION;

No, not permanent.

Suppose they

just let him in to get an education.
MR. TUDDENHAHs

Well, if he came in legally,

19

under the federal immigration laws I should think that

20

there would be a supremacy problem for the state then --

21

22

QUESTION;

Well, you'd be making the same

argument, wouldn’t you?

23

MR. TUDDENHAMs

If he had entered legally I

24

would be making the same argument.

25

the additional argument that if the federal government,

Now, there would be

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in its exercise of its powers of immigration, had

2

decided that it was all right for this child to enter

3

the country, then the state could not burden that right

4

by then saying well, you can come into the country, but

5

if you’ve gotten permission to come in to go to school

6

we’re not going to let you in the school.

7

8

QUESTIONS

So the fact that this child is a

citizen is rather irrelevant, isn’t it?

9

MB. TUDDENHAMs

Only that his right is not a

10

supremacy right of immigration; it’s that he is a

11

citizen.

12

this country and live here.
QUESTION*

13
14

He has a right under the Constitution to enter

argument.

Hell, it’s irrelevant to your

I'm sure it's not irrelevant generally.
MB. TUDDENHAMs

15

Well, perhaps if he is

16

entering illegally for the purpose of attending school,

17

the state could draw a narrower statute to exclude those

18

children.

19

QUESTIONt

Under Plyler?

20

MB. TUDDENHAM:

Hell, there is a footnote in

21

Justice Powell’s concurrence with respect to if the

22

child is entering for the purpose of attending school,

23

then you could make a pretty good logical argument that

24

excluding him would be consistent with the federal

25

policy of deterring immigration.

That is, if he's

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

coming by himself because they’re the only children

2

being affected by this statute.

3

But his citizenship is what gives him the

4

right to come into the country, and that right -- what

5

I’m arguing is that that right cannot be conditioned

6

because the state doesn’t approve of his reason for

7

coming here.

8
9

QUESTION;

To what extent do you rely on a

constitutional right to travel?

10

MR. TUDDENHAM;

It is our argument that this

11

case should be reversed based on the same equal

12

protection analysis utilized in Doe v. Plyler.

13

here, this Court should apply strict scrutiny because it

14

is his fundamental right to travel that is being

15

burdened, in addition to the fact that he is being

16

deprived of an education.

17

QUESTION;

But

So you must be taking the position

18

that a child of three, four, five, six years of age has

19

the same constitutional right to travel as an adult

20

citizen.

21

MR. TUDDENHAM;

Obviously, children’s rights,

22

to a certain extent, are not co-extensive with an

23

adult’s rights.

24

there is no reason shown in this record for limiting

25

Roberto Morales’ right to travel.

But what I would submit here is that

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The state of Texas has already decided under

2

its probate code that there is a responsible adult

3

taking care of him.

His sister is perfectly okay with

4 * the state of Texas.

If he is moving from Louisiana or

5

from Peru, if he comes and lives with his sister, the

6

state of Texas thinks that's just fine, as long as he

7

isn't coming for the purpose of attending school.

8

So there's nothing intrinsic about the fact
/

9
10

that he is a child that argues that his right to travel
should be —

11

QUESTION:

Texas doesn't object to the right

12

to travel back to Mexico, does it?

MB. TUDDENHAM;

No, it does not. Your Honor.

14

In fact, that's precisely what the state of Texas

15

suggests.

best interest of the child, to give up living with his

2

parents, give up the day-to-day — the parents giving up

3

control over the day-to-day upbringing of their child,

4

then I would think that there would be a strong argument

5

that the state would have to show a compelling interest

6

to interfere with that choice.

7

However, that's not the case here.

Also, I

8

would point out that this statute does not stop that in

It only stops that for indigents.

11

only to indigents?

12

MR. TUDDENHAM;

No, it applies to all.

I'm

simply pointing out that what your — the concern of the

Court in terms of people choosing districts is going on

every day right now for everyone but indigents.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. ARNETT, Esq.

7

8

MR. ARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

9

I think first we probably ought to straighten

10

out the history of this provision.

It was codified in

11

1977; however, this is a rule of Texas law that dates

12

back at least to 1905.

13

dates back at least to 1851 in what was apparently the

14

first school residence case in the nation.

15

introduced into jurisprudence by the New Hampshire

16

Supreme Court at that time.

It's a rule of American law that

It was

In 1905, the Texas attorney general's opinion

17
18

expressly relied on this rule, stating that the child

19

was not entitled to go to school in a little town called

20

Rockdale in central Texas if the main purpose of the

21

child being there was to obtain an education in that

22

district, and this child did not live with parents or

23

guardians.

24
25

He equated the main purpose of being there for
an education with an ostensible residence as opposed to

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

substantial residence.
Just to show the dissimilarity of this rule of

3

law with the rule of law at issue in Plyler versus Doe,

4

some 15 years later while this rule was still in effect

5

in Texas, the Texas attorney general ruled that they

6

also had to admit any illegal aliens in the school.

7

didn't matter — and you’ll find that in the record of

8

the Plyler case, reference to that 1920 decision in the

9

1975 opinion of the attorney general.

10

It

In 1973, this question recurred -- the

11

question in this instant case -- recurred several times,

12

right on up until 1973 where the attorney general

13

reviewed all the decision up to date and reiterated that

14

the test for residence in Texas to go to school is not

15

domicile, it's not an intent to remain permanently, it's

16

what is termed a bona fide residence, and a bona fide

17

residence can be acquired apart from a parent or

18

guardian if your purpose for residing in that district

19

and being present in that district is not for the

20

primary purpose of going to school.

21

And Justice O'Connor, that is the Texas test

22

of residency and has been now for 77 years at least.

For school purposes.

education?

MR. ARNETT:

Not if your primary purpose is to

13

obtain an education.

14

happens to be that you need to be there for some other

15

reason, — let's say health; you need to go down to

16

Texas for treatment for six months -- then yes, you

would be admitted to school.

20

superintendent of education at that time, back in 1905.

Appeals for Corpus Christi said that that was really

2

QUESTION;

What if parents decide that they

3

like the public schools in Corpus Christi, Texas and

4

they decide to move from New Mexico to Corpus Christi,

5

Texas so their children can attend the public schools

6

there, and for no other purpose.

7
8

MR. ARNETT:

Is that all right?

Yes, Your Honor, that is all

right.

9

QUESTION:

Because they're with their parents.

MR. ARNETT:

10

Yes, Your Honor, because when

11

their parents move into that district as a family unit

12

on another situation where a child resides with the

13

guardian — and the reason we have a guardianship

14

provision is some children need to have guardians.

15

Application for guardianship in Texas has to specify the

16

necessity for a guardian's appointment, so it's not at

17

all clear that the statute can be frustrated in the

18

method contemplated and suggested by the petitioner.
But getting back to your question, you have a

I don't really think that the ability of the

don't really believe that's one of the major

underpinnings of the statute — whether or not the child
