ORAL ARGUMENT OF MISS BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MISS UNDERWOOD:

6
7

Miss Underwood, you may

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

8

The issue in this case is whether a state criminal

9

defendant is entitled to federal habeas corpus relief on the

10

grounds that his assigned appellate counsel failed to raise

11

every non-frivolous issue requested by the Defendant.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held

12
13

that he is and created a pro se rule that appellant counsel is

14

automatically ineffective if he fails to raise an issue that

15

meets two tests.

16

slight; and, two, it was requested by the Defendant on a very

17

generous construction of the term "request.

One, it has some possible merit, however

That decision is wrong for several reasons.

18

It upsets

19

state convictions without any showing of prejudice to the

20

Defendant.

21

law or sound judicial administration.

22

than promoting effective assistance of appellate counsel, and it

23

is an unmanageable, unworkable rule that requires courts to

24

probe the attorney-client relationship after the fact and

25

distinguish requests that would trigger the rule from suggestions

It is not required by any principle or constitutional

or discussions or things mentioned in passing that would not.
QUESTION:

2

May I ask a preliminary question?

The

3

question presented in the cert petition is whether the 6th

4

and 14th Amendments require assigned defense counsel to raise

5

every non-frivolous issue requested by the Defendant.
What I would like to ask is whether the questions,

6
7

whether the Respondent, in fact, asked his lawyer to raise the

8

issues and whether they were non-frivolous are questions before

9

us?

10
11

The briefs talk about them a lot but it was hard for me to

understand that those questions were properly here.
MISS UNDERWOOD:

Well, the question — whether a

12

particular question is non-frivolous, being a question of law,

13

it seems to me, is necessarily before this Court and the

14

predicate for determining whether the rule stated by the Second

15

Circuit is — was appropriately announced in this case.

16

The question of whether a request was made is in part

17

a factual question and while that matter is discussed at some

18

length in the brief,it is unnecessary for this Court to explore

19

the intricacies of the attorney-client relationship and decide

20

whether a request was made in the ordinary sense of that term.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Should we just assume that requests were

made and get on with the other issues?
MISS UNDERWOOD:

Yes, except for this point.

The

24

Second Circuit gave a particular meaning to request, and it

25

would be misleading to understand the Second Circuit rule as
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

applying only to that case in which there was a square conflict

2

between attorney and client in which an explicit request was

3

made and that request was refused.
The Second Circuit's definition of request for purposes

4
5

of its rule encompasses much more.
QUESTION:

6

But, nevertheless, they predicated their

7

bottom line on the grounds that in their understanding there

8

had been a request?
MISS UNDERWOOD:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MISS UNDERWOOD:

Well, they found —

As a matter of fact, an insistence.
Well, they characterized what had

12

happened as a request and as an insistence, that is correct.

13

They also recite what they imply that from.

14

be said that what they found was an implied request and implied

15

insistence.
QUESTION:

16

Well, since so much seems to turn on this,

17

Miss Underwood, could you briefly summarize

18

happen?

19

It must at least

MISS UNDERWOOD:

Yes.

what, in fact, did

What the record shows is that

20

before appellate counsel was appointed, the Defendant drafted

21

a pro se brief which included a number of issues.

22

appellate counsel was appointed, he sent that brief to counsel.

23

There was some correspondence between Defendant and counsel in

24

the course of which a number of issues were discussed.

25

After his

The record includes a letter from counsel to the
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Defendant which says, I have considered these various issues,

2

and I believe that none of them are supported by the record?

3

however, here are seven more issues which I am thinking about

4

raising.

5

6
7

And ultimately counsel filed a brief which included
three issues from counsel's list of seven.
He also filed Defendant's original pro se brief.

8

Defendant drafted another pro se brief which included some more

9

of the issues from counsel's list and those too were before the

10
11

Appellate Division.
So,

there was much discussion between attorney and

12

client about issues.

13

constitute a request.

14

That is what the Second Circuit found to

I should say that the record is sufficient to show

15

that the Defendant — That counsel's performance satisfied

16

both the farce and mockery standard for effective assistance of

17

counsel and the more demanding standard of reasonable professiona

18

competence.

19

The District Court, the Second Circuit, and this Court

20

have before it all these various briefs, which are in the Joint

21

Appendix and that excerpt from the attorney-client correspondence

22

that I have described, all of that is sufficient to show that

23

counsel painstakingly reviewed the issues and made a reasonable

24

selection of them, giving attention to Defendant's concerns.

25

If this Court were to find some possible merit in the
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Second Circuit's pro se request rule, it should, nevertheless,

2

reverse rather than remand in this case because of the extra­

3

ordinarily broad notion of requests that satisfied the Second

4

Circuit.

5

A hearing in the District Court would be necessary,

6

which is what this discussion about the record suggests, only

7

if this Court were to adopt the extraordinary rule that the

8

omission by counsel of any issue mentioned in communication

9

between attorney and client raised a rebuttable presumption

10

of ineffective assistance and then a hearing would be necessary

11

to permit the state an opportunity to rebut the presumption

12

and inquire into the nature of communications between attorney

13

and client and discover why particular issues were or were not raised.

14

But, since it is our position that that rule in not what the

15

Constitution requires, no further exploration of the facts is

16

necessary.

17

The Second Circuit's rule requires counsel to suppress

18

professional judgment and simply transmit arguments to the court

19

instead of submitting a brief that counsel believes would be

20

most effective.

21

22
23

The Second Circuit suggested that this was a natural
extension of Anders, this Court's decision in Anders, but,
in fact, this decision — and this situation is totally different

24

from the situation in Anders — that governs the situation where

25

counsel finds no meritorious issues and his professional

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

judgment would lead him to withdraw the appeal.

2

this Court held that counsel must set forth the possible issues

3

any way even though he regards them as lacking in merit.

4

In that case,

The Anders defendant doesn't lose the benefit of

5

professional judgment because counsel's professional judgment

6

would be of no benefit to him.

7

By contrast, in a case like this one, where counsel

8

has a strategy for effective presentation of the appeal, then

9

the Second Circuit rule would suppress that strategy and

10

require counsel to replace it with a laundry-list brief, with a

11

brief simply listing what may well be a large number of issues

12

which, in counsel's judgment, would render the brief less

13

effective rather than more.

14

Such a list of issues which Anders, in fact, requires

15

may be better than nothing which is what the Anders defendant

16

would otherwise get, but it was not better or more effective

17

than a carefully constructed presentation based on reasonable,

18

professional judgment.

19

The selection of issues for appeal is plainly a

20

strategic judgment, the sort of strategic judgment appropriately

21

assigned to counsel, and not one of the small number of

22

decisions that are appropriately reserved for the Defendant

23

personally.

24
25

The number of colorable issues that could be found
in combing a record is potentially infinite.

Is there any

Does the client have any kind of issue on which

10

he could insist that there be an argument made or an argument

11

not made either way?

12

MISS UNDERWOOD:

Yes, I think there might well be.

13

I would say that the omission of a particular issue might well

14

constitute ineffective assistance of appellate counsel either

15

because that issue was itself so strong that any reasonable

16

lawyer would raise it or because the client's particular reasons

17

for wanting that particular issue raised were so compelling

18

that they ought to overcome whatever strategic judgment the

19

lawyer might otherwise make.

20

My objection rather is to this pro se rule that makes

21

a request despositive of the issue of ineffective assistance of

22

counsel without the sort of case-by-case inquiry that seems

23

to me most appropriate for adjudicating claims of ineffective

24

assistance by counsel.

25

QUESTION:

Do you think if a lawyer refuses to appeal

on an issue that the client insists on would ever be a ground

2

for complaining against him on ethical grounds, not on com­

petency grounds, just on the basis that the client should be

in control of such decisions rather than the lawyer?

It might well be.

It specifically says

that strategic decisions are for the client — for the lawyer
and fundamental decisions are for the client.

The Code says,

for instance--the disciplinary rule says that a lawyer shall
not intentionally fail to seek the lawful objectives of his
client through reasonably available means.

It also says, where

permissible, a lawyer may exercise his professional judgment
to waive or fail to assert a right or position of that client.
It seems pretty clear, in short, that there is some
concern about just how to resolve this question as a matter of
ethics, as a matter of professional responsbility and particularly
in light of that ambiguity.

It seems that the Constitution can

hardly be expected to resolve that difference of professional
opinion which is to say, Justice White, that even if it were
to be determined that there might be an ethical violation
here, that would not dispose of the constitutional question.

QUESTION:

Miss Underwood, what would the effect be

in your view if we were to agree with your view in the event

the convicted defendant thereafter filed a habeas petition under

one of these theories that his lawyer refused to raise on appeal,

17

and we were faced with the issue of whether there was a waiver

applying the waiver principle then in your view?

20

MISS UNDERWOOD:

Would that be a ground for not

Well, I would say that in the

21

ordinary case that would

constitute

a

waiver; that is that

22

reasonable strategic judgments of a lawyer do, in fact, bind

23

the client and they bind him not only on the direct appeal but

24

also for the purposes of making the procedural waiver.

25

the fact, if it were a fact, that there was this kind of

QUESTION:

lost the appeal in state court, comes into federal habeas court

Ordinarily that would be a bar.

The claim of ineffective assistance of appellate

8
9

counsel, however, would, in our view, not be a valid claim.

10

That would not be reached by the federal habeas court or by

11

any other court if the omission was a reasonable, strategic

12

judgment.

Does that answer your question?

13

QUESTION:

14

(Laughter)

15

Sure.

MISS UNDERWOOD:

The Second Circuit justified its

16

rule in part as unnecessary method of providing equality to

17

indigent defendants.

18

Anders and of all the cases that concern themselves with — in

19

which this Court has concerned itself with the right of an

20

indigent defendant to appointed counsel on appeal.

21

Indeed, that is ultimately the premise of

The rule is not an effective — a necessary or

22

effective way of providing equality to indigent defendants.

23

First, the Constitution does not require the state to make the

24

relationship between an indigent defendant and appointed

25

counsel identical to the relationship between a paying client
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and retained counsel and, in any event, that could not be done.

2

There is, in the nature of a financial relationship, something

3

that cannot be represented except by a financial relationship.
Paying clients have substantial financial constraints

4
5

that indigents do not.

one lawyer has already spent a great deal of time on the case,

and it is expensive to ask one lawyer to research and write on

10

It is expensive to change lawyers after

Many paying clients

seems to assume they have.
Indeed, in the wake of the Barnes decision, the Second

11
12

Circuit decision in this case, our office has received habeas

13

corpus petitions from paying clients who claimed that their

14

retained counsel failed to raise

15

16

under the Barnes decision below; that is to say that at least

17

some paying clients lack the kind of control the Second Circuit

18

rule would give to indigents.

amount of money somebody has available to him is very likely

21

to affect the kind of control he has over his client as well

The right is

A breakdown in the attorney-client relationship might

8

operate to prevent meaningful, effective appellate review, but

9

there is no suggestion that that happened here.

10

Where counsel has consulted with the client and paid

11

attention to his concerns and ultimately made reasonable,

12

strategic judgments about how to frame the appeal, the

13

constitutional right to counsel on appeal is satisfied.

14

There is — The Solicitor General has suggested that

15

there may be a problem about state action in this case.

I think

16

it is clear that there is enough state action in holding a

17

convicted defendant in custody to require that the procedures

18

by which the conviction is obtained and upheld satisfy

19

constitutional standards and that includes the requirement

20

of effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal.

21

But, again, that right, that constitutional right, is a right

22

to meaningful counsel to effective appellate review.

23

this Court has held that that applies — that that may be

24

limited only to the first mandatory appeal and not to subsequent

25

discretionary appeals.

In fact,

But, in this first mandatory state

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

appeal, the requirement is of meaningful counsel and that

2

requirement was satisfied here.
The omission of an issue then could well amount to

3
4

ineffective assistance of counsel, but that judgment shouldn't

5

depend on whether or not the defendant made a request.

6

it would be peculiar to penalize the defendant too ignorant to

7

make a request.

No, Your Honor, it is not.

is whether counsel can act as a barricade to preclude his client

MRS. RIESEL:

MRS. RIESEL:

My responsibility to my client, Your

Honor, would be to explain that view to him and explain the

reasons why I had reached that conclusion.

21

if he were to reject my analysis, I believe my obligation would

be to present that issue.

But, ultimately,

You would put it in — You would feel

to?
MRS. RIESEL:

(Laughter)

17

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

But, you might, you might in doing that

18

neglect oral argument on points that you consider truly important

19

and crucial, is that not so?

20

MRS. RIESEL:

That is true, Your Honor, and that too

21

I would explain to my client and I would urge him — as I might

22

add parenthetically Mr. Melinger did not urge Barnes here

23

that we should relinguish that, but if understanding my arguments

and the reasons for my conclusions he determined that he wanted

that the issue was important to him and the issue were a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

non-frivolous one, I would go forward with it.
QUESTION:

2

How would you determine what is non-frivolous,

3

by some objective standard or what counsel deems it to be as you

4

suggested in your brief?
MRS. RIESEL:

5

Well, Your Honor, this Court in Anders

6

sat down a requirement for making — for counsel initially making

7

that determination and for the courts making the determination

8

of what is non-frivolous.
QUESTION:

9
10
11
12
13

Well, Anders didn't tell you how to go about

it.
MRS. RIESEL:

No, sir, it does not give you a handbook.

But, lawyers and judges must make that decision every day.
When counsel on his own refuses to communicate to the

14

court a legitimate claim requested by his client, counsel

15

functions as a barricade to the hearing.

16
17
18
19

20

QUESTION:

Now you have changed your terms from non-

frivolous to legitimate.
MRS. RIESEL:
it, Your Honor.

I did not mean to change the sense of

Non-frivolous will suffice.

QUESTION:

If it is a legitimate claim, you shouldn't

21

need to be — The lawyer shouldn't need to be urged by the

22

client to present them.

23
24
25

MRS. RIESEL:
Your Honor.

I meant to use the terms interchangeably,

I did not mean to suggest the higher standard.

QUESTION:

Mrs. Riesel, your client did have a brief
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

submitted on his behalf to the state appellate court, did he

2

not?

3

MRS. RIESEL:

4

QUESTION:

By counsel, yes, he did, Your Honor.

So, are you claiming that counsel's

5

performance on the written part of the appellate presentation

6

of briefing fell short of constitutional standard?

7

8
9

MRS. RIESEL:

No, Your Honor, we are not asserting that

the brief that assigned counsel filed was an incompetent brief.
QUESTION:

But, supposing there had been no oral

10

argument, that the case had simply been submitted on the basis

11

of your client's pro se brief and the counsel's brief.

12

you think that the Second Circuit ought to reach the same result

13

as it did in this case?

14

MRS. RIESEL:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Would

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Because the lawyer wouldn't sign his name

to the brief prepared by your client?
MRS. RIESEL:

No, it is not just the refusal to sign

18

his name to the brief, Your Honor, but to assist the client,

19

Mr. Barnes, in the presentation of the issues.

20

skills of a trained advocate will exceed those of a layman m

21

the presentation of the issues; so that Mr. Barnes would still

22

have been denied access if counsel had had, in fact, signed the

23

pro se brief, that that is not enough.

24
25

QUESTION:

Obviously, the

Counsel would have had to retool

the pro se brief to meet these standards?
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MRS. RIESEL:

2

QUESTION:

Exactly that.

Am I correct that the constitutional

3

provision on which you have relied is not the 6th Amendment,

4

not the Due Process Clause and not the Equal Protection Clause,

5

but just the right of access cases?

6

MRS. RIESEL:

Well, we rely on the right of access

7

cases and those, in turn, Your Honor, I believe rely on the due

8

process and equal protection.

QUESTION:

But, in those cases, the prisoner access

to the courts, for example, usually pro se submissions have

been adequate.

And here you did, in fact, get — Your client's

Well, Your Honor, the access cases are

14

not limited only to the prisoner cases.

15

that Griffin and Douglas were also access cases.

16

Of course, we believe

But, I think it is clear from this Court's holding

17

and from logic that an indigent appellant's pro se presentation

18

will not suffice and does not equate to the presentation of

19

counsel and particularly in this regard

20
21

22

QUESTION:

If it doesn't equate, then it is an equal

protection matter, but there is access
MRS. RIESEL:

No, Your Honor, I think that when the

23

Petitioner must proceed pro se, his ability to frame his issues

24

and to present them effectively and fairly to the court is so

25

imputed as to infringe on his access right, particulary when

QUESTION:

But that goes to the presuasive character

of the presentation.

5

6

the court.

But it seems to me that the communication

And that, it seems to me, satisfies the access point.

7

MRS. RIESEL:

8

QUESTION:

9

No, Your Honor —

I do not know of any access case that said

there had been a denial of access when the message gets through,

10

even though it may be poorly written and pro se and all the rest.

11

I understand the equal protection, due process, effective

12

assistance of counsel, but I do not think your access case is

13

really right on the button here.

14

MRS. RIESEL:

Well, Your Honor, I beg to disagree.

I

15

think that the access cases make clear that the client must have

16

the means for — I think the words are — adequate and effective

17

way of presenting his issues.

is there not an undercurrent here of effective representation?

You said the client was entitled to have his pro

I do not think so, Your Honor.

So,

We are

QUESTION:

10

Well, but your point of your argument that

11

you were making was that the counsel had an obligation to take this

12

pro se brief and cast the pro se's points in terms that a lawyer

13

would use with the skill of the advocate, I think you have said.

14

So, doesn't that really draw in, even if in the Freudian sense,

15

the effective assistance of counsel in this case?
MRS. RIESEL:

16
17

I do not think so, Your Honor, because

here counsel refused to do anything.
QUESTION:

18

What if he thought one of them was a dis­

honorable, unethical point, do you think he had an obligation to

raise it any way?

In fact —

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

clear that counsel does not have an obligation in that instance

And, I do not have any quarrell with it.

The significance of issue presentation cannot be lost

MRS. RIESEL:

Given the critical importance of

he choose to exercise it, to participate in the appellate process.

An appeal is a deliberative,

have devoted about four pages and they all deal with effective

assistance of counsel.

14

MRS. RIESEL:

Well, Your Honor, that was in response

to the premise of the Petitioner's argument, namely, that the

lawyer should be and must be in control of the proceedings because

17

he is the only competent representative of the appellant.

18

power of response — and I think it has to be the concern of this

As stated, the client's right to insist on the presen­

he and not his lawyer who will suffer the consequences if the

conviction is affirmed.

10

More particularly, the client will suffer the loss,

11

perhaps for all time, of the ability to present the requested

claim to a reviewing court.

QUESTION:

So, the Chief Justice's question must still

MRS. RIESEL:

The answer —

Was it a constitutional performance?
No, it was an unconstitutional performance.

But, not because of competence?
No, because of a denial of access.

Competent but unconstitutional?
The question of competence does not

control, not participation.

17

Second, every point that the Second Circuit said should

18

have been presented, was, in fact, before the state appellate
