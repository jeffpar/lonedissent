CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRA H. ZALEZNIK, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8

MR. ZALEZNIK;

9

Thank you. Your Honor.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

10
11

Court.

The issue before this Court is whether a

12

municipality is obligated by the Constitution to

3

reimburse a hospital for tl}e cost of medical treatment

4

rendered to a person suspected of a crime.

5

Let me briefly summarize the facts.

6

On September 20th, 1978, the Revere police

7

were called to respond to a reported burglary at a

8

dwelling house in Fevere, Massachusetts.

9

arrived at the scene, observed an individual leaving the

The police

20

home with a suitcase and a pillow-case, and this

21

individual was later identified as one Patrick Kivlin.

22

As a result, the police sought to detain him,

23

and Mr. Kivlin attempted to flee.

After repeated

24

warnings and a warning shot, Mr. Kivlin was shot by a

25

police officer for the City of Revere.

3

QUESTION*

1

That is when the Supreme Judicial

2

Court of Massachusetts said he was under arrest, since

3

that bullet hit him.

4

MR. ZALEZNIK*

Yes, Your Honor, except that

5

the Revere police secured an arrest warrant from the

6

Chelsea District Court, the local court of appropriate

7

jurisdiction.

8

QUESTION*

9

MR. ZALEZNIK;

10

Kivlin was still in the hospital.
QUESTION;

11

Later on.
Later on, after — while Mr.

When they picked him up off the

12

street to take him to the hospital, was he arrested

13

then?

14

MR. ZALEZNIK;

We would submit that he was

15

not, other than in the practical sense that he was

16

incapacitated and could not move away on his own.

17

we would not contend that there is any meaning to

18

custody at that stage.

3ut

As a practical matter, the suspect was in need

19
20

of emergency medical attention, and the police officers

21

for the City of Severe did the appropriate thing, they

22

called an ambulance, the ambulance arrived and took Mr.

23

Kivlin to the emergency ward at Massachusetts General

24

Hospital.

25

QUESTION*

Does the record show why they took

1

him to MGH rather than Boston City?

2

SR. ZALEZNIK;

It does not. Your Honor, except

3

that geographically Massachusetts General Hospital is

4

closer.

MR. ZALEZNIK;

15

Yes, that is correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION;

Does the time of day make the

12

16

It depends upon the time of

distance —

10
11

Not very much.

day, but I believe that as a matter of course --

8
9

Much?

What was the reason for taking him

to MGH, other than closeness in terms of traffic?
MR. ZALEZNIK;

19

I would think no other, Your

20

Honor.

21

regard was exercised by the ambulance driver.

22

I believe that the judgment exercised in this

QUESTION;

The result is that you are imposing

23

this cost on a private hospital in contrast to imposing

24

it on a municipal hospital.

25

MR. ZALEZNIK;

We are not claiming in this

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

litigation,

2

that must bear this burden.

Your Honor, that it is the private hospital

3

We are simply saying, and the issue before

4

this Court is whether or not the city must bear this

5

burden as a matter of constitutional mandate.

6

the burden is -QUESTIONS

7
8

there?

9

it.

Who bears

Aren't you weaseling the words

The city doesn't want any responsibility for

Let somebody else pay for it.
NR. ZALSZNIK;

10

The decision of who pays is

11

necessarily a legislative one, and properly belongs with

12

the legislature or the Congress and not the courts, at

13

least under the circumstances of this particular case.
QUESTION:

14

Hay I ask this question.

As a

15

matter of Federal law, as soon as the person was shot,

16

did the police or the City of Revere have any Federal

17

obligation to him at all; could they just let him lie

18

there?

19

20
21

HR. ZALEZNIK:

No, Your Honor, I would not

con tend that -QUESTION:

What Federal obligation, if any,

22

did they have to the man before they picked him up and

23

took him to the hospital?

24
25

HE. ZALEZNIK:

I believe that the police

officers had the obligation to call the ambulance, to

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

provide him with access to emergency medical attention.

2

QUESTION;

3

constitutional law?

As a matter of Federal

4

HE. ZALEZNIKs

5

QUESTION;

Yes, because I believe --

What if when the ambulance driver

6

picked him up and took him to the hospital, the hospital

7

said:

8

is going to pay the bill."

"We are not going to take him unless we knew who

HR. ZALEZNIK:

9
10

Then that is not a deprivation

of rights that Revere has visited on —
QUESTION;

11

But if that had happened -- If that

12

had happened, would the City of Severe had any further

13

Federal constitutional obligation at that point in

14

time?

15

HR. ZALEZNIK:

16

QUESTION;

17

I believe not. Your Honor.

Not even to take him to some other

hospital?

18

MR. ZALEZNIK;

19

QUESTION;

I do not believe so.

You say that they have the

20

obligation to pick him up and put him in an ambulance,

21

but they don't have any obligation to make sure that the

22

ambulance gets any place that will do him any good.

23

Isn’t that a strange Federal obligation.

24
25

HR. ZALEZNIK:

The reason, I would submit,

Your Honor, is out of the negative.

Were they to leave

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

him lying on the street or were they to take him to the

2

station house and attempt to undergo the normal booking

3

procedures while he was injured and in need of medical

4

attention, that would be a way of inflicting punishment

5

upon him.

6

afoul of the constitutional requirements.

7

That is where, I believe, they would run

QUESTION;

Could one not say precisely the

8

same thing about leaving him in an ambulance unattended

9

in a parking lot of a hospital?
MR. ZALEZNIK;

10

No, because as a practical

11

matter the ambulance — the ambulance driver doesn't

12

simply leave him there, and really the threat that you

13

speak of is simply a hypothetical one.
QUESTION;

14

Yes.

I am asking not the driver,

15

but the city.

You say that the city had the obligation

16

to put him in an ambulance in order to avoid the risk

17

that he would just suffer great pain on the street, I

18

guess .

19

MR. ZALEZNIK;

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

But if he continues to suffer pain

21

in the ambulance and there is no doctor around to

22

alleviate that pain, does their duty terminate, or do

23

they have a continuing duty until they find somebody who

24

will take care of him.

25

MR. ZALEZNIK:

That is what I was asking.
I do not believe the duty is

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

continuing, but it is a fact pattern that is not

What is the duty?
The duty is —

MR. ZALEZNIK*

The duty is not to deny him

access to medical attention.
QUESTION*

You say that that is not

continuing?
MR. ZALEZNIK*

It is simply not to inflict

punishment on him by refusing to —
QUESTION*

Then when he is carried to the

14

hospital, and he sits out there and the hospital won’t

15

take him, and they put him out in the grounds and they

leave him there; is that the and of the duty?

MR. ZALEZNIK*

I do not believe that the city

has a continuing obligation at that stage.

I think you have bit off a little

The point is, if I understand your

MR. ZALEZNIK;

That danger is really a

hypothetical one, and as demonstrated in the facts of

this particular case, the hospital will not simply turn

6

obligations.

The hospital is under a series of

QUESTION;

7

They had no guarantee they would be

8

paid when this person was dumped at their door, did

9

they?

10
11

MR. ZALEZNIK;

They had no guarantee

whatsoever.

12

QUESTION;

They still took him.

13

MR. ZALEZNIK;

Nonetheless, they took him, and

14

what's more under the facts of the case, they took him a

15

second time fully a week after the Chief of the Revere

16

Police Department notified them that Revere had no

17

intention of paying this particular bill.

18

QUESTION;

Are there any Federal cr State laws

19

that require private general hospitals open to the

20

public to take emergency cases, counsel?

21

MR. ZALEZNIK;

There is an express law in the

22

Commonwealth of Massachusetts by statute which provides

23

that any hospital with an emergency wing must provide

24

emergency medical care to all those who need it.

25

fact is, it is a matter of policy and custom, as well as

The

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

law, that hospitals provide emergency medical care to

2

those in need without regard to the source of payment.

3

That is the language of the particular statute.
QUESTION*

4
5

organization, do you know?
HR. ZALEZNIK:

6

7

Massachusetts General Hospital

is a non-profit organization, and if you look -QUESTION:

8

9

Is this hospital a tax-exempt

There is some sort of a quid pro

quo in your intimation that if you have got that kind of

10

benefit, you take on some burdens like emergency

11

treatment.

12

MR. ZALEZNIK:

Necessarily , when the hospital

13

opens its doors and says to the publ ic that it has an

14

emergency wing, it must necessarily provide the

15

emergency services that are required

16

The difference, and what m ay well have

17

occurred under -- had the hospital r ealized that Revere

18

would not pay this bill, perhaps the hospital would not

19

have permitted the patient to stay i n the hospital for

20

the full 10 days.

21

At that stage, after stabi lizing him and

22

giving him the emergency medical tre atment, they could

23

have transferred him to Boston City Hospital, or another

24

publicly supported institution.

25

QUESTION:

Why should Host on City accept him?

11

But it isn't a Revere hospital.

Suppose that Boston City said, "We

Boston City is under an

obligation, as are publicly supported hospitals, to

12

treat those in need.

13

QUESTION;

What your argument implies, I am

24

not saying it's wrong, is that maybe HGH should close

25

its emergency wing.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ZALEZNIK:

If it sought to avoid the

2

outcome in this case, and if its appeals to the

3

legislature to do something with regard to the specific

4

facts of this case we are unveiling, that might well be

5

their alternative.

6

QUESTION;

Don't hospitals accepting Medicare

7

or federally funded patients have a requirement to

8

provide certain emergency services?

9

I mean, aren't they required under Federal

10

regulations to offer a certain range of services in

11

order to qualify?

12

MR. ZALEZNIK;

13

Under certain circumstances, hospitals that do

Yes, Your Honor.

14

accept Federal aid are required to provide treatment to

15

indigents, and there are a series of legislative

16

enactments in this area, but perhaps not one that

17

satisfies this particular case.
QUESTION:

18

Let me try another hypothetical on

19

you addressed at testing the Massachusetts Court’s

20

theory about arrest as soon as this fellow was hit with

21

a bullet.

22

Suppose the policeman hadn't been such a good

23

marksman, and instead of hitting this man, he had hit a

24

tourist or a spectator, and that person was taken to the

25

hospital and given all the same treatment.

Now we have

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

removed the arrest there.

2

MR. ZALEZNIK:

What about that situation?
In that situation, assuming

3

that the individual did not have a State lav tort remedy

4

against the individual officer, so that assuming that

5

there is no fault, as there is no indication in this

6

case that there was any fault on the part of the Revere

7

police, the hospital is left in the identical

8

situation.

9

attention, goes to the hospital and must receive

10

An individual hurt, in need of medical

treatment.
QUESTION;

11

Then this fanciful theory about

12

being arrested when the bullet hit him is irrelevant in

13

your view to the case?
MR. ZALEZNIK;

14

In my view, it is irrelevant

15

and ought not to be viewed as dispositive by this

16

Court.

17

If I may elaborate on your hypothetical.

18

Suppose Mr. Kivlin, the suspect, had had a gun, and in

19

the circumstances of this case had fired a shot that hit

20

that bystander prior to the time that the policeman

21

felled Mr. Kivlin with his bullet.

22

Under that circumstance we would have had two

23

ambulances, or two people in the ambulance, one suspect

24

and one innocent bystander, left in the same position

25

under the Supreme Judicial Court’s formulation.

The

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

suspect would have a guaranteed right to free medical

2

care, and the innocent bystander clearly would not,

3

I think it demonstrates that the injured

4

suspect in this case was in no different position from

5

any citizen who is injured on the street and in need of

6

emergency medical care,
I would like to address a threshold issue for

7

8

a moment, that is, Massachusetts General Hospital's

9

challenge to the jurisdiction of this Court.
According to Massachusetts General Hospital,

10

11

only State law issues are involved in this case, and

12

there is — or at least there is an independent and

13

adequate State law remedy to support -- State law

14

grounds, excuse me, to support the judgment below.
This view rests on a single premise that the

15
16

opinion below was based upon a State created

17

implementing rule, a matter of State law, and that what

18

the Supreme Judicial Court did was merely create a

19

so-called implementing rule.
This viewpoint distorts the clean language of

20
21

the opinion below as well as the State law precedents

22

relied on by the Supreme Judicial Court in the court

23

below.

24

plainer.

25

The language of the opinion could hardly be

After rejecting all forms .of State law

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

contractual recovery, the court below held and I quotes

2

"We hold that the constitutional prohibition against

3

cruel and unusual punishment embodied in the Eighth

4

Amendment to the United States Constitution requires

5

that Revere be liable to the hospital for the medical

6

services rendered Kivlin during his first stay.”

7

Later in the opinion, in its section entitled

8

"Eight Amendment," the court characterizes the position

9

of the hospital as follows:

"The hospital argues that

10

the prohibition against deliberate indifference to the

11

medical needs of prisoners contained implicitly in the

12

Eighth Amendment compels a government agency, or

13

division responsible for supplying those medical needs,

14

to pay for them.”

15

Supreme Judicial Court responded with two words, "We

16

agree."

In response to this assertion, the

17

The opinion below that Severe must be liable

18

to the hospital is clearly a matter of Federal law and

19

is clearly derived in the minds of the Supreme Judicial

20

Court from the Eighth Amendment.

21

independent and adequate State law ground to support the

22

judgment below since the Supreme Judicial Court held in

23

the first part of the opinion that it would be illegal

24

for Revere, under the circumstances of this particular

25

case, to pay Massachusetts General Hospital.

There can be no

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Under the law of the Commonwealth

2

Massachusetts has strict rules against allowing any form

3

of contractual recovery against a municipality unless

4

the prerequisites to a valid contract are in place.

5

Therefore, the phrase that Mass. General uses in this

6

context, its implementing rule, is simply a polite way

7

of trying to reintroduce its theory of an implied

8

contract, implied contract that requires that Revere pay

9

the bill of Mass. General.
This theory was rejected by the court below.

10
11

Therefore, there is no State law ground upon which to

12

rest the judgment below.

13

clearly rests upon the Supreme Judicial Court's

14

erroneous interpretation of the United States

15

Constitution .

Rather the judgment below

With respect to the standing issue, I would

16
17

suggest to the court that the prudential concerns behind

18

the standing doctrine ought to operate to deny Mass.

19

General the right to raise the constitutional rights of

20

the suspect in the context of this particular case.
In this case, based upon the record, no rights

21

22

of the suspect were violated, and the only threat, if

23

indeed there is one, comes from the implied threat of

24

Massachusetts General Hospital not to treat in future

25

cases.

1

QUESTION;

Mr. Zaleznik, are we in a position

2

to impose our rules as to standing on the highest court

3

of the State?

4

ME. ZALEZNIK;

In this circumstance, in the

5

context of this case, Your Honor, this Court is free to

6

judge by Federal rules of standing, since it is clear in

7

the court’s footnote in the opinion below that it was

8

applying Federal laws of standing.

9

Federal question that this Court is free to consider.

10

Therefore, it is a

Had they applied State law rules of standing,

11

then I would agree. Your Honor, the issue would be

But under these circumstances, I think the

QUESTION;

Which footnote is it that you rely

on for that?

16

MR. ZALEZNIK;

17

26 and 27 of the record appendix.

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. ZALEZNIK;

This is footnote No. 7 on pages

Thank you.
The citations are to the

20

Barrows case and to a treatise on the Federal Courts by

21

Professor Wright.

22

QUESTION;

Of course,

they also say in that

23

footnote that there was no standing question raised or

24

The Supreme Judicial Court, when it ruled that

the Eighth Amendment itself contains an obligation to

5

pay on the part of Revere, went beyond anything that was

6

argued in the court below.

7

the court below was that the constitutional duty

involved created the duty upon which to rest an implied

9

contract.

10

So that they only invoked the Constitution as

11

creating this duty of the municipality to the hospital,

15

framed it and there is no opportunity to raise a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL BROAD, ESQ.
OR BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

MR. BROAD:

19

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

20

the Court.

21

the question of jurisdiction and the question of

22

standing.

23

The initial question in this case is in fact

The Petitioner, of course, has the burden of

24

establishing that jurisdiction.

Nonetheless, the

25

Petitioner comes to this Court arguing now that the

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

hospital lacks standing.

The hospital suggests to the

2

Court that on the basis of that allegation and that

3

argument, the Court should properly dismiss the writ of

4

certiorari, accepting the Petitioner's claim that there

5

is no standing in the Federal sense.
I suggest that the resolution ought to be to

6

7

dismiss the writ and not to reverse the court below,

8

because, of course,

9

a broader rule of standing than the Federal court would

10

be.
QUESTIONS

But your point contends, as I

12

understand it, Mr. Broad, that the Massachusetts Supreme

13

Judicial Court didn't do that.

14

against Jackson, they simply followed or intended to

15

follow the Federal rule of standing.

16

MR. BROAD:

By citing Barrows

I think in order to determine what

17

the court in fact did, Justice Rehnquist, we might look

18

very closely at that footnote 7 on page 26 of the

19

Appendix to which my Brother has already referred.

20

footnote consists of two, and only two paragraphs.

21

The

The first paragraph acknowledges that there

22

may be a question of standing but finds it waived,

23

clearly as a matter of State law, citing the applicable

24

State rule of appellate procedure.

25

My Brother construes the second paragraph as a

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decision on the Federal question of standing, and I

2

firmly disagree.
The second paragraph starts out,

3

"Furthermore,

4

standing to litigate constitutional issues is sometimes

5

granted to persons."

6

observation that it would not be unheard of, as a matter

7

of jurisprudence, for a third party to have standing in

8

a case like this, but I find nothing whatsoever in that

9

paragraph that suggests that the Supreme Court purports

10

The court is malting clearly the

to decide or in fact has decided that issue.
Indeed, the two references in the paragraph to

11
12

which my Brother has already referred, the two Federal

13

references, are preceded by a C cite and a CF cite, and

14

I suggest that is not the way that the court would have

15

decided the Federal issue, if it purported to do so.

16

So on the basis of that --

the question of standing can be waived.

I am not saying, Your Honor, a

I am saying a State rule of procedure

QUESTION;

Common law?

12

ME. BROAD:

It is in part common law.

It is

3

in part codified in the rules of appellate procedure

4

16(a)(4) cited on the bottom of page 27.
Where the Federal court might properly decide

5
6

that a standing issue is jurisdictional and can never be

7

waived, the State court may properly take a different

8

approach, and that is exactly what has happened in this

9

case .

20

In fact, in other cases, the Supreme Judicial

21

Court has expressly declined to follow Federal rules of

22

standing.

23

company with the Federal rule, with the Federal

24

approach, I submit, is on the question of waiver, and

25

found that that issue had been waived.

In this case, where the State Court parted

26

QUESTION;

1

2

What makes you think that that is

parting company with the Federal rule?
ME. BROAD:

3

Perhaps I have over-spoken, Your

4

Honor, and it is certainly not essential to my argument

5

that that would he parting company, just that it is

6

clearly presented here in the first paragraph solely as

7

a State law issue.
I suggest, therefore, that because it is open

8
9

to the State court to adopt a rule of standing that

10

allows waiver, whether or not the Federal court would

11

have done the same thing under those circumstances, is

12

fully appropriate for a State court as a matter of State

13

law.

14

It would be improper for this Court, with all

15

respect, to reverse the State court on that ground and

16

tell the State court that it had to do something

17

different, that it had to follow a different rule

18

because perhaps that would be the Federal rule.

19

In the rest of the decision in this case, the

20

hospital suggests that the State Supreme Court was

21

recognizing, implicitly or explicitly, certain special

22

circumstances in Massachusetts that ought to govern the

23

resolution of this case.

24

My Brother has stood before the Court this

25

morning — this afternoon, I am sorry, and announced

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that this is a question that should be decided as a

2

matter of policy, and we agree.

3

as a matter of policy and that the decision below fully

4

reflects the State policies.

We think it was decided

In Massachusetts, unlike most states, there is

5

6

both a State Pate Setting Commission that sets hospital

7

rates, that fixes the rates that we can charge, and

8

there is also a revenue account that places a ceiling, a

9

limitation on the aggregate gross revenue of a

10

hospital.

11

revenue are severely curtailed by the State.

12

So that in two different ways, a hospital’s

Recognizing that fact, which has received an

13

incredible amount of publicity in the State, and

14

recognizing also, as the Supreme Judicial Court did in

15

the early section of this opinion, that none of the

16

traditional elements of the State common law would have

17

provided a payment rule, it was, we submit, fully

18

appropriate for the Court to go on and ask the obvious

19

next question, which is, at least, given the current

20

financial circumstances in the State of Massachusetts

21

and the fact that hospitals, such as the Massachusetts

22

General Hospital, have found it necessary to impose, for

23

example, wage and salary freezes, that some hospitals

24

have started laying off employees --

suspect the answer is no.

is trying to do in this case, Your Honor, is to shift

its burden, its obligation on to the hospital.

8

that is inappropriate.

9
10
11
12

13

But what the City of Revere

We think

It certainly would be open to the City of
Revere, if it felt it desirable —
QUESTION;

First we have to know if there is

an obligation to shift, don't we?
MR. BROAD;

That is true, Your Honor.

I think

14

I heard counsel very clearly start out this afternoon by

15

acknowledging that there is at least some obligation to

16

do at least something to provide treatment.

17

I suggest that he stopped too soon in

18

expressing that obligation, and that, for example,

19

merely picking up the injured party who was, by the

20

acknowledgement of the Revere police -- this appears in

21

the Appendix at page 11, that Revere police came to the

22

hospital and informed hospital personnel that the

23

suspect was then under arrest.

24
25

QUESTION;

Are you talking now, Mr. Broad,

about a Federal constitutional obligation?

7
8

person was really in custody or not in this case, and

9

the State court disposes of that rather quickly.
QUESTION:

10

Perhaps questions from the Bench

11

have side-tracked you from what I thought was your

12

argument that this is basically a State law ground

13

ultimately that the Supreme Judicial Court has taken. I

14

had not understood you at this point to be defending the

15

Federal constitutional basis.
MR. BROAD:

16

I think Your Honor understands my

17

argument correctly and has stated it, in fact, quite

18

well.

19

All I’m pointing out is that I think in

20

fashioning the State rule, the State implementing rule,

21

that the State Supreme Court could legitimately have in

22

mind the burden of protecting the underlying

23

constitutional argument.

24
25

QUESTION:

But you are here to defend an

opinion of the State Supreme Court, the highest court,

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that there is a Federal basis for the obligation, a

2

Federal constitutional basis for the obligation that you

3

have talked about; is that not so?
SR. BROAD:

4
5
6
7
8
9

That is not how I would read the

opinion.
QUESTION:

What is the Eighth Amendment

discussion about?
MR. BROAD:

I think, Your Honor, that what the

State Court did was to fashion a rule to protect an

10

underlying constitutional right, without saying that the

11

particular implementing rule was itself required by the

12

Constitution.

13

It is not unusual, Your Honor, to see in cases

14

a question of remedy, and the essence of structuring a

15

remedy is, of course, making a choice among various

16

alternatives that might be open.

17

QUESTION:

But wouldn't you think, if it were

18

an implementing rule that is State-based, assuming that

19

the Justices of the Supreme Judicial Court of

20

Massachusetts know how to write opinions as well as

21

everyone else, that that would have appeared in the

22

first part of the opinion, where you are talking about

23

various State law bases for recovery, not as your

24

opponent has quoted, the first two sentences of the

25

section called "Eighth Amendment" on 5a, where they say,

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

"The hospital argues the prohibition against deliberate

2

indifference compels a government agency or division

3

responsible for supplying those medical needs to pay for

4

them."

5

Then they say,

"We agree."

There is no intimation that there is any

6

bridge there between the constitutional obligation and

7

the result.

8
9

HR. BROAD:

The transition there, Your Honor,

I agree, may be a bit choppy.

If I could refer the

10

Court to the top of page 29 of the Appendix, and the

11

bottom of page 28, this is the part of the opinion where

12

the Court is really getting into the discussion of the

13

issue as opposed to the preliminaries.

14

The Court says that the person in question was

15

brought to the hospital as a prisoner -- I am reading

16

from the bottom of page 28 -- and that Revere has a

17

legal duty to supply him with necessary medical care.

18

Then it goes on to say;

"To ensure the

19

prisoner's right to medical care."

20

of implementing, "to ensure medical care, Revere must be

21

held liable to the hospital."

22

the two citations that follow that are citations to

23

State cases, not to Federal cases, not to Federal

24

constitutional cases.

25

I think that speaks

Hotice, Your Honor, that

So I would suggest that perhaps the Court

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would not have reached that question if it had not been

2

concerned with ultimately protecting an acknowledged

3

Federal constitutional right, but that a State Court

4

ought to have greater latitude to fashion the means for

5

protecting the right than perhaps a Federal Court would,

6

because obviously the intrusion that a Federal Court can

7

justify into the State sphere is limited, and this Court

8

has held that repeatedly in cases like Millikan versus

9

Bradley.
QUESTION:

very clearly held that the government does not in

Honor, so I don't know what happened at that argument in

2

the case.

3

in all candor, a little bit unclear exactly what

4

argument was made.

But in reading the brief, I think it may be,

It is clear that the hospital raised the

Eighth Amendment, I think correctly it should have been

of alerting the State Court to the fact that there was

an underlying responsibility --

10

But he says the argument was that

11

the Eighth Amendment created a duty to take him to the

12

hospital, but that gave rise an implied contract to pay,

13

and that as of State law you can’t have such an implied

14

contract.

15

MR. BROAD;

That is not stated at least so

16

clearly in the brief, Your Honor, to be able to

17

determine which way it came down.

18

I would suggest that consistent with the

19

opinions of this Court, insofar as it may not be

20

entirely clear whether we have a Federal law decision, a

21

State law decision, or some amalgam intertwining the

22

two, that it would be appropriate for this Court to

23

remand the case to the State Supreme Court under a

24

Minnesota versus National T approach, and suggest

25

respectfully that the State Court might clarify that

MR. BROAD:

I understand.

I would like to address, at least briefly,

23

some questions that were raised by the Court in the

City’s argument, the question of ether obligations that

25

might exist for the provision of care by the hospital.

My Brother made a reference to a State law, by

the State Legislature in that statute has cut out a much

In our brief, we have also cited relevant

18

sections from the Medicare Hospital Manual at footnote

19

58 on page 34 of the brief, where the Federal

20

government, at least an agency of the government, very

21

clearly takes the position that medicare payment may not

22

be made for services provided to prisoners because the

23

State or other governmental agency is already

24

responsible for their medical care.

25

In general, the position of the hospital is,

first, that the Court ought not reach the merits because

it should find that the State Court was free to have

that, as argued by the Petitioner, this Court ought not

unnecessary for a prisoner later to brine an action for

disagreement among Members of the Court, or some

uncertainty in the mind of the Court as to the exact

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IRA H. ZALEZNIK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. ZALFZNIKj

Just one point, Your Honor.

6

Ky Erother points to a single sentence at page

7

29 of the Appendix and at page 779 of the Opinion as

8

justifying reading the court below as creating a State

9

implementing rule, but that sentence was followed by two

10

sentences saying that inadequate funding will not excuse

11

the deprivation of constitutional rights, and that even

12

though a payment may be in violation of a State or local

13

law, it will not avail Revere of any relief.
So that it is clear that what the court below

14
15

did was to basp its ruling on an erroneous

16

interpretation of the Federal United States

17

Constitution, and not any sort of State law implementing

18

remedy.

Thank you very much. Your Honor.
