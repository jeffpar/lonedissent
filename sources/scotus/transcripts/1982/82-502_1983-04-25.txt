ORAL ARGUKENT OF WILLIAM D. CARLE, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

HR. CARLE:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court.

11

The issue in this case is whether the

12

voluntary acceptance of compensation plus the filing and

13

review of certain documents by the Deputy Commissioner

14

is sufficient to trigger the assignment provisions of

15

Section 33(b) of the Longshoremen's and Harborworker*s

16

Compensation Act.

17

Secondarily, whether under the circumstances

18

of this case there is a conflict of interest which,

19

between the employer and the employee, which would

20

preclude an assignment under Section 33(b).

21

It is the petitioner's position in this case

22

that the Sixth Circuit Decision is erroneous, that it

23

misapplied the law as it relates to Section 33(b) and

24

applied — relied to a great extent upon conflict of

25

interest principles which this court has held are not

1

applicabis in ths classic situation that exists between

2

the longshoreman and his employer.

3

I would like to discuss just briefly the

4

facts.

5

thereafter the stevedore employer commenced benefits to

3

Hr. Duris which were paid either bi-weekly or weekly for

7

a period of two years through April 28, 1977.

Shortly

At that time, Mr. Duris had recovered and

8

Mr. Duris was injured in May of 1975.

returned to work and payments were stopped or suspended

10

and a form filed with the Department of Labor.

We also

11

know, at this point, in time that during the intervening

12

period, or during that period between '75 and *77, that

13

there was a formal claim filed by Mr. Duris and certain

14

other informal conferences, or a conference held with

15

all of the parties represented.
Dn April 8, 1980, the lawsuit with which we

16
17

are here concerned was commenced and on Februay 25,

18

1983, Duris received a final award.

19

entire compensation proceedings and otherwise, Duris has

20

been represented by competent counsel.

Throughout the

I would like, at this point, to give you an

21

22

overview of what our argument is going to be in this

23

case.

24

Section 33(b) of the Act contemplates an assignment in

25

each and every case.

It is petitioner’s contention, first, that

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Secondly, that the congressional hearings at

2

the time of the amendments indicate that the assignment

3

should take place within a reasonable time after the

4

inception of each claim.

5

compensation orders are not required to constitute an

6

awa rd.

7

Third, that formal

Four, I think it is important that the quid

8

pro quo of the Act be maintained in balance.

9

that Congress, when it amended the Act, certainly did

10

not contemplate eight years between injury and

11

assignment.

12

And five,

The Sixth Circuit's decision in this case, we

13

submit, is erroneous in that it took an unduly

14

restrictive approach to the question at hand.

15

Circuit started its opinion and discussion of the legal

16

issues by summarily disposing of two cases from another

17

Circuit which it stated it simply would not follow.

The Sixth

18

These cases had held that some act of

19

ratification of compensation plus the filing of

20

documents and acceptance of compensation by the

21

longshoreman was sufficient to constitute an award under

22

the Act and specifically 33(b).

23

were filed of record in the Duris case and the court

24

gave absolutely no consideration to them in considering

25

whether there should have been an award.

These same documents

1

fact, I don't even find them mentioned in the opinion of

2

the court.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Carle, would you agree that the

4

statutory term compensation order is a term of art as

5

it's used elsewhere in the Longshoremen's and

6

Harborworker's Act?

7

MR. CARLE:

That troubles me on the term of

8

art.

9

because you find as you read the act they use the term

I don’t believe it's a term of. art, really,

10

compensation order,

11

upon what subject they're attempting to approach.

12

just hardly think that it’s a term of art, at least in

13

the sense that I understand what is meant by a term of

14

art.

15

QUESTION:

they use the term order, depending
And I

I think the Solicitor General's

16

brief indicated support for that concept and I wondered

17

if that were true, why the same meaning wouldn't carry

18

forward in Section 33(b).

19
20
21

MR. CARLE:

Well, it's certainly our

contention that it don’t.
QUESTION:

There doesn’t seem to be any real

22

reason why the term wouldn't mean the same thing in all

23

sections, including this one.

24

interrupted, I — the respondent and the Solicitor

25

General's position indicate that all the respondent's

And while I have you

employer had to do to ensure receipt of an award in a

2

compensation order was to file a Notice of Controversion

3

and request issuance of an award by the Deputy

4

Commissioner and that it didn’t require a full

5

proceeding, but that it is possible to get an award by

6

simply asking for it.
MR. CARLEi

7

That, I don't believe, is quite

8

correct.

The government does state in their brief that

9

an award, they would seem to implicate, at any rate,

10

that ah award is very easy to obtain from the Department

11

of Labor.

12

parties and they simply, the formal award, such as was

13

later entered in this case in February of 1983, simply

14

does not come around quite that easy.

15

fact —

16

The award contemplates agreement between the

QUESTION*

As a matter of

Well, this one came as a result of

17

a formal hearing, which is one way to do it.

18

position taken by the Solicitor General and the SG is

19

that under the regulations of this Act, you don’t have

20

to go to a formal hearing, that the employer can simply

21

ask for the formal award and will receive it.

22

MR. CARLE:

But the

I find no authority for that in

23

the regulations or the Act itself.

If the employer

24

contravenes, he can obtain an award and really, when you

25

analyze the Duris opinion, that is what the Duris

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

opinion has to say, that you must contravene in order to

2

obtain an award and our position is that that certainly

3

is not necessary.

4

I would intend to submit that it’s not even proper.

5

we’ll go on with that, as you'll see, Justice O'Connor.

Indeed, as I go through the argument,
And

Just prior to disposing summarily of the two

6
7

cases which were decided counter to what the Sixth

8

Circuit was going to decide, the Sixth Circuit had this

9

to say.

'The Act noted earlier makes purposeful use of

10

the term award.

11

award, there should be no assignment and no six-month

12

limitation period."

13

Thus, if benefits are paid without an

Now I can agree literally with what the court

14

has stated here.

15

apply it to the Act as the court did in this case, is

16

going to do extreme violence to the scheme of the Act

17

and if the court would view the statistics compiled by

18

the Department of Labor, which were lodged with the

19

court by our amicus in this case, you will see that only

20

in two percent of the cases are formal compensation

21

awards entered.

22

less than that in undisputed cases.

23

But I submit to interpret that and

And that's disputed cases, and it's

Now, we firmly believe that Congress intended

24

that an award and assignment be issued in every case and

25

we point to the 1972 amendments to the Act in which

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Congress extensively revised Section 905(b) with respect

2

to third party liability.

3

Congress stated that the third party liability action is

4

to be brought in "accordance with the provisions of

5

Section 33(b)."

find in that revision,

Furthermore, the quid pro quo of the act

6
7

certainly gives the employer, we contend, the right to

8

review independently all of his cases and determine

9

whether he wants to bring a third party action.

It's

10

also clear, we believe, that if the employer is going to

11

lose this right, he has indeed lost a valuable right.
When we look at Section 33 as a whole, because

12
13

there's the election and then the assignment and then

14

some other sections, but when we look at that as a

15

whole, we’ll find that Sections

16

33 certainly give‘the employee and employer both a cause

17

of action, at least by implication, certainly to the

18

employee.

19

(d), gives the employer a cause of action for recovery

20

under the Act of his compensation loss.

(a) and (b) of Section

And for certain in Section, I believe it’s

Sow, if that is the case, then certainly this

21

22

statute contemplates an assignment in each and every

23

case.

24

employee would have consecutive rights to each third

25

party action is implicit, we believe, in the hearings.

The conditional understanding that employer and

9

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Now, the Sixth Circuit, having said that in

1

2

the case of voluntary payments there could be no

3

assignment — no award and no assignment, thus no

4

assignment, or no six month limitation period, realized

5

that they had to come up with something for this poor

6

employer, who is left with his compensation payments.

7

And in the event the employee did not sue a third party,

8

he had no way to recover them.
So, the Sixth Circuit said, all right,

9

we'll

10

give him a Burnside remedy.

The Burnside remedy stems

11

from a case decided by this court back in 1969 in which

12

a tort action was permitted to the stevedore in order to

13

permit him to recover other than under Section 33 of the

14

Act.
So, they came up with this Burnside remedy,

15
16

injected it into the case, and said Mr. Employer, you've

17

got your remedy, while we, on the petitioner's side,

18

question the existence or nonexistence, whether the

19

existence or nonexistence of this nonstatutory cause of

20

action is relevant to these proceedings.
Nevertheless, certainly the viability of

21

22

Burnside today is extremely questionable in view, again,

23

of the extensive revision to Section 905(b), third party

24

liability Section of the Act with its exclusivity

25

language.

Furthermore, I find it extremely hard to

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

rationalize, in my mind, that any employer today would

2

want a tort-only rause of action for recovery of his

3

compensation loss or other damages in which he would be

4

subjected to the possibility, at least, will he be

5

subjected to the proportional fault recovery in the

6

case, and possibly no recovery.

7

Next, the Sixth Circuit in Duris hit on the

8

controversion issue, which I was discussing a few

9

moments ago with Justice O'Connor.

The court expressed

10

the view, with respect to controversion that by the

11

employer controverting the claim, that it would bring

12

the employee into contact with the statutes which would,

13

in turn, make the employee aware of the assignment

14

provision and then, in view of its previous statement,

15

which I quoted earlier, indicated that the only true way

16

in which an award could be obtained in a 33(b) action

17

would be via contravention.

18

He suggest that the Sixth's Circuit's

19

reasoning is faulty.

20

contemplate the informal administration of this Act and

21

to minimize contravention and/or hearings which would be

22

held as a result thereof.

23

Certainly the regulations

What, I think, the court neglected to consider

24

is that when you controvert a claim, you controvert the

25

right to receive compensation and under the Act, Section

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

14 and Section 19, in order — well, both provide that

2

this will happen early on in the handling of any

3

particular case within 14 days under Section 14 and

4

within 14 days under Section 19.

5

you controvert, it's going to happen early on in the

6

case.

But, in any event, if

It will admittedly result in a hearing and

7

8

award.

Now, how controversion is going to make the

9

employee cognizant of his rights under the statutes and,

10

in particular, his rights under the assignment

11

provision, is certainly a mystery to me.

12

operation of the act, we submit, should not call for

13

contravention by the employer on each and every case in

14

order to obtain this award and, indeed, as I suggested

15

previously, we feel it may be highly improper.

16

The smooth

Next, the court considered the conflict of

17

interest guestion and pointed to the disincentive on the

18

part of the employer to bring suit under the Act.

19

Sixth Circuit stated "this conflict of interest problem

20

makes us hesitate to countenance any interpretation of

21

the Act which would expand the assignment provision of

22

Section 33.”

23

The

24

the court, mainly conflict of interest, will not legally

legal principles.

10

I’d like, at this point, to discuss, for a
short time, the history of the Act.
QUESTION:

Before you do that, Mr. Carle, can

I ask you just one —

11

MR. CARLE:

12

QUESTION;

Certainly.
— one specific question?

When, in

13

your view, did the six months period start to run, when

14

the form 206 was filed or the form 208?

15

think, is a little ambiguous on that.

16

MR. CARLE:

Yes.

The brief, I

The — what we believe is

17

necessary is that you have to have an agreement of the

18

parties along with the filing of the documents.

19

the compensation. Justice Stevens, is going to start

20

even before the filing of the 206.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CARLE:

Now,

I understand.
And after the 206, of course, it

23

would continue at the same rate.

Now, when do we

24

contend that this agreement took place?

25

employee accepted, when there was really an agreement

When the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

for the employee to accept the compensation and when the

2

206 was filed with the Department of Labor, reviewed by

3

them and filed.

At that point --

QUESTION:

4

You then are not relying on the

5

208, because your brief says when the 206 and 208 were

6

filed.
MR. CARLE:

7

8

filed.

That's right.

The 208 was

We did rely upon the 208.
QUESTION;

9

Yes.

10

MR. CARLE;

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CARLE;

But you don’t today?
Pardon?
You don't today.
No, we suggested that it could be

13

used as one means of determining when an award might be

14

entered.

15

at the end of the temporary total disability period and

16

it is a form that is used in each and every case and if

17

it were used, it would give the longshoreman a little

18

bit longer period in which to consider his options.

19

20

The 208, as I’m sure you’re aware, takes place

QUESTION:

What if he had a permanent

disability case?

21

MR. CARLE;

22

QUESTION:

Pardon?
What if you have permanent

23

disability, so that your period of payments extended for

24

a longer period of time?

25

MR. CARLE:

No.

That’s a problem with the

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

208, to be very frank
QUESTION;

2

What I'm really trying to find out

3

is whether you really rely on the 208 form at all or

4

not.

5

extreme, but we have to figure out what the rule is.

I know that would make the case a little less

MR. CARLE:

6

It's a form — it’s one of the

7

considerations which we propose that this court might

8

consider and, as I say, I understand it has the

9

advantage of certainty after a temporary disability

10

period.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. CARLE:

13
14

In a temporary disability case.
It has the 'disadvantage of handing

the employer a stale claim.
QUESTION:

I suppose the trouble with the form

15

206 is that it's a little bit contrary to the terms of

16

the statute, because that form, in terms, is

17

compensation without an award.

18

says, and we need an award, don't we?

19

MR. CARLE;

That's what the form

Yes, but really, as we pointed out

20

in our brief, all compensation starts without an award.

21

At least, in my view it does, from practical operation.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But the statute talks about an

award, that's the problem.
MR. CARLE:

Yes.

Eut the award comes at the

time that there's an acceptance of that compensation by

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

the longshoreman, plus the filing of the form with the

2

Deputy Commissioner and then he's got six months to

3

consider his options from that point on.
In examining the history, just briefly, we're

4
5

all aware that when the Act was enacted in 1927 that the

6

longshoreman had no option.

7

compensation or he was required to file against a third

8

party.

9

He either took his

There was an automatic assignment under the

10

statutes as they existed at that time and the quid pro

11

quo of the Act I think is important at that time, in

12

that the employee gave up a right to sue for sure

13

compensation and, in return, the employer accepted fault

14

on a no-fault basis, basically.

15

to note that from 1927 to the present day, that

16

assignment provision has been part of the quid pro quo

17

of the Act.

And it's also important

18

I'd like to hold five minutes, if I may.

19

3UESTI0N:

Hr. Carle, it seems to me that the

20

interpretation you ask us to make here would render

21

meaningless the penalty provision in Section 1U.

22

that Act, if an employer stops, or fails to make

23

payments on time, and there's no award by a compensation

24

order, the penalty's only ten percent.

25

Under

Eut if there is an award by compensation

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

order, the penalty is 20 percent.

2

interpretation applies, then that Section doesn't mean

3

anything.
'MR. CARLEs

4

Now if your

Well, I would just have to

5

respectably disagree, Justice O'Connor.

6

there is both the ten percent penalty, prior to an

7

award, and the 20 percent penalty after an award and I

8

certainly -QUESTIONS

9

I feel that

But it’s your position, now, that

10

just starting payments, making payments to the employee,

11

in effect, amounts to an award by a compensation order

12

under Rule -- Section 33.

13

that any penalty after you start payments is at the 20

14

percent rate.

15

MR. CARLEs

16

QUESTIONS

That would mean, thereafter,

That's correct.

That's correct.

So you don't need Section 14 to say

17

there are two kinds of penalties, the ten percent and

18

the twenty percent because you never use the ten

19

percent.

20

Right?
MR. CARLEs

Well, it would depend on how long

21

and when they started the compensation.

22

penalties are both there and I think —

QUESTION*

-- as an employer,

then that’s an

2

award equivalent to an award by a compensation order so,

3

thereafter, you have only the 20 percent penalty and

4

you'd never reach the ten percent.

5

that, would you?

6

HR. CARLE:

You’d never need

Well, you would certainly need it,

7

for instance, the act provides for contravention

8

immediately or within 14 days.

9

within 14 days under Section 14, so if you contravene

10

and did not pay, and then there did come a subsequent

11

hearing at which they said, pay, you're going to have a

12

ten percent penalty throughout that entire period.

13

think, I think the ten percent penalty is there and I

14

think it’s there for a purpose.

Section 33(b) under the Act, to quote Justice

21

Stevens in writing an opinion for the unanimous Court in

22

the Rodriguez v. Compass Shipping case stated that the

23

wording of Section 933 is both mandatory and unequivocal.

24
25

I submit to this court that this Section, this
wording of Section 933(b) is no less mandatory and

You

We, as lawyers, have the responsibility to

8

advise our clients in cases when they come to us and ask

9

us what their rights are.

We, in this situation, with

10

the case of Joseph Duris, had the direct responsibility

11

to advise him when he came to see us just what his

12

rights were.

13

In this case, he had received a form after

14

claim was made, and on that form it stated, payment of

15

compensation without award.

16

compensation within 14 days following his injury.

17

Indeed, he was paid

He was provided with notice that he was paid

18

compensation.

19

compensation reflected in boldface letters and the form

20

he received, payment without award.

21

The notice with which he was paid

Ha then takas that form to his lawyer, seeking

22

to be sure that he is getting everything he’s entitled

23

to and what am I going to advise him?

24

what I should do.

25

the statute tells me that there is an abolute,

I'm going to do

I'm going to look to the statute, and

2

running of the statute of limitations in this case.

3

I'm going to tell that to my client.

4

advice, we will proceed in our litigation.

And

And on that

In this case, there had not been until

5

6

February 25, 1983, any award in a compensation order.

7

To touch upon the point brought up by Justice O'Connor,

8

there is no question in our mind.

9

in the mini of the amicus from the Solicitor General’s

There is no question

10

office, nor in the Longshoremen's Union, nor in ATLA,

11

who submitted amicus briefs to this court, that the

12

language is mandatory and that there is that condition

13

precedent, that that longshoreman need not worry about

14

pursuing his thirl party remedy until such time as he

15

receives an award in a compensation order which is filed

16

by the Deputy Commissioner.

It's purposeful language.

17

[Jntil that event occurs, he does not have to

18

concern himself with proceeding, other than to try and

19

weigh what can or cannot be done in the future, to see

20

what his injuries are, to see what kind of problems he's

21

facing.

22

Unfortunately notwithstanding this clear

23

language, there has arisen a conflicts in the Circuits

24

and there's a reason for that.

25

the petitioners rely, particularly in light of the fact

The key case upon which

that they're relying on form 206, which is the very form

2

I just mentioned, which has the bold print, without an

3

award, is the Liberty Mutual v. Ameta case.

4

that this case is an aberration of the law.

It

10

together with the ship owner and made a settlement, left

11

out the lien and the rights of the equitable maritime

12

under general maritime law lien of the employer.

13

The court, in an effort to remedy that law,

14

went about seeking out proper -- the proper thing to do,

15

but unfortunately in the wrong method, and they pursued

16

the case from the standpoint that they wanted to get

17

that payment back to the employer.

18

Therefore, they came up with the idea that

19

mere acceptance of compensation under an award and

20

certain acts of ratification, that meaning that there

21

were some informal hearings, would constitute what they

22

felt was an award in the compensation order.

23

unfortunate that they felt the need —

QUESTION:

It is very

Does this happen frequently in this

area of the law, where the injured party makes a deal

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

with the shipowner?

2

ME. GALLAGHER*

3

QUESTI0H;

4

MR. GALLAGHER;

Very rare.

Why is that?
I think that the situation is

5

such that the longshoremen really follow what the

6

dictations of the law are.

7

under the no-fault provisions of the Act and they're

8

satisfied to a certain extent.

9

and then pursue their remedies once they're advised just

They get prompt compensation

Then they seek counsel

10

what they are, both by word of mouth and then onward to

11

see an attorney.

12

But it's very unusual for them to contact the

13

shipowner or his carrier, from the standpoint that he

14

just doesn’t have access to them unless there's

15

potentially an insurance adjustor involved who perhaps

16

would contact him directly and that would put up the red

17

flag that he should seek counsel.

18

that it's very rare, Your Honor.

19

So I submit to you

It also brings up another important point,

20

though, from the standpoint that when you have a

21

situation where an individual is injured and if we were

22

to construe the statute to be just what this says it

23

is — just what the petitioners are desirous of having

24

it say, the longshoreman really only has six months and

25

14 days within which to bring an action.

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

I submit to you that’s woefully inadequate and

1

2

Congress recognized it to be just that, woefully

3

inadequate.

4

and if that was the law, I’d have to say to him, we have

5

to file suit right now and I have to attach

6

interrogatories to my complaint to seek out if there's

7

any other individual who may responsible for your

8

injury.

9

The problem is, if he were to come to me

By that, I mean a case just like this.
Joseph Duris was injured in Kay of 1975 while

10

acting in his capacity as a longshoreman, but the

11

shipowner wasn’t the primary defendant.

12

defendant was a bare boat charter and I, as trial

13

counsel, would have to advise my client, we’ve got to

14

get that suit on right now and find out if there is

15

somebody else, if there’s a dry boat or bare boat

16

charter whom we really should be suing, or you may find

17

that if we don’t file in time and have the right party,

18

then you’re totally lost as far as the third party

19

liability aspect of the case.

The primary

20

So that short statute, the construction which

21

the petitioners submit, is a very dangerous proposition

22

for the longshoreman.

23

we’re, excuse me, dealing with a situation where the

24

Liberty Hutual case started this series of cases

25

indicating that mere compensation was mere sufficient.

As I’ve mentioned, unfortunately,

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

And that was even expanded upon,

2

unfortunately, by the Simmons case.

3

case, they went even one step further in setting up

4

their three-pronged test, which is outlined in our brief.

5

And the Simmons

The unfortunate aspect of that three-pronged

6

test is that the very second element of that test is to

7

the effect that when-the employer's form LS-206 is

8

filed, that is one of the elements under which the

9

triggering mechanism for the statute becomes applicable.

10

Again, the same bugaboo, the same problem, the

11

same area of concern.

12

payment without an award on a form, taking the

13

petitioner's standpoint, is truly payment under an award.

14

The longshoreman is told that a

Under such circumstance he’d have to take

15

immediate action.

16

this, you're going to flood the courts with lawsuits,

17

because we've got to get them out in time, we’re going

18

to have to move quickly.

19

Following an interpretation such as

Also, going on from the sentence court, the

20

Second Circuit, to a certain extent, got in on the act

21

from the standpoint that they also interpreted somewhat

22

less accurately what the statute actually says.

23

The Second Circuit maintained that Liberty

24

Mutual was in error, that there's no way that the

25

longshoreman should have the responsibility of picking

2

required.

3

situation where it arises that the longshoreman has

4

access to all of the information available to him

5

relative to what the award would or would not be, in its

6

total, so that he would have to have an understanding of

7

the totality of the benefits applicable to him before he

8

should make such an award.

But they stated that you should have a

9

Unfortunately, they also, although holding

10

that in that fashion, neglected to truly look at the

11

statute and make the determination that the statutory

12

wording is mandatory and is unequivocal and requires one

13

thing, the condition precedent that there be, in each

14

and every case when the assignment provisions are to

15

become effective, an award in a compensation order filed

16

by the Deputy Commissioner.

17

The significance of that is that the award in

18

a compensation order is a definable entity.

19

mentioned in several parts throughout the statute,

20

Section 914(e) and (f), particularly in point from the

21

standpoint that it sets up specific penalty provisions

22

pending upon which actions the employers take.

The legislative history is also indicative of

the intent of Congress that this wording be clear.

Since 1938, the courts, I submit to your case of

American Stevedores v. Porello, holding that mere

13

compensation is not sufficient to trigger the statute of

14

limitations, is still good, valid and viable law today.

15

The wording that I'm referring to, the award

16

in a compensation order filed by a Deputy Commissioner,

17

had not been changed by Congress in any of the three

18

times this Act has been amended.

19

the two, since it was put into the Act in 1938.

20

Strike that, I mean

It was thoroughly reviewed in

1959 and at

21

those legislative hearings it was even pointed out that

22

Congress was very interested in the state of the

23

judicial interpretation of this statute.

24
25

They liked what they saw.

They liked what

this court was doing and what the appellate courts and

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

circuit courts wars doing, because they were

2

interpreting the law as it was and as it is today.

3

So also in 1972 when they amended this Section

4

of the statute again.

5

This wording provided the condition precedent upon which

6

an employer would take action.

7

effectuated, there was no need for the employee to take

8

action.

They didn't touch this wording.

And until it was

9

I submit to you that in the reply brief of the

10

petitioners, they saw the infirmities of their arguments

11

relative to the Fourth Circuit and the Second Circuit

12

and they came up with a new theory, that being that

13

Section 919(c) of the Act does not apply to strictly

14

controverted claims, that it applies in all cases.

15

A careful review of that statute will reflect

16

that that's just not the case.

17

only, and is applicable only, to those cases where there

18

is a controversion.

19

important, too, from the standpoint as mentioned by Mr.

20

Carle earlier.

21

Section 919(c) reflects

And the controversion concept's

They maintain that the employer must

22

controvert every claim in order to get his assignment.

23

Number one, he's not that interested in that assignment

24

to begin with, if there’s a third party liability claim

25

because he’s going to watch the suit of the longshoreman.

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Number two, the situation is such that he

2

doesn't need to pursue the matter, because of that

3

action, and at the same time he has his own rights under

4

the Burnside decision of a general maritime action over

5

against the shipowner, should he desire to do that.

6

That case, which has been attacked by the

7

petitioners, is still valid law.

8

Steamship Lines v. Delasantos left open the fact that

9

the shipowner still has a duty to a longshoreman and if

10

he breaches that duty, he would have to be subjected to

11

a third party suit, or can be subjected to a third party

12

suit directly from the longshoreman.

13

This court in Cindia

So therefore, that Notice of Contravention,

14

the active participation of the longshoreman in

15

contravening is not that necessary from a simple

16

standpoint that if, at any time, he's worried about his

17

compensation benefits, the fact that he's put this money

18

out and hasn’t got it back yet, he can, at any time,

19

voluntarily indicate to the Deputy Commissioner that he

20

wants an award.

21

That is 19(c) -- 919(c).

The Code of Federal Regulations also provides

22

for that interpretation and that is, that promulgated by

23

the Secretary of Labor.

question?

the statute literally and there’s no six months

7

limitation period here.

8

is there on the suit you may bring?
MR. GALLAGHER;

9

What, if any, limitation period

I think that you have to go

10

right back to the statute, that there still is a six

11

month statute of limitations, only on those occasions,

12

however, when there is an award.

14

Under 98 percent of the cases,

there's no award.
MR. GALLAGHER:

15

Well, in most situations, it’s

16

up to the amployer.

It's the shipowner who wants you to

17

say that there’s not going to be an award, that the

18

figures are reflective of very few awards.
The realities are that if the individuals who
i

19

20

the Act is to protect, and in this example, the

21

employer, wants to have the award, wants to have his

22

assignment, he can do so at any time.
