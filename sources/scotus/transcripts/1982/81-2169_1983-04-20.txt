ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. LASSO, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. LASSO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, this case presents the issue of

9

whether a person who pleaded guilty in state court to

10

making illegal drugs and who did not raise the validity

11

of the search that produced the essential evidence of

12

that crime can later bring an action under 42 United

13

States Code Section 1983 claiming that that same search

14

was unconstitutional.

15

The issue in this case can be stated perhaps

16

even more narrowly.

17

though the Respondent, Mr. Prosise, had numerous

18

opportunities to raise the validity of that search in

19

the state court?

20

he has never claimed that he had inadequate counsel?

21

And can he do so even under the circumstances where he

22

tried to withdraw his guilty plea, claim his innocence,

23

and even then not raise the validity of the search?

24
25

Can the 1983 action be brought even

Can he bring this action even though

Appeals is that it adopts as a policy —

Rehnquist.

5

That is correct. Justice

At no ti me was there a motion to suppress,
As a polic y matter, the Fourth Circuit has

6

adopted a rule which encourages the accused to bypass

7

the very state proce sses which are designed to protect

8

the important consti tutional rights embodied in the

9

Fourth Amendment.

I n effect, the Fourth Circuit has

10

sanctioned a rule wh ich allows the abuse of those state

11

processes.

conservation of judi cial resources, avoidance of

Again, at no time was a motion to suppress

ever made, and the lower court never mentions the

20

crucial importance that this search played in the

21

conviction of Mr. Prosise.

22

because the lower court simply finds such considerations

23

irrelevant to its new rule that there will be no

24

preclusion whatever in a guilty plea case involving a

25

Fourth Amendment claim.

Apparently this is so

QUESTION!

Mr. Lasso, do you think that the

3

absence of a motion to suppress played any part in the

4

reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth

Circuit?

versus McCurry in that way.
QUESTION;

11

As you read the Court of Appeals

12

opinion, does it reserve the questio n as to whether

13

there would be preclusion had there been a suppression

14

hearing, or does it say there would have been

15

preclusion?
MR. LASSO;

16

I think it per haps reserves that

17

question. It is very unclear.

19

defenses that could be made, affirma tive defenses that

21

question.

22

It re serves the question

It avoids that

What it says is that looki ng at the law, the

23

law is developing into one major det ermining factor, and

24

that is incentive to litigate, and i f a person has

25

incentive to litigate in the lower c ourt during his

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

conviction, then there should be preclusion.

2

the mistaken assumption of the Fourth Circuit is that it

3

simply isn't worth the effort for a District Court or a

4

Trial Court to determine in guilty plea cases like this

5

whether or not there is incentive.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LASSO:

However,

What was Prosise sentenced to?
He was sentenced initially to 25

8

years in the state penitentiary.

At the time he gave

9

his guilty plea, the judge asked him, did he know that

10

he could possibly receive 40 years in the state

11

penitentiary.

12

advised .

He said that he did.

He had been

13

There isn't any question in this case, really,

14

but that Me. Prosise — excuse me, Mr. Prosise had every

15

incentive in the world to litigate this search.

16

could have been done easily, at no cost to him, and in a

17

sense, his decision to forego making such a motion to

18

suppress is really tantamount, I would think, to an

19

admission that there would be no merit to it.

20

In any event, he chose not to do so.

21

QUESTION:

It

Has he at any time ever raised a

22

question of effective assistance of counsel or lack of

23

it?

24

MR. LASSO:

No, Your Honor, he has not.

25

Now, the other assumption of the Fourth

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Circuit — there ire two others which are, I believe,

2

mistaken.

3

non-preclusion is somehow consistent with Virginia law.

4

The other mistaken assumption is that Mr. Prosise and

5

persons like him somehow have a right to be in federal

6

court at least one time to raise these Fourth Amendment

7

cla ims.

8

The first is, is that this rule of

I believe that this Court in Allen versus

9

McCurry laid that assumption to rest once and for all.

10

There is no universal right to be in the federal court

11

to litigate Fourth Amendment claims.

12

for a claim in this case to have been raised would have

13

been during the state criminal process.

14

The proper place

Section 1738, the Virginia law of preclusion apparently

should apply.

That appears to be the decision of this

18

QUESTION:

19

ME. LASSO;

20

QUESTION:

You would agree with that approach?
Yes, Ycur Honor, I would.
The problem in part is the possible

21

uncertainty about what Virginia law is.

22

have a brief filed here coming out of the Virginia Law

23

School that says that it is clear that Virginia law is

24

contrary to your position

25

MR. LASSO:

For example, we

My thought on that is that they

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

are plainly incorrect.

2

in that amicus brief nor in any of the briefs filed on

3

behalf of the Respondent is the case of Souders versus

4

Gabrielson.
QUESTION:

5

One case that they never discuss

Which has no written opinion.

You

6

cited it in your brief, but your opponent did not refer

7

to it.

8
9

MR. LASSO:

That's correct.

That case was

found by me after the Fourth Circuit decision.

It was

10

unavailable to the Fourth Circuit, but that decision is

11

a case directly on point that affirmed the Trial Court,

12

and the Virginia Supreme Court said that collateral

13

estoppel would apply to a guilty plea situation.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

What effect does Virginia give to

those unreoorted decisions?
MR. LASSO:

There is no case in the Virginia

17

Supreme Court which indicates whether it would be given

18

one particular weight or another, but the fact is is

19

that it does exist.

20

didn't have it, but when you combine the holdings in

21

Souders and then you look to the only other case that is

22

really close, which is Eagle Star and British Dominions

23

Insurance Corporation versus Feller, you see that the

24

Virginia Supreme Court has a rule which applies when the

25

convicted person is the plaintiff.

Admittedly, the Fourth Circuit

All of the other

cases cited by the Respondent and the amicus -- amici do

2

not refer to the fact that all of those cases are on the

3

other side.

4

convicted person is the plaintiff and he is trying to

5

profit from his own illegal conduct.

6

In other words, it doesn’t come up that the

QUESTlONi

But in any event you are content to

7

let it rest on whatever Virginia law would determine, I

8

take it.

9

MR- LASSO:

I would think that we are

10

commanded to do that under 1828, Section 1738.

11

of course, the Fourth Circuit said that it was unclear,

12

and it said that over and over again, that there was no

13

case, or at least a reported case, directly on point in

14

the Virginia Supreme Court that it could —

15

QUESTlONi

In fact,

Well, and then the Court of Appeals

16

proceeded to decide what Virginia law was, and normally

17

I suppose this Court defers to that kind of a

18

determination, does it not?

19

HR. LASSOi

Normally it would defer, but if

20

you read the Fourth Circuit very carefully, it never

21

decided what the Virginia Supreme Court rule was.

22

said that it was unclear, it could not find anything,

23

and then it went on to develop broad principles of

24

collateral estoppel which it said it felt that the

25

Virginia Supreme Court would also accept, and I would

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

It

1

submit to this Court that the Virginia Supreme Court

2

would never accept a flat rule of nonpreclusion if that

3

rule would allow someone like Mr. Prosise to bring into

4

question the very integrity of his state court

5

conviction.

6

There is no escaping the fact in this case but

7

that if Mr. Prosise is allowed to pursue his claim under

8

Section 1983, he will question the integrity of that

9

conviction.

The search that he seeks to litigate is the

10

search that produced the evidence of the crime.

11

not a search that had nothing to do with this case.

much narrower than that, being that there was a factual

13

QUESTION s

May I ask you if you would make the

14

same basic argument if you had a case in which there

15

were, say, two diffe rant se ts o f evidence that supported

16

the guilty plea, one of which was — there was no

17

challenge to the legality of the seizure, but as to some

18

of the evidence there was a question as to the legality

19

of the seizure, and then he pleaded guilty, and the

20

undisputed evidence would be enough to support the

21

guilty plea, but he nevertheless files a 1983 action

22

just like this, saying there is some kind of a

23

constitutional right to damages.

24

with that kind of a case?

25

MR. LASSO;

Row would you deal

It presents a difficult question.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

The question, even if the Fourth Circuit*s rule was

2

adopted, in a sense, that aspect of it which is

3

incentive to litigate, you could inquire nonetheless

4

into the incentive to litigate that other search.

5

other words, was there still some evidence —

6

QUESTIONS

What would be the incentive?

7

just cumulative evidence of a crime of which he is

8

admittedly guilty.

9

HR. LASSOs

In

It is

Well, the position would be that

10

he should nonetheless, if there is evidence there that

11

is at all important, then he should raise that at the

12

first opportunity.

13

QUESTIONS

But what is the purpose?

I mean,

14

why should he make a judge go through a hearing on all

15

that if it is not going to accomplish anything?

16

MR. LASSOs

Well, the next question is, why

17

should he deliberately bypass that opportunity and then

18

litigate it later and not be —

19

QUESTIONS

Because it is relevant to a damage

20

claim and totally irrelevant to a guilty plea

21

determination.

22

HR. LASSOs

If that position were taken, then

23

that would at least eliminate the second search.

In

24

other words, he would be precluded on the second search,

25

which was essential evidence of the crime, and at least

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

you would have a rule

2

3QESTI0N:

Yes, if tie doesn't challenge that.

3

I am just saying there is no constitutional issue as to

4

some of the evidence, and that is enough to support the

5

guilty plea, but there is a constitutional issue as to a

6

seizure and a search which he doesn't want to bother

7

litigating in the criminal trial because there is no

8

purpose to it, but he does want to assert a damage

9

claim.

10

11

Why shouldn't he be allowed to do that?
MR. LASSO:

If it had nothing to do with the

conviction, if the evidence was —

12

QUESTION:

13

there, but he pleaded guilty.

14

MR. LASSO:

Well, it was cumulative.

It was

Then an argument would be, you

15

could then again look to state law if it were clear, but

16

perhaps that is one instance when that search might be

17

litigated in a 1933 action.

18

would be this aspect of waiver that has been commented

19

on heavily in my briefs.

20

looked at the case of Tollett versus Henderson, and in

21

that case he was faced with a situation where it was

22

clear that antecedent constitutional infirmities could

23

not be raised when someone's very liberty was at stake,

24

and he had to ask himself the question of whether it

25

made sense to then say that although you can’t seek your

Now, another consideration

The trial judge, Judge Bryan,

1U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

liberty, you could then seek, money damages.
Now, Tollett versus Henderson is admittedly a

2
3

habeas corpus case.

There is no question about that.

4

And it is stretching to case to say that it ends every

5

inquiry here, ends all prior unconstitutional conduct,

6

but there is an underlying policy consideration, it

7

seems to me, in Tollett that stands for the proposition

8

that the kinds of issues like Fourth Amendment claims,

9

they should be raised during the state process, and if

10

they are not raised, and if you taka advantage of the

11

plea bargain, there shouldn't be a time when you can

12

later coma back and raise those claims.

13

finality must attach, and I think that that is the

14

policy consideration of Tollett.
2UESTI0N:

15
16

You fail to draw the difference

between criminal and civil, do you not?
NR. LASSO:

17
18

At some point

I am saying that the policy

consideration is similar.
2UESTI0N:

19

You say the criminal case, when you

20

end a criminal case, you also end the civil case.

Justice Marshall, I am saying that

during the criminal case, all inquiries into the claims

24

that were relevant to that criminal case should be

ended.

There should be finality.

question is, is what kinds of claims should be ended,

13

and it seems to me that the kind of claim that should be

MR. LASSO;

Well, what Johnson —
Not infer it.
Excuse me, Justice Marshall.

What

17

I believe Johnson versus Zerbst says is that there must

18

be an intelligent relinquishment of a known right.

19

Johnson versus Zerbst does not say that every

20

conceivable cause of action, if it is statutory or

21

common law, has to be outlined.

22

doesn't need to be some litany recited to the defendant

That’s correct.

However, when

5

these types of claims are brought, what he has asked for

6

in his relief in Joint Appendix Page 12 and 13 is, he

7

asks for relief in the amount of $2,725,000, claiming

8

that the conviction has ruined the rest of his life, and

9

for the worry ha is going through while he spends his

time in the penitentiary.

That is — even if you lose this

MR. LASSO:

That's correct.

That's what I'm

saying, that it then becomes a more difficult question

of what happens when you win a motion to suppress.

QUESTION:

I understood one of your underlying

16

propositions when you were talking about the burden on

17

the courts was that the courts should not be burdened

18

with having to determine for a second time whether this

was or was not an unreasonble search, and that his

20

guilty plea was a waiver of any claim whatever that it

21

was an unreasonable search.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORMAN A. TOWNSEND, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. TOWNSEND;

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, the fundamental question

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

before the Court today is whether the exclusionary rule

2

is to become the sole and exclusive remedy for

3

intentional Fourth Amendment violations in instances

4

when the search in question resulted in the seizure of

5

evidence or contraband.
Petitioners argue that the Fourth Circuit has

6

7

abandoned settled law to create a remedy benefitting

8

only convicted felons.
QUESTION;

10

He was represented by counsel at

the guilty plea, I take it.
MR. TOWNSEND;

11

He was, Your Honor.

Eut in

12

Volume 1, which is the pleadings filed in this Court,

13

Tab 13, Hr. Prosise filed a memorandum in opposition to

14

defendant’s motion to dismiss and for summary judgment

15

in which he has a section entitled "Ineffective

16

Assistance of Counsel."
QUESTION;

case?

21

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

And in the last

Let me be sure I have that clear.

22

He was raising in the 1983 case a claim of ineffective

23

assistance of counsel at the time of his guilty plea?

24
25

HR. TOWNSEND;

Yes, sir.

He stated, and I

quote, "Plaintiff states that he never had adequate

assistance of counsel throughout his pretrial, trial,

2

and post-trial procedures."

3

QUESTION;

Well, do you know of any authority

4

that allows the setting aside of a guilty plea in a 1983

5

action?
MR. TOWNSEND;

6

He is not attempting to set

7

aside the guilty plea, Your Honor.

I think that goes to

8

the question of whether there was adequate incentive to

9

litigate, or whether the procedures leading to the

10

guilty plea were adequate. ' He was stating that the

11

reason that no search and seizure issue was -- I mean,

12

motion was raised at the trial level was because he was

13

ineffectively assisted by trial counsel.

once a court has decided an issue of fact or law that is

21

actually necessary to the judgment, that the decision

22

may preclude, not does automatically, but may preclude

23

relitigation of that issue in a subsequent civil rights

24

action.

25

of whether it precludes issues not actually raised and

2

The Court also disclaimed fashioning any new,

3

more stringent variety of collateral estoppel for 1983

4

cases raising Fourth Amendment issues.

5

time, the Court disclaimed that it was creating a rule

6

of collateral estoppel that turns on the single question

7

of whether the 1983 plaintiff had a full and fair

8

opportunity to litigate the question in state court.

At the same

-- that you were merely applying the conventional

doctrine of collateral estoppel.

12

doctrine of collateral estoppel has been established in

federal court since 1876, in the case of Cromwell versus

14

Sack County, and the Court — and Petitioners in this

15

case are asking this Court to disturb well-settled

16

collateral estoppel law by abandoning the rule that the

judgment.

MR. TOWNSEND;

No, they waived valid defenses.

3

Tollett versus Henderson would seem to imply that there

4

is — although Tollett is not exactly a waiver case, as

5

this Court has pointed out in Menna, but that those then

6

become irrelevant to the question of factual guilt.

7

Prosise is not challenging his factual guilt.

8

he is seeking to litigate a separate, entirely separate

9

question, that is, whether aside from his guilt of the

Mr.

Rather,

10

underlying offense, another violation of law occurred by

11

the police officers in this instance.

12

I would also point out that Petitioners seem

13

to have conceded in their argument that were there

14

untainted evidence in the case to support the guilty

15

plea, that their position would be that they were not

16

precluded from litigating that question.

17

I would point out in the record in this case

18

that there was in fact untainted evidence sufficient to

19

support a factual finding of guilt in this case.

20

Joint Appendix at Page 24 is reproduced the search

21

warrant affidavit, and in the search warrant affidavit

22

it indicates that after arresting Mr. Prosise for the

23

domestic dispute that prompted the police in coming to

24

his apartment in the first instance, that they patted

25

him down as a search incident to the arrest and found

phencyclidine in his pocket.
Also, having disarmed him in the house, his

3

fiance with whom he was having the dispute told the

4

officers that Mr. Prosise was manufacturing PCP.

5

together with the phencyclidine found in his pocket and

6

the statements of his fiance, there was sufficient

7

evidence in the record aside from the evidence seized by

8

going through the closets of Mr. Prosise’s house with

9

which to support a finding of guilt.

10

So,

I would point out that this Court made very

11

clear in Allen that 28 USC 1738 controls, that Virginia

12

law as a result must be looked to to determine the

13

preclusive effect of the guilty plea in this case.

14

Petitioners have relied to a great extent in their reply

15

brief and today in oral argument on the denial of the

16

writ of error in Souders versus Gabrielson.

17

I would point out to the Court that in

18

Brunswick County versus Peebles and Purdy, which is

19

reported at

20

and I will quote very briefly, "The effect of the

21

refusal of the writ of error in the former case was to

22

affirm the decision of the court below in that

23

particular case, but the refusal of the writ did not

24

decide the question in any other case."

14

particularly in light of the question — in light of the

fact that Virginia law, although there is no Supreme

MR. TOWNSEND*

It would be a closer question,

3

to be sure, had it been rendered by the United — I

4

mean, by the Virginia Supreme Court, because it is a

5

Fourth Amendment question in some respects, although the

6

Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals was looking for an issue

7

dealing with the admissibility of evidence on Fourth

8

Amendment grounds, and this — the court — the Fourth

9

Circuit Court of Appeals was very carefully to narrowly

10

construe or narrowly answer that particular question and

11

no other question.

12

question of whether any 1983 issue might be precluded,

13

and whether issue elements might be precluded because

14

there was no Virginia Supreme Court on point.

15

though Souders may have been decided by the Virginia

16

Supreme Court, because it did not involve the particular

17

question that the Fourth Circuit was looking at, which

18

is the admissibility of evidence, then it probably,

that such persuasive effect that they may have reached a

It was not.

To remand.

SR. TOWNSEND;

— or would probably remand to

12

the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of

13

that decision, but I would point out again that the

14

Virginia Supreme Court has expressly said that denial of

15

writ of error is a discretionary review, and such

16

denials have no precedential effect.

17

QUESTION;

Well, Sr. Townsend, do you see the

18

inquiry to be made by a Court of Appeals or a District

19

Court here in determining what state law is for purposes

20

of preclusion to be any different than the inquiry of a

21

state -- of a federal court sitting in a diversity case

22

trying to ascertain what state law is?

23

SR. TOWNSEND;

I believe that there is some

24

difference in the fact that a 1983 action is different

25

than a diversity action.

A 1983 action has a special

QUESTION*

But so far as preclusion is

concerned, I gather that the focus of the Fourth Circuit

Virginia law is such and such is — the object is to

6

find out what Virginia law is.
MR. TOWNSEND;

7

I believe that if this Court —

8

our position is that the Virginia law is settled that

9

criminal convictions, whether by plea or by trial, have

10

no collateral estoppel effect in Virginia.

11

the Court were to agree with the Fourth Circuit Court of

12

Appeals that that question remains unsettled, then the

13

Court may look to general rules of collateral estoppel

14

which reach the same result as the Court of Appeals

said.

MR. TOWNSEND;

I will certainly give him the

opportunity.
QUESTION;

I just wanted to ask you — I thank

4

you, Brother Marshall -- is it not a fact that in the

5

Souders case the plea of guilty was to assault and

6

battery of a police officer, which was flatly

7

inconsistent with the civil claim of excessive force, so

8

that that case is quite different from this?

9
10

MR. TOWNSEND;
QUESTION;

It is.

Here, there is nothing inconsistent

11

with the plea of guilty to possession of controlled

12

substances and still having an illegal search, but there

13

it seems to me it is -- I don’t know why we have to

14

wrestle with that case.

15

MR. TOWNSEND;

I don't believe that we do.

I

16

don't believe that that question is on point. I don't

17

believe that it deals with the issue that the Fourth

18

Circuit Court of Appeals was looking to answer that said

19

that the Virginia Supreme Court had not addressed, and I

20

don *t believe that we need deal with Souders at any

21

length at all.

22

The Virginia rule is clear that three factors

23

must exist in order for collateral estoppel to apply

24

that do not exist in this case.

25

has been actually litigated.

That is that the issue

That is that the decision

was necessary to the judgment below.

2

the conviction, as Petitioners continue to argue.

3

Petitioners continue to argue that without this

4

evidence, there could have been no conviction, that the

5

requirement for collateral estoppel is that without the

6

litigation of the question that Mr. Prosise now seeks to

7

litigate, there could have been no decision below.

8

9

Not necessary to

And the third requirement that Virginia
requires is mutuality of judgment.

That is, had the

10

decision reached the opposite result, that the

11

Petitioners would have been precluded.

12

that Petitioners would not have been precluded from

13

defending against this charge had the trial court

14

litigated the issue and decided that it was an illegal

15

sea rch.

16

And it is clear

3o, in order to find as Petitioners would have

17

the Court do on collateral estoppel grounds under

18

Virginia law we are going -- the Court would have to

19

abandon those three requirements, but even if the Court

20

were to look to collateral estoppel law as established

21

in the federal courts, although the federal courts have

22

abandoned in Park Lane Hosiery the requirement of

23

mutuality of judgment, the federal court still adhered

24

to the rule that the issue must have been actually

25

litigated and necessary to the decision.

inappropriate, so as recently as March 7th of 1983, this

collateral estoppel that the issue be actually

It indicated that were the

Turning to the question of whether the Circuit

11

Court rendered an inflexible rule but rather we should

look to incentive to ligitate, I would point out that

13

that would be adding an entirely new level of inquiry at

14

the summary judgment stage in 1983 actions. That has a

15

very difficult -- that is very difficult to resolve,

16

which is exactly what the Fourth Circuit pointed out.

17

It would raise questions of fact that are inappropriate

18

for summary judgment disposition.

19

questions of what is the burden of proof, who has the

20

burden of proof, is there untainted evidence, are there

MR. TOWNSEND;

I think the question of whether

5

definitely would be precluded, absent a claim of

ineffective assistance of counsel that could then be

MR. TOWNSEND;

The -- I don't believe there

22

was a finding of consent to the search.

I think there

23

was a footnote in the District Court opinion saying that

24

it would appear that Ms. Denny, who was Mr. Prosise's

25

f ia nee and living in the apartment, gave consent, but I

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

would point out that in the record in the District

2

Court, Ms. Denny filed an affidavit contesting that,

3

saying that she did not in fact consent to the search,

4

so that is a disputed fact that would have to be

5

resolved aside from a -- on a summary judgment motion.

6

I think again the District Court neglected to

7

look at that.

8

largely from the affidavits submitted by the officers in

9

support of their summary judgment motion, and overlooked

I think the District Court took the facts

10

the affidavits of Ks. Denny and the verified nature of

11

the complaint.

12

did intimate an opinion as to the legality of the

it was erroneous, and with not the benefit of looking at

QUESTION;

4

So you say the District Court

5

didn’t grant summary judgment on the merits of the

6

Fourth Amendment claim?

7

ME. TOWNSEND;

No, the District Court did

8

not.

The District Court did state that on initial

9

looking at the claims, it would appear that the merits

10

— or looking at the merits, it would appear that the

11

search was valid, but I don’t reach that because he is

12

collaterally estopped from getting there, or if he is

13

not collaterally estopped, then he has waived his right

14

by pleading guilty.

15

Turning to the waiver ques tion, I think the

16

court was clearly incorrect and rath er the Circui t Court

17

is correct that there was no wa iver arising from that.

18

that the rationale for Tollett versus Henderson is that

19

individuals should not be permitted to come into court

20

and then contest the fact that they are actually guilty

21

by way of habeas corpus in an effort to seek their

22

release from custody to vacate and set aside the

23

conviction itself.

24
25

Tollett, of course, was not a waiver case at
all, as this Court has said.

Tollett was limited to

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

habeas corpus challenges to the conviction, and Mr.

2

Prosise is not seeking declaratory injunctive relief

3

that his conviction was invalid, but rather is seeking

4

to litigate the entirely separate question of whether

5

the police officers committed a violation of the law.

6

I think Preiser versus Rodrigez, this Court

7

made clear that habeas corpus and money damages under

8

1983 are entirely separate and distinct remedies, and

9

that the policy considerations I think this Court

10

indicated in Allen itself, the policy considerations

11

underlying habeas corpus have no application to the 1983

12

context.

13

decision precluding individuals from subsequently coming

14

into court and contesting the validity of their

15

conviction have no application in this case.

16

So that the rationale supporting the Tollett

I think, rather, if the Court is going to look

17

at the waiver principle in the case, the Court should

18

look at the Wainwright versus Sykes deliberate bypass

19

considerations.

20

that there arises a waiver from this, because in Tollett

21

versus Henderson the Court said that where the

22

individual waives or bypasses a state procedure that

23

then forecloses them from habeas corpus relief, that you

24

can't come and get habeas corpus relief in state — or,

25

rather, in federal court.

I don’t think that even in those cases

But that is inapposite to

CHIEF JUSTICE BUR GER;

2

Do you have anything further, Hr. Lasso?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID R. LASSO, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

5

MR. LASSOi

8

remarks on rebuttal.

Very well.

Mr. Chief Justice, a few brief

The point was made that he had no

7

8

opportunity.

9

seriously.

I don't think that claim can be taken
There is no question here but that he had

10

opportunity to make a motion to suppress.

11

also overlooks the fact of the ease with which a motion

12

to suppress could have made.

13

complicated or difficult about making a motion to

14

suppress.

15

I think it

There is nothing

The other point made,

which hints, and it was

16

in response to a question by the Chief Justice, was the

17

anomaly that will be created when you are dealing with

18

the trial situation, and that is, if a person goes to

19

trial and litigates the claim, then the Respondent would

20

say that he is precluded.

21

same person goes to trial, does not litigate the claim,

22

what happens to that Fourth Amendent issue?

23

However, what happens if that

The Fourth Circuit said in Cramer versus

24

Crutchfield that is a waiver.

25

Fourth Amendment claim.

He cannot litigate that

So the question is, what is the

52

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

difference between Cramer versus Crutchfield when you

2

have a trial and you don't raise the claim, and here,

3

when you have a plea of guilty and you don't raise the

4

claim?
The police officers would submit that there is

5

6

no practical difference.

There is no question but that

7

in each instance a court can look and determine the

8

incentive to litigate, and here, he had 40 years facing

9

him.

He had every incentive in the world.

He could

10

have litigated that issue.

11

the federal courts should not then be burdened with

12

litigating before a jury the question of a search when

13

it could have been litigated easily in the state court

14

processes.

15

He chose not to do so, and

What needs to be clarified here is, this is a

16

plea of guilty to manufacturering PCP.

17

to possession.

18

there was sufficient other evidence here of

19

manufacturing simply because his fiance in a fit of

20

emotion said, he is making PCP.

21

It is not a plea

I don't think that it can be argued that

The trial judge said very clearly when the

22

plea was made, the factual basis of the plea this

23

morning that I am accepting is what I hav e heard today,

24

and that was the evidence p roduced by the search.

25

Later, Mr. Prosise tried to withdraw that plea.

He

53

1

tried to assert his innocence, and the trial judge said,

2

once again, I will not allow you to withdraw your plea

3

because I have already heard sufficient factual basis to

4

find you guilty, and that is the evidence of the search.

5

So, there is no question here but that that

6

evidence was crucial, it was important, and that is what

7

he was convicted on.
QUESTIONS

8

10

Could he have then made a motion to

suppress?
NR. LASSO:

It may be that at that point -- it
It may have been too late ,

11

was the sentencing hearing.

12

but he never even raised that issue.

13

failed to make the point that the search was illegal.

14

If he ever claimed that, why didn't he make it?

15

Once again, he

What this case really presents is a

16

fundamental policy question.

17

a rule which encourages litigants like Mr. Prosise to

18

deliberately bypass the opportunities afforded to him in

19

the state criminal process?

20

ars designed to protect his civil rights.

21

allow him in the criminal context to challenge the

22

conduct of the police officers.

QUESTION:

Should this Court endorse

Those same opportunities
They would

I suppose the state would perhaps

rather have no exclusionary rule at all?
MR. LA330:

I am sure many people would

support the taking away of
QUESTION;

In which event if the Fourth

3

Amendment means anything there would be suits for

4

unlawful searches.

5

SR. LASSO;

That's correct.

The fact is,

6

however, the exclusionary rule does exist, but if it

7

didn't exist, we would then be left under 1738 to in a

8

sense begin to look closer at state law, what will the

9

states do if the federal court eliminates the

10

exclusionary rule?

11

time is up.

12

The state courts -- I see that my

In conclusion, I would simply ask this Court

13

to adopt a rule of judicial administration that will

14

preclude Sr. Prosise from bringing his claim and ask

15

this Court to reverse the Fourth Circuit.
