ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. GOLD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

This case concerns the scope of 42 U.S.C.

8

Section 1935(3), the lineal descendent provision of

9

Section 2 of the 1871 Civil Rights Act.

As the Court of

10

Appeals majority stated, this case grows out of an

11

episode of mob violence at the Alligator Bayou Pumping

12

Station construction site near Port Arthur, Texas that

13

caused both serious injuries and substantial property

14

damage.

15

That wrongdoing led to this federal court suit

16

brought by two individuals and by the general contractor

17

at that job site and to avert it in favor of the

18

plaintiffs and against three local unions which are the

19

petitioners here.

20

the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc split 14 to nine

21

concern the meaning of the phrases "equal protection of

22

the laws” and "equal privileges and immunities under the

23

laws" as used in Section 1585(3).

24
25

QUESTION:

The basic legal questions on which

Mr. Gold, why would a plaintiff or

group of plaintiffs file a suit under Section 1985(3)

instead of a state tout action?

2

recovery potentially of attorney’s fees or what?

3

MR. GOLDi

Is it because of the

I am hard pressed to understand

4

that myself, Justice O’Connor.

5

here was that this would be a more effective law suit

6

from the plaintiffs’ standpoint despite the --

7

9

QUESTION*

I take it that the hope

You think that would center around

the recovery of attorney’s fees question?
MR. GOLD*

That is, certainly in light of the

10

Civil Rights Act attorney’s fees statute, that could

11

well be a motive, and the countervailing — why the

12

plaintiffs were not impressed by the countervailing

13

consideration that there are very, very difficult legal

14

questions here and a straightforward tort case in the

15

state court system, I am really not privy to —

16

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose in Beaumont, Port

17

Arthur you have got elected judges and there might be

18

some feeling that you do not get quite the same

19

neutrality from elected judges as you do from lifetime

20

federal judges.

21

MR. GOLD*

There are also appellate judges in

22

Texas up and down the system, and I can only say that

23

there isn't a whisper in this record that the state

24

justice system was not open to and fully protective of

25

the rights and interests of plaintiff companies and

non-union employees in the State of Texas.

Indeed,

2

there were 13 indictments growing out of this episode,

3

three convictions, two people in jail for substantial

4

terms indeed.

5

garden variety case for choosing a federal court as

6

opposed to a state court.

So in all those respects this is not your

The en banc majority below analyzed Section

7

8

1985(3) as requiring a showing aside from the conspiracy

9

and acts pursuant to the conspiracy and injury are the

10

violation of some protected right and moreover

11

class-based invidiously discriminatory animus motivating

12

the invasion of that right and motivating the

13

conspiracy.

14

association is such a protected right and, indeed,

15

analyzed the matter as comprising a protected right

16

under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

The court found that the right

c,

That court rejected our contention that for

17
18

1985(3), as is generally true, to show the invasion of a

19

First and Fourteenth Amendment right as opposed to the

20

invasion of the rights guaranteed by the Thirteenth

21

Amendment or the rights guaranteed by the right of

22

travel.

23

There has to be a showing of state action.
That court took the view that the contention I

24

have just outlined had been rejected in Griffin v.

25

Breckenridge, this Court’s leading modern case on the

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

scope of Section 1985(3).

2

we have quoted at page 39 of our opening brief, the blue

3

brief, the analysis of this issue by Justice Stevens in

4

Novotny.

5

We cannot improve upon, and

We rest on that analysis and in terms of an

8

analysis of the statute, neither the court below nor the

7

respondents challenge the accuracy of the insights

8

stated there.

9

10

Rather both contend that that view of the
It is our view that

Griffin simply did not address this problem.

11

Griffin was a case involving a conspiracy

12

aimed at black Americans attempting to assert their

13

civil rights and those who would assist them.

14

analyzed the matter as resting on the Thirteenth

15

Amendment base and the right and power of Congress to do

16

away with the badges and incidence of slavery.

17

The court

It is perfectly well settled that Congress in

18

no way, shape, or form is limited by a state action

19

requirement in those regards and that those

20

constitutional rights, both the rights vouchsafed by the

21

Thirteenth Amendment and the rights stated by the right

22

of travel are protected against private interferences.

23

QUESTIONi

Can you think of any more rights,

24

Mr. Gold, that would fall on that side of the line that

25

Justice Stevens drew?

1

MR. GOLDi

From our view of the cases, Justice

2

Rehnguist, we know of no other constitutional rights

3

which are, of those stated in the Thirteenth,

4

Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendment, which do no have a

5

state action component to them.

6

surprising that Congress would be particularly concerned

7

about Thirteenth Amendment rights in terms of the 1871

8

Act because the voluminous legislative history is

9

instinct on every page with a desire to protect the

And it is hardly

10

rights of the newly enfranchised freedmen and to ensure

11

that the wrongdoing that was taking place in the South

12

against them would have a federal remedy.

13

At the same time, Section 2, which was the

14

point of controversy in the 1871 Act, was shaped by the

15

moderate Republicans in the House who were not only

16

mindful of that major interest and concern, the one I

17

have just outlined, but also saw an important value in

18

maintaining a system of federalism at the time as they

19

understood that system.

20

strong controversy that Section 2, as originally

21

introduced, created, which has been noted by this Court

22

in numerous decisions, concerned how to advance both

23

these values.

24
25

The debate in the House and the

If there had only been one value, the need to
end what was seen by every segment of the majority party

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

at that tine, the Republicans, as outrages in the South,

2

there would have been no division, no compromise, no

3

internal controversy in the House.
But there was this understanding of the fact

4
5

that there were two values and a desire to put down Klan

6

violence without doing violence to the Thirteenth,

7

Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments as the moderate

8

Republicans understood those amendments.

9

prevailed.

The moderates

The Section 2 was rewritten in response to

10

Representative Garfield's speech, which we have laid out

11

at perhaps overly great length in our brief.

12

There is no doubt when you read the debate

13

that Section 2 of the 1871 Act was redrafted to meet

14

that speech and had probably been redrafted before the

15

speech was given because it concludes with

16

Representative Garfield saying I'm confident that

17

language can be drafted which will meet these concerns,

18

concerns about the federal government intruding into the

19

proper state domain and becoming the primary guarantor

20

of property and individual rights.

21

Low and behold the next day Representative

22

Shellabarger, who was managing the bill, comes in and

23

says here is an amendment presented by friends of this

24

legislation to assure that we can go forward, and the

25

amendment, by adding the terms "equal protection of the

8

\

1

laws" and "equal privileges and immunities of the laws",

2

met precisely the lines and the concerns stated by

3

Representative Garfield.
If we are right in that point, since there is

4
5

not a hint of state action in this case, the decision

6

below must be reversed.

7

if the statute is viewed as protecting basic

8

constitutional rights against private conspiracy where

9

there is no state action, we think the same result

But even if it is viewed, even

10

follows, because the court below was of the view that

11

working for a non-union employer is a First Amendment

12

right.
It is our understanding based on this Court's

13
14

cases that the particular economic relations between

15

employers and employees is not governed by the First

16

Amendment but is governed by state law and Congress'

17

power to enact legislation pursuant to the commerce

18

clause.
QUESTION;

19

You do not think the right to work

20

for a union employer stands on any different footing

21

than the right to work for a non-union employer?
MR. GOLD;

22

So.

If Smith v. Arkansas does not

23

take away our dreams on that point, I do not know what

24

will.

25

QUESTION;

You would not like it, would you?

22

MR. GOLD;

No.

I think we had as much

23

substantive due process as we could stand through the

24

first third of this century, but it is our understanding

25

and our view that insofar as the state regulates whether

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

there will be a collective bargaining system or there

will be a system of managerial prerogative and insofar

as the state regulates whether individuals will work in

a system where terms and conditions are set one way or

another and insofar as the state regula-tes even a matter

such as, or the Congress in each instance, regulates

those are not First

There is no right of economic freedom of

10
11

association of the kind the Court of Appeals was talking

12

about any more than there is a right of free association

13

to set up certain kinds of corporations or certain kinds

14

of partnerships of the kind entrepreneurs may find

15

beneficial to their interest free and clear of state

regulation of the field.

Amendment.
QUESTION

20

But I was wondering about the right

21

of an individual to make a choice as to where he wishes

22

to work and with and for whom.
MR. GOLDi

23

I do not believe that an individual

24

has such a constitutional right under the First

25

Amendment.

Let me —

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

QUESTION;

1

2

Under any provision of the

Constitution --

3

MR* GOLD;

I know of no provision.

4

QUESTION;

This sounds like the Soviet Union

5

to me where they tell you where you can work and where

6

you cannot.

7

QUESTION;

How about the Thirteenth Amendment?

8

MR. GOLD;

I was wondering about that.

9

I do

not think that if, for example -- let me try to grapple

10

with the question in this way.

If in a particular area

11

there are no places of employment where unions have

12

succeeded in becoming majority representatives as

13

provided for in the National Labor Relations Act, I do

14

not think an individual could sue anybody on the view

15

that he was being deprived of his right to work under

18

union conditions.
On the other hand, if unions succeeded in

17
18

organizing the places of employment in the locality, I

19

do not believe that the opposite law suit would lie,

20

either.

21

Perhaps this is the clearest I can be in answering this.

22

I believe that the individual has a freedom to

23

move from place to place and to look for employment that

24

suits him.

25

constitutional right to demand that certain conditions

Obviously the individual has a freedom.

I do not believe that he has a

1

2

obtain
The second element that the Court of Appeals

3

understood to be encompassed in Section

4

least in the aspect we are discussing here, the equal

5

protection of the laws and equal privileges and

6

immunities of the laws aspect of the statute, is a

7

requirement that there be a showing of class-based

8

invidiously discriminatory animus and that court

9

segmented that requirement as follows;

10

1985(3) or at

First the court stated that such animus is

11

shown if there is animus against a class of those with

12

common characteristics of an inherent nature and

13

secondly, a particular application here, recognizing

14

that there was no such class, the Court of Appeals said

15

that the statute also encompasses conspiracies motivated

16

by an animus of the kind Congress was trying to protect

17

against in enacting the 1871 Act.

18

The Court of Appeals read the legislative

19

history of the 1871 Act to show an intent to act against

20

conspiracies motivated by an animus against exercises of

21

the right of economic association, which exercises of

22

that right ignite regional hostility.

23

that that dramatically overreads the statute and

24

Congress' intent therein.

25

It is our view

Se know what the core of what Congress sought

13

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to do was.

2

were seeking to assure that the freedmen secured the

3

rights provided by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and

4

Fifteenth Amendment.

5

history is instinct with that intention except for

6

scattered passages and in the very considerable

7

legislative history debated, I might say, at a very high

8

and intense level given the gravity of the moment, there

9

are no other references to a congressional intent.

10

It was to protect the freedmen and those who

Every page of the legislative

In Griffin the Court left open the question of

11

whether any intent under other than racial animus or

12

bias supports a 1985(3) cause of action.

13

position that given the fact that this is a statute

14

stated in general terms, one can generalize from the

15

particular concerns of Congress.

16

It is our

Me would formulate the animus test as

17

class-based animus against those who have common

18

characteristics of an inherent nature who are offered

19

special protection under the Equal Protection Clauses

20

and in that sense that is the first part of what the

21

Court of Appeals understood class-based animus to be and

22

those who are aiding the former to secure that

23

protection.

24

The area, I think, of legitimate dispute is

25

what is one to make of the repeated references in the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

legislative history to the interest in protecting not

2

only the freedman but Republicans and Northerners and

3

others who were also the object of the Klan.

4

legislative materials we set out, both in our opening

5

brief and at pages 11 to 18 of our reply brief, it seems

6

to us apparent that the understanding at the time was

7

that those in addition to the freedmen who were to be

8

protected were the individuals who were seeking to

9

assure the protections to that group of Americans

In the

10

guaranteed by the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth

11

Amendments.
It was not Republicans as such.

12

It was not

13

the Northerners as such.

14

embarked in the enterprise of making those amendments

15

real.
QUESTION;

16

It was to those who were

Mr. Gold, what if say up in Vermont

17

the natives of Vermont have the same attitude toward

18

Democrats that many Southerners at that time had towards

19

the Republicans.

20

up to Vermont and was set upon that he would have an

21

action under this section?

Do you think that if a Democrat went

22

MR. GOLD:

The —

23

QUESTION:

Nothing to do with freedmen,

SR. GOLD;

No.

24
25

obviously.
We would think that the

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

comparable situations that one can envisage that the

2

statute would extend to would be those such as actions

3

against Japanese-Americans at the beginning of the

4

Second World War is a possibility, but we do not believe

5

that Congress had any intent in going beyond classes

6

that are defined by more than the fact that people are

7

doing certain things which other people do not like and

8

therefore are set upon.

9

Indeed, the broadest statement, that of

10

Senator Edmunds, which is relied on, and it is wholly

11

unique in this entire legislative history, proposes an

12

antithesis between feuds which are generated by

13

particular activities that individuals do not like and

14

class-based animus.

15

So my answer to your question would be that

16

the weight of the legislative evidence is that the

17

protection extends to classes of inherent

18

characteristics who are the objects of discrimination

19

and depravation —

20

QUESTION;

Would illegitimates be such a class?

21

NR. GOLD;

Under this Court's cases in the

22

development of Fourteenth Amendment law, that might be.

23

Again, while I do not think it was a subject of

24

interest, immediate interest to the 1871 Congress, women

25

could be such a class.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

The question is is it a class marked by an
inherent characteristic —

3

QUESTION;

Discrete, insular --

4

HR. GOLD;

Right, and is the animus against

5

either the people of that class or those who were

6

assisting members of that class to enjoy the full

7

panoply of rights stated in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth,

8

and Fifteenth Amendments.

9

QUESTION;

Mr. Gold, the Slaughterhouse case

10

set a law there,, did it not?

11

MR. GOLD;

If it —

12

QUESTION;

Nobody pays any attention to it any

13
14
15

more, but that is an awful clear language in that.
MR. GOLD;

We have pondered whether that case

throws light on it, and in a sense —

16

QUESTION;

Do you think it is just dead?

17

MR. GOLD;

We are not sure.

18

QUESTION;

I might breathe some life in it.

MR. KEITH;

Mr. Keith.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.
At the outset of my presentation, may I revert
to the facts momentarily, and we might start with the

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

dissent of the Fifth Circuit who called this an

2

unprovoked and brutal attack on law-abiding citizens.
The trial court in his opinion which is in the

3
4

Joint Appendix stated that this arose out of a

5

demonstration or citizen protest where people were

6

voicing concern over outside, non-union workers in a

7

union area much like the Vermonter, the Northerner, who

8

was traveling to the South in Reconstruction times.
These two statements were based on fact, and

9
10

they ware best capsulated by the attorney for defendant

11

in the opening statement to the trial court when he

12

said, and it becomes important to the legislative

13

history, what happened here -- and this is the attorney

14

for the defendant -- what happened here arises from the

15

fact that the labor organizations are strong in this

16

area

17

employing people from outside the state.

when outside contractors come into the area

Just as Senator Edmund in 1871 was concerned

18
19

with the Northerner, the Vermonter, the Republican, the

20

Democrat, the Methodist, the Catholic and the recently

21

freed man, this case comes as close factually to any

22

mind this, if I may pursue it a moment more, when we

We are not speaking about some violation of a

We are speaking about the animus,

NR. KEITH;

10

If they were conspiracies.

Then yes.
-- but only if there is that

conspiracy with that class-based discriminatory animus.
QUESTION;

11

You say that the gist of the thing

12

is denying your clients the equal protection of the law

13

even though the State of Texas apparently is perfectly

14

willing to enforce the law against everybody

15

evenhandedly.
MR. KEITH;

16

That is correct, but that is the

Ml this does was show that the animus arose
in this violation of my equal protection.
QUESTION;

So there is really no state action

involved in all.
MR. KEITH;

That is correct.

There is no

In this case if they had not said

below?

Do you think you would have gotten a judgment

HR. KEITH:

Not without showing that there

was, in fact, this animus.

14

so circumstantially.

QUESTION:

I may have been able to do

But —
Do you think this is the theory of

the Court of Appeals that you are pushing?

HR. KEITH:

I mean, do you

12

It would be a much more difficult

No, sir.

I do not.

The Court —

Are you defending the judgment of

the Court of Appeals?

20

HR. KEITH:

21

QUESTION:

22

HR. KEITH:

We do not have to go that far.
So your answer is no?
That is basically correct.

If

23

this Court should hold that Section 5 of the Fourteenth

24

Amendment grants this power to Congress, then the Court

25

of Appeals judgment is correct on that basis.

You do not say they are wrong.

just do not want to defend it.

ME. KEITH;

We do not have to go that far.

That is a heavier load to carry than we need to carry to

prevail in this particular case.

QUESTION:

Did you present this narrower

ground to the Court of Appeals?
MR. KEITH:

No, sir.

QUESTION:

If you do not want to defend the

court below, do you want us to?

defending them?
MR. KEITH:

Your Honor, but I say that —

16

MR. KEITH;

19

I thought you were.
We can affirm my case without

going as far as we ask —

I was trying to keep you from

pulling the rug out from under yourself.

20

MR. KEITH:

21

QUESTION:

22

the judgment below.

MR. KEITH:

24

QUESTION;

25

Well who is here

Well, I am here defending them,

14

17

We

submitted the larger view to the Court of Appeals.

11

13

We did not.

Thank you, sir.
Well, you certainly are defending

That is correct, yes.
A little while ago you said you

were not, but certainly the judgment below —

Why are you afraid of the Section 5

There have been opinions of the

Court that have addressed it, as you know.

MR. KEITH;

to make, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

12

We did not think it was necessary

Well, it is not necessary to make

13

it except that — where else did Congress get the

14

authority to pass this law?
MR. KEITH;

15
16

That is probably the answer to my

question, yes.
QUESTION;

17

I still do not understand your

18

concern.

There have been opinions that have addressed

19

that question and have concluded that, indeed, Section 5

20

was the basis upon which the 1871 Act was adopted in

21

United States v. Guest.

22

MR. KEITH;

23

QUESTION;

24
25

Yes, sir.
There were six of us in that case

that thought so.
MR. KEITH;

Yes, sir.

1

May I ask you once more.

I know

2

you have covered it but I keep turning it over in my

mind.

conspiratorial activity was directed.

12

MR. KEITHs

13

Is it all of the employees of this

Yes, sir.
That is th e class.
As it tur ned out there was also a

subcontractor on the job who ha d been notified —
QUESTION;

14

But you th ink that the employees of

15

a particular employer satisfies the class concept in the

16

class-based animus language?
MR. KEITH:

17

Yes, sir, because they were

18

associated as non-union workers exercising that right,

19

not the right to work non-union but the right to

20

associate.

21

people might be at the synagogu e.

22

They were at this p lace just as the Jewish

QUESTION;

Do you thi nk they were there

23

because they wanted to be with other non-union people or

24

because they wanted a job?

2

they chose to do so.

3

QUESTION;

I thought you said this group of

people at this site had the right not just to associate,

and maybe you are saying that, too, but they had the

right to have personal security.

MR. KEITH;

They do.

They have both rights as federal citizens.
