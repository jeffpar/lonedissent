ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. GALLAGHER, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. GALLAGHER*

9

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Courts
This case turns on your determination of the

10
11

breadth of the first clause of 42 U.S.C. Section

12

1985(2), a Reconstruction Era civil rights statute.

13

case arises from the alleged mistreatment of a white

14

college football player by his coaches.

The

Respondent Kevin Rutledge attended Arizona

15
16

State University in 1977 and 1978 and played

17

intercollegiate football.

18

Kush, his former coach, two assistant coaches, and

19

Arizona State University's former athletic director.

The Petitioners are Frank

After Mr. Rutledge left Arizona State

20
21

University and transferred to the University of Nevada

22

at Las Vegas, he filed a claim with the Arizona Board of

23

Regents reciting a veritable chamber of horrors to which

24

he had been exposed while a student athlete at Arizona

25

State.

The filing of that claim was a statutory

.3

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

prerequisite to the initiation of a lawsuit in Arizona

2

against a state agency such as the Arizona Board of

3

Regents.

4

That claim was denied by Arizona and Mr.

5

Rutledge’s federal court lawsuit followed.

6

claims in the federal suit was that Mr. Kush and others

7

had conspired to intimidate witnesses in violation of 14

8

U.S.C. Section 1985(2).

9

the entire lawsuit as to all defendants.

One of his

The district court dismissed

On appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of

10
11

Appeals, as pertinent here, the Court of Appeals

12

determined that Mr. Rutledge had stated a claim under

13

the first clause of 1985(2) and specifically held that

14

there was no requirement for invidiously discriminatory

15

class-based animus in such an action.

16

This holding of the Ninth Circuit aligned it

17

with the Third Circuit and the District of Columbia

18

Circuit, which previously had ruled the same way.
QUESTION*

19

Mr. Gallagher, I would like to get

20

a time sequence straight if I could.

21

alleged intimidation of witnesses in the federal court

22

system?

23

MR. GALLAGHER*

This action

Justice Rehnquist, this

24

complaint in this lawsuit alleges that from the time Mr.

25

Rutledge filed his claim against the Arizona State

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

University Board of Eegents, which was prior to the

2

initiation of any suit, and continuing the conspiracy

3

supposedly went on.

4

Initially, there was no claim pending.

As it

5

turned out, Mr. Rutledge filed his case in federal court

6

and shortly thereafter filed virtually the same case in

7

state court, presumably to protect his one-year statute

8

of limitations under 1983.

9
10

QUESTION;

Did the federal court case go to

trial on the merits?

11

MR. GALLAGHER;

12

However, the state court case did.

13

QUESTION;

No, Justice Rehnguist.

Well then, the only case in which

14

there could have been witnesses would I'm sure be the

15

state court case.

16

MR. GALLAGHER;

My understanding of what the

17

Ninth Circuit found in that regard, Justice Rehnguist,

18

was that the language in the complaint, the continuing

19

language, if you would, if you will, suggested that

20

there was intimidation of witnesses going on after the

21

federal court case had been filed.

22

QUESTION;

Well, but there are no witnesses in

23

a case until the case has been tried.

24

potential witnesses.

25

MR. GALLAGHER;

There may be

Well, that raises the next

question. Justice Rehnquist, as to how broad 1985(1) as

2

to what is a pending action.

3

discussions as to what "attending court" means in that

4

situation.

5

There have been

But the Ninth Circuit said, while it was a

6

close question, it did state a claim and that it should

7

be remanded, and specifically suggested that the

8

district court ask Nr. Rutledge to file an amended

9

complaint setting forth in specificity the specific acts
,

•

he claimed gave rise to his cause of action.

10

11

QUESTION;

Have there been any proceedings on

12

remand in the district court?
MR. GALLAGHER;

13

There have not been, Justice

Rehnquist.

14

As I was pointing out, the circuits have split

15
16

on the question of a requirement for invidiously

17

discriminatory class-based animus in a 1985, Section 2,

18

clause 1 case.

19

conspiracies which interfere with the judicial process.

20

The language consists of two clauses separated by a

21

semicolon.

Generally speaking,

1985(2) deals with

The first clause prohibits conspiracies to

22
23

deter by force, intimidation or threat parties or

24

witnesses in the federal court processes.

25

'

The language

which follows the semicolon, the second clause.

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

prohibits conspiracies to impede, hinder, obstruct or

2

defeat due course of justice in any state or territory

3

with the intent to deny any citizen equal protection of

4

the laws.
It is the Petitioners' position that a cause

5
6

of action under either clause of 1985(2) requires a

7

finding of invidiously discriminatory class-based

8

animus.

9

that is a co-requirement under second clause or state

There seems to be no question today but that

10

action lawsuits.

That seems to be the teaching of

11

Griffin versus Breckenridge, 1971, and all five circuits

12

who have directly dealt with the question of 1985 have

3

not had any problem realizing that second clause

4

lawsuits have to be based on invidiously discriminatory

5

class-based animus because of the equal protection

6

language.

7

The diversity of opinion and the problem

8

arises because the first clause simply does not have

9

equal protection language.

We believe that the analysis

20

of this Court in Griffin versus Breckenridge applies

21

with equal vigor to the case at bar and that there

22

should be a finding that invidiously discriminatory

23

class-based animus is a requirement under either clause

24

of 1985(2).

25

In Griffin this Court did not engage in a

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

hypertechnical dissection of the syntax of the language,

2

but instead took a look at the legislative history in

'3

depth, with an eye towards the realities of what was

4

going on in this country in 1871 when the 42nd Congress

5

enacted the Ku Klux Klan Act, which of course is the

6

original Act on which both 1985(3) and 1985(2) are

7

based .

11

QUESTION;

Mr. Gallagher, why do you think the

Congress in 1871 did not include the equal protection
language in the first clause?
SR. GALLAGHER;

I think. Your Honor, that they

12

were not thinking about federal courts as much as they

13

were thinking about state courts.

14

many federal courts then.

15

jurisdiction of federal courts was much less.

16

think they needed it for a constitutional nexus because

17

under Article I, Section 8 or elsewhere, obviously,

18

there is no problem there.

19

And there were not as

The limitation on
I do not

It is very difficult. Justice O’Connor, to

20

discern what that Congress had in mind 100 years ago.

21

There is a little something in the legislative history

22

for everyone.

23

construction, statutory construction in these Civil War,

24

post-Civil War era Reconstruction statutes have given

25

lots of difficulty to statutory construction problems.

And as this Court expressed in Navatny,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

There was already a criminal statute in place#

2

Justice O’Connor, and it had been in place for 40 some

3

odd years at the time, governing people that would

4

attempt to impede witnesses in federal court.

5

know why the language was not specifically included

6

here.

7

throughout the Act because of the problems Congress had

I don’t

I believe it was included and sprinkled

QUESTION;

Well, to assure constitutionality

in its application to the states, right?
HR. GALLAGHER;

I would agree with that, yes.

12

Justice O’Connor.

13

constitutional problem with this particular law.

14

And it wasn’t — there was no

As this Court recognized in Griffin, 1985(2)

15

was initially a criminal statute, but the broad sweep of

16

the language caused the amendatory process to go into

17

gear and ultimately the civil remedies provided by

18

1985(3) were added to the Act.

19

As you said in Griffin versus Breckenridge,

20

and it's equally applicable here, the overwhelming

21

concern as expressed by the heated lengthy debates at

22

the time was with the animus or the intent required.

23

That's where all the discussion centered.

24
25

I might point out that you also said in
Griffin versus Breckenridge that that was the type of

case, involving three Mississippi blacks that had had

2

their constitutional rights impaired because they'd

3

apparently been associated with somebody someone thought

4

was a civil rights worker, was the type of case that

5

went to the core of what 1985 had in mind.

6

sub judice is a far cry from that.

They were

There is no suggestion anywhere in the

17

legislative history that the federal courts were somehow

18

pulled out and examined to see if added protection was

19

needed for the federal courts.

20

what happened in connection with the federal courts is

21

that Congress intended to provide them protection from

22

the civil upheaval being caused by the Ku Klux Klan

23

activities of the time, and there simply was no

24

independent consideration given.

25

It seems reasonable that

It is abundantly clear that the problem

1

Congress was responding to was racially and otherwise

2

motivated by Ku Klux Klan activity.

3

that there were already ample criminal statutes on hand,

4

they were not attempting — and such statutes, of

5

course, have never been construed by this Court to

6

create private causes of action, and the 42nd Congress

7

was not attempting to do that with 1985(2).
They were concerned with interference in the

8

In view of the fact

federal process, and for that matter the state process.

10

But it was only interference, we respectfully submit,

11

which was grounded on invidiously discriminatory

12

class-based animus.
Extending the coverage of 1985(2) past the

13
14

point ever intended by the Congress that enacted it will

in truth and in fact, we submit, not do one thing to

advance the cause of justice.

chilling effect or a deterring effect to people who

19

would interfere with the process.

Furthermore, the underlying activity, the

20

21

force, the coercion, the threats, are ordinarily going

22

to be able to be compensated for under state tort

action.

24
25

Lastly, in any event the Respondent here is
not a proper party to maintain this action.

This

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

statute, unlike 1985(3), does not talk in terms of

2

indirect suffering.

3

Admittedly, the only court that we were able to discern

4

which has ever addressed this proposition is a district

5

court in Maryland in 1978, but the holding was clear and

6

the holding was sound, and that was that a party does

7

not have a cause of action for interference with his

8

witnesses.

9

It talks about direct action.

One further indicia of this is the fact that

10

1985(2), first clause, provides a cause of action for

11

after the fact retaliation or retribution.

12

a cause of action for a juror or a witness who has

13

already testified or already rendered his verdict and is

14

later harassed, intimidated or threatened.

15

indicate that someone with standing such as Respondent

16

here, a party, who is not himself intimidated, would

17

have no complaint after the verdict had been entered or

18

after a witness had already testified.

That would

20

presented to the Court, I would like to reserve the rest

21

of my time for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.

federal issue is res judicata?
MR. GALLAGHER:

4

I don't think, in all candor,

5

MR. GALLAGHER:

Yes, and the state action had

5

The state court witnesses?

Your Honor, let me explain

factually how this occurred, which I think would shed

3

some light on it.

4

the complaint, in the amended complaint, was that the

5

Defendant Kush, subsequent to a football game that

6

occurred up in Seattle, Washington, and after the

7

Defendant had shanked a punt and come off the field, the

8

Defendant Kush punched Kevin Rutledge, on the

sidelines.

20

One of the principle allegations in

This was an allegation in the complaint.
As it turned out, several of the players had

2

witnessed that incident, and when we filed the complaint

22

in the federal court the Defendants did several things

23

to intimidate witnesses.

Well, perhaps my concern can be

potential witnesses, then, not just people who had been

2

given on witness lists immediately prior to trial or who

3

had been witnesses at depositions?

4

MR. HING;

Yes, Mr. Rehnquist, I believe it

5

does, because at the point that the action was filed we

6

immediately noticed depositions.

7

some 20 depositions.

8

individuals who were being deposed or who were being

noticed for depositions that some of this intimidation

was amended in the federal court.

Then the complaint

5

MR. HING:

And included the —

6

QUESTION:

To include this allegation —

7

MR. HING;

— allegation under Section 1985.

8

QUESTION:

And then how did the state cause of

9

action develop, and did the state cause of action

10

include this same allegation?

11

MR. HING:

What happened. Justice O'Connor,

12

was that the federal action was subsequently dismissed

13

in its entirety by the federal district court on the

14

ground that the court had no jurisdiction over any of

15

the parties based on the Eleventh Amendment.

16

appealed that decision, but pending the appeal, because

17

of statute of limitations problems and not wanting to

18

take the risk of having the statute run on us, we of

19

course filed an action in the state court after the

20

federal action was dismissed.

21

QUESTION:

That included this claim.

22

MR. HING:

We did include the 1985 claim.

We

23

However, the trial court in the state court dismissed

24

the 1985 claim on the grounds that the federal court had

25

already dismissed that claim.

And therefore we have

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

never had a day in court on the 1985 claim.

2

So regardless of what happens --

3

QUESTION;

4

And in fact you may never,

notwithstanding what we do, is that right?

5

MR. HING*

Well, Justice O'Connor, my

6

assumption is that we will have a day in court on not

7

only the 1985 claim, hut depending on what happens on

8

the appeal in the state court action we may very well

9
10

have a day in court in the federal court on all of the
«
claims, for the simple reason that the Plaintiff made a

11

decision long ago that he wanted to try this case in the

12

federal court, and for very good reasons, and that is

13

that point the Plaintiff-Respondent would have the

23

choice of determining whether he wants the case retried

24

on the merits in the federal court or the state court.

25

Now, Kevin Rutledge in his amended complaint

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

alleged that the Defendants have conspired to prevent by

2

intimidation and threat various material witnesses from

3

freely, fully and truthfully testifying as to matters

4

raised in the within complaint.

5

1985(2), the first portion, gives the injured party a

6

damage action against those who have conspired to deter

7

by force, intimidation or threat any party or witness

8

from testifying in any matter pending in any federal

9

court.

42 U.S. Code Section

I think the point that counsel made, that

10
11

Kevin Rutledge is not the injured party, certainly is

12

not supported by the statute, because the portion of

13

Section 1985 which creates the private action, which is

14

contained in the latter part of subsection
QUESTION!

15
16

MR. HINGi

Yes.

The complaint is part of the

20

Hr. Hing, do we have the complaint

Well, I have an appendix here that

has nothing, and I mean nothing.
Oh, that.

Well, now I see what it is.

23

MR. HINGi

It is part of the appendix to the

24

Petitioner's brief.

25

QUESTION!

21
22

The

petition?

I see.

Well, I got mislaid by this

1

thing.

2

that.

3

I don't know what this is.

SR. HINCs

Thank you.

I got

But the enabling or the section of

4

the statute which creates the private rights says the

5

party so injured or deprived may have an action for the

6

recovery of damage occasioned by such injury or

7

deprivation against any one or more of the

8

conspirators.

9

an action and who has all of his witnesses intimidated

So I would assume that a party who brings

10

to such an extent that he can't produce his witnesses is

11

in fact the injured party, and I think that it would

12

strain statutory construction to construe otherwise.

13

Furthermore, Section 1985(2), first portion,

14

does not require that the Plaintiff be the subject of

15

racial or class-based invidiously discriminatory

16

animus.

17

first portion of Section 1985(2) prohibits conduct which

18

forms the basis for the claim which is a serious

19

interference with the judicial process itself.

20

the question really is whether Congress gave the federal

21

courts the jurisdiction to hear private damage actions

22

without regard to class-based discriminatory animus

23

where the action is based on interference with the

24

judicial processes of the federal courts themselves.

25

The significant fact in this case is that the

We suggest that Congress clearly did.

So that

First,

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the language of the statute supports this

2

interpretation.

3

this interpretation.

4

compels this interpretation.

5

that Congress had the power to so legislate.

Second, legislative history supports
Third, common sense and logic
There is also no question

Now, a close reading of Section 1985 shows

6
7

that it had basically four parts or four prohibited acts

8

in the first portion of the statute prior to the

9

semicolon.

In the first instance, they prohibited the

10

threatening of parties or witnesses who were about to

11

testify in the federal court.

12

prohibition against doing injury to a party or witness

13

who had already testified in a federal court.

14
15

QUESTION:

The second item was a

But that is a crime, isn’t it?

That's a specific crime — to injure a witness --

16

MR. HING:

Your Honor, that is.

17

QUESTION:

Can you enjoin a crime?

18

MR. HING:

I do not believe so.

But in this

19

case, under this statute the Congress made it a private

20

right of action.

21

was already covered by the criminal statutes does not

22

mean that it cannot also be covered by a civil statute

23

giving the injured party a damage claim, and that is

24

precisely what is done in Section 1985(2).

25

In other words, the argument that this

The third item which the first part of Section

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1985(2) prohibits is that you cannot attempt to

2

influence the verdict of a juror or influence a juror.

3

And the fourth item is that you cannot injure a juror

4

after he has assented to a verdict.
So the first part of Section 1985(2) covers

5

6

all of those four items, the first two having to do with

7

witnesses either before or after testifying and the

8

second two having to do with jurors either before or

9

after participating in a verdict.

10

And then after the semicolon, the two items

11

which are prohibited involve obstructing justice with

12

intent to deny any citizen equal protection of the law.

13

But it says "obstructing justice in any state or

14

territory.

15

Congress is talking about actions in a state or

16

territory, not in the federal court, as it was prior to

17

the semicolon.

18

So as soon as you get past the semicolon

Then the second item which is covered after

19

the semicolon is action to injure a person who is

20

attempting to enforce his right to equal protection, and

21

that also presumably would be in a state.

22

So I think clearly Congress delineated what

23

the limits were or what the conditions vers with respect

24

to the restricted or the proscribed acts before the

25

semicolon and aftar the semicolon.

There is absolutely

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

no equal protection language before the semicolon.

Each

2

one of the proscribed acts relates to protection of the

3

integrity of the judicial process itself.

4

semicolon they don’t talk about federal courts; they now

5

talk about acts in the state, and you have broad,

6

sweeping language with equal protection requirements.

And after the

So the statutory language itself is quite

7

8

clear, even without regard to exploring the legislative

9

intent.

Now, legislative intent in many instances, or

10

rather in most instances, is rather difficult to

11

determine, but I think that there is no ambiguity with

12

respect to legislative intent in this instance.
Congress was concerned about restoration of

13
14

federal courts after the Civil War.

They wanted to

15

protect the functioning of the federal courts.

16

was serious question as to whether state courts were

17

either willing or able to protect the rights of all

18

citizens.

19

clearly that where Congress was legislating with respect

20

to any matter which affected an officer or agency of the

21

Federal Government they saw no necessity to insert equal

22

protection language.

23

conspiracies having no direct impact on either a federal

24

officer or a federal agency. Congress did insert equal

25

protection language.

There

And the debates on the legislation show very

However, in other areas involving

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I think that it certainly is not a great

1
2

extension of jurisdiction to the federal court to give

3

the federal court jurisdiction to entertain a private

4

damage action under the present circumstances, because

5

each one of those four items which occurs in Section

6

1985, subsection (2), first phrase or first clause,

7

involves matters which are within the contempt power of

8

the court.

9

assist the court in protecting the integrity of its own

And apparently Congress felt that it would

10

processes by giving private actions to all parties who

11

might be damaged by such interference with the judicial

12

processes of the federal courts.

13

Finally, I think that clearly we do not

14

require any Fourteenth Amendment mandate or sanction in

15

order to have Congress legislate with respect to the

16

four items occurring in the first part of that

17

subsection.

18

give federal courts whatever powers are necessary to

19

regulate its own functioning is found in Article I,

20

Section 8, of the Constitution.

21

The power to regulate federal courts and to

With respect to the so-called split of

22

districts, or rather Court of Appeals, on this issue, I

23

think that a close reading of the two cases, one in the

24

Fifth Circuit, which is the Kimble case, and the Jones

25

case which was in the Eighth Circuit, would show that

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

actually none of those cases involved a claim which fell

2

within the first portion of Section 1985, subsection

3

(2) .

4

In Kimble, the Plaintiff sued employers for

5

denying him employment because of his prior history of

6

filing lawsuits under workman's compensation claims.

7

Hell, certainly that doesn't fall under any of the four

8

items of the first clause of Section 1985(2).

9

think the court correctly ruled that he didn’t have a

10
11

So I

claim under the first portion.
With respect to the Jones case, that involved

12

a case where a mistrial was declared because the U.S.

13

Attorney had used electronic surveillance equipment to

14

monitor a juror to determine whether the juror was going

15

to be contacted by a party.

16

I don't think falls under any of the first four items of

17

1985(2) either.

18

Row, that particular claim

So a close study of those two cases would

19

indicate that there is nothing inconsistent in the

20

opinions of the Fifth Circuit and Eighth Circuit which

21

is contrary to the position of the Respondent here.

22

QUESTIONS

Hell, the Court — of course, the

23

Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, they thought

24

that they were deciding contrary to the Fifth and the

25

Eighth Circuit.

Your Honor, I believe they were,

but I don’t think an examination of the precise claim

that each plaintiff was advancing —
QUESTION;

4

Well, the Court of Appeals below

5

was wrong in saying that they were in conflict with the

6

Fifth and the Eighth.

7

MR. HING;

Your Honor, I believe they were.

8

QUESTION;

Yes, all right.

9

MR. HING:

And I believe that the First

10

Circuit and the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals

11

of the District of Columbia, of course, were correct in

their decisions.

13

under the first portion of Section 1985(2} in the Fifth

Circuit and Eighth Circuit cases.

But I certainly did not see a claim

With respect to the authority of Griffin v.

15
16

Breckenridge, I don't think that that of course involves

17

or really is relevant to this case at all, because

18

Griffin v. Breckenridge was based on a 1985 subsection

19

(3) claim, which very clearly contains equal protection

language.

21

Breckenridge based its decision not on the Fourteenth

22

Amendment but on the Thirteenth Amendment and on the

23

right to interstate travel.

24

is on point.

25

Furthermore, the Court in Griffin v.

So I don’t think that case

We certainly don't think that there's any

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

danger here of creating a federal tort law, because

2

under the circumstances of the case a party would

3

already have to be in the federal court on another

4

matter in order for him to allege that his witnesses

5

were being intimidated.

6

Rutledge would have to have another claim under federal

7

jurisdiction in order to have a 1985 subsection (2)

claim .

9

QUESTIONS

So really, Plaintiff Kevin

You would agree, then, that if a

10

complaint were not yet filed in federal court there

11

could be no claim that potential witnesses in a later to

be filed lawsuit were intimidated?

13

MR. HINGs

Mr. Justice Rehnguist, that could

14

be possible if the plaintiff were so sure that witnesses

15

were already being intimidated and he had every

16

intention of filing that lawsuit in the federal court.

MR. HING«

Congress sought to avoid here the harm to the

9

MR. HINGs

And if you have no

Well, under those conditions.

10

Justice Rehnquist, I would agree.

11

you had circumstances under which ,the public passion and

12

prejudice against the particular party was so strong

13

that he was certain that he wanted to proceed in the

14

federal court, then I think it would be a different

circumstance.

16

any respect, because we had a complaint filed at the

17

time the amended complaint was made setting forth this

18

1985(2) claim.

19

But if, for example,

But that would not apply to this case in

It was also the position of the

20

Plaintiff-Respondent below that he as a matter of fact

21

was a member of a class, and the class of which he was a

22

member was a group of players who did not meet the

23

standards of the Defendant Kush.

25

sense, and that is that beginning in 1978 --

QUESTION;

If you have an assault case, can’t

2

you say in almost any assault case that the person

3

assaulted was a member of a class who didn't meet the

4

standards of the person who assaulted them?

5

MR. HING;

Mr. Justice Rehnguist, that — in

6

that context I would agree with you.

But the facts in

7

this case were different and I think that you have to

8

recognize that in 1978 Arizona State University suddenly

9

shifted from the Western Athletic Conference, where they

10

were competing with teams like Wyoming and New Mexico

11

and Texas El Paso, to the PAC 10, where they were

12

competing with teams like USC, UCLA, Stanford,

13

Washington, et cetera.

14

At the same time, under NCAA regulations each

15

coach could give out 30 scholarships per year to

16

athletes, but no more than 95 scholarships total.

17

this created a situation where you had to get rid of

18

some players.

19

year, you could not have 30 players stay on the team

20

from which you had given 30 scholarships in the three

21

prior years.

22

So

In order to give out 30 scholarships this

You’d have 120 and the maximum is 95.

Now, that particular restriction has been

responsible more than anything else to the recent

teams in the nation.
