You may proceed, Mr. Latcham.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. LATCHAM:

May it please the Court, this is an

appeal from the California Court of Appeals, the California

and Woolworth cases.

However,

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. LATCHAM:

In the formula, that is right.

The

MR. LATCHAM:

11

Here, as contrasted with ASARCO and Woolworth, there

Yes.

12

is immediate state taxation of the foreign subsidiaries' income

13

even though it is not distributed to the parent.

14

In regard to the unitary issue, Container — I want to

15

say one more thing about the order of our arguments.

16

position is that it may prevail on any one of the following

17

arguments:

18

is not unitary with its foreign subsidiaries; second, under the

19

due process clause because California is taxing extraterritorial

20

income due to distortion in the formula; third, under the commerce

21

clause because of double taxation; and, fourth, under the commerce

22

clause because the California system prevents the United States

23

from speaking with one voice in the field of foreign relations.

24
25

Container's

First, under the due process clause because Container

is the same whether these are foreign or domestic subsidiaries?
MR. LATCHAM:

That is correct, Your Honor.

And, also,

I think we would be making — The due process distortion argument
is the same.
In regard to the unitary argument, Container and its
foreign subsidiaries are a separate business operation.
Now, I would say in regard to reviewing the facts,

14

Container has no quarrel in general with the Court of Appeals'

15

statement of fact except in a few instances noted in our main

16

brief in which we believe the Court of Appeals made errors in

17

its statement, but we believe we would prevail on the statement

18

of facts in the Court of Appeals case.

19

with their legal conclusion.

20

We, of course, disagree

In any event, we would invite the Court to read the

21

record, which is rather short, comprising a stipulation of facts

22

and uncontroverted testimony.

Such a test would arise from the

one that was suggested by this court in the majority opinion in

was suggested.

of the majority opinion in which the court talked about a flow

of international commerce and they did talk about a flow of

They were,

Container's only involvement was the approval of major

13

capital appropriations which originated from the subsidiaries.

14

Of course, as in ASARCO and Woolworth, there were discussions

15

back and forth between Container and the subsidiaries, but the

16

subsidiaries management were in control and held responsible for

17

the operations.

QUESTION:

19

MR. LATCHAM:

But, I suppose the parent elected the boards.
Well, as a matter of fact, the record

shows that the parent had less than a majority of the directors

on the overall.

He also

I was

13

about to say that, of course, in the case of the Colombian and

14

Venezuelan subsidiaries the public shareholders would have the

15

right to elect directors and the stipulation of facts also states

16

that for the most part the Container personnel who were directors

17

were not directly involved in the operation of the subsidiaries.

18

As I said, of course, there were discussions back and

19

forth between the parent and subsidiaries much like those in

20

the Woolworth case.

21

management was overseeing its investment in the subsidiaries.

22

Certainly there was no economy of scale arising from centralized

23

management in this case.

in spite of the fact that the Franchise Tax Board claiming that

Container's income.

Of course, the effect is to shift substantial

income from the subsidiaries, particularly in Venezuela and
Colombia, to Container, and, therefore, to California.

which are the most profitable subsidiaries, were lower and the

profitability much higher.

11

the Venezuelan and Colombian subsidiaries is apportioned to

Container and, therefore, partly to California.

13

subsidiaries earned about $4 million a year.

14

$2 million, by formulary apportionment, is apportioned to

is shifted to Container.

We, of course, are using separate accounting as a

Furthermore, we are not using separate accounting in

4

We were required to use separate accounting, or at least the

is the custom of nations to use separate accounting as I will

mention in a moment.

12
13

QUESTION:

Venezuela and Colombia didn't require you

to use separate accounting in California, did they?
MR. LATCHAM:

They did not, Your Honor.

They did not.

They certainly required it, however, in Venezuela and Colombia.
We also maintain that California's worldwide method

14

violates the commerce clause because it leads to double taxation,

15

both inherently and in this case.

16

double taxation here.

17

method, is taxing income in part which foreign countries,

18

through separate accounting, has taxed in full.

property, Container, in full in Japan and California, by an

21

apportionment method, was taxing them in part.

MR. LATCHAM:

No, they do not, Your Honor.

They do

2

not allow a credit or any deduction for taxes paid in foreign

3

countries.

4

So, as far as they are concerned, it is irrelevant.
As I said, the subsidiaries filed returns in these

5

countries on a separate accounting basis and paid the tax thereon.

6

The Board took separate accounting income, book separate

accounting income, which is very close to taxable separate

Is that also included in Container's income?
MR. LATCHAM:

That is not included in Container's

income insofar as California is concerned, because the commerical

17

domocile is in Chicago.

18

I might mention, however, that California has a special

19

statute which states that to the extent dividends are paid to a

20

company with a commerical domocile outside of California the

QUESTION:

Mr. Latcham, in our proposed treaty with

14

the United Kingdom, the Senate, of course, removed the language

15

that would have denied the states the right to apply this

16

formulary apportionment which certainly is at least an indicator

17

that the federal government isn' t interested in speaking with one

18

voice in this area.

19

MR. LATCHAM:

Well, I would say in regard to the treaty,

20

Your Honor, there was — A majority of the Senate voted in favor

21

of the treaty retaining that provision,

22

did not.

Right.
And, in the legislative history to that

treaty, there is considerable indication that many senators were

19

concerned that this problem should not be taken up by Congress

2

through the treaty mechanism, but it should go to both houses

3

of Congress.

5

So, I think it is an inconclusive determination as to

the Court:
Here, Container concedes, apparently for the purposes

14

of domestic taxation, taxation of interstate commerce that is,

15

and also it concedes for the purpose of taxing its own activities

16

in Canada, that the formula apportionment method is proper.

However, it seeks preferential treatment, a special rule, for

11

facts which we feel are shown to clearly exist under this Court's

12

most recent Woolworth statement of the rule and the test and

13

the Butler Brothers case which clearly applies the unitary

formula in a situation similar to this and we feel that the facts,

which Your Honor has heard properly by an advocate this afternoon will

17

clearly establish that we have a clear unitary business here.

Thirdly, we will talk about unitary business

First, with respect to the commerce clause argument,

these are predicated upon this Court's 1979 Japan Line argument

Well, on that basis, the whole unitary

concept is meaningless anyway.

these situations, you could do your work through divisions.

7

MR. GOBAR:

In any situation — In any of

My point, Your Honor, is that the unitary

8

formula method should be applicable as California has uniformly

9

applied it regardless of the activities — whether the unit —

10

you have to have a unitary business, but regardless of whether

11

the unit is operated through a single corporation or through a

12

parent in a number of subsidiaries, the treatment has to be the

13

same if they are both unitary businesses to avoid the ability,

14

which the major companies here are trying to retain in this

15

case, to shift their income by switching from a division situation

16

subject to formula apportionment while it is a loss, and as Your

17

Honor pointed out, when they start they are losses, and you run

18

your loss divisions in and that reduces your California tax.

19

Italy was a loss during this period.

Some of the other

20

foreign subsidiaries which they have here, they were allocated,

21

even taking the CCA's figures, which we feel are wrong, but

22

even accepting their figures, some of the income was increased,

would have been increased under the formula method.

His submission in the Chicago Bridge case.

— in Chicago Bridge?

MR. LATCHAM:

That is right, Your Honor, which certainly

represents the position of the United States on this question of
worldwide unitary apportionment.

And, it is perfectly clear.

He says in his brief, "if, as we submit, the court concludes
