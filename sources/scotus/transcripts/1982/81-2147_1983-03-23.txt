ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN

11

MR. KYL:

81-2147

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

12

may it please the Court, during the floor debate on the

13

McCarren Amendment, Senator McCarren stated to Senator

14

Ernest McFarland, "Let me say to the Senator from

15

Arizona that there is no state in the Union more

16

interested in this bill than is the State of Arizona.

17

In fact, all of the western arid and semi-arid states

18

are interested in this bill."

19

Of course, the reason Senator McCarren

20

believed that the State of Arizona was interested in his

21

bill is because as its sponsor he understood that the

22

State of Arizona could utilize his bill for the

23

adjudication of water rights, and yet we are before this

24

Court 30 years later arguing about whether the McCarren

25

Amendment applies to the courts of Arizona as well as

the other western states
These consolidated cases come to this Court on

3

writs of certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, five cases

4

from Arizona and seven cases from Montana.

5

state general water adjudications had been filed on the

6

five major river systems in the state.

7

after service of process on some 12,000 defendants on

8

the Salt River adjudication, five Arizona tribes filed

9

separate actions for removal petitions in federal court,

In Arizona,

Within a month

10

all on the same day, to enjoin any determination of

11

their rights.

12

These were not suits to adjudicate water

13

rights, but rather suits to prevent any adjudication of

14

their rights.

15

Six weeks later, two other tribes and one in

16

the first group filed separate federal suits to

17

determine their rights only.

18

actions in Arizona have sought a general adjudication of

19

water rights.

20

22

QUESTION;

None of the federal tribal

Could one seek that in a federal

court in Arizona?
MR. KYL;

One could seek that in a federal

23

court in any state, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

None of the

24

tribes, and the United States has not, none of the

25

tribes have sought such an adjudication in the federal

that.

QUESTION;

Well, what would be the basis of

federal jurisdiction?
MR. KYL;

This Court held in the Colorado

6

River case that either under Section 1345 or — well,

7

Section 1345 in that case, that a suit could be filed in

8

the federal court for adjudication of water rights.

9

10
11

QUESTION:

For a statewide or streamwide

adjudication?
MR. KYL:

For a streamwide adjudication, yes.

12

And of course the Court in Colorado River held that the

13

considerations of wise judicial administration that

14

would be applied by the Court would determine whether

15

the adjudication could go forward in the federal court

16

or in the state court if there were concurrent

17

proceedings and concurrent jurisdiction.

18

The key difference between that case and this

19

case is that there there were general adjudications

20

filed in federal court.

21

Here, there are none.

In the state adjudication proceedings that

22

were in the meantime proceeding in Arizona on just the

23

river systems which are before this Court, over 100,000

24

potential defendants were identified.

the Montana cases.
A divided three-judge Ninth Circuit Court

2
3

reversed the Montana and Arizona cases, holding that the

4

enabling Act and constitutional disclaimers of Arizona

5

and Montana constituted a bar from those states

6

adjudicating water rights held in trust for the tribes

7

by the United States unless the states had accepted

8

Public Law 280 jurisdiction.
Most, if not all, of the parties here agree

9
10

that Public Law 280 jurisdiction is irrelevant to these

11

cases.

12

The Ninth Circuit also reversed the Montana

13

case on the ground that the district judges there had

14

improperly considered or applied the considerations of

15

wise judicial administration.

16

in the Arizona cases because of the disposition on the

17

disclaimer issue.

There was no such finding

The United States agrees that the application

of the McCarren Amendment is not barred by the

disclaimers of Arizona, Montana, and the other western

states.

proceedings in Arizona and Montana.

3

I will discuss the application of those

4

considerations in the Arizona litigation, which we

5

submit presents a much stronger case for state court

6

adjudication than did the facts of Colorado River.

7

co-counsel, General Greely, will address those

8

considerations as to the Montana litigation.

9

My

The disclaimer provisions do not create

10

different law for those eleven states admitted after

11

1889 than for the states admitted before then.

12

the disclaimers were a response to U.S. versus

13

McBratney, merely intended to confirm the plenary power

14

of the United States government as to Indian tribes.

15

There was not in 188S and there is not today any reason

16

to differentiate between the states.

17

distinction would be purely artificial.

18

Rather,

Any such

Congress has made no such distinction in

19

passing laws applicable to all of the states, nor has

20

this Court in interpreting the applicability of laws to

21

-- state laws to Indian reservations, and creation of

22

such a distinction today would not only put into

23

question those Acts of Congress, but also the decisions

24

of this Court.

25

too late in 1983 to create a distinction where none has

3

the disclaimer as a bar is illustrated by your decision

in Organized Village of Kake versus Egan.

5

Justice Frankfurter, for a unanimous court, stated that

6

even though Indian lands in Arizona remained under the

7

absolute jurisdiction and control of the United States,

8

in other words, subject to the disclaimer, the Court had

9

declared in the Arizona case of Williams versus Lee that

There, Mr.

10

the test whether a state law could be applied on an

11

Indian reservation was whether absent governing Acts of

12

Congress, the application of that law would interfere

13

with reservation self-government.

14

Congress has exercised its absolute

15

jurisdiction and control recognized by the disclaimers

16

by enacting the McCarren Amendment.

19

trust for the tribes, to be determined in comprehensive

state court general adjudications.

21

That is the

It prevents all water

In other words, the disclaimer merely

22

acknowledges the right of the United States to pass a

23

law like the McCarren Amendment.

24

as the tribes argue,

Kake, the disclaimer is not inconsistent.

The right, or

2

the disclaimer, rather, of all right and title was

3

merely a disclaimer of proprietary interest, not

4

governmental interest, and the acknowledgement in the

5

disclaimers of absolute federal jurisdiction and control

6

remains undiminished, not exclusive federal jurisdiction.
This Court's clear and meaningful decision in

7

8

Colorado River would be trivialized if the Court were

9

now to limit the application of the McCarren Amendment

10

to only four western states.
The real question in this case, we submit, is

11

12

the application of the consideration of wise judicial

13

administration to these cases.

14

deferred to the state court proceedings after

15

considering those factors.

16

here.

In Colorado River you

A fortiori, you should do so

In Colorado River, the most important factor

17
18

you found was the HcCarren Amendment itself, and you

19

held that the McCarren Amendment evinced two clear

20

federal policies:

21

piecemeal adjudication of water rights, and Number Two,

22

the recognition of the availability of, and later in the

23

Moses Cohn case you said the peculiar appropriateness,

24

of comprehensive state systems for adjudication of water

25

rights.

Number One, the avoidance of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-8300

1

You discussed those two first,, the avoidance

2

of piecemeal adjudication is a critical factor here.

3

Unlike the facts of the Colorado River case, there are

4

no general adjudications pending in the Arizona federal

5

district court.

6

Judge Merrill, pointed out that in these cases there

7

would not only be no piecemeal adjudication, there would

8

be no adjudication of water rights at all in the federal

9

district courts.

10

The Ninth Circuit judge who dissented,

The only adjudication of water rights that can

11

occur in Arizona, the only comprehensive adjudication,

12

is in the state comprehensive adjudication process.

13

The second of those two clear federal policies

14

was the recognition of the availability of state courts,

15

comprehensive state proceedings, and the significant

16

administrative assistance given to the state courts

17

through those comprehensive state statutes.

18

Just one month ago today, in the Moses H. Cohn

19

case, Mr. Justice Brennan for the Court said, "There is

20

an affirmative policy in federal law expressly approving

21

litigation of federal water rights in the state court,

22

the McCarren Amendment,” and of course that is precisely

23

what the Colorado River case --

QUESTION;

Mr. Kyi, I take it that the Ninth

Circuit didn't reach this question with respect to

12

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

comprehensive or whether it isn’t?

And isn’t that — isn’t that sort

6

8

That is correct, Mr. Justice White.

No, Mr. Justice White.

This Court

It does go to interpreting state

law.
MR. KYL<

Yes, it does, but there has been, I

14

believe, in this case no question about the

15

comprehensiveness of the Arizona state proceedings, the

16

ability of those statutes to comprehensively and

17

properly —

18

QUESTION;

Well, but suppose we agree with you

19

on the enabling Act and on the Constitution.

agreed with you that the Court of Appeals was quite

wrong in disposing of the case on that ground, the

federal district judge, Judge Cordoga, did precisely

2

that.

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the Court of

Appeals didn’t reach it.
MR. KYL:

5

Well, that’s correct, and we would

6

certainly submit that the judge in the very best

7

position to weigh these factors would be the federal

8

district judge who is on the spot, who made the

9

decision .
QUESTION:

10

Well, I Know, but you wouldn’t

11

suggest that we would reverse the Court of Appeals

12

necessarily if the Court of Appeals overturned the

13

district judge on what may be very much a question of

14

state law.

15

MR. KYL:

Well, Mr. Justice White, let me

16

answer that question two ways.

17

reiterate, I do not believe that there is a serious

18

contention in this case --

MR. KYL;

in any respect.

Secondly, we believe that this case

2

more to policy considerations in man y respects than they

3

do testimonial facts, and this Court clearly can weigh

4

the same kind of factors that it did in the Colorado

5

River decision here, based upon the record before the

6

Court.

7

The f actors go really

The Arizona proceedings, a s I said, are

8

comprehensive, they are modern, fair , and efficient, and

9

as I indicated, there is nothing com parable for the

10
11

federal courts in Arizona.
Another important factor i n Colorado River was

12

how much progress had occurred.

13

discussion of the race to the courth ouse.

14

the Arizona actions were filed first .

15

the important thing.

16

the federal courts, no progress had occurred, because

17

before any answers were filed, the d istrict judge either

18

dismissed or stayed or remanded all of the tribal

19

actions, so nothing had occurred.

20

The re was some

What progress had occurred?

MR. KYL;

Mr. Justice Stevens, the Indians, or

3

the United States on behalf of the Indians, have

4

repeatedly sought extensions of time for the filing of

5

their claims in these proceedings.

6
7

QUESTION;

Well,

they want to proceed in the

federal court.

8

MR. KYLi

9

QUESTION*

Yes.
But to what extent have their

10

rights so far been adjudicated at all in the state

11

proceedings?

12
13
14

SR. KYL;

No Indian rights have been

adjudicated in the state court proceedings.
QUESTION:

And they rely on an entirely

15

different legal theory, as I understand it, than the one

16

normally applied in state proceedings.

17

MR. KYI:

The Indians rely upon the reserved

18

right doctrine, and that doctrine is a doctrine of

19

federal law applicable in the state courts as well as

20

the federal courts.

21

QUESTION;

So aren't both sets of cases right

22

at the starting point insofar as the Indian cases are

23

concerned, Indian claims are concerned?

suggest not.

state court is a complex determination

It starts with

2

the investigation of the river system itself by the

3

Department of Water Resources, the physical on-site

4

investigation, to determine how much water is available.
It is important to recognize that in the

5

6

suggestion of the United States, for example, there is

7

the idea that somehow this is a very simple proposition

8

with respect to Indian reserved rights.

9

simple proposition at all, if done correctly, because

It is not a

MR. KYL:

1

No.

Mr. Justice Brennan, in the

2

consolidated cases and the Little Colorado proceeding

3

that are before this Court -- there are some other cases

4

that are pending, but not before the Court.

Well, I was thinking of the state

MR. KYL:

QUESTION:

9

MR. KYL:

Yes, there are -How many parties are there?
There have been over 70,000

10

defendants personally served.

11

QUESTION:

Now, I gather the issues involved

12

in those cases are quite different than in the Indian

13

cases .

14

MR. KYL:

Mr. Justice Brennan, no, there is

15

only one issue in any of these cases, and that is the

16

inter sese determination of rights:

17

water right at what point in time, and how does it

18

relate to all of the other holders of water rights?

19

that issue is best determined, as this Court held in

20

Colorado, in a unitary proceeding in which all of the

21

parties are before the Court, can present any testimony

22

and evidence that is required in order to fit it all

2

Indian reserve water rights on the Tongue River.
In April of '75, the United States, at the

3
4

request of the Crow Tribe, named several hundred

5

defendants on the Big Horn River.

6

suits were all filed in 1979, and they involved the

7

Flathead River and the northern tributaries to the

Missouri River but not the Missouri River itself, and

9

these suits were also filed at the behest of the tribes.

There has been virtually no progress in any of

The four remaining

11

these federal cases, and all seven of these cases were

dismissed by the Federal District Court in Montana in

Now, this is in sharp contrast to the

14

situation in Montana’s state courts.

16

adjudication has been moving very rapidly.

pursuant to state law, a statewide adjudication began

That is correct.

The United

200,000 claims to water rights in the states had been

have abandoned their claims.

By April 30th of 1982, over

Thirty-five thousand of those claims, of the

7

QUESTIONi

8

MR. GREELY:

9

Goes into Columbia.
Unlike Montana, the state

adjudication has not been stayed pending this — pending

10

this proceeding, and the Montana water courts of course

11

have relied on the McCarren Amendment and the Colorado

12

River decision to proceed with their adjudication.

13
14
15

QUESTION;

Was there any effort made, Mr.

Attorney General, to have state proceedings stayed?
MR. GREELY:

There was an effort, I believe,

16

on behalf of one of the tribes to stay the proceedings.

17

That motion was — I believe it was in federal court in

18

Missoula, and I think it was agreed that the federal

19

district judge would not stay -- try to stay the state

20

proceedings pending the decision of this case.

21

Now, in preparation for my oral argument

22

today, I decided to listen to the tape of the oral

23

argument in the Colorado River decision, and I found it

24

to be guite interesting, because I had kind of thought

25

that there wasn't that much discussion of Indian

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

rights.

I thought the discussion in that case before

2

the Court in oral argument concentrated on keeping the

3

federal reserved rights in federal court.
But much to my surprise, over 50 percent of

4
5

the argument that was presented by the Solicitor’s

6

Office, Mr. Shapiro, involved Indian water rights, and

7

many of the questions that this Court raised involved

8

Indian rights.

9

argument was whether Indian rights,

10

The question that appeared in oral
reserved water

rights should be adjudicated in state court.
And the arguments in that case echo very much

11

12

the briefs of the Indian tribes and the United States in

13

this case.

14

from the Colorado River case, and obviously I am not

15

going to read it to you or read great detail from it,

16

but it is -- just to give you an idea, with

17

indulgence, let me just read a couple of the headings

18

here.

It is interesting, and I have the brief here

the

"Determination of Indian and federal water

19

20

claims in federal court will not interfere with state

21

proceedings.

22

water rights suits by the United States in federal

23

courts.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1
2

Indian water rights."
Now, the only reason -- the only difference I

3

see between that language and the language in the

4

Solicitor’s brief today is that they used the terra

5

"integrate!" in that brief, that the rights would be

6

integrated in the state proceedings, and the terminology

7

that has been used here is "plugging in."

8

9

Now, this Court rejected all those arguments
in the Colorado River decision, and we are dealing with

10

the same statute, the JfcCarren Amendment, and this Court

11

has interpreted that in Colorado River, and seven years

12

after the decision in 1976 in Colorado River, Congress

13

has not seen fit to amend that provision.

14

I think, it might also be important, if I may,

15

to examine the proposal of the Solicitor in this case,

16

the proposal that the Indian rights somehow can be

17

adjudicated separately in a federal court proceeding

18

while all the other rights are adjudicated in a state

19

court proceeding.

20

argument that was made in Colorado Fiver, and this Court

21

has held, as Mr. Kyi referred to in the Cohn case, that

22

clear federal policy of avoiding piecemeal adjudications

23

of water rights in the river system are concerned, and

24

there is a preference for a unitary and comprehensive

25

proceeding in the state court.

This, of course, was the same

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 626-9300

1

And there is good reason, and let me suggest

2

the nightmare that may occur in Montana should we have

3

any kind of a concurrent proceeding in that state

4

ongoing in the same river drainages as the comprehensive

5

proceeding for state water rights.

6

And the government says in its brief that the

7

-- the government says in its brief that it, if course,

8

if this Court would hold that Indian rights could be

9

done in federal court, it will go back and amend its

10

complaint, and of course it would have to amend its

11

complaint to put that plug-in plan into effect.

12

tinder the federal rules, of course, they would

13

have to file a motion to amend, and in the federal cases

14

there are approximately 9,000 defendants, and they would

15

have to be served, and some of those defendants may

16

oppose the motion, some of them may consent to it, and

17

some of them might not even respond, and then there

18

would be hearings on those motions, and if the motion

19

were granted, then the new complaints would have to be

20

filed, and those would have to be served, and really the

21

question is, who would be the defendants in those

22

federal case proceedings when they ara supposedly just

23

adjudicating Indian rights?

24
25

Well, the answer is, in a comprehensive water
adjudication everybody would have to be a defendant,

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

whether they had a state right, a federal right, a

2

federal reserved right, or an Indian water right, if —

3

that is, if that decree were to be binding on all the

4

parties.
And the purpose for all of this, the

5

6

government suggests, is that the federal courts are the

7

judicial forum or the preferred forum for determining

8

Indian water rights, and Colorado River clearly answered

9

this argument by saying that the Indian rights can be

10

adjudicated in state court just as easily and maybe more

11

easily than in federal court.
Now, there is one other issue that may

12

13

possibly trouble the Court, and this issue I don't

14

believe was discussed or brought up in the Colorado

15

River decision, and this is the issue that apparently

16

gave some trouble to the Ninth Circuit, and that was the

17

issue of whether or not there was a conflict of interest

18

between the tribes and the United States which

19

apparently occurred for the first time at the Ninth

20

Circuit level.
I don't know that the issue was addressed.

21

22

wasn't addressed by the federal district judges of

23

Montana when they dismissed in favor of the state

24

proceedings on the grounds of Colorado River and

25

McCarren.

And of course as I understand, the

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

It

1

government's position is that they don't recognize any

2

conflict of interest in this case or in any of these

3

cases, to my knowledge, that are consolidated here on

4

appeal.

5

Apparently, the argument, and this is the

6

argument that is made by the tribes, is that the U.S.

7

should not be representing the tribes with regard to

8

their reserved Indian water rights because the U.S.

9

have some federal reserve water rights that may be in

10

conflict with the tribes' rights if they occur in the

11

same adjudication process.

12

Of course, that was the exact situation that

13

existed in the Colorado case.

14

What about the Blackfeet?

Are they

But the Blackfeet, unlike the other respondent Montana

which is an absolute jurisdictional bar in our opinion,

over the tribes and their property, matters which are at

2

the very core of the protective relationship between the

3

United States and the Indian tribes, and from which the

4

tribes and their elected officials historically have

5

been excluded.

6

The states are claiming this power by virtue

7

of a statute, the MCcarren Amendment, that does no more

8

on its face than simply waive the sovereign immunity of

9

the United States in water adjudication suits.

It does

10

not mention Indians, Indian tribes, Indian water rights,

11

or Indian reservations, nor is there any evidence in the

12

legislative history of this statute of Congressional

13

concern about such critical matters as tribal sovereign

14

immunity, the federal government's conflict of interest,

15

the state court's traditional hostility to Indians, or

16

the disclaimers of jurisdiction in the enabling Acts and

17

constitutions of the eleven western states.

18

The petitioners, we submit, are asking this

19

Court to do the work of the Congress by filling in all

20

of these legislative gaps, but the McCarren Amendment is

21

far too slim a reed to carry this immense weight.

22

cannot sweep everything else aside, especially when

23

effect can be given to its principal purpose as well as

24

other relevant laws, treaties, and national policies, by

25

limiting McCarren's waiver of sovereign immunity to the

extended, but the Colorado River case expressly rejected

the argument that the McCarren Amendment divests federal

courts of their jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian water

rights.

19

tfhile the anti-piecemealing policy that the

20

Court perceived in the McCarren Amendment was held

21

sufficient to justify deference to an ongoing state

22

adjudication in certain very specific and limited

circumstances, we submit that much more than that is

First, let me speak specifically about the

jurisdiction of the United States.

11

was repeated in the disclaimer provisions in the 1889

Act admitting Montana and three other states.

repeated again in the 1910 Act admitting Arizona and New

14

Mexico, and on six or seven other occasions, as recently

as 1958.

It was

The position of the tribes is that these

17

enabling Acts have not been changed or repealed, that

18

they remain in effect, and that they absolutely bar

19

state court jurisdiction over Indian rights.

20

Now, there is little doubt about what the

21

McCarren -- about what the disclaimers mean, excuse me.

22

They mean what they say.

disclaimers.

16

disclaimers are duly enacted laws of the United States.

They must be given effect unless they are found to be

unconstitutional or impliedly repealed, and the

government does not even attempt to show that the

20

standards for finding an implied repeal have been met.

21

The obvious response is that the

Congress obviously was aware that states

22

admitted after 1889 were made subject to different laws

23

than previously admitted states, and Congress has

24

frequently applied different rules to Indians in

different states.

QUESTION?

How about the equal footing clause?

3

MR. PELCYGERi

The equal footing doctrine only

4

prohibits the United States from asserting unique

5

conditions on statehood that Congress would not

6

otherwise have authority to impose, and since Congress

7

has plenary and full authority to impose virtually any

8

condition and any exercise, any authority over Indians,

9

the equal footing doctrine is not a concern in this

10
11

case .
QUESTION:

Hell, in Pollard against Hagen, the

12

objection was not that Congress didn't have authority in

13

the abstract to reserve water out of its own territory

that was making a state, but that it hadn't done it with

15

the other states.

QUESTION:

In Pollard against Hagen, which I

think is the leaving equal footing case.
MR. PELCYGERi

Hell, there is no question, and

21

Arizona against California specifically held that

22

Congress has full authority to reserve water for Indian

23

reservations pre-statehood and post-statehood, and there

24

is a full range of court decisions which hold -- Winters

25

against the United States is probably the leading case

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

holding that the equal footing doctine does not prohibit

2

any federal legislation dealing with Indian affairs or

3

any reservation of rights for Indians.
QUESTION;

4
5

No, but that was not addressed to

this kind of a disclaimer.
MR. PELCYGER;

6

Well, the disclaimers have been

7

given effect by this Court, the Indian disclaimers have

8

been given effect by this Court time and time again, in

9

Williams against Lee, in Fisher against the District

10

Court, in McClannahan in 1973, and the equal footing

11

doctrine under the cases cited in our brief at Pages 46

12

to 47 is just not a factor in dealing with Indian

13

affairs, for the reasons that are explained in those

14

cases.

15

Now, if the government believes that

16

disclaimer and non-disclaimer states should be treated

17

exactly alike, it is addressing its argument to the

18

wrong institution.

19

and it is for Congress, not this Court, to do away with

20

it, and indeed, only a year after McCarren was enacted,

21

when the disclaimers were specifically brought to the

22

attention of the Congress, Congress did exactly that.

23

It repealed the disclaimers in Public Law 280 in order

24

to permit disclaimer state courts to assume limited

25

civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian disputes but

Congress created that distinction,

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

of course specifically excluded the adjudication of

2

Indian water rights.
So, what both the petitioners and the

3
4

government's position have in common that they are

5

asking this Court to do what Congress has never done,

6

repeal the disclaimers in order to permit state court

7

adjudications of Indian water rights.
Since effect, though, can and therefore must

8
9

be given to both statutes, we submit that the federal

10

courts should retain jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian

11

water rights.

12

Now, turning to the conflict of interest --

13

QUESTION!

14

Are you going to discuss Organized

Village of Kake in your oral argument?
MR. PELCYGERt

15

I wasn't planning to, but I'll

16

be glad to.

Organized Village of Kake against Egan, I

17

think, was fully distinguished from our situation by

18

this Court’s opinion in McClannahan which pointed out

19

that Kake against Egan does not provide any rules or

20

guidelines for determining the relative contours of

21

state jurisdiction when Indian reservations are

22

involved.

23

there were no Indian reservations involved there, and

24

that's what the Court said in McClannahan in dealing

25

with Kake against Egan.

That was an off-reservation case that was —

Now, in Colorado River, the Court — I am

1

2

dealing now with the conflict of interest issue -- the

3

Court expressly did not decide "whether dismissal of the

4

federal suit would be warranted if the state proceeding

5

were in some respect inadequate to resolve the Indian

6

claims. "
Recently, in Moses H. Cohn Memorial Hospital

7

8

case, this Court elaborated on the overriding importance

9

of this inadequacy criterion in cases of this kind. The

10

Court stated, "When a district court decides to dismiss

11

or stay under Colorado River, it presumably concludes

12

that the parallel state court litigation will be an

13

adequate vehicle for the complete and prompt resolution

14

of the issue between the parties.

15

substantial doubt as to this, it would be a serious

16

abuse of discretion to grant the stay or to dismiss at

17

all."

If there is any

I do not assume they cannot.

It would be a question of whether the state courts

I submit the Ninth Circuit considered that question and

5

said that it would be unfair to put the tribes to that

6

Hobson's choice.
I point out that Congress had this question

before it on two occasions.

When the McCarren Amendment

was enacted, Congress did not waive the tribes'

attribute of sovereignty that was reaffirmed in Santa

9

Clara Pueblo against Martinez --

10

11
12

QUESTION;

So they may not be sued without

their consent?
MR. PELCYGER;

That’s correct, and Congress in

13

1956, when it enacted 28 USC Section 1362, which my

14

colleagues will be talking more about, specifically

15

recognized the existence of this conflict problem,

16

recognized that there were instances when the Attorney

17

General would not be able to represent the tribes'

18

interest owing to the conflict, and provided a federal

19

forum, consciously did not provide a state forum for

20

tribes to sue under those circumstances and to represent

21

its own interests.

22

So, I think under those circumstances the

23

Ninth Circuit was quite right not to require the tribes

24

to intervene in the state courts.

25

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIMON H. RIFKIND, ESQ.,

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT ARIZONA INDIAN TRI3ES

23

MR. RIFKIND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

24

please the Court, my argument will be addressed to the

25

considerations which necessarily must underlie the

53

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

argument of this case as I see it, and that is a

2

discussion of the factors addressed to our attention in

3

the Akin case, the case that we have all decided to call

4

Akin, Colorado River against — but

5

open with this one sentence.

I should like to

One of the problems of a consolidated

6
7

proceeding of this kind is that it homogenizes 12

8

different district cases, and the facts do not always

9

fit a single pattern.

I should therefore like to deal

10

in the course of my argument with the f acts as they are

11

set forth in the Navajo case, and only in the Navajo

12

case, because I think that gives you a simple structure

13

and a simple situation.
Now, if the Akin case leaves room for any

14
15

Indian water claim, I say if, then this is the case, and

16

that I shall try to demonstrate in the course of my

17

argument.

18

distinguished friends from Arizona and Montana, I got

19

the impression that they never will find a case under

20

Akin which will enable an Indian claim to remain in the

21

federal court, but if that is so, then the statements in

22

Akin which proclaim again and again that it is the

23

exception and not the rule that seems to be turned

24

upside-down, then we have the rule of abstention set

25

forth in Akin become the universal rule, and then there

therefore, to the extent that occasionally I overlap the

7

isn't because I want to assert the disclaimer argument.

8

I simply want to narrate that as part of the history of

9

this controversy.
The Savajo nation, whom I represent, and by

10
11

reason of the consolidation to some extent I speak for

12

the other Indian tribes, are united in their perception

13

that the choice of forum, which is the problem before

us, in these cases is critical to their prosperity in

future.

2

arrangements with the Navajos, and in order to keep its

3

promise to the Indians, and to put the matter beyond

4

dispute, the United States Congress in 1910, before

5

admitting the State of Arizona to the Union, exacted a

6

promise from the people of that state that they would

7

forever disclaim, and so forth, as you have heard from

8

my friend, Mr. Pelcyger.

9

They understood that that was their treaty

The most recent step taken by the Congress

10

consistent with this United States promise to the

11

Indians, was the enactment in 1966 of Section 1362 of

12

Article 28 to the Code conferring direct access upon the

13

Indian tribes to the federal forum.

14

In the light of this history, it was perfectly

15

natural that the Navajos turned to the federal court

16

when they filed their complaint for a declaration of

17

their federal rights only to the waters of the Little

18

Colorado and for a quantification of those rights under

19

the doctrines of the Winters case and the more recent

20

case of California against Arizona.

21

How, the Navajos filed this complaint in the

22

District Court of Airzona on the 17th of April, 1979.

At that time, there was no statute for stream

adjudication in the state of Arizona.

QUESTION;

3
4

Would it be related to the quantity

of water in the stream?
MR. RIFKIND;

It would of course be related to

5

the water -- quantity of waters in the stream, but in

6

the most generalized sense of that term only, not

7

because some other user is applying it beneficially to

8

his property.

9

The point that I am trying to make is this,

10

that if this case, Indian and non-Indian rights, were

11

tried in one court, you would find that the Indian claim

12

would have to be encapsulated in a separate proceeding

13

and treated separately as in fact has been done in quite

14

a number of proceedings which have already taken place,

15

because the two don’t mingle, and that's what I mean

16

when I say that there is no duplication, there is no

possibility of conflicting decision, there is no

18

piecemealing in the sense in which the term is used in

19

the Akin case.

If Arizona brings an action for

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

6

please the Court, the guestion we have asked ourselves

7

in respect of these cases is whether it is unavoidable

8

to have an all or nothing solution to have water rights

9

adjudication, Indian, non-Indian, federal, all in the

10

state court or all in the federal court, as indeed Akin

11

suggests must be the result.
It has seemed to us, after some years of

12
13

experience under Akin, we ask the Court to revisit only

14

that aspect of the Akin holding.

15

indeed possible, practical, and desirable to divide the

16

task between the federal and state courts.

On the

Hr. Claiborne, since in the last

6

analysis it all depends in these dry western states on

7

how much water there is, how do you handle the

8

determination by both the federal court and the state

9

court of different quantities of available water?

10

HR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice O'Connor, I don't know

11

whether your question suggests that either decree will

12

adjudicate more water than is available.

13

that specter has been put forward.

14

QUESTION:

If not --

No, a different determination of

15

how much water is available.

16

depending on who is deciding the case.

17

I don't think

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Those figures can vary

Justice O'Connor, all we

18

suggest the task of the federal court will be is simply

19

to determine adversely to all those who want to contest

20

it in the federal court forum the number of acre feet of

21

water to which Indian reservations are entitled and the

22

priority date appropriate.

23

QUESTION:

But doesn't that depend in part on

24

how much water there is?

25

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Only to the extent that the

1

number of acre feet which a river bed bore might be

2

greater, computing so many acre feet per acre for each

3

acre than is available.

4

simply says, and there may be earlier priorities — of

5

course, that would have to give way — the federal court

6

merely makes the determination that assuming enough

7

water is available, the reservation is entitled to so

8

many acre feet per year.

Otherwise, the federal court

That is all and as far as the federal court

9
10

goes.

The state court in its comprehensive adjudication

11

takes that decree and places it in the proper sequence.

12

If there is an earlier priority date, it must be

13

satisfied before the reservation claim.

14

the reservation claim will be an earlier one, and the

15

adjudicated claims for others will come afterwards.

tfore usually,

The state decree at the end of the day will be

16
17

comprehensive and will include this determination, this

18

quantification accomplished by the federal court.

19

seems to us that that is indeed the way in which state

20

proceedings have proceeded when it is all in the state

21

court.

The reasons why it is appropriate for the

24

which are for federal water determined in accordance

25

with federal law principles are too obvious to need

1

elaboration if the tfcCarren Amendment did not make that

2

solution impossible.

3

The Akin decision was at pains to point out

4

that federal jurisdiction over water claims was net in

5

any way diminished by the passage of that legislation,

6

and accordingly, as my brother, Judge Rifkind, pointed

7

out, if the reservation of that federal jurisdiction was

8

to be meaningful, it must apply in at least some cases.

9

If these cases, particularly the Montana

10

cases, in which the claims were filed in federal court

11

almost five years before the state in its leisurely way

12

prepared itself to begin an adjudication, and the

13

federal court effectively sat on those complaints for

14

that length of time, do not satisfy the Akin factors, it

15

is hard to imagine one that does.

16

Now, we have urged the Court to draw a clearer

17

line only because the jurisdictional skirmishing that

18

has ensued from the decision seems to us extremely

19

wasteful and acrimonious.

20

There is an ingredient in this case that was

21

not present in Akin, and it is one of some importance,

it seems to us.

desirable to attempt to accommodate that Congressional

Amendment, if that can be done.

6

It seems to us that it can indeed be done, and

at least when the tribes invoke that jurisdictional base

as they have in all of the Arizona cases, and as they

have in most of the Montana cases, by intervening, that

choice should be respected, and it is a choice which

11

respects the Congressional judgment that Indian claims

12

are more appropriately adjudicated in the federal

13

court.

14

And that can live together with the concerns

15

of the McCarren Amendment, which are to avoid a

16

situation in which a tribe or the United States stands

17

aloof, refusing to participate in the adjudication of

18

its water rights in any forum.

19

as by a joint effort of state and federal courts all of

20

the rights in the stream can be adjudicated

21

contemporaneously --

22

QUESTION*

But we say that so long

Would you say, Mr. Claiborne, that

23

the claims of the United States in the Montana case were

24

properly referred to the state court, or were there any?

25

MR. CLAIBORNE;

There were claims of the

own claims.

No, no, I mean,

the United States'

Were they properly referred to the state?

4

MR. CLAIBORNE;

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. CLAIBORNE;

7

QUESTION;

We say they were.

Under -- under Colorado River?
Under Colorado River --

So those factors in Colorado River

8

would not only authorize but require the reference of

9

the United States claims to the state court, but not the

10
11

Indian claims?
MR. CLAIEORNE;

Yes.

Well, we are content

12

whether we would be entitled to resist that referral to

13

the state court to say that the special reasons for

14

preserving the federal jurisdiction of Indian claims

15

most obviously indicated in the reservation of water

16

rights in Public Law 290 and Section 1362 --

17

QUESTION;

But it wouldn't -- I don't see how

18

you can say that the reference of the United States

19

claims was quite proper under Colorado River, and yet

20

the reference of the Indian claims were not under those

21

same factors.

22

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Akin didn't distinguish between

Indian claims and United States claims.
MR. CLAIBORNE;

The Akin court was not, at

least at the instance of the United States, invited to

71

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST, N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

focus on the special situation under the Acts of

2

Congress for Indian claims, most specifically, Section

3

1362.

4

invoking what Congress gave them, a right of entry to

5

the federal court, and it would be a meaningless gift it

6

can be taken away from them by the expedience of suing

7

the United States in state court.

8
9

Here we have, as was not true in Akin, tribes

QUESTION;

I think you really are, then,

asking that we really redo Colorado River with respect

10

to Indian claims, that those factors just — however

11

much they might be satisfied with respect to the claims

12

of the United States itself, are nevertheless either not

13

satisfied or there are additional factors that come into

14

being that must be brought to bear on Indian claims.

15

SR. CLAIBORNE;

I must candidly concede that

16

we are asking the Court to reconsider one aspect of Akin

17

in light of Section 1362, not involved there, and that

18

the experience under Akin has led us to invite the Court

19

to draw a firmer line.

20

We do point out that the federal courts would

21

-- the state courts would nevertheless, as they did in

22

the Wyoming case, have jurisdiction to adjudicate Indian

23

claims if neither the United States nor the tribe invoke

24

in a timely way its prerogative to remain in --

25

QUESTION*

But you would say what our rule

72
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

ought to be is a bright line rule.

2

way the United States cr the Indian tribe invoked the

3

jurisdiction of the federal court, the guantification

4

and the date of priority of the Indian claim should be

5

adjudicated by the federal court.
HR. CLAIBORNE;

6

Any time in a timely

We invite the Court to that

7

result, though we likewise endorse the in communi

8

position put forward by Judge Rifkind.
MR. CLAIBORNE.-

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Do you have anything

further, Mr. Kyi?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JON L. KYL, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN

13

NO. 81-2147 - REBUTTAL

14

MR. KYL;

15
16

All right.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court, yes, I do have some remarks.
The tribes and the government speak of history

17
18

and policy.

19

Amendment, that Congress's legislative intent was clear,

20

and that that is where policy issues should be

21

resolved.

22

in its Colorado River decision, and I suggest that most

23

of the suggestions of the tribes and the government are

24

indeed to revisit that case.

25

We believe that the history is the McCarren

This Court interpreted the McCarren Amendment

For example, the suggestion that the McCarren

73
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Amendment lid not waive Indian tribal sovereignty.

2

Indian tribal sovereignty is deemed waived because the

3

assertion of the claims is by the United States, and the

4

United States’s tribal — sovereign immunity is waived

5

under the McCarren Amendment.
The reading of the Congressional intent with

6
7

respect to Section 1362 that Mr. Claiborne just offered

8

to you would suggest to you that the Indian tribes have

9

a greater right to access to the federal courts under

10

Section 1362, which only eliminated the $10,000

11

jurisdictional barrier, than the United States has under

12

Section

13

Colorado River, a truly anomalous result.

13d5, which this Court was dealing with in

That is not what either Congress has intended

14
15

or what this Court would intend in the Colorado River

16

decision.

17

Mr. Pelcyger suggests that the McCarren

18

Amendment -- excuse me, that the disclaimer really

19

suggests that there is an absolute bar.

20

is not an absolute bar,

21

its prior decisions.

22

Apache tribe case, this Court specifically said that

23

even on reservations state laws may be applied to

24

Indians unless such application would interfere with

25

reservation self-government or impair a right granted or

The disclaimer

as this Court has suggested in

For example, in the Mescalero

1

reserved by federal law.

2

That was a New Mexico case.

3

is found in Arizona cases, in Montana cases, in

4

Washington cases, in many of the disclaimer states.

5

This Court has said on many prior occasions that the

6

absolute jurisdiction of the federal government does not

7

oust the state of all jurisdiction.

QUESTION»

Similar language

When confronted with a claim under

a disclaimer statute?
ME.

KYLi

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I am not

aware of what a disclaimer statute would be.
QUESTION»

No, with a disclaimer — I mean,

13

14

Mescalero, that you are referring to.

15

statement by the Court that you quote made in the

16

context of the disclaimer provision in the state's

17

constitution being argued?

18

MR. KYL»

Was that

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, no, the

19

disclaimers are occasionally mentioned in these cases,

20

but they have never been seen as a bar.

21

With respect to the theory of the government,

22

I want to allude particularly to the Navajo tribe,

23

because Justice O'Connor was making a point that has a

24

great deal of validity in these semi-arid states.

25

in terms of identifying legally what water has been

75

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

Both

1

appropriated, which is done in the state court

2

proceedings, and identifying physically how much water

3

is available, it is very important to be able to

4

integrate everything.

5

The Navajo tribe was put together in 17

6

different sections at 17 different times.

There are

7

claims of non-Indians interspersed among those various

8

parts of the Navajo Indian reservation.

9

situation exists with respect to other reservations.

That same

10

Whatever court is going to determine all of these rights

11

is going to have to have all of the parties before it to

12

hear all of the claims at the same time, identify the

13

various dates and the priorities, how much water is

14

physically available, what prior rights were

15

established, and then put it all together.

16

This is what Congress had in mind when it

17

adopted the McCarcen Amendment.

The legislative history

18

is clear that it was pointing to many of the various

19

state statutes that permitted precisely that.

20

Court in Footnote 2 of the Colorado decision referred to

21

the Arizona statutes as among those statutes that could

22

determine all of these rights,

23

declared on several prior occasions that the

24

adjudication of water rights are a unique kind of

25

litigation that require the — all of the parties before

This

and the Court has

76

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

the Court in a unitary proceeding.
Unless that is true, you have intolerable

3

conflicts between courts, for example, the

4

administration of the same water by a federal court on

5

the one hand and a state court on the other hand.

6

which court do the parties go if a conflict develops

7

with respect to the administration of the decree at a

8

later date?

9

To

The conflicts are intolerable.

And if that kind of a proposal is necessary to

10

satisfy the government's concern, it can easily be

11

addressed to Congress, which could then change the law

12

to try to address some of these policy considerations,

13

but it has not done so.

14

We submit, if it please the Court, that the

15

only way that the state of Arizona and the other arid

16

and semi-arid states of the west are going to finally

17

get a complete and binding determination of water rights

18

so that everyone, Indians and non-Indians alike, can

19

move forward, can develop their economies, is if all of

20

the parties are before the same court at the same time.

21

This Court in Colorado River said that the

22

rights of the Indians would not be imperiled by sending

23

them to state court.

24

any of the Indian tribes in the cases before you now

25

that the state courts of Arizona or Montana are hostile

There has been no suggestion by

77

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

to the Indian tribes, and in Colorado River you

2

specifically rejected the argument of the government.

3

You said that is an erroneous assumption, to assume that

4

if the Indian tribes have to go to state court, that

5

somehow state court judges are going to deprive them of

6

their rights.

7

In any event, this Court sits in final review

8

of any question which has been preserved that comes from

9

a state court.

We submit that these cases should be

10

returned to the district court, and that the state court

11

adjudications should be allowed to proceed.

12

Thank you.
