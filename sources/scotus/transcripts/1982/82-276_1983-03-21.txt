Mr. Bonderman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID BONDERMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BONDERMAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Ten years ago today, in fact virtually at this hour,

11

Petitioner Dirks was in the office of Stanley Goldblum, Chairman

12

of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of then

13

high flying Equity Funding Corporation of America.

14

White, it was at 10:00 in the morning, California time.

15

(Laughter)

16

MR. BONDERMAN:

Justice

Mr. Dirks was there to confont Mr. Goldblum with

17

uncorroborated allegations of a former officer — a fired former

18

officer of a subsidiary to the effect in relevant part that the

19

major foundations of the company, its life insurance subsidiary,

20

were a fraud and that the company was carrying on its books

21

substantial amounts of "phony policies" which were being sold to

22

reinsurers as though they were real in a Ponzi scheme.

23

Mr. Goldblum, of course, denied all, arranged for a

24

meeting which lasted much of the day with all of the other major

25

officers of the company in an endeavor to persuade Mr. Dirks
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that these allegations were entirely spurious and were being

2

circulated by a disgruntled former fired employee who, although

3

Mr. Dirks hadn't mentioned his name, Mr. Goldblum knew who it

4

was.

5

Secrist had come to Dirks ten days earlier with these

6

and other allegations, some of which ultimately proved to be

7

true, some of which proved to be false.

8

because Dirks had a reputation as an analyst who was willing to

9

investigate beyond just looking at reports, the bottom line

He had come to Dirks

10

financial analysis, because as the Court of Appeal below found

11

the Securities and Exchange Commission had a history of failing

12

to act promptly in dealing with what has come to be known as

13

the Equity Funding Scandal,

14

of its own former attorneys a year and a half earlier and having

15

taken essentially no action, a quick investigation which was

16

closed.

17

Dirks, but again concluding that there was nothing there and

18

not taking any action at that time.

the SEC having been informed by one

The SEC again being informed within two days of Mr.

19

Secrist had the idea that in view of the performance

20

by the regulators and in view of the notion within the company

21

that the company had connections through its associate general

22

counsel to the SEC, which made it clear that the SEC would never

23

act, and through its vice president of the Illinois Insurance

24

Commission, which also assured that the Insurance Commission

25

which had regulatory authority would never act, the only way
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to public's eyes what Secrist believed, though, as he admitted he

2

had no proof, was a major, perhaps the major fraud in corporate

3

America at the time was to have somebody like Dirks go out, do

4

such investigation as he could and to publicize those allega­

5

tions in the only way a securities analyst can by telling every­

6

body he can get his hands on with the result that the trading

7

in the stock would cause an adjustment in the price —

QUESTION:

Mr. Bonderman, we are dealing here, I

guess, only with the activities of Mr. Dirks in those few days
before he went to the SEC.
MR. BONDERMAN:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor,

from the 7th of March until the 26th of March.
QUESTION:

Why shouldn't he have gone in the first

14

place to the SEC and then gone ahead and done all of the things

15

that he did?

16
17
18

MR. BONDERMAN:

Well, there are two answers to that.

I would like to start with the second one if I might.
The second one is that the SEC's position is that

19

even if he had he would have violated the law because it is no

20

defense that you reported it to the SEC —

21

QUESTION:

Well, but I suppose you could argue to us

22

that it should be a defense that he reported it to the SEC.

23

That is another question.

24
25

MR. BONDERMAN:

That brings me to what I suppose,

perhaps, should have been my first.
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

It was reported to Dirks by Mr. Secrist that the SEC

2

was aware and had been informed in 1971.

3

Courts below so found —

QUESTION:

broker/dealer to the SEC?

6

point it is his obligation?

8

MR. BONDERMAN:

QUESTION:

Would you, or would you not?

Well, the answer to that is, I would say,

Does he ever, in your view, have an obliga­

tion?

11
12

You would acknowledge that at some

first, if he has an obligation to go to the SEC at all —

9
10

The

But isn't it his obligation to go as a

5

7

That was correct.

MR. BONDERMAN:

I believe not, but I believe that that

is not material here because under the facts present what he had

13

was a rumor, an unverified allegation, perhaps more than a rumor,

14

but certainly less than fact, of the sort that goes on in the

15

market all the time.

In fact, Stanley Sporkin,

the head of

16

the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement

17

at the time, who was called before Congress and asked why was

18

it that the SEC didn't take action when Dirks did go there on

19

the 26th —

20

QUESTION:

Well, if you would assume for purposes of

21

answering the question that his obligation as a licensee to be

22

a broker/dealer does obligate him to go to the SEC with the

23

information, then could you agree that he ought to go there

24

first?

25

MR. BONDERMAN:

I think the answer to that is no

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

because I believe that Mr. Dirks did, in fact, go to the SEC

2

himself although Secrist told him on the 19th of March that

3

Secrist had gone to the SEC — That turned out to be inaccurate.

4

Indirectly the information was brought to the SEC's attention

5

on the 9th — I believe that the record here is clear that

6

Mr. Dirks went to the SEC on the 26th at the very first time,

7

certainly the very first working day, that he had anything

8

beyond speculation allegation.

9

he and Mr. Blundell from The Wall Street Journal, who was, in

10

fact, the first person that Mr. Dirks talked to, did, in fact,

11

go to the SEC.

12

After he had checked it out,

I might add that Mr. Dirks had a very personal

13

additional reason for not going to the SEC because the last time

14

he was involved in an investigation, he had done just what you

15

suggest.

16

the ITT Hartford —

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BONDERMAN: Yes it is.

19

Mr. Dirks in that case had gone to the SEC because he

Some clients of his — This involved a prior case,

Is this in the record?
It is in the record.

20

heard from some of his clients that insider trading was going on,

21

and he went to the SEC and told them requesting that they please

22

keep his name out of it because his clients would not appreciate

23

his sharing their confidences with the SEC.

24

the SEC did was call up the clients and said, Dirks here is

25

alleging that you know thus and such about inside information

The first thing

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and inside trading in the Hartford case.

2

Dirks himself was personally disencouraged because of that

3

experience for going to the SEC before he believed he had facts,

4

which he did not have, we believe.

5

QUESTION:

Needless to say, Mr.

But, I suppose, the SEC as affirmed by the

6

Court of Appeals, though, found that the information he had

7

during the days before he went to the SEC was material specific

8

in detail?

9

MR. BONDERMAN:

Well, the answer to that is in part,

10

yes, although what the Commission really found was at least —

11

and the Administrator alleges the same thing — at least,

12

13
14
15

forgetting what happened earlier on, at least by the weekend
between the 23rd and 26th he had such information.
In fact, the information that Dirks had was brought
to the attention of Mr., Sporkin on a telephone call by Mr, Blunde 11

16

of The Wall Street Journal on the evening, of the 23rd of March

17

which happened to have been a Friday.

18

testified starting on the following Monday, the 26th, testified

19

for three days at the end of which time Mr. Sporkin

20

before Congress that the SEC had nothing but hearsay, innuendo

21

and rumor, and nothing on which it could act.

22

testified

That was the SEC's position and testimony before

23

Congress about what Dirks knew.

24

three days telling them.

25

Dirks came in and

That is after Dirks spent

I would like to talk about —

QUESTION:

2

MR. BONDERMAN:

3

QUESTION:

Before you go on with that —
Yes, sir.

— when a citizen, a private citizen, goes

4

to the SEC as they sometimes go to the FBI, Department of Justice

5

or a newspaper, are there any regulations first that could

6

guarantee them anonymity?

7

protections from liability for slander or libel,if they do it

8

in writing?

9
10

MR. BONDERMAN:

The answer to both questions is, as far

as I know, there are none.

11
12

Second, beyond that, are there any

QUESTION:

They go at their own risk, then, don't

they?

13

MR. BONDERMAN:

I believe they do.

In fact, you raise

14

a very good point because when Dirks started to make his checks

15

in the industry and ask people, look, you know how reinsurers

16

operate, is this scheme possible, because it made no sense.

17

was

18

don't say anything to anybody.

19

in trouble.

20

about what you say.

21

Ponzi scheme.

Is this scheme possible.

It

He was cautioned,

You are going to get yourself

There are libel laws here.

You be very cautious

So, the truth is that you are caught between a rock

22

and a hard place in the sense that an analyst like Dirks has no

23

access to the press.

24

was the first thing he did.

25

The testimony was that they cannot print a story on hearsay

He went to The Wall Street Journal.

That

They declined to print the story.

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

allegations.

2

They did not act on it, though they worked with Dirks,

3

and ultimately based on the information that Dirks uncovered

4

printed a story after the period of time we are talking about.

5

QUESTION:

Now, on the other side of this equation, if

6

it is an equation, I am not sure, if a person, an analyst, a

7

securities analyst has clients who depend upon him, would he be

8

at risk for a malpractice if he had information and did not

9

give it to them?

10

MR. BONDERMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

Well —

Is there any malpractice suit that has

reached that area yet?

13

MR. BONDERMAN:

One of the defenses raised by the

14

persons to whom Dirks gave information and who traded — and

15

let me just regress for a second to say, Dirks told literally a

16

hundred people about this, some of whom bought, some of whom

17

sold, some of whom did neither.

18

persons who sold were charged in this proceeding below, and

19

they defended themselves, in part, on the grounds that they

20

were caught with two fiduciary obligations, assuming for the

21

moment that this was inside information, which I do not believe

22

for a moment it is.

23

to their clients, pension funds for example, for whom they were

24

trustee.

25

to act for those trustees, and they have an obligation not to

Some of those — Five of those

They had .two fiduciary obligations.

Information comes to them.

One

They have an obligation

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

violate the law with respect to this information.

2

The Courts below, or this Commission because it never

3

got to the Court below, held that whatever your other fiduciary

4

obligations are, it gives you no license to violate these laws.

5

I think the question is an open one.

6

administrative law judge, but I am not aware of any further

7

decisions on that point.

8
9

It was decided by the

What happens here if we think about the public policy
implications of what was done, and, indeed, why the Solicitor

10

General and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the

11

criminal division filed a brief urging reversal, is that as one

12

commentator put it, you have here the biggest boon for the

13

successful commission and continuation of fraud that can be

14

imagined because what you have done to somebody in Dirks'

15

position is to tell him that the only thing he can do without

16

risking a securities violation is to do what counsel suggested

17

below, nothing.

That is to say to be silent.

18

Why do I say that?

19

Dirks himself did not trade.

20

he nor his company traded a single share.

21

everybody he could get his hands on, which included the auditors,

22

which included The Wall Street Journal, which included a whole

23

series of persons in the securities business, large and small,

24

as the SEC found.

25

calls.

Because you will recall that
He did not own any stock.

Neither

What he did was tell

He basically responded to other people's

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

3

QUESTION:

Could Mr. Dirks and his firm have traded

in the stock on their own during that interval of time?
MR. BONDERMAN:

Well, the answer to that is I think

4

there is an argument that they could, and I think there is an

5

argument that they could not.

6

QUESTION:

7

(Laughter)

8
9

What is your position?

MR. BONDERMAN:

My position is that if those members

of the court in Chiarella who expressed the view that mis­

10

appropriation of information is grounds under 10b-5 and 17 (a)

11

for violation, and the information came to Dirks on the theory

12

that he was going to disseminate it.

13

for his own private trading, it might be argued that he mis­

14

appropriated it.

15

stantial argument can be made based on that branch of Chiarella.

16

If he instead used it solely

I think that is wrong, but I think a sub­

I think there is no argument that can be made, no

17

reasonable argument that can be made, that where Seerist

18

reasonably concluded that the only way to get this out in view

19

of what Secrist understood to be the SEC's defaults in investi­

20

gating, and which the Court below found to the SEC's defaults

21

in investigating it, the only way to get this out was to do

22

what Dirks did.

23

There is no grounds under Chiarella to find that any person

24

breached any duty to any one.

25

QUESTION:

Dirks did not trade, but did get it out.

Would your — If the information that

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Mr. Dirks had received were merely adverse but not indicating

2

criminal conduct, would Petitioner have been liable as a tippee

3

for the failure to disclose?

4
5

MR. BONDERMAN:

I think the answer to that is probably

yes.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BONDERMAN:

Clearly yes.
That is correct.

The reason that he

8

is not liable here is because under no conceivable definition

9

of the term, insider information, as that has been used, inside

10

information, could this possibly be inside information.

11

is what the SEC forgot here.

12

That

They made the incredible — and I think it is —

13

incredible statement as the underlying basis for their rationale

14

in this case that Dirks should have known that this information

15

was intended by the company to remain confidential.

16

Indeed, it was.

Nobody who is committing a fraud

17

desires to have it circulated.

18

for the whole insider trading rules and regulations stemming

19

from Investors Management,

20

There was nothing improper about what Mr. Secrist chose to do.

21

But, yet that is the foundation

the notion of improper dissemination.

He had two choices as a fiduciary.

The fraud was

22

going on.

23

Commission suggests he should have, done nothing whatsoever

24

and allowed it to continue.

25

He could do either of two things.

He could, as the

Instead, he chose to follow a path which lead to its
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

disclosure sooner rather than later.

2

it is a proven fact in this case, so found by the Court of

3

Appeals that reporting this information to public officials got

4

nowhere in the past.

And, that is because, and

5

That isn't and should not come to anybody as a shock,

6

although this case is a little more aggregious as to what it is

7

that public officials overlooked because entire statutory

8

enforcement schemes, indeed the whole reason we have a 1Ob-5,

9

a private right of action at all, is a recognition that no

10

matter how well motivated an intention and whatever skillfull a

11

job they are doing, regulators simply cannot probe and uncover

12

all instances where enforcement is appropriate.

13

That is why we have private enforcement, not only in

14

10b-5, in the anti-trust statutes, throughout the federal regime.

15

It is why we have informers' rewards.

16

encourage dissemination and uncovery of fraud.

17

QUESTION:

It is why we try to

But, if you are right, and if there is

18

no accompanying obligation on Mr. Dirks to go right away to

19

the SEC and disclose the information, then that would build an

20

incentive to people who might uncover this information to con­

21

tinually, selectively disseminate it and to extend that time as

22

long as possible to maximize their profits.

23

MR. BONDERMAN:

Well, let me answer that this way, if

24

I might, Justice O'Connor.

25

Smith in Investors Management gave the right response to the

First of all, I think Commissioner

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

notion of selective dissemination.

2

has invented, and it means nothing.

3

dissemination means , if it means you did not make it public

4

because you did not put it on the wire, of course, they are

5

right.

That is a spit word the SEC
Because, what the selective

If it means that you chose a few people to select

8

for profit and did not try to get it out as broadly as possible,

9

that is not what was done here.

10

11
12

QUESTION:

The Court below found —

Well, but if you are right, it might be

done in the future for others.
MR. BONDERMAN:

If, in fact, someone uses it to line

13

their pocket in a direct sense, I think we have a different

14

case, and, indeed, maybe can have a different rule.

15

would like to suggest that the entire theoretical underpinnings

16

as — I am referring the Court, for example, to Professor

17

Easterbrook's seminal article and this suggests that there is

13

nothing wrong with the notion, if what you are talking about

19

is encouraging people to investigate fraud and the choice is

20

to have them not investigate fraud, what are the costs you

21

are willing to pay to encourage someone.

22

But, I

If, in fact, Dirks because of his own personality

23

did this essentially for free — He did, in fact, do it essentially

24

for free — his company received one indirect commission.

25

But, you cannot expect people to spend their own time and incur

costs to investigate fraud doing that.

QUESTION:

In fact, it has never been

That goes for all of us

Would the sanction put on Dirks apply to

anybody else who is not a broker/dealer?
MR. BONDERMAN:

That depends if you believe that Judge

Wright's single-judge opinion creating a broker/dealer duty to

11

rationale, I suppose it would apply to all broker/dealer

It would apply to anybody else who has

an ethical standard of special care.
QUESTION:

If that were the

I am sorry?

What if The Wall Street Journal had

published the information?
MR. BONDERMAN:

Well, if the question is whether they

would now have a privilege against the libel laws, I do not think

23

they would.

24

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

What about the — Could the SEC

get after them?
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. BONDERMAN:

I think even the SEC would admit that

2

publishing it in The Wall Street Journal makes it public.

3

it out over the wire makes it public.

4

admit that.

I think even the SEC would

Beyond that, they will not go.

That

is publicizing —

MR. BONDERMAN:

QUESTION:

10

Putting

As I understand the SEC —

Well, if Dirks had put out a big flyer and

handed it out in a supermarket, would he had been any better off?

n

MR. BONDERMAN:

No, because the SEC takes the position

12

and did take the position here, in fact, the administrative law

13

judge said it was a position "of great merit."

14

way you can protect yourself against a charge of fraud is to make

15

it public in the sense of putting it on a tape —

17

QUESTION:

That the only

Could the SEC have got after some of Dirks'

tippees —

MR. BONDERMAN:

QUESTION: — who are not broker/dealers or anything

else?

MR. BONDERMAN:

QUESTION:

25

They did.

They did.

So, anybody who was a tippee using inside

information is subject to SEC sanctions?
MR. BONDERMAN:

Yes, because the theory — The SEC has

QUESTION:

2

MR. BONDERMAN:

Including a newspaper, I suppose?
If the newspaper traded or someone used

3

it to trade and it was not making it public. I suppose you could

4

think of a case of some newspaper with very small circulation in

5

some little town in South Carolina —

QUESTION:

Well, what about Dirks, I said.

What if he

7

had not told any of his clients?

8

so and so is a fraudulent outfit and stuck it up at the corner of

9

something and Wall Street?

10

MR. BONDERMAN:

He just made a sign that said

That is not public disclosure because

11

the persons who do not go by Broad and Wall, for example, people

12

trading in Seattle, Washington never find out about it.

13

In fact, one of the trading defendants, Dreyfus, did

14

Was anybody at the Commission censured?

Let me address the question of the information to the
SEC, which is set forth in both of our briefs.

The events that

are involved in this case took place in 1973.

18
19

Was anybody at SEC censured?

So far as I am aware, no, Your Honor.

15
16

But while his

role negated any sanction to be imposed upon him as a result of

14

On the basis of that information, they

the SEC called to say that two employees of the SEC, one Mercado
and one Templeton, had information about irregularities at Equity
Funding.

We asked that they be sent in.

they were very circumspect.

They were sent in, but

They did not tell the kind of story

that the lawyer promised that they would.
We followed up on it, and we were unable to get that
information.

At a later time, the attorney for Mercado who

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

became concerned that his client had gone to the SEC unaccompanied

2

by counsel then came — and then there is an issue which counsel

3

raises as to whether an offer of immunity was made whereby Mercado

4

allegedly would discuss that.

5

it was never perceived that such an offer was made and so that

6

matter was not pursued.

7

From the SEC's staff's memorandum

On the 9th of March, which was two days after Secrist

8

told Dirks the story he had told him, the California Insurance

9

Commission representative contacted a staff member of the Los

10

Angeles office of the SEC to reveal in a very vague way that some

11

allegations were being made.

12

the California authority should look into them and if they promise,

13

if they bring proof to contact us again.

14

And, the response was made that

This has to be understood, I think, in the context that

15

at that time approximately 10,000 complaints were received —

16

this is back in 1973 — by the SEC.

17

20,000 a year.

18

Today it is closer to

So, the very detailed hard story that Dirks knew and

19

received from Secrist, and which, by the way, he corroborated

20

in great detail by talking at length with six former and present

21

employees of Equity Funding, was not brought to the SEC, rather

22

a much vaguer, softer information.

23

Now, it may assist analysis of this case to view Dirks

24

as did the administrative law judge in this case as proceeding

25

on two tracks.

On the first track, which is what has been

he believed was a fraud.

found had Dirks confined his disclosure to The Wall Street Journal

20

that it views the role of analyst as very important and said

that they perform valuable functions in putting forth their

22

analytical skills in evaluating data and then putting them

23

together in what has sometimes been referred to as a mosaic.

24

They take perhaps what might be inconsequential bits

25

of information to others and because of other information they

they can make suggestions as to the company will do or will not

That is different, said the Commission, from the kind of

QUESTION:

Most individuals do not have access to a wire

service that they can just go to their office and start typing

out a message.

14

MR. GONSON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

You are

15

raising a question that has been asked before and that is assuming

16

somebody is not in a position to compel public disclosure of an

17

inside fact that person knows, and very well established case

18

law, and, as a matter of fact, discussed in this Court's Chiarella

19

decision establishes that person may not trade.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask one other question, please.

21

Supposing during the period between, I think it was March 7th and

22

the time he went out to the west coast, he had nothing but the

23

Secrist source of information, which were the bad facts but no

24

verification, was he then under a duty to refrain or disclose?

25

MR. GONSON:

That raises the question, Your Honor, as
35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

to whether that information was material.

That, of course, is a

closer question then much later when he had confirmed that with
six former Equity Funding insiders.
The Commission found that it was material, that it
5

was very specific.

6

excuse me — which Dirks himself said was a credible source.

7

was a three-and-one-half-hour, very detailed conversation.

8

The Commission found that yes, it was.

9

It came from a source which Secrist —
It

But, I am not

sure that this Court need reach that because trades, of course,

10

were made throughout that period and most of them at the very

11

end of the period when, by that time, the information had been

12

confirmed in great detail by others who had seen or witnessed

13

others participate in the fraud —

14

QUESTION:

But the duty arises when the information

15

becomes material, and, of course, you are not entirely sure when

16

it is material until you get the additional information, I guess.

17

MR. GONSON:

18

Well, the question of materiality is a

question, I suppose that you should probably assess at the time -

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GONSON:

21

That is what triggers the duty?
That is correct, the materiality of the

information.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Gonson, we are not giving you much of

23

a chance to argue you case, but there are so many interesting

24

questions.

QUESTION:

Yes.

I think one might assume that the

17

information was no longer accurate or dependable — not in this

18

case where the fraud was manifest.

19

MR. GONSON:

Well, that raises a number of questions,

20

Your Honor.

21

I think the fact that he knew about it a long time is not as

22

relevant as the fact that the person who is receiving it learned

23

it only then.

24

course, we would have to look for a duty, which I would like to

25

get to, and if it was received in a breach of duty and the

Was the information material?

Was it then public?

The question then would be was it material.

Of

QUESTION:

Would an obligation that Dirks' clients

owed to their buyers have anything to do with inside information?

It would not, would it?

Their duty, Your Honor, is derivative of

Secrist's duty in this case.

Well, why is that?

It is just that they

If there

was no duty of confidentiality owed to the company, then the
company probably would have no action.

The facts support the answer as yes, Your

Secrist testified that he told Dirks this information

hoping that Dirks would give that information in turn to his

clients, that the clients would trade and that the impact of the

cause the regulators to notice.

22

course, persons would be amenable to that proceeding only if

there was —

In the Commission's view, Dirks' conduct

was bad but Secrist's was not?
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

/ MR. GONSON:

I suppose, perhaps, you are drawing an

2

implicit assumption based upon the fact that the Commission chose

3

to proceed against Dirks and not against Secrist.

4

QUESTION:

I leave the assumption drawing to you.

5

QUESTION:

It is just that there is a particular kind

6

of remedy available against Dirks that is not available against

7

Secrist.

8

MR. GONSON:

9

And, of course, while we are here in this Court only

That is exactly correct.

10

with regard to Dirks, the Commission’s administrative proceeding

11

was against the five institutions who had received the informa­

12

tion from Dirks as well.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Could a staff member from the SEC ever be

an insider in terms of the statute?
MR. GONSON:

Oh, certainly, Your Honor.

We have all

16

kinds of elaborate rules that prevent staff members from trading

17

on securities.

18

QUESTION:

When information first came to them from

19

whatever sources about this, is there some procedure to deal

20

with failures to act as distinguished from acting to take advan­

21

tage of the inside information?

22

MR. GONSON:

That is if the staff members had been

23

derelict in their duty in not following through.

24

administrative procedures —

25

QUESTION:

Yes, there are

Disciplinary procedures, I take it?

4

complaints a year that may later turn out to be something that

5

the staff persons at that time felt were not as important as

6

other complaints.

7

8

QUESTION:

I get from that that you suggest that the

SEC is sometimes skeptical of the information it gets.

9

10

I do not know whether that was so in 1973.

MR. GONSON:

Well, sometimes, Your Honor, it is a

question, I think, of case load and volume where —

11

QUESTION:

I would not assume that you, that the SEC

12

would believe and accept every rumor that comes to their

13

attention.

14
15

MR. GONSON:

No, of course, it certainly does not, and

it investigates a great many of them.

16

QUESTION:

When there are repeated rumors focusing on

17

one area, that certainly should trigger SEC action, should it

18

not?

19

MR. GONSON:

It generally does, Your Honor, if you are

20

talking about a large number of complaints that are made or

21

complaints over a period of time, but what we are talking about

here is a complaint, if you will call it that, in 1971 then

Now, this Court recognized in the Chiarella case in

16

discussing the traditional prohibitions against insider trading

17

by insiders and their tippees that the duty to disclose inside

18

information arises not from any obligation to the corporate

19

source of the information, but from the "relationship between the

20

corporate insider and the stockholders of the corporation."

21

The Court there referred among other sources to the

22

Commission's Katie Roberts decision in which the Commission had

23

recognized that a relationship of trust and confidence exists

24

between the shareholders of a corporation and its insiders giving

25

rise to a duty of disclosure in order to prevent a corporate
43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

insider from taking advantage of the uninformed shareholders.

2

The Court also refers to this Court's 1909 decision

3

in Strong v. Repide essentially for a similar proposition.

4

the duty to shareholders is separate from the duty of confiden­

5

tiality that the insider also owes to the corporation.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gonson, may I interrupt you?

If we

12

just concentrate on duty to shareholders, how would the financial

13

interests of the shareholders have been served by a total dis­

14

closure of the fraud?

15

MR. GONSON:

Of course, at any time when the fraud

16

would become known, the stock would become worthless or virtually

17

worthless and whoever would be holding it at that time would

18

have worthless stock.

the other direction.

7

9

MR. GONSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

In the Chiarella case

this Court quoted Judge Learned Hand's reasoning in Gratz v.
Claughton, a Second Circuit case, that "the director or officer

10

assumed a fiduciary relation to the buyer by the very sale; for

11

it would be a sorry distinction to allow him to use the advan­

had become one."
And, our position and the Commission said, Your Honor,
that just as Secrist could not trade his tippees, Dirks could not
trade and Dirks' tippees, the institutions, could not trade.

That intention was

Everybody who is in that chain ought to be disabled

from trading on that information.
QUESTION:

Again, I will ask what I asked a moment ago.

If Dirks and/or his tippees had disclosed everything they knew

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to their buyer, would that have discharged their duty to the

2

stockholders of Equity?

3

MR. GONSON:

Yes, it would, Your Honor.

If there were

4

a way, yes, certainly.

5

the buyer of the stock is given full disclosure, all the facts,

the material facts known by the seller —

That is the principle of the case.

That discharges the duty not only to the

buyer but to the stockholders?

MR. GONSON:

As I mentioned by quoting —
Does that satisfy the duty to the stockholders;
Yes, Your Honor.

When I speak to duty of

20

the stockholders, I am referring it to the possible other side of

21

the case where the insider, as was the case in Strong v. Repide

22

in this Court, buys the stock, then, of course, he would breach

23

the duty to that stockholder in purchasing without disclosure of

material information because of the fiduciary relationship that

he bears.

Mr. Gonson, I just want to be clear about

this, but as I understand your position, it is perfectly immaterial

Because I believe it is not us, but the

He has a duty
