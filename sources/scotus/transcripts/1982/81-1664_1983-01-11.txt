4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD F. SILEO, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. SILEOs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

This case is about two union officers, David

8

Lang and Eugene Light, who participated in an unlawful

9

strike at Three Mile Island on August 30, 1977.

The

10

immediately apparent issue is whether petitioner was

11

justified in relying upon two prior arbitration

12

decisions between the parties.

13

decisions imposed upon union officers greater duties

14

than those imposed upon rank-and-file employees; namely,

15

not only not to participate in the strike but to urge

16

others from participating in the strike.

Those arbitration

For breach of those duties the union officers

17
18

could be disciplined more severely than the

19

rank-and-file employees, according to the arbitration

20

decisions.

21

suspensions from employment and the others up to 10

22

days’ suspension from employment.

23

Here Lang and Light received 25 days*

I describe that issue as the immediately

24

apparent one because there are two fundamental,

25

far-reaching issues under federal labor law as to the

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

impact of this case generally throughout this country on

2

the no-strike promises in various contracts, and

3

virtually all contracts, as a matter of fact, and on the

4

vitality of arbitration.

5

First of all, should the National Labor

6

Relations Board be allowed to marshal all its weaponry

7

in blatant interference with the collective bargaining

8

process, thereby relieving the union of the full scope

9

of its no-strike clause obligation?
If the Labor Board is successful in this, it

10
11

will eviscerate what little is left of what has already

12

been called the largely chimerical and illusory remedies

13

that are available to an employer for violation of a

14

no-strike clause.
That no-strike promise, as this Court well

15
16

knows, is the most important promise that a union makes

17

to the employer, particularly important, I might add, to

18

this public utility employer, that not only operates a

19

nuclear site but has 24 hours a day continuous service

20

in all its operations, as is noted and acknowledged in

21

several different places in the collective bargaining

22

agreement.

23

The second vital long-range issue involved in

24

this case is whether the National Labor Relations Board

25

should be allowed to dangerously erode this Court *s

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Steelworkers Trilogy cases or whether that foundation of

2

industrial peace will remain unshaken.

3
4

This case has generated widespread interest
throughout the entire country.
QUESTIONS

5

Well, Mr. Sileo, in your petition

6

you raise a second question that I take is independent

7

of the arbitration problem.
MR. SILEO*

8
9

Rehnquist.

That is correct, Justice

find that second issue is whether independent

10

of arbitration there is a higher duty on rank-and-file

11

employees irrespective of whether there have been

12

arbitration decisions.

13

this Court's disinclination to make decisions on the

14

broadest possible basis.

15

strong on the point you raised as well as on the

16

arbitration point.

Justice Rehnquist, I recognize

We think that our case is very

We have concentrated on the arbitration point

17
18

because we think we have the very strongest case in that

19

area.

20

operation of law argument which we raise in our briefs

21

and which the amiciae raise in their briefs; namely,

22

that there is a duty arising out of their positions.

23

And certainly there have been three members of the Labor

24

Board in recent years that have adhered to that

25

position, and there is a body of arbitral authority that

But we certainly are not running away from the

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

adheres to that position.
But if I may return to the thrust of the

3

arbitration argument, the brief background with respect

4

to this case is that in September 1980 the National

5

Labor Relations Board handed down its decision, which

6

was consistent with the per se Precision Castings rule,

7

which was shortlived; namely, that disciplining union

8

officers more severely than rank-and-file employees was

9

in and of itself discriminatory, a violation, and they

10
11

treated as irrelevant the arbitration decisions.
In November of 1981 the Third Circuit Court of

12

Appeals rejected the per se approach of Precision

13

Castings, but nevertheless found against petitioner,

14

holding that in order for there to be a greater duty it

15

must be in the precise language, those greater duties

16

for the union officers must be in the precise language

17

of the collective bargaining agreement document itself.

18

And the Third Circuit discounted the arbitration

19

decisions that petitioner had relied upon.

20

There have been some recent cases in this area

21

of the law.

One of them handed down by the National

22

Labor Relations Board was Consolidation Coal.

There

23

were five Board members, at that time anyway.

There are

24

four now; there will be two new appointments within a

25

few months.

This whole area is in a state of flux as

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

far as the Labor Board is concerned.
Those five Board members handed down four

opinions.

summarized in the Board's brief at pages 32 and 33,

Contrarywise, in February of 1982 the Circuit

13

Fournelle case, written by Judge Harry T. Edwards# who

14

has labor expertise and recognition throughout the

15

country.

16

where under similar circumstances to these there had

17

been a prior arbitration decision# that prior

18

arbitration decision had imposed greater duties upon

19

union officers than rank-and-file employees, the kinds

20

of duties that we have in this case here, those kinds of

21

greater duties.

22

In that decision Judge Edwards found that

Under those circumstances, the Circuit Court,

23

24

might be disciplined more severely and found further

We had, in the words of the court,

Judge Edwards relied very heavily upon this

Court's Steelworkers Trilogy cases, and particularly the

part and parcel of the collective bargaining process,

where this Court said —

QUESTION:

13

MR. SILEO:

14

QUESTION*

Mr. Sileo.
Yes.
May I ask you on the arbitration

.15

point, the arbitration clause in the contract that was

16

in effect said that a decision by an arbitrator shall be

17

binding for the term of this agreement.

18

clause in the preceding agreements at the time that the

19

arbitrations were made?

20

MR. SILEO:

Was that same

That clause has remained the same.

21

Justice O'Connor, throughout the life of these parties

22

for the term of this agreement.

23

QUESTION:

24

arbitration clause?

25

Does that have a bearing on your

MR. SILEO:

We think not at all, Justice

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

O’Connor.

2

certainly should not turn on a phrase for the term of

3

the agreement which appears as surplusage throughout the

4

agreement in a number of different provisions, 7.8, 7.9,

5

7.10, 1.5, the very recognition clause that wherein the

We think that a case of this magnitude

/

6

Metropolitan Edison recognizes the union and agrees that

7

it will not — that it will not bargain with any other

8

union during — at the conclusion of the agreement.

9

We think that it is just surplusage.

We think

10

further that the union has in effect conceded that

11

because in the second arbitration decision — namely,

12

the Seidenberg decision -- there was no challenge to the

13

first arbitration decision on that basis, Justice

14

0’Connor.
In the Alderfer decision about which we wrote

15
16

— namely, that decision in which the arbitrator had

17

said that a refusal to cross a picket line was a

18

violation of the contract -- in that decision there was

19

a subsequent challenge, I should say, before the

20

National Labor Gelations Board, there was a stipulation

21

that a refusal to cross the picket line, as in this

22

case, represented an unlawful strike.
That is contrary to Board law, as a matter of

23
24

fact.

There is D.S. Steel and cases that have been

25

cited in the Board’s brief to that effect.

And yet the

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

union recognized that refusal to cross a picket line in

2

the context of these parties was a violation.

3

the reason why it recognized it is because of the

4

Aldefer award back in 1972 — early '73, I should say.

5

And it is our contention that that makes very clear that

6

the union recognized all of these decisions as having a

7

continuing effect.
All that -- all,of the provisions of the

8

9

collective bargaining agreement were for the term of the

10

agreement.

11

part and parcel of the agreement.

12

Surely,

This was simply repeating that which was

QUESTIONS

Do you think the arbitrator back in

13

the previous arbitrations had to be interpreting the

14

terms of the contract to decide whether the greater

15

punishment could be issued or whether there were greater

16

duties or whether there was'a waiver?

17

MR . SILEO*

The arbitrator interpreted the

18

terms of the contract and took into consideration, as

19

this Court admonished arbitratiors to do, industrial

20

common law.

21

QUESTION*

Because the decisions of the

22

arbitrators in these two instances were not complete

23

enough to let us know what the arbitrator was really

24

basing it on?

25

MR. SILEO*

Well, I think it is clear that the

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

arbitrator definitely did refer to industrial common

2

law.

3

certainly took into effect 11.1, the no-strike clause.

4

And there is no reason why we should not further presume

5

that the arbitrator —

6

However, we can presume that the arbitrator

QUESTIONS

What could he have looked at other

7

than the no-strike clause, do you think, to determine

8

that there had been a waiver or —

9

MR. SILEOs

Well, I -- that -- one of our

10

points, of course. Justice O’Connor, is that he didn't

11

have to determine there was a waiver, he determined that

12

there was a contractual violation.

13

contractual violation.

14

Okay.

There was a

And in making that determination, he took into

15

account, we contend, 11.1, the no-strike clause? 12.2,

16

the responsibility of the International; 9.4 the

17

additional rights that union officers have under the

18

contract; the continuous service provisions, 2.7, 6.4(a)

19

and 6.3(a); all those continuous service provisions

20

which underline how important it was for this employer

21

to have such continous service.

22

common law, as this Court said in the Steelworkers

23

Trilogy, in Warrior, industrial common law certainly is

24

something to be looked at.

25

And yes, the industrial

But it is our contention. Justice O’Connor,

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the waiver issue has nothing to do with this case.

2

It is our contention that this is a contractual claim

3

case, barring the issue that Justice Rehnquist raised as

4

to operation of law.

What is the waiver issue?

their case in bringing up what the waiver issue is.
However —

11

QUESTION*

Could you just describe it and if —

12

MR. SILEO*

Yes.

What they’re contending,

13

Justice Rehnquist, is that at the time — at the time

14

Wayne Howard, the arbitrator in this case in 1973, came

15

down with his decision and at the time of the Seidenberg

16

decisions a couple of years later, that those decisions

17

didn’t constitute a waiver of the statutory right which

18

the Labor Board and the unions see in this case.

19

no statutory right in this case.

bound to carry it out.

23

We see

MR. SILEOs

I don't see that as being a

Okay.

Well, of course, that’s —

24

our point is that this is a contractual claim case and

25

not a statutory right case.

Our claim is that in order

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

In this case this Court, consistent with its

21

teachings, can promote the national labor policy of

22

industrial — of encouraging industrial peace through

23

the collective bargaining process, including

24

arbitration, and it can do so without infringing upon

25

the functions of the National Labor Relations Board.

7

It was admonished

It was told to

In this case, we submit, the Labor Board

8

should accommodate itself to arbitration.

In this case,

9

we submit that there is — because there is a
«

10

contractual claim rather than an unfair labor practice

11

issue, that makes inapposite respondent’s reliance upon

12

authority which, in turn, cites this Court’s decisions

13

in Acme, Strong, CCC Plywood, and Carey.

14

As a matter of fact, those holdings do not

15

govern this situation, and there is language in those

16

holdings which we have cited at page 29 of our principal

17

brief and pages 8 and 9 of our reply brief, which are

18

helpful to us in this particular case.

19

The contractual claim here was settled in May

20

of 1973 when Wayne Howard, the first arbitrator, came

21

down with his decision imposing greater duties upon

22

union officers.

23

That remained the law of the parties, the law

24

of that shop, unless reversed in negotiations or by a

25

subsequent arbitrator.

Not only was it not reversed by

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a subsequent arbitrator, it was reaffirmed by a

2

subsequent arbitrator.

It was also reaffirmed by the

3

union in various ways.

The very same two union officers

4

involved in this dispute four years before had

5

involvement in another unfair labor practice strike.

7

unlawful strike.

later in this case.

testimony, they were the ones entrusted with the

15

responsibility of determining whether or not they should

16

grieve their own cases and other cases.
Lang testified at the Joint Appendix, the

17

1

there was an arbitration hearing in September of 1975

2

before Arbitrator Jacob Seidenberg.

3

At the time of that hearing there was no

4

challenge by the union to the fact of the duties.

The

5

only challenge was as to whether the particular union

6

officers had fulfilled their duties.

7

Seidenberg found that in a couple of instances they had

8

fulfilled their Howard duties — although he did not use

9

the word "Howard duties," clearly he was talking about

the same duties — and as a matter of fact, found that

that the union didn’t challenge in the arbitration

2

arising from the second negotiations the contract was

signed on behalf of this union by the very same two

individuals, Lang and Light.

not unknown for them to change their policies, and if I

20

may use the word, there is some waffling that has gone

21

on in many areas of law, including this, because as I am

sure you are familiar from reading the briefs in this

23

area of the law, prior to 1977, Justice Rehnquist’s

2

there was a second issue.

3

At that time, prior to 1977, the National

4

Labor Relations Board had held that it was not necessary

5

to have an arbitration decision or duties spelled out.

As a matter of fact, it was sufficient that there were

union officers and greater — and greater duties were

presumed and greater penalties could be imposed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. COKE*

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

5

Union officers Light and Lang engaged in the

6

same unauthorized refusal to work as did the company's

7

other employees, yet they received suspensions of 29

8

days, were warned that they would be discharged the next

9

time, while the other employees received only 5 to

10
11

10-day suspensions.
The notices issued to Lang and Light made

12

clear that they had received the enhanced discipline

13

because they were union officers.

14

position that such a disciplinary standard constitutes

15

disparate treatment that forseeably discourages

16

employees from engaging in the protected activity of

17

assisting the union by serving as union officers.

18

QUESTION*

It is the Board's

What is the Board’s view about the

19

posture of the union leaders in terms of whether

20

rank-and-file should follow their directions; for

21

example, when they say don't go on a strike?

22

any Board law on that?

23

MR. COME:

Is there

Well, it only comes up insofar as

24

QUESTION.*

Well, isn't it —

3

MR. COME;

-- it perfectly clear that the

4

Board’s position is not to say that union officers enjoy

5

any right to engage in unprotected strikes.

6

position permits the employer to discipline a union

7

officer for engaging in an unauthorized work stoppage to

8

the same extent that any other employee could be

9

disciplined.

The Board’s

Secondly, if there is evidence that the union

10
11

officer actively led the strike or instigated it, the

12

Board's position would permit more severe discipline.

13

There is no such finding in this case.

14

Appeals sustained the Board's finding that Light and

15

Lang did not actively lead this strike nor call it.

16

a matter of fact, they made every effort to stop the

17

strike, and they were ultimately successful in getting

18

the picket line removed so that the men could return to

work.

QUESTION:

I am going to ask you a question.

Mr. Come —
MR. COME:

Surely.

QUESTION:

— if you will slow down a minute

and wait for me.

Does the Board make any distinction

between an act of management in disciplining union
leaders which is intended as a subterfuge by management
to simply get at the union leaders and penalize them for
being union leaders on the one hand, and an effort by
management to treat union leaders as being more
responsible than rank-and-file for the strike because
they are union leaders and you expect that of someone
who is the head of an organization?
MR. COME:

Well, of course, your first

situation, if you could prove bad motive, you would have
the classic violation of 8(a)(3).
QUESTION:

But assume you don't prove that.

though?

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. COME*

You can’t prove bad motive, it is

the Board’s position, absent the effect of a contract
which might impose higher responsibilities on union
officers, and that is the second issue in this case.
The mere act of disciplining a union leader or officer
who did not actively instigate or lead the strike is
discrimination which has the forseeable effect of
discouraging the protected activity of serving in union
office.

As a matter of fact, it is inherently

destructive of that right.
I might say that the four Courts of Appeals
that have considered this naked proposition have agreed
with the court — or the Board.

The most recent

decision is by Judge Gee, writing for the Fifth Circuit
in South Central Bell.
Your Honor.

And the reason for it is this,

Unauthorized work stoppages, whether they

are an expression of resentments in the plant or as
here, the result of the employee’s aversion to crossing
another union's picket line, often do not begin under
the leadership of a union officer.

This is shown by the

facts of this case.
Following the August 4 work stoppage,
President Lang told the members at a meeting that the
International had said that under the contract they were
obligated to cross the picket line.

23

QUESTIONS

Was Lang an employee?

ME. COKE;

Lang was an employee.

He was also

an elected official.
QUESTION;

Did he participate in the strike?

QUESTIONS

Isn't it an essential ingredient of

the whole industrial picture that the Board wants and
unions want members to follow the leader?
MR. COME;

But in a wildcat strike the union

officer may well believe that he will be most effective
with the men or women in getting the unauthorized
strikes ended if he does not cross that picket line but
instead devotes his energies, as Lang and Light did
here, to removing the picket line.
As the Seventh Circuit pointed out in Heist,
for the union officer to take the additional step of
crossing that line is often suicidal because he
completely depreciates any credibility that he had with
the men by being a scab.

And this is what Lang and

Light were told at the union meeting on August hth where
they urged the men in the future not to respect the
picket line.
It is for that reason that the mere naked act
of a union officer in doing nothing more than not
crossing the picket line has been held by the Board and
the Courts that have reviewed it as not constituting
sufficient action to justify disparate punishment.

The

only such disparate punishment is not likely to end the
wildcat strike and can only have the forseeable effect

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

of discouraging employees from wanting to serve as union
officers.
QUESTION £

But, Mr. Come —

HE. COMEs

As a matter of fact —

QUESTION.-

Mr. Come.

HR. COMEs

Yes, sir.

QUESTION*

Even the Board agrees that

particular contractual provisions could do it, and all
the management here is contending is that an
©

arbitrator’s construction of a contract should also
permit it.

Now, ought the Board to get where it

concedes that a particular type of contract can produce
the result?

Is it really the province of the Board to

get into the business of interpreting contracts?
HE. COME:

Well, that brings us to the second

issue in this case and — which I now will turn to.
This Court has recognized in the Acme case and
in Carey against Westinghouse and under similar
circumstances in Alexander versus Gardner-Denver which
involved Title VII, that the relationship of an
arbitrator to the courts, which is what the Trilogy
deals with, is quite different from the relationship of
the Board to the arbitral process.

The Board — the

arbitrator's task is to interpret the contract.

And in

interpreting the contract, he can rely on most

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

anything.

He just has to get it somehow from the

essence of the contract.
reasons.

He doesn’t even have to give

And a court will usually sustain him because

he is an expert on the law of the shop.
QUESTION:

Well# Mr. Come# wouldn't the court

also sustain usually the next arbitrator who decided the
issue exactly contrary to the first arbitrator?
MB. COME:

They might.

QUESTION:

Well# I mean one arbitrator isn't

bound by another, is he?
MR. COME:

Well, that is correct, but —

QUESTION:

And a court would probably sustain

MR. COME:

The point# though# is that the

them both.

Board’s job is to interpret the statute, and section
10(a) provides that the Board's power shall not be
affected by any other method of — or agreement or
adjustment.
Now, the Board, of course, has discretion to
defer to an arbitrator's decision.

And it has indicated

in the Spielberg case and subsequently the standards
under which it will defer to an arbitrator's
interpretation of the contract in a situation where
there is a congruence between statutory and contractual
rights.

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

But among the conditions that must be met for

2

such deferral in the Board’s judgment, and the courts

3

have tended to agree with these standards, is that the

4

arbitrator must have decided not only the contract issue

5

but the statutory issue and to have done so in a way

6

that is not repugnant to the Act.

7

Now, one of the fundamental principles in the

8

statute that the Board has enunciated and has been

9

accepted by the courts over many years is that if a

10

statutory right can be waived in a collective bargaining

11

agreement by the parties — and there are some statutory

12

rights, like the right to strike, that can be waived,

13

and there are others that are so fundamental to the

14

employee, like the right to unseat the incumbent

15

bargaining agent that the court was faced with in

16

Magnovox, that cannot be waived, and as this Court

17

indicated in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver the right to be

18

free of racial discrimination — if you do have a right

19

that can be waived, it has to be done by clear and

20

unmistakable language in the collective bargaining

21

agreement, generally.

22

Now, the Board and the Court, Judge Gee, who

23

had a similar problem in South Central Bell, sustained

24

the Board’s view the the kind of contract language that

25

you had here and the kind of arbitrator's decisions of

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

the contract that you had here would not be sufficient
to constitute a clear and unmistakable waiver —
QUESTIONS

Well, before you get to the waiver

issue, I presume you have to have some finding of a
violation of the provision.

Does the Board interpret

the section 8(a)(3) where it terms about discrimination
in regard to higher tenure of employment to mean that
any difference in treatment at all between union
officials and union rank-and-file by management is a
violation of that section and therefore you must get to
the waiver question?
MB. COMEs

Well, I wouldn't go so far as to

say that any disparate treatment, but certainly
disparate discipline for doing the same refusal to work
here would violate 8(a)(3) because it is based upon —
the sole difference is based upon holding union office,
I mean the reason for the enhanced punishment.

And that

has the tendency to discourage engaging in that
protected activity.

So you have to have a

discrimination that is based upon union or protected
activity that would have — that would be inherently
destructive of that right.
QUESTION*

But it is not at all based on bad

motive or on —
MB. COME*

No, it is not based on bad motive.

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

But the court indicated in Erie Resistor and again in
Great Dane that you can have violations of section
8(a)(3) that are not based on bad motive where you can
find that the result of the discrimination is to be
inherently destructive of a section 7 right.

And that

is what is the case here for the reasons that I tried to
indicate earlier would be true of disciplining a union
officer more severely for engaging in an unprotected
strike solely because he is a union officer, without —
if you don't have a contract that would permit such
enhanced discipline.
Now, the question is whether this -- the Board
was reasonable in concluding that this contract, even
with the gloss put on it by the arbitrators, was not
sufficient to show that the parties — and the parties
we're talking about, the union, which is the one that
would be waiving the right of its employees to be free
of such enhanced discipline and for becoming a union
officer, consciously agreed to permit such enhanced
discipline.

Now the —

QUESTION*

But before you get to that question

you have the question of whether the Board was warranted
in finding there was an 8(a)(3) violation at all.
HR. COME*

That is correct, Your Honor.

And I

tried to address that at the outset and to point out

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

that four Courts of Appeals, including most recently th
Fifth Circuit, have agreed with the Board that absent a
contract waiver or a contract clause permitting such
enhanced discipline, there would be a violation of
section 8(a)(3).
QUESTION*

And that is your argument?

HR. COME*

That is our argument.

QUESTION*

That four Courts of Appeals have

agreed with the Board?
MR. COME*

No, it is not -- well, I tried to

explain to Your Honor the reason why the Board's
position is a reasonable one.
QUESTION*

Mr. Come, would you agree that, as

I follow the argument, your opponent says we should
decide the case narrowly just by looking at the
arbitration awards, but if I understand your
presentation, we really have to decide both issues
because you say that we can't evaluate the arbitration
issue without first deciding whether there would be a
discriminatory act by a disparate discipline.

So we

really have to decide both issues, under your view?
MR. COME*

I think that is correct, Your

Honor, because it's because if it is a statutory right
and a statutory violation -QUESTION*

Then you get a higher standard of

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. COME:

That is correct.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. COME;

Now, the arbitrator’s decision —

QUESTION:

Mr. Come, I suppose it's hard to

figure out how you could discipline the union as
distinguished from its leadership in a case like this.
But I suppose you'd make the same arguments, you
couldn't discipline the union either?
MR. COME:

Well, I think --

QUESTION:

If there is some back pay involved

somehow or other, it might —

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE J. COHEN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COHENi
QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
On the point that was being

addressed at the close of your colleague's argument, I
take it to mean that if the contract provided that
greater discipline could be given to officers than
rank-and-file members in a situation like this, that it
could be done.

Is that —

MR. COHEN:

I think that question, Mr. Chief

Justice, goes to the heart of the case here.

The

union's position proceeds on a two-step analysis.
Board's does not.

The

Our —

QUESTION:

But let me —

MR. COHEN:

— our initial position is that

the right to protect employee union officials from
employment discipline for the manner in which they
exercise their office may not be waived.

The Board says

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

the Court need not reach that issue here.
If you put that aside, if the Court disagrees
with us — and I will probably address that after lunch
— if that right may be waived, then the question is
exactly that,

what does the contract provide?

QUESTION;

If the contract — assuming that a

contract provides it, just exactly that, how does it
help the basic argument,that the Board has been making
that this discourages people from becoming union leaders
if there is some way in which union leaders can be
disciplined more than rank-and-file members?
HR. COHEN;

It might indeed have that effect,

but they would have consciously given up that right to
be free from discipline, to have placed that additional
burden on themselves in the bargaining process.
QUESTION;

You don't think the acceptance of

union leadership imposes that obligation, an obligation
to lead in trying to avoid illegal strikes?
HR. COHEN;

Not at all.

We think they — you

begin here with a statutory right to be free from
discrimination.
QUESTION*

When you say "not at all," do you

mean there is no obligation on a union leader to try to
enforce the union's contract obligations?
HR. COHEN;

In this context, we submit that

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

there is no such responsibility inherent in union office
itself.

I agree with you that if the right may be

waived, the contract may spell out those rights and
responsibilities.
And by way of contrast and by way of example,
the Fifth Circuit in its South Central Bell decision
looked to an earlier Third Circuit decision in Gould
where the parties very specifically provided if there is
a work stoppage, the union official shall do this, this,
this, and this.

They said that is an assumption of

responsibilities.
On the other end of the spectrum, they said,
lies Metropolitan Edison where you have nothing more
than a general or neutral no-strike clause; therefore,
the contract imposes no such responsibilities.
QUESTION;

But did I understand you, Mr.

Cohen, to say that you are going to argue perhaps after
lunch that such a clause is in any event not enforceable?
MR. COHENs

That is the union — is not the

statutory right of the union official —
QUESTION;

No, I —

MR. COHEN;
QUESTION;

May not be waived —
— if you have a clause in the

contract that said you may impose on union leaders
greater discipline, are you going to argue that that is

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may continue, Mr.

5

MR. COHEN;

6

time I would like to make several points which arose

7

this morning.
First the company contends that affirmance of

the decision below would undermine the Steelworkers

13

different from the contractual issues which arbitrators

I submit that the Board’s right to review

resolve under the Trilogy, and second, the Board's
15

authority to make those determinations has been

16

expressly upheld in what I will call a quartet of later

17

cases; specifically, CSC Plywood, Acme, Strong, and

18

Gardner-Denver.

19

Mr. Chief Justice, in my remaining

After a thoroughgoing discussion of that issue

20

in Acme, the Court had this sentence which I think sums

21

up my point perfectly;

22

decisions as automatically requiring the Board in this

23

case to defer to the primary determination of an

24

arbitrator is to overlook important distinction between

25

those cases and this one.

"To view the Steelworkers

1

Now, I think it is important to recall that a

2

person who serves as an employee and a union official

3

has two sets of duties.

4

has obligations to the employer.

5

he has duties running only to the union and the union

6

members — unless, of course, he waives the right as an

7

employee to be free of employer discipline for the

8

manner in which he exercises his official functions in

9

the union.

10
11

As an employee, certainly he

does constitute an adeguate waiver.
That question had its genesis in Kastro

15

unmistakable waiver.

17

Since then the circuit courts and

18

imposes specific duties on union officials.

The general

19

or neutral no-strike clause is not sufficient.

20

wouldn't suffice under Mastro, and both the D.C. Circuit

21

and Fifth Circuit have held it inadequate in these

22

circumstnces.

23

awards are not sufficient because they did not even

24

purport to decide any statutory issues. And as Justice

25

O'Connor pointed out, they really didn't deal with any

2

In fact, if everything else the company said

3

were correct, its argument would still fail, we believe,

4

because of the language of section 9.2 paragraph 4 in

5

the agreement, which is the arbitration provision, which

6

states that arbitration decisions shall be "binding for

the term of this agreement."

And finally the -- well, I made that point
already.

4

The other point I would like to make is that

5

unions and employers alike agree about the

destructiveness of wildcat strikes.

on the question of whether disparate discipline of union

officials helps that problem or exacerbates it.

think it exacerbates it.

Although I differ in some respects from some

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD F. SILE0, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

24
25

MR. SILE0:

First of all, with respect to the

facts in this case, I think it important to note that

►

1

contrary to the Heist situation, which was quoted or

2

referred to by Hr. Cohen, the union officers in this
case made no effort whatsoever during the strike to be

of any help.

5

refused to cross the picket line in spite of being told

6

to do so repeatedly, in spite of being toll that they

7

would be in big trouble.

And at one point union officer Lang
contemptuously said, listen, if we cross this picket

if their primary concern was their internal union

7

important aspect of their responsibility.

9

As far as the analysis that was suggested by

10

Justice Rehnguist, which was to the effect that we first

11

have to decide whether there has been a violation, we

12

decided there has been a violation of section 8(a)(3) if

responsibility to lead.

This Coart recognized those leadership
qualities in the Weingarten case, an entirely different
— in an entirely different context, but where you
encouraged that if the rank-and-file employee wants a
union officer or a steward present, he should have that
steward present.
Why should we presume that the union officer
or the steward at the picket line is going to be so
ineffectual?

There is no reason for us to presume that

from a factual standpoint at all.
QUESTION;

So we say —

Do you want the stewards to go out

and break up the picket line?
MR. SILEO;
QUESTION;

I beg your pardon?
Do you want the stewards to break

up the picket line?
MR. SILE0;

Just — in this situation, Justic

Marshall, we had the picket line already established.
That picket line was another union’s picket line.
Okay.

The union officers' only effort was to remove

that picket line.

We say that we didn't hire them as

mediators, thank you.

If anything, by attempting to

remove the picket line, they were rubberstamping that
they had no duty to cross it.
Now, if what you mean is in a context where
the principal union —

QUESTION;

I think you and I know what I mean.

2

HP . SILEO:

Well, okay.

If what we mean is

3

given a situation where the union that is involved sets

4

up a picket line, do the union officers have a duty to

5

break up the picket line?

6

another union.

7

duty not to participate in that picket line; and number

8

two, to make clear to the other employees that they

9

shouldn't participate in that picket line.

11

Do you think they must cross the

line?

Yes.

It's our position that

they must cross the line.
QUESTION*

14

That is, that they must, in your

15

view, say this line is — does not really exist as a

16

matter of law because it's an illegal line, it is not a

17

picket line under labor law?

HR. SILE0:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SILEO:

25

QUESTION:

— that's the violation.
In this context —
Even though the picket line itself

is a perfectly lawful labor activity.

2

MR. SILEO*

3

QUESTION s

4

MR. SILEO*

5

Right.
Yes.
Because in this context

there had

been an arbitration decision, not either of the two that

7

decision where it had been held that the refusal to

8

cross a picket line was unlawful.

9
10
11
12

QUESTION*

What kind of a line do we have

here, now just to get that straight?
MR. SILEO;

We have a stranger picket line.

We have another union that established, a picket line.

13

QUESTION;

It was a legalline, though.

14

MR. SILEO;

It was a legal, insofar as we are

15
16
17
18

concerned, we can treat it as if it were legal.
QUESTION;

But it was a line that if they

didn't cross, it was in breach of contract.
MR. SILEO;

That's correct.

That's correct.

19

That's clearly the case.

20

**“ that's one reason why we say similarly situated,

21

because it was inherent in their position.

22

Now, that’s the reason why we

The other reason why we say that the union

23

officers were not similarly situated is, very simply,

24

because by contract the Board and five circuits now hold

25

that you can impose greater duties on union officers, or

QUESTIONS

Yes, I know, but the parties are

also operating under the federal law, and if a second

arbitrator can disregard the first and interpret the

contract as not waiving, or whatever you want to call

it, waiving the rights of union officers, why shouldn't

16

the National Labor Relations Board be able to do that?

17

MR. SILEO*

Well, Justice White, it is my

18

position, it is our position, that the party — if a

second arbitrator reverses the first arbitrator, it was

his judgment that was bargained for by the parties.
