ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE M. COHEN, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. COHEN;
the Court.

11
12

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

In 1959 the Congress amended the National
Labor Relations Act.

They had two objectives.

One

3

fundamental purpose was to strike from the prohibitions

4

against secondary boycotts, close loopholes it had

5

developed under the prior act, to preclude, as this

6

Court indicated in Tree Fruits, coercion whether by

7

picketing or otherwise, of a secondary employer to force

8

him

9

with whom a union had a labor dispute.

20

to cease doing business with the primary employer

At the same time, however, Congress also

2

sought to ensure that unions could appeal to the public

22

for support.

23

about a labor dispute, and that they could continue to

24

place pressure not only on a primary employer, but on

25

those secondary employers who chose to intertwine their

fate, who had a unity of interest with the primary on

2

the chain of production.

3

The result as it was in many other labor parts

4

-- portions of the labor law -- was a compromise.

5

picketing was allowed, some picketing was prohibited.

6

Some coersion was allowed, some collusion was

7

prohibited.

8

was permitted, and some handbilling and other publicity

9

was prohibited.

11

Some

And some handbilling and other publicity

This was spelled out in the publicity

proviso, the Section 8(b)(4).

must be a producer/distributor relationship between the

18

primary and the secondary.

19

and notwithstanding that the union’s conduct is

20

coercive, it’s protected by the proviso.

21

First, the handbilling cannot

If any of those conditions are not met,

22

however, and the prohibitions of Section 8(b)(4) would

23

otherwise be applicable, then there's an unlawful

24

secondary boycott.

25

The issue in this case is whether an integral

4

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 <202) 828-9300

1

component of that compromise, a carefully established

2

congressional balance, the producer/distributor

3

relationship of the proviso is to be respected, and if

4

it is respected, whether that deference is compatible

5

with the First Amendment.

6

The facts of this case are generally

7

stipulated and not in dispute and they're relatively

8

simple.

9

the name of High, who is engaged to build a department

10

We here have a company, a general contractor by

store for a retailer by the name of Wilson.

11

The store is to be built as an addition to an

12

existing shopping center that’s already in operation,

13

and it's owned by the Petitioner, DeBartolo.

14

has an 85 tenant stores.

15

retailers. Wards, Penneys, Belks, and Wilson's is going

16

to be the fourth.

The center

It has two or three major

The union does not have any dispute with any

17
18

of those tenants, does not have any dispute with

19

DeBartolo.

20

not paying union standard wages and benefits.

21

to pressure High, the union passes out handbills at all

22

the entrances to the center and at various entrances to

23

some of the tenant stores.

24
25

Its dispute is with High, because High is
In order

The handbills are not directed at High's.
They're not directed at Wilson's.

They're not confined

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

to informing the public about the dispute the union has

2

with High.

3

boycott all the stores at the center, in big bold

4

capital letters at the top of the handbill which is at

5

page 84, the Joint Appendix.

6

East Lake Square Mall.

Instead, what they ask is that the consumers

It says, don't shop at

The handbill specifically asks the customers

7

8

not to patronize the tenant stores.

9

Court below held that that handbill was protected by the

The board in the

10

proviso, that even though it was otherwise a

11

impermissible attempt to coerce secondaries, the tenant

12

stores, it fell within the producer/distributor language

13

of the proviso.
The reasoning was that the product that was

14
15

produced by High, the Wilson store, was not only being

16

distribute! by Wilson, it was being distributed by all

17

the other tenant stores that were part of the shopping

18

cen ter.

19

Now we don’t dispute here and have never

20

disputed that Wilson's was distributing a product

21

produced by High.

22

the other cases the board has decided since Servette —

23

that was a distribution, the union could have properly

24

passed out its handbill urging customers not to

25

patronize Wilson’s.

But under Servette that's a -- and

They could of course have picketed

High.

2

could have engaged in any kind of non-coerrive activity

3

they wanted, to publicize their dispute because then you

4

would not have been under section 8(b)(4) at all.

5

disagreement is with the conclusion that the union could

6

coercively handbill the tenant stores.

That would have been primary picketing.

What is coercively handbilling?
Coercively handbilling is saying

do not patronize this store.

QUESTION:

13

HR. COHEN:

Who is —
Do not shop —
Who is it coercing?
It's coercing the tenant stores to

14

force them to stop doing business, presumably, or put

15

pressures somehow on Wilson's and through Wilson's on

16

High.

The object is to —
QUESTION:

17

Why don’t they, instead of using

18

that language, they had carefully explained everything

19

that was going on?
SR. COHEN:

20

We would have had no dispute with

21

the handbill and it wouldn’t have fallen under section

22

8(b)(4).

23

QUESTION:

Why — their bottom line would have

24

been, please do not — please do not patronize this

25

shopping center.

MR. COHEN:

No.

The difference is when you

inflict economic injury.

3

QUESTION!

Well, their bottom line is still --

4

their aim is to get people out of the shopping center.

5

And they just don't — they just explain why.

8

MR. COHEN:

The distinction that's been drawn

7

for the statute — the statute uses the word coerce,

8

restraint and threaten, section 8(b)(4).

9

The way those terms have been defined, and I

10

think it's explained at footnote 11 in Servette, is

11

where you're making a request, where you're asking

12

somebody voluntarily to do something.

13

dipute.

14

disseminating information about its dispute, then that

15

wouldn't have been coercive.

16

where you say, do not patronize, as in every Board case

17

— they are cited at note 8 of our principal brief, note

18

14 of our reply brief -- every case, do not patronize

19

language has been considered coersive.

20

the proviso because now you're putting economic pressure

21

on.

22

that's all the union was saying, then that would be

23

permissibly disseminating --

2

MR. COHEN:

It's the do not shop language that

3

then becomes coersive under the act, because now there's

4

economic pressure being put on the secondary.

that's, I don't think, disputed by any of the parties in

MR. COHEN;

The victims are the tenant stores

QUESTION:

15

MR. COHEN:

Pardon me, the tenant stores?
The victims ace the tenant stores

16

who are losing patronage because of a dispute that they

have nothing to do with whatsoever.

18

patronage because of customers who get the handbill and

19

do not shop at the tenant stores, therefore, cost them

business.

They are losing

QUESTION:

Normally when you coerce someone --

23

if you're coercing the tenant store, you're trying to

get the tenant store to do something.

MR. COHEN:

That's right.

MR. COHEN;

They forbid it if it’s coercion.
They forbid it if it’s coercion -Now, how can it be coercion if you

18

put the pressure on somebody who’s totally unable to do

19

anything relevant to the controversy?

20

MR. COHEN;

Because the effect is the same.

21

The effect is that we lose — we lose

22

customers.

We are being — we are being coerced even

23

though we can’t do anything about the coercion.

that’s giving rise to the union pressure.

when Congress drew this producer/distributor language --

QUESTION;

MR. COHEN;

If it isn’t coercion, it doesn’t

fall under section 8(b)(4).

7

QUESTION;

8

SR. COHEN;

9

Let me put it this way, can you

make your argument without using the word coercion?

5

6

That’s why

I see.
And if it doesn't fall under

section 8(b)(4) we wouldn’t be here.

10

QUESTION;

But I --

But I agree with Justice Stevens,

11

you’re coerced -- if you're coerced, you're coerced for

the purpose of making you do something.

way you can be coerced.

That’s the only

14

MR. COHEN;

15

Now, the board says we’re being coerced

That’s right.

16

because we can do something.

17

Wilson’s, please get rid of High, and therefore, end the

18

labor problems.

19

the labor board's position is that we can solve the

20

problem.

21

within the producer/distributor language.

22

We can go ahead and tell

The union — I mean — the union and

QUESTION;

So both of you agree that coerce

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. COHEN;

14

QUESTION;

All right,

I see —

And that's -- that's what we -Is it arguable that the tenant

15

stores could put pressure on the mall owner to include

16

contractural requirements that any tenant store that's

17

building has to pay union wages or something?

18

MR. COHEN;

Well, it's conceivable that

19

tenants might say, we are losing business, and go to

20

DeBartolo, the owner, and ask DeBartolo then to go to

21

Wilson’s.

22

But we’re many, many stages down the chain and all

23

that's speculative.

24
25

And then ask Wilson's in turn to go to High.

It was stipulated in the record, here, that
neither DeBartolo nor the tenants had any power

whatsoever to get ri d of Wilson’s and to get rid of

High, that that was solely Wilson’s decision.

was the stipulation of fact —

You argue for some unity of

interest theory.

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
But that isn't spelled out or

8

defined.

9

or what you really have in mind.

10

And that

And I don’t know exactly how that would apply

MR. COHEN:

Let me answer it this way.

The

11

reason we use the unity of interest test is because that

12

was the term that was referred to in the Congressional

13

debates arising out of the Goldfinger case.

14

term that was referred to by the contemporary

15

commentators.

16

accepted definition at the time.

17

It was the

It was a term that Servette said was the

What that test means is that a union follow

18

through the chain of distribution to anyone in that

19

chain who adds to the value of the product, and put

20

pressure on anyone on that chain because they are

21

enhancing the value of what the union is doing — I

22

mean, what the primary is doing.

23

If somebody adds the value in the terms of the

24

advertising, if somebody adds value in the terms of

25

being a wholesaler like in Servette, they are helping

1

the distribution of the product which the union has its

2

dispute with.

3

and is able under the statute to handbill any of those

4

people, and advise the public that they are assisting

5

the practices which the union deems to be unfair.

6
7

10

So the union follows through the product

QUESTION*

Who would that leave out?

Give me

some example as to -HR. COHEN*

That would leave out, in this

case, the tenants who are not -QUESTION*

Okay.

But how about other

11

examples, because if the Court were to adopt such a

12

test, we'd have to be concerned about other examples.

13

What if the construction were up in New York City at a

14

Bloomingdale's store, could you handbill the

15

Bloomingdale's store in Washington?

16

MR. COHEN*

According to the Board -- one of

17

the Board decisions is since there's no situs

18

requirement in the statute, yes, you could.

19

QUESTION;

20

MR . COHEN*

And under your test?
Under our test, you could.

Our

21

test goes to the nature of where you are in the chain of

22

production.

23

mean something.

24

25

to find what that means, we submit that that means any

— as the Board defined it, in the Lohman case and has

2

applied it in every case up to Pet and this case --if

3

you add something to the value of the product, tangible

4

or intangibly, in the form of labor, and that labor can

5

take capital, it can take enterprise, it can take

6

service.

7

way then you are on the chain of production and you are

8

part of the unity of interest and you fall within the

9

producer/distributor, and the union could handbill here.

10

If you enhance the value of the product in any

QUESTION;

Well, the argument of the Board is

11

that every major tenant in the mall adds value in effect

12

to every other tenant because you're bringing more

13

people into the mall.

15

MR. COHEN*

That’s where the Board is wrong.

And that’s where we disagree with the board.

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. COHENs

Why?
Because tenants of a shopping

The value is being enhanced not only of the

6

tenants in the store -- if you look at the diagram of

7

the shopping center that's in the Joint Appendix, you'll

8

see there's a circle of restaurants. Burger King's and

9

Sambo's and others around the Wilson store.

Obviously

10

they're all going to be better off if there's a

11

functioning Wilson's just like all the tenants are.

12

They are going to have gotten more customers, too.

13

no one's ever claimed that they are part of some joint

14

merchandising venture which is what the Board says the

15

shopping center is.

16

But

One tenant has no control and no relationship

with another tenant other than the fact that they're

going to be embroiled in the labor disputes of the High

QUESTION;

What do you say the handbilling was

aimed at?

3

MR. COHEN;

The handbilling was aimed here to

4

try to cause the tenant stores to lose customers in the

5

hope that somehow that would put pressure on High who

6

was the primary.

7

what the union believed to be, that High’s unfair

8

practice is in not paying union standard wages and

9

benefits.

10

And by putting pressure on High, and

When we look at the -- at what the

11

producer/distributor language is to mean, it — we have

12

referred in our brief at various points to the words,

13

what those words mean in other labor laws, to what they

14

mean elsewhere in the act, to what they were referred to

15

by members of Congress, and, finally, to what the Board

16

itself sail was the unity of interest standard.

17

And in Servette that was the exact test that

18

it proposed to this Court.

19

should be able to follow the product, they should not be

20

able to spread a labor dispute more widely through the

21

community by putting pressure upon any firm that had any

22

form of business relations with the firm engaged in the

23

labor dispute.

The First Amendment argument was

I'm still not satisfied as to why

the First Amendment issue is in this case.

3

we’re not reviewing the Pet case here, are we?

4

HR. COHEN;

That’s correct.

So why — I don't see how the First

13

QUESTION:

The First Amendment is not in the

case, obviously, unless the Court feels there is a need

to address that issue as one of the arguments the Eoard

Perhaps I should ask my questions

HR. COHEN:

Perhaps, then, maybe I should

MR. COHEN:

And the entire basis for

That's correct.

And I think

6

there's a substantial government interest in regulating

that content because it's part of the delicate balance

8

that Congress drew between allowing a union to

And as part of that delicate balance that

can be more coercive, what Congress addressed was the

And why — not degrees of coercion -- and as long as it

whether it was causing a secondary work stoppage or was

I’d like to say that --

QUESTION;

14

And under your theory even an ad in

the newspaper would be invalid?

15

MR. COHEN;

The -- Congress drew a line

16

between two types of activity, picketing which only can

17

take place at a primary site, publicity other than

18

picketing which can take place at any place and any form

19

if three tests are met.

20

whether it was a newspaper ad or a letter, it would be

21

condemned.

22

whether it was a newspaper ad or a letter, it would be

condemned, and if there's no producer/distributor

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. COMEs

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court.
The union here had a primary dispute with High

8
9

Mr. Come.

Construction Company over the payment of allegedly

10

substandard wages and fringe benefits to construction

11

employees.

12

\
When Wilson’s contracted with High to build

13

its store at the East Lake Mall in Tampa owned by

14

petitioner DeBartolo, the union passed out handbills at

15

the mall appealing to the public not to shop at the

16

Mall.

17

Joint Appendix.

18

what the handbills pointed out was that the Wilson's

19

department store was under construction on these

20

premises and was being built by contractors who had paid

21

substandard wages and fringe benefits.

The handbills are set out at page 84-A of the
I won't read it all, but, in essence,

22

It explained that in the past, the mall’s

23

owner, DeBartolo, had insured that the mall and its

24

stores were built by contractors who did pay fair wages

25

and fringe benefits, and that the mall owner had

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

departed from that requirement in the lease that it gave

2

to Wilson 's .

3

And the handbill ended up by asking the public

4

in view of the fact that Wilson's was being built with

5

allegedly unfair work standards, not to patronize the

6

stores in the mall until the mall's owner publicly

7

promises that all construction at the mall will be done

8

using contractors who pay their employees fair wages and

9

fringe benefits.

And added that, however, if you must

10

enter the mall to do business, please express to the

11

store managers your concern over substandard wages and

12

your support of our efforts.

13

Now the Board did not decide whether this

14

handbilling constituted restraint and coercion within

15

the meaning of the operative part of 8(b)(4)ii(b)

16

because it found that it was protected by the publicity

17

proviso to the section which excludes publicity other

18

than picketing for the purpose of fruitfully advising

19

the public that a product or products are produced by an

20

employer with whom a labor organization has a primary

21

dispute and are distributed by another employer as long

22

as such publicity does not have an effect of stopping

23

deliveries, and there were no such work stoppages here.

24
25

Now in Servette, decided 19 years ago, this
Court, noting that the publicity proviso was the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

outgrowth of a profound Senate concern that the union’s

2

freedom to appeal to the public for support be

3

adequately safeguarded, rejected a narrow reading of the

4

producer/distributor language and sustained the Board's

5

holding in Lohman that the terms as used in the proviso

6

cannot be applied in a narrow literal manner but must be

7

applied in a manner so as to effectuate Congress's

8

concern in putting in the proviso which was, as I will

9

outline in a moment, a concern that a ban on such

10

publicity would present a First Amendment problem as

11

Congress understood the cases under the First Amendment

12

and the labor area in 1959.

13

Now we submit that the Board's interpretation

14

of the proviso in this case is faithful to the

15

principles of Servette and to the legislative intent.
Now let me just briefly outline what was

16
17

before Congress in 1959.

As the Court may recall, the

18

Landrum-Griffin bill passed by the House which embodied

19

the Eisenhower Administration's proposals as to

20

secondary boycotts was chiefly concerned with closing

21

three loopholes that were perceived in 8(b)(4) as it

22

then existed.

23

secondary employer by a threat of labor trouble was not

24

covered.

Appeals to individual employees were not

25

covered.

Nor was inducement of employees of

Direct inducement of a supervisor or

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

non-statutory employers.

2

There was no one in the Congress that thought

3

that the amendments that were proposed would cover

4

consumer boycotts until late in the debates on the

5

bill.

6

a radio address in which he pointed out that any new

7

reform legislation should include a provision that

8

banned consumer picketing by a union at a retail

9

a stablishment.

10

In August of

'59, President Eisenhower delivered

On August 20, following the appointment of the

11

House and the Senate conferees to work out a compromise

12

on two versions of the proposed legislation. Senator

13

Kennedy, who was to preside at the conference and

14

Representative Thompson, who was one of the conferees,

15

issued an analysis of the Landrum-Griffin bill which had

16

by then passed the House, and criticized it in two

17

respects that ara relevant to this case.

18

The first was that the House bill would

19

prevent the union that had a dispute with an employer

20

such as Coors Beer from picketing a restaurant with

21

signs asking the public not to buy the product.

22

second concern was that the prohibition of the House

23

bill reach not only picketing, but leaflets, radio

24

broadcasts, and newspaper advertisements, thereby

25

interfering with freedom of speech.

And the

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

How, as this Court held in Tree Fruits, the

2

first concern that picketing that just followed the

3

struck product would be prohibited by the

4

Landrum-Griffin bill was taken care of when they, the

5

conferees, agreed that that would not come even within

6

the restrainst and coerce language in 8(b)(4)ii at all.

7

That the only picketing that would be covered would be

8

picketing that cut off the neutrals* total business.

9

And as this Court later held in Safco, in some

10

circumstances where his business was only one product

11

even following that product by picketing would be --

12

13

QUESTION;

What do you say is the product

here, now, Mr. Come.

14

MR. COME;

Well the product is the Wilson's

15

store.

16

physical product in the normal sense, but on the other

17

hand as the Court pointed out in Servette there was no

18

intention that Congress intended the proviso to be any

19

narrower than the prohibition to which it was attached.

20

And unless you interpret product so that it can include

21

things other than physical products, whole industries

22

would be not included within the scope of the proviso.

23
24
25

Even the petitioner concedes that.

QUESTION;

It is not a

So the store is the product

produced by the construction company?
MR. COME;

That is correct.

And the Board

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

found, and we submit reasonably so on this record, that

2

in view of the interrelationships between the tenants at

3

the mall and Wilson's that were created by the lease

4

arrangements that the DeBartolo set up here, that in an

5

economic sense all of the tenants — were, together with

6

Wilson's, distributing the fruits of Highs* labor in the

7

Wilson's store.

8
9

10

QUESTION;

Does that strike you as a very

faithful application of the language of the proviso?
NR. COME;

It does, Your Honor, when it is

11

recognized that what Congress was seeking to accomplish

12

by the proviso.

13

And anything that —

QUESTION;

I would think we would know what

14

Congress was seeking to accomplish by the proviso by the

15

language it chose in enacting a proviso.

16

MR. COME;

The language is certainly the

17

starting point, however, but this Court has recognized,

18

and most particularly, in Servette, that —

19

20
21

QUESTION;
wholesaler/retailer.
MR. COME;

Well that was a
That was nothing like this case.
But nonetheless the argument was

22

that producer meant only the manufacturer, and the

23

principle that sustained a broader interpretation, that

24

is, the Board's Lehman decision which was being reviewed

25

in Servette in which the Board first enunciated the

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

principle here, that a producer is, in order to

2

effectuate the purpose of the proviso, is anyone who

3

adds value to a product in an economic sense.

4

Now in -- as I say, even petitioner here

5

concedes, or acknowledges, that the Wilson's store here

6

is a product that was created by High's and is being

7

distributed by Wilson’s.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

I didn't know he — he concedes

this being distributed by Wilson’s?

He doesn't concede

this as being distributed by the other retailers in the

11

13

NR. COME:

He does not concede it’s what -- by

the other retailers, but —

14

QUESTION:

You have to -- you have to get over

15

that hurtle, don't you?

16

They thought it was being distributed by all the

17

retailers.

18

NR. COME:

And the Board certainly did.

That is correct.

And I've

19

attempted to explain why the Board did so in this case

20

in order to give effect to the Congressional intention

21

in adopting the proviso.

22

The reason that the proviso was put in there,

23

again returning to Senator Kennedy, was as he explained,

24

"we were not able to persuade the House conferees to

25

permit picketing in front of that secondary shop but we

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-8300

1

were able to persuade them to agree that the union shall

2

be free to conduct informational activity short of

3

picketing".

4

handbills at the shop and place advertisements in

5

newspapers and make announcements over the radio and can

6

carry on all publicity short of having ambulatory

7

picketing in front of a secondary site.

8
9

In other words, the union can hand out

Now as I indicated, shortly after the '59
amendments were enacted, and for more than two decades

10

since, the Board has applied the proviso in the light

11

cast by this legislative history and its basic purpose.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Come, in your view, what is

13

important in interpreting the language of in some manner

14

distributed.

15

employer to bring economic leverage to bear on the labor

16

dispute or what?

17

the line?

18

Is it the ability of the secondary

What's the key?

MR. COME:

Where would you draw

Well I think the — I think the key

19

is whether you have a person that is contributing

20

something of value to a product which in turn is

21

distributed in an economic sense by the persons who are

22

being handbilled.

23

Now on the facts of this case, the Board found

24

such a relationship in the fact that the petitioner,

25

DeBartolo, here is the owner of the land on which High,

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

I mean, how do we know there's

You say they didn't address this —
MR. COME;

Your Honor.

Well, this was a stipulated record,

There are no facts other than the

here but the handing out of these handbills which

12

described the facts of the labor dispute and added,

15

The stipulation shows that nothing went on

Now it is well established in the decisions of

this Court, and indeed the Court emphasized that, in

opinion by Justice Rutledge in Thomas against Collins

And so therefore, the mere fact that the union

Exactly.

And if that's a good

20

MR. COME;

Well, the other way of avoiding the

21

Constitution is to interpret — is to sustain the

22

Board's intrepretation of the proviso as taking this

23

kind — as saving this sort of activity from the ban of

24

8(b)(4)(b).

25

followed —

This is the way the loop that the Board has

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

QUESTION;

But it strikes me, Nr. Come, that

2

your First Amendment argument that you made a moment ago

3

was framed in terms of the difference between coercion

4

and non-coercion which really goes to the coercive

5

section of the proviso and not to the producer section.

6

MR. COME:

That may be, if legislation were

7

drafted in an ideal sort of way, as Tour Honor I'm sure

8

is aware is not the case.

9

The fact of the matter is that when it became

10

apparent that picketing, at least certain forms of

11

consumer picketing, were covered by the restraint and

12

coercion part of 8(b)(4)(b), the Senate conferees

13

thought that out of an abundance of caution it was

14

necessary to add the proviso to make doubly sure that

15

this sort of publicity short of picketing would not be a

18

violation of 8(b)(4)(b).

17

has read the legislative history and has thus

18

interpreted the proviso.

And that is the way the Board

So the point that I want to get at is, and I'm

19

20

not suggesting that the Court reject the Board's

21

interpretation of the statute, all I’m suggesting is

22

that unless there's a clear indication that Congress

23

intended to cover this type of publicity, and we submit

24

that, if anything, there's a clear indication that it

25

did not.

Prudential considerations that this Court has

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

long followed would dictate that it should avoid the —

2

the difficult constitutional problem that would be

3

presented by sustaining the Board's interpretation of

4

the statute.

5

QUESTION;

Well, we still have to find -- we

6

still have to agree that there's some — some merit at

7

least in the holding that DeBartolo and all the other

8

stores were distributing a product of an employer with

9

whom the union had a dispute.

And you do it on the

10

basis that -- the theory that a rising tide raises all

11

the boats I guess, the — everybody helps everybody else

12

in this store — in this shopping center.

13

HR. COME;

At least in the particular type of

14

relationship that you had at this mall, that this is

15

different from the stores on a block, that the petitioner

16

is positing.

17

leasing arrangements and a joining together for mutual

18

benefit that you have here where the —

19

You do not have the kind of interlocking

QUESTION;

So even if -- even if there are

20

three competing department stores, all nosed in nose to

picket the mall on the grounds that they’re all feeding

off of one another.

MR. COME;

That is correct.

Which, if it were

16

prohibited, I submit, would present a substantial

17

constitutional question because what the Court would

18

have to decide is whether the First Amendment permits a

19

constitutional prohibition directed solely to a message

20

that is communicated to members of the public that

21

elicits no unlawful response on their part because

there's nothing unlawful about asking consumers to
