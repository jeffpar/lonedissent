ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. BARRETT PRETTYMAN, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF NEVADA

8
9

MR. PRETTYMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, I represent the state of Nevada, and I

10

will be followed by Mr. Girard, representing the

11

Truckee-Carson Irrigation District, or TCID.

12

This is a preclusion case.

The basic issue is

13

to what extent the United States and the Paiute Tribe of

14

Indians are barred by res judicata or collateral

15

estoppel from seeking more water from the Truckee River

16

in Nevada for the Indians'

reservation.

17

We say that they are completely barred by

18

virtue of the final decree that was rendered by the

19

Federal District Court in Nevada in the so-called Orr

20

Ditch case some 40 years ago.

21

piecemeal, interlocutory, or open-ended proceeding.

22

both of the courts below found, this was a

23

comprehensive, all-inclusive, quiet title water

24

adjudication.

25

Now,

Orr Ditch was no
As

It was begun in 1913, with the United States

appearing on behalf of both the tribe, which had been

2

set aside -- rather, the reservation, which had been set

3

aside in 1859, and also the Newlands Project, which is a

4

reclamation project authorized by Congress in 1902.
Now, Winters had been decided five years

5

6

before this Orr Ditch case was begun, in 1908, so that

7

for the reservation, the United States was seeking water

8

for the primary purpose of the reservation which it

9

deemed to be to convert the Indians from their nomadic

10

habits into husbandry and agriculture, and therefore to

11

give them water for irrigation.
For Newlands, the United States sought enough

12
13

water to irrigate the project.

14

some 13 years, until a temporary restraining order was

15

entered in 1926 by the court after a Special Waster had

16

heard evidence, and the TRO acted as a kind of a trial

17

balloon.

18

Would the TRO work?

The case proceeded for

Was it feasible?

And this test period lasted for 18 years,

19

until finally, in

1944, a final decree was entered which

20

established the guantification for every claimant to

21

this river.

22

prohibited every claimant from ever again seeking water

23

of the Truckee.

It applied then and for the future.

It

It contained no reopening provisions.

24

As for the Indians, the Court of Appeals said

25

the government placed in issue the reservation cause of

action
And now what do we find?

2

Tventy-nine years

3

later, the government brought this action seeking

4

additional water on behalf of the tribe.

5

Circuit made two holdings.

6

res judicata prevented this suit insofar as the Orr

7

Ditch defendants were concerned.

8

if the United States should not have represented both

9

the reservation and the project, which the Ninth Circuit

The Ninth

First of all, it held that

In other words, even

10

did not decide, the Orr Ditch defendants were not aware

11

of any impropriety, and consequently res judicata

12

applied .

13
14

We believe that that ruling is clearly
correct.

The Orr Ditch defendants were

QUESTION :

18

Who were the Orr Ditch defendants?

Wholly — who had pre-existing

rights?
NR. PRETTYNANs

That's correct, of varying

p riorities.
QUESTION;

Wholly aside from those who would

get water from the Newlands?

QUESTION;

I'm sorry.

Wholly aside from those who would

1

get water from the Newlands.
MR. PRETTYMAN4

2

Yes, these claimants, Your

3

Honor, I think eight of them actually proceeded the

4

reservation claims, and most of them came between then

5

and 1902, and some came after 1902.

6

QUESTIONi

7

MR. PRETTYMANi

8

The court also made a seco nd ruling, however ,

9

Yes.

All right.
Right.

and this was two to one, with Judge Schroed er

10

dissenting , namely, that the United States could take

11

water for the tribe from the Newland s Project farmers

12

because in Orr Ditch, the Ninth Circuit thought that

13

there was no adversity under the pleadings insofar as

14

the Newlands farmers were concerned.
Now, the first point I would like to make, and

15
16

incidentally, we obviously regard that ruling as an

17

error.

18

The first point is that there was nothing improper about

19

the government representation in Orr Ditch.

20

types of case, as this Court is well aware, the

21

government often has to represent diverse interests.

22

may be reservations.

23

national forests, naval bases, and so forth.

24

Court said as much last month in Arizona versus

25

California, when it approved Heckman.

We think res judicata applies across the board.

In these

It may be reclamation projects,

Heckman, incidentally, had been decided only
one year before Orr Ditch began.
There was certainly nothing improper perceived

4

at the time of Orr Ditch by the government's

5

representation.

6

properly, and very actively, on behalf of both the

7

project and on behalf of the reservation.

8
9

It thought that it was proceeding quite

Moreover, the government’s good faith
representation is shown by two factors here.

First of

10

all, between the TRQ and the final decree, the

11

government actually obtained more water for the Indians

12

than had been prescribed in the TRO.

13

amount that the Indians were going to get.

14

They increased the

And secondly, in the Walker River case. Walker

15

River Reservation having been established by the same

16

documents -- the same Indians, as a matter of fact, were

17

involved — there was no project, no competing project,

18

and the government still did not seek a fishery right in

19

the Walker River case.

because of any conflict in our case.

So,

obviously, it was not acting

QUESTIONS

2

HP. PRETTYMAN;

3

-- not for the fishery rights.
That’s correct.

No discrete

fishery right was sought in Orr Ditch.
QUESTION!

4

And you challenge the District

5

Court's findings that the tribe's fishery right was not

6

actually litigate! in Orr Ditch?
HR. PRETTYMANi

7

Not at all.

We concede that a

8

discrete fishery right was not sought as part of the

9

decree in Orr Ditch.

Now, the reason I use the word

10

"discrete" is that the United States sought a full

11

Winters right for the reservation, but it was seeking it

12

primarily for irrigation, which it perceived to be the

13

primary purpose of the reservation.

14

So, it also -- domestic water and a small

15

amount of water for fishery undoubtedly was thought

16

about, but you have to understand, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

17

that unlike today, where the government is seeking a

18

tremendous amount of water to maintain the level of the

19

lake, back in Orr Ditch, when they were thinking about a

20

fishery right, they were thinking about a very small

21

amount of water simply to allow the fish to get upstream

22

to spawn.

23

QUESTION;

24

70 feet, hasn’t it?

25

Of course, the lake has gone down

MR. PRETTYKAN;

Well, that is very

1

interesting, Mr. Justice.

2

dramatically in the forties and fifties, but it has been

3

stabilized since. You will find a finding by the

4

District Court, and the Court of Appeals seems to agree,

5

that the lake has been stabilized, and our studies show

6

that as a matter of fact, it has been stabilized since

7

1960, and on top of that, we have $32 million spent by

8

the government to add to the fishery, and of course the

9

tribe also gained $8 million in the — before the

10

Indians Claim Commission because of their lost right.

The lake went down rather

Well —

-- with the fishery rights, except

on your broad approach.
MR. PRETTYMAN:

16

Well, the Indians Claim

17

Commission decision is a rather interesting one, because

18

the United States and the Indians entered into a kind of

19

a deal where they said, well, since no fishery right

20

could be extinguished,

21

extinguishment of the fishery right.

22

23

QUESTION:

this could not be for the
On the other hand,

Well, it said -- yes, it said it

24

didn’t distinguish the water right for a fishery, and it

25

was for what they had lost in the past.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. PRETTYMAN:

That's correct, and it was for

2

a reserved right lost in the past, so the only reserved

3

right that I know that they supposedly lost was for

4

fisheries, so I am not sure that we can say that that

5

was not for a lost fishery right.
I would like to address myself briefly to

6
7

adversity under the pleading.

We claim, of course, that

8

you do not need it in an all-inclusive water rights

9

litigation.

Every claimant is adverse to every other

10

claimant by virtue of the nature of a quiet title

11

adj udica tion.
However, in this case, we have something in

12

13

addition.

14

appendix that we have filed with our reply brief, we

15

summarize the parties in the TRO and in the final

16

decree, and what you will find is that while the United

17

States is listed as a plaintiff, the United States is

18

also listed as a defendant, and under the defendant

19

United States in brackets is listed what, the Newland

20

Project and the reservation.

21

If the Court will address itself to the

So, the court and the parties which agreed to

22

the stipulated final decree were obviously interested in

23

showing that the rights of the Newlands Project and of

24

the reservation were indeed being adjudicated'inter se,

25

and it was putting everybody on notice that that was

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

what was happening, and that is the only purpose of

2

adversity under the pleadings, to give an opportunity to

3

litigate, and to put everyone on notice that rights are

4

being adjudicated inter se.
There was not only an opportunity to litigate

5
6

here, but there was full litigation.

I would like to close and save the remainder

18
19

of my time for rebuttal with just one point.

I would

20

like to ask this Court a very simple, practical

21

question.

23

then consented to a final decree, would the Newlands

Project ever have been built, would the District Court

25

have signed that decree, would western Nevada, as a

matter of fact, been built on the basis of that final

2

decree if they had known at the time that there was

3

outstanding some secret, unresolved claim for

4

four-fifths of the water of this river which could be

5

litigated 20 years hence, 40 years hence, 100 years

6

hence, and which could totally destroy the Newlands

7

Project ?
QUESTION*

8
9
10

How much water is the government

seeking?
MR. PRETTYMAN*

The government is seeking,

11

Your Honor, approximately — between 375,000 and 400,000

12

acre feet of water.

13

QUESTION *

14

MR. PRETTYMAN i

A year?
Yes.

It would be on the

15

average, obviously. Your Honor.

16

would be to take at least half the water that is now

17

going to Newlands and divert it, and of course they

18

would have an 1859 priority for the entire 400,000.

19

There are only 500,000 acre feet in the entire river.

20

Thank you. Your Honor.

1

please the Court, the government contends in this case

2

that it owns the project water rights.

3

the Orr Ditch degree permits it to change the manner and

4

place and purpose of use of its water rights to

5

non-project purposes or uses.

It contends that

6

Basically, the government's contention is that

7

it can allocate as it chooses the Newlands Project water

8

rights to Pyramid Lake or presumably, if that argument

9

is valid, to any federal purpose that it desires,

including a possible MX missile site.
In our opinion, the government’s contention is

12

simplistic and wrong.

In fact, there is

This Court has held in Ickes versus Fox in

17

1937 that project water rights identical to these water

18

rights are appropriated for the benefit of the farmers,

19

not the United States, and that the project farmers own

20

the water rights, not the government, and that the

21

government's interest is only as a lienholder to secure

22

the repayment costs of the project.

QUESTION;

Did the government quantify the

acreage they planned to wat^r?

White, for the allocation of water to 232,000 of acres,

MR. GIRARD:

QUESTION;

Right.

7

MR. GIRARD:

And TCID itself in the Orr Ditch

to the United States, and the decree was allocated to

10

TCID to divert in the Truckee Piver agreement, which was

11

a part of the decree.

12
13
14

QUESTION;

So was all the water generated by

Newlands covered by contract with private owners?
MR. GIRARD;

There are contract water rights

15

on the Newlands project covering 73,002 acres, not

16

232,000 acres. There is nowhere near enough water to

17

irrigate 232,000 acres.

18

QUESTION;

So that is all the water there is

19

available, I take it.

20

MR. GIRARD:

That's correct, from both rivers,

QUESTION;

If you divide up the Truckee and

the Carson between the — the Crr Ditch defendants, the

have used all the water.

HR. PELCYGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3

please the Court, the Pyramid Lake Reservation was

4

established in 1859 for the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe of

5

Indians, whose name for themselves is Cui-ui Dicato,

cui-ui eaters.

7

government's intent was to include Pyramid Lake and its

"large fisheries" in the reservation, and that such a

reservation would have the advantage of being the

1

The obscure question is whether

2

the eggs that were taken from the Pyramid Lake, lahontan

3

cutthroat trout, and were deposited all over the western

4

United States prior to 1940, whether that gene pool

5

still exists in these other places and are now being

6

restored to the lake by getting eggs from those fish.

7

And in fact there was an article in Sports

8

Illustrated about three or four years ago where a

9

biologist claimed that the original trout was relocated

10

in a small stream in Utah.

But in any event, the

11

species itself exists and exists in Pyramid Lake today.
Let me say also there was nothing whatsoever

12

13

in the record in this case to suggest that

the

14

government did not assert a water right for fishery

15

purposes in the Orr Ditch case because the fishery was

16

not deemed to be a primary purpose of the reservation.
The federal court in the sturgeon case in

17
18

1879, which was a trespass case brought by the United

19

States to prosecute non-Indian fishermen at Pyramid Lake

20

specifically held that the principal purpose of the lake

21

was the fishery, and without the fishery there was

nothing.

Now, the conflict of interest, which is the

critical point from the tribes' standpoint in this case,

and which was expcessly found to exist, the District

QUESTION:

Now, that’s what T wanted — you

mentioned that earlier.

finding is that?
ME. PELCYGER;

it to you.

What

That finding is — Let me quote

On Page 185-A of the Petitioner’s appendix.

7

QUESTION*

8

MR. PELCYGER:

9

QUESTION:

Finding 9?

Is that the one?

Excuse me?

Finding 9?

MR. PELCYGER:

10

Where is that finding?

Yes.

Is that the one?
It was the intention of

11

the plaintiff, that is, the United States, by and

12

through its attorneys, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and

13

the Bureau of Reclamation, to assert as large a water

14

right as possible for the Indian reservation and to do

15

everything possible to protect the fish for the benefit

16

of the Indians and the white populations "insofar as it

17

was consistent with the larger interests involved in the

18

proposition having to do with the reclamation of

19

thousands of acres of arid and now useless land for the

20

benefit of the country as a whole."

21

-

So, this finding is a smoking gun.

It shows

22

not only the existence of the conflict, but it shows

23

that it adversely affected the performance of the

24

government’s lawyers, and the tribe’s prima ry ' submissior­

25

is that because of this government’s conflict, the tribe

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

2

was denied a full and fair opportunity to he heard.
QUESTION*

The finding doesn't guite say that

3

they would have asked for more water if they weren’t

4

acting in both capacities, though.

5

is the correct reading of it?

6

MR.

PELCYGER:

Or do you think that

Well, I think you can safely

7

say by analogy to the criminal cases, to Cuyler against

8

Sullivan and Wood against Georgia, that it certainly

9

shows that the conflict influenced the conduct of the

10

litigation and adversely affected it from the tribe's

11

standpoint.

12

Now, I think it is impossible for any court to

13

make a finding about what would have happened if this

14

wasn't there, but the finding says that there was actual

15

prejudice, and I don't see for due process purposes how

16

you could have anything more than that.

17

QUESTION*

Well, is there any evidence other

18

than — taken apart from the finding, what is the

19

evidence that the government would have sought more

20

water on behalf of the Indians had they not represented

21

the other group?

22

MR. PELCYGER;

Because every time the issue

23

was brought up, and there were specific recommendations

24

made to assert the water right, the reason that it was

25

not asserted had nothing to do with it wasn't

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

meritorious, it wasn't a primary purpose of the

2

reservation.

3

of the conflict with the Newlands Project.

4

The reason it was not asserted was because

There is a letter in the record in the joint

5

appendix, at Page 444, for example, where the Secretary

6

of the Interior says, inasmuch as there is at nearly all

7

times only enough water for irrigation purposes, it is

8

believed that it would be most difficult, if not

9

impossible, to obtain a portion for fish life.

10

And the government attorneys, the Justice

11

Department attorneys specifically said the same thing.

12

They said, a Congressman wrote to the Attorney General

13

and said, what are you doing about fish life in the

14

Truckee River?

15

answered by saying that the fishery issue was completely

16

outside the scope of the Orr Ditch case.

17

in the case.

18

And the Justice Department Attorney

It was never

And then he went on to say, "Inasmuch as the"

19

-- and this supports the justiciability argument,

20

Justice Rehnguist, "Inasmuch as the government has

21

control of the Derby Dam, I have always thought that the

22

Reclamation Service and the Indian Service, both bureaus

23

of the Department of the Interior, could settle the

24

matter between them as to providing the proper fishways

25

and comparatively small amount of water which may be

needed to enable the fish to pass up the fishways.'*
So, the Justice Department knew that it wasn't

3

an issue that could and should have been litigated.

4

Justice Department knew that it had to be settled

5

administratively and couldn't be litigated in a case in

6

which the Justice Department was representing both of

7

those bureaus through the Secretary of the Interior.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. KNEEDLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

14

and may it please the Court, I would like to make

15

something clear at the outset of my argument.

16

government is not asserting that it owns the water

17

rights in this case and that it has a right to

18

reallocate that water willy-nilly to any use it might

19

desire, to a wildlife refuge, to the MX missile.

20

not asserting any such right.

21

The

We are

The narrow guestion involved at this

22

interlocutory stage of the case is whether the United

23

States and the tribe are absolutely barred by the

24

doctrine of res judicata, from seeking to establish a

25

prior reserved water right for the fishery on their

reservation.

This case does not concern what rights the

2

individual Neviands Project landowners might have under

3

the contracts that they entered into with the United

4

S ta tes.
QUESTION;

5

Suppose, Mr. Kneedler, they had

been absolute parties, named parties by the -- in the

distinguishing factor.

QUESTION;

I think on the question of res

I would think it would, but you

16

think this case is different just because the United

17

States was sitting there with a bunch of contracts with

18

landowners, and they got a final decree in the United

19

States’ favor for the Newlands Project, knowing all the

20

time that they had contracted away all of that water

21

that was available, and that — don't you think that the

22

United States at least ought to be subject to specific

23

performance of their contracts rather than — rather

24

than take the water away and let the — and have to pay

25

for it?

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. KNEEDLERi

1

There are several responses.

2

First, the Unite! States is ordinarily not subject to

3

specific performance for its contracts.

What those

4

contracts would have -- Let me go back.

The issue in

5

this case essentially at this point, where the tribe now

6

is a party, and the Newlands Project water users now are

7

parties, is whether the claims asserted on behalf of

8

each of them are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.
Neither the tribe nor the individual water

9
10

users was a party to the prior decree.

But beyond that,

11

the water rights that each asserts now was not

2

adjudicated in the prior decree.

We have the District

3

Court's finding that the fishery right which the tribe

4

and the Unite! States on its behalf were assertina was

5

not involved .
But getting to Mr. Justice White's point, the

6
7

rights of the individual project water users were not

8

adjudicated in Orr Ditch.

ME. KNEEDLEE:

the answer is no.

Well, for -- I think that's

quite important for the purposes of res judicata,

10

because what we are talking about under res judicata is

11

looking at the confines of the decree and what effect

12

should be given to the decree.

13

in fact the District Court in this very case found that

14

the United States appeared in a representative capacity

15

on behalf of the Indians, but it did not say that the

United States appeared in a representative fiduciary

capacity on behalf of the individual project water

QUESTION:

Yes.

And if the government, the United

States should ultimately prevail in this case, would it

be the obligation of the United States government to

condemn those rights and pay compensation.
SR. KNEEDLER:

Powell, I am not at liberty to concede that the United

QUESTION:

SR. KNEEDLER:

Certainly there would be a

cause of action for either breach of contract or for

1

being put at the time this very case was brought, and

2

the District Court's findings in this case concur with

3

what Mr. Pelcyger said.

4

The District Court's findings establish in our

5

view, unfortunately, that the executive officials within

6

the Interior Department resolved the conflict of

7

purposes with which they were confronted against the

8

reservation and in favor of the Newlands Project, and in

9

addition to the particular finding that Mr. Pelcyger

10

relied on, I would also like to refer the Court to Page

11

165-ft of Nevada's appendix to Nevada's petition, where

12

the Court says, “The United States was sguarely

13

presented” with a conflict of purposes that was

14

"apparent and foreseeable," deriving from the need to

15

satisfy water rights for the reservation and for the

16

project out of a limited quantity of water.

is thus the opposite end of the spectrum from what the

Court had in Arizona versus California.

at least one of your grounds, that the Court of Appeals

What the Court of Appeals

19

said is that the judgment in Orr Ditch should not be

20

read to have conclusively decided all causes of action

21

between the tribe and TCID, because of the lack of

22

setting up those claims in an adverse sense.

23

What I have explained here is why the terms of

24

the Orr Ditch decree in fact established that; that they

25

did not adjudicate either the individual water rights

depends on the decree.

I would like to address briefly whether we

17

of the restatement of judgments relying on adversity

18

under the pleadings.

19

that rule is sensible or not sensible, and the fact that

20

the restatement has reinvoked it suggests that it is of

21

continuing vitality, but the important point for this

22

case is that the question of res judicata goes to the

23

effect of the Orr Ditch decree.

the defendants, but did not do that among the interests

Mr. Kneedler, is there a federal

rule of res judicata that should apply in this case, or

does it depend on the law of the state of Nevada?

10

would be a federal rule of res judicata because the

rights being asserted here were federal rights.

I mean, do you

18

know of a case that says there should be a federal rule

19

of res judicata under these circumstances?

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

Offhand I do not, but I would

21

think ordinarily that the -- there might be a separate

22

question of whether federal law would adopt state law,

23

but ordinarily I would think in a federal suit brought

24

by the United States to declare federal water rights

25

that there would be a federal rule of res judicata.

assuring alversity on the pleadings among the defendants

did not do that for the respective rights being asserted

in this case to assure some way in which those rights

I would simply say in regard to Mr. Kneedler's

20

main point, if he can take this water and do with it as
