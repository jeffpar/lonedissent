ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY HARFIELD, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. HARFIELDs

9

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case was begun by a Cuban

10

government instrumentality in February, 1961.

11

government instrumentality, Banco Para El Comercio

12

Exterior de Cuba, which translates to Bank — the

13

Foreign Trade Bank of Cuba, and which for convenience we

14

are going to call Bancec, was suing to recover a sum of

15

money.

16

The Cuban

In its answer, the defendant, which I am going

17

to call Citibank, again for the sake of convenience, in

18

its answer, Citibank alleged that the action was brought

19

by and for the Republic of Cuba, Bancec being a mere

20

segment or instrumentality, an indistinguishable and

21

integral part of the Cuban government.

22

Citibank then asserted as a defensive

23

counterclaim to curtail the sum of money that was sought

24

by Bancec in this case its claim for an amount of money

25

equivalent to the value of its properties in Cuba, its

2

any compensation by the Cuban government in a manner

3

which the Second Circuit from which this case comes has

4

held was in violation of international law.

The question here is who is the real

Now, some three weeks after the commencement

10
11

of this action by Bancec the Cuban government dissolved

12

Bancec and exercised direct dominion over all of

13

Bancec's assets, including the claim in this case.

14

Thereafter, some several months later, the respondent

15

sought and obtained from the court in which the action

16

was pending leave to substitute the Republic of Cuba as

17

the plaintiff in the action, and that leave was granted,

18

and leave was granted to file a supplemental complaint

19

in which it was alleged that the claim which is the

20

subject of this action was assumed by the Republic of

21

Cuba.

3

HR. HARFIELDi

Well,

this was an application

4

by counsel for a party to substitute another party,

5

another person as the party plaintiff, and the Court in

6

this case on stipulation, on the agreement of the

7

defendant, said it is so ordered.

technically it did not effect a substitution.

Are you suggesting that certain

inferences can be drawn as a result of that?

15

MR. HARFIELDt

16

QUESTION*

Yes, I think so, Your Honor.

Hr. Harfield, you don't contend

17

that Bancec is somehow unable to proceed in the

18

litigation because it was dissolved,

19

MR. HARFIELDs

I take it.

Well, I am troubled by that,

20

Justice O'Connor.

21

difficult for Bancec as such to proceed in the

22

litigation, and if I --

I should

MR. HARFIELDi

It was

Did you take that position below?
We simply took the position

that there was an identity between Bancec or, if you

like, between Bancec's ghost and the Republic of- Cuba,

2

the Cuban government.

3
4

QUESTION;

But you didn't argue that because

Bancec was dissolved, it couldn't proceed?

5

MR. HARFIELD:

No, we did not argue that the

6

act of dissolution was what did it.

7

8

place.
QUESTION;

9

We said that in

Did you argue below that regardless

10

of Bancec's situation, that you could assert the

11

counterclaim in any event because the Cuban government

12

or Banco Nacional had appeared?
MR. HARFIELD;

13

We did not put it on the ground

14

of an appearance by the Cuban government or Banco

15

Nacional.

16

Court after trial found that at least for purposes of

17

this litigation, there was a commonality among the Cuban

18

government, Banco Nacional, Bancec when Bancec was in

19

existence.

20

We argued that there — and the District

QUESTION:

Well, I guess the courts below

21

didn't really resolve the question about whether the

22

assets had gone to Banco Nacional at one time or had

23

gone to the Cuban government.

24

the fact that Bancec was an alter ego of the Cuban

25

government.

It seemed to base it on

So they didn't decide the other --

1

MR. HftRFIELDi

There is — I think it was

2

decided, Justice O'Connor.

3

obscure and repetitious, and I think it is a mistake,

4

unfortunate that we talk about alter ego or the like.

5

What we are really talking about here is whether, as

6

used to be the case back in the days of the alien

7

property custodian, whether there is a cloaking

8

operation by a corporation.

9

The language is somewhat

The trial judge certainly used the words

10

"alter ego,” but his -- or one of his overall statements

11

as to his findings was that no matter how regarded,

12

whether this was -- the circumstances, the relationship

13

of Bancec during its existence and the Cuban government,

14

taken together with the devolution of the claim, as he

15

put it, upon Bancec*s dissolution, made it clear that

16

the claim was now the claim of the Republic of Cuba or

17

of Banco Nacional which had been held to be the alter

18

ego of the Republic of Cuba, that it was in effect —

19

the Republic of Cuba was the party opposed in interest,

20

the protagonist of this case.

21

And that is what really we were looking for

22

down there,

23

pushing this case?

24
25

was what the court was looking fori

QUESTTONi

who is

Well, is the question, who is the

real party in interest?

1

MR. HARFIELDi

Well, I think that's one way of

2

formulating it.

I have used the word "protagonist"

3

because I am trying to avoid these mystique words or

4

phrases of art, such as "real party in interest" and

5

"alter ego."

6

who is pushing this claim, and the best word I find for

7

that in the dictionary is the protagonist.

I think the question is, who is the person

8

I'm not sure that answers your question.

9

QUESTIONS

I am puzzled by why you distinguish

10

that from real party in interest, which is common in all

11

kinds of civil litigation.

12

MR. HARFIELD;

Yes, and I am perfectly content

13

to accept that as the real party in interest.

14

think we used that phrase in the pleadings.

15
16
17

QUESTION;

Indeed, I

And your position is that the

government of Cuba is the real party in interest.
MR. HARFIELD;

Is the real party in interest

18

and has been throughout, and in that context, if I may,

19

I would like to point out that — one other fact here.

20

After the government of Cuba had dissolved Bancec and,

21

shall I say, retrieved the claim in this case, after

22

this stipulation had been entered in the court in

23

some 14 years later but still before trial,

24

respondent asked that another Cuban government

25

instrumentality, short name Cubazucar, be substituted as

1961,

the party plaintiff, because that was, if you like, then

2

the real party in interest.

3

succession.
I think real party in interest is a proper way

4
5

There had been this

to examine it.

The question as I see it —

6

QUESTION;

Mr. Harfield —

7

MR. HARFIELDs

— is that the task of the

8

trial judge, the factfinding task that he had was to

9

find out who is pushing the claim and who is pushing the

10

counterclaim.
QUESTION;

11

I was just going to make that

12

inquiry, and I gather that Judge Grant did find pretty,

13

much in your favor --

14

MR. HARFIELD;

15

QUESTION;

Yes, he did.

— on that point, but the Court of

16

Appeals certainly did not affirm his finding, did it?

17

had some doubt as to just what the Court of Appeals did

18

with it.
MR. HARFIELD;

19
20

So did I.

What the Court of

Appeals —

21

QUESTION;

22

MR. HARFIELD;

23

(General laughter.)

24

MR. HARFIELD;

25

I

Except that you lost.
Yes, I knew that.

The Court of Appeals said that

they agree! with the District Court's description of the

9

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

functions of Bancac and its status as a wholly owned

2

instrumentality of the government of Cuba, but it

3

disagreed with its conclusions, and there we come to

4

what is, I think, the real mischief in this case, or of

5

the decision of the Court of Appeals, because what they

6

did was in effect to reverse the whole procedure, and

7

they said Bancec is set up, notwithstanding our

8

agreement as to the status of the functions for the

9

District Court and found it was a cloak, but they said

10

Bancec — the origin of Bancec's claim was a commercial

11

transaction.

12

commercial transaction.

13

The origin of the counterclaim was not a

Bancec, when it was in existence, had nothing

14

to do with the subject matter of the counterclaim.

15

Therefore you can't oppose these.

16

that argument, but what they said was, because you can't

17

oppose these, they are not alter egos, and that leaves

18

me completely confused.

19
20

QUESTION;

You can understand

If it was not a commercial

transaction, how was it characterized by —

21

HR. HARFIELD;

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. HARFIELDi

The basis for the counterclaim?

Yes.
It was characterized as a

24

breach of international law.

And we have -- we were

25

here before on the question — in the Banco Nacional

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

case, on the question of whether that counterclaim could

2

be asserted notwithstanding the active state doctrine,

3

which is something I hope we don't have to reargue

4

today.

5

Court sent that Banco Nacional case back to the Second

6

Circuit and said, find out whether there are any other

7

grounds for holding in favor of the Cuban

8

instrumentality, in that case Banco Nacional, and the

9

Second Circuit said no.

10

3ut the — at that time the holding — this

They said Banco Nacional is the

alter ego, if you like, of the Cuban government.
Number Two , there was a clear violation of

11
12

international law in taking Citibank’s branches, and on

13

that basis they held for the City — for Citibank in

14

that case.

15

question that the transaction on which the counterclaim

16

is based is not the same counterclaim that the claim is

17

based on.

18

So, there you do have — there is no

But Rule 13(b) says that doesn't make any

19

difference.

20

origin of the claims but the opposition of the parties

21

in interest, of the claimant and counter claimant, and

22

the relief that is sought is precisely the same.

23

just talking about money.

24

trying to recapture property that was taken there.

25

The issue is not the opposition of the

QUESTION!

We are

This isn’t a question of

What significance do you think the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Court of Appeals attached to the fact that your claim

2

had not arisen out of the same transaction as the bank's

3

had?

4

SR. HARFIELDi

I think it is unwholesome to

5

put words in the appellate court’s mouth.

6

that that was the only way they could think of to come

7

out where they wanted.

8

the question because I can’t understand it.

9

My guess was

I simply can't — I can’t answer

The -net effect of this was that we have a

10

finding by the District Court that there was an identity

11

of interest.

12

that because the transactions didn't mesh, it didn't —■

13

they are not the same party, and I think that is clearly

14

— the Couct of Appeals was clearly in error.

We have the Second Circuit saying, we find

15

Sow, the mischief of this is that what they

16

are doing is to impose a test which in effect forms a

17

blueprint for any foreign government that chooses to do

18

so by arranging its own wardrobe, if you like, in a

19

proper fashion, to come in here as a plaintiff and

20

escape the liabilities that would attach if it came in

21

on its own,

22

of set off counterclaim or other defenses, other

23

defenses.

24
25

the liabilities that would attach by reason

The respondent goes a great deal farther than
the Court of Appeals did.

I think the Court of Appeals

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

was in error.

2

is allowed to stand.

3

is that the presumption, which everyone admits, the

4

presumption of independence of a corporation, is in

5

effect a conclusive presumption if it is a foreign

6

corporation, a foreign government corporation.

7

They are making new law if this decision
But what the respondent is urging

He says foreign government corporations are

8

sui generis, and in effect whatever is said about them

9

by their parent government must be taken.

10
11

12

13

This

precludes inquiry by a court —
QUESTION!

But then you are back to the act of

state doctrine, are you not?
MB. HARFIELDi

Well, if you carry that to its

14

extreme, it certainly is dragging the act of state

15

doctrine in the back door and it is like dragging the

16

cat back in the back door after the cat has had kittens,

17

because there is a lot more to it than just the plain

18

act of state doctrine.

19

My peroration of this, I sum up the situation,

20

the position -- the petitioner's position is this, that

21

there can be no serious doubt that the Republic of Cuba

22

is the real protagonist, the real party in interest in

23

this case, and that the parties opposed in interest are

24

the Republic of Cuba and Citibank.

25

international law nor under federal law — Under both

Neither under

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

international and federal law,

2

fact is that Citibank is entitled to curtail the

3

recovery that is sought in this case, and that right of

4

curtailment, the right to assert that defense

5

effectively, should not be defeated in this case because

6

the order to take over Citibank's branches, which is the

7

basis for their counterclaim, because that order was

8

signed by Che Guevera as president of Bancec instead of

9

Che Guevera as president of Banco Nacional.

10

the consequence of that

The normal consequences flowing from both

11

federal and international law, which is that the

12

question of the identity of a party is a matter for the

13

forum to determine, that can't be and shouldn't be

14

averted by being bound, handicapping the court,

15

handcuffing the court if a foreign government simply

16

says the immunity that we confer, the characteristics

17

that we confer on a creature of ours in our country are

18

binding on you in your country.

19

There, I think, is the danger of what will

20

come about,

and that, of course, is something that I

21

think invokes the interest of the United States, as to

22

which I don't pretend to speak.

23

I would like to reserve my time.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

25

Hr. Wilkins.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. WILKINS, ES.,

2

PRO HAC VICE FOR U.S. AS AMICUS CURIAE

3

MR. WILKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

4

please the Court, the United States believes that the

5

issue presented by this case is whether or not an

6

instrumentality of a foreign state could bring suit in

7

United States court should be insulated from a

8

counterclaim properly asserted against the state on the

9

sole basis that that state instrumentality did not play

10

a key role in the wrongful conduct of the state.

11

The Court of Appeals has answered this

12

question in the affirmative, and by so doing, has

13

rendered irrelevant a broad range of legal and equitable

14

factors that United States courts and foreign courts

15

have traditionally analyzed in attributing

16

responsibility between and among nominally separate

17

corporate entities.

18

The United States has a significant interest

19

in addressing or suggesting that this is an erroneous

20

approach, because by limiting the alter ego question to

21

a single narrow factor, that is, whether or not the

22

state entity played a key role in wrongful conduct, the

23

court below has unnecessarily and unduly restricted the

24

ability of American defendants to raise valid

25

counterclaims in suits brought against them by foreign

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

governments
Respondent in this court would go even further

2

3

than the Court of Appeals. He argues, or it argues that

4

international law requires this Court to apply Cuban

5

law, not only to establish its separate identity, but

6

also its absolute non-liability for the acts of the

7

Cuban state.
The Court of Appeals, of course, didn't even

8

9

go this far when it recognized that Bancec’s separate

10

status under Cuban law could and would be disregarded if

11

Bancec did indeed play a key role in the wrongful

12

conduct of the state.

13

although it is exhaustively examinei by respondent, does

14

no more than establish a presumption, which we

15

recognize, that United States and other foreign courts

16

will generally recognize the independent status of

17

Bancec.

International law, moreover,

That presumption, however, is not conclusive.

18
19

United State courts and foreign courts have never held

20

that foreign law is conclusive on the alter ego

21

question.

22

inquiry is undertaken.

23

Court of Appeals in the Trentex Trading Corporation case

24

stated that whether a state-owned entity should be

25

considered the alter ego of its parent should not depend

We cite many cases in our brief where that

on foreign law alone.

Rather, he stated, he would "look

2

to all the evidence to see whether the organization was

3

under government control and exercising governmental

4

f unctions."
The error of the court below is that it

5

6

pretermits this sort of inquiry that courts throughout

7

the world have found necessary to resolve this alter ego

8

question.

QUESTION;

That may be, but what is the source

of the law on it?
MR. WILKINS;

The source of the law.

In this

case it is -QUESTION;

around the world find it necessary to determine it.

MR. WILKINS;

They look at all the

19

context of state-owned entities have focused on two

whether or not —

Mr. Justice White's question about the source of law.

2

And it is this last factor which is stressed perhaps

3

most strongly by the government and petitioner in their

But the focus of the inquiry is misplaced.

ago in international law by that extensive network of

by which

it was — by which two things were recognized;

one,

that sovereign immunity is inappropriate for commercial

activity; and two, part and parcel of that accommodation

that the limited liability of government corporations

And we think, given their source, they should

prevail in the forma tion of any rule of common -- rule

of federal common la w here.

4

about those policies , if they are not clear, then we

5

think petitioner and the executive should go to

Congress, because Co ngress is the branch of government

which resolves such policy matters.

And that i s -- we think that's the teaching of
the Court's decision s on federal common law generally,

10

and we think as well that that teaching is underlined

11

strongly by the prio r Cuban cases in this Court,

12

Whatever c ontroversy there might have been

13

over the role of the courts there, there was, I suggest,

14

broad agreement that the role in this area is more

15

modest and more limi ted than normal, and that the Court

16

acting as a national court, as it must, is on firmer

17

ground when it seeks to apply international law than

18

when it is asked to frame a rule of law on its own.

understand the basis upon which the Court itself could

But more critically, there will be — there is

the question of whether the Court can make a decision as

of trade based upon the limited liability of these

Mr. Krinsky, may I just throw out —

MR. KRINSKY:

QUESTION:

15

For the sake of —

May I ask you just one question

please?
MR. KRINSKY:

For the sake of what the

petitioner seeks.
QUESTION:

Mr. Krinsky, do we look at the case

16

as of the time the complaint was filed, or as of today?

17

There has been about a 20-year lapse of time, and there

18

is material in the record that suggests very strongly

19

that the ownership of the claim now is in the government

20

itself, or much more closely so than in Bancec.

21

MR. KRINSKY:

Your Honor, let me address th®

22

question of where the ownership is now.

Our position is

23

that the ownership is in a state trading corporation by

24

the name of Cubazucar.

25

was involved in the Primero Congresso case in the House

It is the same corporation which

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

of Lords, and which was held to be a separate entity,

2

not responsible for the acts of the Cuban government in

3

that case.

4

We assert, and our position has always been in

5

the District Court, that the claim went from Eancec to

6

the state entesis.

7

state impressor as the successor.

8

District Court because it did not want to introduce into

9

the case, which it considered a complicated case, new

We made a motion to substitute this
It was denied by the

10

issues, and the new issue that was excluded was

11

precisely what happened upon the dissolution of Bancec.

2

And that is how the case was tried.

It was

3

tried by the plaintiff that way and it was tried by the

4

defendant that way, and indeed, when one looks at the

5

post-trial requests for findings of fact and conclusions

6

of law by the respondent — I’m sorry, by the

7

petitioner, there is no request for a finding as to the

8

identity of who held the claim after Bancec.

9

And it is for that reason that we did not

20

introduce expert testimony on what is a question of

2

foreign law.

22

case, despite it having been excluded in this way, we

23

believe that we should be entitled to an opportunity of

24

introducing that expert testimony on foreign law.

25

And indeed, if that issue is still in the

Now, on the merits of the claim, we have

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

always taken the position that upon Bancec

2

dissolution, the claim went to the succeeding state

3

enterprise, and if one reads Law Number 934, which is

4

the critical law here, it says Bancec is dissolved and

5

its assets are transferred to the new state

6

enterprises.

7

cr

It is in the present tense.

Me think there was no foundation, no

8

foundation in the record for this position, and indeed,

9

it is not procedurally proper, properly in the case any

10
11

longer.
There is another aspect of the situation,

12

however, in which the case properly should be looked at,

13

I think, from the vantage point of the present day, and

14

that is the impact of the freeze regulations and what

15

Congress has done on the question of separate entity,

16

the question of nationalizations in general and Cuba,

17

Cuban nationalizations in particular.

18

It is difficult to conceive of what issue of

19

policy or equity relevant to this case has not been

20

addressed by Congress and answered by Congress.

21

Congress had ratified the freeze of all property in the

22

United States of Cuba, of Cuban government corporations,

23

and of Cuban nationals.

QUESTION;

4

Mr. Kr insky, what then is the

5

motive of your client to co ntinue to litigate this issue

6

if you are not going to get anything out of it anyway?
MR. KRINSKY:

7

You r Honor, we have been

8

instructed by our client to litigate the issue, and we

9

have not been told the reas on why.
The Congress has said something else here of

10
11

great importance, and that is on the question of

12

equity.

13

nationalization claims, not just Citibank's claims, all

14

nationalization claims, and the Foreign Claims

15

Settlement Commission has m et for many years and has

16

certified claims of individ uals, of corporations,

17

It established a p rogram of certifying

And the reason wh y Congress did that was to

18

provide an equitable basis for the distribution of all

19

frozen funds in the United States in the event of a

20

settlement.

21

petitioner would be contrar y to that policy.

22

this case, according to the Congress, is that the funds

23

be available for distributi on to all the claimants,

24

that Citibank, obtains a pre ference.

25

The result her e of a judgment in favor of

And it is, again,

Equity in

39

1

the Unite! States and the equitable notions of the

2

United States as established by Congress which should

3

govern this controversy.

4

There is, Your Honor, a notion in these cases

5

of looking to the overall interests of the United

6

States.

7

to define those interests and what are the sources of

8

law to govern.

9

international law provides that basis.

There is, however, counterposed to this who is

We have argued, we believe, that
There is no

10

distinction between this respondent and other government

11

corporations.

12

each government corporation to be evaluated according to

13

the local law of the forum will leave nothing, nothing

14

of the international law of state trading and government

15

corporations.

16

The rule of law which allows each case,

Ml that would be left is all government

17

corporations in doubt, and every country invited to

18

apply its own notions of what is a proper government

19

corporation, and indeed precisely as Congress feared,

20

each country will be invited to apply its local notions

21

of what is a proper private corporation and what is the

22

proper relationship between a parent corporation, a

23

United States parent corporation and its subsidiary.

24

We think that is a result which has no basis

25

in law, and to the extent that policy concerning it is

1

to be changed, it should be done by Congress or by the

2

executive in the international area advocating a

3

different position.
I believe, Your Honor, that is all I have to

4
5

say .

Do you have anything further, Mr. Harfield?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY HARFIELD, ESQ.,

9

10

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. HARFIELD:

Just this, that I think that

11

what has been indicated by the respondent's argument is

12

that the case must be either looked at on the facts of

13

the case where we have findings or it must be looked at

14

in terms of the generalities.

15

generalities are concerned, which Mr. Krinsky has

16

discussed, I think he is wrong on them, but I think

17

where he is mainly wrong is in his election to speak for

18

what the policy of the United States and what the

19

interest of the United States ought to be.
