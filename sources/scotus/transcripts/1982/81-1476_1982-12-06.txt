The questions in these cases are matters of

1

2

statutory interpretation.

3

the Internal Revenue Code are Section 6334, which

4

exempts certain classes of property from the reach —

5

from levy for federal taxes. Section 6321, which creates

6

a lien against all property belonging to a delinquent

7

taxpayer and in favor of the government, Section 7403,

8

which provides for a civil action to enforce a tax lien

9

against any property in which a delinquent taxpayer has

The relevant provisions of

any right, title, or interest.
Except for the very narrow exemptions set out

11
12

in Section 6334, all of the delinquent taxpayer’s

13

property and rights in property are subject to levy to

14

satisfy federal tax liens, federal tax claims.

15

Homestead property is not mentioned in Section 6334, nor

16

does any other federal statute purport to exempt such

17

property from federal tax claims.

18

State laws exempting property from the claims

19

of private creditors are wholly ineffective against the

20

federal government.

21

regulations are quite explicit on this point.

22

provision of a state law may exempt property or rights

23

to property from levy for the collection of any federal

24

tax.

Under Section 6321, the United States has a

demand.

position straight.

9

susceptibility of a homestead to the enforcement of a

10

federal tax lien, but is it the government’s position

11

that if the delinquent taxpayer owns any interest in a

12

homestead, any partial interest, that it may proceed to

13

sell the entire homestead?

14

I don’t think any of us question the

MR. JONES:

Our position is that Congress has

15

authorized the Attorney General to file suit against any

16

property in which the delinquent taxpayer has an

17

interest, and our position is that there may be

18

circumstances, not present here, in which it would" be

19

appropriate to sell only the delinquent taxpayer’s

20

interest, but where that can’t be done, the government

21

is entitled to sell the entire property with division of

22

the proceeds as the means of accommodating the interest

23

of any other parties who have interest.

So that here you would, in effect,

sell the homestead under Mrs. Rodgers, who continued to

MR. JONES;

That’s essentially correct.
Well, essentially?

Isn’t it

correct?

7

MR. JONES;

8

QUESTION;

9

You would in

That is absolutely correct.
Now, then, let me ask you this.

Suppose your delinquent taxpayer is a person who holds a

10

mortgage on my property, and the government moves in to

11

enforce the lien, the tax lien on the mortgage.

12

that mean that it can sell my property?
MR. JONES;

13

Does

Well, I am not clear that the

14

mortgagee’s interest in your property would be

sufficient for the government’s tax lien to attach.

'18

isn ’t it?

19

Well, it is an interest in

It is an interest in my homestead property,

MR. JONES;

Well, if it is. Congress has said

20

that under Section 7403, the government may proceed

21

against any property in which the taxpayer has an

22

interest or in which the government has a lien.

23

the district director or the Secretary certainly may

24

take into account your interest in the property or any

25

other interest in the property in determining whether to

1

proceed against the property by means of foreclosure

2

under Section 7403 or by administrative levy, but once

3

the district director or the Secretary of the Treasury

4

has made that determination, Congress has provided for

5

enforcement of the tax lien.
QUESTION:

6

Well, I am just suggesting that I

7

think the ultimate — your argument taken to the

8

ultimate conclusion means that they can sell my property

9

in order to foreclose the lien on the mortgagee’s

10

property.
Let me put it another way.

11

Suppose that my

12

next door neighbor has an easement over my homestead

13

property, and he is delinquent in taxes.

14

government foreclose on his easement and hence sell my

15

property?

16

HR. JONES:

Hay the

Well, the easement might be

17

marketable independent of the property, and it might be

18

permissible to attempt to sell the easement without

19

selling your property as well.

20

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that in fact what the

21

government does, is sell the interest of their holding

22

of the easement?

23

MR. JONES:

Where that is possible, where

24

there is a separate market for the property, the

25

government may indeed decide to proceed in that manner.

QUESTIONS

1

Why can’t the government in this

2

case sell Mr. Rodgers’ interest, Mr. Rodgers’ estate’s

3

interest in the homestead, which is basically an

4

interest that will become possessory after Mrs. Rodgers

either dies or gives up the homestead?

If

Mrs. Rodgers is elderly, and isn’t going to live long,

10

and the property has substantial value, how can you say

11

there is no interest?
MR. JONESs

12

Well, I said there is no separate

13

market for a fractional interest of the sort involved in

14

this case.

The sale —
QUESTION;

You just told me that that is not

the government's position, that you want the whole

bundle of wax.

18

and give her her share of the proceeds.

19

You want to sell the whole homestead,

MR. JONESs

Well, this case is quite different

20

from the hypotheticals you posed, because under Texas

21

law community property under the joint control of both

22

spouses is subject to the claims of creditors of either

23

spouse for debts incurred during the marriage, and

24

therefore our position is that Mrs. Rodgers isn't

25

entitled to any part of the proceeds in this case.

That's correct, without Mrs.

Why should the government

You say that the government,

though, doesn't simply stand in the shoes of Mr.

Rodgers.

Whose shoes does it stand in?

23

MR. JONES:

The government is entitled to the

24

rights Congress has provided.

25

QUESTION:

Under Section 7403 —

What rights has Congress provided

11

1

other than the rights that belonged to Hr. Rodgers,

2

against whom the lien —
MR. JONES'*

3

Well, Congress created a lien on

4

the property for the payment of the taxes, and under

5

Section 7403, the government is entitled to enforce that

6

lien by forcing sale of the property and division of the

7

proceeds in accordance with the respective interests of

8

any other parties who have claims against the property.

statute?

has to be.

It is the husband's interest, isn't it?

MR. JONES*

16

It

I am not sure I understand the

17

question.

State law says that the husband had a

18

property interest, and the court of appeals held that

19

each of the delinquent taxpayers in these cases had an

20

undivided one-half interest in the property.

21

addition, however, under Texas law, community property

22

is subject to the claims of creditors for debts incurred

23

during the marriage.

24

both spouses have a sufficient property interest in all

25

community property to subject it, the property to the

It appears therefore that in Texas

2

claims of any creditors of either one of them.
To further answer Justice O'Connor’s question,

3

where there is no interest, or no separate market for a

4

fractional interest, both the taxpayer and the

5

government would be harmed or suffer detriment by

6

attempting to sell just the fractional interest.

7

QUESTION;

What if you have A and B, tenants

8

in common under state law, not related by marriage or

9

otherwise, and the law of the state is that one tenant

10

in common cannot force another tenant in common to sell

11

the property.

12

And the government has a tax claim against A.

13

think under the statute that you are claiming under that

14

the government can force both tenants in common to sell

15

the property, to sell the physical property rather than

16

just the tenancy in common interest of the one against

17

whom it has a tax lien?

18

All you can do is sell your interest.

MR. JONES*

Do you

If there were a separate market

19

for A's half of the property, then there wouldn't be any

20

need to sell both interests, but if there wasn’t, the

21

government would be entitled to have the entire property

22

sold and division of the proceeds in accordance with the

23

interests of A and B.

24
25

QUESTION:

So it is almost a separate inquiry

in each one of these cases whether there is a separate

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

somewhere?
HR. JONES:

3

Do you find that in the statute

No, the focus of the 1936

4

amendments was on providing — amendments to Section

5

7403 was on providing an effective remedy for

6

foreclosure against personal property, and Congress -QUESTION:

7

Can I interrupt you?

To put this

8

on a little broader proposition — I guess some of the

9

other questions the same way — in the Rodgers brief at

10

Page 18, they rely on a rather broad principle that the

11

collector has rights no greater than those of the

12

taxpayer whose rights to property he seeks to foreclose

13

on, that you can't go beyond the shoes of the taxpayer

14

in fact, and you didn’t respond to that in your reply

15

brief.

16

17

taxpayer himself could have asserted?

I just wonder if other than this case, has the

MR. JONES:

18

Well, I don’t know how many

19

cases.

There is at least one.

In any context.
It is somewhat difficult to answer

that question, because the rights of a lienholder would

MR. JONES:

Well, for an easement, there -- an

17

easement, as I remember from law school, may well be of

18

value to individuals other than the person holding it,

19

and they are transferrable, unless there is a limitation

20

in the document granting the easement, and it may well

21

be that an easement can be sold without interfering with

22

your interest in the property at all.

HR. JONES;

True, and all of those factors

11

Well, if you can't keep any more

QUESTION:

That is —
Which you have asserted is very

small.
MR. JONESi

No, there is a difference, I

19

think, between saying that a property -- that a

20

particular fractional interest is unmarketable because

21

no one would be willing to buy it and saying that the

22

taxpayer's interest is without value.

23

beyond any question that both of the delinquent

24

taxpayers had an undivided one-half interest, 50 percent

25

interest in the homestead property.

Here, it is clear

1

In addition, and just as to that, the -- well,

2

and in addition, the Rodgers homestead is estimated to

3

be worth about £150,000, so the government is entitled

4

to at least 50 percent of the proceeds of any sale.

5

Our point is that attempting to sell Mr.

6

Rodgers' one-half interest that a tax sale purchaser

7

couldn't do anything with until Mrs. Rodgers decided to

8

abandon the homestead or for some other reason

9

terminated, because nobody would be interested in buying

10

this one-half interest, or at least there is no

11

established market for it, because of the limitations on

12

facts in this case are no different from Folsom.
What you have are joint owners of property,

3

one of the joint owners being a delinquent taxpayer, and

4

the other not a taxpayer, and the question is to what

5

extent the government is entitled to sell the interests

of the non-delinquent taxpayer in order to maximize the

7

return of the sale or the proceeds of its sale to the

8

benefit of both the government's tax collection efforts

9

and the interest of the taxpayer in satisfying his tax

10
11

liability.
The court of appeals in this case focused on

12

the non-delinquent taxpayer's interest in the property.

13

According to the court of appeals, if the delinquent

14

taxpayer's homestead rights are characterized as

15

property rights under state law, the government cannot

SR. JONES*

That's right, and although the

14

court of appeals purported to leave open the possibility

15

that at some point the government might be allowed to

16

enforce its lien, there is no guarantee that the value

17

of the liens won’t be substantially eroded in the

meantime, and furthermore, the liens might be lost

keep track of the proceeds of any disposition of the

To this claim, we

First, there can be no foreclosure of the

21

separate homestead property because in Texas it is

22

indivisible, it is individual to her, and it is

23

indefeasible during her lifetime or until her earlier

24

voluntary relinquishment.

25

Secondly, that the district court's judgment

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

not ordering foreclosure in the Rodgers case should not

2

be disturbed here, because the government has made no

3

claim of abuse of discretion, and hasn't even attempted

4

to overturn that finding on that ground.
Since the Congress defined the source from

5

6

which tax liability may be enforced, that is, property

7

and rights to property of the taxpayer, it is clear here

8

that the government is simply attempting to attack and

9

utterly destroy the property of someone else.

It is

10

imperative that we examine not only the property and

11

rights to property of the taxpayer here, the deceased

12

husband, but similarly we must examine those property

13

interests of others who would be affected or who own

14

individually property that doesn't belong to the

15

taxpayer.
In Texas, it has been a venerable policy for

16
17

over 100 years, Texas constitutional law since 1876, and

18

statutory law for many years before that, that each

19

spouse is entitled to use and possess the homestead for

13

We suggest that that is the proper rule.

As

14

this Court said repeatedly, as we pointed out earlier,

Busse, Durham Lumber Company, and others, it is a proper

balance, a logical and sound position to rely on the

QUESTION*

May it?

No.

So you are talking about not only

11

where a joint tenant is deceased, but at any time there

12

is a joint tenancy with right of survivorship, the

13

government may not foreclose on the property.

14

MB. ELLIOTTs

That's correct, because the

15

underlying property interest. Justice White, expires.

16

It does no longer exist after the death of the first

17

spouse to die.

18

QUESTION*

Well, certainly there are a lot of

19

— there are plenty of cases, aren’t there, or maybe not

20

so many, that do permit the government to foreclose

21

during the lifetime of one of the joint tenants.

22

Section 7403(c) gives the

23

district court the power to compel foreclosure in those

The scope of Section 7403(c),

Your Honor, does not make clear to me that the

government would take any more than what the life estate

owner had, and what the life estate owner had was merely

14

possession and the normal rights and duties attributable

15

to the life estate tenant during his lifetime, and since

16

the Ford Foundation in your case was the transferee of

17

the property before the time the tax lien arose, I would

say that all that the government gets in that case is

what the life estate owner had, and expires at his

death.

estates.

2

that the identity of the transferee makes any

difference, except in those instances where under state

law the transferor father might have some possibility of

5

reversion after the children expired, which of course is

6

theoretically possible.

7

nothing more than what the normal rights and duties of

the life estate tenant, and they expire at his death.
QUESTION;

11

question, because I didn’t understand your answer.

12

Assume a joint tenancy, an ordinary joint tenancy, no

13

homestead overlay, and one of the joint tenants is tax

14

delinquent.

15

there any provision of Texas law that prevents the

16

government from moving in and selling the delinquent

taxpayer's interest in the joint tenancy?

differs considerably from a joint tenancy or a tenancy

Justice.
I would like to say to the Court that Mr. Bill

8
9

Thank you, Your Honor, Mr. Chief

Elliott and I have conferred with regard to Justice

10

O'Connor's question regarding the effect of a divorce on

11

community property, and Mr. Bill Elliott agrees with me

12

that a divorce will — could affect a — the homestead

13

right of a party if in effect, as in this case, Donald

14

Ingram gave up his homestead right by conveying it to

15

his spouse, but a divorce as such does not per se affect

party disavows the homestead right.

2

Again, in this particular case, the author of

3

the opinion in the Fifth Circuit, Judge Jerry Williams,

4

was a Univarsity of Texas professor before he was

5

appointed to the bench, and taught real property, among

6

other courses there, and when he -- in his opinion he

7

describes the homestead right as being one that was

8

actually remanded to the district court for

9

determination of whether there was abandonment or not.

10

11

That was the decision in the Fifth Circuit.
It may be a question that, why did the

12

district court, the same judge, the Honorable William

13

Mac Taylor, heard both of these cases within a two

14

weeks' period of time, and had a different result.

15

granted the government's motion for summary judgment in

the one case, and the taxpayers or the non-taxpayer

spouse motion in the other case.

15
