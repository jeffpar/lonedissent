Thank you, Your Honor.

QUESTIONS

To avoid an interruption later on,

12

I could not put my finger on the date of the criminal

13

act that was charged in this case.

14

MR. GILLETTE*

15

was July the 7th, 1976.

16

The date of the criminal act

This case is before the Court on a writ of

17

certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the

18

Ninth Circuit.

19

Slappy’s 1976 California state convictions for rape,

20

forcible oral copulation, robbery, burglary, and false

21

imprisonment, because it concluded that his Sixth

22

Amendment right to counsel had been violated.

That court reversed Respondent Joseph

23

Me submit that the result is an unwarranted

24

expansion of the Sixth Amendment based in part upon a

25

misreading of the state trial record.

In addition, we

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

submit that the Ninth Circuit has unfairly criticized

2

the state trial judge for failing to conduct an inquiry

3

that was not reasonably required by the record before

4

it.

5

The facts of the crime can be quickly

6

summarized.

hr. Slappy first accosted the victim early

on the morning of July 7th,

San Francisco.

Slappy went to the apartment building where the victim

hr. Slappy

He was wearing a

Is there any challenge here to the

verdict as such?
MR. GILLETTE;

None, Your Honor.

There has

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

never been a challenge either in the California courts

2

or in the federal courts on habeas corpus that the

3

evidence was insufficient to support these convictions.

4

This is not a case where we are talking about the scales

5

of justice being poised between guilt or innocence.

6

Slappy is clearly guilty, and the only real issue is

7

whether he received a fair trial.

8

Mr.

Now, the more critical facts which pertain to

9

the issues before this Court are those which relate to

10

his relationship with the attorney who represented him

at trial.

13

appointed to represent Mr. Slappy.

At his initial arraignment in municipal

QUESTION;

And what was the date of that

arraignment?
MR. GILLETTE;

That arraignment — I don’t

17

know the precise date. Your Honor.

18

within a day or two of July the 7th.

19

QUESTION;

It would have been

Well, it seems to me that the

20

papers before us don't have anything about the date of

21

the arraignment, the preliminary hearing, the date of

22

Mr. Goldfine's hospitalization, all of which, it seems

23

to me, are somewhat pertinent.

24
25

MR. GILLETTE;

Well, the facts relating to the

crime and the time and that such were not initially

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

to the lower federal courts.

8

Mr. Goldfine*s hospitalization, the reason that is not

9

in the record is a point that I will get to in just a

10

moment, if I may.
Now, after the San Francisco Public Defender

11
12

was appointed to represent Mr. Slappy, he assigned

13

Harvey Goldfine to represent him, and Mr. Goldfine

14

conducted the preliminary examination, and he also

15

conducted what was later described as a voluminous

16

investigation.

17

case, and that was scheduled to begin on September the

18

23rd, 1976.

Mr. Goldfine was scheduled to try the

On September 17th, six days before trial, the

19

20

Friday before trial, the case was reassigned from Mr.

21

Goldfine to Bruce Hotchkiss, an equally experienced

22

senior trial deputy with the San Francisco Public

23

Defender.

24

Goldfine had been hospitalized with appendicitis.

25

The reason for the reassignment was that Mr.

Mr. Hotchkiss met briefly that day, on Friday,

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with Mr. Slappy and advised him of the reassignment.

2

met again with him briefly on Monday morning in court,

3

and then on Tuesday spent in excess of three hours with

4

him discussing the case, met with him again Wednesday

5

morning, again Wednesday afternoon.

On Thursday, September 23rd, in the morning, a

7

jury was selected and empaneled.

8

Slappy, out of the presence of the jury, complained to

9

the judge that in his opinion Mr. Hotchkiss had not had

10

an adequate opportunity to prepare.
QUESTIONS

12

13

That afternoon, Mr.

He believed —

At that point, had any evidence

come in?
MR. GILLETTE;

No, Your Honor, it had not, but

14

a jury had been empaneled, and at that point it may have

15

been necessary to delcare a mistrial rather than simply

16

a continuance, because jeopardy had —

Again, the record before us doesn't

MR. GILLETTE;

It does now, yes.

from the Ninth Circuit did not, but all of those facts

Mr. Stevens

No, they had not.

Had not?
No, they had not.

The jury was

8

empaneled in the morning, and prior to the beginning of

9

the afternoon session, at which time the prosecutor

10

would have begun his opening statement and begun to

11

present evidence, Mr. Slappy made this complaint,

20

He had had an opportunity to meet with Mr. Slappy.

21

of the case, says in passing, I was assigned the case

12

last Friday because Mr. Goldfine is in the hospital with

13

appendicitis.

14

On the second day of trial, Friday, the 24th

15

of September, Mr. Slappy interrupted Mr. Hotchkiss's

16

cross examination of the victim several times,

17

complaining about the manner in which the cross

18

examination was being conducted.

19

to were leading questions by Mr. Hotchkiss and attempts

20

to limit the witness's testimony.

21

Mr. Slappy that in fact that was a standard technique of

22

cross examination, and had often been found to be very

23

effective.

What he was objecting

Later, the judge told

I notice, counsel, and it may not

be terribly important, but in the appendix here, the

MR. GILLETTE!

Oh, yes, he did, Your Honor.

14

a recess in the middle of the morning of that second day

15

of trial, Mr. Slappy repeated the complaints he had made

16

the day before, and said, I don't think that this

17

attorney is prepared, and again, Mr. Hotchkiss fully

18

outlined his preparation, including the fact that he was

19

going to have three full days, not just the weekend, but

20

the additional day of Monday because of prior judicial

21

commitments by the court in which to discuss the case

described by the second trial judge as deliberately

he wants to testify, not unlike a tactic or a ploy he

had pulled in the first trial.

The Ninth Circuit disagreed, and in June of

10

1981, in an opinion filed by a three-judge panel of that

11

court, concluded that an essential element of the Sixth

12

Amendment right to counsel is the right to a meaningful

13

attorney-client relationship.

14

failure of the state trial judge to inquire into how

15

long Mr. Goldfine might be unavailable violated that

16

right, and it equated this failure to conduct the

17

inquiry with a violation of Slappy's Sixth Amendment

18

right to counsel.

It concluded that the

In our view, this extension, this expansion of

19

20

the Sixth Amendment is unwarranted and unnecessary, and

21

we suggest that it is based, at least in part, upon a

22

misreading of the trial record by the Ninth Circuit.
QUESTION:

25

Mr. Gillette, may I ask one

MR. GILLETTE:

QUESTION:

At the second trial, after the

2

mistrial on the two offenses, the judge there said he

3

thought that the respondent was uncooperative and

4

deliberately misbehaving.

5

SR. GILLETTE:

6

QUESTION:

Deliberately disruptive.

And then also in the Ninth Circuit,

7

after they issued their first opinion, they wrote a

8

second opinion in which they said at the time of the

9

continuance, which I guess was before the first trial,

10

they thought he was acting with sincerity and the state

11

didn’t disagree with that.

12
13

SR. GILLETTE:
but that's not true.
QUESTION:

15

Well, that's what they said,

That's what I wanted to ask you.

What is your -SR. GILLETTE:

16

The Ninth Circuit modified in

17

part its opinion in response to our petition for

18

rehearing and hearing en banc, saying in that amendment

that Slappy in their view was acting in good faith when

he asked to have Goldfine, and was not being disruptive

1

Slappy is a manipulative and disruptive defendant and

2

that his behavior from the beginning of the first trial

3

to the end of the second trial illustrates that.

4

Particularly in the first case, he consistently looked

5

for one way or another to try to stop the case or

6

disrupt it.

7

8
9
10

QUESTION*

So your position is, he was

uncooperative all the way through.
MR. GILLETTEs
QUESTIONS

Yes.

What about the first trial judge?

11

Did he say anything on that precise point, whether he

12

thought he was sincere or just disruptive?

13

MR. GILLETTEs

No, he did not.

He made

14

actually a great many efforts to try to get Mr. Slappy

15

to cooperate with the case, and on several occasions

16

when Slappy said, "I want to leave the courtroom, let me

17

out of here," the judge said, well, I think it is to

18

your advantage, please sit down and please remain, and

19

tried several times to discuss with him.

20

QUESTIONS

But your position, as I understand

21

it, just as one other question, is that even assuming he

22

was sincere all the way through, you don't think there

23

is this constitutional right to a meaningful

24

relationship with counsel.

25

MR. GILLETTE:

No.

We do not.

QUESTION;

You don't.

2

QUESTION;

Mr. Gillette, isn't it fair to

3

infer at least from some of the trial judge's comments

4

at the very end of the trial that he did think Mr.

Slappy was just making a record for an appeal?

Correct.

Nr. Gillette -Yes?

-- may I ask before you go on,

5

under your version, I suppose we could conclude that the

trial judge was correct in the first instance in

7

treating the comments of the defendant as, at best, a

8

motion for a continuance —

all to his first assigned attorney.

12

MB. GILLETTE:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Precisely.

Precisely.

And if we did that, we would never

reach this Sixth Amendment question, would we?
SB. GILLETTE:

No, I think not, and I can

16

address that right now, and I would like to, because it

17

is important to emphasize here that as the Ninth Circuit

18

saw it, the Sixth Amendment violation was not simply

19

that Mr. Hotchkiss rather than Mr. Goldfine represented

20

Slappy, but rather that the judge did not conduct the

21

inquiry, which in its view was required by the record.

22

Now, I think as far as determining whether the

23

state trial judge was obligated to conduct that inquiry,

24

one framework for analyzing that issue is to look at the

25

conflict of interest counsel cases which this Court has

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

derided over the last few years.

2

The first cf those cases was Holloway versus

3

Arkansas in 1978, in which it held that where you had

4

three defendants represented by a single public defender

5

who said that in his view there was a conflict of

6

interest, that the failure by the trial judge in that

7

case to respond to that request by the defense attorney,

8

coupled with the requests by the three individual

9

defendants for separate counsel, constituted a violation

10

of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, not just

11

because they had a single attorney, but because no

12

response was made to the requests for separate counsel.

13

Holloway was followed in 1980 by Cyler versus

14

Sullivan.

15

represented by the same two retained attorneys.

16

time during the state proceedings was there ever any

17

objection to this joint representation, nor did it

18

appear in the record that there ever was an actual

19

conflict of interest.

20

There you had three defendants, each
At no

In that case, the Court held that unless the

21

trial judge knew or reasonably should have known that

22

there was a conflict of interest, he was under no sui

23

sponte duty to conduct an inquiry into the possibility

24

of a conflict of interest.

25

Then, finally, in 1981, in Wood v. Georgia,

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Court found that where you had defendants, several

2

defendants represented by the same attorney who had been

3

hired by the defendants’ employer, and who appeared to

4

perhaps have a conflict of interest as between the

5

interests of the defendants and the interests of the

6

employer, that on those facts, the trial judge was

7

reasonably required to conduct an inquiry because he

a

reasonably should have known that there was a

9

possibility of a conflict of interest, and should have

10

determined whether it existed, and if so, whether that

11

conflict was waived by the defendants.

12

I think that on the facts of this case, we are

13

talking about a situation which is really much closer to

14

Cyler than it is either to Holloway or to Wood v.

15

Georgia.

16

objection by hr. Slappy, which was that he did not think

17

Hotchkiss was prepared.

18

by Hr. Slappy or any statement by Hr. Slappy that he

19

wanted Mr. Goldfine to represent him.

20

The trial judge was faced with a specific

He was not faced with a request

The only way that you can support the Ninth

21

Circuit's conclusion that an inquiry was required on

22

this record is if you agree with what I think is the

23

underlying assumption of the Ninth Circuit, which was

24

that when it became apparent to the judge, or when the

25

judge became aware through the statements of Hotchkiss

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that there had bean a substitution of one deputy public

2

defender for another deputy public defender, at that

3

moment, absent any objection from Mr. Slappy, the judge

4

was required to conduct the inquiry.

5

We submit that he was not, unless he knew or

6

reasonably should have known that Slappy was objecting

7

to that substitution, and there is nothing in this

8

record which suggests that he did.

9

obligation, we submit, on these facts, was to ensure

The judge's only

10

that Mr. Hotchkiss was prepared and was capable of

11

providing effective assistance of counsel because he had

12

enough time to read the record, to meet with his client,

13

and to prepare a defense.

14

I think that the Ninth Circuit opinion on

15

these facts really doesn't hold — well, what it really

16

holds is that a defendant has a right to continuous

17

representation, because it is going to obligate a trial

18

judge any time he is aware that there has been a

19

substitution of counsel to conduct that inquiry

20

regardless of any objection by the defendant.

21

Now, that brings me back to what the Sixth

22

Amendment held — excuse me, what the Ninth Circuit held

23

as an extension of the Sixth Amendment, namely, the

24

right to a meaningful attorney-client relationship.

25

Sixth Amendment, this Court has held, prohibits a trial

judge from arbitrarily interfering with the development

2

of the attorney-client relationship, from arbitrarily or

3

unnecessarily interfering with the ability of the

4

defense attorney to represent his client and meet with

5

his client.

6

a meaningful attorney-client relationship, for that can

7

occur only through the mutual cooperation of the

8

defendant and the attorney.

It does not, however, we submit, guarantee

9

If such a relationship fails to develop, that

10

is not a violation of the Sixth Amendment unless it can

11

be shown that there has been judicial interference with

12

the opportunity or ability of the attorney and the

13

defendant to develop that relationship.

14

have is a failure by a trial judge to conduct an inquiry

15

into the reasons why a public defender substituted one

16

trial deputy for another trial deputy, that is not the

17

type of interference which this Court has condemned and

18

which can be said to have interfered with the ability of

19

the defendant to be represented effectively by counsel

20

at trial.

21

Where all we

That, of course, is the key to all Sixth

22

Amendment cases, assuring that the defendant received

23

effective assistance of counsel, and a mere substitution

24

of one trial deputy from a public defender's office for

25

another trial deputy in and of itself is not the kind of

2

effective representation of the defendant or to

3

otherwise prejudice the defendant.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Gillette, may I ask you a

5

question?

You take the position here that the defendant

6

was effectively represented by counsel within the

7

meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

8

MR. GILLETTE:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, we do.

In your view, what is the correct

10

statement of the standard for determining whether there

11

was effective representation of counsel?

12

MR. GILLETTE:

The definition of effective

13

assistance of counsel as California has recently

14

formulated it, which was based in part on language in

15

some federal opinions, is that it must be shown, in

16

order to establish that counsel was not effective, the

17

defendant must show that he failed to act in a manner to

18

be expected of reasonably competent attorneys acting as

19

diligent advocates, and that that failure resulted in

20

the withdrawal of a potentially meritorious defense.

21

22

And you would consider that an

acceptable statement of the federal standard?
MR. GILLETTE:

effective assistance of counsel, that Mr. Slappy did

QUESTION*

Does a federal district court in

2

a habeas corpus proceeding have the right to set aside a

3

conviction because there was an abuse of discretion by

4

the state trial judge, if there was not an unfair

5

trial?

6

MR. BASSI*

The federal district court does as

7

it impacts upon the right to counsel.

The right to

8

counsel is fundamental and essential to a fair trial.

9

There seems to be two strains in the federal cases which

10

indicate that, and I would cite Avery, for example, as

11

one strain, indicating that the courts have recognized

12

that a request for a continuance would necessarily have

13

some impact upon a fair and impartial trial.

14

There are other cases, and I would cite Burton

15

and Gandy, that recognize that the impact of a request

16

for a continuance affects the right to counsel.

17

and Gandy never reached the issue of whether or not the

18

court would have to reverse on the issue of right to

19

counsel; rather, decided the case on fair trial.

Burton

20

The more recent cases of Laura, which is out

21

of the Third Circuit, and Linton v. Perini, out of the

22

Sixth Circuit, definitely discuss the issue of a

23

continuance and abuse of discretion by the trial court

24

definitely impacting upon the right to counsel rather

25

than on the fair trial side of the train of thought in

there had been a colloquy

Is it the custom of the public

most of the legwork in investigations done by actual

HR. BASSI;

Or is there —

I think the — They have an

understaffed, actually, and I think if the work can be

done by an investigator, it is, but I think generally

the lawyer goes out and takes a look at the scene, and

21

will try and talk to witnesses if he can.

the Sixth Amendment in providing assistance to the

defendant to meet the intricacies of the law and in

6

meeting the advocacy of the public prosecutor mandate

7

that there must be some nexus between the effectiveness

8

of counsel and the providing of an attorney.

The interests of

Powell v. Alabama recognized that there must

9
10

be more than just an attorney provided at the last

11

minute.

There must be investigation —
2UESTI0N:

12

Well, now, the Powell case involved

13

appointment of the entire bar of the county, and that

14

has never been done since, has it?
MR. BASSIi

15

No, it hasn’t, Your Honor.

But

16

part of the reasoning behind Powell in my understanding

17

is that the last minute appointment prevented any

18

investigation, communication, or interaction between the

19

defendants and the attorneys appointed to represent

20

them.
20ESTI0Ni

21

Well, do you suggest that here

22

there was a last minute appointment, or that there was a

lack of opportunity to investigate and prepare, on this

MR. BASSIi

I submit that there was a last

Well, you link, that just to this

meaningful relationship concept.

5

MR. BASSI:

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. BASSI:

Yes.
Not to the effective assistance.
No, we are not arguing effective

8

assistance, because we don't feel that the record is —

9

first of all, that the Court has to reach this issue.

10

QUESTION;

Well, if a court finds that a

11

client was afforded effective assistance of counsel,

12

could he nonetheless seek, habeas relief on the grounds

13

that although his assistance was effective, he didn't

14

have a meaningful relationship with his attorney?

15

MR. BASSI;

If the trial judge were to make an

16

adequate inquiry, and in finding in the exercise of

17

discretion that there would be some prejudice to the

18

relationship between the client and the attorney, but on

19

the other side found a legitimate need to move the case

20

towards trial and did so, then I suggest that prejudice

21

to the defendant does not override an adequate exercise

22

of discretion by the trial judge.

23
24
25

What is essential, though, is that there be an
adequate, an adequate exercise of discretion.
QUESTION:

Well, supposing you ware back in

40

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Ninth Circuit arguing this case on appeal, as I

2

understand you did, and you concluded the part of your

3

argument devoted to effective assistance of counsel.

4

Let's assume you made one.

5

say, well, we think this man received effective

6

assistance of counsel.

7

say?

8

out that even if you think, he got effective assistance

9

of counsel, I want to raise the point that he didn't

10

And the three judges there

Now, what else have you got to

And then you go on and say, well, I want to point

have a meaningful relationship with his counsel.

11

Now, do you think that is a separate point

12

that the Ninth Circuit or any other court should

13

consider after finding that he had effective assistance

14

of counsel?
MR. BASSI:

15

Yes.

The cases indicate, and I

16

cite Burton, for example, that the courts have

17

considered both the right to counsel and effective

18

assistance of counsel as two separate issues, and that

19

while interrelated, they necessarily are separate in the

20

analysis of whether or not effective assistance has been

21

provided.

22

In response to your question, would the habeas

23

corpus apply to effective assistance, yes, it would, but

24

under the full and fair trial doctrine, I submit that

25

the right to counsel should be analyzed under the

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

investigation is needed.
MR. BASSI*

Would that be satisfactory?

If the judge held -- yes, it

would, if the judge completely exercised discretion.

Well, then, let me read to you.

relationship."

And —

QUESTION;

10

What if you had the leading defense

11

counsel at the San Francisco bar appointed to represent

12

a defendant, and he had done all of the investigating

13

that any lawyer would have done, but on the first day of

14

trial the defendant said, judge, I just don’t trust this

15

fellow, and I don't have a meaningful relation with

16

him ?

17
18
19

MR. BASSI;

I think that is one aspect in the

exercise of discretion that the court must look to.
QUESTION;

Do you think even in those

20

circumstances there would be any right to have the

21

second leading lawyer in San Francisco represent him?

22

MR. BASSI;

If the court properly exercised

23

discretion and found no legitimate -- and found there

24

was a legitimate interest in going to trial for the

25

prosecution, than the court is fully within its

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

discretion to order the defendant to continue to trial

2

with the first attorney or by himself.

3

not that the defendant conclusively binds the trial

4

judge, but that the trial judge exercise his discretion

5

by fully looking at the issue.
QUESTION*

The Key here is

I submit —

Isn’t there always a legitimate

interest on the part of the prosecution in going to

The burden is always on the

person who wants to postpone the trial in that

situation, whether it is a defendant or a prosecutor, I

12

would think.

13

NR. BASSI*

There is always a legitimate

14

interest the prosecutor can set forth in going to trial,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

precise formulations that the Ninth Circuit would have

MR. BASSIs

When it impacts upon the right to

QUESTION;

Do you think this was rational

conduct on his part?

is necessary for a defendant to assert his

He tried on the first day of t rial, and

It is clear that in the — in the original

motion for the continuance and request for specific

counsel, that his attorney completely ignor ed his

18

request, asserting that he was ready to go to trial, and

19

at that point the indigent was effectively pro se and

20

without counsel.

21

The important point that we would like to

22

stress in this case is that the defendant's objection

23

does not conclusively bind the trial court, that if the

24

trial court properly exercises discretion, even if it is

25

prejudicial to the defendant to remove coun sel or to go

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to trial or have the defendant go to trial pro se, the

2

trial court can properly make that determination/ but

3

only after it fully exercises discretion.
The case which Kr. Gillette cited, Holloway,

4
5

we feel is the most similar to this case, not whether

6

the defendant had a fair trial, but whether the trial

7

court’s exercise of discretion or failure to do so

8

impacted on his right to counsel.

9

issue between effectiveness of counsel and identity of

We submit that the

10

counsel is often difficult to draw, but Slappy's

11

objections in this case go more to the identity of his

12

counsel rather than the sufficiency of counsel’s

13

preparation and the effectiveness of Hotchkiss at the

14

trial.

15

Per se reversal is the appropriate standard

16

whan the right to counsel is interfered with.

The

17

interests of providing per se reversal, and I think it

18

is demonstrated by the conflicting opinions in the

19

circuits, are that you can have an evenhanded

20

application of the rule for right to counsel.

21

case is analyzed in terms of effective assistance of

22

counsel or an abuse of discretion resulting in the

23

denial of a fair trial, you find conflicting opinions,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANE R. GILLETTE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

MR. GILLETTE*

7

it please the Court.

8

would like to make.

9

Yes, I do. Your Honor, and may

I have just a couple of points I

What we see as one of the critical

10

difficulties with this Ninth Circuit opinion was

11

suggested by the guestioning of Mr. Justice Rehnguist

12

and Mr. Justice Powell, and that is that carried to its

13

logical extreme, the Ninth Circuit opinion would permit

14

an indigent defendant or any defendant to seek federal

15

habeas corpus relief solely on the grounds that he did

16

not have what he perceived to be a meaningful

17

attorney-client relationship with the attorney who

18

represented him at trial.

19

What it does is to transfer the Sixth

20

Amendment determination of whether the Sixth Amendment

21

has been satisfied from whether he had an attorney to

22

whether he had an attorney that he liked.

23

subjective test, and that simply is not the obligation

24

under the Sixth Amendment.

25

He must have an attorney who was individually

It makes it a

He must have an attorney.

responsible to his undivided interests, and whose

2

actions are independent of the public defen der or the

3

government agency which funds that office.

4

But the mere fact that he says, I didn't like

5

him, or I couldn't get along with him, stan ding alone,

6

cannot establish a violation of the Sixth A mendment.

7

Now, Mr. Bassi has suggested that what Mr.

8

Slappy was trying to do here was simply say in the best

9

way he could what he really wanted, which w as to have

10

Goldfine.

11

represent him, it took no sophistication, n o great feat

12

of art for him to say, I want Mr. Goldfine.

13

on that first day of trial, when Mr. Hotchk iss told the

14

judge, I was reassigned to the case because Mr. Goldfine

15

is in the hospital, Slappy said nothing.

16

If what he wanted was to have Mr . Goldfine

QUESTION:

Even when

Well, but you would be arguing

17

roughly the same thing if that is what he h ad said, and

18

the judge said, you are not entitled to him

I

19

MR. GILLETTE:

20

QUESTION:

•

I am sorry, Your H onor ?

You would be arguing a Imost the

21

same thing if he had said, I want Goldfine, and the

22

judge had said, sorry, you have to be satis fied with

23

this very competent substitute.

24
25

MR. GILLETTE:

That’s correct.

0 ur position

is that, first, that the judge had no duty to inquire on

53
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this rs;ori, but that even if there had been a request/

2

or you can infer a request, the judge's only obligation

3

was to ensure that the public defender who was assigned

4

and who was present at trial had the opportunity to

5

prepare, had access to the record, had an opportunity to

6

meet with his client, and was ready to proceed.

7

Kr. Hotchkiss had an obligation when asked by

8

the trial judge if he was ready to proceed to say, yes,

9

he was, if in fact he was ready .

10
11

He had an obligation

as an officer of the court not to mislead the judge.
The final point T want to make here is that

12

what really happened, what is really happening in this

13

case is that I think the Ninth Circuit has once again,

14

unfortunately, confused its power to have supervisory

15

control over the federal trial courts with its

16

responsibility in cases of habeas corpus not to set

17

aside state convictions unless there has been a

18

constitutional violation.

19

If the Ninth Circuit wants to say that

20

defendants who are represented by — who are being tried

21

in federal district court and are being represented by

22

federal public defenders have these kinds of rights,

23

that is fine.

24

supervisory power.

25

Amendment which compels it as an aspect of the Sixth

They can do that.

They have that

Amendment, and because of that, we submit the Ninth

2

Circuit's decision was incorrect, and again, we ask this

3

Court to reverse it.
