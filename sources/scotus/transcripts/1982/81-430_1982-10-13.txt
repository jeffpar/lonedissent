CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES:

We will hear arguments

3 first this morning in Illinois against Gates.

Mr.

4 Biebel,

I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL P. BIEBEL, JR., Esg.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. BEIBEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court:
9

This is a search and seizure case.

It

10 involves the question of whether or not probable cause

11

for the establishment of a search warrant can be

12 established

where an anonymous letter is sent to a

13 police department and many of the items of that
14 anonymous letter are then corroborated by the police.
15

Here, pursuant to a search warrant, the car

16 and the apartment of Lance and Susan Gates were searched
17 and large quantities of drugs were seized.

However, a

18 motion to suppress was granted by the trial court,
19 DuPage County,

Illinois.

That suppression was affirmed

20 by the Appellate Court of Illinois and affirmed once
21

again by the Supreme Court of Illinois.

Certiorari was

22 granted by this Court.
23

The pertinent facts are these.

24 1978, the Bloomingdale,

On May 3rd,

Illinois Police Department

25 received an anonymous letter which was postmarked May

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2nd, 1978.

That letter said that there was a couple

2 living in Bloomingdale, Lance and Sue Gates, who lived
3

on Greenway in the condominiums who made their living

4

off drugs.

5

were done in Florida.

Most of their buys, according to the letter,
Sue would drive a car down to

6 Florida; Lance would fly down later and drive the car
7

back.
The latter specifically stated that on May

8
9

3rd, Sue would be driving down to Florida and Lance

10

would be flying down a couple of days later to drive the

11

car back.

The letter stated that the car would contain

12 $100,000 worth of drugs in the trunk, and that there are
13

about $100,000 worth of drugs in the couple’s apartment

14

in the basement.

15

Further, the letter said that the Gates brag

16

about the fact that they don’t have to work and that

17

they make their money off pushers.

18

indicated that the Gates's were friends with drug

19

dealers who visit their house often.

Finally, they

20

Upon receipt of this letter on May 3rd, 1978,

21

the case was assigned to Detective Charles Mader of the

22 Bloomingdale Police Department who did several things to
23

check whether or not this letter was accurate.

24

all, he checked with the Illinois Secretary of State to'

25

ascertain whether anybody with a driver's license by the

First of

name of Gates lived in Bloomingdale, and he checked and

2 he found out that, indeed, a Lance Gates lived in
3

Bloomingdale; however, he lived on Dartmouth Avenue,

4

which was different from the letter.

5

The Secretary of State provided a description

6 of Mr. Gates.
7

He was a male, white, born in 1947, brown

eyes, brown hair, five feet, eleven, 220 pounds.

8

Because of the discrepancy in the information

9

of the Secretary of State, Detective Mader went further

10

and checked with an anonymous informant who had provided

11

reliable information in the past, which gave him

12

information from financial records which his informant

13

had which indicated that Mr. Gates lived on Greenway,

14

which was consistent with the letter, and that his prior

15

address was on Dartmouth, which would indicate that he

16

had let his driver’s license, in effect — he didn’t

17

follow it up with the new address.

18
19

Detective Mader then went and checked with the
Chicago Police Department who has responsibility for

20 O'Hare field and ascertained that an L.
21

to go out on Flight 245 on Eastern Airlines to Atlanta

22 and West Palm Beach, Florida at

4:15 on May 5th, which

23

would be consistent with the letter.

24

given for L. Gates, who had registered.

25

Gates was slated

A phone number was

Detective Mader then contacted the security

1

office of the Illinois Bell Telephone Company and found

2 out that that phone number was an unlisted number to
3

Lance Gates who lived on Greenway Drive in Bloomingdale,

4

Illinois.
Detective Wader then checked with the Drug

5

6 Enforcement Administration, and they had an agent out at
7

O’Hare field waiting to watch the people get on Flight

8 245.
9

A man identifying himself as Lance Gates and

meeting the description got on that plane.

Drug

10

Enforcement agents were in Florida when that plane

11

landed and they watched Mr. Gate get off the plane, they

12

watched him stay at the airport for about an hour, and

13

then they observed that he took a cab directly to the

14

West Palm Beach Holiday Inn.

15

the room, registered to Susan Gates.

16

He was observed entering

The record will not reflect what time he

17

arrived, but it had to be about 8:00 o'clock,

18

considering the lapse in time and the delay of an hour

19

in the airport.

20

Within 12 hours, at 7:00 o'clock the next

21

morning, Mr. Gates and an unidentified female left,

22 checked out, got into an automobile with license plates
23

registered to Lance Gates and headed back on the

24

interstate, presumably towards Chicago.

25

license plates indicated that the plates were registered

A check of the

to a car other than being driven in this case.

2

It «as estimated by the drug agents that the

3

driving time from West Palm Beach, Florida to

4

Bloomingdale, Illinois was about 21 to 23 hours.

5

this was May 6th in the morning.

6

In the evening of May 6th, which was a

7

Saturday, Detective Mader went and presented his

Now,

8 information to a judge who issued a search warrant for
9

the car and for the apartment based on the anonymous

10

letter and the corroboration of the letter.

The search

11

warrant was executed at 5*14 the next morning, which was

12

some 23 hours after the Gates’s had left Florida, which

13

would indicate virtually a non-stop trip.

14

In the trunk of the automobile were several

15

large bundles of marijuana weighing about 350 pounds.

16

search of their residence uncovered more marijuana,

17

weapons, ammunition, drug paraphernalia, several scales

18

presumably for the weighing of the drugs.

19

also had cocaine in their possession.

The couple

20

Both were indicted for unlawful possession of

21

cannabis with intent to deliver and unlawful possession

22 of a controlled substance, and Lance Gates was
23

separately indicted for possession of an unlicensed

24

fir earm.

25

However, a motion to suppress was granted by

A

1

the Circuit Court of DuPage County, Illinois by Judge

2 William Hopf who indicated that neither prong of the
3 Aguilar or Spinelli test were met here.

There was no

4 indication in the letter of the basis of the knowledge
5 of the letter writer, and there was nothing to
6 substantiate his reliability.
7

That was affirmed by the Appellate Court of

8 Illinois Section District in 1980 where that court,
9 admittedly disagreeing with several state and federal
10 cases, held that corroboration by the police can only be
11

used to satisfy the veracity pring of Aguilar and

12 Spinelli and cannot be used to satisfy the basis of
13 knowledge prong.

And since there was no basis of

14 knowledge indicated, -15

QUESTIONS

17

Counsel, where did all this prong

Is that in Aguilar itself?

MR. BEIBELs

Aguilar just set out at the end

18 of the opinion the two steps that have to be utilized
19 when informants are used.

I think it was explicated in

20 the Spinelli case, and certainly there's been a great
21 deal of comment by courts and a Law Review article since
22 about the two-prong test and how it’s described.
23

QUESTION:

You think Aguilar and Spinelli

24 intended to cover the whole waterfront insofar as
25 probable cause and warrants —

1

SR. BEIBELs

We would certainly contend not

2 so, Your Honor, and that's the basis of our case here.
3

If Aguilar and Spinelli — we would argue that Aguilar

4

and Spinelli ought to be carefully re-examined by this

5

Court in view of the fact that it's overly formalistic

6 and it's confused courts and police officers and
7

prosecutors.
But beyond that, I don't think that Aguilar

8
9

and Spinelli was meant to apply to a situation such as

10

here where you have an anonymous letter writer who

11

volunteers information.

12

iifference between that and a police informant where

13

there may well be ulterior motives by a police informant

14

to lie.

15

I think there's a distinct

The Appellate Court of Illinois, taking this

16

formalistic approach, said we're sorry, but the

17

corroboration of the police can only go to veracity and

18

it can’t go to the basis of knowledge.

19

wasn't any facial indication of basis of knowledge on

And so there

20 the affidavit for a search warrant; it had to fall.
21

The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the

22 appellate court but didn't go guite as far.

In an

23

opinion by Hr. Justice Ward over dissents by Hr.

24

Justices Horan and Underwood, they held that neither

25

prong was met.

They didn’t feel that the corroboration

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in this case of what they described as clearly innocent

2 activity was sufficient to meet either prong.

However,

3

they didn't get to the question of whether or not

4

corroboration can be used to supply the basis of

5

knowledge prong.
The dissents, however, said in that case that

6
7

every detail of the letter was corroborated, like Draper

8 versus the United States, and consequently, both prongs
9

were satisfied and probable cause was properly granted.
It is our contention in this case, Your

10
11

Honors, that probable cause here for the issuance of a

12

search warrant was properly shown.

13

standards enunciated by this Court in cases such as

14

Draper, Brinegar, Carroll, is whether the facts and

15

circumstances are such as to warrant a reasonably

16

prudent man to believe that a crime has been committed.

17

And when search warrants are involved, the question is

18

whether or not the items are probably present in their

19

location.
Since probable cause requires less evidence

20
21

The probable cause

than is required to justify conviction, hearsay can be

22 used to establish probable cause as long as there is a
23

substantial basis for crediting the hearsay, as this

24

Court has enunciated in Jones, Rugendorf , Harris and the

25

like.

I

1

Here, the hearsay evidence supplied by the

2 anonymous letter writer, coupled by the cor roboration of
3

the police of the details of the letter, we re sufficient

4

to warrant a reasonably prudent man in beli eving that

5

the drugs were probably located where the a nonymous

6 letter writer said they were.
7

This letter described a

classic drug run rather than an ordinary so cial or

8 business trip.

And the predictions of the letter are

9 exactly what occurred
Lance Gates flew down to Florida, a place that

10
11

the Drug Enforcement Administration has ide ntified as a

12

major port of entry of illegal narcotics in to the United

13

States; a point that this Court can take ju dicial

14

knowledge of, as it did in Carroll with the role that

15

Detroit played with regard to illegal liquo r during

16

prohibition.
He stayed less than 12 hours in Florida,

17
18

turned around in the automobile that his wife apparently

19

had brought down there and drove back virtually non-stop

20 to Bloomingdale, Illinois, arriving at his apartment in
21

the early morning hours of a Sunday.

The letter was

22 correct, therefore, not only in its conclusion that the
23

Gates were running drugs, but also in the specifics of

24

the trip.

25

Now, the Supreme Court of Illinois has gone

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

off and said that this was clearly innocent activity.

2 We would like to note that that should not make a
3

difference as long as that activity, along with the tip

4

itself, is enough to supply probable cause.

5

in the Draper case which I'll make reference to in a

Certainly,

6 minute, you had clearly innocent activity which,
7

combined with a tip, was judged to be enough for

8 probable cause.
9

Furthermore, there is an absence of an

10

apparent motive to lie in this case.

11

informants who are often either paid or receive some

12

sort of leniency or protection or perhaps pressure to

13

produce information by the police, there are oftentimes

14

those pressures to lie.

15

With police

Here, the anonymous letter, however,

16

volunteered the information.

And therefore, it should

17

be given credence like a citizen informant and presumed

18

to be credible.

19

the letter which indicated specifically the time that

Consequently, because of the detail of

20 they would go down to Florida and how they would come
21

back, which proved to be true, because of the absence of

22 an apparent motive to lie, because of the extensive
23

police corroboration in this case which took in three

24

police departments, post office, financial records,

25

because of the inherently suspicious nature of the trip,

6

NR. BEIBEL*

7 taken together,

It occurred in Nay, Judge.

All

all these factors taken together we

8 believe amply justify the judge’s determina tin of
9 probable cause, particularly when you view that
10 preference ought to be given to search warrants as
11

opposed to warrantless searches, as this Court has often

12

said in cases such as Ventresca.

13

I might note that probable cause has been

14 found by this Court in cases with less evidence than
15 presented here.
16 this Court,

In Adams versus Williams, an opinion of

1972, a policeman in Bridgeport, Connecticut

17 in the early morning hours was told by an informant, who
18 had only given information on one prior occasion and
19 that had to do with

alleged homosexual activity in a

20 railroad station which did not result in any arrest
21

because it had been unsubstantiated — that person told

22 the police officer that the defendant was sitting in a
23 specific location in an automobile;

that he had a gun in

24 his waist and that there were substantial amounts of
25 drugs in the car.

13

On the basis of this, he

and found heroin -- substantial amounts of

both on his person and in the car.
This Court, in an opinion by Hr. Justice

11

that when we're dealing with probable

cause we're dealing with probabilities; we’re not

12 dealing with technicalities.

And since the gun was

precisely where the informant said it would be,

14 then it predicted

-- was reasonable to corroborate the

15 reliability

of the informant that drugs would be in the

16 car as well

as the gun in the man's waistband.

The theory of Adams was premised upon Draper

17
18 versus the

United States where a reliable informant

19 precisely described

the attire that Hr. Draper would be

20 wearing, that he would be carrying a tan zippered bag
21

and that ha would be walking quickly.

Draper would be getting off a train from

2 walking quickly.

On the basis of that information, they

3

stopped the man, they searched him without a warrant and

4

they found three ounces of heroin on him, as the

5

informant said they would.
This Court found there was probable cause in

6
7

that case because the preciseness of the description in

8 Draper gave support to the truthfulness of the statement
9

that Draper was carrying heroin.
We contend that this case is stronger than

10
11

either Adams or Draper because here there was extensive

12

police corroboration of activity that was less innocent

13

than either Adams or Draper.

Here we have all the earmarks of a trip to

16
17

obtain drugs.

Lance Sates flew down to Florida, stayed

18

12 hours, drove his car non-stop back to B1oomingdale,

19

Illinois.

Because the anonymous letter writer in our

20 case was precisely correct in the way the trip would go
21

down, in the days — concerning the days that the trip

22 would taka,

it was, we believe, a justifiable decision

23

by the court that this would indicate that the further

24

allegations of the anonymous letter were true, too, and

25

that is that they were carrying drugs.

And, in fact,

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that was the case
Probable cause should therefore be granted in

this case, as it was in Adams, as it was in Draper,

4

which I said were both warrantless cases.

5

question in favor or not in favor of a case if a warrant

If there is a

6 has been issued, then preference ought to be given to
7

the warrant.

8

However, the difficulty arises in cases such

9

as this because of the application by the lower courts

10

of the two-prong Aguilar and Spinelli test to a

11

situation involving other than a police informant.

12

we have an anonymous letter writer.

13

Here

Because a hearsay declaration is unknown to a

14

magistrate or a judge who is required to determine

15

probable cause for a warrant, the two-prong test was

16

established to require police to state to the judge

17

first of all, the basis for why they believe that the

18

informant has veracity, and secondly, what information

19

the informant has to indicate that he believes that a

20 crime has been committed.
21

But according to some courts, including the

22 Appellate Court of Illinois in this case, when
23

information comes from other than a police informant —

24

in this case, an anonymous letter writer, volunteering

25

information — the information is per se defective if

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

there are not enough — there isn’t a basis for the

2 knowledge facially indicated on the request for a
3

warrant or on the letter, and there are not enough facts

4

to permit self-verification, as this Court utilized in

5

the Spinelli case.
The appellate court citing Judge Moilan, who

6
7

is often cited in this area in his case, Stanley versus

8 the State, an intermediate appellate court in Maryland,
9

1974 opinion, that police corroboration, though relevant

10

in determining veracity, cannot be used to satisfy the

11

basis of knowledge prong.
We respectfully contend that that conclusion

12
13

finds no support in the opinions of this Court.

It

14

reduces the standards of determining probable cause to

15

ones of form over substance.

16

the mandate of this Court in Ventresca that Fourth

17

Amendment issues ought to be considered in a common

18

sense fashion rather than an over-formalistic fashion

19

because search warrants, requests for search warrants

And furthermore, it avoids

20 are often drafted by non-lawyers in the midst and in the
21

hiatus of criminal investigations, which is just exactly

22 what occurred here.

The police really had a very short

23

time in order to whether or not this information was

24

reliable.

25

We find it ironic that under the appellate

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

court opinion, which has accepted the Koilan theory,

2 that a basis for knowledge can be obtained by
3 non-corroborated statements in

a letter, but cannot be

4 supplied by the kind of extensive corroboration seen in
5 this case.

If the appellate court theory is maintained

6
7 here,

then an anonymous letter which does not supply

8 sufficient facts to indicate a basis of knowledge can
9 never be utilized for the determination of probable
10 cause because the corroboration by the police simply
11

can't be used to bolster the basis of knowledge prong.
It simply defies common sense, because

12

13 corroboration can be utilized not only to show the
14 veracity of

a declarant, — and certainly this Court has

15 said that -- but also to indicate that there are enough
16 verified facts to justify a

finding that the letter was

17 not based on conjecture or on rumor.

In the Draper case, certainly, the

18

19 self-verifying facts only became verified because the
20 police corroborated
21

what occurred.

They saw that the

man had the same clothing as the informant said, that he

22 was carrying a bag as the informant said,

and that he

23 would be walking guickly.

2 the warrant that authorized the search of the car, which
3 I guess was done immediately when it returned, and the
4 portion of the warrant that authorized the search of the
5 apartment?

MR. BEIBEL*

I don't think so.

I think if you

7 take the -8

QUESTION*

What is the corroboration of the

9 fact that -- I understand all your theory on the
10 corroboration of what was in the trunk of the vehicle,
11 which presumably was sent down to get back up there.
12 But what other than the information in the letter itself
13 supported the view that there was something to be found
14 in the apartment?
15

MR. BEIBEL*

The letter said that there were

16 $100,000 worth of drugs in the car as well —
17

QUESTION*

Right.

Was there any corroboration

18 of that?
19

MR. BEIBEL*

No.

I think the corroboration

20 simply has to do with the kind of drug trip that was
21 taken and it's reasonable for a judge to take the
22 further step and say they’ve got them in the car, and
23 they have them, as the declarant says, in the apartment
24 as well .
25

QUESTION:

But do you presume that -- on a

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

drug trip like this — that the stuff would always be

2 placed in the apartment of the driver?
3

5

Is that what you

assume?
MR. BEIBEL:

I don't think you can make that

presumption prticularly, but when it is alleged in the

6 letter and when the letter proves to be true in every
7

basic aspect, then I think that the judge can together

8 indicate that there is probable cause.

The tip and the

corroboration.
QUESTION:

You would not think your case was

11 any stronger on the car part than on the house part, is
12
13

what I'm after.
MR. BEIBEL:

I think the case is probably

14

stronger on the car part, certainly, because they drove

15

the car and there was more in the letter about the car

16

than the apartment, but I would say that the same theory

17

would hold true --

21

QUESTION:

And they were apprehended just as

they arrived back, weren't they?
MR. BEIBEL:

They were waiting for them when

they arrived at 5:15 in the morning.

22

I might note that this two-pronged test has

23

caused severe problems for other courts who have been

24

required to consider it when there haven't been the

25

traditional police informant cases.

The United States versus Bell, for example,

2 cited at page 19 of our brief involved a situation where

3 an arrest warrant was quashed because the supporting
4 affidavit did not attest to the credibility and
5 reliability of the eyewitness in that case.

The

6 eyewitness.

The Fifth Circuit, however, reversed and said
that Aguilar and Spinelli was not meant to pertain to

9 situations like this and should be limited to police
10 informants only.
11

Similarly, in United States versus Burke that

12 is cited in our brief,

the Second Circuit noted that

13 there’s been a gro wing recognition that the two-pronged
14 test ought to be a ddressed to professional informants
15 and should not be applied in a wooden fashion to citizen
16 informants such as witnesses or as victims.

Now, the magistrate knows him as an

24 honest officer who always tells the truth, and he knows

QUESTION;

You said that both prongs of

Aguilar shouldn’t apply in certain circumstances.

15

Neither one of them should apply in certain

circumstances.
MR. BEIBEL;

17

What I am simply saying is that I

18

think, the two-pronged test gets overly formalistic, and

19

what you ought to do is you ought to take the tip that's

20 involved -- and in this instance we have a tip from an
21

anonymous informant and not a police informant.

When

22 there's a police informant, the police have, it seems to

that there must be some basis for the person’s assertion

MR. BEIBEL:

No, I’m saying that in a

situation that in this case, as the appellate court did,

they said there is no showing of a basis for belief.

I know, but you think there should

be a showing of the basis, and that that requirement was

satisfied in this case.

MR. BEIBEL:

I think that what we’re moving

20 to, and you can see it in our brief and the Solicitor’s

brief, you will see, I think you get caught up in the

22 really confusing aspects of two prongs;

Hr. Reilley.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. REILLEY, Esq.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. REILLEY:

Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice,

22 and may it please the Court:
23

This case involves the question of whether the

24

search warrant naming the defendants, their home and an

25

automobile, based upon an anonymous letter and absent

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

any exigent circa.nstances, with no police observations

2 of any criminal activity, informed the issuing
3 magistrate of some of the underlying circum stances from
4 which the anonymous tipster concluded that the narcotics
5 were where he or she claimed they were, and some of the
6 underlying circumstances

from which the magistrate could

7 have concluded that the tipster, whose identity was
8 unknown,

was credible or his information reliable.
I start off, if I may, with that statement and

9

10 couch it in
11

the terms of the Aguilar case because I

believe in our opinion, our feelings and our theory from

12 the trial court up until today have been the same.

We

13 have read the opinions of this Court in Aguilar and
14 Spinelli.

We have postulated them to both the trial

15 judge, the Illinois Appellate Court and the Illinois
16 Supreme Court.
17

QUESTION;

Have you read Draper?

18

MR. REILLEY:

Yes, Your Honor, I intend to

19 discuss Draper and compare it to the facts of this case,
20 Your Honor.
21

The test, as I have indicated --

22

QUESTION;

Do you think that the Draper

23 provides an alternative approach to probable cause for
24 search warrants?
25

MR. REILLEY;

Yes, Your Honor, it does provide

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

an alternative approach, if I may, with regard to the

2 facts of this case.

As stated in Spinelli, Draper was a

3

suitable benchmark for a comparison in terms of the

4

two-prongei or two-basis test.
In Draper, however, we had, as the court

5

6 stated,
7

a reliable informant with a past track record,

compared to the Sates case, there was an anonymous

8 letter which I described as written in the third
9

person.

The letter writer stated facts and conclusions,

10

talked about the trip to Florida on May 3rd by Mrs.

11

Gates, talked about him flying down, and was incorrect

12 in terms of the corroboration that my opponent suggests
13

because the letter writer, the anonymous tipster, said

14

she would fly down -- or drive down, rather, leave the

15

car to be loaded with drugs and fly back immediately.
When the police, the DEA, watched Susan Gates

16
17

into the room, they saw her get into the car with Mr.

18

Gates the next morning, contrary to what the letter

19

writer said.

The letter write said she'd leave the car

20 and fly back immediately; contrary to that, she got in
21

22

the car.
QUESTION;

Well, Draper involved one small

23

inaccuracy on the part of the informer, too.

24

a day off on the day that Draper would arrive in the

25

Denver station?

Wasn't he

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MB. REILLEY :

I believe, if I recall, Your

2 Honor, he said that Draper would be returning to Denver
3 on either September 8th or 9th in that case, and it was,
4 in fact, the 9th.
5

I believe he gave an alternative date.

QUESTION:

Did the alternative — the informer

6 give an alternative?
7

MR. REILLEY:

Yes, he did.

And he did

8 describe the physical description of Draper.

In

9 addition, the informant, whose name was Hereford, was
10 named by the court, by the officer in his testimony.
11

QUESTION:

Supposing that you were, say, a

12 police sergeant or a magistrate, rather than an
13 attorney, and this case were presented to you on its
14 facts not at the present time, but supposing that
15 another informant turns up at a later date and it turns
16 out to be the same as this — the same parson as wrote
17 this anonymous letter.

would you say that this

18 anonymous letter gave reason for thinking that the
19 informant was a credible one, a second time around?
20

MR. REILLEY:

Is your question that we now

21 find the person who wrote the letter?
22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

MR. REILLEY:

And we're trying to back up what

24 he said by what was said in the letter?
25

QUESTION:

Yes.

Can you say that he gave you

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

previous credible information by virtue of what he did

2 in this case?

SR. REILLEY;

3

4 not, only based

No, sir, I would have to say

upon the content of the latter.

The

5 letter itself does not express where the letter writer
6 — even if we know who it is -- obtained his information.

QUESTION;

7

Well, does that really make sense?

8 My own personal -- if this isn't probable cause,
9 saw probable cause.
10 back to the
11

I never

find it seems to me that if you go

terms of the Constitution and talk about

reasonable searches and that sort of thing, no one in

12 their right mind would conclude that this was not a
13 reasonable action on

the part of the police.

MR. REILLEY:

14

15 is specifically this.

My answer to that. Your Honor,
That this Court has said that the

16 probable cause standard for a search warrant,

now, for a

17 search warrant as opposed to an emergency on the street
18 as in Adams versus Williams where there was perhaps a
19 danger to the police officer or to society because of a
20 gun.
21

Specifically, this Court said that hearsay can now

be the basis for a search warrant, as opposed to the

22 direct observations of an officer.
23

In addition, the Fourth Amendment commands

24 require that a magistrate be neutral and detached and
25 not be a rubber stamp for the police.

So keeping that

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

as the guideline that we're going to use hearsay and not

2 direct observations of the swearing police officer who
3

stands before the magistrate, there must be some

4

guideline or some test to protect the citizens and their

5

Fourth Amendment rights from unreasonable searches and,

6 of course, the police to ferret out crime.

Keeping that as the basis, Your Honor, my

7

8 answer to your guestion is no, this does not establish
9

probable cause because the judge who signed the search

10

warrant had absolutely no way to know whether the letter

11

writer had a grudge, picked up this information in a

12

neighborhood bar, as this Court has said on occasions,

13

gossip in the underworld, that type of conversation.

14

I believe in the Spinelli —

15

QUESTION!

Anytime you're going by hearsay you

16

don't know that the person may not have been motivated

17

by a grudge in this particular instance.
HR. REILLEY:

18
19

is a way to find out if there’s any way to credit that

20 hearsay,
21

Yes, sir, that's true, but there

and this Court has enunciated that; with either

the past track record of reliability or as in Harris, a

22 statement against one's penal interest to add some
23
24
25

reliability to it.
QUESTION;

But that simply rules out the use

of anonymous tips, than.

If you're dealing with a

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

police informer, a knowledgeable police officer can have

2 his affidavit drawn in such a way that to the extent he
3

truthfully can he puts forth the requirements set forth

4

in the cases of this Court.

5

with an anonymous tip, you can't say wall, you really

But when you're dealing

6 ought to have said a little more on this subject.
7

either act on it or you don't.

You

And you're saying, in

8 effect, you can't act on it.
9

MR. REILLEYi

Your Honor, I'm saying that

10

anonymous tips do have a place in criminal law and in

11

crime prevention.

12

not have a case.

13

I certainly do not say that they do

However, I will say that the anonymous tip in

14

this case, even with the corroboration, contrary to my

15

opponent’s view, I do believe that this Court has stated

16

that the corroboration of what an anonymous person says,

17

or what a reliable says, the corroboration itself cannot

18

give the court or the issuing magistrate the ability to

19

find out where he found that information out.

Whether

20 he heard it — corroboration, or even a reliable
21

informant could fabricate out of the whole cloth, as

22 this Court stated.
23

Could lie in detail or lie generally.

So we don't know just by corroboration of

24

facts subsequently -- in fact, if we use the

25

corroboration approach of my opponent, the corroboration

30

QUESTION;

The initial address of the

Yes, but that -- the man had simply

9 overlooked sending his change of address to the motor

11

MR. REILLEY;

12 misunderstood you,

No, I'm sorry, maybe I

Mr. Chief Justice.

The letter

13

writer, the anonymous tipster, did not, in his letter to

14

the Bloomingdale Police Department give an address for

15 the Gates's.

He said -- he gave a location.

16 Greenway in the condominiums in
17

On

Bloomingdale.

The affidavit and the verification of the

18 officer found three separate addresses which are stated
19 in the complaint.

The first one was through the

20 Secretary of State.
21

That's the one I believe Your Honor

is referring to — 209 Darthmouth.

The confidential

22 informant who is referred to who reviewed some financial
23 records — we do not know, of course, what financial
24 records he reviewed,

where he obtained them, whether

25 they were his or someone else's — gave 198 Greenway

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

But yet, when the officer checked with the

2 airlines to determine that Gates was boarding a flight,
3 he got a phone number
4

and the Illinois Bell Telephone

Company gave yet a third address — if you read it

5 carefully,

it's 189 Greenway Drive.
QUESTION;

MR. REILLEY:

Is the

where the specific information comes from to

10 enable the magistrate to, himself as opposed to rubber
11

stamping someone else's opinion -- himself determine

12 from the raw facts if probable cause exists.

QUESTION;

13

Suppose that the letter had said

14 that Mrs. Gates would be wearing a red
15 when she was down in

leather jacket

Florida, and it turned out she was

16 wearing a brown leather

jacket.

Would you say that

17 that's relevant to anything in this scheme?

MR. REILLEY;

18

My answer is this.

That the

19 anonymous letter writer is — the fact that we don't

20 know where that information

came from is the critical

We don't know the basis of the knowledge.

22

If you're going to say the question of a brown

Your Honor, and discuss the — in Draper,
a previously reliable informant giving, let's

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

say, 10 farts, 9 rut of 10 prove true by corroboration,

2 therefore, the syllogism would go to the test, therefore

3 the drugs are present.

However, I believe this Court in

4 Spinelli said that Draper presumed a reliable informant
5 giving that information.
6

Here we have an anonymous person.

We do not

7 know the motive, we don't know who the person is —
8

QUESTION;

What's the motive got to do with it?

9

NR. REILLEY:

I believe in assessing the

10 credibility of the writer and the source of his
11

information.

We don't know if he heard it, if he saw it

12 himself, if he was in the Gates's home or if somebody

13 passed this rumor on three times removed from the author
14 of the letter.

And I believe that's critical because

15 we're talking about going into someone's house with a
16 search warrant to search that person's house.
17

Perhaps in this case it would be fair to say

18 that the police got lucky, and we can't justify what the
19 legality of the search warrant by what it produced.

If

20 nine out of ten times an anonymous letter writer might
21

be speaking out of hearsay, rumor or gossip and the

22 facts would become untrue and they could

search anyone

23 in this courtroom's home and find nothing, I believe
24 this Court would not tolerate a standard based on
25 anonymity as the basis for a search warrant without

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

something more
Again, I don't say that anonymous tipsters do

2
3

not' have a part in criminal law; they certainly do.

4

believe the police, however, are obliged to take the

5

information and do something more with it in order to

I

6 establish criminality.

There is nothing in this search warrant that

7

8 establishes any criminal conduct.
9

Our Supreme Court

viewed it -- the appellate court reviewed it and the

10

trial judge viewed it as corroborating innocent

11

activities, even in view of the letter.
QUESTION;

12

Can you seriously maintain that

13

this was consistent only with innocence, when you have

14

the quick flight to South Florida and the non-stop trip

15

back?

16

HR. REILLEY;

That fact in and of itself, Your

17

Honor, is innocent activity.

18

QUESTION;

Didn't we also have a license plate

19

issued for a different vehicle?

20

HR. REILLEY;

Yes, we did.

1

Gates traveled -- to use the example of perhaps the

2 profile type cases — Hr. Gates traveled to Florida
3 under his own name.
4 profile.

This was not a typical drug courier

If he was going to travel down there to bring

5 $100,000 worth of drugs back, he certainly would think
6 to use a phony name on

an airline ticket.

That he

7 apparently didn’t do because the police officer saw that

8 he used his own name.

His wife registered under her own name in the

9

10 hotel in Florida.
11

That is inconsistent.

I believe, in

answer directly to your question, that the license plate

12 perhaps could be an oversight in terms of -- or perhaps
13 the
14

Secretary of State’s office didn’t get the transfer

in time.

The license plate would be placed on another

15 vehicle if one was sold and one

was purchased, and maybe

16 the computers didn’t catch up to the file.

We can’t

17 assume on that theory that that’s criminal activity.
18

QUESTIONS

Are we to take it from that that if

19 Mrs. Gates had registered as Mrs.
20 his airline ticket

Jones and in getting

he said his name was Anderson, that

then you wouldn't be here?
MR. REILLEYs

I would say if that were true,

23 that could be an element that the court could consider
24 in determining some criminal activity or some means of
25 attempting to hide something.

Nothing that was done

reliable, is it?
MR. REILLEY:

I guess my response. Your Honor,

was to Justice 3'Connor's question about the license

22 plate and regarding whether that fact meant anything.
23

And in response to that I was talking about the fact

24

that his own name was apparently used, since that's what

25

the affidavit seems to indicate.

separately, corroborates any criminality.

The question

that something may or may not be unusual, we don't know

QUESTIONS

Well, that was my assumption, and

you said that that would not be enough in your view.

MR. REILLEY:

11

However, I don't believe that

12

applies to this case.

13

not.

14

this letter were not and did not come close to Draper.

15

There were substantial differences between that letter

16

writer and Draper, in addition, of course, to the fact

17

that Draper was an anonymous informant.

And specifically , the facts that were educed in

But taking Your Honor’s suggestions, I agree

18
19

The theory does but the facts do

with the theory, yes.

The letter does not approach

20 Draper and the detail was not sufficient enough to give
21

some characterization to it as a reliable basis of

22 knowledge.
23

The corroboration, on the other hand, in terms

24

of the veracity prong, was also not sufficient because

25

the corroboration, although innocent detail was

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

corroborated in Draper, was not totally corroborated.

2 There were some errors; there were some things that were
3

not correct.
So if you’re taking -- and I think the Court

4
5

would have to look seriously and closer at an anonymous

6 tip than it would at a confidential police informant.
7

And I think in a case like this, you can use those

8 theories but I think they have to be very carefully
9

analyzed because we're talking about a Fourth Amendment

10

right.

And admittedly, they may apply but not in this

11

fact situation.
QUESTION;

12

Why is an anonymous tip more

13

suspect than that of a police informer who is presumably

14

maybe dependent for his living on what he supplies to

15

the police in the way of information?
KR. REILLEYj

16

I think the answer is this, Your

17

Honor.

That the anonymous tip, we don't know what

18

provokes or suggests him to become anonymous and write

MR. REILLEY:

7

Yes, sir.

Why is that worse than the case of

the police informant who is basically being paid for his

8 information and who presumably has to provide some good
9
10
11

information, may have to provide some bad information,
too?
HR. REILLEY:

Because here we have — with a

12 police informant at least we can, number one, we can
13

establish a real, live human being, a body, who is

14

standing there either before the magistrate or at least

15

with the police officer.

he's involved in criminal conduct of some

sort, but assuming the typical police informant with a

22 track record, despite his conduct in society which we
23

don't condone, the fact is he has given information

24

25

So although there is a standard to look at him

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Therefore, we can't make any judgment about him

supportive for a search warrant.

Why was there a

9

In your case, Your Honor, there would not be a

10 basis of knowledge because the party is speaking in the
11 third person, not reiterating raw data, something he saw
12 or heard or smelled.

And the Court has been consistent

13 in that regard, and we feel that this fact situation
14 cannot be supported and does not support probable cause
15 based upon that analysis.

It simply doesn't state how

16 the person came to his knowledge.

QUESTION!

Let's take it one step beyond now.

18 The police act on this second letter which they think is
19 written by the writer of the first letter, and they

21 Court of Illinois sets aside that conviction on the same
22 ground that you've just advanced.

Certainly, it might arouse some suspicions but

13

the weather was warm up north, also.

I can't say that that fact in and of itself is

What

15 one does that is innocent and what someone else would
16 do,

you can’t -- just because I would do it different

17 than Your Honor might do it or someone else might do it
18 doesn't necessarily make it criminal.

Maybe -- who knows what the reasons for it,

20 but if there were several options available, if there

21 were several choices we can't say well, let's pick the
22 criminal choice because that’s the one we want to pick

that under the analysis this Court has prescribed, which

and the lack of facts in the letter, certainly the

the woman would go to Florida and leave the car and come

back before the husband left, so that the apartment

would not be unattended for a long period of time,

6 indicating probably concern about what was in the

apartment.
But yet, when they verified the facts, that
scenario did not take place.

Instead, she stayed in

10

Florida until he came down there and they did in fact

11

leave the apartment unattended, which would seem to

12

undermine the basis for the suspicion that goods were in

13

the apartment during that interval.

14
15
16

So I would think there would be less basis for
