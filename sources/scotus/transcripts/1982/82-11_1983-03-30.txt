ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. COHEN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. COHEN*

7

8

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court.

9

This is an appeal from the Indiana Court of

10

Appeals.

This case presents the question of whether the

11

Indiana tax sale statutes which were in effect at the

12

time this case arose violate due process in equal

13

protection.

14

of Missions that the Indiana tax sale statutes violate

15

due process because they only provide for constructive

16

notice to a mortgagee of record.

It is the position of the Mennonite Board

The statutes only provided for notice by

17
18

posting at the courthouse and publication in a

19

newspaper.

filed by the Appellee, Richard C. Adams.

21

purchased the property at 1829 Stevens Avenue in Elkhart

22

at a tax sale on August 8,

23

Jean Moore owned the property in fee simple.

24

Mennonite Board of Missions had a mortgage on that

25

property.

This case arose as a quiet title action

1977.

Mr. Adams had

The most significant fact in this case is that

2

the Mennonite 3oard of Missions mortgage was recorded.

3

It was a matter of public record.

4

Elkhart County recorder's office in Volume 388, page 693

of the Elkhart County records.

the Mennonite Board of Missions was thus a matter of

was required to pay the property taxes.

QUESTIONS

11

MR. COHENw

She failed to

Does the record show why?
No, it does not, Justice Blackmun ,

12

as to why she did not pay the taxes.

13

despite not paying the taxes, she was paying that

14

mortgage each month to the Mennonite Board of Missions,

15

which I think is also a very significant point.

16

But she was,

Under Indiana law if the taxes aren’t paid on

17

property for more than 15 months, the county auditor

18

will compile a list of delinquent property tax --

19

properties.

20

notice under Indiana law to the legal title owner.

21

Indiana law does not provide any mailed notice to an

22

owner of the property.

23

And, in this case, they would then send

It is the position of the Mennonite Board of

24

Missions that due process requires, at a minimum, mailed

25

notice to a mortgagee of record.

Had there been notice

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

mailed to the Mennonite Board of Missions, in this case,

2

I submit to this Court that the Mennonite Board of

3

Missions would have paid the taxes.

4

by the fact that soon after they learned that the

5

property had actually been sold for delinquent taxes,

6

they immediately tendered to the trial court the

7

statutory amount due to redeem their property.
QUESTION;

8
9

That's demonstrated

Mr. Cohen, is there any provision

of Indiana law that assures that by inspecting the

10

record of the mortgage, the place at which it has been

11

recorded, whichever, a person would be able to apprise

12

themselves of the present address of the mortgagee as

13

well as the name of the mortgagee?
MR. COHEN;

The mortgage was filed in the

county records in Goshen.

Missions offices have been located in Elkhart County for

19

over 50 years.

Their name and address was on the

QUESTION;

20

The county auditor’s office

You're advocating a principle of

21

request, sending mailed notice to any mortgagee of

22

records,

23

if there might not be situations in which there hasn't

24

been a recorded mortgage -- where the present address of

25

the mortgagee was not available from the recording data.

I take it.

Now what I'm trying to find out is

1

HR. COHEN;

Justice Rehnquist, if the mortgage

2

was not recorded, I do not believe that the county

3

auditor would be forced to search titles and give notice

4

to anybody.

5

couldn't have sent notice.

If the mortgage wasn’t recorded, they

QUESTION.-

No, but —

7

QUESTION;

The question —

8

QUESTION;

What if the mortgage had been

9

10

recorded, but the mortgage either didn’t show the
mortgagee’s address or the mortgagee had moved.

11

MR. COHEN;

That is a question that is not

12

applicable to this case, but that would be something

13

that would be a fact question that would possibly

14

relieve the county auditor from sending notice -- actual

15

notice.

16

recorded in your given hypothetical, then it would be

17

incumbent upon the county auditor to send notice to the

18

last known address.

But I do believe that if the mortgage was

19

In this case —

20

QUESTION;

Would he be entitled to treat the

21

mortgage — the address shown on the mortgage as the

22

last known address even if it turned out, in fact, to be

23

the third last known address?

24

MR. COHEN:

25

Yes, I believe he would unless the

county auditor knew that the mortgagor -- or rather the

6

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

mortgagee had actually moved.

2

shown that the county auditor knew that the mortgagee's

3

address had changed and the county auditor knew that, I

4

think it would be incumbent upon the county auditor to

5

send notice under those circumstances.

6
7

QUESTION;

Does the record show the contents

of the notice that was published in this case?

8
9

If the facts could be

MR. COHEN;
O'Connor.

No, it does not, Justice

But we are not questioning the form of

10

published notice given in this case itself.

11

saying, however, that published —

12

QUESTION;

We're

What is in -- what is contained in

13

that published form of notice?

14

MR. COHEN;

Under Indiana law, the statutes

15

provide that the name of the owner of the property will

16

be listed, an address, if possible, but it does not

17

require a specific street address.

18

should be in the notice, and that's —

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. COHEN;

The legal title

And the mortgagee's name or not?
There is no present -- there is no

21

requirement under the Indiana law in effect at the time

22

this case arose to send mailed notice at all to a

23

mortgagee.

24
25

That is -QUESTION;

Yes, but I'm just asking about the

published notice, what it contained.

HR. COHEN:

Okay.

2

of the legal title owner.

3

of the mortgagee.

4

It would contain the name
It would not .contain the name

In this particular case, the published records

5

of Elkhart County demonstrate that although the county

6

auditor sent notice to Moore, she never picked up the

7

certified mailing, that the property was then sold to

8

Adams, but significantly, Moore continued to pay the

9

property — to pay the money due and owing under the

10

mortgage to the Mennonite Board of Missions.

11

Indiana law provides for a two-year period of

12

time to redeem the property following the sale at -- by

13

a county official.

14

giving notice to the legal title owner prior to the

15

expiration of the redemption period.

16

absolutely no provision in Indiana law at the time this

17

case arose to notify a mortgagee of record that the

18

redemption period is about to expire.

19

The Indiana statutes provide for

But there was

Under Indiana law, once the redemption period

20

expires the tax deed purchaser, in this case Adams,

21

obtains a fee simple absolute, free and clear of any

22

prior lien or encumbrance.

23

In this case we submit to this Court that the

24

fact that the notice was only constructive and, by

25

posting and publication initially to the Mennonite Board

1

of Missions/ in conjunction with the fact that there was

2

absolutely no notice given at all to the Mennonite Board

3

of Missions prior to the expiration of the redemption

4

period, results in the Mennonite Board of Missions

5

having their prior reported mortgage taken from them by

6

state action with inadequate notice and without any

7

compensation at all.

8
9

QUESTIONi

Just a question of proceedure.

You

stated the title in fee simple blossomed in the

10

purchaser at the tax sale after the expiration period,

11

Does he nevertheless have to go into court on a quiet

12

title action?

13

MR. COHENi

He does, Justice Blackmun.

But

14

the statute provides that if notice were given to the

15

legal title owner an d that is then prima facie ev idence

16

QUESTION:

What does an ordinary bank mortagee

do in Indiana?

7

MR. COHEN*

Well, Justice Blackmun, I'm not

8

really sure what an ordinary bank would do in Indiana.

9

I'm sure that many banks would vary their type of

10

arrangements of looking after their particular loan.

However, the Mennonite Board of Missions is not a

However -QUESTION:

Part of the response to Justice

21

Blackmun*s question, indeed, that in many cases banks

22

and insurance companies that have numerous mortgages

23

that they are holding arrange -- make arrangements to

24

see that all of the legal publications are sent to them

25

and checked by someone.

That's inherent in the notice

1

by publication system, is it not?

2

MR. COHEN;

I think notice by posting and

3

publication to a bank or to the Mennonite Board of

4

Missions, each, under Indiana law would be

5

unconstitutional.

This Court —

6

7

MR. COHEN;

Not if the bank actually saw the

notice, Your Honor, no.

QUESTION;

11

Well, this is not inherence, and

12

part of the system of lending on secured loans with

13

mortgages or trusts, that there’s an obligation on the

14

part of the holder of the mortgage to keep in touch with

15

the situation.
MR. COHEN;

1

bank or an insurance company to keep a close check on

2

possible foreclosures or additional liens against their

3

security, but they do it as a matter of prudence.

4

MR. COHEN:

They have, perhaps, the resources

5

and the sophistication to do that, but the Mennonite

6

Board of Missions as a charitable organization was not

7

accustomed to doing something like that nor did the law

8

require that they do that.

9

submit, Mr. Chief Justice, that the law required them to

10

They did everything, I

do under the circumstances.

11

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Cohen, was your client’s

12

interest in the property totally destroyed by the fact

13

of the tax sale purchase alone, or is — to follow up on

14

Justice Blackman’s question, was there yet to be another

15

proceeding whereby the tax sale purchaser confirmed his

16

title?

17

MR. COHEN*

His -- our interest was finally

18

adjudicated in the quiet title action itself but the

19

adjudication was a foregone conclusion, is what I meant

20

to say to Mr. Justice Blackmun.

21

law, once the tax deed purchaser obtained his tax deed

22

from the county auditor after the expiration of the

23

redemption period, under Indiana law he had the property

24

free and clear.

25

QUESTION:

That is, under Indiana

So, it isn't simply a question of

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

having to pay a penalty plus the amount the tax sale

2

purchaser paid by the time your client had notice?

3

MR. COHEN:

That's correct.

By the time our

4

client obtained actual notice of the tax sale itself it

5

— the redemption period expired and they were never

6

given an opportunity.

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. COHEN;

9

10

How long was the redemption period?
The redemption perioi is two years

when the property is purchased by a private individual
as in this case.

11

QUESTION;

You mean, that for two years this

12

property had been sold for taxes and your client had a

13

mortgage on it, but had no knowledge of the fact that it

14

had been sold for taxes?

15

MR. COHEN;

That's correct. Justice

16

Rehnguist.

17

continued to pay them each month on the mortgage.

There was no attack on that property, so to

QUESTION;

The only situation that

I think most mortgagees in the

agreement between the mortgagor and the mortgagee have

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

an agreement whereby the mortgagor has to pay taxes, and

2

the mortgagee has some overseeing by virtue of an escrow

3

fund, doesn’t it?

4

MR. COHEN*

As far as what type of

5

sophisticated mortgage transaction there may be in the

6

case you mentioned as far as escrowing the money, that

7

is not what happened in this case.

11

The Mennonites are

Well do you think that’s really the

12

basis for a constitutional argument?

13

trusted someone to do it and, therefore, you're not

14

bound by any constructive service or third party notice

15

statutes at all?
MR. COHEN:

16

To say that you

Under the facts of this case I do

17

believe that’s correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because I

18

think the focus of this Court really should be on what

19

the state did, or really what the state failed to do.

20

That is, the state failed to send adequate notice in

21

this case.

22

QUESTION:

May I ask -- there was no notice

23

before either the tax sale or the expiration of the

24

redemption period.

25

adequate if either one of those was given?

In your view would notice be

MR. COHEN:

Had there been mailed notice to

the Mennonite Board of Missions, yes.

3

case was pending -- as it worked its way up the

4

appellate level in the State of Indiana, the Indiana

5

legislature actually amended the tax sale statutes, and

6

they now provide for the very type of notice that we are

7

requesting here.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. COHEN:

In fact, as this

Was that because of this litigation?
I submit that that's in all

10

likelihood true. Justice Elackmun.

11

legislative recognition by the Indiana legislature that

12

the system.that was in effect was simply

13

unconstitutional, that it was not difficult or

14

burdensome for a county auditor to look at the public

records and send notice.

How prevalent are the statutes

requiring notice to mortgagees?
MR. COHEN:

Are you talking about nationwide,

Justice White?

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. COHEN:

Yes.
There is a Yale Law Review article

22

cited in the brief and it is a 1975 article.

In that

23

brief it talks about 21 states that only provide for

24

notice by posting and publication, and I might add the

25

author urges those legislatures to amend those statutes.

But I think -----

Mr. Cohen, I suppose it's totally

irrevelant, but was Mrs. Moore a member of the church?
MR. COHEN:

No, she was not a member of the

21

Mennonite Church, and this was an arms-length

22

transaction between the parties.

23

of the Mennonite Board of Missions nor was she the

24

caretaker for the Mennonite Board of Missions in this

25

particular case.

She was not the agent

It was an arms-length transaction and,

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

in this case, there is inadequate notice to the

2

Mennonite Board of Missions.

3

QUESTION*

As Mrs. —

In this recording of the mortgage

4

deed, is an address given for the Mennonite Board of

5

Missions to which notice could be sent?
MR. COHEN;

6

Okay.

In the mortgage that was

Missions.

well-known.

22

about finding the Mennonite Board of Missions?

23
24
25

MR. COHEN;

I'm not sure I quite understand

your question.
QUESTION;

How could you find out if you

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

that much interested in it to make such a call, but a

9

great many might not be.

MR. COHEN;

But, confining ourselves to the

11

specific facts of this case, this Court has said that

12

adequate notice under due process is notice reasonably

13

calculated to inform interested persons of a pending

14

action to provide them an opportunity to appear and

15

assert their rights.

16

In this particular case, under the Indiana

17

statute in effect at the time this case arose, notice by

18

posting and publication is simply inadquate, that it

19

would be a very relative, easy matter for the Elkhart

20

County auditor to have sent notice by mail.

21

has set forth the balancing test of what should be

22

looked at as far as what due process is accorded in a

23

given situation.

this Court, this case falls squarely within Mullane,

9

that this case cannot really be distinguished from

10

Mullane.

And on that basis, I submit that this Court

11

would have to reverse the Indiana Court of Appeals.
And this case, I submit, Mr. Chief Justice,

12

13

also falls squarely within the case decided by this

Court, the City — Walker versus City of Hutchinson

case.

established in Mullane.

This Court recently, just last term, in Green

The Green v. Lindsey case involved the

I submit to this Court that posting on the

property or an intrusion on the property by the state is

17

far more likely or reasonably calculated to inform a

21

Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court.
I believe the beginning point is to determine

whether or not this is a property right.

And we concede

24

that the Mennonite Board of Missions' interest in this

25

real estate is a "property right."

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 626-9300

1

But I think the first place to begin is that

2

the Court should understand and determine under Indiana

3

law that a mortgagee is not an owner of any property.

4

The Furnish case which is a case in Indiana where the

5

supreme court reiterated the decision that it made in

6

Mennonite Board versus Adams, I quote,"that a mortgagee

7

is not an owner as well established by Indiana law, and

8

further, a mortgagee has not title to the land

9

mortgaged."

Now that is mentioned because, in a due

10

process question as such as is before the Court, Court

11

— case law indicates that there is a balancing test.

18

I can find, that has answered the question as to whether

a mortgagee requires notice by mail in the 50

jurisdictions, excluding Puerto Rico and others.

equitable owner.

3

QUESTION;

I'm going to assume that Indiana

has a lien law comparable to all other states so that a

mechanic or a laborer who performs some services or

6

furnishes materials could file a lien on the property.

Now that's certainly a property

right, isn* t it?

MR . MILLER ;

But is it essentially an Indiana

12

law the same as the mortgage lienor's -- mortgagees lien

rights?

14

MR. MILLER;

Each has a lien.

Now, in some

15

states, it may be that an interest in a mortgage is an

16

equitable interest in the real estate.

17

to know that in Indiana it is not.

18

I want the Court

The second question, and I think my opponent

19

didn't make it clear -- my research indicates that this

20

Court has never determined that notice by publication is

21

not constitutionally sufficient for an owner of real

22

estate sold at a tax sale or a tax deed.

23

There are extremely good reasons as to why

24

notice by publication is or would be sufficient.

There

25

is only one state, and that is Arizona, that I can find

money and as professional money lenders, prudence

That statute is used in my research in some of the —

some of the other states.

6

I've never had the opportunity to use it.

The Appellant in this case has indicated in

7

his brief and, again in that same footnote, that the law

8

of the State of Indiana is that a deed and mortgage is

9

taken to the auditor.

10

The law in the State in Indiana is, is that a

11

deed, before it be recorded, is taken to the auditor and

12

placed on there are the words to be entered for

13

taxation, or words to that effect.

14

down who owns the property and their address and — so

15

that the county knows, that are going to be taxed.

16

The auditor writes

As to mortgages, the statute says and only

17

says, that before the auditor makes that endorsement on

18

the deed, he may require a tax identification number,

19

and I emphasize may, on other instruments including

20

mortgages that divest a person of a mortgage.

21

sounds a little complicated, but Indiana has a law that

There is no requirement to take the mortgage

the mortgagee, informed them that the property had been

sold for delinquent taxes.

5

investigating what happened as far as why the taxes

payment had not gone onto a computer list and had it

gone onto the computer list, it would have never made

So the mailing of notice would actually assist

the state in notifying mortgagees who are likely to pay
