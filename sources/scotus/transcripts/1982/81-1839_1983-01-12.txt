CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

3

may proceed when you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE C. BROWN, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

5

MR. BROWN:

6

7

Mr. Chief Justice and Justices of

this Honorable Court:
The Appellant before you is Minneapolis Star

8
9

Hr. Brown, I think you

and Tribune Company, locally known in Minnesota as Star

10

and Tribune.

It is the largest circulation daily

11

newspaper in the State of Minnesota.
This appeal presents two levels of issues

12

13

which are essentially press clause First Amendment

14

issues.

15

State of Minnesota may tax publishers of Minnesota

16

newspapers by imposing a tax on their consumption of

17

paper and ink, or whether such a form of tax is

18

prohibited by the press clause of the First Amendment in

19

this Court's 1936 decision in the Grosjean case.

20

The first issue, as we view it, is whether the

Our view of that basic issue is that it is

21

extremely narrow, it is essentially a revisiting of this

22

Court's decision in Grosjean, and that the tax we

23

challenge in terms of constitutional magnitude is

24

factually indistinguishable from the stamp taxes in

25

England and the colonies of Massachusetts and New York

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

imposed during the 1700s.
The second issue that vie present assumes that

2

3

we have lost on the first issue.

4

such a use tax on paper and ink may constitutionally be

5

imposed on the business of publishing newspapers, then

6

is it still constitutional when the state of Minnesota,

7

by enacting an annual $100,000 exemption which has the

8

effect of imposing the tax only on approximately a dozen

9

or so of Minnesota’s large circulation daily newspapers

The second issue is if

10

and also has the effect of removing from the burden of

11

the tax approximately 370 to 380 of Minnesota’s other

12

newspapers who simply do not consume on an annual basis

13

$100,000 worth of paper and ink?
The background of the tax may be summarized

14
15

briefly.

16

a sales and use tax program.

17

exemption, the use tax here at issue was, for the first

18

time, visited upon all Minnesota newspapers.

19

1971 until January 1 of 1974, all newspapers in

20

Minnesota who consumed paper and ink, and by definition

21

since paper and ink are the only two physical components

22

of a newspaper, they all did, they were all, therefore,

23

subjected to the tax at issue.

24
25

In 1967, Minnesota for the first time adopted

On January 1,

In 1971, through an

And from

1974, by virtue of the annual

$100,000 exemption and thereafter, during the timeframe

1

that is at issue here, January 1,

2

1975, which is the refund period for which this action

3

was commenced in the Hennepin County District Court in

4

Minneapolis, Minnesota, the only papers in Minnesota who

5

paid the tax were the large circulation dailies.

6

the Minneapolis Star and Tribune —
QUESTION;

7

1974 through May of

And

Mr. Brown, when you say the large

8

circulation dailies, how many of those did that cover

9

within the state?
MB. BROWN;

10

Your Honor, according to the

11

records submitted in support of Star Tribune's summary

12

judgment motion, I think there were approximately 29 and

13

27.

14

I may be off a little bit in the numbers.
QUESTION;

What was the approximate

15

circulation of the newspaper with the least circulation

16

which nonetheless was subject to the tax?

17

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

I think the Brainard

18

Dispatch, Your Honor, is the one which in 1974 was not

19

subject to the tax and in 1975 was, and it was at about

20

14 to 15 thousand a year.

21

backwards, but that's about the cutoff.

22

Now, I may have those years

The procedural background in this case was

23

that the action for the refund of approximately $875,000

24

of use taxes paid,

25

are dealing here with a 17-month timeframe which is the

was commenced in August of 1975.

We

5

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

defined period for which we sued to obtain a refund.
We proceeded to move the trial court for

2
3

summary judgment, and in support of our motion we

4

submitted a fact record consisting of affidavit

5

testimony.

6

an affidavit from Mr. Shaw who ran the Minnesota

7

Newspaper Publishers Association which sets forth the

8

statistical basis identifying Minnesota legal newspapers

9

and the relative circulations of those newspapers who do

There was also, as one of our fact showings,

10

pay the tax, and the Minnesota Supreme Court has set

11

forth in its formal opinion in this case the statistical

12

data defining who was publishing newspapers and who was

13

subjected to the tax.

14

The trial court granted summary judgment for

15

Star Tribune on all constitutional issues presented.

16

the oral argument before the trial court, the state

17

orally moved for summary judgment on the basis of the

18

fact records submitted by Star and Tribune.

19

to note that point, because we are here before this

20

Court challenging the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme

21

Court which reversed the trial court, with the same

22

identical fact record that we had at the trial court.

23

And that was a fact record which the state adopted as

24

its own in support of its motion for summary judgment.

25

At

And I pause

The state has never submitted any factual

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

showing that would in any way indicate that the factual

2

record submitted by Star Tribune was not a thorough and

3

accurate record on which this case may be adjudicated.

4

QUESTION;

What's the law —

5

QUESTION;

-- tax that applied to all

6

consumers, all the newspapers in the state, no exemption

7

on the 100,000.
MR. BROWN;

8
9

And the point being taxed, Mr.

Chief Justice, is the use or consumption of paper and

10

ink.

We challenged the constitutionality of that under

11

the First Amendment and under a combined First Amendment

12

equal protection strict scrutiny standard of review.
QUESTION;

13

Could I change that a little bit?

14

Suppose you had a general sales tax to which newspapers

15

were subject?

16

that tax?

17
18

Would you be here or would you challenge

MR. BROWN;

We would, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

but let me say that we would —

19

QUESTION;

You would or would not?

20

MR. BROWN;

We would, sir, but we would do so

21

first, with the acknowledgement that in no way does Star

22

and Tribune challenge the power of the state of

23

Minnesota or any other state in the exercise of its

24

broad general revenue-raising t ax powers, to impose

25

broad forms of taxation equally and non-discriminatorily

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

on all businesses which are fairly classified together

2

with one caveat, and that is that if there is anything

3

left of Murdock, and Follett, we believe that broad form,

4

non-discriminatory taxes as applied in certain First

5

Amendment activity may be unconstitutional because as

6

applied, they improperly burden the exercise of First

7

Amendment activity.

8

QUESTION 4

9
10
11

Could that be rephrased to say the

Star Tribune has no objection to the state of Minnesota
taxing any business except the newspaper business?
MR. BROWN;

I don't think so. Your Honor.

I

12

think that's over-statement because the record that we

13

submitted to the trial court and that's before this

14

Court affirmatively establishes that Star Tribune pays

15

income taxes, real property taxes, payroll taxes, all

16

business taxes of broad form.

17

QUESTION:

18
19

I imagine 3M does the same.

3M, if

it sells at retail probably has to pay a sales tax.
MR. BROWN:

That's correct. Your Honor.

The

20

distinction is that Star Tribune has First Amendment

21

rights under the Press Clause, but 3M does not.

22

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Brown, back in the days of the

liner type, could Minnesota tax all users of lead?

24

MR. BROWN;

25

QUESTION:

Of lead.

Your Honor, —

This is back when you had liner

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

type.

Ancient history.
MR. BROWN:

Well, not all that ancient.

Your

3

Honor, I think, that that type of tax generally

4

applicable to the consumption of lead as it applies to

5

the newspaper business probably would have been

6

constitutional because I can find nowhere in the stamp

7

tax cases in the 1700s in England or in this country,

8

direct historical reference points for taxes on

9

knowledge which were imposed on the consumption of lead.

10

QUESTION:

It would be like a payroll tax.

11

MR. BROWN:

I don't think it would be like a

12

payroll tax as applied to the business of publishing a

13

newspaper. Your Honor.

14
15

QUESTION:

Did I understand your response to

mean that only newspapers have First Amendment rights?

16

MR. BROWN:

17

suggest that at all.

18
19

20

No, Your Honor, I don't mean to

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Well, you suggested

that 3M didn't have any First Amendment rights.
MR. BROWN:

3M does have First Amendment

21

rights when it exercises speech, but 3M's products — I

22

thought Mr. Justice Rehnquist was saying if they were

23

taxed, wouldn't they be identical to the tax on paper

24

and ink here at issue.

25

paper and ink here at issue is a tax imposed on the

And my point is that the tax on

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

consumption of those two commodities by newspapers.

2

in that context, I don't think 3M has a Press Clause

3

First Amendment right.

4

does .

5

QUESTION;

And

I think Star Tribune clearly

Now, would you apply that to

6

Minnesota Mining's advertising?

7

know they have a tremendous volume of paper going out --

8

paper with ink used to print the message.

9

Amendment protection?

10

MR. BROWN;

I suspect — in fact I

Is that First

Your Honor, dealing with the tax

11

here at issue, the statutory phrase that is pivotal is

12

the phrase "publications.”

13

legislature chose to classify it.

14

endeavored to demonstrate that that tax is only paid by

15

Minnesota newspapers, and by virtue of the $100,000

16

annual exemption, only large circulation Minnesota

17

18

That’s the way the Minnesota
Our proof here

In the case of 3M, I've got to believe, Mr.

19

Chief Justice, that if 3M had ever been subjected to

20

Minnesota's use tax on paper and ink, that fact would

21

appear here in this record because it was in the

22

self-interest of the state in meeting our arguments to

23

prove that kind of fact.

24

this record.

25

There are no such facts in

The only facts in this record are that the tax

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which the legislature imposed on publications is, in

2

fact, only* during the period of time at issue, a

3

newspaper tax.
QUESTIONS

4
5

This tax would apply to a textbook

manufacturer, too, would it not?

6

MR. BROWNs

7

QUESTION;

8

9

No.

Textbook —

How about the West Publishing

Company?
MR. BROWN;

I think their products. Your

10

Honor, wind up being taxed on tKe sales at retail.

11

see, you have exempt publications under the dichotomy of

12

the sales and the use tax scheme that Minnesota has

13

established.

14

QUESTION;

Well, West Publishing Company must

15

use almost as much ink and pulp as most of the

16

newspapers, don’t they?

17

MR. BROWN;

Substantial, Your Honor.

Clearly,

18

they do and yet, they do not -- they are not, by

19

statute, subjected to the use tax because they don't

20

meet the statutory definition of "publication."

21

You

QUESTION;

Well, the case was judged in the

22

Minnesota Supreme Court on the basis — was upheld on

23

the basis that it just applied to newspapers.

24

MR. BROWN;

25

QUESTION;

The Minnesota Supreme Court -And only certain newspapers.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. BROWN;

1

That's what they lid, Judge.

And

2

they accepted — the Minnesota Supreme Court accepted

3

our proof that this is a newspaper tax —

4
5

QUESTION;

Well, that's the construction given

of this statute by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
MR. BROWN;

6

That seems to be what they tell

7

us.

And they tell us, nonetheless, it does not violate

8

the constitutional protections of the First Amendment

9

under the Press Clause.

10

They also tell us that because -- and this is

11

a very telling point to at least me — they say because

12

one of the purposes of the statute is to raise revenue,

13

that in itself insulates It from the constitutional

14

challenge that we present.
Well, all the stamp taxes in England were

15
16

enacted to raise revenues.

The stamp tax of 1712 was

17

imposed on various articles of commerce including the

18

paper that printers had to buy to lawfully communicate

19

with their readers.

20

QUESTION;

Mr. Brown, would you hazard a guess

21

as to why the Minnesota legislature imposed the $100,000

22

exemption?

23

MR. BROWN;

Your Honor, any guess I would

24

hazard would go beyond the record of this case.

25

we point out in our brief,

For as

there is no legislative

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) S54-2345

1

history that the Minnesota legislature sought to create

2

to explain why it did what it did when it did it.

3

In terms of my speculation, I would only

4

invite the Court to look to the effect of the tax.

5

have established, we believe, that the effect of the tax

6

is to tax only newspapers, and the effect of the

7

$100,000 exemption is to limit the impact of the tax on

8

only a dozen or so of Minnesota’s largest circulation

9

newspapers.

10

QUESTION*

11

MR. BROWN:

12
13

We

And 95 percent of it on two.
That's correct, Your Honor, the

Minneapolis and St. Paul newspapers.
QUESTION:

With respect to the Brainard and

14

the Austin and the Mankato papers that apparently are

15

also subject to the tax, would you say that they are a

16

homogeneous class, if one can speak in those terms, with

17

the Minneapolis and St. Paul dailies?

18

MR. BROWN*

I wouldn't call them homogeneous;

19

I would call them competitors, because the circulation

20

of the Twin Cities newspapers of Minneapolis and St.

21

Paul extends throughout the state of Minnesota and into

22

adjoining states.

23

that they are all newspapers.

24

that they are all in the business of publishing

25

newspapers, and to the extent their circulation levels

They are homogeneous, Your Honor, in
They are homogenous in

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ara sufficient to consume enough paper and ink to exceed

2

the annual exemption, they are homogenous in that they

3

all have to pay some amount of tax.
QUESTION*

4

But then I take it that you’re not

5

suggesting that there was anything other than an

6

economic or tax-oriented, tax policy-oriented reason for

7

the ^100,000 cutoff.

8

that wouldn't pay under the $100,000 cutoff also are

9

published dailies, they consume newsprint and that sort

10

Because a lot of other newspapers

of thing.
MR. BROWN:

11

I’m afraid I can’t go that far.

12

Perhaps my experience in 20 plus years of practicing in

13

Minnesota, watching the Minnesota political scene and

14

appearing before my home court states courts has tended

15

to make me a little more suspicious than that. Tour

16

Honor.

17

this case, is confirmed.

18

And my suspicion, it would seem on the record of

Most of us in common daily life are judged by

19

the consequences of the acts that we perform, and that's

20

really the standard that we’d seek to have this court

21

apply to the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court

22

that this is a constitutional tax.

23

QUESTION:

It isn't.

Is it a realistic proposition that

24

a substantial majority of the Minnesota legislature have

25

of the local newspapers that are not subject to this tax?

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. EROWN;

1

That’s clearly the case with the

2

makeup of the Minnesota legislative bodies, the Senate

3

and the House, Your Honor.

4

comments to the questions that have been put to me to be

5

interpreted that I think, or that Star Tribune thinks,

6

that legislative motive or intent is critical to a First

7

Amendment analysis of the tax here at issue.
We have taken the position in our brief, and

8

9
10

However, I don’t want my

we stand by it, that the illicit or bad legislative
intent is not the basis for the holding in Grosjean.
QUESTION;

11

Well, of course, there are

12

decisions that have so interpreted Grosjean, are there

13

not ?

14

MR. BROWN;

You’re absolutely correct, Justice

15

O’Connor, and to that extent I believe those lower court

16

decisions have misinterpreted Grosjean.

17

If I may give you two reference points from

18

the transcript in Grosjean, and I think we only need

19

two, there is no doubt that the parties in Grosjean knew

20

what they were fighting about.

21

At page 45 of Louisiana’s brief after

22

discussing at some length various forms of taxes of

23

general application which in the brief they say, we

24

could have enacted those kinds of statutes and had a

25

lawful test.

They said, the tax levied by the Louisiana

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

legislature is not such a tax; the legislature could

2

have levied such a tax but it did not do so.

3

it imposed the tax on the business of selling or making

4

any charge for advertising or for advertisements.

5

Instead,

So the position of Louisiana was we have the

6

power to impose that form of tax on the business of

7

publishing a newspaper.

8

brief in that case, the counter-point is presented.

9

These appellees are not discussing the burden of the

At page 30 of the appellee’s

10

particular tax; rather, they assert that the legislature

11

does not have the power to levy a tax on their business

12

such as it has levied.

13

I believe that the holding in the Grosjean

14

case is simply and narrowly that there are certain forms

15

of taxes which legislatures of the various states are

16

prohibited from enacting.

17

taxes on knowledge which seek to impose direct taxes on

18

circulation revenues, on advertising revenues or on the

19

consumption of paper.

20

QUESTION;

Very narrow forms such as the

Mr. Brown, I take it, then, that

21

you adhere to what I think is your position that if the

22

Minnesota legislature sits down and says 50 percent of

23

our gross revenues are raised by sales/use tax

24

combinations on people in business to make money, and

25

we're looking at the present structure and we see

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

there’s a sales tax on almost every business entity in

2

the state.

3

sales tax we hit with a use tax.

4

been very tough to collect a sales tax on newspapers

5

because so many of them are sold from boxes or by

6

carrier boys, and we think newspapers should furnish

7

their fair share of sales tax revenue to the state, so

8

we're going to tax them with a use tax on ink and paper,

9

which is going to turn out to be less payment by them

10

13

Traditionally, it's

than if we tried to tax their retail sales of newspapers.
You say that’s prohibited by the First

11
12

Host of the ones that we can’t hit with a

Amendment?
MR. BROWNs

We do. Your Honor.

But we say so

14

in perhaps a better context than I think was your

15

question, because the way you phrased your question it

16

left me with the impression that you feel that if the

17

state of Minnesota lacks the power to impose this form

18

of tax, somehow the large papers in Minnesota are going

19

to get away with something.

20

And if that is Your Honor’s impression, I

21

would urge you to go back over the historical references

22

that we have cited, because taxes on paper, Mr. Justice

23

Rehnquist, were one of the three pressure points by

24

which the newspapers in England were regulated through

25

QUESTION;

Well, true.

Sales and use taxes

But I think, one could

11

read the First Amendment to feel that if you simply

12

singled out newspapers and taxed them and didn't tax 3M

for its sales, or any other Minnesota commercial entity

14

for its sales, you would have a real First Amendment

problem.

But if the newspaper as a commercial entity is

simply being made to pay a fair share of the use tax

those are two different cases.

MR. BROWN;

6

Well, we do argue that. Your

The only reason we ever got into the sales tax

justify the constitutionality of the tax at issue with

If you assume, contrary to your position, that a sales

tax on newspapers would be permissible, -- uniform as to

20

all comparable businesses — why then is a use tax,

MR. EROWN;

All right.

Our position is that

2

certain forms of taxes historically have been proven to

3

be the vehicle by which legislatures attempt to exercise

4

control or restraint over the press.

5

all the stamp taxes that were imposed on paper.

6

legislators of the 1700s were less inhibited in stating

7

their true reasons why they imposed taxes, and the

8

historical references make clear that the stamp taxes

9

were imposed to restrain and control the press.

10

That is true of
The

It is because, Your Honor, the form of the tax

11

being placed on the only two physical components of the

12

newspaper that creates the danger that if the power to

13

impose such taxes is recognized, then the regulation

14

thereafter is gone.

15

Whereas, when you're dealing with a general

16

sales tax there is at least the comfort that the

17

newspapers in Minnesota find themselves in bed with all

18

of the other taxpayers with a common view that no one

likes to pay taxes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. KEMPAINEN, Esq.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

I don’t mean

MR. KEMPAINEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1971, the state of Minnesota was engaged in

16

fashioning one of its most important social and

17

political programs in its history.

18

comprehensive tax and financial reform act which took up

19

over 116 pages.

The result was a

Over half of this volume of the

Enacted as part and parcel of this law and yet

22

taking up only one-half of a page in it, was the basic

23

use tax on paper and ink that we have here.

24

one has to do is to read this large tax reform measure

25

in order to understand that its basic purpose was

Now, all

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

revenue raising, its basic purpose was a social program

2

of creating more equal educational opportunities for

3

Minnesotans.

4

The basic thrust of the 1971 law, of which the

5

basic use tax here was a part, was to lower the overall

6

property tax burdens in Minnesota which were very high

7

at the time, and to make up for the subsequent loss in

8

revenue through increasing the statewide income tax and

9

the statewide sales and use tax, and then to

10

redistribute that revenue back 'to the local governments

11

and particularly, back to local school districts for the

12

purpose, the avowed purpose, of equalizing educational

13

opportunity throughout Minnesota at that time.

14

It was an important social experiment in

15

Minnesota and it happened to be a successful one, at

16

least in the early 1970s when it became popularly known

17

as the Minnesota Miracle.

18

This legislative background, which we feel the

19

appellant has given inadequate treatment to, as well as

20

the statutory language of this tax on its face shows

21

that Minnesota’s use tax on paper and ink, the basic use

22

tax, is purely and simply a revenue-raising measure.

23

other purpose either has been or can be ascribed to it

24

under this record.

25

No

This history as well as the statutory language

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

also shows that Minnesota’s use tax on paper and ink is

2

an integral part of a general system of taxation, and

3

that it is tied to the general sales and use tax rate.

4

In 1971 it was imposed at the same sales and use tax

5

rate, 4 percent, as all other sales and use taxes in

6

Minnesota.

7

general rate.
Therefore, the rate of tax upon paper and ink

9

And today it is still tied to that same

cannot be increased without also raising the rate upon

10

all other businesses subject to the sales and use tax in

11

the state.

12

I think it's also important to point out that

13

this legislative history and the statutory language on

14

its face shows that this tax was imposed at the lesser

15

wholesale value of the paper and ink and not at its

16

retail value when it's finally incorporated into the

17

final product.

18

general sales tax had been imposed upon all newspapers.

19

Which would have been the case if a

tailored its statute so as to achieve that

2

purpose.

3

purpose, and that purpose was to establish this taxing

4

scheme as being more equitable, taking into account the

5

special problems dealt with by small publishers through

6

a device, I would point, which is an exclusion that

7

applies equally and with the same benefit to even the

8

large publishers across the board.

Instead, we contend it was for another

This history, as well as the statutory

10

language, also points out -- and especially the

11

statutory language, in response to Justice White’s

12

question of the appellant -- is that this does apply to

13

all publications across the board — publications as

14

they are defined in the Minnesota statutes.

15

When Minnesota first enacted its sales and use

16

tax in 1967, it did not exempt all printed matter per

17

se, even though all printed matter, obviously, is

18

subject to First Amendment protections.

19

20

deemed to be publications, and that definition of what

And I was getting to

In the very beginning of the Supreme Court's

opinion on the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement,

We did not feel it

was necessary since it was on the face of the statute

itself that this applied to all publications and not

When Justice White asks you about

interpret that to mean evidence from the receipts

department of the Taxation Division to the effect that

they had receipts from such-and-such a taxpayer, or

10
11

whether the tax is intended to cover other publications?
MR. KEMPAINEN:

I take it that Justice White’s

12

question — and correct me if I’m wrong, Justice White,

13

— is that the evidence is that particular taxpayers

14

other than newspapers did pay this tax.

And

21

you say that this is a tax that on the face of it, —

22

and we must assume it’s true because the Supreme Court

of Minnesota recited it -- is a tax on all publications,

MR. KEMPAINEN;

10

West Publishing Company, Your

11

Honor, does not — their end product, their books that

12

the West Publishing Company prints, their end product is

13

subject to sales tax at the retail level and, therefore,

14

is not considered a publication.

16

ink as a newspaper does.

MR. KEMPAINEN;

Oh, it certainly does, Your

Probably more so.

QUESTION;

I should think so.

20

MR. KEMPAINEN;

And the paper and ink that is

21

used by West Publishing is already being subjected —

22

2

And getting back to a point that I just made,

3

what the legislature did here, instead of imposing this

4

tax at the point of the retail sale which might be

5

considered too close to actual communicative acts, the

6

communicative act of printing and disseminating a

7

newspaper, instead it went back a step and it tried to

8

get away from — as far away from the communicative act

9

as possible by instead taxing the wholesale purchase of

10

paper and ink by a commercial publication.

11

Under Minnesota law, do you agree

that the sales tax where it's imposed is passed on to

QUESTION:

1

May I ask a question -- I may not

2

have followed — on what a publication is within the

3

meaning of the statute.

4

the term "publication” is defined just to include

5

newspapers.

As I understood the statute,

Is that right?

SB. KEMPAINEN:

6

No, that's not correct. Your

7

Honor.

The term "publication" is any printed matter

8

which is sent out at regular intervals of three months

9

or less.

So it would include news magazines, trade

10

journals, serially-issued comic books — there's a whole

11

laundry list of publications besides just newspapers

12

that this applies to.

13

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that encompass West?

14

MR. KEMPAINEN:

No, Your Honor, because most

15

West books do not come out at average intervals of three

16

months or less.

They come out a lot faster than

that, as far as I can see.

therefore, -- and what Minnesota did in 1971 when it was

searching for additional revenue, instead of eliminating

the total exemption from the sales tax for publications,

it instead went further back, in the commercial flow of

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

line, when the $100,000 exclusion came into effect, that

2

again was a point where the legislature was attempting

3

to be solicitous of First Amendment rights, especially

4

the First Amendment rights of small publications who

5

would generally have less of an ability to pay, who

6

impose fewer social costs upon society and therefore,

7

the legislature could reasonably conclude that it would

8

be more inequitable to have them pay this tax, the full

9

measure, than it would be for a larger publication.

10

But it did not do so through a technique which

11

simply exempted the small publications and then left the

12

full measure of the tax on the larger newspapers such as

13

the Star and Tribune.

14
15
16

QUESTIONi

Instead, it did so through —
Has the legislature made any

changes since this litigation began?
MR. KEMPAINEN;

No, it hasn't, Your Honor.

17

The $100,000 exclusion has remained the same.

And the

18

$100,000 exclusion applies equally and with the same

19

benefit to the Star and Tribune that it does to the

20

small publications.

21

The effect of the $100,000 exclusion was to

22

give the Star and Tribune an $8000 lessening of a tax

23

bill, a credit on its tax bill.

24

see how that, in the first place, can be considered any

kind of a penalty --

exemption of, say,

17

its face, but people wouldn’t have much difficulty

18

figuring out who would have to pay the tax.

19

$35,000.

MR. KEMPAINEN*

And I suppose

It’s perfectly neutral on

Well,

that’s true. Your Honor,

20

but that happens in a lot of cases.

In the state of

21

Minnesota, to take an example like you had from

22

Illinois, we had a tax on taconite tailings that were

23

dumped into bodies of water.

24

plant in the state of Minnesota that did that was

25

Reserve Mining Company.

Well, the only taconite

QUESTION;

2

Well, what about my question?

Do

3

you think if you did raise the exemption as I suggested,

4

it would still be constitutional?
MR. KEMPAINEN;

5
6

I'm sorry, I didn't quite

understand.
QUESTION;

7

The question is if the exemption or

8

the credit, whatever you call it, instead of being $4000

9

was $35,000, so the only two left were the papers in

10

Minneapolis and St. Paul.
MR. KEMPAINEN;

11

Yes, Your Honor, I think it

12

would still be constitutional.

As long as it was

13

non-content related and as long as there was no evidence

14

of suppresive legislative intent, which there is none in

15

this case.
And my point about being non-content related I

16
17

think brings me to the uncontested fact in this case

18

that Minnesota's use tax on paper and ink is non-content

19

related.

21

what the subject matter of the publication may be.

22

It applies equally and across the board to

Do you think the court in Grosjean

would have reached the same result absent Huey Long's

activities in Louisiana at that time?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the result in Grosjean, Your Honor, was a result of many

2

factors.

3

which was — and the suppressive intent was -- evidence

4

of that was overwhelming in the Grosjean case.

5

Court mentioned it in its opinion.

6

twice, that it was that purpose, it was that legislative

7

intent which had a bearing on its decision.

8

9

One of the factors was the legislative intent

And this

It mentioned it

Perhaps, though, the main part of the decision
was the fact that the legislative enactment in the

10

Grosjean case, the Louisiana statute there on its face

11

was discriminatory and was directly tied to a level of

12

circulation which made it entirely too close to the

13

British taxes on knowledge.

14

QUESTION;

Do you think this Court has to look

15

at the potential for abuse or control of the press in

16

the tax scheme in determining its validity?

17

MR. KEMPAINEN;

I think that’s true to a

18

certain extent, Your Honor.

But I think it's also well

19

to point out that in a couple of cases in the past which

20

upheld otherwise valid general schemes on regulation —

21

and I’m speaking now about Associated Press versus

22

National Labor Relations Board and I believe the other

23

one was Associated Press versus United States.

24

dissents in those cases also looked at future impact.

25

And they were concerned and they said so in their

The

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

dissents that application of the National Labor

2

Relations Act and application of the Sherman Antitrust

3

Act to newspapers would open up a small crack that may

4

not seem like much now, but then it would widen out and

5

pretty soon we wouldn't have any First Amendment left

6

whatsoever.
Of course, here we are over four decades later

7

8

and the National Labor Relations Act still applies to

9

newspapers and the First Amendment is just as strong as
I think you just have to — it's a consideration,

10

ever.

11

but I don't think it's all that important a

12

consideration.

13

here where there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever

14

that the legislature had any sort of suppressive intent

15

or was intended or out to get newspapers, or even big

16

newspa pers.

17

19

And especially in a case such as we have

QUESTION;

Of course, in your state you have

no formal legislative history ever, do you?
MR. KEMPAINEN;

That's correct, Your Honor.

20

The state of Minnesota does not make a practice, like

21

Congress does, of keeping a legislative history on any

22

formal basis.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

It would be helpful sometimes if

they did, I think.
MR. KEMPAINEN;

That’s true. Your Honor, if

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

they had the money to do so

2

legislatures, unlike Congress, don’t have the vast sums

3

at their availability and many states, Minnesota perhaps

4

and New Hampshire in particular I would think, the

5

general politics of the state just would make it

6

impossible for a legislature to spend the amount of

7

money that it would take to build up a legislative

8

record on every single piece of legislation that came

9

through it.

QUESTIONS

11

SR. KEMPAINEN:

15

But I think state

Some states do.
Some states do. Your Honor.

The larger ones, in particular.
QUESTION*

Why would it be particularly

difficult for New Hampshire?
MR. KEMPAINEN:

Oh, I just mentioned that.

Your Honor, because they're very much — I was reading

an article recently about —

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. KEMPAINEN:

Their assembly has 400 members.
Yes, it's a large assembly.

20

Your Honor, and they don't like taxes in New Hampshire.

21

There’s no income tax or sales tax in New Hampshire.

22

And the reason I mentioned that, Your Honor, is I read

23

an article about I believe some New Hampshire politician

24

failed to take the traditional "no tax” pledge and lost

25

the election.

Moving on to the Grosjean case in particular,

1

2

I think the only real case that the Star Tribune has

3

with regard to Grosjean is on this tax on knowledge

4

issue.

5

British stamp tax, it is not like the British tax on

6

advertisments, which were the only two taxes on

7

knowledge that the Grosjean court mentioned in its

8

opinion.

And yet, Minnesota's tax is simply not like the

The Star Tribune virtually conced es as much in

9

Instead, it

10

its own brief, that it was not a stamp tax.

11

tries to bring it into the same category as the British

12

tax on paper.
QUESTION*

13

I don't understand you r position to

14

be — I understand the position to be that in England,

15

the first set of taxes were very inocuous a nd they went

16

on and on and on.

17

And I understand the position to be that if they let

18

down and let you start this, in years to co me it might

19

get worse.

And eventually, they wen t too far.

Isn't that more what their argu ment is?
MR. KEMPAINEN t

20

That may be the S tar Tribune's

21

argument, that's true, Your Honor, but I do n't believe

22

that the history of the taxes on knowledge would support

23

that.

24
25

QUESTIONi

I only said I thought that was

their position.

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

*18. KEMPAINENs

1

Oh, yes. Your Honor.

In that

2

case, it might be.

But the history of the taxes cn

3

knowledge does not support that.

4

two passages from the Grosjean opinion itself, which

5

went into a very great amount of detail with regard to

6

the British taxes on knowledge.

All I need do is quote

In the Grosjean opinion on page 246 it says,

7
8

and I quote, "The main purpose of these taxes was to

9

suppress the publications of comments and criticisms

10

objectionable to the Crown,

does not admit of doubt.”

11

Later on in the same page this Court said, and I quote,

12

that "The taxes had and were intended to have the effect

13

of curtailing the circulation of newspapers, and

14

particularly, the cheaper ones whose readers were

15

generally found among the masses of people went almost

16

without question, even on the part of those who defended

17

the Act.”
This is this Court talking about the history

18
19

of the British stamp taxes and the British taxes on

20

knowledge.

21

And it may be true that insofar as British

22

history is concerned, their import duty on paper — or

23

rather, duty on paper — was used with that intention in

24

mind, and also coupled with the fact that the British

25

taxes on knowledge granted notoriously unfettered

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

discretion to the British administrations in the

2

collection of those taxes, thereby making them even

3

easier tools to use to suppress their political

4

opponents.

5

Those two facts together made the British

6

taxes on knowledge odious to American experience.

Of

7

course, in the case of Minnesota's use tax on paper and

8

ink, neither one of those facts are present here.

9

is no intent to suppress.

There

Revenue raising was not given

10

just lip service in Minnesota; it was the basic reason

11

for this, and it was part and parcel of the Minnesota

12

Miracle Act which was passed back in 1971.

13

course, there is no unfettered discretion in the

14

collection of the Minnesota use tax, as well.

15

QUESTION;

And, of

But let me just explore your

16

argument for a moment.

Supposing that in 1974, when you

17

passed the exemption, there was evidence that there was

18

a change in control of the legislature.

19

to know anything about Minnesota politics, but suppose

20

all the rural districts where these smaller newspapers

21

are mostly published happened to elect people, and they

22

then passed an exemption for the newspapers that

23

supported them, and that could be shown.

I don't happen

24

Would that make it a different case?

25

MR. KEMPAINENs

No, Your Honor.

Althouah it

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would make it a different case if, as Your Honor says,

2

this was an exemption.

3

an exclusion.

4

QUESTIONS

But it *s not an exemption; it's

Then go back to 71.

Suppose the

5

original tax, it could be shown that the governor and

6

the majority of the legislature were opposed by the

7

principal newspapers who would bear the burden of the

8

tax, and in their campaiga they explicitly said, we

9

think the newspapers ought to pay their fair share of

10

the public burden and all the rest of it.

11

there was a political debate on the issue.

12

make a difference?

13

MR. KEMPAINEN;

And then
Would that

I would suggest, Your Honor,

14

that this Court could use the Grosjean decision and

15

invalidate that tax, then.

16

QUESTION;

So we have to get into the politics

17

of the particular state to know whether a tax of this

18

kind is bad or not, then.

19
20

21

MR. KEMPAINENs

At least the legislative

history; not necessarily the politics. Your Honor.
Up until this point, we've talked primarily

22

about the issue as it is framed in terms of a violation

23

of the First Amendment per se, and we really haven't

24

talked too much about the equal protection issues.

25

would like to take the remainder of my time to talk

I

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

about the equal protection issues as they arise here.

2

I would like to -- Yes, Your Honor?

3

QUESTION

Could I ask just one other question

4

about this motive problem.

5

non-discriminatory sales tax; that this tax tha was put

6

into effect was one that just treated newspapers exactly

7

like all other businesses, so there was no singling

8

out.

9

was that the legislature didn't like the dominant paper

But it was also clear that the reason for doing it

10

in the state.

11

is —

12

Assume we had a totally

Would that be bad, too?

MR. KEMPAINEN;

How controlling

You mean they passed a general

13

sales tax on all businesses?

14

QUESTION;

Right.

Absolutely not

15

discriminating, but for a political motive.

16

motive controlling?

17

When is

I just wonder.

MR. XEMPAINENs

Well, I think that would be a

18

closer case, Your Honor, and I can only say that it’s

19

not the case here.

20

what would be the outcome of that case.

And I would hesitate to speculate on

21

With regard to the equal protection issue,

22

this was given some space in the briefs, and I think

23

rightly sc.

24

position here, as it has been throughout this

25

litigation,

I'd like to mention that our primary

is that the anti-rational basis standard of

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

review is the correct standard of review here to use.

2

This is because the -thing being taxed, the wholesale

3

commercial purchase of paper and ink, is simply not a

4

fundmental right so closely connected to actual

5

communicative acts that it requires the strict scrutiny

6

standard of review.

7

There's certainly no more of a fundmental

8

right than the Star and Tribune’s purchase of gasoline

9

or tires for its delivery trucks, which are subject to

10

the excise tax, or its purchase of desks and reporters,

11

desks and typewriters for its reporters, which has

12

always been subject to sales and use taxation in

13

Minnesota in any event.

14

and typewriters for its people, for its employees, has

15

to pay sales tax on those desks and typewriters.

16

Any business that buys desks

This is simply an incidental burden, an

17

incidental item of overhead, just like those other

18

incidental items, that any commercial business has to

19

absorb in the state of Minnesota and, indeed, in all

20

other states.

21

Therefore, we feel that it's sufficiently

22

remote from actual communicative acts so that where we

23

don’t deny that it may have some effect upon First

24

Amendment interests, it is not a fundamental effect

25

invoking strict scrutiny.

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

But having said that, I think I still want to

2

go on and talk about how this case can meet the strict

3

scrutiny standard of review in any event, because if it

4

meets strict scrutiny, it certainly meets the

5

anti-rational basis standard.

6

All the strict scrutiny standard of review

7

requires is that there be a legitimate and important

8

government purpose served by a statute which is

9

sufficiently tailored so as to achieve that purpose

10

without unduly restricting First Amendment interests and

11

actual communicative acts.

12

How, the original and basic use tax in this

13

case is so tailored.

It serves — it was enacted in

14

1971 to serve an important and fundamental governmental

15

interest, which is revenue raising for an important

16

social program, and it is sufficiently tailored so as to

17

get as far away from the actual communicative act of

18

printing and publishing a newspaper as possible, and at

19

the same time achieve its revenue-raising purpose by

20

taxing the wholesale purchase of paper and ink.

21

As for the $100,000 exclusion, of course, our

22

first position there is that it’s a benefit anyway, and

23

it's a benefit that applies equally and across the board

24

to all publications.

25

reason of the fact that during the years in question it

In fact, the Star and Tribune, by

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

had two editions, the morning edition and the evening

2

edition, it received two exclusions, getting a benefit

3

of $8,000 off its tax bill.
QUESTION;

MR. KEMPAINEN;

9

At what level does the sales tax

Do you think you pay a sales tax if

you buy something for 20 cents?
MR. KEMPAINEN;

10

It was at 9 cents or — .

It

11

was for anything less than 9 cents you did not have to

12

pay a sales tax.

13

correct but there was a level at a small level like that

14

where it cuts in.

And I'm not sure if that's still

QUESTION;

15

But do you think -- you think the

16

newspapers are normally sold at a level that's above the

17

cutoff.

18
19
20
21

MR. KEMPAINEN;

I know they are. Your Honor.

I buy mine all the time at 25 cents a copy.
QUESTION;

And anytime you buy something for

25 cents, unless it's exempt, you pay a sale tax.

22

MR. KEMPAINEN;

That’s correct. Your Honor.

23

We feel that there was a compelling reason, in

24

any event, for the $100,000 exclusion.

Even assuming

25

that it was discriminatory and was not -- and is subject

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to strict scrutiny.

That compelling reason being that

2

there was an equitable -- that a need for an equitable

3

system of taxation that took into account the special

4

problems of small newspapers.

5

achieved that by a tailored technique; namely, an

6

exclusion rather than an exemption.

7

credit, if you will, that was given equally and across

8

the board to all papers.
QUESTION;

9

And the legislature

An exclusion, a tax

10

about the special needs of small newspapers, but what is

small newspaper that prompted the exemption?

16

Yes.

You mean mainly, they couldn't

afford it?
MR. KEMPAINEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

They had a

20

hard time paying this, they had less of an ability to

21

pay, they were mainly located in rural areas, had a

22

smaller circulation and, therefore, had less chance for

23

advertising revenues.

24

that the legislature could have drawn on in order to

25

give a special —

There are any number of reasons

2

It was purely a financial break to

them.
MB. KEMPAINEN;

3

Yes, Your Honor.

But it was

4

also a financial break -- I wish to emphasize — that

5

was equally applicable to the large newspapers and the

6

large publications.
In summary, what we have here is a simple

7
8

revenue-raising statute.

It's non-content related, it's

9

not a license tax, it's not tied directly to

10

circulation, and it was not imposed with any improper

11

purpose, least of all a suppressive one.

12

classifications there are in that statute, they were

13

imposed with a view towards benefiting First Amendment

14

interests and for being solicitous toward them and not

15

with a view towards suppressing First Amendment

16

interests.

Whatever

Whether the anti-rational basis standard of

17
18

review is used under equal protection, we contend that

19

it should be the correct standard, or whether the strict

20

scrutiny standard of review is used, as the Minnesota

21

Supreme Court did below, this statute meets the

22

requirements of equal protection.
It is also not violative of the Grosjean case

23
24

or any other principles under the First Amendment per

25

se.

Accordingly, we feel that the law is constitutional

whether there have been any changes in the Minnesota

I point this out simply to note that there is

no comfort in the state’s argument of uniform rate,

because the legislature has now broken it down and rates

21

are no longer uniform.

22

The other point I’d like to make is Kr.

23

Kempainen stated that you must find bad motive in order

24

to invalidate the tax at issue, and what you do is you

25

look to legislative history in order to estalish bad

4^

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Well, we don't think bad motive is material to

1

motive

2

a First Amendment analysis, but the state of Minnesota

3

here has created a situation where we have no

legislative history.

5

If Mr. Kempainen's approach is correct, what

6

it means is that by not creating legislative history, a

state can insulate a tax on First Amendment activity,

and if bad motive is a requisite of proof you can never

prove it; therefore, you can never challenge it.
