CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Meth, I think you may proceed

when you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN S. METH, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

8

MR. METH:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here under the certiorari from the Court

9

of Appeals from the Ninth Circuit to review a decision of that

10

court which held that California did not have the authority to

11

regulate through licensing Indian country liquor transactions.

12

In so doing, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the

13

District Court which had upheld the right of California to

14

regulate through licensing Indian country liquor transactions.

15

This case asked the Court to resolve two well-established

16

and entirely distinct principles.

17

principle that Indians and Indian tribes are to be left free of

18

state control and their affairs governed by themselves and by

19

the United States.

20

On the one hand is the

The other principle is that it is the states which have

21

the authority to determine how liquor transactions within the

22

state's borders are to take place.

23

This case began about six years ago when Respondent,

24

who is a tribal Indian living on a reservation in a northern

25

part of San Diego County, the Pala Reservation, requested that she
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

be allowed to sell distilled spirits from her general store,

2

which is located on the Pala Indian Reservation.

3

request to the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control,

4

which has the authority under California law to require and enforce;

5

California's liquor licensing system.

6

She made the

The Department denied Respondent's request for an

7

exemption from California's liquor licensing laws, and Respondent

8

then filed suit in the District Court seeking injunctive and

9

declaratory ruling.

And, the basis for that suit was that as a

10

tribal Indian seeking to sell distilled spirits from her store

11

located in Indian country she was exempt from California's

12

liquor licensing laws.

13

The Department moved to dismiss the complaint or for

14

summary judgment, and the District Court agreed with the Depart­

15

ment that it had the authority to require licenses, and, therefore,

16

dismissed the complaint.

17

The case was then appealed to the Court of Appeals which,

18

after a lengthy stay in that Court, reversed the decision of

19

the District Court and held that California's liquor licensing

20

laws as opposed to its state substantive laws had no impact in

21

Indian country and need not be followed.

22

This case thus presents the question whether a state

23

has the authority to require tribal Indians to obtain a state

24

license if state law requires the license be obtained before

25

liquor transactions take place in Indian country.

QUESTION:

May I clarify one thing, Mr. Meth, at the

2

outset.

3

this case on any jurisdiction it might have obtained under public

4

Law 280?

The state of California does not base any reliance in

5

MR. METH:

That is correct.

6

QUESTION:

And, why is that?

7

MR. METH:

Public Law 280, as we read it, is a criminal

8

jurisdictional type of statute.

9

was soley for a license.

10

The request made in this case

QUESTION:

And, also some forms of civil jurisdiction,

12

MR. METH:

That is correct.

13

QUESTION:

Then, it is your position that it would

11

14
15

right?
Public Law 280 —

not encompass liquor licensing?
MR. METH:

The criminal and civil jurisdiction which

16

California has under Public Law 280 may come into play somewhere

17

further down the line if Respondent is required to obtain a

18

license and then doesn't act/which is both punishable under the

19

licensing system and the criminal system.

20

under the criminal system, Public Law 280 would give California

21

the authority to punish that act criminally.

22

If it is punishable

But, as far as the disciplinary action which California

23

through the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control would take

24

against Respondent under the licensing system, that authority,

25

we believe, is contained in Section 1161.

applicable in the state of California?

Well, in any event, Public Law 280 is

MR. METH:

That is correct.

California is a Public Law

QUESTION:

It is not just limited to criminal juris­

280 state.

diction, is it?
MR. METH:

No, civil jurisdiction, as this Court con­

8

strued Public Law 280 in Bryan that it relates to criminal and

9

civil, but civil jurisdiction was limited by the Court to causes

10

of action cases where a court's services were required, and it

11

excluded —

12
13

QUESTION:

That was because of the Bryan interpretation

that you opted to drop any reliance on 280, is that right?

14

MR. METH:

15

Before 1953 this question would not have arisen, for

That is correct.

16

the simple fact that Indian country was dry.

17

federal legislation prohibited the introduction of liquor into

18

Indian country.

19

Beginning in 1802,

In 1832, the prohibitions were made criminal.

So,

20

under federal law, as well as state law, a number of states also

21

regulated liquor transactions with Indians.

22

liquor transactions with Indians either on the reservation or

23

off the reservation were prohibited.

24
25

Beginning in 1832,

The federal prohibitions are now contained in 18 U.S.C.
Sections 1154 and 1156.

In 1953, Congress passed 18 U.S.C. Sectio

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

1161, which removed the federal criminal penalties unconditionally

2

if the transaction occurred off the reservation.

3

on the reservation, acts or transactions occurring in Indian

4

country, the federal penalties were removed conditionally, the

5

conditions being that the acts or transactions had to conform

6

both with the laws of the state in which the acts or transactions

7

occurred and an ordinance duly adopted by the tribe having

8

jurisdiction over that area of Indian country.

9

With respect to

The Department asserted in the District Court and the

10

District Court agreed that California had the authority to require

11

Respondent to obtain a license.

12

with respect to what it actually says, I think it is very impor­

13

tant for the Court to consider what the statute does not say in

14

light of the Court of Appeals' decision.

15

Before I analyze Section 1161,

The Court of Appeals' decision was based primarily on

16

the concept of jurisdiction, and as I have indicated before,

17

California is not asserting criminal or civil jurisdiction in

18

the Public Law 280 sense under this statute.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

May I ask you then, what is California's

view about—Assume you prevail, how will you enforce your victory?
MR. METH:

California's liquor licensing laws are

22

enforced administratively.

23

the Department of Alcoholic —

QUESTION:

A license is in effect a decision by

I understand, but supposing your opponent

decides just to start selling liquor.

What can you do about it?

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

MR. METH:

The sale of liquor without a license in

California is a crime.

3

QUESTION:

I understand.

4

MR. METH:

I would think that the local district attorney

The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has no
QUESTION:

criminal —

That only applies to California territorial

land, doesn't it?

8

MR. METH:

Pardon me?

9

QUESTION:

Well, is the Indian reservation part of the

10

territorial land of California?

11

MR. METH:

Yes it is, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

News to me.

13

QUESTION:

I am still not sure I understand the answer

14

to my question.

15

somebody sells liquor without a license on an Indian reservation.

Let me give you two questions.

One, supposing

16

Secondly, suppose someone who may have a license on an

17

Indian reservation violates some after-hours, sells at the wrong

18

time of day, or something like that.

19

about either of those situations?

20
21

22

MR. METH:

What can California do

There are two ways that California enforces

its liquor laws.
The primary way is through licensing, and in that way

23

the Department can take action against the license and if it

24

determines that there has been a violation of the alcoholic

25

beverage control law, then the Department can suspend, for a short
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

period of time, the license, the business operation, or the

2

Department can revoke the license and put the licensee out of

3

business.

4

The alternative method is if the local district attorney

5

decides that if the act is a criminal offense, and as His Honor

6

mentioned, after-hours sale is a criminal act, the district attorney

7

could take —

8
9

QUESTION:

You mean the federal attorney, or the

California attorney?

10

MR. METH:

California attorney under Public Law 280.

11

QUESTION:

Are you — Oh, I see, under Public Law 280

12

you would enforce even the jurisdiction that is left under the

13

Court of Appeals holding criminally in the state courts?

14

MR. METH:

That is correct.

15

QUESTION:

It would also be a federal crime?

16

MR. METH:

That is correct.

17

QUESTION:

You also enforce the laws about obscene

18
19

dancing in a liquor place on an Indian reservation?
MR. METH:

Off the reservation, those penalties or

20

those prohibitions are contained in the Department's regulations.

21

The Department is the California licensing agency.

22

If the Court of Appeals' decision is upheld, the

23

California licensing agency would not have any authority in

24

Indian country, and so those regulations, I submit, would not be

25

the kinds of things that if Respondent violated — If Respondent
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

were operating a bar instead —

2

QUESTION:

Without that, you could.

4

MR. METH:

The only way that —

5

QUESTION:

That you could enforce on an Indian reserva-

3

That is your

position?

6

tion the regulation of the California liquor board that you cannot

7

have obscene dancing in a place that sells liquor —

8

MR. METH:

That is correct.

9

QUESTION:

And, you can enforce that?

10

MR. METH:

Only administratively, Your Honor.

It is not a crime —

Only by

11

action against the licensee.

12

the Department's regulations, and those regulations are not crimes.

13

So, by virtue of the limited authority that the Court of Appeals

14

has given the Department, a violation of one of those regulations

15

would not result in a federal crime.

16

federal criminal sanctions against nude dancing.

Those prohibitions are contained in

So, there would not be any

17

QUESTION:

I did not mention federal.

18

MR. METH:

It is not a state crime either.

19

I said state.
If they are

Obscene dancing —

MR. METH:

Those are contained —

I thought a case came up here from

California —

24

MR. METH:

California versus LaRue —

25

QUESTION:

I thought so.
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. METH:

— in 1972.

2

QUESTION:

And, we upheld it, didn't we?

3

MR. METH:

The Department's regulations —

4

QUESTION:

That was a state rule, not federal.

5

MR. METH:

But it was a state regulatory rule —

6

QUESTION:

All I am saying is the courts will enforce

7

that rule on an Indian reservation.

8
9

The Court upheld —

MR. METH:
to require licensing.

If the Court gives the Department the authorij
If the Department does not have the

10

authority to license and to take action against the license, those

11

prohibitions cannot be enforced.

12

between the criminal system of enforcing the Alcoholic Beverage

13

Control Act and the administrative system for implementing that

14

Act.

That is the basic distinction

15

Only regulations promulgated by the Department which

16

are not crimes could not be determined to be substantive state

17

standards which the Court of Appeals has said are those matters

18

which result in federal crimes.

19

scheme of the Department would be inapplicable.

20

So, the entire regulatory

The only other case to reach this Court involving

21

Section 1161 is United States versus Mazurie in 1975.

22

that that is a very important case on the matter of this juris­

23

diction.

24
25

I believe

In that case non-Indians were convicted of. the federal
offense of violating Section 1154 because they had not obtained
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

tribal licenses.

2

liquor in an Indian reservation on that Indian reservation had to

3

obtain a tribal license.

4

so they were in conformity with the state law, but they had not

5

obtained tribal licenses.

6

The tribal ordinance required that anyone selling

The Mazuries obtained state licenses and

By virtue of that act, not obtaining tribal licenses,

7

the tribal license, they were convicted in federal court of

8

violating Section 1154.

9

All California is asking is to have the same power.

10

The tribes in that situation in Mazurie did not have criminal

11

jurisdiction over the non-Indians.

12

Oliphant made that clear.

13

This Court's decision in

The jurisdiction was not an issue, and it should not

14

be an issue.

15

which we know has jurisdiction over Indian country liquor trans­

16

actions and, in fact, all acts committed on an Indian reservation

jurisdiction over Respondent because she is an Indian.

The only authority, the only governmental entity

The United States has

In this case the United States has the jurisdiction.

21

In this case, all we are saying, all California is saying is that

22

it has the authority to set the conditions under which lawful

23

Indian country liquor transactions are to take place, and if state

24

law requires a license, just like if a tribal ordinance requires

25

a license, then the person desiring to engage in liquor traffic

2

case is about.

3

That is all this

I suggest the proper way to analyze this case is the

4

way this Court did in a number of cases cited in both of the

5

briefs, California versus the United States, EPA versus State

6

Water Resources Control Board, and Hancock versus Train.

7

three of those cases, the Court was faced with a situation where

8

a state was requiring a federal agency to obtain a license.

9

In all

In each of those cases, the Court looked at the statute,

10

looked at the entire statutory scheme, looked at the legislative

11

history and looked at anything else that the Court thought was

12

relevant to this situation.

California has the power to require a license.

But, the Court did not base its

That is all we are asking for in this case is for the

I do not believe it would be fruitful at all for the
Court to go into the matter of jurisdiction.
The Court of Appeals seemed to assume that the

24

California license was nothing more than a piece of paper, which

25

simply allows someone to do an act.

California's liquor licensing

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

scheme is much more than that, and I do not believe that the

2

Court's decision that only a state's substantive standards as

3

opposed to its licensing scheme is a valid one.

4

California both in its Constitution and in its statutes

5

has declared that a licensing system is necessary for the protecti

6

of the health, welfare, safety and keeps the morals of its people,

7

and the system is designed to eliminate what it views as the evils

8

of unlicensed liquor traffic within the state.

9
10

QUESTION:

Can non-Indians purchase liquor at these

establishments?

11

MR. METH:

Yes, they can, Your Honor.

The statute is

12

not limited with respect to the identity of the seller or the

13

identity of the buyer.

14

in Indian country, and anyone can buy under this statute, assuming

15

that the sale is in conformity with tribal and state laws.

16

So, anyone can sell under this statute

California has also declared that its licensing system

17

involves in the highest degree — and I am reading from the words

18

of the statute — in the highest degree the economic, social and

19

moral well-being and safety of the state and all of its people.

20

In light of what California believes, I wonder how the

21

Court of Appeals can say that a licensing system is something

22

that can be ignored.

23

regulatory system of liquor traffic, and I think it is quite

24

important for the state to be able to impose its licensing

25

system.

It is an important aspect of California's

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Meth, wasn't the principle reason that

2

the Court of Appeals found against you, its conclusion that 1161

3

was not an express grant of legislative jurisdiction to the states

4

to regulate liquor sales on reservations?

5

MR. METH:

That is eventually what the Court said.

6

QUESTION:

So that any observations it might have had

7

or might have had in the back of its mind about the importance of

8

a California liquor license I would think would probably be

9

secondary to that conclusion, don't you?

10

MR. METH:

The Court analyzed — I am not sure how

11

the Court analyzed the statute.

12

tion.

13

I would like to make an observa­

The Court analyzed the words of the statute in the

14

beginning of the opinion.

15

None of the briefs submitted by Respondent, or the United States

16

or any other amici have that interpretation of the statute.

17

words of the statute have been adopted, and I suggest that that

18

is so because the Court of Appeals' reading of the statute was

19

not understandable.

20

In none of the briefs cited by —

I have read that opinion many times.

The

I do not under­

21

stand how the Court can arrive at the conclusions it did based

22

upon the wording of the statute.

23

The Court then drew a distinction between licensing and

24

substantive state standards, but the Court nowhere defined the

25

phrase substantive state standards.

What we are saying is that

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

there are many substantive state standards, basic policies, as

2

Respondent put it in her brief.

3

which are contained in the licensing system and are not

4

simply criminal statutes.

5

There are many basic policies

For those reasons, we believe that the entire state

6

regulatory system and not simply what are called state substantive

7

standards without definition are to be followed in Indian country.

8

If I can give some examples — Perhaps the most impor­

9

tant policy with respect to retail sales of liquor in California

10

is the proposition that there should not be a liquor store or

11

bar on every corner.

12

people who are engaged in the sale of distilled spirits.

13

California tries to limit the number of

16

population.

That is based on

17

Another way is for the Department — The Department is

18

given the authority to determine if a particular location is the

19

proper location for a retail liquor establishment.

QUESTION:

The Depart­

Would you think that the Department would

know what was going on in an Indian reservation?

QUESTION:

Does it have one on the Indian reservation?

Of course, they do not.

MR. METH:

That is correct.

6

QUESTION:

So, how would they know?

7

MR. METH:

The Department has investigators, and the

8

Department's investigators —

9

QUESTION:

Indians?

10

MR. METH:

There is nothing in the statutes which would

prohibit an Indian from being an investigator.

12

QUESTION:

My question was, do they have any Indians?

13

MR. METH:

I do not know if any of the employees are

15

QUESTION:

You know they don't, don't you?

16

MR. METH:

Pardon me?

17

QUESTION:

Don't you know that they don't have any?

18

MR. METH:

I do not know that, Your Honor.

14

Indians —

There would

19

be nothing in the statutes which would prohibit the Department

20

from hiring Indians.

21

QUESTION:

22

with somebody else.

23

MR. METH:

If you prohibit them, you might be in trouble

That is certainly correct, Your Honor.

They

24

have other agencies of the state which would prohibit that sort

25

of activity, and California as an employer has traditionally been

QUESTION:

Well, for example, do you have a rule in

California that says you cannot have one near a church?

4

MR. METH:

That is correct.

5

QUESTION:

How many churches do you have on the

6

reservations?

7

MR. METH:

Your Honor, there are 75 to 80 reservations

in the state of California.

of the churches are.

I am sure you don't, and I doubt anybody

That is my point.
MR. METH:

An investigator can drive up to a reservation

and determine if the proposed license is to be —

14

QUESTION:

And decide what is best for the Indians?

15

MR. METH:

For the people of the state of California,

16
17
18

not just the Indians.
QUESTION:

You indicated earlier these stores would

sell to non-Indians, I assume.

19

MR. METH:

That is correct.

20

QUESTION:

And there are some checkerboard reservations,

21

22
23
24
25

aren't there?
MR. METH:

That is correct, Agua Caliente being a

prime example.
QUESTION:

Well, they are getting their liquor from

the same Oklahoma place that the California wholesalers wanted

to get it from in that Oklahoma connection case, aren't they?
MR. METH:

I do not know where the Agua Calientes are

getting their liquor.
QUESTION:

California has amended its laws, I take it,

5

to make it possible for wholesalers to sell to unlicensed

6

establishments on the reservation?

7

MR. METH:

That is correct.

So, that would eliminate

8

one of the enforcement methods that California has for preventing

9

the unlawful sales by non-licensees.

10

QUESTION:

But, California has kept on the books, at

11

least, its requirements that these establishments be licensed so

12

you assert it is not moot?

13

MR. METH:

That is correct, Your Honor.

14

QUESTION:

Does California regulate the price of

15

liquor sold in its liquor stores?

16

MR. METH:

No, it does not, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION:

It does regulate the hours during which they

18
19

20

may be sold, I suppose?
MR. METH:

That is correct.

Sales cannot be between

2 a.m. and 6 a.m.

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

MR. METH:

And, to just follow that up for a moment, it

23

does not seem to me that it makes much sense to draw a distinction

24

between the hours of operation in which Respondent and the United

25

States seem to say are ones which California may regulate and the

MR. METH:

MR. METH

Not in the licensing scheme, that is correct.

QUESTION

Well, or any other way?

MR. METH

Well, the —

QUESTION

They do not concede that?

14

MR. METH

They are conceding that under 1161 —

It would be a federal crime. —

16

MR. METH

A federal crime.

17

QUESTION

They do not concede that California can do

18

anything at all about it if the store owner was selling to

19

minors?

20

MR. METH:

That is correct.

However, California could

21

enforce those laws under Public Law 280, but as I said before,

22

Public Law 280 is not involved in this case.

Amendment aspect of the case was not argued below?

MR. METH:

It was not argued by California in the

We did not — California did not respond

to the 21st

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN V. QUESENBERRY, ESQ.

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18

However, when the case was consolidated

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Thank you, Justice Burger, and may

it please the Court:

19

The state has taken inconsistent positions in this case

20

as Mr. Meth has indicated, first asserting clear jurisdiction

21

under this statute and then moving to a position where we are at

22

today.

23

incorporates an entire state licensing scheme as a condition for

24

immunizing persons who engage in liquor transactions on Indian

25

reservations to federal criminal prosecutions.

The state is saying that this federal criminal statute

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2
3

I would like to go directly to the words of that
statute and the language that we are dealing with today, the
in conformity with state laws language.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Quesenberry, do you basically agree with

5

the Court of Appeals contruction of that relevant part of that

6

statute?

7

MR. QUESENBERRY:

8

The in conformity with language modifies the statement

9

Yes, we do, Justice Rehnquist.

that acts or transactions within Indian country shall be in

10

conformity with state law and with a tribal ordinance.

11

in conformity with language is a convenient technique that

12

Congress has used in other contexts, other contexts involving

13

federal penal statutes, the Assimilated Crimes Act and the Major

14

Crimes Act, to utilize state law as a standard for determining

15

whether that conduct may or may not violate federal law.

16

That

This Court in cases under other federal statutes,

17

the federal Water Pollution Control Act and the federal Clean

18

Air Act, where Congress has used language, shall conform with

19

state law, has said that that means that state standards, state

20

law would serve as standards for regulating federal facilities,

21

but by no measure would require those facilities to obtain a

22

state license.

23

When Congress passed this statute, its overriding

24

concern was to eliminate discrimination against Indians in the

25

sale of alcoholic beverages.

So, it is reasonable to look at this

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

statute and the act or transactions language and imply or assume

2

that Congress was concerned about the sale or use of alcohol

3

within Indian country, and by no means was concerned with matters

4

such as licensing and taxation of liquor within Indian country.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Quesenberry, what is the effect, in your

6

view, of the in conformity language insofar as it talks about

7

conformity with the laws of the state in which such act or

8

transaction occurs?

9

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Our position is that that language

10

deals with — that that language applies state law to the sale

11

or use of alcohol.

12

drunkards, sale during hours —

That is sales to minors, sales to habitual

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Well, how was that state law to be enforced?
That state law is to be enforced

15

through the United States Attorney or through some type of

16

action brought by the tribe.

17

ment authority under its own ordinance if there was a violation,

18

but essentially the violation of state standards would be

19

enforced by the United States Attorney.

The tribe would have civil enforce­

20

As to a situation where a non-Indian was selling in

21

violation of a state standard, for example selling to minors,

22

the state has criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians under

23

McBratney and Draper, very early decisions by this Court.

24

state seems to imply in its reply brief that it does not have

25

that type of jurisdiction —

The

QUESTION:

But only criminal jurisdiction — You would

2

have to go through the processes of trying to get criminal

3

prosecutions as opposed to some kind of suspension of the license

4

or other disciplinary action as an administrative matter, in

5

your view, and under the view of the CA 9?

6

MR. QUESENBERRY:

There is an additional mechanism here

7

and that is the Federal Indian Traders Laws.

8

doing business on the reservation would be required to comply

9

with those laws, and they would be licensed —

10

QUESTION:

Any non-Indian

Well, provided the state authorities could

11

convince the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs to take some kind

12

of action?

13

MR. QUESENBERRY:

14

QUESTION:

15

Let me ask you, this statute, 1161, arose really out

16

of situation that existed in the state of Arizona, did it not?

17
18
19

In that particular situation, yes.

And that may be quite a difficult task.

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Yes, it was initially designed just

to apply to a single state.
QUESTION:

Right, and later in the process of the

20

congressional hearings it was expanded to encompass other states

21

as well and to remove the disabilities that the federal law had

22

imposed on the use and possession of alcohol on reservations?

23

MR. QUESENBERRY:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is correct.

And, during the course of the legislative

history there was some indication, at least, by, I think, then
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Representative John Rhodes and maybe others, it was their under­

2

standing that state laws would then apply in the liquor area,

3

right?

4

MR. QUESENBERRY:

5

QUESTION:

Yes, the idea of state laws applying.

And, the thing that concerns me a little bit

6

about the history, which is far from clear, of course, is that

7

at least in Arizona where all of this emerged many of the

8

reservations are right there in urban areas, in Scottsdale, in

9

the heart of Scottsdale, all along the Colorado River where there

10

are now casinos developing and quite a population area.

11

you think that Congress may have been concerned about applying

12

the full state administrative mechanism in those areas?

13

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Do

I cannot really respond to that because

14

Congress was very unclear in articulating its overall intent.

15

did not tell us a great deal about its intent, so we have the

16

language of the statute.

17

It

We also have the strong federal policies that have

18

protected Indian reservations, particularly tribal members, from

19

incursions- of state jurisdiction.

20

QUESTION:

If you say — If you concede what you do

21

that the Indian trader selling liquor would have to comply with

22

the state laws except for licensing, hours and that sort of

23

thing, why couldn’t the state, although it would not have any,

24

under your theory, would not have any licensing leverage, why

25

couldn't it go to a state court and enjoin a persistent course of
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

conduct in violation of state law and not just rely on the United

2

States Attorney who would probably tell him to go piddle his

papers?

MR. QUESENBERRY:

If the state — If there is a viola­

That is a state criminal statute. Nobody

14
15

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Why shouldn't the state be able to

I cannot answer why or why not.

I

can answer that it is my opinion that based on the legislative

16

history of 1161 and Public Law 280 that Public Law 280 was focused

17

on a grant of criminal jurisdiction to the states.

18

one was part of Public Law 280.

19

280 because of the concern by Indian people that the acceptance

20

of criminal jurisdiction, the repeal of liquor was tied to the

21

acceptance of criminal jurisdiction.

22

Eleven sixty-

It was pulled out of Public Law

I would say that if the violation was directly related

23

to a transaction in liquor that the exclusive enforcement procedure

24

against an Indian person that was violating would be by federal

statute or by tribal action against that person.

that under the 21st Amendment.

QUESTION:

6

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Why didn't you bring it up a minute ago?
Well, the cases that this Court has

decided have said that you cannot allow a state to regulate on

8

military reservations.

9

don't see the case distinguishing those —

10

QUESTION:

We don't see any of those cases — We

I frankly don't see where a state gets a

11

right to regulate the liquor drinking on a reservation by

12

Indians.

13

15

MR. QUESENBERRY:

We are not conceding that.

In fact,

that is specificially what I am saying, Your Honor.
We do not concede that type of regulation.

remedy in the event that one of the standards is violated in the

correctly, that the Indians must obey those state standards that

you agree are applicable within the reservation?

QUESTION:

We definitely —

There are some state standards, and you are

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

You are

MR. QUESENBERRY:

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

What about state standards that are merely

implementations of a licensing requirement, such as those things

that they say if you do A, B, and C, then your license may be

5

revoked, but there is no criminal state sanctions.

6

binding, or not, under your view?

7

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Are they

They would not be binding.

Under

8

our view what we are saying, and let me clarify it, is that the

9

determinations leading up to the actual sale of liquor, the

10

unique determinations of licensing and the qualifications of

11

the licensee, the determination of whether these premises are

12

fit for liquor to be sold, are within the prerogative of the

13

tribal governmental authority under Section 1161.

14

QUESTION:

And that would include, for example, method

of operation, for example, the problem Justice Marshall brought

the liquor is sold and the actual sale or use of liquor.

QUESTION:

But what if those that Justice Brennan gave

4

you were not in any state statute but were merely in regulations

5

promulgated by the liquor authority saying that every licensee

6

must do the following or his license will be revoked.

7

under your view, they would not be enforceable, as I understand

8

you.

9

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Then,

I think in that situation you would

10

have to just ask if that is a determination that is leading up

11

to the ultimate grant of the license.

12

QUESTION:

Well, assume it is, that the only source of

13

state law is that if you do not follow these rules your license

14

will be revoked.

15

That is our hypothesis.

MR. QUESENBERRY:

I agree with you.

I think that if

16

you say that it is part of their regulatory structure, I would

17

say that Congress in enacting this federal penal statute did

18

not intend to incorporate this whole state civil regulatory

MR. QUESENBERRY:

In this particular situation —

What particular situation?
In the situation presented by Justice

Stevens that it would turn on that because the state standard
31

in that particular hypothetical was tied to the administrative

in the specific statute imposing a criminal penalty.

That is what this case is about—

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. QUESENBERRY:

That is what I thought.
That is what this case is about.

13

We contend that the statute by no means is a grant of any type

14

of licensing authority, nor does it impose the state licensing

15

requirements by way of this in conformity with language.

16

In our briefs we go into discussion of the previous

17

decisions by this case, including the Moe decision which dealt

18

with state licensing, cigarette vendors license.

19

particular case did not have a specific federal statute such as

20

we have in this particular instance.

21

Now, that

But, we do not see any clear indication in the legis­

22

lative history or in the language of the statute that Congress

23

intended to impose a state civil regulatory scheme as a con­

24

dition —

25

QUESTION:

But, they certainly did decide in 1161 to
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

treat liquor transactions differently than cigarette transactions

2

and that sort of thing, which really are not covered by a specific

3

statute.

4

MR. QUESENBERRY:

That is correct, and that was against the

5

backdrop of total federal preemption of the area of liquor trade.

6

This Court in Mazurie held that there was a valid delegation of

7

congressional authority to tribes, which as a group exercised some

8

inherent, independent authority over both the territory, the

9

members, and the subject matter.

10

QUESTION:

But Mazurie was basically an argument between

a private individual and the federal government prosecuting as

on the basis of an Indian regulation and argue unlawful delegation

and that sort of thing.

Mazurie at all.

15

The state, Wyoming, was not involved in

MR. QUESENBERRY:

No, I think they may have participated

16

as a amicus, but there was no real conflict between the state and

17

the tribe because there was a state license that was required by

18

virtue of tribal ordinance, in fact, in that case.

19

point out that in that case Indian tribal members were subject

20

only to a tribal licensing requirement.

Essentially what the state — We see the state's

trying to gain control?

Why do you suppose it took so long for this issue to get here?

3

I know there was an Interior Department opinion in 1971 that

4

indicated that you were correct.

5

to get these licenses, before that 1971 —

6

not understand why it takes 30 years for this issue to arise.

7

This statute was passed 30 years ago.

MR. QUESENBERRY:

Before that had anybody tried
What took — I do

I think that part of the answer to

8

that is that Indian reservations are beginning to experience

9

economic development.

10
11

They have been suppressed for a long time.

Tribal governments are developing.

They are regulating

more, and we have a situation where non-Indian communities and

12

14
15

Indian communities are maybe closer together.
We have tribal authority being exerted to a greater
extent than it was before.

was no attempt to get any liquor license within an Indian

reservation?

MR. QUESENBERRY:

I cannot really answer that.

I do

not have the facts to answer that question.

and punish them for a crime?

Now, could the Indian be prosecuted

Our contention would be that they

could not, that Public Law 280, that 1161 was pulled outside of

treated differently historically by Congress and that the remedy

is through the federal enforcement scheme.

QUESTION:

But, only the federal government can enforce

them?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, as we understand it, we would

13

suggest that certain state laws which do not have any licensing

14

related terms that say in the absolute, no person may sell

15

alcohol to a minor, or give alcohol to a minor at certain hours

16

are pure criminal statutes and are not the kind of essentially

17

a subterfuge —

18

QUESTION:

But the state could revoke the license if

19

these regulations were violated?

20

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Our view is that the state lacks licensing

21

authority so that a pure criminal violation would in California

22

because it is a Public Law 280 state could actually be prosecuted

23

by the state.

24

QUESTION:

It is the government's view —

You say that he may be prosecuted.

That is

not just to some extent.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SCHWARTZ:

If I may, Mr. Justice White —

You may.
There are — Section 1161 and Public

12

280 were passed on the same day by Congress.

13

common background, and it is necessary to sort out a sensible

14

in pari materia construction of the two.

15

Law

They do have a

We would submit that a state may not, given that

16

background, pass a statute, as California, in fact, has, that

17

says it is a misdemeanor to sell liquor without one of our

18

licenses because that would totally frustrate the sense of Section

19

1161, even though that is on its face a criminal violation.

20

I take it that was what fueled Justice O'Connor's question.

21

On the other hand, it is our sense that some criminal

22

violations which are written in the absolute and they are not

23

tied to the requirement of a license may fairly be regarded as

24

distinct and true criminal proscriptions and that those may be

25

enforced by the state.

If that is in conflict with private
37

counsel's answer, so be it, Justice White.

2

QUESTION:

Well it is.

3

QUESTION:

Counsel, the statute says, "no one Indian

4

or otherwise in the state of California may sell liquor to a

5

minor."

Can that be enforced?

6

MR. SCHWARTZ:

7

QUESTION:

8

I would think that it could.

By the state?

They could send in an officer

and arrest?

9

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Pursuant to Public Law 280, Justice

10

Marshall, because California is a Public Law 280 state and does

11

have some jurisdiction which permeates the reservation, that is

12

not resting on the statute which is the focus of this case.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SCHWARTZ:

15

QUESTION:

16

But that statute could be enforced?
That would be our understanding.

How far would you go?

Where are you going

to draw the line now?

17

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Well, one line that we would clearly

18

draw is that no proscription which is tied by the state in its

19

own scheme to possession of a license may be enforced in that

20

manner because that must be regarded as part of the regulatory

21

scheme.

22

QUESTION:

There is also a regulation by the state

23

liquor board which says that nobody operating a licensee place

24

shall sell to a minor.

invalid?

Would that make the criminal statute

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. SCHWARTZ:

2

QUESTION:

I am not sure I understand the question.

I do.

You say the difference is between

3

whether it is criminal or it is a regulation.

4

one that you have both.

5

MR. SCHWARTZ:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I have given you

Mr. Justice Marshall —

Now, are they both good, or is one good?
Let me try this and see if this will

8

answer your question.

9

depends on whether something is embodied in a regulation or a

10

state statute.

Our view is not that the distinction

Let us be clear about that.

11

We suppose that for purposes of Section 1161 if the

12

state of California delegates to an administrative agency the

13

authority to enact a regulation proscribing terms of conduct in

14

general terms not depending on whether or not you hold one of

15

their licenses or not, that that is part of the state law.

16

that state law is criminal, then California being a Public Law

17

280 state it may be enforced.

18

If

But, whether or not the state is a Public Law 280 state

19

because it is part of the terms of state law which must be

20

conformed to, the federal sanction does apply.

21

If I have not helped you, come back at me.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I just do not understand how you say

23

that you can do one by merely putting the word criminal on it.

24

Unless you put criminal on it, it does not work.

25

MR. SCHWARTZ:

The answer is in part that Public
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Law 280, which stands outside this case, says that the state shall

2

have certain criminal jurisdiction.

3

California has a system whereby certain acts are proscribed only

4

through the licensing scheme, but should the state wish to,

5

proscribe those acts in general terms, those would be incorporated

6

within the Section 1161 structure.

7

QUESTION:

Now, the state as —

Does that mean then — You do take a

8

different view.

9

dancing in a liquor establishment, and anyone who violates

Say they have a regulation that says, no obscene

10

this regulation can have his license revoked, but there is no

11

criminal prohibition against it.

12

not, in Indian reservations?

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Is that enforcible, or is it

I think we would say not because the

14

sanction is license revokation, but the same regulation could

15

be written a different way to accomplish the same effect.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Do you find that in the text of 1161, that

distinction?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

No, Justice Stevens — In an indirect

19

sense we do.

20

authorize the state to regulate through licensure.

21

it cannot do any of these things indirectly through licensure.

What our contention is that Section 1161 does not

If it wishes to enact laws —

QUESTION:

That means

Well, but would you say that a person who

1161?

3

California law.

You say it is, even though it violates a plain rule of

4

MR. SCHWARTZ:

The answer is whether that plain rule

5

is a rule that says, our licensees may not permit such conduct

6

or whether, on the other hand —

7

QUESTION:

No, the question is whether the person

8

within the meaning of 1161 has been acting in conformity with

9

state law.

10
11

That is what that statute says.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

In conformity with state law, we under­

stand to mean —

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Conforming with some state laws?
If you will, Justice Stevens, but the

14

point is that licensing is a very different kind of authority

15

to exercise and that the state can accomplish the same objective

16

through enacting general purpose standards.

17

What is offensive, if I may, about the licensing,

18

regulatory authority that the state claims, is its discretionary

19

element, as well as the fact that a tax is being imposed.

20

substantial fee is exacted before for the privilege of doing

21

business on the reservation.

22

QUESTION:

Well, the Court of Appeals did not really

23

base its holding on the theory that it was a tax which the

24

government had argued, did it?

25

The

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I think it is fair to say that the
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Court of Appeals did not base its holding on it.

2

reject it.

3

It did not

It simply did not rely on it.
What we would lay emphasis on, Justice O'Connor, is

4

the discretionary element.

5

operating a licensing scheme the state does not disavow the full

6

range of discretionary powers that exist under a licensing scheme.

It is useful to actually look at the California statutes

It is important to understand that in

13

to investigate all matters affecting the public welfare or morals,

14

and it has been held under California law that a license may be

15

denied on the basis of a determination respecting these con­

16

siderations .

17
18
19

The Department is enjoined

The statute also incorporates other relatively vague
criteria.
QUESTION:

But, suppose those criteria were made

20

specific, such as you cannot get a license if you are convicted

21

of a felony.

22

cannot sell liquor if you have been convicted of a felony.

23

That law could be enforced in the other state but not California,

24

as I understand it.

25

Another state,1 not California, has a law that you

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, Justice Stevens, and I would draw

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

an analogy here to the Court's decision in the Grendalls Den

2

case.

3

then those criteria come outside the realm of discretionary

4

administration and then they are part of the laws of the state

5

for purposes of Section 1161.

If a state chooses to make its criteria unconditional

6

If the state makes the choice to insist on retaining

7

discretion to sort these factors out for itself then the con­

8

sequence under Section 1161 is that that is not part of the law

9

of the state.

10

QUESTION:

Do you find any support for this in either

11

the language of the statute or the legislative history, this

12

rather subtle distinction?

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Justice Stevens, if I may, a one sen­

14

tence answer — The key thing in our view is that there is no

15

support for the rather remarkably intrusive authority that the

16

state does claim.

the state is consistent with a traditional pattern.

21

It treats them exactly like it treats the people who

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes, but I think it is common ground here

22

that those who live on Indian reservations may not in general be

23

treated the same way absent federal authority, and that is why we

24

draw that distinction.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose you could have argued just
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

simply that the federal laws on Indian traders preempted in this

2

area but not make the further distinction that you appear to be

3

trying to make.

4

MR. SCHWARTZ:

We think that — An argument that the

5

state has no authority whatsoever because of the federal Indian

6

trader statutes would be difficult to reconcile with the fact

7

that Congress does appear to have recognized some role for the

8

states in Section 1161.

satisfactory and certainly not lucidly clear, is the best way

10

we can find to draw some line in an area where it appears that

11

some line must be drawn.

In other words, Indians are no different from

MR. METH:

I think it is reasonably clear from Section 1161 that a

That is correct.

4

state has the, what Mr. Schwartz called the remarkably intrusive

5

authority of telling an Indian reservation that it cannot sell

6

liquor at all.

7

making the entire state dry.

8
9

The way that a state has that authority is by

In 1953, there were two states that were actually dry,
Mississippi and Oklahoma.

The Court on a number of occasions has

10

said that if a governmental entity has a greater power, it also

11

has all of the lesser powers included within that greater power.

12

Two early 21st Amendment cases, Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves

13

and State Board of Equalization v. Young's Market Co. cited in

14

our briefs indicate that a state has the authority under the 21st

15

Amendment to totally prohibit the introduction of liquor within

16

the state, and if a state has that authority it has the authority

17

to strictly control how liquor is to be distributed within the

18

state.

19

Another case, a recent Indian case, Merrion v. Jicarilla

20

Apache Tribe — and I hope I pronounced it correctly — the Court

21

dealt with the question of whether a tribe could exclude nonmembers!,

22

and the Court said that the power to exclude nonmenbers from the

23

reservation included the power to condition entry onto reservation

24

land, to condition the continued presence on Indian land, and also

25

condition reservation conduct.

If a state has the greater power to totally prohibit

liquor within Indian country, I do not understand why the dis­

In summary, California is only asserting that it has
