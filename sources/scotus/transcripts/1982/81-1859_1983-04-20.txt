ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL A. FICARO, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

Mr. Ficaro, you may

MR. FICARO*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

8

The Fourth Amendment, through the requirement

9

of warrants based upon probable cause, seeks to protect

10

citizens and their effects from governmental intrusions

11

by unreasonable searches and seizures.

12

searches and seizures without warrant offend the limits

13

imposed by the Fourth Amendment.

But not all

We submit that Illinois v. Lafayette is one

14
15

such case that does not offend the limits of the Fourth

16

Amendment.

17

search at the station house of the purse of the

18

Respondent, Ralph Lafayette, after a valid custodial

19

arrest was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.

We urge this Court to find that the delayed

We submit to this Court that this post-arrest

20
21

warrantless search was permissible both as incidental to

22

arrest and as a valid inventory search.
QUESTION*

23

Now, Mr. Ficaro, you did not make

24

that search incident to an arrest argument below, did

25

you?

MB. FICARO;

Yes, Your Honor, that argument

2

was made in the trial court.

3

the Appellate Court opinion, the Appellate Court found

4

that it was waived, the Court went on to discuss the

5

issue citing Ross, Belton, Sanders, Chadwick., Edwards,

6

and then in its conclusion in the holding of the case

7

the Court said that we find that this search is not

8

incidental to arrest and thus violates the Fourth

9

Amendment.

Although in one line of

So under Jenkins v. Georgia, the Appellate

10

Court of Illinois reached and decided the constitutional

11

issue.

12

The fact —

13

QUESTION;

Before it got to the end of its

14

opinion on page 3A of the cert petition it said we find

15

the state has waived this argument for the purposes of

16

appeal by failing to raise it at the suppression

17

hearing.

18

Don’t we have to take that at face value?
MR. FICARO:

There are three ways that this

19

case is before this Court.

20

valid — the inventory search which was not —

21

QUESTION;

One is on the theory of

I understand.

This only goes, as

22

Justice O’Connor’s question, only to the question of

23

search incident to arrest.

24

words you waived that.

25

MR. FICAR0&

On that they say in so many

Although they said that under

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

Jenkins v. Georgia, they reached the issue.

2

question of waiver, whether or not this is an

3

independent and adequate ground — this is not an

4

independent ground, the issue of waiver.

5

courts follow procedural and substantive laws to find

6

under the Fourth Amendment.

7

appellate courts, People v. Renke, the courts of

8

Illinois have said that their interpretation of the

9

Fourth Amendment is coextensive with the scope of the

10

The

The Illinois

In People v. Clark, in

federal interpretation by this Court of the Constitution.
QUESTION*

11

But that has nothing to do with

12

whether an argument might be waived, does it, the fact

13

that the two constitutions might be coterminous?
MR. FICARO*

14

The Illinois courts follow the

15

procedural rules, so this Court under the holdings of

16

Steagald which establishes the standard for waiver in

17

Illinois — the Illinois courts in People v. Keller

18

which explicitly says we follow the federal guideline of

19

Steagald for the waiver principles, thereby allows this

20

Court to reach the question of whether or not it was

21

waived.

22

case, the issue was not waived although the Appellate

23

Court in one simple sentence said it was waived.

24
25

By a clear examination of the record in this

QUESTION*

But assuming we ought to take the

word of the Illinois Appellate Court in this particular

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

case on these particular facts as to whether something

2

was waived under Illinois law, shouldn’t we?

3

MR. FICARO;

I believe. Your Honor, it is not

4

an independent ground because they use the federal

5

standard of waiver in Steagald, and, therefore, in

6

applying the federal standard in Steagald this issue was

7

not waived because it was raised in a timely fashion.

8

10

QUESTIONj

Hithout getting into all this

Steagald underbrush, didn’t your Illinois Appellate
Court go on and say and reach the issue anyway —

11

MR. FICARO;

12

QUESTION;

Yes, that is correct.
— by saying that we assume

13

arguendo that it was not waived and then went ahead and

14

decided it.

15

Is that enough for you?

MR. FICARO;

That is enough under Jenkins v.

16

Georgia if they reach the constitutional issue and more

17

significantly —
QUESTION;

18
19

But you have not mentioned it in so

many words.
MR. FICARO;

20

I apologize to the Court.

I

21

thought that was my first reference.

22

said is, in applying the principles of the Supreme Court

23

cases, we find that this was not a search incidental to

24

arrest.

25

But what they have

The facts of this case are that on September 1

a sergeant of the Kankakee City Police was called to a

2

disturbance at a movie theater in Kankakee.

3

arrival he saw the Respondent at the theater having

4

words with the theater manager.

5

theater manager, the manager requested that the sergeant

6

file a complaint against the Respondent, Ralph

7

Lafayette, for disorderly conduct.

Sergeant Mitzner tried to straighten out the
matter there, in his own words, but the Respondent

10

continued yelling and screaming and Sergeant Mitzner

11

then placed him under arrest, did not search him at that

12

time, handcuffed him, took him to his car, and brought

13

him to the police station.

14

Respondent was unhandcuffed and taken into the booking

15

room where the standard police booking procedure began.

16

At the police station the

The Respondent was told to remove his

17

clothing, to put on jail garb, to take the things out of

18

his pockets, and he began filling out forms.

19

according to Sergeant Mitzner, the Petitioner or the

20

Respondent placed his purse on the counter before him,

21

took out a pack of cigarettes.

22

that purse, felt something inside and reached in.

23

Then,

According to the Petitioner, the purse was

24

taken from his shoulder and searched.

But it was

25

uncontested that inside that purse at the time -- after

A motion to supress was heard, was taken under

3

advisement by the trial court.

4

taken under advisement, the state filed a brief in

5

opposition to the motion to suppress.

6

Court then affirmed the holding of the trial court

7

suppressing the evidence.

8

Supreme Court of Illinois was denied, and this matter is

9

before the Court on a writ of certiorari.

Twenty days after being

The reasonableness of a post-arrest

11

warrantless search of the Respondent's purse is

12

predicated upon the right of the state to search the

13

Respondent after his valid custodial arrest for

14

disorderly conduct.

15

authority to search this individual after the arrest has

16

remained virtually unchallenged in this Court.

17

Court noted in Robinson, the right to search is not to

18

be doubted.

19

The validity of Sergeant Mitzner's

As this

The arrest is a reasonable intrusion as this

20

Court has said in the initial stage of prosecution which

21

may lead to the ultimate relinquishment of liberty of

Respondent's disorderly conduct and arrested him for

24

25

contents of his purse became subordinated to the

When Sergeant Mitzner observed the

8

ALDERSON REFORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

legitimate and overriding interests of the state to

2

search that purse.

3

Those interests, as stated in this Court, that

4

are monitored by police officers each day are the

5

interests to disarm the person arrested, to protect the

6

police officers and those around them, to remove the

7

means of escape from the arrested person, and to prevent

8

destruction of evidence that can be used against the

9

person arrested.

Now these interests that were

10

monitored by Sergeant Mitzner were not tailored

11

specifically for Ralph Lafayette.

12

interests served in every arrest and search incidental

13

thereto.

These are the

The interests served are not the justification

14
15

for the search of Ralph Lafayette.

The valid custodial

16

arrest as this Court has indicated is the justification

17

for that search, and the search needs no further

18

justification.
The breadth of authority to search is not

19
20

limited, as this Court has held, by the crime arrested

21

for.

22

police officer arrests an individual for, an officer

23

never knows if he is facing the infamous, as this Court

24

put it, trojan horse.

Despite the trivial nature of a crime that a

1

warrantless search that there may be an absence of the

2

fruits of the crime arrested for or no evidence of the

3

crime that can be seized in relation to the crime,

4

although in this case the bizarre behavior of the

5

Respondent could have been found in the evidence of

6

amphetamines found in his purse.

7

search is not based upon the probability of finding

8

weapons and evidence and means of escape in each and

9

every case, but is based upon the valid custodial arrest.

The justification to

10

The state’s interests to be protected after a

11

valid custodial arrest are constant whether or not in a

12

hindsight glance we can say that the interests were

13

unlikely to have been served in that particular search

14

incidental to arrest.

17

QUESTIONS

What was this man custodial

arrested for?
MR. FICAROs

He was arrested for, Your Honor,

18

disorderly conduct which was a city ordinance which was

19

subject to incarceration.

20
21
22
23

QUESTIONS

And what evidence could you find of

disorderly conduct by searching him?

issue. Your Honor.

I do not believe that is an

However in this case —

QUESTIONS

25

MR. FICAROs

But it is a question -Yes, it is.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. FICARO:

— which I am asking.
And the answer to that question

3

is that the evidence of his bizarre behavior may have

4

resulted from the use of narcotics, in this case

5

amphetamines.

6

establishai evidence of his bizarre behavior, that his

7

yelling and screaming in a public place and acting as

8

what is described as disorderly in this specific case.

9

So in this particular case there could be

It was conceded by the Respondent if Sergeant

10

Mitzner arrested him at the movie station, he could have

11

conducted a search contemporaneous with that arrest, but

12

because the search was at the station, the Respondent

13

says it violated the Fourth Amendment.

14

ruled in United States v. Abel that a valid custodial

15

arrest can justify a search in a place other than the

16

place of arrest, and the Court has allowed a delay of

17

ten hours in a search after a valid custodial arrest, in

18

Edwards.

The Court has

The delayed station house search in this case

does not change the fact that the arrest justifies the

search.

22

manner greater than it would have imposed upon him at

23

the time of his arrest at the movie house.

24

enlarge the scope of permissible search of Ralph

25

Lafayette.

It does not impose on Ralph Lafayette in any

QUESTION*

Hay I ask you one question about

2

the scope of the permissible search?

3

purse that this man was carrying contained a lot of

4

letters in envelopes, some of which were sealed and some

5

were not.

6

Supposing that the

Could the police open and read the mail?
HR. FICARO*

I believe the answer to that

7

question is if it is pursuant to a valid custodial

8

arrest, the police have a right to examine the contents,

9

not to read the contents of the letters, as this Court

10

has indicated in other decisions, that there is a

11

certain amount of scrutiny available to the police.

12

What is reasonable and what may shock the conscience by

13

a broaching —
QUESTION*

14
15

Suppose the envelopes were sealed,

could they rip open the seals and look inside?
MR. FICARO*

16

I believe they could, Your Honor,

17

and it is the arrest that justifies this intrusion

18

because the expectation of privacy of an arrested

19

individual is diminished and the contents of his

20

personal belongings are also diminished.
QUESTION*

21

22
23
24
25

Do we have to go that far in this

case?
MR. FICARO*

No, Your Honor, we do not have to

go that far in this case.
QUESTION*

What if in feeling the envelopes

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

they felt some kind of a granulated powder inside

2

might be sugar, and it might be salt, and it might be

3

narcotics.

Would they be able to open that one?
MS. FICAR04

4

It

I believe they would, Your Honor,

5

in this case under these facts because the valid

6

custodial arrest, just like searching into the pocket of

7

Robinson to find a cigarette pack and then opening a

8

cigarette pack to find narcotics inside would be the

9

same as the Court's example or hypothetical to me.

10

Allowing searches incidental to arrest at a

11

place other than and a time other than the arrest has

12

been recognized by this Court based upon the practical

13

considerations that a police officer has to face every

14

day.

15

2UESTI0N:

16

principle submission?

17

MR. FICAROs

18
19

Is incident to arrest your

No, Your Honor, that is the first

submission.
The reasonableness of what a police officer

20

does in light of the facts and circumstances of each

21

case is the basis of this practical consideration the

22

Court has in allowing a search at a place other than and

23

at a time other than arrest.

24

warrantless searches reasonable that took place seconds

25

after the arrest as in Lavinson and Gustafson, minutes

The Court has found

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

later as in Belton, or hours later in Edwards.

2

these searches incidental to arrest share in common with

3

the search of Ralph Lafayette is the reasonableness

4

under all the circumstances of the time and place of the

5

search.

6

What

Looking through this — looking at this search

7

rather through the eyes of Sergeant Hitzner, it would

8

have been unreasonable and impractical for him to

9

conduct a search in a movie theater lobby where he had

10

been called to quell the disturbance, where a

11

disturbance was taking place, where the defendant may

12

have other friends or associates among the patrons of

13

the theater.

14

recognized this unreasonableness in demanding that the

15

search incidental to arrest be at the time and place of

16

the search incident.

17

It was unreasonable, and the Court has

Wow the Respondent also concedes that the

18

arrest in this case was valid.

19

reasoned in Robinson that a search into a pocket to get

20

a pack of cigarettes and then searching the cigarette

21

pack to get a container crushed around narcotics is

22

reasonable.

23

Now the Court has

Then in this case the search into a purse

24

after a valid custodial arrest to take out a cellophane

25

with narcotics in it is also reasonable.

Both the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

pocket and the purse are repositories of personal

2

effects.

3

indicated in Ross, between worthy and unworthy

4

containers in relation to the unreasonableness of a

5

search and seizure in the protections of the Fourth

6

Amendment.

7

When Sergeant Mitzner placed the Respondent

8

under arrest in that lobby, the Respondent had a

9

diminished expectation of privacy in the contents of his

10

purse because —

11

QUESTION*

12

MR. FICAROs

13

QUESTION:

14

16

No, Your Honor.
—

MR. FICAROs

diminished expectation of

Everything on his person and

within the scope of allowable search, under Chimel.

17
18

Is it limited to the purse or —

privacy of everything on his person?

15

QUESTION:

How about a separate locked trunk

as in Chadwicks
MR. FICAROs

19

It depends upon the association

20

of that locked trunk with the person at the time of his

21

arrest.

22

case —

23
S

There can be no distinction, as this Court has

24
25

But we do not have to reach that issue in this

QUESTION:

You mean if it were nearby it could

be opened and searched?
MR. FICAROs

If it were in the permissible

s

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

scope of Chimel if Chirael is — if the language of

2

Chimel means a foot locker.

3

QUESTIONt

4

HR. FICAROi

If that is what the

5

interpretation of Chimel means, even if it is locked.

6

Under the valid custodial arrest theory, there is really

7

no distinction between going into someone's pocket and a

8

foot locker that they are carrying down the street.

9
10
11

But in Chadwick that issue was not addressed
because it was not a search incidental to arrest.
QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that — in

12

Chadwick didn't the encounter begin when they were

13

standing in the depot or the station?

14

MR. FICAROi

The encounter began in an

15

observation in another city, I believe, but the arrest

16

took place -- there was probable cause to search —

17
18
19

QUESTION:

From where?

Where was there

probable cause?
MR. FICAROi

Based upon observations by agents

20

in, I believe, San Diego following it through to Boston

21

where the foot locker was observed.

22

verify the presence of narcotics --

23
S

Even if it is locked?

QUESTION:

A dog was used to

As soon as the dog sniffed the foot

locker, where were the people when the dog sniffed the

25

foot locker?

SB. FICARO»

That was unclear, Your Honor, but

that issue —

3

QUESTION»

4

MR. FICAR0»

5

QUESTION»

They were close by, weren't they?
That issue was not addressed.
Do you think they could have --

6

suppose the dog had sniffed the foot locker when they

7

were sitting on the foot locker and they arrested them

8

right then.

9

Could you have searched the foot locker?

MR. FICARO»

I believe within the holding of

10

Chimel that foot locker could have been searched as

11

valid, incident to a custodial arrest.

12

The question is whether or not this Court in

13

their language of Chadwick meant closely associated with

14

the person to be a foot locker, but certainly under this

15

situation a purse is an item both closely associated

16

with the person as well as within the scope of Chimel.

17

QUESTION:

In Chadwick the police did not know

18

of any — of the connection between Chadwick and the

19

foot locker until he exercised dominion over it —-

20

MR. FICARO:

21

QUESTION:

That is correct.
— by taking possession, and the

22

police deferred their arrest until he claimed the

23

container that the dog had indicated had drugs in it.

24
25

MR. FICARO»

But I believe this Court has

distinguised Chadwick in that it was not a search

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

incidental to arrest
QUESTION;

And it was not an automobile search.

MR. FICARO:

That is correct.

So then based

upon the necessity for probable cause under the facts
and circumstances of Chadwick, the Court's holding in
relation to the search of that item was correct.
QUESTION;

Did the Ross case possibly have

some impact on Chadwick?
MR. FICARO;

I believe Ross merely indicated

the worthiness and unworthiness of containers for the
purposes of describing, as I have, a purse or a double
locked foot locker.

It is the nature of the container

— it is not the nature of the container that retains
the expectation of privacy in the container.

It is what

is done with that container, it is our position, that
reduces the expectation of privacy.
QUESTION;

Are you going to come to your

theory on the inventory search —
MR. FICARO;
QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
—or have you said all you were

going to say about that?
MR. FICARO;

No, Your Honor, I will.

The search of the Respondent's purse at the
station house after his valid arrest was a post-arrest
warrantless search of property under his control and

18

that were used by the Kankakee Police Department?

MR. FICAR0;

We do not know from the record.

Your Honor, other than the facts of removing the

QUESTION!

What is in the course of the

inventory process?

7

MR. FICAROs

The inventory process. Your

8

Honor, Mr. Justice, is a caretaking administrative

9

practice.

It is not based upon the probable cause, but

10

it is based upon serving the legitimate interests of the

11

state as well as an arrestee.

12

The interests served are those listed in

13

Opperman, to protect the valuables of the arrestee from

14

theft, loss or damage, to protect also the police

15

officer from any harm due to the contents of that

16

property sei2ed.

18

are talking about is the objective harm that may occur

19

if that item and the contents are not inventoried.

20

We are not talking about the
What we

The interests served by inventory include

21

protecting against false claims that the property of the

22

arrestee was either stolen, damaged, or lost by the

23

police, and this cannot be underestimated, the problem

24

this causes both in morale and in the drain of resources

25

in responding to frivolous claims by persons arrested.

served by the inventory search of an arrestee is to

secure the security of the jail cell or the jail house.

MR. FICARO:

indicate that the contents are the following?
QUESTION

If this is your regular form, they

do not.
MR. FICARO*

But they do, which is the basic

consideration, inventory each and every item taken from
the arrestee at the time of his arrest.
QUESTION*

Including the pouch but not the

contents of the pouch, which would seem to suggest you
do not have to look inside the pouch to comply with your
inventory regulations.
MR. FICARO*

I believe you would have to look

into the pouch or you cannot list each and every item
taken from the arrestee at the time of his arrest.

In

weighing the state’s interests in the Respondent’s
expectation of privacy in the contents of his purse,
there is no doubt that the Respondent who is a pre-trial
detainee has a lesser expectation of privacy that
justifies the overriding state interests to search and
inventory the contents of that purse.
I would seek leave of this Court to retain the
remaining portion of my argument for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER A. CARUSONA, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. CARUSONA;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

The Petitioner, the State of Illinois, asks

7

this honorable Court to reverse the decision on two

8

grounds.

9

10

It alleges two grounds, that it is a valid

search incident to the arrest.

11

It is our position as developed in part two of

12

our brief that the question of whether the search can be

13

justified as one incident to the arrest is not properly

14

before this Court since the•Appellate Court held that

15

that issue was waived.

16

held that it was waived, as the state concedes in both

17

its petition for certiorari and its brief, and then went

18

on to note and discuss the issue, that is purely a

19

hypothetical discussion prefaced with the phrase,

20

assuming arguendo, that the state had not waived the

21

issue.

I might add, however, that such

a search might be illegal under Illinois law because it

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 620-9300

1

is controlled by state statute.

2

With respect to this inventory question, the

3

state asked the Court to fashion a rule which requires

4

the police, just as the Kankakee Police Department

5

policy, to open up every container, every repository of

6

personal effects, and this would have to include an

7

envelope because you would have to open up an envelope

8

to check to see whether or not there was currency in it

9

or some type of bearer bond.
Our position, on the other hand, is that this

10
11

Court should approve or affirm the decision in this case

12

and approve the majority rule and that is that the

13

contents of these containers should not be searched as

14

part of an inventory.

15

QUESTIONS

Now, you have said, if I understood

16

you correctly, that the police would not even have been

17

able to obtain a search warrant for that bag that he was

18

carrying.

19

MR. CARUSONAs

20

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

What if, in fact, there was $20,000

21

worth of raw heroin in it and the police do not know

22

that when they arrest him but his conduct was such that

23

they might reasonably think he was influenced by drugs.

24

Are you telling us that under Illinois law there was no

25

way that the police could ever search that shoulder bag

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) S28-S300

1

to see, either to inventory it or for any other purpose?

2

MB. CARUSONA*

What we are saying, Your Honor,

3

is that such a search would not be an inventory search.

4

That would be a criminal search, and it would have to go

5

by the Court's normal standard and perhaps the warrant

6

would apply as in Chadwick.
QUESTION*

7

Suppose — you are suggesting that

8

they should have put it in a sealed wrapper and put it

away and not looked inside of it.

11

12

That is part of your

As far as the inventory issue

is concerned.
QUESTION*

13

Now suppose after he posted his

14

bond and had been fined he then claimed that he had had

15

$10,000 in currency in it but that the $10,000 in

16

currency was missing.

17

not have the right to protect themselves from such a

18

claim?

19

Are you suggesting the police did

MR. CARUSONA*

What we are suggesting, Your

20

Honor, is the right — the police do have a right to

21

protect themselves from a claim, and they could have

22

done it exactly as the officer testified in this case by

23

placing the shoulder bag in an inventory bag, which were

24

available, and securing it in a locker.

25

QUESTION*

Would that prevent this gentleman

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

from claiming afterward that he had $10,000 when he put

it in, that the $10,000 was missing when he was released?

Your Honor, absolutely no

procedure would prevent that from happening.
QUESTIONS

5

out on the table and counting the money would protect

them, would it not?
MR. CARUSONAs

9

That would not protect a false

10

claim.

11

the money was taken when it was handled.

12

I mean, a claim could be made at that time that

QUESTIONS

Even if the person arrested had to

13

sign the form and say I acknowledge this is what I had

14

and here it is and you have listed it on the inventory

15

and yes that is right?

16

MR. CARUSONAs

Well, Your Honor, in this case

17

the shoulder bag could have been placed in an inventory

18

bag and that could have been sealed and the Defendant

19

could have initialed that and then --

20
21

22

QUESTIONS

Yes, but that does not do away with

the type of claim the Chief Justice was inquiring about.
MR. CARUSONAs

I understand.

Perhaps Your

23

Honors may even feel that it is slightly better to

24

search every thing, but that slight interest cannot

25

outweigh the privacy that we are talking about here,

QUESTION*

Well, it is not the function of

are doing is the procedure they are following, a

HR. CARUSONA:

I agree with Your Honor.

In a

QUESTION:

Well, in Opperman we said that an

16

inventory search is a constitutional means for several

purposes, one of which is the protection of the police

18

from false claims, but that is only one of the purposes.

19

MR. CARUSONA:

That is correct. Your Honor,

20

and we feel that that interest is served exactly as the

21

majority of courts have been holding.

22

served by simply putting it in a bag and initialing it.

23

It is better

They find that — Actually the courts are

saying that claims are more likely when the contents are

handled, and, in fact, in regard to whether that is a

significant risk in this case.

3

federal cases in their reply brief, but none of those

involve property taken from someone's cell, not property

The state has cited some

than another?
MH. CARUSONA;

Certainly not. Your Honor.

We

17

are not asking this Court to do that.

What we are

asking in this case is to apply the balancing test of

There is some language in

wrote in Sanders is what we are talking about here and

15

that is that items carried on, accompanied or being

search of those items cannot be justified by any reduced

In Washington just recently a young

man was arrested and he had a package and it was

discovered that there were two venomous, poisonous

8

snakes which had inflicted very serious injury on him

endangering his life.

should not have done a little checking on that, the

contents of that bag?

The whole point is that he might

not have any reason to think there was a bomb or a

22

poisonous snake any more than you would have any reason

23

to think there was $10,000 in the man's wallet, but is

it not the business of the police to find out?

MR. CARUSONA:

That is correct.

I am not sure it is right to call

3

that a hypothetical, that alternative ground, because

4

they were subject to review by the Illinois Supreme

5

Court which might have disagreed with them on waiver so

they had a perfectly good reason for putting another

7

reason in the record if they wanted to avoid review by

8

their superior court.
MR. CARUSONA*

9

I think Your Honor brings up a

10

good point, and that is that in the petition for leave

11

to appeal the state did not raise the waiver question.

12

In fact, they never disputed the waiver contention until

13

the brief that they filed in this Court, and that is

14

something that this Court noted in Tyler was significant.
With respect to this search incident to arrest

15
16

question, it is our position that we must look at what

17

Justice Frankfuter stated in United States v. Rubinowitz

18

and that is that the exception has its basic root on

19

need, and there was no need to conduct a search in this

20

case.

21

Robinson, but once the item, the container, is secured

22

at the station, is in custody of the police that there

23

is no need then to conduct a search for that reason.

24

And if we just facially look at this case compared with

25

Chadwick and Sanders, this is a stronger case.

That need exists at the time of arrest as in

There is

(Laughter)
MR. FICAROs

If we take counsel's less

11

intrusive means test, we do not balance the state’s

12

interests because we are dealing with a pre-trial

13

detainee whose expectation of privacy in the contents of

14

his purse or wallet have been severely restricted.

15

we must balance the state’s interest to search as

16

provided for in the interest named in Opperman versus

17

the rights of a pre-trial detainee.

18

So

And finally as this Court has questioned the

19

waiver issue by the state, the importance in my

20

statement of facts and the relation to a brief being

21

filed after the court took this matter under advisement

22

in the trial court was that the state raised this issue

of search incident to arrest eight days before the court

raised in the trial court below.
