CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

3 next in EEOC against Wyoming.

We will hear arguments
General, I think you may

4 proceed whenever you’re ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

6

MR. LEE:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8 the Court:

The Age Discrimination in Employment Act

9
10

prohibits the federal government, with some exceptions,

11

from employment discrimination based on age, regardless

12 of

the employee’s age; and prohibits other employers

13 engaged in interstate commerce from such discrimination
14 against employees between the ages of 40 and 70.
At issue in this case is the constitutionality

15

16 of that provision of the 1974 amendment to that Act,
17 which extended provisions to state and local government
18 employees.
Bill Crump, who was employed as a district game

19

20 supervisor by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department was
21

forced to retire at age 55, pursuant to a Wyoming

22 statute which, with some exceptions, requires the

23 retirement of all Game and Fish Department employees at
24 age 55.
25

Mr. Crump filed a charge of unlawful age

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S W . WASHINGTON D C. 2nn24 f2D2) 554-2345

1 discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity
2 Commission, which in turn filed this action in the
3 United States District Court for the District of Wyoming

^

4 seeking declaratory relief, back pay and liquidated
5 damages for persons adversely affected by the state's
6 retirement policy.
7

The district court granted the state's motion

8 to dismiss on 10th Amendment, National League of Cities
9 and Towns versus Usery grounds:

Because the case comes

10 to this Court in the posture of a granted motion to
11 dismiss, there is no evidence in this record that either
12 Bill Crump individually or Wyoming game wardens 55 years

f

13

old as a group are, in fact, less fit to perform their

14 duties because of the fact that they have turned 55.
15

QUESTION:

Do you recall, Hr. Solicitor

16 General, whether in Murgia there was any subjective
17 evidence with respect to capacity to perform the job?

MR. LEEi

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LEEi

I believe there was.
In relation to the particular -To Mr. Murgia.
— or men under a particular age?
The evidence in that case, as I

23 recall, was that there was a general deterioration of
24 certain physical abilities that were related to capacity
25 to perform as members of the uniformed police force.

1

And the evidence similarly was that as to Mr. Murgia,

2 whatever his name was, that it had not happened in his

3 case .
4

Congress’s congressional authority to extend

5 the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to state and
6

local governments can be found in either of two separate

7 sources; the Commarce clause and Section V of the 14th
8

9

Amendment.

I will discuss each of them separately.

With regard to the Commerce clause, the issue

10

is whether the state of Wyoming has satisfied each of

11

the three hurdles plus the balancing test specified by

12

this Court in National League of Cities and Towns versus

13 Usery and Hodel versus Virginia Surface Mining.
14

It is common ground that the ADEA regulates the

15 states as states.

Rut beyond that, Wyoming has not made

16 its case and cannot.

The reasons, which are spelled out

17 in more detail, can be best summarized and put in most
18 helpful perspective by examining just what it is that
19 Wyoming seeks to do with its mandatory retirement
20

program, and the impact of Congress’s statute on the

21

achievement of that objective.

22

The state itself has identified its goal.

23 is, and I’m quoting from the state’s brief,

It

"To assure

24 the physical preparedness of Wyoming game wardens to
25 perform their duties."

The only effect of the

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

congressional requirement on that concededly proper

2 state goal is to require a tighter fit between the goal
3
4

and the means for achieving it.
There are two basic approaches to the problem

5

of eliminating from the work force those whose age

6

impedes effective performance.

7

presumptive group approach, in which all members of the

8

class are automatically swept out, notwithstanding the

9

fact that everyone recognizes, as was true in Murgia,

The first is a

10

that some members of that group are under no age

11

disability.

12

The advantage of this concededly over-inclusive

13

approach is that it's easier to administer, and the

14

court held in Murgia that it satisfies the rational

15

basis test.

16

The other approach is to determine on an

17

individual basis those particular persons who are and

18

those who are not less able to perform because of age.

19

The starting point for analysis is that

20

Congress has not prohibited the group approach.

21

ADEA permits the mandatory retirement of groups as

The

22 groups, rather than individuals as individuals, which of
23

course is always available to the state, so long as the

24

state can show that in fact, age is a bona fide

25

occupational qualification for the group to which the

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1 dragnet is to be applied.
2
w

The key element in proving a bona fide

3 occupational qualification, according to the test that
4 has been approved by almost all of the federal courts
5 that have faced the issue, is proof that all or
6 substantially all persons beyond the designated age are
7 unable to perform the job safely and effectively.
8

Now, the sensible premise of this requirement

9 is that if all or almost all the members of the group
10 share the disability, then the group approach is
11 appropriate to identify the disability.

Age is then a

12 proxy for disability, because by hypothesis, it is
shared by virtually all of the members of the group.

i
14

Therefore, under the ADEA, the state's very

15 proper goal of weeding out the age-impaired from its
16 work force can be achieved by either of two means.

One,

17 a mandatory retirement program applicable to all members
18 of the group if the state can show that, in fact, as to
19 that group, the approach does identify the age-impaired
20 with sufficient precision as to all members of the group
21

QUESTION:

General Lee, the Congress of the

22 United States itself has imposed a mandatory retirement
*
V

23

age for similarly situated federal prsonnel, as I

24 understand it.
25

MR. LEE:

Yes.

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Maybe that indicates to us that

2 there is a BFOQ defense for the state as a matter of law.
3

ME. LEE;

I don't think, so, Justice O'Connor.

4

It is true that Congress, in its 1978 amendment, did

5

consider the possibility of these little enclaves of

6

federal employees whom it was leaving, who were still

7

subject to mandatory requirements.

8

proposal at that time to eliminate all of those.

9

And there was a

It is fairly apparent from the legislative

10

history, as is spelled out from our brief statements by

11

Representative Spellman and Representative Hawkins.

12

reason that that was not done is that some of these

13

enclaves applying to such people as CIA, air traffic

14

controllers, law enforcement and fire fighters and some

15

others, ware subject to the jurisdiction, the primary

16

jurisdiction of other committees and they did not want

17

to trounce on their turf before giving them an

18

opportunity to pass on that issue.

19

The

But insofar as the constitutional significance

20 is concerned, here I submit is the only significance of
21

the fact that Congress has not extended this rule yet to

22 all federal employees.
23
24
25

QUESTION;

Do you recall the case involving the

foreign service officers?
MR. LEE;

Vance versus Bradley, yes.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE . S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

2

QUESTION;

There certainly there was a policy

decision by the Congress of the United States that there

3 was an inherent impediment on foreign service officers
4 after reaching the age of 60.
5

HE. LEE;

6

QUESTION;

That is correct.
Doesn't that relate to the question

7 Justice O'Connor put to you?
8

MR. LEE;

It certainly does.

And what that

9 shows is that either Congress or any other legislative
10

policy-making body, incluging the state of Wyoming or

11

including the state of Massachusetts, may conclude by

12 legislative action

that mandatory retirement programs

13 are constitutional, or at least that they are required
14 in the interest of the achievement of some state
15 objective.

And if that's all you have, then it passes

16 constitutional muster.

That's Vance versus Bradley, and

17 that's Murgia versus -- that's Massachusetts Board of
18 Retirement versus Hurgia.
19

What you have in this case applicable to

20 Wyoming is an additional element, and that
21

is a

supervening legislative judgment that in certain kinds

22 of contexts the line should be drawn with greater

23 precision, and for reasons that I will discuss. Congress
24 also has the right to make that decision.
25

The only argument that can be made against it

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is that Congress has been under-inclusive, and

2

particularly with respect to Congress’s both Commerce

3 clause judgments and also 14th Amendment judgments.

The

4 under-inclusive argument simply has not met with much
5 success.
6

The most that you can say is that Congress has

7 been somewhat inconsistent, or at least that it has not
8

yet taken the ultimate step that complete consistency

9 might indicate it should.

But that is not sufficient

10 basis to render it unconstitutional.
11

QUESTION:

12 game warden

Kow would compare the functions of a

with the functions of the officer involved

13 in the Kurgia and, I think, Feeney cases?
14

QUESTION:

15

KR. LEE:

Or with an FBI agent?
Or with an FEI agent.

This -- I

16 think it would be difficult to imagine a case in which
17 the case for mandatory retirement is less strong than it
18 is in the case of Bill Crump, because he was not just a
19 game warden; he was a game warden supervisor, which was
20 basically a
21

supervisory kind of responsibility.

And for

that reason, I think that it does not rise to the same

22 level as the foreign service employees in Vance, or the

23 uniformed police in Murgia.
24

But that is not the controlling point.

The

25 controlling point is that just as this Court very

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

properly held in Jurgia and Vance versus Bradley, that

2 it does not violate the 14th Amendment for a
3 policy-making body to adopt a mandatory retirement
4 program.

And, just as for reasons that I will discuss,

5 it is also constitutional for Congress, pursuant to its
q

commerce and its 14th Amendment powers, to prescribe

7 that in certain contexts to be identified by Congress
8

more is required than the dragnet approach of the broad,

9

overall inclusive approach is also constitutional.

10
11

The fact that Congress does both at the same
time and that those exist side by side does not affect

12 the constitutionality of either, because the
13

constitutionality of both rests on separate grounds.

14

That is perhaps best illustrated when we turn to the

15 comparison of the state and federal interests, the final
10 inquiry that is specified by Model and Usery.
17

On the state's side, the state's objective in

18

maintaining a physically fit game warden force is left

19

intact by the ADEA.

20 fitness itself must
21

The only requirement is that
be the inquiry, and unlike the Fair

Labor Standards Act, the ADEA does not prescribe to the

22 states any level of expenditures.
23

The countervailing federal interest by contrast

24

is weighty; it is threefold.

The first is prevention of

25

unnecessary unemployment and lack of productive capacity

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in areas of endeavor affecting interstate commerce.

2 Congress had before it evidence which indicated that the

3 magnitude of that loss of productive endeavor throughout
4 the United States was on the order of several billion
5 dollars a year.
The second is the prevention of unnecessary

6

7 demands on the federal Social Security system.

And

8 third and perhaps most important of all was the

9 prevention of arbitrary discrimination.
QUESTION;

10
11

General Lee, supposing we just

confine ourselves for the moment to the first ground,

12 the

interest in the work force, and Congress found that

13 it would be, there’s a shortage of jobs and it would be
14 better to have younger men occupying these positions in
15 the long run and that therefore, they imposed a
16 mandatory retirement age of 55 for nationwide, game
17 wardens, law enforcement people throughout the country.
18 Would that be constitutional?
19
20 under

21

MR. LEE;

I think it would be constitutional

Murgia .
QUESTION;

22 Congress in

Wasn’t that part of the theory in

putting a limit on the foreign service

23 officers so that there would be an inducement for
24 younger people to get in the system and not have these
25 over-aged men of 60 blocking their progress?

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE

S.W

WASHINGTON D C POO94 (202} 554-2345

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. LEE:

That was a much more powerful

3 argument to me a few years ago than it is right now.
QUESTION:

4

General Lee, in amplification of

5 Justice Stevens' question, supposing that Congress
6

imposed a mandatory retirement age of 50, feeling that

7 it really wanted to get the younger people up there, and
8

Wyoming came with a showing that half of its game

9 wardens were over 50, and therefore, it really was
10

impairing its right to structure its own employment

11

system?

12

application of the Fair Labor Standards Act.

That would be a fair amount closer to the

MR. LEE:

13

I think it would be a fair amount

14 closer, yes, because it does -- while Hodel said that
15 economic impact alone is not sufficient, it certainly is
16 relevant.

And at least you would have an economic

17 impact at that point.
I think the point, Justice Stevens, and Chief

18

19 Justice Burger, in answer to both of your questions is
20 this.

21

That these are difficult policy questions.

And

they are questions that can be resolved either by the

22 group approach or by the individual approach,

and they

23 can be resolved either by the policy that says we need
24 to have more young people in the work force, or by
25 saying we need to preserve the productivity of the older

13

and the mors experienced persons.
But Congress can make the judgment either way,

2
3

and similarly, it can make the judgment and say we’re

4

going to take it one step at a time, and we're only

5

going to identify part of the people to whom our policy

6 is going to

extend at a time.

QUESTION:

7

But earlier, you said the case was

8

really one of drawing the line with greater precision.

9

It seems to me the question is, rather. Congress has

10 decided
11
12
13

who shall be drawing the line.

Because they say

the EEOC shall draw the line, not the state of Wyoming.
HR. LEE:

Well, that’s true, that is correct.

But it's consistent with the policy.

14 fleshing in

That is simply

the BFOQ, which in turn was set by Congress.

15

QUESTION:

General Lee, —

16

QUESTION:

Doesn’t this action of Congress in

17

the position you’re taking reject the concept that is

18 associated

with Justice Brandeis that the state should

19 be allowed

to have wide latitude in experimenting with

20 various programs?
21

They might find, for example, that in

Florida after a period of time the game wardens and

22 police officers would last longer than they would in the
23 rigorous climate

of Wyoming.

Isn't that the whole

24 concept of Brandeis?
25

MR. LEE:

That's a good point, Mr. Chief

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

4nn

VIRGINIA AVF

S W

WASHINGTON n O 90094 (OdO\ 554-9345

1

Justice, and it doss very little if any violence at all

2

to that concept which I fully support, for this reason.

3 It permits Florida to reach one judgment and Wyoming to
4 reach another with respect to what is a bona fide
5 occupational qualification.
All that Congress has done is to say that

6

7 you've got to have a more accurate measure for what is
8 the disability than age itself.

That you've got to act

9 on something that's more solidly based than just
10

stereotypes and hunches.
QUESTIONi

11
12 a

From your description. Congress was

good deal more stringent than that, if the principle

13 of the BFOC is that all or substantially all have to be
14 disabled from performing.

That's a very difficult

15 requirement for any state to show.

So it seems to me

16 that Congress has virtually outlawed any sort of a
17 mandatory retirement age.
Under the ADEA would it be permissible for,

18

19 say, Wyoming or some other state to say we think that we
20 want to take it on
21

a more individualized basis, but we

also think that as you go past 55, you run more of a

22 risk.

So although we require physicals every two years

23 for people under 55, we're going to require physicals
24 every six months for people over 55?

Or would the EEOC

25 say that's age discrimination?

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. LEE;

I don't know what the EEOC would say,

2 but I would say that it’s an acceptable procedure.

3

QUESTION;

Well, that doesn't mean the EEOC

4 wouldn't say it's age discrimination.
5

MR. LEE;

I agree with that.

6

Following up on that point, and the extent to

7 which Congress can make these judgments, Bill Crump is a
8 citizen of Wyoming.

9

QUESTION;

Are you personally acguainted with

10

him that you refer to him by name all the time, or is it

11

just kind of an argument tool?

12

MR. LEE;

Just kind of an argument tool.

13

(Laughter.)

14

Mr. Crump is not only a citizen of Wyoming; he

15 is also a citizen of the United States.

And the United

16 States has a legitimate interest which is rooted in
17 Congress's Section V 14th Amendment power to insure that
18 if he and other like him are to be removed against their
19 will from the work force for which they have been
20 trained, which they know best,
21

at an age in life which

may well represent the point which may be the peak of

22 their professional careers,

then at the very least, the

23 state must show that it is acting on something more
24 solid than just anecdotes and stereotypes.
25

And that brings us to the second source of

15

Ann VIRGINIA A VP

WASHINGTON 0 C Onn

tow

RS4-9S4 s

1

Congress’s authority to pass this statute, which is

2

Section V.
QCIESTIOSs

3

Do you mean by that, Mr. Solicitor

4

General, that Congress was acting on a stereotype with

5

respect to foreign service officers, FBI agents,

6 military people, where they have arbitrary retirement
7 ages,

all of them down the line?

Is that a stereotype

8 or is that a considered judgment in how to manage their
9 responsibilities?
10

MR. LEE;

I don't know.

All I do know is that

11

under this Court's decision in Vance versus Bradley, the

12

court is willing to assume that since that fell within

13 their authority to enact, it was proper for them

tq make

14 that judgment.
15

In South Carolina versus Katzenbach, Congress's

16 prohibition

against the use of literacy tests was

17 upheld, notwithstanding the fact of this Court's earlier
18 holding that literacy tests themselves do not violate the
19 Constitution.

The principle is that while Congress may

20 not define constitutional rights,
21

it can pass

legislation appropriate for the purpose of more

22 effectively enforcing constitutional rights which have
23 been identified by this Court.
24

This case is identical to South Carolina versus

25 Katzenbach in this respect.

Murgia and Vance versus

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Bradley make clear that the equal protection clause

2

protects against age discrimination, and Congress has

3

taken steps to enforce that general guarantee.
QUESTION;

4
5

What statement did Murgia make about

the Constitution protecting against age discrimination?
MR. LEE;

6

It is simply an inference, Justice

7

Rehnquist, from the fact that the court rejected age as

8

a suspect classification, it rejected employment as a

9

fundamental right, and then went on to find that there

10 was

a rational basis, all of which is consistent with if

11

the court had, in fact, held that age is not protected

12

by the equal protection clause, all of that analysis

13

would have been surplusage.

14

necessarily the holding is built on the premise that age

15

is protected by the — or, is included within the 14th

16

Amendment.
QUESTION;

17
18

MR. LEE;

20

QUESTION;

Oh, indeed, I do.
Do esn * t that merely say that

you assume for purp ose sofa dec ision that it 's

22 protected,
23

Do you find that a very satisfying

analysis?

19

21

Therefore, I say that

and then go ahead and make the analys

MR. LEE;

The court did not say in so m

24

words that age — but if there is any doubt on that, --

25

and may I add that the dozen or so lower federal courts

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that have considered the issue, the same premise is

2 built in — I see no reason that age should not be

3 protected.
4

This Court has said that the legal protection

5 clause prohibits all forms of discrimination, and
6

indeed, it should.

And certainly, the argument can be

7 made that there is no crueler form of discrimination
8

than discrimination based on age precisely because —

9 there comes a point at which it is rational as to all
10

people, but because of that fact, it is more easy to

11

QUESTION*

Did I understand you to say, Nr.

NR. LEE*

Well, yes.

Wouldn't that be equally

20 discriminatory?

21

MR. LEE*

No, I think that is squarely covered

22 by — it may be discriminatory in the sense that it

24 statute passed by any legislature is discriminatory, but
25 it passes the rational basis test, and that's Kurgia and

Vance versus Bradley
QJESTION:

2

You were talking about

3 discrimination against the people in this c ase who are
4 compelled to retire at 55.

It would seem t o me that the

5 feieral employees would similarly be discri minated
6

against.
MR. LEE:

7
8

Indeed, that argument :i n be made,

And the answer to it is, as this Court has clarified on

9 many occasions, that the under-inclusivenes s argument
10 simply is a
11

very weak one in the equal prot ection

context, and that Congress can take it one step at a

12 time.

Congress may conclude, either on the one hand

13 that its policies that it wishes to enact a re achieved
14 by mandatory retirement programs, or it can make the
15 opposite conclusion.
16

Now, in this case as to some peopl e it has made

17 one of those conclusions, and as to other p eople it has
18 made others.

But that does not detract fro m the fact

19 that it has the power to io each.
20
21

And the most that can

be said is that it has been under-inclusive

•

There was the proposal that was pu t before

22 Congress in

1978 to do the job completely, to take care

23 of both federal and state all in one fell s woop.
24 Because largely of the overlapping jurisdic tion and the
25 committee problem, Congress elected not to do that at

20

1

that time
But it has the authority to do either, and it

2

3 also follows, in my view, that it has the authority to
4 do both simultaneously, side by side.
QUESTION;

5

6 experimenting on

ME. LEE;

7

Do you suppose Congress was

the states collectively in this area?
Experimenting in the sense - to the

8 extent that it's experimenting, it's doing it both

9 ways.

It imposes on itself, on the federal government,

10

a more stringent requirement insofar as the age

11

limitations are concerned.

The cap is off insofar as

12 federal employees are concerned.

The Act prohibits all

13 age discrimination to the federal government, and to the
14 states, there are no exceptions except the exceptions -15 well, the exceptions as to the state are age exceptions,
16 between the ages of 40 and 70.

Over 70, under 40, the

17 state is subject only to those strictures that are
18 imposed by this Court's decision in the Murgia case.
19

The final issue that I'd like to deal with just

20 briefly is the state's argument,
21

and one that the

district court followed, that the 14th Amendment — that

22 Congress cannot exercise its 14th Amendment power

23 without saying so, and saying so rather explicitly.
24 That, I submit, is an erroneous argument for two reasons.
25

One is that we believe that Congress did intend

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
Ann VIRGINIA AVF

S W

WASHINGTON D O 9nn?A

(OCIO'l

1

to exerciss its 14th Amendment powers.

2

that is shared by the overwhelming majority of lower

3 federal courts.

That is a view

Probably the best observation is in the

4 Seventh Circuit's opinion in Calumet that the dominant
5 feature of the legislative history was a concern that
6 embedded and

inaccurate stereotypes ware producing

7 irrational employment decisions.

That is the language

8 of equal protection for prohibition of discriminatory

9 conduct and not of commerce.
10

But even if we’re wrong on that issue, the

11

premise of the state's argument is itself in error.
The Constitution requires passage by two Houses

12

13 of Congress and signature by the President.

It also

14 reguires that Congress action be authorized by some
15 constitutional provision.

It does not require that

16 Congress identify what that provision is.

That is a

17 judicial function and not a legislative function.
The function of legislative history where it

18

19 exists is to ascertain congressional intent.

22

It is not

Court knows about constitutional law.
The district court has, in effect, held that if

Mr. Salzburg, supposing that Wyoming

had a law that said all game wardens shall be men?

3 Could the federal government prohibit that?
MR. SALZBURG;

4

Your Honor, Wyoming could not

5 have such a law because sex discrimination is
6

unconstitutional in this context.

Understand that in

7 this case, although the Solicitor General chooses to
8 call this arbitrary discrimination, what we have here is

9 clearly not arbitrary discrimination.
10 General

The Solicitor

does not argue -- no one in this case argues —

11

that what Wyoming has done here violates the

12

Constitution.

13

The distinction between what Wyoming has done

14 is that this conduct is constitutionally permissible;
15 whereas, a statute which presumed to discriminate on the
16 basis of sex would clearly be unconstitutional.

Wyoming

17 has no reserved right under the 10th Amendment to
18 violate the Constitution.

Wyoming does have a right

19 that is embodied in the 10th Amendment to make its own
20 fundamental

This is just shearing off a few at the

further end of the age spectrum and saying them you may

5

MR. SALZBURG:

6 intrusive.

Your Honor/ it’s more

The reason is because we would submit it's

7 not merely telling us how much to pay; it's telling us
8 who will deliver the essential governmental services
9 that the state of Wyoming has a right to deliver to its
10 citizens.
11

It is saying you will have police officers who

12 are over a certain age after the state legislature has

13 made a decision that is properly vested in the state

14 legislature under the Constitution that those
15 individuals will not deliver the state police services
16 to the people in the state of Wyoming.

In that regard.

17 this is far more intrusive than the case was in National
18 League of Cities versus Usery.

The integral operations of any state system, of

20 any state function, of any traditional state function,
21 it seems to Wyoming depends integrally on who delivers

decisions, so long as the state is able to show a

2 rational basis for the decision.
3

That ignores what the

BFOQ does.

4

First, the BFOQ turns equal protection analysis

5

— and I speak of equal protection analysis because it*s

6

impossible to talk about reasonable classifications even

7

in the commerce sense without talking about equal

8

protection — the reason that BFOQ does not suffice is

9

twofold.
First, the BFOQ defense forces the state of

10
11

Wyoming to justify its admittedly constitutional conduct

12

to a federal court.

13

that what Wyoming has done by requiring our law

14

enforcement officers to retire is unconstitutional.

15

That is because everyone recognizes that this Court's

16

decision in Mass, versus Murgia would control.

Again, no one in the case suggests

Nonetheless, the Congress, through the

17
18

enactment of the BFOQ defense, is the only method for

19

the state of Wyoming to vindicate its constitutional

20

conduct.

21

unconstitutional burden; unconstitutional in the sense

It forces Wyoming to go into court and bear an

22 that it requires far more for the vindication of its
23
24
25

constitutional conduct than this Court would require.
QUESTION:

Mr. Salzburg, do you think it's open

to us to decide that Wyoming has established a BFOQ

1

defensa as a mattar of law because of the congressional

2

enactment exempting its own law enforcement personnel

3

from application of the Act?
MR. SALZBURG*

4

It is clear from the legislative

5

history, Your Honor, that the Congress treats its own

6

law enforcement officers as being presumptively entitled

7

to a bona fide occupational qualification.

8 therefore,
9

It seems,

to me•to be clear that the court could decide

as a matter of law that Wyoming is entitled to the same

10 BFOQ as a matter of law -11

QUESTION*

12

MR. SALZBURG*

13

It would certainly solve our

problem in this case, Your Honor.
QUESTION*

14
15

Would that solve your problem?

What would be the theory on which we

would reach such a decision?
MR. SALZBURG*

16

The theory is, Your Honor, that

17

there is no constitutionally significant difference in

18

the facts between the federal government's

19

across-the-board requirement for its law enforcement

20 officers — and understand
21

enclaves.

that it's not little

The legislative history which supports the

22 reduction in

1974 of the mandatory retirement age for

23

federal law enforcement officers indicates that they

24

were talking about 41,600 individuals in the federal

25

service.

We're not talking about something that's

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

nominal
The point is that if it is possible to find

3

that law enforcement as a generic term would entitle a

4

state or the federal government to a BFOQ in age

5

discrimination matters, it shouldn’t be any different

6

for the federal government than it is for the states.

7

QUESTION:

Well, certainly we wouldn't do it as

8

a matter of congressional intent, then, because there's

9

no indication that I can find that Congress intended age

10

to be an automatic BFOQ in the case where it was

11

applying the ADEA to states.

12

MR. SALZBURG:

No, Your Honor.

There are many

13

references in the briefs and the legislative history to

14

statements made that the Congress, when it enacted the

15

BFOQ defense, was recognizing that there were certain

16

physically strenuous occupations that the states

17

control, including law enforcement occupations, fire

18

fighter occupations and those sorts of things, which the

19

BFOQ was specifically designed to protect.

20
21

The problem occurs because this Court's test in
terms of the states protecting its constitutional right

22 to make fundamental employment decisions is one of mere
23
24
25

rationality .
The BFOQ, on the other hand, as you recognized
in the Solicitor General's argument, imposes quite a

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

The burden is all or substantially

3

performing the functions, and moreover, that it is

4

impossible or impractical to test individually for the

5

particular factor that you are trying to determine, such

that age is the only reasonable qualifier.

The record, as the Solicitor

General points out, consists only of a complaint.

And

of course, since the complaint was dismissed, the
factual allegations of the complaint are deemed to be
true.

However, that doesn't mean that our record is

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ievoid of evidence about what these people do.

The

2 court can judicially notice the statutes in the state of
3

Wyoming which set certain of the requirements for

4

Wyoming game and fish wardens who are law enforcement

5

officers.

6

They include generally, the enforcement of the

7

game and fish violations.

8

violations, the taking of an elk out of season.

9

not, it seems to me, a very severe leaving of the record

10

to take the next step by implication and understand that

11

those violations do not occur, by and large, on the

12

streets of Cheyenne, Wyoming but rather, occur during

13

hunting season in aeas where hunting occurs.

14

That's poaching, license
It is

So it’s clear enough from this record that the

15

court can determine that the duties that are set by

16

Wyoming statute for these particular law enforcement

17

officers are strenuous indeed.

18

Now, the lower courts have avoided the 10th

19

Amendment constitutional challenge, and found that

20

rather than this statute being an exercise of the 10th

21

Amendment — excuse me, of the commerce power — they

22 have assumed that Congress used its Section V power
23
24
25

under the 14th Amendment.

14 V power exists.

It would be no different in the result.

Clearly not.

Then can’t we assume that they did.

6

MR. SALZBURG;

No, Your Honor, I need to

7

clarify that because my argument has apparently been

8

misapprehended.

9

Dur position is this.

The 14th Amendment

10

enforcement power grants the Congress very broad power

11

to enforce the provisions of the amendment itself.

12

Court has held many times that that power is plenary

13

within the terms of the grant.

14

This

Our position is that ADEA is not appropriate

15

legislation to enforce the 14th Amendment simply because

16

what the state has done here — and I need to limit

17

myself to the application in this case — what the state

18

has done here is not a constitutional violation.

19

Now, the 14th Amendment grants to Congress

20

basically three powers.

Of course, it grants the

21

Congress the ability to prohibit conduct which in and of

22 itself would violate the equal protection clause.
23

Further, it also grants to Congress the ability to pass

24

legislation which remedies the current effects of past

25

constitutional violations.

And finally, it grants to

if the courts are

under the commerce clause, which is otherwise

2 appropriate.

No one said that the Congress could not

3

have enacted federal minimum wage laws under the

4

commerce power because it clearly had that power to

5

regulate interstate commerce in that fashion.

However, when it came to regulating the states,
the 10th Amendment was an affirmative limitation on

MR. SALZBURG:

It's a difficult question to

speculate about, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

At any rate, after the 14th

Amendment they could not.
MR. SALZBURG:

Clearly not.

Because the 10th

Amendment, again, is no bar to congressional action
which prohibits a state constitutional violation.

The

state does not reserve to itself any power to act
unconstitutionally.
Finally, Your Honor, I need to discuss the
problem of the closer fit.

The Solicitor General's

argument is that Congress, notwithstanding this Court’s
ruling in Massachusetts Board of Retirement versus
Murgia, has the power to require a closer fit between

1

the goals which the state may legitimately have, and the

2

means which the state chooses to get there.
As applied in this case, that argument leads to

3
4

the conclusion that the Congress has the power to

5

overrule this Court on questions of constitutional law.

Mr. Solicitor General?

Do you have anything

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.

ON EEHALF OF THE APPELLEES — Rebuttal

17

MR. LEE:

18

Just a couple of matters, Mr. Chief

19 Justice.

First, with regard to Mr. Salzburg's final

20
21

argument, it's exactly the same argument that New York

22 made in Morgan.
23

New York in the Morgan case argued that

its English language requirement could not be prohibited

24 by Congress because
25 it.

the Constitution did not require

And that’s exactly -- and the significance of

has, in effect, concluded that there is a BFOQ for law

13 enforcement, that is not the approach.

Ani indeed, if

14 it were it would excuse privately employed security
15 guards covered by the ADEA.

Rather, Congress's approach

16 has simply been to go not as far as it might.
17

With regard to the states, it has not

18 prohibited age discrimination under age 40 or over age
19 70, and with regard to the federal government, it has

QUESTIONS

Well, there are a number of federal

22 employees who are not subject to as stringent

23 limitations on retirement as the state of Wyoming’s will
24 be, isn’t that true?
25

MR. LEEs

That is correct.

As I say, it is an

under-inclusiveness argument.
Finally, let me take Justice Stevens' question

2

3 one step further.

Congress reenacts and says that it's

4 acting pursuant to the 14th Amendment.

The same result

5 obtains, I submit, if Congress reenacts ani says
6

absolutely nothing.

There is no constitutional

7 requirement that Congress either provide legislative
8 history or specify the constitutional basis for what it

9 has done.

10 there is a constitutional basis,
11

that constitutional basis.

is what it was doing or not is for

13 this Court to determine.

For this reason, the judgment of the District
