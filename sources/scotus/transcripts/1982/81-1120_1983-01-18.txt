ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. WALLACE*

6

7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court s
This case is here on the Government's petition

8

9

Mr. Wallace, I think

from the Court of Appeals* reversal of a judgment

10

holding the respondent in civil contempt for

11

noncompliance with an order enforcing Internal Revenue

12

summonses.

13

raised in the Government's petition was denied by this

14

Court.

15

A motion to expand the issues beyond these

Briefly, what occurred here was a summons was

16

issued as part of an investigation of respondent’s tax

17

liabilities for the years 1973 through '77.

18

called upon him as president of two real estate

19

corporations to produce the books and records of those

20

corporations, as well as to testify.

21

comply, the usual petition for enforcement of the

22

summons was filed within a — a supporting affidavit by

23

the Internal Revenue agent, and a show cause order was

24

issued for the summons enforcement proceeding.

25

The summons

When he failed to

There were some evasions of efforts to serve

1

the order.

These are for the most part more relative to

2

the criminal contempt proceeding rather than the civil

3

contempt proceeding now before the Court, although they

4

could hava a bearing on the respondent’s credibility

5

when he did appear.
Eventually he was served and directed to

6
7

appear at an enforcement hearing held about one year

8

after the summons had been issued, and he was also asked

9

to respond, to put into issue any issues that might be

10

controverted.

He neither appeared nor filed a response,

11

nor did anyone else appear on behalf of the corporation,

12

although he did prior to the hearing send a letter to

13

the Deputy United States Marshall and to the Court in

14

which he claimed he was not the president of the

15

corporations and had been improperly served.
Because the Government therefore anticipated

16
17

that he might put that issue into contest into the

18

summons enforcement proceeding, it did come prepared to

19

make proof that the corporations had been duly chartered

20

with him as a director and had not been dissolved and

21

that he had acted in banking and business transactions

22

on behalf of the corporations.
This offer of proof was made in his absence,

23
24

and an enforcement order was issued, and he was ordered

25

to comply.

And when he failed to produce the records
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

upon meeting with the agent in pursuit of that, and

2

after other difficulties in serving him again,

3

eventually a show cause order for the contempt

4

proceeding was served upon him after his arrest pursuant

5

to a bench warrant; and the hearing was held some months

6

later with the respondent in attendance.

7

And at that time he again did not testify or

8

present any evidence, was -- the Government attempted to

9

further bolster its case with some additional evidence,

10

but that proved to be unsuccessful because the witnesses

11

in one case pleaded the Fifth Amendment, in the other

12

case had nothing of value to state.

13

Court held the respondent in contempt and then gave him

14

an opportunity to purge himself, whereupon he offered a

15

written statement entitled "Oath in Purgation of

16

Contempt," but refused to testify or to be cross

17

examined on the statement and did not produce any other

18

evidence in response to the order.

19

Court found that he as president of the corporations had

20

possession or control of the records and had not

21

satisfied his burden to show that he could not comply

22

with the summonses and failed to produce any evidence of

23

the contempt proceeding.

And the District

And the District

24

Sow, while our position gained some strength

25

from the belated nature of the respondent’s submission

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of this oath in purgation, as I will explain for

2

purposes of the civil contempt, our basic position would

3

be the same if he had made precisely the same submission

4

at the outset of the summons enforcement hearing.
This Court has considered the showing that the

5
6

Government is required to make in an Internal Revenue

7

summons enforcement proceeding on a number of

8

occasions.

9

of course cited in the briefs.

The basic case. United States v. Powell, is
And if those cases mean

10

anything they mean that when the Government made that

11

showing, it is entitled to have its summons enforced

12

unless -- and the question in this case is what does

13

that "unless" mean in the context of a summons seeking

14

production of corporate records from an officer who

15

would ordinarily be their custodian, have either

16

possession or control over them.

17

And in answering the question of what the

18

"unless" means, we look to, and we think it's proper for

19

the Court to look to, cases involving not only Internal

20

Revenue summons but other forms of legal process such as

21

grand jury subpoenas, congressional subpoenas,

22

proceedings to direct a bankrupt to turn over his

23

records to a trustee, et cetera.

24
25

Because the issue is basically the same, and
the principle that we draw from the case law is that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

when the Government has made its requisite showing, it

2

has established a prima facie case that it's entitled to

3

enforcement, that the order should be complied with, and

4

that a burden of production then shifts to the

5

respondent to introduce some evidence of why he should

6

not comply.

7

but a burden of production shifts at that point because

8

the Government is not required to anticipate and negate

9

every possible defense.

10

The burden of persuasion does not shift,

This is — this principle is explained perhaps

11

most explicitly in an excerpt that we reproduce on page

12

24 of our brief from this Court's opinion in United

13

States v. Fleischman, which happened to be a criminal

14

contempt proceeding involving a congressional subpoena.

15

But it explains that the rule being adopted is a rule

16

affecting merely the time and manner of proof rather

17

than a shift of the burden of persuasion, but it

18

explains that the prosecution would be under a serious

19

practical handicap if it must negate all possible

20

defenses, and that the — the relevant facts are

21

peculiarly within the respondent's knowledge of why,

22

contrary to what one would normally think of the

23

president of a corporation, he is not in a position to

24

comply with the subpoena.

25

There is sort of a presumption of business

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

regularity, that the person normally thought to be in

2

possession or control of a business* records would be

3

the person to seek, them from.

4

jury subpoenas are issued, and there's never any further

5

showing than that.

6

why it is that he can't comply.

8

Then it’s up to that officer to say

Well, it’s — yes, I am.

In other words, if he'd done what

he did in the Curcio case, which was get on the stand,

because of the privilege, which is exactly —

14

MR. WALLACE:

The — the -- but in the Curcio

15

case, the only thing contested at the appellate level

16

was his refusal to testify rather than his refusal to

17

produce the records.

18

not to testify if he claimed the privilege against

19

self-incrimination.

20

And what was upheld was his right

But the Court was very careful -- and this is

21

one of the cases that we draw our principle from — to

22

distinguish the question of producing the records that

23

he, because he held them in a representative capacity

24

had nc privilege not to produce.

claim of privilege is proper.

You agree with that?

that the subpoena asked him for.

QUESTION:

With respect to the testimony

Right.

And but, therefore, the

testimony on -- his direct testimony "I don't have the

10

record” is acceptable without subjecting himself to

11

cross examination.

That's what the case holds.

MR. WALLACE:

Curcio have been subject to cross examination on his

answer "I don't have the records?"

the issue of does he have them?

MR. WALLACE:

You know, not on the

with the Curcio opinion on his answer "I don't have the

12

HR. WALLACE;

Well, in -- in our view he could

13

be cross examined on both of those issues in the context

14

of the need to get compliance with the order to produce

15

the records.

16

what was at issue on appeal in Curcio was the question

You don't know any way out of that

MR. WALLACE:

Not at all.

The Court
QUESTION*

2

It's done constantly in trial

3

courts, isn't it, when — when there is an apparently

4

dubious assertion of the Fifth Amendment and cross

5

examination develops that there is no basis for a

6

genuine Fifth Amendment claim?
MR. WALLACE:

7

That is — is -- is precisely

8

the case.

And even when there is a proper basis for a

9

Fifth Amendment claim — and this is our basic point

10

here — what the Court has held time and again is that

11

once a witness chooses to offer testimony upon a fact

12

that's been put into issue, and in this context upon

13

whether he can produce the records, if he chooses to

14

contest that through is own testimony, that operates as

15

a waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege as to matters

16

reasonably related to that question, to the question on

17

direct examination.

18

QUESTION*

19

Curcio held squarely to the

contrary.
MR. WALLACE:

20

Well, that is not our view of

21

Curcio, because the production question was not what was

22

at issue.

And —

23

QUESTION:

24

think Curcio holds?

25

Well, would you tell me what you

MR. WALLACE:

It — it -- it holds that he can

as to the cross examination.

8

doing.

9

XR. WALLACE:

Exactly what this man was

That — that — that is correct

10

and — but all I can do is repeat that what was

11

contested was that whether he — he responded adequately

12

and waived his Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to

13

the order that he testified concerning the records.

14

Here we're not -- we're not trying to enforce

15

the subpoena requiring him to testify in face of his

16

Fifth Amendment claim at all.

17

he doesn't want to testify, he has to make some other

18

showing of why he can't produce the records.

19

chooses to make that showing through his testimony,

20

the normal principle of waiver of cross examination with

21

respect to related matter has to apply.

22

QUESTION:

We're just saying that if

And if he
then

Xr. Wallace, I'm not quite sure yet

23

that I understand your position.

Did I understand you

24

to say that if the individual here, the defendant,

25

suspect had simply taken the Fifth rather than making

the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

any effort to explain why he didn't have the records or

2

even to deny that he had them, could he have just said

3

as soon as you've made your prima facie case I claim the

4

privilege against self-incrimination?
MR* WALLACE;

5

He -- then I think he would be

6

subject to civil contempt, because he has done nothing

7

to satisfy his burden of production.
QUESTION;

8

9
10

So he would at least have had to

bring in the — a witness, a third party, for example,
to explain his situation.
MR. WALLACE;

11

We have made the requisite

12

showing.

13

That is the way we read the law and the cases.

14

Then there is a burden of production on him.

QUESTION;

Well, if he gets on the stand and

15

says I don't have them, even if he may not be cross

16

examined beyond that, you say that he hasn't made the

17

requisite showing.

18

MR. WALLACE:

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. WALLACE:

21

22

Well —

Don't you?

Don't you say that?

That is correct.

I mean at —

at — at the least that may not be entitled to credence.
QUESTION:

His uncross-examined -- his

23

uncross-examined assertion is not — he cannot use an

24

uncross-examined assertion to satisfy his burden of

25

showing why he can't produce.

1

MR. WALLACE*

2

QUESTION;

3

MR. WALLACE;

That is our position.

Yes.
And that is precisely the error

4

that we think the Court of Appeals made in this case.

5

The oath in purgation really was in the nature of a

6

pleaing of what it is that he could prove if he -- if he

7

put in his proof.
2UESTI3N;

8

9
10

In your view could he he then asked

and required to answer "Did you ever have possession of
them?”
MR. WALLACE*

11

I think that would be a proper

12

question on cross examination, and that if he chose to

13

testify on the subject he would have waived that.

14

would have waived any effort to find out from him what

15

became of the records.
QUESTION*

16

He

I'm not talking about a waiver.

17

I'm talking about a compelled answer.

Let's assume a

18

hypothetical now.

19

established by objective evidence other than his

20

testimony that at one time he was the secretary of the

21

corporation, and then he's asked where are these

22

records.

The man is put on the stand.

It's

He takes the Fifth Amendment.
Then the next question is "Did you ever have

23
24

these records in your possession?"

25

compelled?

Can that answer be

1

KB. WALLACE;

I rather doubt it, not in the

2

face of this Fifth Amendment claim, because it could be

3

a step in the chain of proof against him.

4

QUESTION!

But --

Without any explanation of how the

5

Fifth Amendment protection is required to explain

6

whether he ever had possession of them?

7
8

9

MR. WALLACE:

That -- that — that might be a

proper inquiry into whether he has a basis for the claim.
QUESTION:

But if he -- if he invokes the

10

Fifth Amendment in response to a question like that, the

11

District Court is entitled to weigh that invocation of

12

privilege against him in making a factual determination

13

as to whether he testified truthfully on the original

14

question, isn't it?

I mean this is a civil proceeding.

15

HR. WALLACES

16

QUESTION:

Yes, yes, that is correct also.

You can also say if you’re going to

17

take the Fifth Amendment and not make a showing, you're

18

going to have to produce the records because you just

19

haven't made -- unless you permit cross examination, you

20

just haven't satisfied your burden.

21

MR. WALLACE;

22

QUESTION:

That is precisely our position.

Well, I suppose -- doesn't the

23

court have to, on your motion to strike, simply strike

24

the preceding testimony and the answer?

25

then in the record in the way of evidence that he's

There's nothing

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

produced.

Isn’t that the reality the court must enforce?
HR. WALLACE*

2

That is our position.

That is

3

our position, that he has produced nothing except

4

something that's in the nature of a pleading that the

5

Court of Appeals erred in giving any evidentiary weight

6

to.

And —
QUESTION*

To carry

HR. HARBISON;

9

I don't think it would be

10

good.

It would be'’harder for the prosecution to prove

11

their case certainly because they -- one avenue of proof

12

is now gone.

QUESTION;

13
14

My point is -- I thought I made it

clear — this is the only evidence they had.
MR. HARBISON;

15
16

They won't have the company’s records.

Well, if that's the only

evidence they have, then it’s impossible.

17

QUESTION;

That's right.

18

MR. HARBISON;

19

QUESTION;

So he goes free.

That’s true.

Mr. Harbison, I just glanced over

20

Curcio again, and it didn't involve — the issue on

21

appeal didn't involve production at all.

22

criminal contempt for failure to answer questions for

23

which the privilege against self-incrimination was

24

claimed.

25

MR. HARBISON;

It involved

The

the Court said that the fact

2

that they were union records and not his personal

3

records didn’t mean that he couldn't invoke this

4

privilege against self-incrimination if questions about

5

the union records would in fact incriminate him.
Eut I don't see how that bears on the

6

7

production issue here at all.

Your client wasn't

8

sentenced for failure to answer a question to which he’d

9

raised the privilege.

He was sentenced for failure to

10

obey the summons order.

11

ME. HARBISONi

Yes, but he was sentenced for

12

that because he is unable because of the Fifth Amendment

13

to meet his burden.

14

QUESTION*

15

MR. HARBISONi

He’s not unable.

He’s unwilling.

Well, see, no one knows that.

16

It’s never been proved by the Government the records

17

exist.

18

If they don't exist, it’s impossible.
QUESTION*

But at this stage the Government

19

has come forward with enough, the Government says, so

20

that your client should take the laboring oar for a

21

while, and if he refuses, he's entitled to refuse under

22

the Fifth Amendment, but he's not entitled to go

23

scott-free of the summons order.

24
25

MR. HARBISONi

Well, therein lies the issue.

He has rowed the oar, I am arguing, by submitting his

affidavit, by appearing in front of the IRS agent

2

pursuant to the enforcement order and stating he does

3

not have them, and by taking the stand and saying he

cannot testify where they are.

those records, not keeping those records, and subjecting

himself to further criminal penalties.

Eut a defendant — but a defendant

-- counsel, in a criminal case where a defendant, for

19

instance, is charged with murder and the only people

20

present at the scene of the alleged murder were the

21

deceased and the defendant, now, if the defendant wants

22

to plead the Fifth Amendment so he can't take the stand

23

and say well, it was self-defense, then he risks going

24

to jail because he's convicted possibly of the offense

25

charged.

It puts him in a tough position to choose, but

3

get off the hook, or he pleads the Fifth and perhaps is

4

convicted.
Now, how is Mr. Rylander in this case in any

6

He either gives

worse position than that?
MR. HARBISON;

7

He’s in a much worse position,

8

Your Honor, because in your hypothetical that gentlemen

9

is not compelled.

He has a tactical choice to make,

10

albeit difficult.

In this case he either produces the

11

records or goes to jail.

12

your hypothetical the man has a tactical advantage about

13

whether or not to take the stand, and he listens to the

14

prosecution’s case, and if he feels it’s pretty strong,

15

then tactically he’s going to have to take the stand and

16

rebut it.

17

McGautha or Brooks v. Tennessee or U.S.

There is no uncertainty.

If he doesn’t, he stays off.

In

That's like
v. Jackson.

They’re cases that compelled the violation of

Mr. Harbison, suppose — suppose

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

at the enforcement hearing the Government made a prima

2

3

that you would agree to it, that that showing had been

4

made.

Then what is your client’s —
SR. HARBISONs

5

Then I would — I would say to

6

you, Your Honor, if you were the District Court judge

7

and we had legitimate presumption of possession because

8

somebody had shown it at the summons enforcement, which

9

wasn’t done here, I would cite to you the case of Kaggio.

And it's also -

QUESTION;

13

So you're -- what you're really

14

saying is that the Government — that there's no way the

15

Government can come back and meet its burden here when

16

he takes the Fifth Amendment.

17

MR. HARBISONs

No.

All he has to do is say I'm sorry,

I just can’t -- I don't have them.

them.

I can't produce

And that's the end of the case.
SR. HARBISONs

21

No.

There's a very good

22

factual distinction in Kaggio.

If they had of shown

23

possession at the summons enforcement, then you have a

24

legitimate continuing presumption at the contempt

25

hearing.

Then they have made their prima facie case of

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

contempt, and it's up to him to show present inability

2

to comply.

3

The burden would be on him.
QUESTION:

All right.

If he took the Fifth

Amendment then and refused to say another word and

produced no other evidence, he would be in trouble.

QUESTION:

Yes.

All right.

So when do you -- what

do you say the Government has to have proved, that they

were in existence once?

HR. HARBISON*

Yes.

At least to get -- the

11

Government makes a very novel argument on page 21 and 25

12

of their brief.

19

is we never showed he had possession.

20

They claim that the findings of fact

QUESTION;

That presumption carried
That's how they

So what they're saying to this Court

Well, it sounds to me like what you

21

really should argue is that — is that the turnover

22

order was infirm in that there never was a requisite

23

showing to substantiate or to support a turnover order.

24
25

HR. HARBISON:

If we were in a bankruptcy

proceeding, that would be precisely what I'm doing.

But

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in a summons enforcement, the issue of possession does

2

not arise.

3

only possession in Powell is that the IRS doesn't have

4

them, and hr. Rylander already beat Agent Vandenburg in

5

a prior summons enforcement by going to the Ninth

6

Circuit and showing that she did have possession.

7

lied in her affidavit.

8

possession, but the IRS did.

9

That's what this Court said in Powell.

QUESTION;

The

Is it — do you think the

10

Government -- I'll ask the other side -- but do you

11

think the Government agrees that at some point it has

12

the burden of showing existence?

13

NR. HARBISON;

I think they have, Your Honor,

14

because every case they've cited for the proposition

15

that they have this continuing presumption or that there

16

was a final appeal of our order — that is, res judicata

17

-- those cases that they cite found possession.

18

didn't find possession.

19

QUESTION;

They

Hell, the only difference between

20

-- it sounds to me like the only difference between you

21

two then is whether the Government has made an ample

showing of possession.

That’s why the Government

his showing and the burden goes back to them, they want

And then if he doesn’t produce them and the gentleman

comes in and says "I’m sorry; I don’t have them,” then

18

the Government has to -- has to prove by cl ear and

19

convincing evidence that they are in his po ssession and

20

under his control.

21

That’s what the Ninth C ircuit said.

MR. HARBISONs

Yes.

them” and takes a valid Fifth Amendment.

If he doesn’t have --

you think the judgment was wrong.

MR. HARBISONs

Well, if he doesn’t have a

valid Fifth Amendment, then under Transocean he has to

show detail why he doesn’t have.

Do you have anything

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL

10
11

MR. WALLACE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

We agree that we have to show in a contempt

13

hearing by clear and convincing evidence that he failed

14

to comply with a valid order.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. WALLACE:

Exactly.
But we don't agree with what the

17

Ninth Circuit said we have to show by clear and

18

convincing evidence.
QUESTION;

19

Well,

Mr. Wallace, don’t you — do

20

you think that at some place in this whole proceeding

21

the Government must produce at least probable cause to

22

believe that these records are in existence and that he

23

has them?

24
25

Is that ever a part of your case?
MR. WALLACE:

"probable cause."

I wouldn't use the term

QUESTION

2

is that you have —

Well, all right.

KR. WALLACE;

3

Then whatever it

We — it can be shown by

4

inference.

Ordinarily you would expect a corporation to

5

have records and the officer to have possession or

6

control of them, as it — there is a finding by the

7

District Court in this case on page 17A, Finding Number

8

7, "The defendant as president or other corporate

9

officer had possession or control or both of the books

10

and records of said corporation.”

11

partly on this inference from the circumstances, but

12

also on page 5U of the Joint Appendix there is testimony

13

by an Internal Revenue agent who interviewed Nr.

14

Rylander in

15

the records were in existence, and that they were at

16

Apex Bookkeeping, and an address was given by this agent

17

testifying about what Nr. Rylander said in the interview

18

at that time.

19

And this is based

1975, that he indicated that at that time

And I want to point out that in Curcio, unlike

20

this case, the Court pointed out quite specifically at

21

page 21 the conviction related solely to petitioner's

22

failure to answer questions as pursuant to the personal

23

subpoena ad testificandum.

24

failing to produce the books and records demanded in the

25

subpoena duces tecum.

He had not been charged with

He had been called to the stand

in Curcio pursuant to the subpoena ad testificandum, and

2

the questions were propounded to him.

3

In our situation he has been asked to produce

4

the records, and it was up to him either to produce them

5

or to submit third party testimony about why he couldn't

6

produce them or to take the stand.

legitimately do it because he refused to submit to cross

examination .

10

That's his choice of

But the court on pages 57 and 58 of the Joint

11

Appendix, the District Court made it quite clear that he

12

could purge himself of the contempt by — merely by

13

indicating his willingness to comply with the court's

14

order relating to the production of the documents,

15

unlike Curcio's situation where he was called to the

16

stand, and the contempt was in failing to answer

17

questions propounded to him.

18

come forward to this Court and in fact demonstrate that

19

he is incapable of doing so, which doesn't necessarily

20

require his own testimony.

Or he may forthrightly

The court's order didn't make clear

that third party witnesses would also suffice, did it?
HR. WALLACE;

HR. WALLACE;

That's right.

And that is

consistent with the court's explanation on page 56 of

the Joint Appendix.
