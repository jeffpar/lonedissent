ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL BORONKAY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF STATE PARTIES

MR. BORONKAY;

Mr. Chief Justic, and may it

10

please the Court, I would like first to give a brief

11

statement of the background of the case before

12

commencing argument.
This proceeding before the Court derives from

13
14

a suit filed by the State of Arizona in this Court in

15

1952 to determine its rights to Colorado River water.

16

That proceeding was heard by Special Master Simon

17

Rifkind, who after lengthy hearings filed a report with

18

the Court.

Nevada.

22

number of federal establishments, principally five

Indian reservations along the lower Colorado River.

of the reservations, and allocated water in accordance

Thereafter, in 1977, in connection with a

11

joint motion to enter a supplemental decree respecting

12

the listing of present perfected rights, which matter

13

was called for in Article VI of the 1964 decree, the

14

five tribes of these reservations sought to intervene

15

for the purpose of seeking additional water for the

16

reservations.

additional water for each of the reservations.

in the initial proceeding.

refer to it as the omitted lands issue.

hear claims of irrigable acreage for — based on

7

boundary changes made by the Secretary of the Interior

8

for the reservations subsequently to entry of the 1964

9

decree, and he ruled that the State Parties could not

10

challenge whether the irrigable acreage claim was in

11

fact within the boundaries of the reservations.

12

refer to this as the boundaries issue.

13

I will

Finally, he has ruled that it was proper for

14

the tribes to intervene as independent parties with

15

their own counsel to make claims for additional water

16

for the reservation, despite the claims — the defenses

17

of the three states based on the Eleventh Amendment, and

18

he permitted the United States to continue to make

19

claims for additional water on behalf of each of the

20

tribes.

21

I will now address these three issues, and my

22

colleague will address following certain issues,

23

equitable and legal, related to reopening the case, and

24

also discuss issues respecting Master Tuttle's findings

25

with regard to practicably irrigable acreage.

With respect to reopening the cas e to hear

1

2

claims that there existed additional irriga ble acreage

3

over that contended for by the United State s in the

4

original proceedings, Master Tuttle concede s at the

5

outset that were these claims to be made in a different

6

lawsuit, they would be subject to the bar o f res

7

judicata, that these claims are not indeed new claims,

8

but were within the issues originally tried and

9

determined some 20 years before.
He states, however, that Article IX of the

decree —

controversy

2

We submit that that language neither in its

3

form nor its purpose allows a party to come back many

4

years after final adjudication to reopen an issue on the

5

basis of perhaps an error in trial judgment or what

6

amounts to the splitting of a cause of action.

7

language of Article IX is found in major water

8

adjudications, particularly equitable apportionment

9

cases.

This

Its office and function is to permit the Court

10

to modify a decree due to changed cirumstances.

11

orientation is in the future.

12

means the decree is no longer workable, which means it

13

has to be modified to become workable.

14

Its

A changed condition which

We are aware of no case that has interpreted

15

language such as this to allow a party to come back

16

merely because he has a change of position, a different

17

position that he feels he should have taken and could

18

have taken in the original suit, and yet this is the

19

position urged by the United States and adopted by

20

Master Tuttle.

21

We submit that it is not only unprecedented,

22

but it is unsound to accept this interpretation, for it

23

obviously allows relitigation of issues finally

24

determined, casts an intolerable burden on the courts,

25

creates instability in judgments, and, of course, adds

2

unnecessary costs to litigants.
QUESTIONS

What do you suggest was the purpose

3

in the original report and action of this Court in

4

leaving some of these matters open for adjustments?

5

MR. BORONKAYs

The adjustment that I believe

6

the Chief Justice refers to would be the boundary

7

adjustments in Article 11(D)(5) of the decree, and that

8

is a specific provision that permits the reopening for a

9

specific purpose, and I will indicate that the condition

10

of reopening for that purpose has not been met in this

11

case, but with regard to Article IX, that is -- I might

12

call it a phrase of art.

13

statement reserving jurisdiction for any purposes.

14

has a certain function to fulfill, and that is the

15

modification of a decree for changes in the future.

16

It is not just a bland, broad
It

We submit that Article IX in no way permits a

17

party merely to say that if he had a second chance he

18

could do better, and that is the use being made of that

19

article here.

20

QUESTIONS

I suppose if the use of Article IX

21

made here is acceptable, one of the states or the lower

22

basin states — basin states, either one could ask to

23

relitigate the division of water --

24
25

MR. BORONKAYs

Precisely.

Indeed, if Article

IX may be read so broadly, and we don't think it should,

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

there vouli be no reason for any party having an

2

interest to come in and relitigate matters if they feel

3

they have certain equities, or they believe they could

4

do better.

5

peroidic reopening of this case for claims of irrigable

6

acreage.

7
8

Moreover, I believe there could be the

QUESTION;

This wouldn't be the last of it,

either.

9

MB. BORONKAYi

Indeed, it would not.

I

10

foresee future generations of United States Attorneys

11

wanting to second guess their predecessors, and

12

utilizing current technology, saying, indeed, we might

13

have asked for a greater amount of irrigable acreage

14

than was claimed 20 years earlier, and I don't see any

15

place to stop that process.
Moreover, Article IX was proposed by Master

16
17

Rifkind.

18

again and again that he was striving for a certainty so

19

far as possible of water rights and finality of a

20

decree, and he is the master that urged this

21

terminology, and yet it would be used to undermine his

22

purpose.

23

Master Rifkind made it clear in the record

Accordingly, we feel there was no basis for

24

reopening the litigated matter which Judge Tuttle

25

indicates was litigated, and Article IX provides no

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

basis for relitigating some 20 years later.
If there are no questions/ I will turn to the

2
3

boundaries issue# if I may.

With respect to the

4

boundariers determination of Master Tuttle, we

5

respectfully submit his treatment is no more defensible

6

than with respect to the reopening issue.

7

recalled that the boundary issue was fully tried in the

8

first litigation, that California protested that some of

9

the boundaries being urged by the United States were

It is to be

10

wrong, that the irrigable acreage on parts of the Mojave

11

and Colorado River Indian Reservations were outside the

12

reservations, and therefore had no basis for a Winters

13

doctrine water right.
QUESTIONi

14

Were the boundaries in dispute, all

15

those that had federal lands on one side and tribal

16

lands on the other?
HR. BORONKAYi

17

To my recollection, there are

18

federal lands abutting the Indian reservations in the

19

case of Fort Mojave and Colorado River.

20

California in protesting these boundary determinations

21

of the United States raised that issue.

22

States joined in that issue.

23

its being tried, and indeed it was fully tried, and for

24

the most part, the boundaries were found to be

25

incorrect.

And so,

The United

QUESTION;

What did we do with that

determination?
MR. BORONKAY :

This Court adopted the

4

irrigable acreage that was computed based on the

5

boundary determination , adopted the water allocated

6

dependent on the amoun t of acreage so computed, but

7

rejected the findings as to the boundaries as being

8

unnecessary.

9
10

11

QUESTION;

W ell, we set it aside.

We didn't

adopt that -MR. BORONKAY s

This Court did not adopt the

12

boundary findings, tho ugh it did adopt the acreage that

13

was calculated —

14

QUESTION:

Y es, yes.

15

MR. BORONKAY :

16

QUESTION:

Y es.

— on those boundaries,
As long as that was the

17

acreage within the bou ndaries as then -- as the Master

18

had determined, but we didn't say those were the

19

boundaries.

20
21

MR. BORONKAY :

This Court did not determine

the boundaries —

22

QUESTION:

What is 11(D)(5)?

23

MR. BORONKAY:

What is that?

11(D)(5) provides in setting

24

forth the allocations of water for the different

25

reservations, that provision states that these

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

allocations with respect to Fort Mojave and the Colorado

2

River Indian Reservation, that the allocations being

3

adopted by this Court that Master Rifkind found were

4

subject to adjustment in the event the boundaries are

5

finally determined.

6

And so, the issue before the Court today is

7

whether the United States could properly avail itself of

8

Article 11(D)(5), whether it has made a showing that the

9

boundaries of these — the disputed boundaries of these

10
11

two reservations had been finally determined.
QUESTION:

Well, the Master thought that he

12

was finally determining them, didn’t he?

13

litigated between adverse parties.

14

enough for this Court, I take it.

15

MR. B0R0NKAY:

They had been

And that wasn’t good

Master Rifkind had attempted to

16

determine the boundaries, and it wasn’t good enough for

17

this Court, and I suggest that it wasn’t good enough for

18

this Court for the reason that this Court was concerned

19

with the possibility that due to the states'

20

participation, the parens patriae doctrine would bind

21

other parties that might have land claims who were not

22

parties to the suit.

23

Accordingly, this Court rejected the findings

24

as to boundaries, but the matter might have been

25

finished at that point with respect to irrigable acreage

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of each reservation, and as to the water allocation

2

dependent on irrigable acreage.

3

doctrine of res judicata would have bound all the

4

parties to the irrigable acreage determination had not

5

the Court in 11(D)(5) given the United States another

6

chance, so to speak, an extra chance.

7

I suggest that the

But I do not feel this Cou.rt intended by

8

giving the United States the extra chance that it could

9

determine those boundaries, conclusively on the adverse

10

party by unilateral action such as it has presented in

11

this case.

12

orders based on surveys of boundaries for approximately

13

90 percent of its boundary claim, and for approximately

14

10 percent it relies on four or five judgments, most of

15

which are stipulated judgments.

16

In this case, it relies on secretarial

In neither of these situations are the parties

17

adversely affected, the State Parties, given any

18

opportunity to participate in the determination of those

19

boundaries, and yet the United States says we are bound

20

by those boundaries.

21

affected by those boundary determinations, which include

22

or exclude irrigable acreage, and yet the United States

23

comes forward and says it may unilaterally determine

24

those boundaries for the purpose of modifying water

25

allocations of these reservations which resulted from a

Our water rights are directly

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

complete adjudication with all adverse parties present.

2

We submit that that wasn’t the intent of this

3

Court.

4

that were tried and found to be incorrect before Special

5

Master Rifkind were to be conclusively imposed upon the

6

State Parties by virtue of having the stamp of approval

7

of the Secretary of the Interior some years later.
QUESTION*

8
9
10

It would be ironic indeed if the very boundaries

Have any actions been filed by the

states separately to contest the boundaries as
determined by the Secretary of Interior?
MR. BORONKAYs

11

Yes.

Because of the concern as

12

to Special Master Tuttle’s rulings, the Metropolitan

13

Water District filed in the United States District Court

14

approximately a year and a half ago an action in both

15

declaratory relief and under the Administrative

16

Procedures Act to test the administrative orders.

17

action is still pending.

19

immunity of the United States, for statute of

limitations purposes.

25

in the land itself.

The states don't claim any interest
You are concerned only with the

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

water rights attached to it which might change because

2

of the boundary change.

3

MR. BORONKAYs

Is that right?
That is correct.

We are

4

directly affected by that boundary just as an adjoining

5

landowner would be directly affected by their boundary.

6

We are affected for a species of real property, water,

7

as opposed to land.

8

So, for these reasons, we feel that the

9

mischief that could result from a ruling that the

10

boundary determinations of the Secretary of the Interior

11

is very great when we consider that these reservations

12

all abutt vast federal acreage under the ruling -- under

13

the control of the Secretary of the Interior, and that

14

he again and again surveys and resurveys land, and by

15

doing so he can add a great irrigable acreage to the

16

reservations, give them an additional water right with

17

an early priority, adverse to our position, and under

18

the proposed interpretation of the United States, we

19

would have no ability to contradict those boundary

20

determinations no matter how obviously wrong they were.

21

QQESTIONi

We are talking about what the

22

boundaries of the reservations were when the suit was

23

started, aren’t we?

24

MR. E0B0HKAY:

25

2UESTI0M:

We are actually --

We are talking about -- What did

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

Master Rifkind purport to find?

2

MR. B0R0NKAY;

3

QUESTION;

4

He rejected the —

What kind of boundaries?

The

boundaries at the time the suit started.
MR. BORONKAY;

5

He essentially found with

6

regard to the two reservations -- there are five now

7

that have boundary questions.

8

that time.

9

10

QUESTION;

Yes.

MR. BORONKAY;

There were only two at

Yes.
With respect to the Colorado

11

River Indian Reservation, he found that the intended

12

boundary, the west bank of the Colorado River, was to be

13

the boundary as the river imperceptibly moved.

14

QUESTION;

Yes.

15

MR. BORONKAY;

The United States took a

16

position that the boundary was a fixed boundary.

17

they sought to determine meander lines, and —

18
19

20

QUESTION;

Hence

Were these reservations established

by Act of Congress, or by executive order, or by -MR. BORONKAY;

Some by executive order and

21

some by Acts of Congress, and I can't tell you at this

22

moment whether the Colorado River Indian Reservation was

23

one or the other.

24

With respect to Fort Mojave —

25

QUESTION;

But you are not — the question

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

isn’t whether or not that a reservation that had a --

2

whose boundaries were not in dispute during this lawsuit

3

could now be changed, and the boundaries just expanded.

4

That is not the issue.

5

MR. B0R0NKAY;

It is not the issue in that we

6

have no land interest, and —

7

QUESTION:

This is what is the accurate

8

boundary at some time in the past.

9

MR. B0R0NKAY:

It is what the boundary was in

10

the past, but the Secretary of the Interior in actions

11

taken subsequently to the 1964 decree purports to

12

restore lands, adding irrigable acreage, which he would

13

like recognized as always having been part of the

14

reservations.

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

MR. B0R0NKAY:

Now, we submit that when you

17

consider all the acreage that it is possible to add to

18

the reservations and give them additional water rights

19

to the detriment of the State Parties, we feel that the

20

United States has not met the condition of Article

21

11(D)(5) that there have been a final determination of

22

the boundaries for the purpose of modifying an

23

adjudicated water right, a right of each of these

24

reservations which resulted from a full adjudication.

25

We don't feel that merely Secretarial action,

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

administrative action, valid for administrative

2

purposes, is the type of action or activity that should

3

permit the United States unilaterally to come in and

4

say, now, we can modify the water rights and you can't

5

challenge it.

6

I believe this Court intended that we either

7

have the opportunity to challenge those water -- the

8

boundaries for water adjudication purposes or, as we

9

conclude, the United States is premature.

They have

10

come to the Court in advance of being able to show that

11

the boundaries have been finally determined.

12

I may illustrate that with the Fort Yuma

3

Reservation, where there have been various solicitor

4

opinions over a 40-year period recognizing particular

5

boundaries, but the day before the United States filed

6

its motion you had a new solicitor's opinion that

7

ignored the three prior opinions and added 25,000 acres

I would like in the moments left to turn to

22

the question of the intervention of the tribes.

Master

23

Tuttle allowed the five tribes to intervene despite

24

objections of the three states urging their Eleventh

25

Amendment rights.

In doing so, he relied on Section —

That case permitted the

13

The case reasoned that 1362 permitted the

treated the tribes as being in the same position as the

the tribes are to be treated the same as the United

United States Attorneys with respect to these lands to

get it in our minis.

4

dr. Warner, the United States Attorney who

5

tried the case, indicated to Master Bifkind that the

6

decree will serve the purpose of res judicata for the

7

maximum water for the reservations, and that there would

8

be no claim for other lands on the reservations even

9

though they may be irrigable, and he felt also, as he

10

indicated, that it was his duty to prove to the full

11

extent that he could the Indian water claims, and also

12

that the maps which they put into evidence showing the

Mr. Hunsaker, to what extent does

11

the larger amount of practically irrigable acreage found

12

by the present Special Master come from examining new

13

technology?

14

ME. HUNSAKER:

In that regard, there -- most

15

of the lands submitted by the tribes comes from the

16

examination of new technology, so-called sprinkler and

17

drip irrigation, and so virtually a large percent, and I

18

cannot tell you the exact percentage now, but a large

19

percent of the lands presented by the tribes themselves

20

at this time comes from those technological advances.

21

QUESTION:

Well, is that land that couldn't be

22

irrigated by other traditional methods that were in

23

effect at the time of the previous decree?

24
25

MR. HUNSAKER:

No, the testimony in the case

would indicate that these lands were somewhat hilly, and

2

economics of doing that may have been prohibitive.

3

We feel that the fact that the current United

4

States Attorneys choose to ignore the assurances of

5

their predecessors of the fifties cannot serve as a

6

basis for relitigation of the issues.

7

are saying that our predecessors cannot bind us, and we

8

do not believe that Court decrees should be treated so

9

lightly, but in fact deserve finality.

10

In effect, they

We think, that in Article IX, when this Court

11

indicated that it would retain jurisdiction for matters

12

which were "deemed proper," that this was not mere

13

surplusage of language, but that this Court intended

14

that in order to come back before the Court with

15

additional matters, that they must indeed be proper, and

16

we feel that in this effort, that Article IX should not

17

be construed so broadly as to make this attempt at

18

relitigation proper, and even if it were to be so

19

considered, that nevertheless the preclusive doctrines

20

about which we have briefed and talked about this

21

morning should prevent this effort.

Are you to be understood as saying

that Article IX was not intended to allow a sort of

MR. HUNSAKER:

insufficient evidence.

any direct evidence that was presented in the trial, and

to preclude the representation of evidence, he cites

13

only one brief, and that is the Imperial Irrigation

14

District, versus all of the evidence that Master Rifkind

15

sought from in the way of admissions from the United

16

States Attorneys and put on the record himself that he

17

intended the litigation of the Indian issues to be

18

final.

19

Indeed, Master Tuttle cites, we submit, in his

And we feel that it is overwhelming in the

20

history of the transcript of these proceedings in the

21

1950’s that it was intended to be and should be final.

And indeed the United States supported it

12

affirm the 1964 decree as written, and return the

parties to their stated reliance upon that decree.

14

On the other hand, if Article IX is broad

15

enough to permit the reopening of the nature that

16

occurred before Master Tuttle, then we submit that it is

17

likewise broad enough to reopen for all purposes.

18

some of those purposes that were presented to Master

19

Tuttle and rejected by him as not appropriate are the

20

fact that this Court in the interim since 1964 decided

21

two very important cases that defined further the

22

reserved water rights doctrine, those cases being United

23

States versus New Mexico and the State of Washington

24

versus the Washington State Commercial Passenger Vessels

And

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The definitions and guidelines which were

1

2

rendered by this Court in those two decisions, we

3

submit, are that the reservation doctrine only reserves

4

that amount of water which is for the primary purposes

5

for which the reservation was created, and not for any

6

secondary purposes which it may serve, and further, that

7

though there may be a maximum reserve — reserved water,

8

that the — that doesn’t necessarily mean that the

9

particular people involved will receive that full

10

amount, but they will receive the amount of that scarce

11

natural resource that is necessary to provide them with

12

a moderate living.
These decisions came down in

13

'78 and

'79

14

respectively.

We submitted to Master Tuttle the

15

question on the basis that if he construed Article IX

16

broadly enough to permit a reopening, then it, too,

17

should be construed broadly enough to permit a reopening

18

to look at these issues and see whether or not there

19

should be a revision of the decree of 1964 based upon

20

these new guidelines that have been presented by this

21

Court in these two decisions.

this kind of evidence, and of course that came to a halt

14

when our motions were denied.

15

There is also a very practical problem that

16

Arizona some day must face, and that is that there is so

17

much Indian land in the state that if the practicable

18

irrigable acreage standard is to be applied throughout

19

the state, then the existing water supply could only

20

supply one-third of the Indian reservation lands, and

21

none of the non-Indian lands, and we feel that this

issues, and so they referred the federal court

proceedings to the state courts.

The United States and the Indian tribes there

involved appealed those decisions to the Ninth Circuit,

and the Ninth Circuit has now held that Arizona may not

further, I think the Court will see what we have

asserted in the briefs, but I would like to simply say

4

that some of the legal questions with respect to the

5

factual issues are as follows, and some of the factual

6

questions.

7

This Court may not wish to reweigh all of the

8

evidence from this lengthy trial, but we did except to

9

some of the findings of Special Master Tuttle, and as to

10

the United States claims, the errors relate to the lands

11

which even the United States experts projected to be

12

only marginally profitable, but they based such

13

projections on yields and production costs and power

14

rates that we feel are not properly established in the

15

evidence and resulted in a shifting of the burden of

16

proof to the states rather than the Master requiring the

17

burden of proof to be carried by the United States.

18

As to the Indian tribe claims, the errors, we

19

submit, relate to lands which the Master found

20

profitable, and thus deserving of a permanent water

21

right based only on the projection of what we have

22

termed exotic crops, crops without a commercial history,

23

unproven in the area.

MR. HUNS AKER;

Well, I believe, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, that it is proposed essentially now on all

considerable evidence in particular about that on the

is the area where there was some evidence with respect

to some attempts at grape growing that did not last on

But the Master with respect to crop prices

17

used a method that was not employed by any of the

experts in the case, including those hired by the Indian

tribes, and also did not take into account the law of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE A. ASCHENBRENNER, ESQ.,

2

ON BEHALF OF THE INDIAN TRIBES

3

MR. ASCHENBRENNEF;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

4

it please the Court, the tribes relied on the

5

government's brief on the boundary dispute issue, and so

6

I intend to defer that question to Mr. Claiborne, and

7

proceed with the question of the omitted lands and the

8

other issues raised by counsel for the states.

9

The states say that the 1964 decree can't be

10

reopened because, one, res judicata bars it, two,

11

Article IX does not authorize it, and three, the law of

12

the case precludes it.

13

three grounds.

We say they are mistaken on all

cause of action, a different case.

17

case.

18

authorizes any change whatsoever.

19

law of the case does not bar reopening where there has

20

been a gross error which the states admit, where this

21

error has caused manifest injustice to one of the

22

parties, and there has been no significant showing of

23

detrimental reliance upon the other party.

This is the same

concerns drip irrigation, and drip irrigation the

14

states* experts contended could be substituted and

replaced with, if it didn't work properly, sprinkler

irrigation.

that way.

QUESTION:

No.

Well, that is why we are

reviewing his findings.
SR. ASCHENBRENNER:

5

All that the tribes are

6

asking for is to apply the same standard that was

7

applied in the original case, practicably irrigable

8

acres standard to determine what water should be

9

allocated.

10

QUESTION*

Yes, but I asked you about what

11

sort of a gross error it was that you claimed should

12

allow this matter to be reopened after all these years.

13

And it boils down to just the fact that by hindsight,

14

the government should have been more aggressive or more

15

assertive, or whatever you want to say, that maybe they

16

could have gotten more if they had asked for it, but

17

that is not even a doctrine for reopening under a law of

18

the case, as I understand it.

19

SR. ASCHENBRENNER:

Your Honor, we are not

20

merely saying that hindsight, that now because of

21

hindsight it is apparent they made a mistake.

the methodology was totally flawed.

Why do you say that?

anyone whose standing under the decree when entered

20

would object to a reopening, whether in '65 or now.

21

Their claims might have been better the more time had

22

elapsed.

23

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

Well, I suppose one thing

24

it gets back to, Your Honor, is Article IX, which

25

expressly provides for reopening.

Contrary to the

apportionment cases, this provision was submitted by the

3

Imperial Irrigation District for the express purpose of

avoiding a claim of res judicata against the United

States, and to correct any error that the United States

might suggest to the Court had occurred --

MR. ASCHENBRENNER;

Pardon me.

MR. ASCHENBRENNER;

10

And they submitted this,

11

Your Honor, on January 11th, 1963, long after the issue

12

of equitable apportionment went out of the case.

13

all the parties agreed to it.

14

QUESTION;

And

Do you contend that Article IX

15

would allow any party to reopen any question if they

16

found that they simply hadn't made as strong claims as

17

they now thought they should have?

18

MR. ASCHENBRENNER:

19

QUESTION;

No, Your Honor.

Then how do you distinguish your

20

claim from that of, say, the states, who might feel, as

they aparently do, that had they asked for more, asked

for it in a different way in

2

you can find a gross error, where the other party had

not changed his position and relied to his detriment,

MR. ASCHENBRENNER;

10

No, but he didn't find

11

against us.

In Footnote 71 of his report, he expressly

12

found it unnecessary to determine whether there was a

13

conflict or whether the conflict of interest prevented

14

the tribes from being bound, citing Hansberry versus

15

Lee, because he found we had a right to reopen under

16

Article IX, so he did not reach the issue of inadequacy

17

of representation.
And under Article IX, we are not compelled to

show inadequacy of representation under due process

grounds.

a grievous error, lack of detrimental reliance.

We merely have to show, as Judge Tuttle found,

Your definition of any grievous

error, I suppose, is any claim that might have been made

MR. ASCHENBRENNERi

No, I would say you

As Judge Tuttle said, you only

There is no good cause to change the practicably

irrigable acreage standard.

And the same

If there is a good reason

16

What the -- I think the states are arguing is

17

that — or I should say what they are doing, I believe,

18

is confusing the grounds for reopening with the standard

19

to be used once reopened, it is determined that the

20

decree should be opened.

21

and we agree that the mere fact there has been change in

22

technology is no ground to reopen the decree.

23

fact that if we came into Court today and more acreage

24

would be irrigable because of advanced technology is not

25

a ground to reopen.

Justice — Judge Tuttle found,

applied, but Judge Tuttle found that was ground for

But he said, now, having found grounds for

reopening, he said, then it only makes sense to apply

6

today's technology, because it would just complicate the

7

case to go back and look at the technology in 1956 to

took no exceptions to it.

13

That issue should be out of the case.

14

only thing the states did was ask the Master to

determine the technology at the time the reservations

were created.

The states suggest that there would be no

injustice to the tribes because this Court approved of

22

the Special Master's holding, Special Master Rifkind's

holding that the acreage he found was reasonable.

24

what this Court held was that "The various acreages of

2

the states suggest that what he is talking about is a

3

determination that the number of acres found was

4

reasonable.

5

Now,

We suggest what the Court — the Court had

6

just previously said two sentences above, that the

7

tribes were entitled to all the practicably irrigable

8

acres on the reservation, and therefore that couldn't be

9

what it intended, it must have intended merely to

10

approve of the determination of irrigability of the

11

acres that the Special Master awarded.

12

With respect to the timing of our motion and

13

the state's claimed reliance, our motions were filed in

1977 and '78,

15

there was any substantial certainty with respect to the

told the Congress when they got the Central Arizona

12

Project authorized that there was far less water than

14

to the fact that the Upper Basin states have not used

15

the water as fast as was anticipated.

16

In other words, Arizona

This is largely due

Third, the states knew that the boundary

17

disputes had not been determined, and that the tribes,

18

if they won the boundary disputes, would be entitled to

19

more water, so there was uncertainty with respect to

20

even the additional Indian claims.

21

The Metropolitan Water District claims

22

reliance, arguing that after the *64 decree, they went

23

to their own water project and asked for additional

24

water to take the place of the water they lost to

25

Arizona, but they did not ask for any additional water

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

for the water they lost to the Indians.

They lost

2

550,000 acres feet to Arizona, and they lost 55,000 acre

3

feet to the Indians, but they didn’t ask their own

4

California Water Project for that — to make up for the

5

55,000.
Now, today, in this case we are only asking

6
7

for 16,000 additional acre feet for the Indians, or less

8

than one-third of the 55,000.

District's excuse for not asking for the original 55,000

Metropolitan Water

10

was that it was such a relatively minor amount, it was

11

unnecessary.

12

go after 55,000 acres and supplement it, is it

13

reasonable to believe that they would think

14

such an enormous amount that it would change their

position?

16

Well, we suggest if they didn’t bother to

16,000 was

Furthermore, the Metropolitan Water District

17

right now is using 1.3 million acre feet.

The 16,000

18

acre feet we are claiming is just a fraction more than

19

percent of their water, well within the range of

20

estimating accuracy, the closest to which they claim

21

they can estimate in the river is 10 percent.

22

Finally, what the states are really

23

complaining about is injury or impact rather than

24

detrimental reliance, but even the injury they claim is

25

not to the extent to which it is claimed.

such provisions do typically address the question of

MR. CLAIBORNE*

If I may turn to the question

2

of boundaries, I should say first that the boundary

3

adjustments in this case would entitle the tribes with

4

respect to the acreage which had been restored to their

5

reservations to a total of about 127,000 acre feet of

6

diversions from the —

7

QUESTION*

Why do you call it restored?

Do

8

you say that it was perfectly clear at the time the

9

Special Master determined boundaries that he correctly

10

determined them, but that the United States has now just

11

enlarged the boundaries, or what?

12

MR. CLAIBORNE*

Mr. Justice White, no.

We say

13

that the Secretary and some Supreme Court judgments have

14

determined what the original boundaries were.

15

QUESTION*

Well, that isn’t restoring.

16

MR. CLAIBORNE*

Restoring in the factual sense

17

that these areas had been deprived of reservation status

18

in the interim, and now they have been restored to their

19

reservation status --

Well, had the Department of

reserva tion ?
MR. CLAIBORNE*

2

The Department of the Interior

3

had been ambiguous about the status of these boundary

4

lands, and so Master Rifkind found.

5

disallowance of the boundary claims which were advanced

6

by the lawyers in litigation on behalf of the Department

7

of Justice was in part premised on the fact that the

8

Interior Department had been ambivalent in its

9

characterization of the contested lands, and he found no

10

final or formal or clear ruling from the Land Department

11

as to these areas being included within the reservation,

12

and accordingly, thought himself free to decide the

13

matter for himself.

14

Indeed, his

21

Justice White, no, the —

The problem before was that

there were solicitor’s opinions looking one way, and

23

there were other administrative actions looking the

other way.

This Court from its study of

1

ambiguities that ran arise from maps which show one

2

thing and rulings which show another, and sometimes

3

inconsistent rulings.

4

Now, at the highest level, the Department of

5

the Interior, after full consideration, has formally,

6

finally, and unambiguously determined what the true

7

boundaries of each of these reservations is.

8

ambivalent about the present status.

9

QUESTION:

Well, unless it changes its mind in

10

the next Administration.

11

HR. CLAIBORNE;

12
13
14

Nothing

We have no reason to

anticipate such a change. Justice White.
QUESTION;

Nr. Claiborne, has it been finally

resolved as to the Fort Mojave Reservation as well?

15

HR. CLAIBORNE;

It has. Justice O'Connor.

16

Now, no one questions that this function of

17

determining, of defining the boundaries of an Indian

18

Reservation is one peculiarly left to the Department of

19

the Interior, that department which has a special

20

responsibility with respect to the public lands of the

21

United States, and also a special responsibility with

22

respect to Indian affairs.

23

At least those formal administratively final

24

decisions of the Department of the Interior are entitled

25

to a presumption of correctness, and they must be given

59

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

effect until and unless the court with jurisdiction sets

2

them aside, or until and unless they are

3

administratively set aside, which is an occurrence not

4

to be anticipated.
For all other purposes, these boundaries have

5
6

been treated as final and fixed.
QUESTION:

7

Mr. Claiborne, can I just interrupt

8

on this?

9

I understand your opponents, they argue they had no

10

opportunity — they are treated as though they were

11

conclusively correct.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

12

13

You say they are presumptively correct, but as

Justice Stevens, I say at

least they are presumptively correct.
QUESTION:

14

But that doesn't win the case for

15

you.

Isn't it your position they are conclusively

16

correct for the purpose of the case?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

17

We don't have to, Justice

18

Stevens, I think, take the position that they are not

19

subject to challenge in the judicial proceeding

20

elsewhere.

purposes of determining the respective water rights, are

4

they not immune from challenge under the Master's

5

decree, and your opponents were not given an opportunity

6

to challenge?

7

Or do I misread the report?

HR. CLAIBORNE;

We do say. Justice Stevens,

8

that in this proceeding, in this Court, in light of the

9

Court's own ruling in 1973, there is no occasion to

10

review these decisions.

11

State Parties will in other forums be deprived of an

12

opportunity to challenge.

13

QUESTION;

That does not mean that the

Well, Mr. Claiborne, what is your

14

— the United States' position in these other forums?

15

Are you taking the position that the Secretary's

16

proceedings are open to review, or are you moving to

17

dismiss for want of jurisdiction, or on sovereign

18

immunity grounds?

19

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Justice White, as was

20

correctly stated, I think, by Mr. Boronkay, the United

21

States has in the proceeding filed in the Southern

22

District of California submitted a motion to dismiss

to follow the indications of its prior decision with

respect to these boundary questions, remembering this.

22

Were it not for the decree of this Court in 1964, water

23

would presently be allocated to these boundary lands

24

because there are final determinations administratively

25

as to these boundaries, and because those lands have

This Court enjoined the Secretary from

granting water to such lands until either there was an

agreement of the parties or this Court itself entered a

further decree.
