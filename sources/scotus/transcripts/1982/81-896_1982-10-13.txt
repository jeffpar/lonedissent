ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT H. CHANIN, Esg.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT, PERRY EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
MR. BALL:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court:

This case arises in a Washington school

11

12 district in

Indiana.

Indiana has enacted a statute

13 governing the labor relations of its public school
14 teachers.

Like the National Labor Relations Act and the

15 public sector labor relations statutes in other states,
16 it adopts the principle of exclusive recognition.
17

Under that principle, the union selected by

18 the majority of teachers in an appropriate bargaining
19 unit is authorized and indeed obligated to represent all
20 teachers in that unit,
21

22

whether they are members of the

union or not, in dealing with the school district.
In 1977 an election was held in the Perry

23 Township school district to select an exclusive
24 representative for the teachers.

The competing

25 organizations in that election were the Appellant, PEA,

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and the Appellee, PLEA.

During the election campaign

2 itself, both organizations were treated equally and they
3 were accorded the same opportunity to sell their
4 programs, their activities, and their ideas to the
5 voting teachers.
6

The teachers voted and chose PEA as the

7 exclusive representative.

PEA subsequently entered into

8 a collective bargaining agreement with the school
9 district.

Among other things, the agreement gave PEA

10 access to the individual teacher mailboxes, which are
11 name slots which appear in each school building, and to
12 the inter-school mail system, which is a courier service
13 by means of which the district delivers material from
14 school building to school building.
15

The collective bargaining agreement expressly

16 stated that these rights are given to PEA -- and this is
17 the quote from the agreement — "acting as the
18 representative of the teachers."

And that article went

19 on to deny to other employee organizations, including
20 PLEA, access to those school mail facilities.
21

The PLEA and two of its members challenged

22 this access restriction as violative of the First
23 Amendment and the equal protection clause of the
24 Fourteenth Amendment.

The district court granted

25 summary judgment for Defendants, but the Seventh Circuit

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

\

1

2

Court of Appeals reversed.
The Court of Appeals held that it is

3

unconstitutional for a school district to distinguish

4

between the exclusive collective bargaining

5

representative and rival unions in granting access to

6 internal communication facilities.
7

This holding, which

would invalidate the prevailing practice in public

8 sector labor law throughout this country, is
9

inconsistent in several respects, we believe, with the

10

principles announced by this Court.

11

defect, however, is its failure to recognize the

12

distinction that this Court has drawn b etween public

13

and non-public forums in determining the

14

constitutionality of access restrictions.

15

Its overriding

It is appropriate to begin analysis by setting

16

forth the two standards that this Court has adopted.

17

the property in question constitutes a public forum, the

18

government's right to restrict access is subject to

19

rather stringent limitations.

Generally speaking, it

20 only may impose reasonable time, place and manner
21

restrictions which are content-neutral and narrowly

22 drawn to meet a compelling governmental interest.
23

A different standard applies if the property

24

is not a public forum.

Although we are not suggesting

25

in any sense that government is free to act without

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

If

1

restraint, the test is a less stringent one.

The access

2 restriction is constitutional if it is reasonable on the
3

one hand, and is not designed to prohibit access because

4

the government disapproves of a speaker's view or seeks

5

to favor one point of viaw over another.
It is within this framework that we believe

6
7

the issue before the Court can be best analyzed, and we

8 believe that issue can be divided into two subsidiary
9

questions.

The first is, which of the two standards is

10

appropriately applied to the school mail facilities?

11

Once that is determined, the second question is whether

12

the challenged access policy meets the appropriate

13

standard.
Although the court below found that the school

14
15

mail facilities are a nonpublic forum, it did not judge

16

the constitutionality of the access policy by the

17

standard that this Court has held applies to such

18

forums.

19

and concluded that the policy failed to pass

It applied instead the public forum standard

20 constitutional muster under that standard.

It is our belief that the latter conclusion is

21

22 wrong in its own right and that the access policy here
23

in question is sustainable even under the more stringent

24

standard.

25

question in this case.

But there is no occasion to reach that
We submit that the dispositive

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

flaw in the decision of the court below is its failure

2 to use the proper standard to judge the
3

constitutionality of this access policy to this

4

nonpublic forum.
The Appellees appear to concede this.

5

They

6 make no attempt to defend the analysis or approach taken
7

by the court below.

To the contrary, they acknowledge

8 the importance of the distinction between the standards
9

governing access to public and nonpublic forums, and

10

devote much of their argument to an effort to

11

demonstrate that the school mail facilities are a public

12 forum.
13

Me submit this effort fails.

Under the

14

relevant legal principles set forth by this Court, most

15

recently last term in United States Postal Service v.

16

Council of Greenburgh Civic Association, it is clear

17

that the school mail facilities involved in this case

18

are a nonpublic forum.

19

It is well established that certain government

20 property is by its very nature a public forum;
21

streets,

parks, highways, and certain analogous facilities which

22 historically have been used for purposes of public
23

assembly and debate.

24

be traditional public forums.

25

These, I think the reference would

Although it may sometimes be difficult to

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

determine whether a particular facility is sufficiently

2 analogous to a park or a street to be classed as a
3 traditional public forum, again
4 concern here.

this question is of no

So one is suggesting that the school mail

5 facilities are in any sense like the parks, like the
6 streets, or like the highways.

It is conceded that they

7 are not a traditional public forum.

But that of course is not the end of the

8
9 matter.

Government may by its actions convert what

10 otherwise would be a non-public forum into
11

a public

forum, and Appellees contend that that is what has

12 happened here.

It is their position as we understand it

13 that the school mail facilities have been converted into
14 a public forum to which they have a constitutional right
15 of access, and because of the existence.of

that right

16 the access policy before the Court must be judged by the
17 more stringent standard applicable to public forums.
18

The test to be used in determining whether

1.9 such a conversion has taken place was also set forth in
20 the Greenburgh
21

case.

If the facilities have been

preserved for the use to which they are lawfully

22 dedicated or preserved for their normal and intended
23 function, the property remains a nonpublic forum.

If on

24 the other hand the facilities have been opened up for
25 more general

use, they may become a public forum for

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 certain groups or for certain purposes.
2

To apply this test here, the threshold

3 question is to identify the uses for which the school
4 mail facilities are lawfully dedicated.
5

QUESTION:

Speaking of threshold questions,

6 counsel, at some point I hope you're going to address
7 the jurisdiction question.

But you do it in your own

8 time.
9

MR. CHANIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, it was not my

10 intention to address it in oral argument.

We believe

11 that the point is clear and we have addressed it rather
12 completely in our reply brief, and unless there are
13 questions we're prepared to rely on the reply brief.
14

Phrased otherwise, the question we must look

15 at it, what is the normal and intended function of these
16 school mail facilities.

The Appellees point out that

17 they are basically a communication medium and what they
18 seek to do is communicate, and therefore they are within
19 the normal and intended function.
20

We submit that is far too broad a

21 formulation.

The function must be more narrowly defined

22 if it is to have any meaning.

The normal and intended

23 function of a school mail facility is not to carry
24 information by anyone, about any subject.

The normal

25 and intended function, as both of the lower courts

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

recognized, and indeed as Appellees concede in their

2 briefs,

is to communicate to the teachers information

3 that involves school business.

That is the normal and

4 intended function.

So we must look in this case as to what does

5

6 the phrase "school business" mean.
7

And in the context

that we have before us, it derives meaning from two

8 sources.

The first is the inherent function of any

9 school district to educate children.

This function

10 would embrace any communications that the school
11

district reasonably concludes are supportive of that

12 mission, that are of relevance and educational interest
13 to

the students.

14

Eut there is in this case a second source from

15 which the phrase
16 that is

"school business" derives meaning, and

the Indiana labor relations statute, more

17 specifically the representational duty that that statute
18 imposes upon

the union that is designated as the

19 exclusive representative and which requires it

to have

20 an effective method for communicating with the members

21 of the bargaining unit that it is both authorized and
22 obligated to represent.
23

The Appellees admit, as does the court below,

24 that PEA has legal
25 the bargaining

obligations vis a vis the members of

unit that it does not have.

1

QUESTION;

Mr. Chanin, what does the record

2 show here was the use by others of the mail facilities?

MR. CHANIN;

3

What the record shows, Justice,

4

is that subsequent to the designation of PEA as the

5

exclusive representative in 1977 the mail facilities

6 have been used by PEA in its representational capacity
7

and by the YMCA, the YWCA, the Cub Scouts and certain

8 parochial schools, all organizations which we submit are
9

on their face youth-oriented civil organizations which

10

are engaged in activities that would be of interest and

11

educational relevance to students.
QUESTION;

12

Does the record tell us any more

13

about the specific uses than simply the identity of the

14

users?

15

MR. CHANIN:

No, the record indeed says

16

nothing about the specific uses by PEA or by any of the

17

other groups.

18

access, and the only groups that have had post-1977

19

access are the civic youth groups I’ve identified.

20
21

It merely identifies those who have had

QUESTION:

Is it possible to say, Mr. Chanin,

whether any group besides -- is it the PLEA is your

22 group's rival?
23

MR. CHANIN;

24

QUESTION:

25

It is our rival.
Yeah.

Were affirmatively excluded

in the sense of having sought access and been denied

1

it?
MR. CHASINi

2
3

indicata that.

4
5

There is nothing in the record to

QUESTION;

Does that lead to — can you then

generalize as to what the school district's standard for

6 access to these mailboxes was, or are you left pretty
7

much to having several points and trying to figure out

8 where the line goes?

HR. CHANINs

9

Oh, no, we have no trouble

10

whatsoever identifying the standard.

11

standard is that the school mail facilities since 1977

12

have been limited to communications dealing with school

13

business.

14

wish to communicate about their youth-oriented

15

activities and programs is school business, and we think

16

that an fleeted exclusive representative with statutory

17

obligations toward the teachers is also school

18

business.

19

We think the

And we think that youth organizations that

The record indicates no other use post-1977,

20 and we think the standard is clear.
21

QUESTIOSi

Can you give us some examples of

22 communications from your client to the teachers that
23
24
25

would be school business as you describe it?
HR. CHANIN:

Not from the record. Justice

Stevens, but I can tell you what this union and other

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

anions typically include in their communications.

They

2 send information about the implementation of the
3 collective bargaining agreement, about the settlement
4 and disposition of grievances, about working conditions
5 that they are dealing with the school board about.

QUESTIONi

6

And what a stinker the other union

7 is.
8

MR. CHANINi

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Pardon me, sir?
And what a stinker -the competing

union is.
MR. CHANIN:

I think that may come in

12

occasionally.

But certainly that is not the purpose for

13

which they were granted use.

The purpose for which they

14 were granted use is to perform their functions as a
15 representative of all of the teachers.
16

From this record there is nothing to suggest

17 that they did anything but that.

The contract

18 specifically limits their use to that function.
19 is nothing in the record to rebut that.

There

It seems to us

20 that if there were evidence to suggest -21

QUESTION:

Just taking one of your examples,

22 describing the result of a particular grievance between
23 one union member and the school board, I assume, why
24 would that be disseminated to the entire union
25 membership?

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. CHANIN;

Because the resolution of the

2 grievance -3

QUESTION;

4

they've been doing?

5

To tell them what a fine job

HR. CHANINs

The resolution of a grievance

6 that arises under a collective bargaining agreement does
7

not have one-on-one impact.

«hat it will usually turn

8 on is the interpretation of a phrase or a provision in a
9
10
11

collective agreement which has widespread impact on the
entire bargaining unit.
We think this Court has recognized on numerous

12

occasions that at the very least, and we believe it's

13

probably broader than that, the legitimate functions of

14

a representative organization are collective bargaining,

15

contract negotiation, and contract administration.

16

QUESTION*

What would happen if Congress

17

passed a law which said that the NEA shall have the

18

authority to send its mail with a frank on it and denied

19

that to all other organizations?

20

HR. CHANIN:

I think that law would be

21

unconstitutional, Your Honor.

22

QUESTIONS

23

MR. CHANINs

And the difference is what?
The NEA does not hold in that

24

context this special status vis a vis the constituency

25

to who that franked mail would go.

What we have here is

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a union, the PEA, which was not chosen for unreasonable

2 or arbitrary reasons to have this access privilege.

It

3

competed under a state law, under the principle of

4

exclusive recognition, and it won.

5

that it has been given access which has been denied to

And the only reason

6 other unions is because it won.

How, the PLEA will have an opportunity at an

7

8 appropriate time under the Indiana statute to challenge
9

the PEA.

And if it wins and becomes the exclusive

10

representative, it will have those legal obligations and

11

we assume that it will have the access privilege.
QUESTION;

12
13

it?

14

doesn't.

One of them has free access and the other one

MR. CHANIN;

15
16

Well, it'll be a fair fight, won't

Honor.

That is not the fact, Your

The Indiana law makes it clear —

17

QUESTION;

I'm not talking about Indiana law.

18

MR. CHANIN;

19

in on the fight, sir.

Well, I would like to just focus
When that fight takes place --

20 and by "fight" I mean the representation election -21

then both organizations that compete are guaranteed

22 equal access to all communications facilities.
23
24
25

QUESTION;

Does that give them the right to

use those boxes?
MR. CHANIN;

They will be during the

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 representation campaign.
2

QUESTION:

Now where'd I get that from?

3

MR. CHANIN:

4

QUESTION:

That’s in the record.
Where?

In 197 —

Where is that in the

5 record?
6

MR. CHANIN:

It is in the request for

7 admissions, the responses.

It is also in the affidavit

8 submitted by the school board, and it’s also a matter of
9 Inliana law established in the Pike decision, which is
10 attached in our jurisdictional statement.
11

The law in Indiana is that exclusive

12 privileges of access are available only during the
13 insulation period.

The insulation period is after a

14 union has won the election and until it may be
15 challenged under state law.

In most cases that is for

16 two years.
17

In the election that took place in *77 there

18 was equal access, and if there is another election there
19 will be equal access again.
20

QUESTION:

Mr. Chanin, state law just allows

21 it?
22

MR. CHANIN:

23

QUESTION:

State law requires equal access.
Yes, but during the insulation

24 period state law doesn’t require unilateral access.
25 Only it simply permits it to be bargained.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. CHANIN;

That is corrsct, it allows it as

2 a bargainable matter.

QUESTION;

3
4

I sure wish you could point that

out in the record, or do I have to go look for it?

5

MR. CHANIN;

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. CHANIN;

I can point it point.
Okay, I'll find it, if it's there.
Let me, if I may, get back to the

8 point
9

QUESTION:

While you've been interrupted

10

already, just to clarify, is the school board a party or

11

was it a party below?

12

MR. CHANIN;

The school board was a party in

13

the district court and the Court of Appeals.

14

joined in the appeal to this Court.

15
16

QUESTION;

Does the school board have any

interest in your prevailing?

17

MR. CHANIN;

18

QUESTION;

19

20
21

It has not

I'm sure it does.
What is the interest of the school

board that's at stake?
MR. CHANIN;

We would like to believe that its

interests are that we prevail, that what we are seeking

22 here is to sustain a provision which we believe and
23

which this Court has indicated contributes to labor

24

peace, to labor stability, and to a more rational

25

relationship.

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

But the provision in dispute was

2 adopted by the board at the request of your client, was
3 it not?
4

MR, CHANIN:

It was adopted through collective

5 bargaining, in the give and take of collective
6 bargaining.

7

QUESTION;

8 the union not been

And is there any reason why, had
interested in preventing your rival

9 union from having access,

is there any reason to believe

10 that the school board independently would have concluded
11

that this was a desirable provision?

And if so, what

12 reason would motivate it?

13

MR. CHANIN;

I think there is reason to

14 conclude that, although I can't look into the mind of
15 this school board.

I might suggest that Congress has

16 concluded that it is a good thing to limit it to the
17 exclusive representative and has built that into the law
18 governing labor relations of federal employees.
19 Civil Service Reform Act in 1978,
20 Rehnquist's question,
21

The new

picking up on Justice

does not merely authorize

preferential access, it mandates it.

It makes it an

22 unfair labor practice to allow a minority union to use
23 federal government facilities when there is a recognized
24 organization .
25

So I think, at least as a general answer, here

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is a presumably objective body, the United States

2 Congress, which concluded that that contributes to a
3 more stable system of labor relations.
4

QUESTION:

Well, even if the school board

5 weren't all that happy to have either union in there, I
6 suppose it has some interest in keeping use of the
7 teachers' mailboxes by outside groups at a minimum.
8 have forced

You

it in effect to give you access, but perhaps

9 it would just as soon limit it as much as it could.
10
11

MR. CHANIN;

I expect that's true.

forced it, I think, in two ways;

We have

through collective

12 bargaining and because we presumably persuaded it that
13 we have legal obligations which this enable us to
14 perform more effectively.
15

QUESTION:

In the course of the bargaining and

16 in the development of this rule,

was your claim in the

17 bargaining, your demand, that your organization have
18 access and your rival organization not have access, or
19 simply that your organization have access
20
21

MR. CHANIN;

I only know, Your Honor, and the

record only indicates what came out of the bargaining.

22 What came out of the bargaining was the double-sided
23 limitation.
24

QUESTION;

The exclusive access.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. ZWEIG, Esq., ON BEHALF

6

OF APPELLEES, PERRY LOCAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION
MR. ZWEIG;

7

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and

8 may it please the Courts

This case raises the question of the

9

10 constitutionality of a collective bargaining agreement
11

between a teachers union and a school district which

12 grants the teachers union exclusive access to

the

13 school’s internal mail system and compels the school
14 district to deny that right to another teacher
15 organization, while at the same time the school district
16 is permitted and in fact does allow numerous other
17 organizations and individuals to use that system for
18 whatever purpose they deem appropriate.

The Metropolitan School District of Perry

19

20 Township consists of
21

13 schools, and in each school

there is a set of mailboxes which has a teacher's name

22 written above them.

This internal mail system and the

23 mailboxes which are part of it has been in place for a
24 number of years, and for a number of years outside
25 groups,

individual teachers, the Perry Education

Association, and the Appellee here. Perry Local

2 Educators'

Association were granted simultaneous and

3 equal access to those facilities.

QUESTION:

4

Are you going to leave the issue of

5 jurisdiction to your brief,

HE. ZWEIG;

6

7 question of

as your adversary has?

I would be glad to comment on the

jurisdiction.

8

QUESTION;

I wish you would.

9

MR. ZWEIG:

The Perry Education Association

10 has attempted to invoke this Court's appellate
11

jurisdiction on the basis of 28 United States Code

12 Section

1254.

They state that the Court of Appeals for

13 the Seventh Circuit held an

Indiana statute in essence

14 to be unconstitutional.
15

In point of fact, what the Court of Appeals

16 held was a paragraph in a collective bargaining
17 agreement between the school district and Perry
18 Education Association violated
19 Educators*
20 Amendment.

the Perry Local

Association's rights under the First
Indiana law does not treat that contract as

21 either an ordinance or a statute.

Rather, it treats it

22 simply as a contract.
23

Indeed, Indiana law limits those bodies which

24 are permitted to enact statutes or ordinances.

Those

25 limitations are placed by the Indiana General Assembly

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and the Indiana Constitution, and nowhere is a school

2 district given the authority to adopt an ordinance.
3

QUESTION;

Supposing an Indiana school

4

district adopted, outside of the labor context, a

5

regulation saying that no black armbands shall be worn

6 in the school by the students.
7

8
9

Would you say that was

not appealable here under the same circumstances?
MR. ZWEIG:

We would say that is appealable,

because that would be a unilateral action by the school

10

district, as opposed to something that was the result of

11

a collective bargaining process.

12

QUESTION;

But supposing the school district

13

held intense hearings and heard all sorts of groups on

14

this black armband guestion, and one group demanded one

15

thing and one demanded another thing, and the school

16

board finally came out and said, this is the way we

17

resolve it.

18

mean, it*s the school board that finally grants the

19

access, not the union.

Is that all that different from this?

20

MR. ZWEIG;

21

different situation.

I

We would say that that is a
The situation which you posit we

22 believe is more synonymous with what happens in the
23

legislative process generally, where hearings are held

24

on bills that are presented both to Congress and to

25

state legislatures, and ultimately it's the legislature

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that adopts that ordinance unilaterally or that statute

2 unilaterally.
3

And that's not the case in this instance,

4 where you have one party negotiating with another party
5 and the result of that is a contract.

And indeed, we

6 think that the case centrally relied upon by the
7 Appellants,

the King Manufacturing case, does make that

8 distinction.

That case talks about what a statute is

9 and what it declares is that a statute is a

unilateral

10 enactment by the legislative body.
11

QUESTION:

12

MB. ZWEIG:

How was the contract approved?
It was approved at an open school

13 board meeting.
14

QUESTION:

So it took a legislative act to

15 approve it?
16

MR. ZWEIG:

In one sense of the word it was a

17 legislative act.
18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ZWEIG:

Well, it was, wasn't it?
Except that under Indiana law that

20 wouldn't be considered to be a

21

legislative act.

It is

the result of a collective bargaining process which

22 requires adoption by the school board.
23 it would be a legislative enactment.

To that extent
But we think there

24 is a difference.
25

QUESTION:

What if the school board in advance

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 negotiators are authorized to agree to an exclusive use

provision in the contract?

appropriate process and so on and that was a regulation

MR. ZWEIGs

10
11

12

Do you think that would

That might be a legislative

enactment.
QUESTION;

Well, do you think it's different,

13

do you think it's different if after the fact the school

14

board approves it?

15

MR. ZWEIGs

16

QUESTIONS

17

MR. ZWEIGs

We do think it's different.
How?

Why?

We think it's different because it

18

is the culmination of a process where two parties are

19

negotiating over a point.

It is different than a

20 legislative enactment where there is a lot of debate and
21

ultimately it’s only the legislators who have the

22 authority to pass the statute or the ordinance.
23

QUESTION:

But is the process any different in

24

the advance authorization than in the subsequent

25

ratification ?

great in the collective bargaining process, probably,

8 than in the legislative enactment process.

QUESTION:

9
10

In terms of the substantive issues presented

3 by this case,

5

Yes, under either form.

1

QUESTION:

Well, if it is, it certainly is a

2 Congressional declaration.
3

SR. ZWEIG:

Yes.

Yes, sir.

4

The basic point of departure for the decision

5 before this Court is whether or not that internal mail

6 system which was established by the Perry Township
7 School Board is a limited

public forum, and this Court

8 has set out what the test is for a limited public forum
9 or a public forum generally.
10 where the Court said
11

That's set out in Grayned,

that we must inquire as to whether

the manner of expression is basically incompatible with

12 the normal activity of

a particular place at a

13 particular time.

The school board in this case has already

14
15 determined

that PLEA's use of that system -- PEA's use

16 of that system, before
17 compatible with the

1978 in any event — was

uses for which that system

18 originally was developed, and that is to facilitate
19 communication between teachers.
20
21

Furthermore, this Court in Tinker implicitly
acknowledged a public school is a form of a public

22 forum, not in the sense of the national mall, not in the
23 sense of the streets and the parks, but for certain
24 purposes it is a limited public forum;

and that speech

25 within that forum can be limited by the state only

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

insofar as it will materially and substantially disrupt

2 the education of students and the system generally.

QUESTION;

3

Sometimes schools allow political

4

candidates to come and make speeches in the evening in

5

many states.

Do you think when they do that they must

6 either let all candidates come or not permit any to
7

come?
HR. ZWEIG;

8
9

I think that a school district

which allowed, for example, the Democrats to come in and

10

speak to the teachers would be hard-pressed to deny any

11

other political gcoup access to those, to the facilities

12

for the purposes of —

QUESTION;

16

Do you say, Hr. Zweig, that your

17

case depends on our agreeing with you that this is a

18

limited public forum?
MR. ZWEIG;

19

Suppose we don’t?
We don't believe it's essential

20 that the Court determine that it is a limited public
21

forum.

As the Court in Bellotti held, even where there

22 is not a public forum, that unless there's a compelling
23

state interest in limiting a particular speaker to

24

speech, that a state has no business silencing a

25

particular speaker on any particular issue.

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And in this case there are no compelling state

1

2 interests which have been proven or even suggested by
3 the Appellant or the school district.

QUESTION;

4

Well, I thought what they suggest

5 was that this is in the interest of labor peace.
6

MR. ZWEIG:

They suggested that -That's certainly a state interest,

MR. ZWEIG;

11

It certainly is, Mr. Justice

But they suggested that only in the courts
They have not reasserted that here, and

12 presumably the reason they haven't reasserted it here is
13 that at no time from

1973 forward, when PEA first became

14 the exclusive bargaining representative, has there been
15 any incident of labor disharmony or strife between PLEA
16 and PEA.

There's just no evidence of that whatsoever.

17

The second --

18

QUESTION:

Well, the federal contract bar rule

19 for a period of whatever it is now is certainly imposed
20 just across the board, without regard to whether there
21

might be disharmony or friction in that particular

22 employment situation.

Do you think that the state or

23 the school board in this case would be unjustified in
24 saying,

we're not going to look into individual examples

25 of whether or not there's harmony or disharmony, we just

1

think, this is a good policy and we're going to adhere to

2 it?

MR. ZWEIG:

3

I think the school board and the

4

state -- strike that.

Just the state can make the

5

determination that a two-year period where there will

6 not be permitted any challenge to the exclusive
7

bargaining status of a group, is a legitimate state

8 interest and maybe compelling.
9

It offers the

opportunity to allow the majority union to solidify its

MR, ZWEIG;

2

We don't believe that it would,

and we base that upon the facts of this case.

Prior to

4

the time that this exclusive access policy was enacted,

5

both PEA and PLEA had access to that system.

And during

6 that time there was no incident of labor strife.

We do not believe that there is any basis in

disharmony or strife.

have, because after all, as this Court has held in

Indeed, under Indiana law — and I'd refer the

There are a number of items in there

11

issues, such as budget appropriations, such as class

12

size, such as selection, assignment and promotion of

13

personnel, are largely political questions.

14

And what the school board has done by adopting

15

this restrictive access policy has been to give one side

public questions a much better

than another organization.

QUESTION:

When is that critical period of

11 time?
12

MR. ZWEIG:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. ZWEIG:

Early on during the school year.
Why is that critical?
Because when new teachers come in

15 we would like to have the opportunity to speak with
16 them, to talk about the issues which are presented to
17 the school system?
18

QUESTION:

19

HR. ZWEIG:

To kind of organize them in a way?
In a way, to at least give a

20 contrary point of view to that being expressed by the
21 majority union.
22

So we can't use the United States mail system

23 effectively before that list is given to us, whereas PEA
24 can immediately begin to transmit its messages the day
25 that the school doors open.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

Secondly, we think, that there is a much

2 greater burden placed upon our exercise of free speech
3

than that being placed on PEA by virtue of the fact that

4

we will have to pay 20 cants a letter and they will have

5

to pay nothing, and in addition to that will be able to

6 use school personnel to get those messages to the
7

teachers.
QUESTION;

8
9

Mr. Zweig, in the USPS versus

Council of Greenburgh case, the Court held that the

10

United States mail system did not require us to have a

11

compelling state interest test applied to any

12

restrictions placed on the use of the U.S. mails.

13

is the mail service of the school district any

14

different?

15

MR. ZWEIG;

Why

We think it's different because

16

the private mailboxes which each of us has in our home

17

are not, in terms of the court, a public forum.

18

difference is that in that instance nobody else is

19

granted access to those mailboxes except for the United

20 States Postal Service.
21

And the

In that instance the Postal

Service does not allow the Democrats to use the system,

22 the mailboxes, or the YMCA's or the parochial schools or
23
24
25

anything like that, as we have here.
And what the Court said in that case is that
they had no occasion to be concerned about that because

39

it was an equal exclusion of all people from the system,

whereas in this case it is a very selective exclusion of

people from the system.

Did I understand you to say that if

to deny both unions access to this?

deny both.

Given the entrance of other

people, other outside organizations and individuals to

the system, based on that we would say we should have

the same access.
QUESTION;

13

So that what you're saying is if

MR. ZWEIG;

No.

MR. ZHEIG;

QUESTION;

Yes.
Are you arguing separately, as I

Greenberg case

2

QUESTION;

Greenberg, yes.

3

MR. ZWEIG;

The Court made a strong point of

4

the fact that the mailboxes there and generally in the

5

country are not open to selected groups to use; that is

6 to say, the Postal Service doesn't attempt to
7

distinguish between individuals and organizations who

8 may gain access to their private box and exclude some
9

and grant access to others.
So we don't believe that the Greenberg

10
11

decision is in any way contrary to the position that

12 we're asserting in this case.

QUESTION;

13

Counsel, I understood you to say

14

earlier that you perceive this to be a limited public

15

forum.

16

Are you claiming it's a limited one or an unlimited

It's certainly not the classical public forum.

This is not like a street.

It is not even like the university

QUESTION:

But there were-over a hundred

4 organizations allowed to use the building in that case.

MR. ZWEIG:

5

But in this case there is no

6 evidence that anybody other than PLEA has been

7 excluded.

That is the only group that’s been excluded.

8 Other groups have been granted access,

and the school

9 system has adopted no rules —

QUESTION;

10
11

"excluded."

Has any other one asked to be?

MR. ZWEIG:

12

Well, you have to be careful with

We are not familiar with any group

13 which has asked to gain entrance -14

QUESTIONS

Well, that doesn't mean excluded,

15 does it?

You have to first ask in order to use the word

16 "excluded."

MR. ZWEIG*

17

During the course of the

18 proceedings in the trial court we attempted through
19 discovery to determine who had been granted access and
20 who had been denied access and a number of other issues;
21

but our discovery was cut off on a motion filed by the

22 appellants in this case, and so we didn't have an
23 opportunity to develop that particular point.
24

QUESTION:

Did you win or lose in the district

25 court ?

on that.

Yes, we did.
Did the Court of Appeals pass on it?
No, it did not.

It did not rule

It determined that the facts were sufficient

8 to show a clear First and Fourteenth Amendment violation.
9

QUESTION:

You really couldn’t urge that as an

10

alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the

11

Court of Appeals, I suppose, because if it were found

12

that the. discovery were inadequate, it wouldn't be an

13

affirmance, and the judge would send it back —

14

MR. ZWEIG:

That’s correct.

The point is that

15

PEA has complained that we haven’t shown a number of

16

facts, but the stark reality is that we were prevented

17

from showing thosa facts by virtua of tha procaedings in

18

tha district court.

19

Because the speech which is within the school

20 district is,
21

in our view, inherently political, we

believe that it is an error as a matter of law for the

22 school district to exclude one side of those political
23
24
25

views and allow another side in.
Row, the appellants in this case also have
claimed that because of the alternative channels of

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

communication available to us that our First Amendment

2 right is in essence de minimis, and in that sense they
3

followed Memphis, AFT and Connecticut, AFT cases, the

4

Second and Sixth Circuit cases.
But the only opportunity to get to that issue

5

6 is if it is shown that the restriction here is a
7

reasonable time, place and manner restriction.

And it's

8 our suggestion that the restriction here is not that
9 because it is content- and

10 therefore,

11

viewpoint-based, and it is,

under the control and precedents of this

Court per se, unreasonable.
Additionally, the alternative channels of

12
13

communication alleged to be available to us are really

14

not very availing and they're not equally effective.

15

They suggest that we can use the intercom system, but

16

that is available only when school was out and the

17

teachers are dispersed to the various activities or to

18 their home.

They suggest that we can use the bulletin

19

20 boards, but in
21

point of fact the record shows there’s

only one bulletin board, and that's at the Burkhardt

22 School in all of the Perry Township schools.
23 suggest that

we can use the meeting rooms.

24 that that’s not a very
