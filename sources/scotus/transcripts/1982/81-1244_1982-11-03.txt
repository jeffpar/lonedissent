ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL L. 3OIC0URT, ESQ.*

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. 30IC0URT:

8
9

We will hear arguments

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

may it please the Court, as oral argument is presented

10

in this case today, the litigation is in its tenth

11

year.

12

this Court is one involving the attorneys' fees awarded

13

by the district court and affirmed by the court of

14

appeals.

15

application of the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards

16

Act of 1976, Title 42, Section 1983.

The only issue remaining for resolution before

The case will require an interprstation and

17

On behalf of Petitioners, I urge the Court to

18

adopt the principle that award of attorneys' fees under

19

the statute should fairly and accurately reflect the

20

extent to which a plaintiff has prevailed on the

21

suostantial claims in his case.

22

accept the principle that the Attorneys' Fees Award Act

23

does not compensate a plaintiff in a civil rights case

24

for his failures, and it does not penalize a defendant

25

in a civil rights case for his substantial successes.

I ask the Court to

1

On the facts, the district court acorovea in

2

this case an attorneys' f9e award of over $133,000.

3

That represented 2,357 principal hours as found by the

4

trial court.

by the court of appeals.

district court to proportion the fee to reflect the

7

extent to which the plaintiff succeeded on claims and

8

the extent to which the defendants successfully

9

defended, in effect, demonstrating that no

Again, that award was affirmed per curium
No attempt was made by the

10

constitutional deprivation had occurred with respect to

11

certain claims in the lawsuit.

12

The district court itself found in its opinion

13

relating to fees that the defendants did prevail on some

14

of the issues.

15

effect fees for every hour spent by plaintiff's

16

attorneys on the case without respect to whether they

17

prevailed or lost on specific issues.

Nevertheless, it awarded in practical

This case involved a comprehensive —

MR. 3QICCURT:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think there

22

were a few claims in this case that because they were

23

not abandoned orior to trial had become close to being

24

frivolous by being presented in the courtroom.

25

were other claims in the case which were unsuccessful

Would you give me an example of

those you regarded as frivolous?

7

MR. 3CICGURT:

Yes* Your Honor.

I think by

8

the time they got to the point in the lawsuit where they

9

were trying to prove that defendants overrelied upon

10

medication in controlling the patients in the forensic

11

unit* that had become frivolous* because their own

12

experts*

13

years in advance of the case, did not support the

14

claim.

15

there was no evidence of overmedication of patients.

16

think their failure to abandon that was frivolous.

They all came to the courtroom and testified

QUESTION:

MR. 30IC0URT:

I

Any other claims besides that one?
I think with respect to the

19

mail policy, the fact that the mail policy of the

20

forensic unit was amended in 1977 — That was during the

21

duration of the lawsuit.

contemporary Eighth Circuit precedent which dealt with

attorneys and an opportunity to review the work of both

3

MR. 30ICCURT:

I think he looked pretty

4

closely to the records» Your Honor» but it mas in the

5

context of his attempting to folloui a previous Eighth

6

Circuit precedent which he believed foreclosed him from

7

reducing the fee because of unsuccessful claims.

8

think that was more addressed to the matter of

9

duplication of effort among counsel.

Does he say that he didn't think he

had the authority to reduce it?

Is there anything in his

Well» I think when he addressed

18

that issue he cited directly language from opinions out

19

of the Eighth Circuit* and somewhat dissimilar cases»

20

but the language clearly indicated a position of the

21

Eighth Circuit that all hours were to be compensated»

22

and I believe that the opinion read as a whole indicates

23

that he was following that precedent.

QUESTION:

I have read it* and I just didn't

MR. BOICCURTi

5

I don't think that's a

I think it's a fair reading in

6

this regard» Your honor.

What the judge did» it is very

7

clear from the entire record of this case that there

8

were failures» substantial failures on behalf of

9

plaintiff's attorneys» but once that one reduction u/as

10

made for one attorney who was inexperienced» ail hours

11

claimed, every hour claimed that was requested was

12

compensated, and he made no attempt to demonstrate that

13

in any way the extent to which successful claims on

14

behalf of defendants should have been taken into

15

account.

16

presented to him, I think, because of the Eighth Circuit

17

precedent which he followed.

QUESTION:

He in effect rejected the theory which I

Is there any — What is the Eighth

19

Circuit precedent that most clearly states what you say

20

their view of the law is on this?

21

MR. 30ICGURT:

The most clear Eighth Circuit

22

precedent is Brown versus Bathke, which involves what I

23

think creates a distinction which should be made.

24

versus Bathke has language of apparently very adverse

25

character to our position, but it involved an

QUESTION;

Right.

I think you'd have a

stronger — I would understand that as a stronger — but

6

does he cite that case, the district judge?

7

MR. 3CICGURT:

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. 80IC0URT;

Yes, sir.

Yes, he dees, I see, on Page A-ll.
Again with respect to the

10

issues which ware litigated in the case, pursuant to

11

local rules, counsel on the morning the trial of this

12

case began agreed there were 24 issues, substantial

13

claims which remained to be litigated in the case.

14

will freely admit with respect to some of those 24

15

claims that they were related, cannot be substantially

16

distinguished.

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. 3QIC0URT;

19

QUESTION;

I

Mr. Soicourt —
Yes, Your Honor.

— should we really look, though,

20

at the ultimate relief sought in the broad terms of the

21

complaint, or at a pretrial order list of issues in

22

seeing if the attorneys' fees allowed were reasonable?

23

MR. 30ICCURT;

What I was attempting to do,

24

Your Honor, is demonstrate — I think on the face of the

25

opinion of the court on the merits, the district court,

11

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it is clsar that there mere some substantial failures.

2

It is made even more clear by the pretrial order filed

3

on the day before the case began, because in many

4

instances the court did not take up or consider its

5

opinion on the merits. Certain claims uihich were made

6

and proof mere offered on those claims at trial, and the

7

court just ignored them in its opinion.

8

demonstrates the plaintiffs failed to prevail on those

9

particular claims and that their time should be

I think that

discounted.
Noui, mith respect to these 24 claims,

11

and

12

again, some of them mere related, most of them, I

13

submit, mere not, the court ordered relief on six.

14

believe that each of these claims or the vast majority

15

of these claims mere truly separable, fractionable,

16

they mould have served as an independent basis for a

17

one-issue lamsuit.

18

have been an unsuccessful one-issue lamsuit, and no

19

attorneys' fees under any interpretation of the statute

20

can be amarded to a party mho does not prevail at all.

2

counsel for substantiating that claim.

3

question that the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Award Act

4

was intended as an inducement to civil rights litigation.

5

There is no

I assume that my opponent will argue at great

6

length this afternoon that the theory that the

7

Petitioners espouse would deter civil rights litigation»

8

but the Awards Act, the Fees Act will encourage exactly

9

that kind of litigation which it rewards.

10

If the merit of a claim is not going to be the

11

key factor in a judicial determination as to whether

12

fees should be rewarded — awarded for time spent

13

establishing that claim, then I submit to you that the

14

merit of the claim will not be the key factor in the

15

decision of counsel whether to include that claim in his

16

original litigation or whether to abandon that claim in

17

an attempt to narrow the scope of his lawsuit before it

18

comes to trial.

19

As a result —

20

QUESTION:

Do you think that the statute

21

prohibits giving attorneys' fees for the so-called

22

catalytic results if the lawsuit is filed and relates to

23

several claims, and before it comes to trial th9

24

defendants change the practice, and it isn't necessary

25

to go to trial on it?

Under the statute, can attorneys'

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

fees be secured for those results?
MR. 30ICCURT:

2

Yes» I believe they can» Your

3

Honor.

If the burden of proof is carried by plaintiff's

4

counsel and his lawsuit that has served as a catalyst to

5

voluntary action by defendants, I think the time

6

reasonably expended to accomplish that voluntary action

7

should be compensated, but only that time reasonably

8

expended up until the voluntary action took place.

9

he continues to litigate that claim after the voluntary

If

10

action and up through the end of trial, the end of the

11

litigation, the time after that voluntary action takes

12

place should not be compensated.

13

I submit that the rule in the Eighth Circuit

14

which in effect results in all hours being compensated

15

regardless of the relative success of the parties in the

16

various claims at issue would and does create an

17

imposition on the courts.

18

pleading and congested court dockets.

19

important functions of a district court judge is to

20

narrow the scope of litigation in front of him, to get

21

the parties to agree to make the case as workable and as

22

presentable in the courtroom as is possible.

23

It must encourage frivolous
One of the most

There is no incentive for a civil rights

I think that frustrates the ability of the trial

Is there anything in this judge's

opinion that said ha paid him for working on frivolous

matters?

13

MR. 3QICCURT:

No, there is nothing in the

decision of the judge that says that.
QUESTION:

Well, where do you get your basis

for your argument?
MR. 30IC0URT;

I suggest to the Court that

14

there were some issues that at the time of trial had

15

become frivolous.

16

because issues are not frivolous,

17

that would change my oosition,

18

provides for compensation for prevailing, for winning.

19

Even if the issues ware not frivolous, were substantial,

20

but he lost, he still should not be paid for his time

expect the trial judge to say that.

to be reversed.

Can anyone looking at the record of

the time identify accurately the items for uihich you say

MR. 3GICQURT;

10

I think in this particular case

11

because time records were not kept which were in any way

12

related to various claims of the course of the lawsuit*

13

it would be difficult for anyone to do that except the

14

trial judge.

what a reasonable fee should be in the case» or

16

determine how many issues I won and how many issues my

21

That is why I don't ask this Court to find

Has the issue come up in other

circuits ?
MR. 3CIC0URT:

23

That is one reason why I think it is very important that

24

some position be taken by this Court.

25

QUESTION:

What have other circuits said?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. 3QIC0URT;

1

Well, that's interesting.

2

Including the Eighth Circuit, the Fifth and Sixth

3

Circuits have a line of cases with language very similar

4

to the Eighth Circuit, contrary to my position.

5

respect to four circuits, different panels within the

6

circuit have disagreed on the issue on their face, tout

7

within the circuit there are conflicts.
With respect to the District of Columbia

8

9

Circuit and four others, the cases support my position.

10

This is a classic example of a true split in the

11

circuits.

QUESTION:

14

15

With

So there are express examples of
sorting the case out as between what

MR. 30ICOURT:

Yes, Your Honor.

The

16

preponderance of the total number of cases support my

17

position, that attorneys' fees are not to be awarded for

18

has found that Congress intended to penalize defendants

In addition*

I think that was the purpose of Congress in

Court's holding in Alyeska that the circumstances under

Congress accompanied this statute

In the

Congress — In the legislative history,

Congress anticipated a numoer of issues which would

guidance for resolution of those issues.

of the legislative history which addresses the method of

computing the amount of the fee, Congress explicitly

stated what the proper standard was to be
"In corouting the fee* counsel for the

2

3

prevailing party should be compensated* as is

4

traditional with attorneys for fee-paying clients* for

5

all time reasonably expended on a matter."
Congress provided further direction on this

6

7

issue by stating that proper fee computation had taken

8

place in ttuo specific cases* the Davis versus County of

9

Los Angeles case and the Stanford Daily versus Zirker

10

case.

Those cases established that the all time

11

reasonably expended standard does not permit

12

apportioning the fee award to only winning claims.
In the Davis case* which was a Title 7 suit,

13
14

defendants had argued for a proportional fee reduction.

15

The court specifically held it was not legally relevant

16

that a certain amount of limited time and effort was

devoted to. issues which were either not litigated or

18

upon which they were not successful.

looked to the ultimate results achieved, and found that

that —
QUESTION:

Do you think it ought to go only

MR. EICHNER:

I believe the district court

found that the reason for not awarding an enhancement

the Johnson factors which go to enhancement were already
taken into account in the reasonable fees» so that there
was no reason to repeat those same factors and award
upwards.

You would never discount.

While you are thinking about that* let me ask

Suppose after you brought this lawsuit, you

had so impressed counsel for the hospital that they

1

agreed to everything you requested before you had even

2

taken discovery depositions* and you had only recorded

3

50 hours of time.

4

you charged $200 an hour.

5

Was that the limit — Would that be the limit of your

6

fee?

7

Would you be entitled to -- Suppose

MR. EICHNER:

That is $10*000* I think.

The limit of the fee would be

8

whatever hourly rate you were asking for for those

number of hours.

10

QUESTION:

Right, that would be $10,000 in

11

this case, and you've won a victory that was probably

12

worth millions of dollars* perhaps?

Well, I come back to the same

point.

I think that the results obtained are one of the

Johnson factors, and the district court considered that,

13

but I think the fee is generally tied to the number of

14

hours.
Congress's citation of the fee computation in

the Davis case and Stanford Daily case endorses a

two-step process for determining reasonable attorneys'

fees.

person is a prevailing party or not, and once they are

20

found to be a prevailing party, the second portion of

21

that two-step process is a look at the case as a whole

22

to see what time was reasonably expended.

23

As I said before, first is whether or not the

Now, legal sources are considered reasonably

25

clearly meritless claims, or devoted to claims so wholly

2

in no may contributed to the ultimate result achieved.

3

The district court's fee analysis in this case is fully

4

consistent mitn the standard provided by the Act and the

5

legislative history.

6

The court analyzed mhether plaintiffs mere a

7

prevailing party, and found that based — looking just

8

at the court order of relief, there mas substantial

9

enough relief to find that plaintiffs mere the

10

prevailing party, so much so that the court did not feel

11

it necessary to look at those issues mhich mere mooted

prior to trial.

13

Secondly —

QUESTION;

Mr. Eichner, can I interrupt you

15

mith a question?

Do you think the standard that the

16

district judge follomed in this case or one mho folloms

17

the 12 Johnson factors is any different from the

18

standard follomed in fixing fees, say, in an antitrust

19

case, or in a trust case, all sorts of cases rnhere

20

courts fix fees?

21

standard, or is this just the regular standard?

Do you think this is a special

MR. EICHNER:

22

I think the process is generally

23

the same.

I think that the civil rights area is special

24

to some extent, because Congress has singled that out as

25

a particularly important place for vigorous enforcement

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of civil rights, and found that tne award of attorneys'

2

fees was particularly tied to the enforcement of civil

3

rights, and therefore directed the courts to use the

4

broadest and most flexible standards to ensure the

5

enforcement of the civil rights.

6

QUESTION:

3 u t do you think that the award

7

given in this case was more liberal than would have been

8

appropriate in any other kind of litigation?

9

MR. cICHNERJ

No, I don't believe that the

10

award in this case was more liberal at all.

11

you were asking whether it is generally the same.

12

QUESTION:

I thought

I frankly don't see much difference

13

between the Johnson factors and factors I run into in

14

countless other situations.

15

MR. EICHNSR:

No, there is — there is a

16

difference of views within the circuits between the

17

so-called Johnson factors and the Loadstar analysis, and

18

various courts have been critical of the Johnson factors

19

because they find them not that precise and hard to work

20

with, and they have gone to a Loadstar analysis.

21

That issue is not pres e.n ted in this case, and

22

regardless of which approach you use, that is, whether

23

you use Johnson or Loadstar, an issue which needs to be

24

determined prior to deciding which approach is going to

25

be the determination of what constitutes compensable

that needs to be -- that's an issue which must be

factors per se.

Defendants had argued for an automatic across

The district court properly rejected those

17

suggestions, finding that such an approach was improper

for a number of reasons, that it was — that is, it was

19

incapable of giving consideration to the relative

With that as a background, let's examine what
