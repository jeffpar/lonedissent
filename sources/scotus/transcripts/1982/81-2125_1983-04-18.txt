PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Geller, I think you may

proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In 1965, Congress passed Title I of the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act for the purpose of expanding and

10

improving programs designed to meet the special educational

11

needs of educational deprived children in low income areas.

12

Congress chose to accomplish this purpose by use

13

of grants of federal funds to state educational agencies or

14

SEA's which in turn would distribute the money to needy local

15

educational agencies or LEA's, generally school districts.

16

The respondents in this case, Pennsylvania and New

17

Jersey, have each received over $1 billion in Title I federal

18

funds since the start of this program.
i

19

Now, in return for obtaining these massive amounts

20

of federal funds, states must agree to abide by certain conditions;

21

written into the Title I statute and regulations.

22

ditions are designed to insure that only eligible children

23

receive Title I services and that Title I funds are not used

24

to provide general aid to schools or to replace state and local

25

funds that would otherwise have been spent for participating

These con­

2

children.
The issue in this case concerns the authority of

3

the Secretary of Education to recoup federal funds paid to

4

the states under the Title I program in instances where the

5

funds were used in violation of the assurances provided by

6

the states when they received the federal money and contrary

7

to the conditions imposed by the statute.

8
9

The facts here can be briefly stated.

-As I noted

a moment ago, the respondents have participated in the Title I

10

program since its inception in 1965.

11

the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which then

12

enforced Title I, performed audits of the New Jersey program

13

for fiscal years 1971 through 1973 and of the Pennsylvania

14

program for fiscal years 1968 through 1973.

In the early 1970's,

15

In the final audit reports, which were issued in

16

1975, HEW found that both states had misapplied significant

17

amounts of Title I funds.

18

that New Jersey and Pennsylvania had improperly approved LEA

19

applications for use of Title I funds in school attendance

20

areas that didn't contain a sufficiently high percentage or

21

number of children from low income families and that in a

22

few instances Title I funds had been spent for general aid

23

purposes rather than targeted to meet the special educational

24

needs of educationally deprived children.

25

Specifically the auditors found

Both states challenged these findings by filing
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

applications for review with the administrative boards set up

2

in HEW to consider Title I claims and after extensive administra­

3

tive hearings, the Educational Appeal Board sustained the auditors'

4

findings in large part and ordered New Jersey to repay about

5

$1 million and Pennsylvania about $400,000.

6

QUESTION:

7

sum was substantially cut down?

8
9

MR. GELLER:

At least with respect to Pennsylvania the

Oh, yes.

The initial audit report was

something like $10 million, I believe, but after Pennsylvania

10

had pursued its rights through the various levels of review,

11

the final recoupment decision was to recoup $422,000 and to

12

pay that money to the Office of Education.

13

To put that into perspective, by the way, Justice

14

Rehnquist, during the period of the audit here, 1968 through

15

1973, for Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania received $365 million

16

in Title I funds.

17

Respondents then sought review of the Education

18

Appeal Board's decision in the Court of Appeals which vacated

19

the Board's decision.

20

lacked statutory authority to order the repayment of this mis­

21

spent funds because the only express authorization to recoup

22

was included in the 1978 amendments to Title I and relying on

23

what the Court of Appeals called the overarching principle

24

of this Court's decision in Pennhurst State School against

25

Halderman; that is that the terms and conditions of a federal

The Third Circuit held that the Secretary

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

grant must be clearly set forth in the statute and regulations

2

authorizing the grant, based on what it called the overarching

3

principle, Pennhurst case.

4

the Secretary could not recoup funds misspent prior to the

5

effective date of the 1978 amendments.

6

QUESTION:

The Court of Appeals found that

Mr. Geller, before you get into your

7

argument, could you help me on one thing?

8

order that was entered by the Secretary here?

9

to pay or an order defining the amount that was due to be paid?

10
11

MR. GELLER:

Was it an order

It was an order essentially defining

the amount that was due to be paid.

12

QUESTION:

13

much should be paid.

14

How do you view the

Because they end us saying this is how

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

The Secretary hasn't yet decided

15

what the most appropriate way would be to collect these monies.

16

Whether if Pennsylvania or New Jersey didn't simply send the

17

check or a portion of the check, a portion of the total amount

18

over several years; whether some sort of administrative recoupment

19

would be feasible.

20

that I think remains to be resolved on remand.

21

22
23
24
25

That question — That is one of the questions

QUESTION:

There really isn't any order outstanding

requiring anybody to pay anybody else any money, is there?
MR. GELLER:

Well, there is an order requiring New

Jersey and Pennsylvania to pay, but the Secretary hasn't yet —
QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said it did not require
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

them to pay.

2

MR. GELLER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GELLER:

Well, it sets the amount and obviously —
It sets the amount, right.
It sets the amount and obviously the

5

Secretary would be most delighted if the states would pay that

6

full amount, but —

7

8

QUESTION:

Well, what happens if they just say, well,

that is very nice, we owe you that money, but —

9

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think that the Secretary would

10

have the authority under the Federal Claims Collection Act either

11

to use administrative offset, if that would be feasible, and we

12

submit that it would be feasible under Title I, or to bring an

13

action in District Court for suit on the prior judgment to

14

recover that amount of money.

15
16

QUESTION:

us now, is that correct?
MR. GELLER:

17
18

That is correct.

This is an appeal

from the administrative determination of liability.

19

20

But, neither of those actions is before

QUESTION:

And surely the Secretary could terminate

the state's participation in the program I suppose?
MR. GELLER:

21

Well, it is not so clear under the

22

statute.

23

if it is currently not in compliance with the statute and not

24

for past non-compliance.

25

The state can only have its application disapproved

QUESTION:

Part of its duty though is to repay and
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

it refuses to repay.

2
3

MR. GELLER:

Well, whether in theory that is a

possibility —

4

QUESTION:

What if the state just says, well, if this

5

is the way you are going to interpret the statute and our

6

agreement, we just want to quit.

7

MR. GELLER:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GELLER:

10

I suppose they could quit.

The states can —
And then the Secretary would have to sue.
Would have to sue because there would

be no offset possible presumably in that situation.

11

QUESTION:

I take it your position is that whether or

12

not — whether or not the states' position is arguable in the

13

sense that arguably and reasonably it might have believed it

14

was not violating the statute; that you have the right to recoup

15

if you decide retrospectively that is what the contract means

16

or that statute means.

17

MR. GELLER:

18

is just a restitution.

19

There are a number of safeguards in the system to make certain

20

that our decision is a correct one.

21

report which the states can challenge and then there is a final

22

audit report which the states can challenge and then there is

23

an appeal to the Education Appeal Board which is a neutral

24

administrative agency composed in large part by non-government

25

personnel.

Well, yes.

This is not a penalty.

This

But, it is not simply our decision.

There is an initial audit

8

2

QUESTION:

Is this the kind of program where the

state initially submits a plan and it is approved?

3

MR. GELLER:

It submits an application simply saying

4

that it will abide by the assurances — It will abide by the

5

conditions in the statute and regulations.

6

in this program comes from the federal government.

7

QUESTION:

All of the money

Another thing, would you think that, to

8

put it crudely, would any fool have known that the state was

9

not in compliance or is it a close case?

10

MR. GELLER:

Is it ia gray area?

Well, in this case particularly I don't

11

think there are any gray areas as to the states' non-compliance.

12

Pennsylvania, for example —

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. GELLER:

So, you say the states should have known.
Well, there are two separate questions

15

here.

16

the statute?

17

right now.

18

Appeals that it had violated the statute.

19

One is should the state have known that it was violating
That is not an issue that is before the Court
Pennsylvania didn't even challenge in the Court of

The issue before this Court is should the states have

20

known that if they were found, after administrative and

21

judicial proceedings, to have violated the statute, should they

22

have known that a remedy that the Secretary could have pursued

23

was to recoup the misspent funds?

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, what if it just so happened that a

majority of the Court thought that if the state should have known
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

why then it should pay the money back?

2

arguable, it may not have ever participate in the program if

3

it had known those were the conditions.

4

of the Court felt that way?

5

MR. GELLER:

But, if it was just

What if the majority

I guess that issue just —

That issue is not — The substantive

6

issue of whether the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania

7

violated the statute is not before the Court.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

I understand that.

In fact —

And, neither is, I

guess, whether or not the states should or should not have
known that it was violating the statute.
MR. GELLER:

That is correct.

The only question as

12

the case comes to this Court is whether if the state has, in

13

fact, violated the statute, does the Secretary have available

14

to him the remedy of recoupment?

15

Let me say that these — We are not dealing here

16

with obscure or arcane provisions of the statute or regulations

17

that the states couldn't possibly have known they were violating,

18

although I understand that the states attempt to paint that

19

picture in their brief.

20

in the statute and regulations that go to the very heart of

21

the Title I program.

22

We are dealing here with requirements

As I said, New Jersey conceded before the Education

23

Appeals Board that it had, in fact, violated the statute by

24

miscalculating the amount of eligible — number of eligible

25

school attendance areas.

And, Pennsylvania didn't even

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

challenge the finding of violation by the Court of Appeals.

2
3
4

QUESTION:

you wouldn't take it in this then if the Court — Suppose we
held for you in this case —

5

MR. GELLER:

6
7

8
9

QUESTION:

12
13
14
15

Yes.
— what if we reserved the question —

What if we said this is the kind of a case where the state knew
or should have known that it was violating the statute and they
admitted they violated the statute?

10
11

If I understand what you are arguing now,

MR. GELLER:
it here.

They have admitted they have violated

But, we think that these are issues that remain to be

litigated on remand, whether the state violated the statute,
if they could reraise that issue not having raised it the first
time around.
QUESTION:

Well, is it any part of your position that

16

the state would have a defense to repayment of the money if, in

17

fact, they were found to have violated the statute but neither

18

knew or should have known that they did?

19

20

Do you think there

is some sort of an intent element?
MR. GELLER:

No, there certainly is no intent element,

21

but there is an element of discretion on the part of the

22

Secretary in determining whether to pursue his recoupment

23

remedy and there have been instances, including one that is

24

cited in" the Education Appeal Board's decision in this case, in

25

which a state may have relied on certain program directives of
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

the Secretary in doing certain thing.

2

have violated the statute, the Secretary would not be allowed

3

to recoup.

4
5

And, even if that might

But, that is —
QUESTION:

Do you think the Secretary's discretion

in that regard is reviewable by the courts?

6

MR. GELLER:

I would think that the Secretary's

7

discretion to recoup would be reviewable like any other

8

administrative decision on an arbitrary or carpricious basis.

9

But, if there has been a clear statutory violation, especially

10

if one of the conditions of the statute that goes to the heart

11

of the whole Title I program, I can't imagine how any decision

12

to recoup would be considered arbitrary.

13

QUESTION:

Is there anything, Mr. Geller, to prevent

14

the states when it approaches some project involving expendi­

15

ture of these funds and they think they might be in the gray

16

zone, is there anything to prevent them from submitting the

17

question to the secretary in charge of the grants and saying,

18

may we spend the money for this project or this program?

MR. GELLER:

No, there certainly is nothing and

agencies in the past have misapplied substantial amounts of

federal funds which they received for a particular purpose but

4

didn't use for that purpose.

5

are the Secretary's remedies?

6

QUESTION:

The only question here is what

Well, MR. Geller, it is a little hard to

7

understand.

8

if the states concede that it is available, and at least one

9

of them has, why isn't that a solution and why are we here?

10

If the Secretary thinks setoff is available and

MR. GELLER:

Well, we are here — I think there is

11

some confusion on the part of one of the states at least as to

12

what its concession is.

13

prior to 1978 any —

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. GELLER:

Pennsylvania does not concede that

New Jersey does.
Well, New Jersey has in its brief a

16

very peculiar suggestion as to what setoff is.

17

the Court some round numbers so we can all understand what we

18

are talking about.

19

fiscal year was entitled to receive $1 million in Title I funds

20

and let's assume that the Secretary has determined on the basis

21

of substantial evidence that in the past that state has misused

22

$10,000 of Title I funds.

23

brief is that the Secretary should simply only give the state

24

$990,000 of Title I funds for the upcoming fiscal year and that

25

is all they would have to spend.

Let me give

the amount of money being provided for the program in the

6

upcoming fiscal year is lower than it should be.

The government is simply repaying itself for misused
That penalizes Title I beneficiaries, the low-income

7

It penalizes them once when the funds were

That is precisely the sort of setoff that the Third

8

Circuit, we think quite correctly, said would be inconsistent

9

with the goals of the Title I program.

10

That is not how the

Secretary views his setoff authority.

11

What the Secretary would propose to do, if it ever

12

came to an administrative setoff, would be to give that state

13

$990,000, but to extract a commitment from the state to spend

14

$1 million that year in the Title I program.

15

New Jersey has never conceded that that is what it is

16

willing to do.

17

New Jersey.

18

If it would, then we would not be here as to

QUESTION:

Thank you, that helps clarify it.

Is it

19

your position that Section 415 of the General Education

20

Provisions Act, which provides that there can be adjustments

21

for overpayments, provides explicit authority for setoff?

22

MR. GELLER:

We have argued that Section 414, which

23

provides the audit authority, and Section 415, which is the

24

section to which you have just referred, together do provide

25

explicit authority.

And, in the legislative history of the 1970
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

amendments to the statute which put those sections into the

statute.

the Secretary's use of his administrative audit and recoupment

authority under the Education statutes.

Congress quite clearly said that this will facilitate

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, in analyzing New Jersey's

6

setoff position a little further, what if the Secretary followed

7

your advice and said we are going to give New Jersey $990,000

8

this year on the condition that New Jersey puts up $10,000 of

9

its own and New Jersey says, no, we won't put up $10,000 of our

own.

Then what does the Secretary do?
MR. GELLER:

situation never come to that.
QUESTION:
MR. GELLER:

Well, but —
I understand, Justice Rehnquist.

There

have been several dozen occasions in the past in which the
Secretary has determined that a state has misspent past grant
funds and they have always paid up, but in the situation that
you posited, the Secretary would not do anything that would
jeopardize the Title I program in that state.

What the Secretary

would probably do in that situation is bring a suit in District
Court to recover on the judgment.

It would not be a de novo

action to reconsider what —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GELLER:

25

Well, first of all, let me say the

To recover on what judgment?
The judgment of the Education Appeals

Board which presumably would have been an appeal to a court of
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

appeals and affirmed such as in this case.

2

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that is something that

3

simply can be filed in a district court or registered and sued

4

on like a judgment on other states?

5

MR. GELLER:

Yes, I think it can.

And, in fact,

6

that happens all the time under a great many federal programs,

7

the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Child Labor Act,

8

which provide for civil penalties through an administrative

9

process and if the defendant refuses to pay, what the govern­

10

ment will do is bring a civil action for recovery of that

11

judgment.

12

That is very common administrative procedure.
QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, I still am not clear in my

13

mind why the Secretary couldn't do exactly what you suggested

14

in answer to Justice O'Connor, namely, say you want to stay

15

in the program we are sure and you are just going to have to

16

pay $1 million to get $990,000.

17

favorable offer to the state.

18

when you have got the chips in your hands?

19

20

MR. GELLER:
to that.

21

QUESTION:
lawsuit?

23

a right to do that —

25

Why do you have to litigate it

I would assume that it would never come

That is the point I was trying to make.

22

24

That still is a pretty

Well, why doesn't that answer the whole

I really don't understand.

MR. GELLER:

If you assert you have

Yes, but the Third Circuit found that

prior to 1978 we had no right to do that and that is why this
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

case is here and why this case is of tremendous importance.

2

QUESTION:

And, Judge Higginbotham in dissent, as I

3

understood him, said, well, that issue really isn't presented

4

because you haven't tried it yet.

5

are not before us.

6
7

MR. GELLER:

10

I think that the Third Circuit mis­

understood what the Secretary was trying to do.

8
9

He said your future remedies

QUESTION:
orders.

I think they misread the Secretary's

The Secretary's orders say this amount should be paid

and they read them as orders saying they must be paid.

11

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think — The Third Circuit said

12

that the Secretary could not use his common law recoupment

13

authority in this class of case for two reasons.

14
15

QUESTION:

But, why isn't all that dicta as Judge

Higginbotham said?

16

MR. GELLER:

I think it is not dicta because Judge

17

Higginbotham assumed that the Secretary was not proceeding

18

under his common law recoupment authority.

19

20

QUESTION:

And they clearly weren't.

They weren't

using the common law recoupment power before —

21

MR. GELLER:

I believe they were, Justice Stevens.

22

I believe the Secretary has used his common law authority as

23

codified in the Federal Claims Collection Act.

24
25

QUESTION:

He didn't enter an order requiring any

payment.
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. GELLER:

Well, that is because the Federal Claims

2

Collection Act requires the Secretary to consider a number of

3

options in determining how to recovery the money and that was

4

the question that the Secretary hadn't yet decided — Hadn't

5

yet had to reach because the states had not yet said that they

6

were not going to pay the money if, after they had had their

7

administrative proceedings, it was found that they owed it.

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, isn't this like collecting on

an I.O.U. which I always thought you couldn't collect on?
MR. GELLER:

It is more than an I.O.U.

I think it

is like collecting on a contract that has been breached.
QUESTION:

I thought that the only ruling was was

that you owe this money, not that you must pay it.

14

MR. GELLER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GELLER:

No, I think the Secretary —
Am I wrong?
The Secretary's administrative ruling

17

obviously was a ruling that this money had to be paid.

18

question that hadn't yet been reached is whether, for example,

19

it would be paid in installments, it would be paid by

20

administrative recoupment from the upcoming Title I funding,

21

whether if none of those were feasible, whether it would be

22

the subject of a lawsuit in District Court.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GELLER:

25

The

That to me is an I.O.U.
I am not certain, Justice Marshall,

what you mean by an I.O.U.

There has been an administrative

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

determination here after full evidentiary proceedings that the

2

money was owed and what the states have done is taken an appeal

3

of that administrative ruling to the Court of Appeals under

4

the statutory procedure that Congress set up in 1978.

5

is a review.

6

Circuit's decision that the administrative proceedings were

7

erroneous because the Secretary had essentially no cause of

8

action prior to 1978 to proceed either administratively, either

9

under his statutory authority or under his common law authority

10

And, this

This case is here on certiorari from the Third

administratively.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, the order that the Secretary

12

entered was that New Jersey should make the following payments

13

and lists dollar amounts.

14

of the dollar amounts, but there wasn't anything in the

15

administrative proceeding as to how the amount should be paid,

16

by what mechanism payment should be enforced.

17

MR. GELLER:

Surely they could review the accuracy

I understand that, Justice Stevens,

18

but there had been a final administrative ruling that the

19

amounts were owed and —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. GELLER:

That the amounts were owed, right.
And that is what we are reviewing here,

22

whether, in fact, the Secretary had any power to order these

23

states —

25

QUESTION:

To decide how much was owed.

The Distrct

Court of Appeals didn't disagree with their power to decide how

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

much was owed.

2

MR. GELLER:

Well, as an audit matter, but certainly

3

not as a matter of power to order a recoupment of that amount

4

of money and that is what is before the Court at the moment.

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Geller, the Court of Appeals'

6

opinion certainly can be interpreted as holding that it permits

7

that offset against perspective grants is permissible under

8

Section 415.

9

holding.

10

And, that is a reasonable interpretation of the

MR. GELLER:

Yes.

The Third Circuit held that that

11

is impermissible in the context of the Title I program.

12

I think, on the basis of two misconceptions.

13

QUESTION:

It did,

One is —

I said that direct recoupment was

14

impermissible, but it indicated that the offset would be all

15

right.

16

MR. GELLER:

No, I believe not, Justice O'Connor.

17

What the Third Circuit did not reach but suggested that the

18

Secretary might be able to do is to bring a civil action, a

19

de novo civil action to recover this money, although even there

20

they left the suggestion open that prior to 1978 there would be

21

no authority, no cause of action in effect to bring such an

22

action.

23

QUESTION:

What is the difference between direct

24

recoupment and offset as it has been used by the various parties

25

to these conversations?
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. GELLER:

Well, I think — There are really two

2

questions here and they are separate.

3

to keep them separate as it analyzes this case.

4

question is prior to 1978 did the Secretary have, in effect,

5

a cause of action to recover this money at all?

6

are quite adamant that prior to 1978 there was no cause of action

7

available to the Secretary to recover this money.

I think the Court has

The second question is if there was a cause of action
to recover the money prior to 1978, how did the Secretary have

10

to pursue his cause of action?

it through administrative procedures or offset?

Circuit clearly answers that question in the negative.

QUESTION:

The Third

What is the difference between offset

and recoupment?
MR. GELLER:

I think offset is just one manner of

achieving a recoupment.
It is our principal submission that the federal

18

government, when it makes a grant subject to express conditions

19

such as those in Title I, has an inherent right to recover

20

monies expended by the grantee in violation of the express

21

conditions of the grant and that the government may exercise

22

its right of recoupment by offsetting the amounts involved

23

against sums otherwise due to the grantee.

24
25

We believe that conclusion adheres to the very
nature of the grant which, as this Court said in Pennhurst, is
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

very much like a contract.
It is well settled in cases dating back more than

3

a century in this Court that the government may recover monies

4

without resort to express statutory authority when it is paid

5

for services that were never provided.

6

The use of grant funds for purposes not authorized by

7

Congress constitutes precisely such an instance of non-performance:

8

of the terms of an agreement.

9

QUESTION:

Suppose a state has received all of the

10

money, has it in hand, has spent it and has misspent some of

11

it and then informs the Secretary that they want to withdraw

12

from the program.

13

government then?

14

What is the remedy on the part of the federal

MR. GELLER:

Well, at that point, offset would not

be available because no future funds would be going to the

16

state under the program.

I said earlier, would have to bring a civil suit to recover on

And, I assume that the Secretary, as

But,

The court would not be

Now, let me just briefly in the short time remaining

22

explain the number of the legislative developments which we

23

think make it quite clear that the Secretary had this authority

24

prior to 1978.

25

there was a long history of administrative recoupment upheld by

First of all, as I alluded to a moment ago,

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

this Court even in the absence of express statutory authority.

2

But, we have much more than that here.

3

the 1966 Federal Claims Collective Act which was passed well

4

before any of the monies in this case were misexpended which

5

clearly codifies the common-law principles and says that the

6

federal government can use all means including administrative

7

offset to recoup debts owed to it.

8
9

We have, first of all,

We have after that in 1970 the statutes that Justice
O'Connor alluded to, Sections 414 and 415 of the General Education

10

Provisions Act.

11

make it clear once again that Congress was aware that the

12

Secretary had been exercising his audit and recoupment authority

13

since the very outset of the program in 1965.

14

The legislative history of those provisions

Two years later in 1972 the Secretary set up the

15

Title I Audit Hearing Board to consider Title I claims.

16

regulations setting up that Board, which are reprinted in the

17

Joint Appendix beginning at page 158, quite clearly explain

18

that the Secretary will be engaging in audit and recoupment

19

functions.

20

The

And, on page 160 and 161, it is made quite clear

21

that — For example, no action will be taken by the Office of

22

Education with respect to the collection of the amounts due

23

to be owing if there has been a claimed filed.

24

once again a clear indication of the Secretary's audit and

25

collection authority.

This is in 1972,

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Two years after that, in 1974, Congress passes

2

20 USC 884, a statute of limitations for the Title I program,

3

saying that no funds can be recovered unless they have been

4

misspent less than five years before a final audit determination.

5

There would have been absolutely no reason for

6

Congress to have passed the statute of limitations in 1974

7

for purposes of the Title I program if respondents were right

8

that until 1968, 1978 the Secretary had absolutely no authority

9

to recover any funds under the Title I program.

Respondents

10

have never given any convincing explanation of what the 1974

11

statute of limitations was intended to do if they are right as

12

to what the Secretary's powers are.

The Secretary audits every state.

So that a state may not even know that it

of the statute and regulations are not as obscure as the

respondents would have the Court believe.

MR. GELLER:

But what if they really were obscure?
I don't — Well, let me say this.

Despite the impression that the respondents would give —

5

6

Yes.

QUESTION:

And, I don't suppose every auditor has the

same view as another auditor.

7

MR. GELLER:

I understand that Justice White, but

8

it is important to understand, especially in light of the sub­

9

mission respondents have made to this Court, that there really

10

are very, very few requirements, important requirements, imposed

n

on the states by Title I in the statute and regulations and even

12

as to those requirements, there are very few that the auditors

13

are concerned about and the violation of which would lead to a

14

recoupment.

15

Now, all of these obscure requirements they refer to,

16

recordkeeping and all the rest, those are not the sort of

17

requirements we are concerned about here.

18

is intended to supplement the regular school programs of

19

educationally deprived children in low-income areas.

20

the auditors are concerned about are whether Title I funds are

21

being used to supplement rather than supplant regular school

22

programs, whether they are going to the schools that were

23

intended by Congress and whether the programs are being

24

targeted to educationally deprived children.

25

The Title I statute

All that

It is somewhat ludicruous in a case like this where
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

New Jersey's errors in failing to comply with the statute were

2

purely mathematical, miscomputations, or in a case which

3

Pennsylvania did not even challenge in the Court of Appeals

4

that they had violated the statute.

5

make a primary submission to this case that Title I grant

6

recipients just have no way of knowing what the requirements

7

of the statute here are.

•

8
9

For the respondents to

Finally, in just going through this legislative
history, in 1978, when Congress finally put expressed recoupment

10

authority in the statute, in part I think because Congress was

11

concerned that the Secretary hadn't been adamant enough in

12

pursuing his recoupment authority, the legislative history again

13

makes it quite clear that they were not giving the Secretary

14

any new powers.

15

They were simply reiterating what the powers were that the

16

Secretary already had, putting in a new procedural framework

17

in which to exercise those powers and granting certain

18

additional due process rights to the grantees.

19

We quote from the House report in our brief.

So, we think it is inconceivable, when one looks

20

at the history of the entire Title I program from 1965 on, for

21

any grantee at any point to have come to the conclusion that

22

it was free to misspend grant funds and would not have to —

23

would not run any risk of having to account to the federal

24

government for the amount of the misused funds.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Geller, I do have one more inquiry, if
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

I may, because I still don't understand what it was that CA-3

2

was talking about.

3

to understand the department's arguments concerning the

4

operative effect of Section 415.

5

adjustments are authorized under this provision, they are to

6

be accomplished by means of an offset against current or

7

perspective grant disbursements.

8

in this case are very much different and it can't, therefore,

9

invoke the authority."

10

MR. GELLER:

In its opinion it said, "We are at a loss

Yes.

It is clear that whatever

The department's actions

I think the Third Circuit — I

11

had trouble with that portion of the Third Circuit's opinion

12

as well, Justice O'Connor.

13

must have meant is that Section 415 was intended for the

14

situation where the federal government accidentally sends

15

more money to the state in one year than they were entitled to

under the Title I program.

17

spending of money by the states, just in the following year

18

the federal government might be able to make that up.

19

I think what the Third Circuit

The Third Circuit gave a very bizarre interpretation

20

of Section 414 and 415, saying that those were just informa­

21

22

able to gather information.

23

the legislative history of those provisions which explicitly

24

refers to the Secretary's audit and recoupment authority from

It is quite inconsistent with

Suppose they had held that you could

MR. GELLER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET HUNTING, ESQ.

18

21

All right.

Thank you.
Ms. Hunting?

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19

20

I see.

MS. HUNTING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In the briefs in this case, there has been some

22

strong language used to characterize Pennsylvania's program

23

in an effort to justify the severe and unauthorized penalty

24

which is now seeks to impose.

25

I want to make to day only three points with
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

respect to his challenge.

2

conducted its Title I program in good faith and this is not a

3

case, as Justice White pointed out, where we should have known

4

that we were in violation of a set of complex regulations.

5

QUESTION:

My first point is that Pennsylvania

Well, isn't a state, when it receives

6

a grant from the federal government

7

bound to know the law?

8
9

MS. HUNTING:

under

an explicit statute

Your Honor, we agree with that.

The

state was — and this is my third point, which is that the

10

state was under an explicit statute and that we were entitled

11

to rely on that statute not only for our responsibilities, but

12

also for the extent of our liabilities.

13

In connection with that also, I want to make one

14

other point which is that when a Title I program is out of

15

compliance, the statute gives the state an opportunity to

16

correct that program before the imposition of any penalty

17

and that penalty can be lifted upon the correction of the

18

program.

19

That opportunity has been denied in this case.

This is part of the statute and has been ignored.

20

As to our first point, regarding our actual program,

21

I would like to make — point out one thing, that as Mr. Geller

22

observed, this statute envisioned a partnership between the

23

state educational agency and the federal agency in operating

24

and administering this grant.

25

is cooperative with complimentary responsibilities and

Instead of a partnership which

liabilities, the federal agency's policy of pursuing an
unauthorized repayment authority which it claims to exist is
a devisive and conflicting method of enforcing this program
which is causing the states and the federal government to fall
apart in confusion in battling over little petty disputes and
interpretations which could be resolved and should be resolved
for the benefit of the program.

8

QUESTION:

as petty, would you, despite —

This case originally was a

ten a half million dollar audit as was pointed out earlier.
QUESTION:

14

16

The amounts are not petty, Your Honor.

They are definitely not petty.

13

15

You wouldn't regard half a million dollars

It still is not petty though, is it?

MS. HUNTING:

But, the disputes themselves can

result in petty bickering which divides us on the question of
interpretation and makes administration of the program extremely
difficult.
For example — And, I wish to dispute at this point
the characterization that we haven't challenged our facts with
respect to this case.

We have not specifically talked about

the facts before the Third Circuit, but we have challenged the
procedures used to find those facts and, therefore, we do not
believe that the facts have accurately been found.
In our particular case, we had a situation where
the agency was demanding a — the federal agency is demanding

I

reimbursement for a school district operated program where the

2

Title I program was being operated at the same time as a busing

3

for desegregation program was being operated.

4

In this particular circumstance, there was a lot

5

of confusion, and this is just an example of our type of case,

6

a lot of confusion about the eligibility of students who were

7

being bused from an eligible area into an illegible area.

8

Both the federal and the state administrators were

9

confused on this subject and when the state sought advice, which

10

was recommended in a suggestion by this Court just a few moments

11

ago that advice be sought from the federal officials, when the

12

state sought this advice, the federal officials were unclear

13

as to how to handle the situation.

14

confusion in their own office and that there was a philosophical

15

gulf dividing them on how to handle this particular situation.

16

They admitted that they had

We tried to follow what direction we could get.

We

17

implemented a program and the panel itself declared that this

18

program was exemplary, the panel that heard this case.

19

However, when the auditors came out to review the

20

program, they found that the program was out of compliance

21

with these regulations and, therefore, a decision was made

22

regarding a difficult issue, which administrators and educators

23

could not agree on, by a group of auditors who were not trained

24

in the law or in education.

25

As Justice White pointed out, this is not the type
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of program that we should have known was in violation.

2

QUESTION:

3

MS. HUNTING:

Are these details before us?
Your Honor, I wish to give you this

4

characterization of our case in order to refute some of the

5

challenges that have been made and some of the language that

6

has been used, that we have converted funds, that we have

7

squandered money, because this is certainly not the case.

8

don't think it ever has been disputed —

9

QUESTION:

Do you have to worry us with that?

10

MS. HUNTING:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

I

I will go on with my next point.

Did you take the position you are now

taking before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit?
MS. HUNTING:

We took the same position, Your Honor.

14

We didn't talk about the facts in the Third Circuit because we

15

stressed the point at that time that the procedures were unfair

16

and that the facts were not properly arrived at.

17

And, I do want to point out that with respect to

18

Title I that this is an evolving program and this kind of an

19

example can show how it is evolving and the statute is perfectly

20

reasonable in not assigning liability and not requiring the

21

states to underwrite this kind of evolution of a program.

22

QUESTION:

Ms. Hunting, what in your view should the

23

federal government do if the procedures had been fair — I know

24

you disagree — and if you really had misspent money and clearly

25

misspent the money?

Would there be any remedy for the federal
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

government with the —

2

MS. HUNTING:

Your Honor, I think the remedy is

3

contained in the statute for the way the federal government

4

should handle that kind of case.

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. HUNTING:

And, what should it do?
It should follow the statutory penaltieis

7

of withholding or application disapproval.

8

penalty can be a very effective remedy for the federal

9

government.

10

QUESTION:

The withholding

Do you think it is a proper remedy to

11

say you spend a million dollars and we will give you $950,000

12

or whatever, you know, just give you the amount less that they

13

claim you have misspent?

14

MS. HUNTING:

Is that a proper way to do it?
No, Your Honor, and it is particularly

15

improper because they want to couple that with — that power

16

to offset with an order that the state make up the difference

17

and that the —

18

QUESTION:

Well, I still am not clear then.

How

19

could they — In your view, is there any way — assuming a

20

case where procedures were fair and the facts were against

21

you, a different case.

22

get its misspent money back from the State of Pennsylvania?

Is there any way the government could

23

MS. HUNTING:

24

QUESTION:

25

MS. HUNTING:

No, Your Honor.

We feel —

So the facts are really irrelevant then?
Well, I don't believe they are

relevant because in this case it is a case of good faith.
QUESTION:

If it is a matter of law, you win no

matter what the facts are under your argument?
MS. HUNTING:

Under our argument, we would win no

5

matter what the facts are, Your Honor, because there was no

6

assignment of liability in that statute.

7

was criminal, the state treasury was not responsible for this.

8

But, that does not mean that the federal government or the

9

state could go against the individuals responsible for the

Even if the conduct

10

criminal conduct and achieve reimbursement that way or it

11

doesn't mean that if the penalties provided in the statute

12

were not sufficient to enforce the statute that the federal

13

government couldn't go and seek stronger penalties to be

14

written into the Act as they eventually were in 1978 or, as it

15

suggests itself in its own brief, that they could switch to a

16

penalty — to a reimbursement system instead of having a

17

forward paid system and, therefore, if the state continued to

18

misspend funds they could just fail to reimburse them.

19

QUESTION:

You have left me somewhat confused as

20

to the obligations of the state.

21

The state gets several hundred million dollars in grants for

22

this program, but they decide that the governor of the state

23

needs an official residence so they spend a million dollars

24

to provide an official residence for the governor and then

are you suggesting for one minute seriously that the federal

government cannot make the state account for that?

dispute that the state's treasury was responsible for that

Absolutely the government could pursue with

QUESTION:

How about just withholding the next grant,

from the next grant that they receive?
MS. HUNTING:

Well, if the program continued to be

12

misadministered, then they could withhold from the next grant.

13

But, we submit that the treasury has never been made liable,

14

the state's treasury has never been made liable, has never

15

And, I will explain in my second point why that is
a fair result.
QUESTION:

Ms. Hunting, before you get to another

21

point, how is it that you think that Section 415 couple with

22

the Claims Collection Act provided no remedy for the federal

23

government before 1978?

24

MS. HUNTING:

QUESTION:

Section 415 is the —

QUESTION:

That is the payment provision of the —

It expressly allows adjustments for

3

overpayments and that coupled with the Claims Collection Act

4

would appear to have provided some pre-1978 remedies.

5

MS. HUNTING:

We have to agree with the Third Circuit

6

and with Mr. Geller's position on that, that that relates to

7

overpayments, meaning accidental payments to the states that

8

were in excess of what the state was entitled to or perhaps

9

a situation where a program did not need to expend all of its

10

funds for some reason, a teacher didn't show up or something.

11

This would be what we consider an overpayment.

12

relate to grant misexpenditures.

13
14

QUESTION:

It doesn't

Do you think there is anything in the

legislative history to put that kind of a gloss on it?

15

MS. HUNTING:

The Third Circuit noticed that there

16

was some confusion in the legislative history on this point

17

as to exactly what legislative history attached to that.

18

do not believe that that section applies to the kind of offset

19

that we are talking about here.

20

QUESTION:

We

It talks about —

Well, is there any reason why it shouldn't?

21

I mean, what is the fundamental different between some kind of

22

accidental overpayment versus the kind of thing that happened

23

here?

24
25

MS. HUNTING:

Your Honor, I think that provision,

as the Third Circuit noted, is talking in terms of adjustments
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of grants in a bookkeeping kind of situation like that.

2

not apply in this sort of situation because in this situation

3

the federal government is asking for a reimbursement and to the

4

extent that it is asking for offset, the offset is being coupled

5

with an invasion of the state's and its localities' educational

6

programs by the federal government to direct them how to spend

7

their money.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

It would

If there was an invasion as you call it

that way, wasn't there an invasion by the state into the pockets
of the federal taxpayers?

11

MS. HUNTING:

Your Honor, initially I want to point out

12

that this case is not a case of willful disregard of the

13

regulations; that this case is a case where we attempted at all

14

times to put on a good program and I do not believe that it is

15

a — I believe that Congress has the right to decide and its

16

decision should be given authority that when it assigns

17

liability for a program, and in this case it did not assign

18

liability to the state, that that decision should be put in

19

effect.

20
21

22

The state, I believe, as the grantee is entitled to
rely on the terms of the grant.
And, in this particular case, the grant guaranteed

23

to the states an opportunity to correct its program and to lift

24

the enforcement mechanism when its program was brought into

25

compliance.
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

The statutory provision of withholding can only be

2

applied until the grant program is brought into compliance and

3

this is not a discretionary provision of the statute that requires

4

the agency to notify the states of the problem and then it requires!

5

the agency to lift that enforcement provision and refund the

6

program when the program is in compliance.

7

This obviously is designed to benefit the program.

8

positive, therapeutic method of enforcing the program and it was

9

the will of Congress that this is the method to be used.

This is a benefit.
It is a

Instead,

10

the agency has ignored this particular remedy, has not ever used

11

it and has ignored its obligation under the remedy which is to

12

give timely advice and then to exercise the penalty.

13

coupled with a notice to the states that this program is out of

14

compliance and gives it an opportunity to identify what is wrong

15

with the program and then to correct it.

16

This is

Instead, what the federal government has done has been

17

to give the notice to the state at the same time it gives the

18

retroactive penalty.

19

that Congress was trying to — the scheme that Congress was

20

trying to effect in creating a withholding remedy.

21

this, this imposition of this penalty, was done not only without

22

statutory authorization but. not even with regulatory powers being

23

assigned by its own regulating power in this case.

24

My third point is that the states are entitled to rely

So, in conclusion, I would like to make

just three basic points; that when a state accepts a grant, it is

entitled to rely upon the statute in effect at the time it

accepts the grant to determine its liability and to determine

9

the extent of its liabilities.

10

For the federal agency to go

In response to a number of questions asked of Ms.

20

been under the assumption in the Third Circuit that we were

It wasn't until this Court through the Solicitor

initial step.

of the Third Circuit's decision with precisely what that court

had before it.

used to pay deficiencies found in order determination.

So, I think it is important to start the analysis

It had before it challenges to — orders from the

And, it

10

was in that setting that the Third Circuit looked to Title I

QUESTION:

Do you think the state

MR. COLE:

I think you would strain the language of

worry about the past?
MR. COLE:

That is correct.

Our essential argument

18

and that was adopted by the Third Circuit is that this statute,

19

if it allocates any risk of mistake at all by its silence, must

20

allocate that risk of loss by mistake to the federal government,

21

not to the state treasury.

because there is no unequivocal statement of congressional

23

intent that the state should be underwriting this program in

terms of bearing the risk of loss.

there is any difference?

21

MR. COLE:

That is correct, Chief Justice, because we

the principle this Court adopted in the Pennhurst decision, that

any, the government had.

to repay it either directly — And, I suspect they would make the

it indirectly because you have to underwrite the cost of the

QUESTION:

Mr. Cole?

16

MR. COLE:

Yes, sir.

17

QUESTION:

It strikes me that your analogy to the

18

Pennhurst situation is by no means a complete one.

19

in Pennhurst, Congress had granted a certain amount of money

20

and then the argument was that because of some things in the

21

legislation the states were expected to put in a great deal more

22

money if they accepted the grant.

23

are talking about comes from the federal government.

24

just a question of whether the states are expected to spend it

25

in accordance with the terms on which they received it, isn't it?

As I recall

But, here, all the money we

2

You are quite right.

That is what I said,

you know, Pennhurst is analogous.

3

QUESTION:

Not identical.

4

MR. COLE:

It is not directly on point, because you

5

are talking about imposition of an affirmative obligation.

6

are talking about the imposition of a risk.

7

should be no distinction between a remedy or an affirmative

8

undertaking in the Pennhurst analysis.

9

QUESTION:

We

But, we submit there

Well, if the focus is on what would the

10

state expect in getting into this thing, don't you think it is

11

far more likely that most people, if they accept a million dollars

12

on certain conditions, that they do a particular thing with that

13

million dollars, would expect to be held do it, then if they

14

accept a million dollars and one of the conditions that they

15

put in another $5 million of their own, but the condition is

16

somewhat vague?
MR. COLE:

17

The answer to your question is I don't

18

think that is clear, Justice, because this allocation of risk

to the states, either by way of liability of a private action

as the Court addressed in Rosado or in liability in order

22

to day.

There is something that doesn't follow as night

QUESTION:

But, you say allocation of risk as if this

24

were kind of a joint venture and each — you participated in the

25

employment of someone who made off with some funds.
45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

But, here,

1

if the government granting to New Jersey, New Jersey misspends

2

the funds, it seems to me the risk would be 100% on New Jersey

3

in a normal situation.

4

MR. COLE:

It was New Jersey employees who did it.

If I may, Justice Rehnguist, here is where

5

I think you should understand what is involved in the New Jersey

6

case and why we are talking about it in terms of risk.

7

its basic policy was to address the needs of the educationally

8

deprived student and because of the relationship with low income

9

and educational privation it targeted — Title I funds were to

Title I,

10

be targeted to areas where there was a high concentration of

11

low-income students.

12

Now, Newark — We were here in Newark and we were

13

disallowed in Newark precisely because Newark is too poor.

14

you had in Newark is you had a unique circumstance of an

15

improvished city with a high incidence throughout its history

16

of low-income population and you had the problem of incomplete

17

statistics.

18

What

I think everybody recognized that we didn't follow the

19

normal federal approach to determining eligibility.

20

the Secretary recognizes that we shouldn't have followed that

21

approach in the case of Newark because the statistics you needed

22

were simply not available.

But, even

23

So, everybody recognized you had to have an alternative

24

approach and the dispute here is whether the alternative approach

25

for calculation that we used is acceptable.

The Secretary found

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

it was not.

2

than that that had been done by the State of New Jersey on

3

recalculation and by the district in the first instance.

4

The Secretary opted for a more conservative approach

Secondly, what is at dispute here is whether the entire

district.

pointing out —

that the federal government made the choice initially that there

should be no recoupment in the sense —

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Do you mean the federal government gave

New Jersey the money to do with as they pleased?
MR. COLE:

Without exposing the New Jersey treasury

to risk, yes, that is our position.

24

QUESTION:

That is your view of the pre-1978 matter?

25

MR. COLE:

That is correct, Chief Justice.
47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

So, in your view, must this Court now

2

decide whether you are right about that 1978 amendment and the

3

legal rights of the two parties prior to 1978?

4

MR. COLE:

If the federal government is not pursuing

5

a course of action that would affirmatively impose obligations

6

on the state treasury, the answer is no.

7

the position on offset, they would want the state treasury to

8

make up the difference in the loss of grant funds.

9

QUESTION:

But, as I understand

I don't think the federal government is

10

going after the state treasury.

11

is going after its money which the state treasury took.

MR. COLE:

the state treasury.

16

I think the federal government

With respect, Justice Marshall, that would
That money has been spent.

So, in fact, they are going after

I started to say before in common law the Third

17

Circuit never decided what, if any, common law rights the federal

18

government had against the state government.

19

on that score that all the cases cited in the Solicitor General's

20

brief involve individuals or involve situations where a particular

21

program has a regulatory scheme in effect which imposes that

22

liability.

23

state government have been found other than the West Virginia

24

case where it was a non-explained dictum.

25

I would point out

I know of no case where common law rights against

QUESTION:

Well, we don't need to reach that question
48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

if we were to find that the statutory authority before 1978

2

authorized some kind of recovery, do we?

3

MR. COLE:

No, you do not, Justice O'Connor.

4

QUESTION:

And, I guess the main thrust of the Court

5

of Appeals' reason for not finding the pre-1978 authority was

6

its view that if it had existed the 1978 legislation would not

7

have been necessary.

8
9
10

MR. COLE:

That is correct.

They could not find — I

believe it is Section 185 — would have served any purpose had
the authority had existed as the federal government has alleged.

11

QUESTION:

And, perhaps that argument isn't correct

12

either if there is a difference' between offset and outright

13

recovery in some other fashion.

14

MR. COLE:

That is true, but from our standpoint, we

15

take the view that the Third Circuit probably concluded that

16

there were no affirmative funding obligations on the state prior

17

to 1978.

18

Under common law, I would make one last point and

19

of course, we all know that in common law the principle of

20

sovereign immunity extends to state governments as well as the

21

federal government so it is somewhat anomalous to talk about

22

the federal government being in the same position vis a vis the

23

state as a private creditor at common law, wherein common law

24

that private creditor would have had no rights whatsoever against

25

the state government because of sovereign immunity.
49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Just very briefly in summary we say that the legislation

that existed for Title I prior to 1978 did not impose any risk

on state treasury.

adopted by the Secretary which assumed that he had this authority

or intended to impose it.

should not find that the state treasury is liable for any mis-

They couldn't even say we will eliminate

MR. COLE:

I don't think the withholding or suspension —

I think that would be an abuse of that provision.

could do is the change of state from a grants funding program

to a reimbursement program and, therefore, really strictly

police its expenditures in the future.

QUESTION:

What they

But then could they subtract from the

11

reimbursement under such a program the amount that they found

due under this audit?

MR. COLE:

is that they have some offset authority.
