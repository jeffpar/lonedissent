ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CLAIRBORNE:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

7

the Court.

8

River in western North Dakota, so far as that river lies in that

9

state.

This dispute is over the bed of the Little Missouri

This is a river which has been described as a raging

10

torrent in the summertime and a bare trickle in the winter.

11

one as to which an explorer wTith the Lewis and Clark Expedition in

12

1804, after struggling down it for 45 days, emphatically declared

13

it non-navigable.

14

It is

Nevertheless, the State of North Dakota now claims

15

that bed on the ground that it was at the time of its admission

16

to the state in 1889 and today a navigable stream.

17

mind the last 35 miles or so of the stream where it borders or

18

traverses an Indian reservation.

19

not at issue in this case.

20

We put out of

That portion of the riverbed is

But, for the rest the state claims the whole of the

21

bed saying that that bed as the bottom of a navigable water body

22

inured to the state under the Equal Footing Doctrine at statehood

23

and by virtue of its Organic Act and by confirmation in the

24

Submerged Lands Act of 1953.

25

The United States, on the other hand, claims substantial

portions of the same riverbed—perhaps, as much as a third of

2

that riverbed.

3

position that the river was not and is not navigable, and therefore

4

did not inure to the state under the Equal Footing Doctrine or

5

Submerged Lands Act.

6

The federal claim is based on the opposite pro­

The United States claims partly as riparian owner of

7

the land immediately on the banks of the river, sometimes the

8

mineral estates, sometimes the surface estates, sometimes both.

9

Some of these are public lands reserved and retained by the United

10

States since the beginning.

11

subsequently.

12

Some of them are lands reacquired

In some cases, the United States claims the bed, but

13

not the riparian land.

17

waiving its claim to the bed in those Sections 16 and 36.

Organic

That occurred because the state, which

Act, determined to reject the submerged portions
thereby

As the evidence of navigability in this case suggests

19

and we say it suggests the non-navigability of the river — it is

20

not surprising that the state made no claim with respect to this

21

bed for the better part of the first century since it was admitted

22

to the state.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

How could they have made such a claim,

Mr. Claiborne, before the enactment of the Quiet Title Act?
MR. CLAIBORNE:

I am saying they never asserted
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

ownership, Justice Rehnquist, by leasing or by granting patents

2

with respect to portions of the bed, or easements, or taking any

3

other action which indicates their assertion of dominion with

4

respect to that bed.

5

Indeed, so far as the record shows, North Dakota never

6

asserted in any way any claim of ownership vis-a-vis the United

7

States or vis-a-vis private landowners until at the earliest 1962.

8
9

On the contrary, in 1955 when the Bureau of Land
Management of the Department of the Interior specifically asked

10

the State Attorney General whether in the State's view, the river

11

was or had been at statehood navigable and accordingly appertained

12

to the State, the express answer came back, "No, this river has

13

not and is not now navigable."

14

Shortly, thereafter the United States began leasing

15

portions of the bed, treating it as property of the United

16

States.

17

1966, more than 12 years before this suit was filed, approximately

18

100 since that time.

19

There were some 39 such oil and gas leases by October,

In 1962, the United States began leasing competitively

20

which required publication and notice, and we say, a further

21

reason why the State should have been aware of the federal claim.

22
23
24
25

Now, apparently, in that same year, 1962, the State
itself granted —
QUESTION:

Mr. Claiborne, you said the State should

have been aware of the federal claim at that time.

Now that is

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

a whole different position than your statement that the State

2

asserted no interest of its own.

3
4

What could the State have done before the enactment
of the Quite Title Act, if it did become aware of the federal claim ?

5

MR. CLAIBORNE:

According to the State's argument, it

6

could have filed suit, regardless of the Quiet Title Act.

7

take the opposite position, but —

8
9

QUESTION:

We

Well, under your view, what could it have

done?

10

MR. CLAIBORNE:

But the State could have granted leases.

11

It could have asserted its ownership without — even if it were

12

unable to file a suit against the United States, or it could

13

have —

14
15
16

QUESTION:

I suppose it could have dispossessed the

United States' lessees.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Indeed.

And it could at least have

17

notified the United States that it claimed the bed, and invited

18

the United States to file a suit to settle the matter judicially.

19

It did none of any of those things.

20

QUESTION:

My own experience in private practice was

21

that invitations to the United States to file a suit to Quiet

22

Title were not often accepted.

23
24
25

(Laughter)
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice Rehnquist, our record in this

respect may be uneven, but my impression is that the United States

1

has been rather receptive to overcoming the power of sovereign

2

immunity by itself instituting an action to determine judicially

3

a disputed land claim with states.

4

the Submerged Lands Act since the first California case through

5

the more recent case involving the Atlantic Coast States, United

6

States v. Maine.

7

That has been the history of

All of those suits were those which could not have

8

been brought by the state, but which the United States, though

9

maintaining its ownership, determined it was only right and proper

10

to have tested in this Court.

11

In this case, had that been the view of the United

12

States, we would have instituted such a suit.

13

claim is simply so lacking in merit, it does not justify such an

14

action.

15

In all events, they were rather indications of the

16

state's disclaimer of ownership after notice.

17

burden the Court with those details.

18

is asked to decide.

19

In our view, this

But I will not

That is not what this Court

There is a question that undecided whether sufficient

20

notice was given by the courts below, and if our position prevails

21

the case would have to be returned to the District Court for a

22

determination — a finding on that question.

23

At all events, in 1978 the State filed suit asserting

24

its title to the bed and seeking to enjoin the federal officials

25

from, in their words, asserting ownership through the granting of
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

leases and other activity.

2

The question is whether that suit was filed too late.

3

Now, although the State sued the Secretary of Agriculture and the

4

Chief of the Forest Service and the Secretary of the Interior,

5

and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, we asserted in

6

defense to the State's suit that this was in reality a suit

7

against the United States to quiet title to land in which the

8

United States claimed an interest.

9

governed by the federal Quiet Title Act, Section 2409a of the

10

Judicial Code.

11
12

And, accordingly a suit

The District Court agreed and required the State to
amend its complaint to allege that jurisdictional basis.

13

At this point, the question before the Court was whether

14

the limitations provision of the Quiet Title Act applied.

15

that limitations provision, which is set out in our brief at page

16

3, is subsection (f) of 2409a.

17

"Any civil action" — I stress the word "any" — "under this

18

section shall be barred unless it is commenced within twelve years

19

of the date upon which it accrued.

20

to have accrued on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in

21

interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United

22

States."

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CLAIBORNE:

25

QUESTION:

Now,

And, it provides as follows:

Such action shall be deemed

When was that enacted, Mr. Claiborne?
In 1972, Your Honor.

What would be the effect as of the date
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the thing came into effect in 1972 of a claim,

2

by anybody else against the government, which had, say, accrued

3

in 1952?

4

MR. CLAIBORNE:

say,

by a state or

Such a claim would be barred because

5

while as originally proposed there was a grandfather clause

6

allowing stale claims to be filed within a short period.

7

the Congress agreed with the suggestion of the federal represen­

8

tatives that that would open the doors to too many claims and that

9

rather than have a six-year period it would reach back twelve

10

years.

11

stale than that.

12

Ultimatel y

But, there would be no grandfather clause for claims more

Now, assuming that statute and that limitations pro­

13

vision of the statute applied, the second question was whether the

14

State knew or should have known of the federal claim more than

15

12 years before the suit was

17

was inapplicable and that the State accordingly should focus its

18

attention on the issue of navigability.

19

filed.

The State's stance in the

The United States, on the other hand, focused on the

20

threshold question, the jurisdictional question, the limitations

21

question, and produced evidence with respect to State knowledge of

22

the federal claim more than 12 years before the suit was filed

23

and argued that accordingly the action should be dismissed.

24
25

The District Court agreed with the State holding that
the limitations provision was inapplicable under these
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

circumstances and, therefore, made no finding with respect to

2

whether the State had knowledge, actual or constructive, 12 years

3

before the suit was filed.

4

Court found that the river was, indeed, navigable, and accordingly

5

that the State had ownership.

6

And reaching the merits, the District

On appeal the Court of Appeals for the Eigth Circuit

7

agreed with the District Court on both points, and accordingly

8

affirmed.

9

We petitioned in this Court solely on the limitations

10

point, not because we concede the navigability of the river, but

11

because we felt that it was inappropriate to burden this Court

12

with a purely fact-bound question of the navigability of this

13

particular river.

14

Court, that the courts should not have reached the issue of

15

navigability because they had no jurisdiction, the action having

16

been barred by limitations.

17

We argued in all courts, including in this

Our argument is entirely straightforward.

We say this

18

is an action which is in effect a suit to divest the United States

19

of lands which it claims to own, which is barred by sovereign

20

immunity except only as Congress has waived that bar.

21

We say this principle applies to states as well as

22

private citizens.

23

sovereign immunity in the Quiet Title Act, Section 2409a, in

24

respect of this class of suit, but it did so on express conditions

25

We note that in 1972 Congress did waive

And, one of those conditions, subsection (f) of the
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

statute, is that the suit be filed within 12 years after knowledge,

2

actual or constructive, of the federal claim.

3

Now, since as the District Court held and the Court of

4

Appeals assumed, rightly, we think, North Dakota must invoke this

5

statute.

6

of the statute also be bound by the conditions, including the

7

limitations provision.

8
9

It must, like any other plaintiff, invoking the benefits

We see no basis for creating a special exception
because North Dakota's claim of title here is constitutionally

10

derived in the sense that the Equal Footing Doctrine is responsible

11

for the State's alleged ownership of the riverbed.

12

rights, like any others, can be barred by the failure to assert

13

them within a given time.

14

QUESTION:

Constitutional

What if Congress had enacted no Quiet Title

15

Act here that authorized suit at all?

16

done with respect to lands which it claimed under the Equal

17

Footing Doctrine?

18

What could the State have

What, if any, as against the federal government?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We say, Justice Rehnquist, first that

19

so far as that claim was alleged against the United States

20

and, of course, I put aside such a claim against private individua] s

21

as to which there is no bar — the sovereign immunity of the

22

United States would have prevented the bringing of such an action.

23

—

Alternatively, we say that even if that were not true,

24

since 1972 Congress has provided a leachant procedure for the

25

assertion of such claims by states of others and that the state
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

has failed to comply with the conditions of that limited procedure.

2

QUESTION:

So, there might have been an eminent domain

3

type of — Jacobs type of cause of action before 1972, but not

4

afterwards, or Congress would have specified the procedure?

5

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think that is so.

Though, if we had

6

a different situation in which the United States for the first

7

time seemed to be taking the State's sovereign lands, even after

8

1972, the State would have the option of either suing us under

9

the Quiet Title Act or suing us — put claims under the Tucker

10
11

Act.
And, indeed, one of the novelties of this case is that

12

the Quiet Title Act provides that if the United States wishes to

13

keep the property, notwithstanding the judgment is going against

14

it, it may do so.

15

the District Court is in any event improper.

16

And, to that extent the injunction entered by

Now, as I say, constitutional rights, like any other

17

rights, can be barred by the failure to assert them timely.

18

classical example being rights under the Just Compensation Clause

19

which this Court and other courts have held are barred if not

20

filed within six years.

21

The

States are subject to limitations, witness this Court's
venerable decision in Louisiana v. United States.
State land claims can be barred altogether by the

18

All sovereigns, including the State of North Dakota, invoke that

19

Doctrine from time to time.

20

22

Rights without a remedy may be rare in the

Here we do not have a right without any remedy.

We

simply have a limited remedy.
As I have said, the United States by and large has

23

been receptive to paving the way to the judicial resolution of

24

state claims, which were otherwise barred by sovereign immunity,

25

by itself instituting the law suit.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

But there is a limit to all good deeds.

Here the

2

United States determined not to file its own action, at least not

Now, the practical importance of this question is sub­

For these reasons, we urge the Court to reverse the

MR. WEFALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

The threshold issue here is navigability.

I have to

10

point out a couple of things that should be noted right here.

11

have a couple of things that the Petitioners have not in this case.

12

First of all, we have evidence of navigability.

We

Second

13

of all, we have the decision of the District Court and the Eighth

is navigable.

gability, the State of North Dakota is out of court, period.

18

is interesting also to note that, of course, when we review the

19

evidence, Brother Claiborne failed to note, that the Corps of

20

Engineers in 1975, which is Exhibit A in the trial transcript,

21

had a study that concluded that the Little Missour River was

22

navigable.

There is plenty of evidence.

QUESTION:

You mean you have to decide whether a stream

MR. WEFALD:

QUESTION:

I would hope so.

May I ask a question —
Yes, sir.
May I ask this question if this is what in

8

effect you are arguing that if the State had acquired title not

9

through its sovereign status and the navigability of the river

10

and so forth, but rather by purchase from a private person and so

11

forth, would you conceed the statute of limitations would bar the

You are saying the statute does not

to abide by the condition?

MR. WEFALD:

The answer found by the Court of Appeals

against a sovereign state claiming a sovereign interest.

MR. WEFALD:

QUESTION:

Even though the opposition is the United

MR. WEFALD:

There is no question about the fact that

Doctrine, the clear constitutional argument that sovereignty with

QUESTION:

claims comparable to the dispute between the State and the United

may also be claiming parts of the riverbed?

8

10

MR. WEFALD:

No, sir, not that I am aware. ' I am aware

of no such thing.
QUESTION:

Is that because the United States is the

11

riparian owner all along the river, or you just have not asserted

12

any such claims against private owners?

MR. WEFALD:

14

no particular problem.

With respect to private owners, we have

21

the constitutional argument that we have suggested.

22

another line of cases, and I believe several of the cases have

23

been cited by the government — by the Petitioners in their

24

brief on pages 30 to 34, Davis v. Passman, Carlson case.

25

these are cases that follow up on, I think, the Lee, Larson and

There is

Now,

2

to bring a claim against an official, notwithstanding whether or

3

not there is a particular statutory remedy available.

So, we think there is an adequate basis to get to court

5

with respect to the claim we are making.

6

emphasize again that if we were to follow the logic of the

Petitioners' position here today, North Dakota would have been

out of court, would have lost all of its right to sue under the

because with respect to our constitutional scheme of government

and the retained sovereignty of states, in particular the additiona.

It was

Mr. Chief Justice, briefly.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. CLAIBORNE:

First, Justice Stevens gave a better

14

answer in his question to Justice Rehnquist than I did.

15

Justice Rehnquist said what could the State have done if it

16

claimed the bed of this river before 1978?

17

could have sued the private landowners who enjoyed no sovereign

18

immunity and who, I assume, having two-thirds of the river,

19

were likewise granting leases or otherwise exerting ownership

20

over what they thought was their portion of the riverbed.

21

such suit has, to this date, been filed.

22

When

One answer is it

No

Now, addressing Justice White's query with respect to

23

the alternative basis for affirmance urged by North Dakota, it

24

is fair to remind the Court that North Dakota filed a conditional

25

cross petition of certiorari as to which the Court has taken no

Although, we oppose that cross petition on reconsideratio n

action.

2

in our brief, we urge the Court to consider the issue raised

3

there if that issue is not otherwise available as an alternative

4

ground for affirmance, because it seems to us wasteful and,

5

indeed, perhaps only an advisory opinion if this Court were to

2

they would previously lie against the officer, should now be

3

filed under the following conditions — the limitations

provision is not the only condition — against the United States

5

itself, and we see in that enactment no preservation of any

previous alternative, but, on the contrary, a regular arising of
