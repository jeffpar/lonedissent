CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS N. LETTER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Letter.

MR. LETTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
There are two issues before the Court in this case.

8

The first is whether attorneys in the Civil Division of the

9

Department of Justice may have access as of right to grand jury

10

material as attorneys for the government pursuant to Federal

11

Rules of Criminal Procedure, 6(e)(3)(A)(i) and 54(c).

12
13
14

The second issue is what standard the Civil Division
must meet to show grand jury material to assisting personnel.
If the Court rules against us on the first issue, then

15

the second issue also concerns what standard the Division must

16

meet for access by its own attorneys.

17

It is our position that this case does not involve

18

a question of grand jury secrecy, but instead concerns how the

19

Attorney General organizes the Department of Justice.

20

Briefly, the facts were that Respondents, Sells, Witte,

21

and Sells Engineering Corporation were indicted on a number of

22

counts of tax fraud and fraud against the United States.

23

were other persons who were also indicted along with them.

24
25

There

Sells and Witte were officers in Sells Engineering
Corporation which had contracts with the Department of the Navy

to produce defense systems.

2

The Defendants moved to quash the indictments making

3

various allegations of grand jury abuse.

4

seems to have been at the time they were complaining about an

5

indictment based on hearsay, it appears.

6

QUESTION:

The main allegation

Is the term grand jury abuse a word of art?

7

I noticed it in the opinion of the Ninth Circuit in this case.

8

was not otherwise familiar with it.

9

MR. LETTER:

I do not think that it is a word of art,

10

Your Honor.

11

ones who used it.

12

say, they claim that apparently they thought the grand jury had

13

been used for an improper purpose by the U.S. Attorney's office.

14

I think that is what they mean by abuse.

15

I believe in this case, Respondents are the first
I believe it is unclear what they mean.

As I

Even though they made this motion to quash the indict­

16

ment, Sells and Witte withdrew the motion and pleaded guilty to

17

a count of conspiracy to commit fraud against the government by

18

inhibiting an investigation — a tax investigation.

19

the guilty pleas were entered, the Civil Division of the Depart­

20

ment of Justice came into the District Court where the criminal

21

proceedings were pending and sought access to the grand jury'

22

materials.

23

that it might need them in order to bring a false claims action

24

against some of the defendants.

25

I

Shortly before

The Division sought the materials because it thought

As far as other defendants were concerned, one other

defendant pleaded guilty and another defendant was convicted.

2

In order to avoid any confusion, I think it would be

3

important at this point to look precisely at Rule 6(e) itself.

Rule —

5

QUESTION:

Before you do that, can I ask one question

6

about the way the case developed — about when you say they came

7

in and sought access, by

8

court?

9

MR. LETTER:

10

QUESTION:

that you mean they filed a motion in

That is correct.
Did they before doing that ask the United

11

States Attorney in charge of the criminal prosecution just to

12

turn the material over?

13

MR. LETTER:

14

QUESTION:

I do not believe they did.
Now if you prevail in the case they could

15

have done that, we would have avoided all of these issues, is that

16

right?

17

MR. LETTER:

They could have done it for the Civil

18

Division attorneys, correct.

19

we concede that —

20
21

22

QUESTION:

But, for the assisting personnel

There would have been an argument, yes.

But,

for the attorneys themselves they could have just asked for it.
MR. LETTER:

That is right.

And, in fact, they made

23

that argument to the District Court.

24

Fifth Circuit decision upon which we were relying the Civil

25

Division attorneys were entitled as a matter of right.

They said that under the

MR. LETTER:

3

QUESTION:

As long as you are interrupted, may I ask —
Sure.
It is your position that under your view the

4

Civil Division attorneys could have these grand jury materials as

a matter or right.

6

attorney would have to get a court order before disclosing the

7

grand jury materials to support personnel?

Would you then think that the Civil Division

attorney's secretary?

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. LETTER:

When you say support personnel meaning the

Yes.
No, we do not believe so.

We think that

12

the secretaries for the Civil Division attorneys must be considered

13

in essence part of the attorneys themselves.

14

would be that otherwise it would be very difficult for the

15

attorneys to even make the motion —

MR. LETTER:

A reason for this

How about other people working for —
I am sorry?
How about other people working for them?
Well, if we are talking about technical

20

personnel like accountants, things like that, then, yes, they

21

would need an order under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i), but the secretaries

22

would not because otherwise it would be difficult for the attorneys

23

to even make a motion to the court because if the motion was

24

going to discuss the grand jury material, the attorneys apparently

25

would have to type it themselves, and we do not think that

Correct.
And, a division of the U.S. Attorney wants

to see them?

That is correct.

QUESTION:

You did not want to give them to anybody

outside of the United States Department of Justice?

12

MR. LETTER:

We did.

We also wanted to give them to

13

personnel from the Department of the Navy to help analyze this

had to to show it to the Navy personnel.
QUESTION:

And, the only reason we got this case is

because you filed a motion.
MR. LETTER:

As far as why we have an appeal is because

Respondents objected to the disclosure.
If we can go back a moment, as I say, it would be

without a court order to attorneys for the government in the per­

formance of their duties.

Rule 54(c) then defines attorneys for the government as

21

authorized assistants of the Attorney General and authorized

22

assistants of the United States Attorneys.

QUESTION:

No, under Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) —

— they could have.

There would be some

23

question, I suppose, whether they could appear in court without

25

it on their behalf — their lawyers.

The Department of Justice could seek
The Department of Navy

attorneys cannot appear on court on their own behalf.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Letter, do you think the words, "attorney

3

for the government" as used in (3)(A)(i) that you just read to

4

us have the same meaning as the words, "attorney for the govern­

5

ment" in the general rule of secrecy provision about who can go

6

into the grand jury?

7

8

MR. LETTER:

I think that there are two ways of looking

at that, and I think either one supports our position.

9

One is that they do not mean precisely the same thing.

10

Rule 6(d), I think, -is what you are referring to which sets out

11

who can be in the grand jury room.

12

Clearly, Rule 6(e) cannot mean that only attorneys who

13

were in the grand jury room can have access to the grand jury

14

materials.

15

where a Department of Justice attorney handles a presentation to

16

the grand jury, and then that attorney leaves government service.

17

Now, obviously, a new attorney has to be appointed in order to

18

handle the criminal prosecution.

19

the new attorney who was not in the grand jury room and since at

20

the time he had nothing to do with handling the grand jury

21

probably should not have been in the grand jury room, could

22

nonetheless have access to the grand jury materials in order to

23

prepare the criminal case.

24
25

The reason I say that is a situation often happens

It is clear under Rule 6(e) that

Another way of looking at it is to say that the sections
do mean the same,, and there is nothing in Rule 6(d) that would

prohibit a Department of Justice, Civil Division attorney from

sitting in during a grand jury presentation.

the practice of the Department of Justice, mostly because we wish

to avoid any appearance that a grand jury is being used for civil

purpose.

I would like to set out up front why the Civil Division

needs the grand jury material.

when there has been criminal conduct, and it is possible that

The Division often receives

there would be a civil fraud action.

11

It gets this material obviously long before any civil

12

case is filed, and it uses the material for screening purposes.

Very often, the Civil Division attorneys will look at the material

14

and decide that there is no false claims action here and so they

will drop the case.

16

resources in further investigation.

17

They will not use Department of Justice

Thus, this access to the grand jury material really

18

leads to better governmental practices, because it means that the

19

Department does not have to file premature civil fraud complaints

20

which would obviously be —

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Letter, I take it, then, the government

22

does not follow the practice of many private civil litigants of

23

simply filing a law suit and getting rather extensive discovery

24

to decide whether the law suit should have been filed?

25

MR. LETTER:

That is precisely correct, Your Honor, but
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

Is that what all the fighting is about here

2

because I had the impression from reading the briefs that if the

3

government were precluded from doing what it did here it could

4

have filed a civil action for fraud, gotten very extensive dis­

5

covery and presumably gotten everything it could have gotten

6

from the grand jury?

Not entirely, Your Honor, but let me go

through that.

it, but if it is some other witness, there is no guarantee that

might be able to get much of the material from discovery.

Obviously, there is some problem of delay, but that would require

8

the Department of Justice to duplicate the investigation that it

just did for the criminal proceedings.

In any event, we

do not see that there is any evidence that Congress intended to

talking about thousands of hours in investigatory work.

14

while it might be possible to get much of this material, it would

cause an enormous amount of work, and the sad thing would be, once

This practice of access as of right by Civil Division

It is also not limited to the Civil Division in U. S. Attorneys

offices and other divisions within the Justice Department.

2

Attorneys with civil responsibilities have routinely had access

as a matter of right to the grand jury material.

the Civil Division is entitled to access as of right under

plain language helps us again.
If we look at Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) and Rule 6(e)(3)(B)

20

both of them have a crucial clause that was added in 1977 that is

21

missing from Rule 6(e)(3)(A)(i) and that is, assisting personnel

I would like to take a moment and say something I was

much in focus.

We are talking here about a vestige of the power

1

of the absolute monarch, one of the few that remains in this

2

country.

3

We are talking here about the ex parte subpoena power

of the grand jury that can make you come forthwith and answer

5

anything that they depend to ask on you about any nook and

It has got to be

You mean a person cannot invoke the Fifth

Amendment before the grand jury?

15

MR. ROBBINS:

Not really, because they can give you

16

immunity, either use or transaction, and make you answer.

17

that is a different question.

18

QUESTION:

Now,

Well, they can invoke the Fifth Amendment,

19

but then our cases have held that the immunity is a whole equal

law.

21

MR. ROBBINS:

I am sorry.

Let me clarify it.

You

cannot be convicted by the testimony you would give, but they

can make you answer, Your Honor.

24

There are things you may not want to answer.

QUESTION:

And, that is what is important.

Well, there are lots of things you may not

That does not mean the government cannot ask.

MR. ROBBINS:

True.

But my point is, protection from

And, now, to use it for civil?

That is the question we

had, just one Attorney General of the United States.

Are you saying it is wrong for him to do this?
MR. ROBBINS:
QUESTION:

Yes, I am saying it is wrong.

And saying — For years and-years the

Anti-Trust Division used to run grand juries and sometimes they
would indict and sometimes they would not, then they would bring
a civil proceeding after.
You are saying all of those civil proceedings were
improperly brought if the information was obtained in a criminal
investigation that then aborted?
MR. ROBBINS:

The question was raised in a sense in

Proctor & Gamble.

answer that.

MR. ROBBINS:

that Proctor & Gamble does raise — I am going to give you a

The thing that was not discussed by anybody was under
what process of procedure should the government be able to get
this material.

But, what process of procedure should the attorneys

for the government be using it.

That was not the issue here

because that was the issue two years earlier, and it did not
come up on appeal.

It just wasn't.

And, this Court had a hard

time coming to grips with the one thing they did decide or two.
Look at the major issues they did not want to try to wrestle with
or could not wrestle with at the time.

It was a strongly divided

15

Court.

16

It was the first leg of the triad because, as far as the govern­

17

ment is concerned, it said nobody else out there can have this

18

material but us except on a particularized and compelling need.

It was clearly a dual purpose grand jury case situation.

They say so because of lack of

15

That is howthey argue it.

16

First, the only and single issue addressed in the 1977

secrecy because as Justice Marshall has pointed out a couple of
