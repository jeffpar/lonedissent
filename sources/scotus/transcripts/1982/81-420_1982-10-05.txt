ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD DAVID DRAKE, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DRAKEi

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The instant case presents two substantial

9

10 questions concerning our nation’s system of
11

federalism.

The initial inquiry focuses upon the deference which the

12 federal judiciary sitting in a habeas corpus action

13 brought by a state inmate must afford the factual
14 determinations made by the state court.
15 this threshold issue centers upon

A resolution of

this Court's prior

16 decisions in Sumner v. Mata and Henderson v.

Morgan.

The secondary question before this Court

17

18 concerns the continuing viability of this Court's
/

19 decision in Spencer v. Texas.

It is respectfully

20 submitted that the court below erred with respect to
21

22
23

both issues.
The facts of this case are essentially
uncontroverted.

The respondent was indicted in the Ohio

24 Court of Common Pleas for aggravated murder.

Under then

25 prevailing law aggravated murder was essentially a
3

1

felony murder.

Here, the respondent was indicted for

2 rape during commission of a murder.

The grand jury as a

3

separate and distinct matter also returned a death

4

penalty specification, alleging that the respondent had

5

previously been convicted of attempted murder in Cook

6 County, Illinois.

Prior to trial the respondent filed a motion

7

8 to dismiss the death penalty specification, alleging

9 that his 1972 Illinois guilty plea was not intelligently
10

entered.

Pursuant to this pretrial motion the Ohio

11

trial court conducted a full evidentiary hearing.

12

During the course of the hearing several pertinent facts

13

were developed.
It was developed that the respondent had been

14
15

incarcerated on at least two prior occasions in the

16

Illnois penal system; that he had been charged with and

17

involved with the Illinois courts unrelated to those

18

prior incarcerations with both rape and murder; that in

19

addition to those crimes he had appeared before the

20 Illinois judiciary on several different occasions by his
21

own admission.
It was further developed that respondent was

22
23

incarcerated continuously in the Cook County jail for a

24

period of 13 months prior to the entry of this guilty

25

plea.

8 respondent with one count of attempt under Illinois law

9 and three counts of aggravated battery.
Respondent was once again arraigned in the

10
11

Illinois -- before another Illinois court on these

12 charges.

It was further developed and the Ohio trial

13 court made a finding of fact that the respondent was
14 both intelligent and literate.

The respondent also

15 conceded that he was represented throughout his 13-month
16 pretrial incarceration by two attorneys.
17

During the course of the hearing the

18 respondent contended that he was never informed of the
19 attempt charge, neither by service of the indictment, at
20 the preliminary hearing, at either of his two
21

arraignments, by either of his two attorneys, or in any

22 other manner.

23

At the conclusion of the Ohio evidentiary

24 hearing the Ohio trial court expressly found that the
25

Illinois guilty plea had been tendered and was tendered
5

in an intelligent and voluntary manner and that the plea

2 was therefore valid.

It is therefore obvious that the

Ohio trial court rejected as self serving testimony of

the respondent.

1

that he had pled guilty to it.

2

This in the face of a record wherein the trial

3

judge mentions the crime attempt, indicates the separate

4 penalties for attempt, and where his lawyer at the
5 conclusion stipulated that the indict — the charges,
6 plural,

in the indictment were sufficient both in law

7 and fact.
8

I don't believe it's ever been argued that the

9 Ohio trial court so horrendously misunderstood

the issue

10

before him, and it's never been alleged that he applied

11

the wrong standard, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION;

But it is true that the Ohio court

13 did not say in so many words that the defendant knew he
14 was charged with attempt,
15

MR. DRAKE*

16 to your question I

did it?

Your Honor, I would -- in response

would refer the Court to this Court's

17 decision in LaVallee v.

Delle Rose wherein this Court

18 indicated that given a straightforward factual
19 consideration —

QUESTION*

Well, it seems to me you can answer

my question without referring to another case.

22

MR. DRAKE*

23

QUESTION*

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
The trial court did not in so many

24 words find that he had been aware of the fact that he
25 was charged with attempt.

Not expressly, Your Honor.

That

is entirely implicit by his finding.
QUESTION*

3

You infer that from the finding

4 that he intelligently and voluntarily entered his plea.
MR. DRAKE*

5

I believe it would be logically

6 inconsistent not to infer that, Your Honor.

Is the indictment in the papers

Yes.

Honor.
QUESTION:

Yes.

And was the defendant in the

23 courtroom at the time?
24

MR. DRAKE:

He conceded that he was at the

25 Ohio evidentiary hearing.

He never contended that he

That was the crux of his

He's never indicated he was not in the

6 courtroom, no.

Respondent thereupon proceeded to trial.

7

In

8 order to prove the substantive charge of aggravated

9 murder the prosecutor presented in part, and most
10 important,
11

the testimony of the two sons of the victim.

The testimony was fairly straightforward.

12 sons indicated that

The two young

the respondent was at their home

13 that evening, the only gentleman present.

The one son

14 indicated he had heard his mother scream.

The other son

15 thereafter went down to the kitchen and spoke with
16 respondent briefly.

The lights were out, and the

17 respondent ordered him not to turn the lights on and
18 also ordered the child back to bed.
19

The body of the victim was subsequently found

20 in a state of

found was a bent and bloodstained 12-inch knife.

Also
The

22 cause of death was the victim's throat was slashed.

A

23 pack of cigarettes of the respondent’s brand were found
24 in the apartment, and also there was blood on the
25 respondent's clothing.
9

That was the evidence that the state adduced

rape/murder.
QUESTION*

4
5

General Drake, may I ask you a

question about Ohio nomenclature?

Is a specification

6 something that just pertains if a death penalty is being
7

8
9

sought?
KB. DRAKE*

Yes, Your Honor.

Under then —

obviously because of the Bell and Lockett decisions Ohio

10

has -- now has a different death penalty.

11

time it was incumbent upon the prosecutor to allege

12

aggravated murder, in most instances felony murder, and

13

then allege and prove as an independent and discrete

14

fact that a specific aggravating circumstances, in Ohio

15

called a death penalty specification, that had to be

16

alleged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

17
18

QUESTION*

Hell, and the Ohio Court of Appeals

reversed or set aside the death sentence, did it not?

19

HR. DRAKE*

20

wholly unrelated to this case.

21

But at the

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor, on a ground

Hell, why doesn't the whole

22 question of specifications wash out at that point?

I

23

couldn't understand why the Court of Appeals for the

24

Sixth Circuit focused on these specifications and what

25

it deemed a problem with them when I thought that had
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

pretty well washed out after the Court of Appeals set

2 aside the death sentence.
3
4 argument.

HR. DRAKE:

Your Honor, that was our

We vigorously argued that point.

The Court

5 of Appeals relied on this Court’s decision in Burgett v.
e Texas, extended not only the rationale but the
7 conclusion therein that the substantive offense had to
g also be vacated.
9 the court used.

That was the summary rationale that
They did not dwell on it in any length

10 whatsoever or give any analytical reasoning for the
11 ultimate conclusion.
12

In order to prove the separate and distinct

13 factual question regarding whether or not the death
14 penalty specification was proven beyond a reasonable
15 doubt, the Ohio prosecutor introduced a certified copy
ig of the Illinois judgment entry which was proper mode
17 under Ohio law at that time.
ig

The respondent appealed his conviction to the

ig Ohio Court of Appeals.

The Court of Appeals reversed

20 the aggravated murder conviction pursuant to a state law
21 question.

Under Ohio — the Ohio law is considerably

22 different than the federal law.

In Hollin v. United

2g States this Court expressly rejected a theory that the
24 prosecution when presenting only circumstantial evidence
25 must disprove all theories consistent with innocence.
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Ohio has the more stringent doctrine whereby the Ohio

2 prosecutor must rule out beyond a reasonable doubt all

3 theories consistent with innocence.
Here the Court of Appeals' rationale was that

4

5 since the victim knew the respondent# they might have
6 had consensual intercourse prior to the homicide;

7 therefore, it wouldn't be a forcible rape.
The Court of Appeals reduced the aggravated

8

9 murder conviction to what is called simple murder in
10

Ohio.

Respondent from that point on and to this day

11

stands convicted of having purposely caused the death of

12 another.

The death penalty specification has nothing to
f

13 do with his incarceration.

He was thereafter

14 resentencei to a term of from 15 years to life
15 imprisonment.

He has not faced the specter of the death

16 penalty.
Respondent thereafter filed a petition for

17

18 writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2254 in the
19 United States District Court.

The district court

20 reviewed the record and made the following finding of
21

fact;

"From review of the record this court is

22 satisfied that an ordinary

person would have understood

23 the nature of the charges to which petitioner" —
24 respondent -- "was pleading guilty."
25

The respondent appealed to the Court of
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE , S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

That court looked at the

2 Illinois guilty plea, the actual transcript, and found
3 the

Illinois guilty plea facially invalid.

4 did not and,
5 totality of

The court

despite our urgings, refused to look at the
the circumstances regarding and surrounding

6 the entry of the Illinois guilty plea.

This Court thereafter summarily vacated and

7

8 remanded in

light of Sumner v. Mata.

Upon remand, the

9 Court of Appeals sua sponte reinstated its prior
10 judgment.

QUESTION;

Mr. Drake, did the court look at

12 anything other than

the bare transcript from Illinois

11

13

14

that we have in the record?
MR. DRAKE:

The only tangential allusion by

15 the Court of Appeals to any other facet of
16 guilty plea

the Illinois

is that the Ohio trial court did not make an

17 express finding regarding the credibility of the
18 respondent.
19

As noted in the reply brief —

20

QUESTION:

Has there a record from Illinois

21 before the court with all of the documents in it and any
22
23

written plea agreement or anything of that —
MR. DRAKE:

The three documents before the

24

court were the Illinois indictment, the Illinois

25

judgment entry, and the —
13

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. DRAKE:

Ani the transcript?
— Transcript.

And, of course,

3 the testimony and cross examination of the respondent in
4 the Ohio trial court.
5

QUESTION:

Of course, it isn't entirely

6 accurate to say that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth

7 Circuit didn't pay attention to anything except the
8 transcript of the guilty plea in Illinois.

It did

9 mention both the trial — Ohio trial court's findings on
10

that question and the Ohio Court of Appeals ' findings on

11

that question.

12

MR. DRAKE:

Your Honor, it mentioned insofar

13 as it stated them in some manner.

In Sumner v. Mata

14 this Court indicated that if the federal judiciary
15 wishes to set aside factual findings pursuant to 28
16 U.S.C. 2254(d)(8), it is incumbent upon the habeas
17 corpus applicant to allege and demonstrate by convincing
18 evidence that the Ohio trial court findings are not
19 supported by looking at the record and the statute says
20 in its entirety here there is absolute — and the Court
21

we’nt on to say that the federal court is of course free

22 to make a contrary determination, but it must articulate

23 its reasons for doing so.
24

The opinion of the court below articulates no

25 reasons whatsoever.

Upon remand the court sua sponte
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 entered the same judgment it did.

Paramount in its

2 misinterpretation was the misunderstanding of this
3 Court's decision in Henderson v. Morgan.

The court had

4 earlier cited a prophylactic rule whereby a guilty plea
5 must be more facially valid than they found this one in
g their subjective opinion.

They did not look to the fact

7 that he had competent counsel, the fact that he was
8 arraigned twice, the length of his pretrial

9 incarceration, the fact that he was more than conversant
10 both with the Illinois penal system and most assuredly
11 with the Illinois judiciary, beginning as a young —
12 well, as a juvenile and essentially working up from
13 there on.

The Illinois trial judge indicated he'd been

14 in prison approximately every two years.
15

These are the factors which surrounded the

18 entry of the guilty plea, that coupled with his own
17 personal characteristics which would be, of course, his
18 familiarity with the system, and his innate
ig intelligence, and his literacy level.
20

QUESTIONi

Mr. Drake, one thing worries me.

21 What do you want more than the record of the Illinois
22 case?

What do you want more than the record?

What else should he have listened to?

MR. DRAKE:

QUESTION:

4

MR. DRAKE:

5

He did, in fact, listen to the

respondent’s testimony.
QUESTION:

6
7

Yes, sir.

The respondent offered —

about on that point about him relying on the Illinois

8 record?

MR. DRAKE:

Your Honor, we're not

12

the plea.
QUESTION:

13
14

We believe the Ohio trial court did in

And you make no complaint about

that.
MR. DRAKE:

15

No.

We believe that the Ohio

16

trial court finding is fully supported by the record,

17

and that most assuredly the respondent has not indicated

18

that it's -- certainly not by convincing evidence that

19

that factual finding is not supported by the evidence

20 before the Ohio trial judge.

QUESTION:

21

22 mentioning it.
23
24
25

I’m at a loss as to why you keep

I guess I just missed something, that's

all.
MR. DRAKE:

The reason I mention it. Your

Honor, is because the court below refused to consider
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the very factors upon which the Ohio trial court

2 predicated its determination that that Illinois guilty
3 plea was intelligently entered.

The only reference is

4 to the transcript of the Illinois proceeding itself.
5

The court points out -- and again# it's, I

@ believe# only a one-line statement — that the Ohio
7 trial court failed to make express factual findings
0 regarding the credibility of the respondent.

That, of

9 course, has already been considered by this Court in a
-)0 different case, LaVallee v. Delle Rose.
11

The Ohio trial court, had he credited

12 respondent's testimony, he would have had no choice but
13 to dismiss the death penalty specification; that's
14 apparent from the record.

And the disagreement or the

15 statement by the court below that the Ohio trial court
10 did not make credibility findings is beyond me in light
17 of what the record was.
10

QUESTIONS

Mr. Drake, twice you've referred to

ig the Sixth Circuit as doing this sua sponte.
20 criticism there.

I detect a

A criticism of what — not having a

21 hearing or something?

What is your concern about the

22 sua sponte?
23

MR. DRAKEs

Well, Your Honor, I, as an

24 attorney, would have liked to briefed and argued the
25 case in light of this Court's decision in Sumner v.
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Mata.

It was perhaps the Bellweather decision

2 interpreting the 28 U.S.C.

2254(D).

I believe that with

3 further briefing and argument that perhaps the court
4 would not have erred to the degree I believe it did.
5

QUESTION*

I suspect on many remands from here

6 for reconsideration in light of another case the courts

7 of appeal would do precisely this.
8

MS. DRAKE;

I did not mean to be overly

9 critical of the court below, Your Honor.
10
11

In Henderson v. Morgan this Court set forth a
totality of the circumstances test wherein one judges

12 whether the accused was given adequate notice of the

13 true nature of the charges against them so as to comply
14 with due process.
15

I have elaborated upon what I believe are the

16 circumstances which fully substantiate the findings of
17 the Ohio trial court.

I would only reiterate in Sumner

18 v. Mata there is a requirement that the federal
19 judiciary — that first of all the habeas corpus
20 applicant demonstrate by convincing evidence that state
21

court findings are not fully substantiated by reference

22 to the record.

Here I believe there has not only been a

23 showing of convincing evidence, but that would be
24 impossible.
25

The court below essentially allowed the
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

respondent a presumption by looking only at the record,

2

finding it in their opinion facially defective, and

3 refusing to examine those other factors which surrounded
4

the entry of this plea.
QUESTION*

5

Mr. Drake, incidentally, is there

6 any indication in the Ohio record why the judge and the
7 prosecutor refused

to accept Lonberger's offer to

8 stipulate to the prior conviction?

ME. DRAKE*

9
10 case.

No, Your Honor.

I did not try the

There is no -QUESTION*

11

Is there any state interest

12 involved in that refusal that you can identify?

ME. DRAKE*

13

No, Your Honor.

Any

14 constitutional ramifications would have been dissipated
15 by this Court's decision in Spencer v.
16 forth in the brief,

Texas.

As set

what I believe to be a very, very

17 fine limiting instruction was given to the jury.
18 only that,

Not

but in the voir dire of this case the jury

19 assured both

convictions for the purposes of this case?
MR. DRAKE:

8
9

But you don't think there's a

I believe there's clearly a

distinction between this case and that in Burgett.

For

10

instance — assuming, for instance, that this guilty

11

plea was invalid, most assuredly Mr. Lonberger could not

12

be sentenced to death, but it should not affect the

13

validity of a murder conviction wherein the evidence is

14

overwhelming that he did in fact murder the victim in

15

this case.

16

QUESTION:

In other words, you're saying that

17

that — if it had any bearing, the status of the

18

Illinois conviction would bear only on the death penalty

19

aspect of the case and not on anything that occurred

20 after the death penalty was set aside.
21

MR. DRAKE:

Yes.

The remedial action by the

22 court should be limited or commensurate with the
23
24
25

violation perceived.

Burgett was a different case

insofar — this Court had recently decided at that time
Gideon v. Wainwright.

The Court considered that states
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

were using uncounseled guilty pleas in express violation

2 of Gideon and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

Burgett was necessary to ensure the continuing

3
4

viability of Gideon.

5

allowed to use uncounseled guilty pleas, which this

6

Court deemed to be inherently unreliable and

7

presumptively prejudicial.
The uncounseled guilty pleas considered in

States were not going to be

Burgett this Court found to be presumptively invalid,

10

i.e., facially invalid.

The prosecutor either knew or

11

should have known that he was not to be using these.

12 The Burgett decision can only be reconciled with Spencer
13

— the underpinning of Spencer is that juries both in

14 civil and here in the criminal context can and will
15 follow limiting instructions.

Juries are called on to

16 do this all the time, either in

3

harmless error argument is made, wouldn't that also have

4

been valid in the Burgett situation?

5

ME. DRAKE:

This Court apparently found that

6

the use of uncounseled convictions was so inherently

7

prejudicial that the actual — in point of fact in

8 Burgett the uncounselad convictions were never even

10
11

presented to the jury.

The judge withdrew that from the

jury's consideration at the last moment.
But only in the Gideon v. Wainwright context

12 to ensure the continuing validity in the face of
13

apparently animosity by various states to that decision

14

was such a Draconian measure deemed necessary.

15

16

the substantive offense despite overwhelming evidence of

17

guilt on that offense when limiting instructions have

18

been given outside the Gideon v. Wainwright context.

the effect of keeping this particular issue out of the

It would have put this issue

3 squarely before the jury only after they had reached a
4 decision on guilt or innocence.

And it was our position then and it remains

5

our position now that the state would suffer no

That’s correct.

And, in

That conviction statement was concededly

His position was that he understood he was entering a

that the phrase relating

Thera is no other factual information in the

Because of the harmless error?
Yes, of the harmless error

made by the state is important.

I think that the state

22 utilized his prior conviction to secure a conviction in
23 a case that was otherwise one of insubstantial
24 circumstantial evidence.

The Spencer court, — and I think it's

significant that the Spencer court, when it discussed

2 limiting instructions and the importance of limiting
3

instructions, also predicated that finding on a ruling

4

that found in Spencer that prior convictions are

5

ordinarily not inflammatory, ordinarily introduced pure

6 documentary evidence.

Mr. Czarnecki, do you think that

MR. CZARNECKI;

Yes, sir, I absolutely do.

They were both — one was six-three

in two completely opposite directions.

states# a position that I certainly agree wholeheartedly

2 with.

It then went on to suggest that states, quite

3

4 uniformly, have enacted recidivism statutes to address a
5 reoccurring problem.

Having made those two holdings, then the court

6

7 acknowledged prejudice.

I think that a fair reading of

8 Spencer must of necessity lead one to the conclusion
9 that the court acknowledged prejudice flowing to a
10 defendant from the admission of
11

prior crimes evidence.

But said that because that admission is normally not

12 inflammatory, is normally cured

by a limiting

13 instruction, that in a balance we’re going to allow that
14 procedure.

Burgett, Your Honors, is much different.

15

16 Burgett is entirely different than Spencer because
17 Burgett is -- the prior conviction in Burgett was
18 predicated upon an invalid prior conviction, and

It is a

10

distinction without a difference to suggest that Mr.

11

Longberger's conviction was reversed on appeal, and

12

therefore, his prior conviction played no part.

13

Burgett also was not sentenced as a

recidivist. Your Honor, was not convicted as a

recidivist.

I think that this Court has to directly overrule Burgett

I think that Burgett is indistinguishable.

the state — even assuming arguendo that the trial judge

— does not show a plea of guilty to attempted murder.

22

MR. CZARNECKI:

QUESTION:

That’s precisely right.

So they had the burden of going

outside the record and proving attempted murder, and
they didn’t — you could take his testimony outside the

that even if that finding is to be given deference, even

1

the judge had gone through all these specific questions,

3 "attempt with a knife", then he said, "Do you understand
4 by pleading guilty I could sentence you from one to ten
5 on aggravated battery."

Clearly, nothing ambiguous

is there?

7

MR. CZARNECKI;

8

QUESTION;

That’s correct. Your Honor.

And attempt, one to 20.

Now,

9 didn't that convey a message that the second crime that
10

the judge was talking about was the much more severe

11

crime of the two?
MR. CZARNECKI;

12

The Court’s question would

13 force me into the defendant’s mind some 11 years in the
14 past.

All I can represent to the Court —
What would you understand about

That there were two crimes, and one

20 was much more serious than the other.
21

22

Is that not what

almost anyone would understand?
MR. CZARNECKI;

But I don't believe the

23 standard, Your Honor, is what an ordinary person would
24 understand as the state presents, or what any other
25 person would understand.

Two points.

The difficulty here

respondent endeavors to assume that no

9 evidence had been presented whatsoever, which I believe
10 is Justice Stevens'
11

question — on other words, had not

Mr. Lonberger testified at the Ohio hearing — that some

12 burden would

have been foisted upon the state of Ohio to

13 validate this plea.

I would note that in Henderson versus Morgan,

14

15 it was precisely this contention by the state that
16 you’re inviting countless collateral attacks to guilty
17 pleas than the court indicated.

Moreover, even without

18 an express representation, it may be appropriate to
19 presume that in most cases, defense counsel routinely
20 explain the nature of the offense in sufficient detail

to give the accused notice of what he is being asked to

22 admit.
23

25

The burden here was by convincing evidence —
QUESTION:

Let me ask you about that.

We're

talking now about the hearing in advance of trial in the

54

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Ohio court in support of the state's motion to use the

2 prior plea to aggravate the sentence.
3

with evidence at that hearing?

4

witness?

5

MR. CZARNECKI:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CZARNECKI:

Who vent forward

Who put on the first

The respondent.

The respondent, but —
It was respondent's motion.

8 The trial court gave it —

QUESTION:

9
10

Was it a motion to prevent the

state from using it, rather than a motion for permission?
MR. CZARNECKI:

11

It was essentially a motion in

12

limiting — it was a motion to dismiss the death penalty

13

specification, but it was essentially a collateral

14

attack on that Illinois guilty plea.

15

the death penalty specification was, of course,

16

inadmissible.
QUESTION:

17

Were it no good,

Well, would you be content to take

18

the position that we can simply look at the Illinois

19-

guilty plea proceeding, and that's all the evidence you

20

need?

21

from the Henderson opinion.

22
23

On the basis of the presumption that you read

MR. CZARNECKI:

That is the presumption, but

evidence —

QUESTION:

25

credibility at all.

We don't have to get involved in

MR. CZARNECKIi

2

2UE3TIDN;

You don’t have to, but

It was an indictment that charged

3 attempted murder, and even though the judge was a little
4 imprecise in saying — just mentioning the aggravated
5 battery and the word "attempt" without ever using the
6

word "murder", the fact that the indictment mentioned

7 attempted murder and the fact that we can presume
8 counsel normally tell their clients what the charge is,

9 that's enough for your position?
MR. CZARNECKIj

10

Absent some evidence, credible

11

evidence, by the accused, yes.

12

QUESTIONi

No.

13 except what I described.

Say there was no evidence
Would you be willing to rest

14 on that?
MR. CZARNECKIi

15
16 yes.

In this particular record,

There could be guilty pleas.

But you must

17 remember, bear in mini, that this was a plea bargain.
18

QUESTION*

Then our task is limited to two

19 questions, as I see it.

Just look at the indictment and

20 find out if the man was represented by counsel.
21

that should be the test.

22

MR. CZARNECKIs

Maybe

And, of course, whether or not

23 he was arraigned and otherwise notified.

Here there are

24 additional factors that are before the Court by Mr.
25 Lonberger’s own admission, Your Honor.

56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

But in answer to your question, that is

2 correct, it would be our position that he bore the
3

burden and it's quite obvious that the Ohio trial court

4

lid not credit his testimony.

5

QUESTION*

But in Henderson, didn't they read

6 the indictment to him?
7

MR. CZARNECKI*

No, Your Honor.

That was the

8
9
10

QUESTION*

That didn't appear in the record?

MR. CZARNECKI*

That was the very pivotal in

11

— there were two issues.

12

read the indictment or otherwise notified of the charge,

13

because he was indicted for first degree murder in New

14

York and pled guilty to second degree murder.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. CZARNECKI*

17
18
19

One is that he had never been

That's right.
Therefore, he was never

arraigned on it.
And also, at the hearing, the federal district
court found, as a matter of fact, that his attorney had

20 not told him, in this particular case, that the purpose
21

was an element of the crime of second degree murder.

22

QUESTION;

That's in Henderson.

23

MR. CZARNECKI*

That coupled with his
i

24
25

intellectual deficiency made it quasi-credible.
QUESTION*

Is it clear that the indictment was

57

1

read to the defendant in this case?
MR. CZARNECKI;

2
3

despite Hr. Czarnecki's contrary —

4

QUESTION*

5

MR. CZARNECKI*

6

He pled guilty to the indictment.

QUESTION*

8

MR. CZARNECKI:

Not guilty to the indictment.
He pled guilty while

represented by competent counsel to the original charges

10 on which ha said he
11

He pled guilty to the original

charge —

7

9

He said he was arraigned,

was indicted — I'm sorry --

arraigned twice.
QUESTION:

12

Was he present when he pled not

13 guilty?
14

MR. CZARNECKI:

15 court and arraigned me.
16

QUESTION:

He said, they took me before a
It's —

What I'm trying to find out is does

17 the record show whether or not the defendant was

present

18 when the indictment was read?
19

MR. CZARNECKI;

Yes, Mr. Lonberger indicated

20 that he was present; that he was arraigned.
21

He didn't

go into any specifies or didn't delineate, did not

22 present any corroborative evidence one way or the other.
23

QUESTION;

24 four times.
25

I thought he said he went three or

He wasn't clear about any of them, was he?

Did he say he want to court three or more times?

He indicated he was arraigned

twice and that he had a hearing with the —
QUESTION*

3

Then my answer is which one of

4 these was the indictment read to him?
MB. CZAENECKI:

5

6 was ever read

He did not indicate that it

to him, is the answer.

QUESTION*

7

You don’t know.

In fact, isn’t it a little stronger

8

than that?

We do have a transcript with at least some

9

of the Illinois proceedings, and that transcript does

10 not include a reading of the indictment to the
11
12

defendant.

Is that not correct?
MB. CZAENECKI*

The transcript you have is

13 only of the guilty plea, Your Honor.
14

QUESTION*

Yes, whatever we have from

15 Illinois; we do have some transcript from Illinois.
16 That transcript does not include a reading of the
17 indictment to the defendant.
18

ME. CZAENECKI*

That's correct, Your Honor.
