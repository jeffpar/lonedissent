CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER-.

Mr. Koppe, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP M. KOPPE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

7

MR. KOPPE:

8
9
10

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This case represents the culmination of a

11

six-year struggle by the State of Missouri to enforce

12

the multiple punishment provisions of Missouri's armed

13

criminal action statute, a statute which makes it a

14

separate offense punishable by a separate sentence to

15

commit a felony with the use, aid or assistance of a

16

dangerous or deadly weapon.

17

For the last three years, anyway, it has been

18

an uphill battle.

In a series of decisions beginning in

19

January of 1980, the Missouri Supreme Court has ruled

20

that the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,

21

applicable to the states through the Fourteenth

22

Amendment, insofar as it prohibits multiple punishments

23

for the same offense, prevents the state from convicting

24

a defendant for both armed criminal action and the

25

predicate or underlying felony.

The court reached its

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

conclusion even though it also concluded that the

2

legislature intended multiple punishments under both

3

statutes and even though those punishments were assessed

4

in a single proceeding.

5

Twice this Court has directed the Missouri

6

Supreme Court to reconsider these rulings, first in

7

light of Whalen versus United States, then again in

8

light of Albernaz versus the Government.

9

occasions, however, the Missouri Supreme Court declined

On both

10

to take advantage of the opportunity to change its

11

ruling.

12

As the result of the Missouri Supreme Court's

13

adherence to what we regard as an erroneous conclusion,

14

the Missouri Court of Appeals in this case reversed the

15

Respondent's 15-year concurrent sentence for armed

16

criminal action, leaving intact a concurrent 10-year

17

sentence for the predicate felony, which was robbery in

18

the first degree.

19

not involved in this case was a consecutive five-year

20

sentence that the Respondent received pursuant to an

21

assault conviction arising out of the same transaction.

22

Unaffected by the court's holding and

The issue presented by this case, then, is

23

strictly a legal one, devoid of any procedural

24

complexities or factual disputes.

25

simply whether or not the State, without offending the

And that question is

double jeopardy clause, may impose cumulative

2

punishments for conduct arising from the same act or

3

transaction for both a compound or greater offense, in

4

this case armed criminal action, and also the predicate

5

or lesser included offense, in this case robbery in the

6

first degree.
QUESTIONS

7

Mr. Koppe, has your Supreme Court

8

ever addressed that question under the state

9

constitution?
MR. KOPPEi

10

The court did, Your Honors, and it

11

found that the state prohibition against double jeopardy

12

prohibited only retrial after acquittal.

13

was decided solely on the basis of federal

14

constitutional grounds.
QUESTION;

15

Is that case you referred to a

You don •t

The Court of Appeals did

16

not treat this issue with any degree of specificity.

17

simply cited the two Sours cases and the Haggard cases,

18

the cases that were decided by the Missouri Supreme

Court en banc.

20

It

It felt it was bound by those cases.

So in order to fully understand the reasoning

21

behind the Supreme Court's decisions, you must look to

22

Sours I and II, a case called State versus Haggard,

23

where the court reconsidered this issue following

24

Albernaz, and most recently in a case called State

25

versus Kane, all of which are cited in our brief.

5

und erlying felony,

of the compound offense, that that is prohi bited by the

wit hin the meaning of Block-burger.

9

They basically state that since the legislature,

According to the Missouri Supreme Court, when

10

you apply the Blockburger test you come up short,

QUESTION;

Mr. Koppe, your Court of Appeals

sen tences, didn't they?

16

MR. KOPPE;

QUESTION:

19

Is the re anything in state law that

compels that result, rather than vacati ng the sh orte r?

1

Court indicatad that the reason it would vacate the

2

armed criminal action conviction was because what the

3

state legislature had attempted to do was pass an

4

enhancement statute.

5

the enhancement failed because of the way the statute

6

was phrased, and the court expressly said that in Kane.

7

However, the court reasoned that

And I think that case illustrates more than

8

anything precisely what this case is about.

9

really arguing constitutional principles in any real

We're not

10

sense; we're arguing phraseology.

11

State's position here is that the State of Missouri

12

could have done precisely the same thing, assessed

13

precisely the same punishment in a single statute —

The issue is whether they can set

3

That's correct, on federal double

QUESTION;

But he cites two state cases,

right?

9

MR. KOPPE;

That's correct.

Basi cally, the

10

Cou rt of Appeals felt bound by the earlier decisions of

11

the Missouri Supreme Court, which we cite a nd discuss in

12

our brief.

13

and State versus Haggard.

14

really the basis for the reversal, you have to look at

15

those cases.

16

Those are Sours versus State, t wo opinions,
So in order to d etermine

And essentially --

QUESTION;

May I ask, you said th at in one of

17

those earlier cases, not Sours but the othe r one, I

18

think it was, that the Supreme Court of Mis souri said

19

that the legislature had attempted to enact an

20

enhancement statute.

ME.

KOPPE;

22

QUESTIONi

That's correct.
Which is certainly the way I would

23

have read it, very frankly.

But it failed because of

24

the language of the statute.

was simply an enhancement statute, rather t han to create

a second offense

2

HR. HOPPE:

Correct.

What the court said, and

3

I know I’ve cited it in my brief, but basically, when

4

explaining why they were vacating what they had held to

5

be the greater offense, was that the attempted

6

enhancement which they had tried failed because of its

7

phraseology or the way it was phrased.

8

make that statement, and I think that that to me

9

demonstrates an illustration of again what this case

They expressly

10

really hinges on.

11

argument is that the State in this case could have

12

passed a single statute and assessed exactly the same

13

punishment for this particular conduct.

14

It hinges on phraseology, because our

And the Missouri Supreme Court in effect so

15

held.

16

Kane case that there was nothing unconstitutional with

17

giving the defendant an additional amount of punishment

18

because of his use of a weapon to commit a crime.

19

However —

20

The Missouri Supreme Court flatly stated in the

QUESTION:

But we are bound by their

21

interpretation of their own statute, n amely that the

22

legislature didn’t pass an enhancement statute, they

23

passed a statute which imposed a separ ate penalty for a

24

separate crime.

25

legislature did.

That's what they cone luded the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

HR. KOPPE:

Well, when they concluded that,

2

Your Honor, you have to look at the cases they

3

discussed, and they discussed the two types of cases.

4

There are cases, for example, emanating from states like

5

Delaware, Michigan, Maryland, of which this Court is

6

aware, which also make it a separate offense.

7

Then there are other states which have simply

8

added punishment to the sentence for the particular

9

felony involved, and the court considered that the

10

latter type of statutes was the true enhancement

11

statute.

12

QUESTION:

But you're urging us to say that

13

not only may the legislature pass an enhancement

14

statute, but it may do exactly what the Supreme Court of

15

Missouri said it did and said it couldn't, namely impose

16

a separate penalty.

17

MR. KOPPE:

18

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the reason -Aren't you saying that the double

19

jeopardy clause does not prevent a legislature from

20

doing that?

21

MR. KOPPE:

That's correct, that’s correct.

22

And simply what the Supreme Court was saying was, what

23

the Missouri Supreme Court was saying is, if the state

24

legislature had done it in a slightly different fashion,

25

if it had taken all the punishment and put it in a

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

single sentence

2

wouldn't have been a constitutional violation.

3

we're saying is, if they had put all the punishment in a

4

single sentence it certainly would have been a less

5

roundabout way of doing it, but the fact that they chose

6

to do it in separate statutes raises no -- or shouldn't

7

raise a constitutional guestion .

excuse me, a single statute

there
And what

8

Now, it does because they held that the double

9

jeopardy clause prohibited the legislature in this state

10

from doing it in this fashion.

11

in his brief, counsel for the Respondent in this case

12

basically says that the role of the double jeopardy

13

clause in single prosecution cases prevents a state

14

legislature or Congress from assessing punishment over

15

two statutes, that it has to do with the distribution of

16

punishments.

17

And in arguing the point

Ani that is essentially what the case is

18

really about.

19

said it in that fashion, but that's really what their

20

decision comes down to.

21

basically is that this is simply a matter of form over

22

substance, that this really doesn't raise any

23

significant constitutional issue, because the sole

24

question here is one of legislative intent.

25

iJe

The Missouri Supreme Court never actually

1

prosecution case.

2

where the State had attempted not only to assess

3

multiple punishments under two statutes but to impose

4

those statutes in two separate proceedings, then you

5

would have an altogether lifferent issue.

6

would have a Harris versus Oklahoma problem, Illinois

7

versus Vitale, a Brown versus Ohio.

8
9

If we were dealing with a situation

Then you

But in this case the question is what is the
role of the double jeopardy clause insofar as it

10

prohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.

11

And of course we felt that the issue was resolved, had

12

been resolved once and for all in Albernaz versus United

13

States, where this Court in its last two sentences of

14

the opinion sayss

15

constitutionally permissible" -- talking about the

16

prohibition against multiple punishments for the same

17

offense -- "The question of what punishments are

18

constitutionally permissible is not different from the

19

question of what punishment the legislative branch

20

intended to be imposed.

21

did here, to impose multiple punishment, imposition of

22

such sentences does not violate the Constitution.”

23

"The question of what punishment are

Where Congress intended, as it

Now, the Missouri Supreme Court on remand in

24

State versus Haggard seemed to indicate that these

25

sentences, if they meant what they said and if binding

on the court, would prevent the vacation of the armed

2

criminal action statute.

3

was, this is dicta, we don't have to follow this

4

opinion.

5

Put essentially what they said

Now, of course, the Delaware Supreme Court on

6

remand in a similar case also felt it was dicta, but

7

also thought that it was an evolving rule that it was

8

therefore obligated or should follow.

9

Our argument of course is that it is not dicta

10

and, notwithstanding the concurrence in the case which

11

said that this statement was not supported by either

12

precedent or logic, we think it's supported by both.

13

be sure, I think the opinions of this Court indicate

14

that in the double jeopardy area -- in some of its

15

opinions I think it’s been described as not exactly

being a model of clarity.

But nevertheless, this Court in Whalen and

again in Albernaz for really the first time took some

25

time to attempt to explicate the rationale that

underlies the double jeopardy clause in sin gle

basically is that where a defendant is tried and

incidents, the defendant cannot be then tried again for

a crime which contains one of those incidents.

QUESTION;

MR.

Yes.
Where it is possible at the

original proceeding to charge him with both -- and of

There would be two trials.
But then so your rule isn't limited

to multiple punishments for single trials.

MR. KOPPE:

exceptions to the Brown rule.

10

In other words, there are

In those cases you would agree that

11

for the same offense there can be successive

12

prosecutions ?
MR. KOPPE:

13

Correct, that would be our

position.

However, the chances of that happening it

seems to me would be very rare.

MR. KOPPE:

QUESTION:

19

MR. KOPPE:

Why?
I'm not aware of its happening.
Why would they be rare?
But regardless / that’s correct.

20

In other words, we're not asking for immunity from the

21

successive prosecution rule in Brown, but Brown does

22

admit of some exceptions.

23

QUESTION:

That's all we're saying.

You're only asking for the immunity

24

from that rule where one of the convictions for the same

accomplish -- anything that you can accomplish in two

imposed here, it would be whether or not the total

And so if there’s

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

about direct punishment or collateral conse guences,

2

whether that punishment would be excessive or whether

3

that punishment would be cruel and unusual.

4

But this -- you know, that involv es some other

5

provision of the Constitution, the Eight Am endment.

6

That is not the Fifth Amendment.

7

basically that when you're talking about th e Fifth

8

Amendment in single prosecution cases that the role of

the double jeopardy clause acts as a restra int on courts

Cur argum ent is

10

and prosecutors and protects a defendant ag ainst

11

receiving more punishment than what the leg islative

12

branch intended he receive.

13

Now, when we made this argument i n the Supreme

14

Court basically what they said,

15

that, well, you have created a rule which h as immunized

16

the legislative branch from the double jeop ardy clause,

17

And we think really that that begs the ques tion, because

18

if the protection, as we argue, is designed to ensure

19

that a defendant does not receive more puni shment than

20

what the legislature imposed, it really doe sn ' t make any

21

sense to say, well, you've immunized the le gislature

22

from the scope of the clause, because basic ally what

23

we've said is that the clause is designed t o protect a

24

defendant from courts and prosecutorial ove rrea ching.

Well, I was trying to make one

MR. KOPPE:

Please.
What I was starting to say was,

7

not only does the statute, the armed criminal action

to, but it has been construed in that fashion at least

10
11

on four occasions by the Missouri Supreme Court.
Now, with respect to your question, again

12

getting back to the Court of Appeals' opinion, the Court

13

of Appeals' authority was state cases, but those state

14

cases, the two Sours cases and the Haggard cases, were

15

decided solely on federal constitutional grounds.

16

what I am saying is, in order to determine exactly what

17

the federal question was you need to look at these

18

cases, these two Sours cases and the Haggard cases.

19

And

Obviously, if you look no farther than the

The question, however, is can the state

10

QUESTIONi

May I ask you another question

11

about that.

I guess the language that troubles the

12

Missouri Supreme Court is the language, "is also guilty

13

of the crime of armed criminal action, and upon

14

conviction" and so forth.

15

it would be clearly just an enhancement statute.

If they took those words out

And you mentioned the difficulty of six years

16
17

of straightening out the Supreme Court.

18

why you didn't go back to the legislature and say, all

1

you have to do is strike three or four words out of this

20

statute and our problem is solved, because it's

21

perfectly clear that an enhancement statute is

22

constitutionally unobjectionable.
MR. KOPPE:

I just wonder

Well, in the first instance, it is

our position that in a sense it is an enhancement

statute.

MR. KOPPEi

That’s the whole point.

If you

3

said, well,

4

didn't have in excess of 100 cases where the defendants

5

lost their armed criminal action convictions, in a sense

6

it really wouldn’t be that big of an impact.

7

remains, however, that this statute has been in effect

8

for some six years and, as this Court knows from simply

9

the cases that are presently pending in certiorari --

10

what would be the impact, I mean, if we

QUESTION

The fact

Of course, the funny thing about

11

this case is that without the enhancement you have a

12

life sentence available to the trial judge anyway.

13

this particular case you didn’t even need the

14

enhancement statute.

15

MR. KOPPEi

16

In

That’s true.
It's sort of a tempest in a

MR. KOPPE;

18

find if in fact the court had

19

vacated the ten-year sentence, there wouldn’t have been

20

a problem.

21

QUESTION;

They could have done that

22

consistently with the Missouri court's understanding of

23

the federal Constitution, even if that may be wrong.

24
25

MR. KOPPE;

That's correct, that's correct.

But again, what it comes down to and what we’re saying

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

is, admittedly if the legislature had done this a littie

2

different way there wouldn’t have been this problem

3

wouldn’t be here; this Court would be listening to

4

another case.

5

The fact remains,

we

the legislature did it this

6

way, and so the question is whether in single

7

prosecution cases the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition

8

against multiple pun ishmen t s serves as some literary

9

critique on how the legislature chose to enact the

10

enhancement statute,

11

this is an enhancement statute,

12

in the way that you would normally think of as an

13

enh ancement statute, but it accomplishes precisely the

14

sam e thing.

15

have accomplished in a single statute.

16

In other words, we’re saying that
It may not be fashioned

It accomplishes no more than they could

QUESTION;

But the other side of that same

17

argument is, i f one construed the Blockburger rule in

18

the old-fashio ned way -- and I understand that the

19

Albernaz case supports you very strongly — and said,

20

well, you just make it an enhan cement statute when you

21

do, that rule of law would have provided no obstacle to

the trial judg e giving this man a life sentence, no

want

2

MR. KQPPEs

3

QUESTION*

Right.
So the constitutional rule is no

4

problem, except when they draft a kind of a strange

5

statute like this.

6

MR. KOPPE;

Right.

And of course, at the time

7

the statute was enacted I think the legislators, if they

8

considered this question at all, thought that the

9

Blockburger rule had been satisfied because in the

10

abstract, in the abstract -- and I think Justice

11

Rehnquist's opinion in Whalen goes into great detail on

12

this — in the abstract it does satisfy the test.

13

However, as applied in any given situation,

14

obviously whatever felony you prove up is not going to

15

require any additional elements.

16

as in Whalen, for example, which involved felony murder

17

and I think a rape, the underlying felony did not have

18

to be rape.

19

likewise, the homicide didn't require a rape.

20

But in the abstract,

It could have been something else.

And

Bo in the abstract it did meet the statute,

21

and of course that's what the Missouri Supreme Court

22

said at first, and then they basically altered their

23

method of applying the Blockburger rule.

24

saying is that the Blockburger rule is, as this Court

25

said it was in Ianelli, in Whalen and in Albernaz.

But what we're

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

In

1

single prosecution cases, anyway, it's simply a rule to

2

define legislative intent.

3

And basically what we're saying is, it can’t

4

be both.

It can't on the one hand be a rule — not

5

consistently.

6

seeks to ascertain legislative intent and then, when it

7

finds it, turns it inside out and defeats that intent.

8

And of course, that's what the Supreme Court of Missouri

9

used Blockburger for.

It can't on the one hand be a rule which

It applied Blockburger not as

10

rule of statutory construction, but as a constitutional

11

litmus test.

12

QUESTION :

Wh en you emphasize what you call

13

the clarity of the intent of the Missouri 1egislature

14

you are aiming, I take it, a t the opening left in

15

Whalen, where the Court said, "In the absence of a clear

16

indication of contrary legislative intent."

17

there is a clear indication of contrary legislative

18

intent here.

19

MR. KOPPEi

Right.

And you say

And there's also a

20

statement in Whalen that we rely on which says, in

21

discussing the Blockburger test, after stating that it

22

is a rule of statutory construction, it says, and where

23

the offenses are the same under that test -- and that's

24

what the Missouri Supreme Court said here -- where they

25

are the same, cumulative sentences are not permitted

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

unless elsewhere specifically authorized by Congress.

2

Well, you substitute the words "state

3

legislature" for "Congress," and again that holding

4

supports us in its entirety.

5

Supreme Court elected not to follow that particular

6

language on the belief that the conclusion urged by the

7

state would mean that the conclusion urged by the state

8

would mean that the legislature would have been

9

immunized from the scope ‘of the double jeopardy clause.

10

And that we say really begs the question.

QUESTION;

Under your view would you concede,

then, that the legislature could enact sentence
enhancement provisions for a single conviction?
MR. GARDNER;

Yes, it could.

The Missouri General Assembly's intent in
enacting the armed criminal action was to authorize the
imposition of punishment, the imposition of additional
punishment for the use of a weapon to commit a felony.
The Missouri Supreme Court recognized that intent, it
recognized the wisdom of that intent.

But it directed

the General Assembly how to constitutionally carry out
that intent.

Right.
The Blockburger test is a rule

of constitutional magnitude which prohibits the
imposition of punishment under two statutes that are the

It

11

is not solely a rule of statutory construction which,

12

because it serves the discerned legislative intent, may

be overcome by a clear indication of a contrary

14

legislative intent.
It is both a rule of constitutional magnitude

and a rule of statutory construction, but in its role as

a rule of statutocy construction it is secondary to and

derivative from the constitutional magnitude rule.

MR. GARDNER;

Only in a certain very limited

MR. KOPPE;

Well, just one thing I lii mean to

add, and that simply is I think, as I argued in my

opening remarks, this issue is simply a case of form

10

over substance, and I think the punishments assessed in

11

this case illustrate this better than anything else.

12

Basically, what the Respondent says is that the double

13

jeopardy clause as applied to single prosecution cases

14

prevents the legislature from distributing punishment it

15

might otherwise have assessed over two statutes.
Now, what possible rationale could there be

16
17

for that?

18

legislature had done the statute the way the Missouri

19

Supreme Court says they should have, what they would

20

have done was allowed the assessment of an additional

21

term of years onto the original robbery sentence.

they had accomplished that, what the Defendant would

have received was a ten-year sentence for robbery,
