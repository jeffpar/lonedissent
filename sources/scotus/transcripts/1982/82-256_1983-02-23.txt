Mr. Solicitor General, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS J. CARUSO, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. CARUSO:

5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

6

Court.

This case involves the validity of a warrantless search of

7

the Respondent and the auto passenger part of the automobile under

8

his control and possession prior to his arrest for possession of

9

marijuana and of the automobile trunk after his arrest.
The two deputy sheriffs were driving south on a country

10
11

road in a rural area at midnight and the car that the sheriffs

12

were driving was passed by another automobile going in the

13

opposite direction and was clocked by a radar device at 71 miles

14

an hour in a 55 mile hour zone.
The car was pursued by the two deputy sheriffs with

15
16

pursuit.

17

vehicle for approximately five or ten minutes.

18

tail lights go left off of the road that they were on and as they

19

made the turn left to follow the car they found the car in the

20

ditch.

21

was sticking out over the portion of the traveled road.

22
23
24
25

In about five or ten minutes they lost sight of the
They did notice the

The front end of the car was in the ditch.

The rear end

The entire incident lasted about five minutes.

There

was no other traffic that was noticed in the area.
The police car approached the car in the ditch on the
passenger side and they saw Respondent seated in the driver's

1

side of the automobile behind the wheel and was the only

2

occupant.
Respondent exited the automobile, leaving the driver's

3
4

side door wide open with the dome light on, and met the two

5

police officers at the rear of the automobile.

6

one of the deputies asked Respondent for his driver's license.

7

The deputy did not — The Respondent did not respond.

8

say a word, he stared, and he was asked a second time by the

9

deputy to produce his driver's license.

At that time

He didn't

After a few seconds

10

he reached in his wallet on his person and produced a driver's

11

license.

12

Secondly, the deputy sheriff asked Respondent for

13

the certificate of registration and this is required to be

14

produced on demand under the Michigan Vehicle Code.

15

was no response and a few moments of staring and the second time

he was asked for the registration.

21

plain view on the floorboard on the driver's side next to the

22

door that was open and in front of the front seat of the car.

23

At the time they approached

Upon seeing that knife, the deputy sheriff, one of

24

the deputies, said, hold it, and he was then moved toward the

25

rear of the car at the side window and with his hands on the

2

The other deputy at that point in time looked into the

3

car.

in the interior of the car and as he did that he noticed the arm­

He noticed something protruding from underneath the armrest.

At that point in time, he knelt in and again examined it more

closely and he flipped up one side of the armrest.

He did not enter it.

He took his flashlight and he flashed

an armrest, divided in half.

As he flipped

he noticed that this was a

10

pouch of a sort that was open.

11

a light on the object and on more close examination he noticed

12

that there was a plastic baggie sticking out of the pouch and

13

out of the plastic baggie in full view, without touching it,

14

he noticed a substance that appeared to him to be marijuana.

15

He did not touch it.

He flashed

At that point in time, he picked up the pouch.

He

16

felt it with his hands and he felt another hard object in that

pouch.

powdery substance and there was a pill of some sort that was

19

wrapped up in tinfoil.

He opened it up and he noticed that the bottle had a

arresting you for grass, for possession of marijuana.

QUESTION:

23

MR. CARUSO:

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Caruso —
Yes.
Do you think that the officers could have

arrested the Defendant in this case for speeding or for driving
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

while intoxicated or perhaps even for carrying the weapon which

2

they found?

3
4

MR. CARUSO:

I believe that at that time a violation

of Michigan Vehicle Code for speeding —

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CARUSO:

Before all this search occurred?
Yes.

He could have been arrested.

There

7

could have been a custodial arrest because violation of speed

8

limit is a misdemeanor.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

But, it is your position or you would concede

that that did not occur?
MR. CARUSO:

That did not occur.

As a matter of

12

practice, they do not arrest for speeding violations unless it

13

is something more in addition to —

14
15
16

QUESTION:

How about driving while intoxicated?

don't take somebody into custody for that?
MR. CARUSO:

Well, they would have to go through a

17

process to make a determination as to whether the party is

18

intoxicated and then go from that point.

19

They

But, at this particular point in time, they didn't

20

know really what they had.

21

They had an unresponsive individual who appeared to be under

22

the influence of something and they wanted to determine whether

23

the registration to the vehicle was in the car or on his person

24

as required by the Motor Vehicle Code.

25

They noticed a car in the ditch.

At the time they patted him down, at the time that
6

the saw the large knife, they picked up and they found the pouch

2

and this sort of thing, they charged him and they arrested him

3

and then they asked for the key, because of the deputies who

4

looked inside had noticed that the car was in the lock position,

5

the driving mechanism, and there wasn't any key in the ignition,

6

did give one key and then he said at that time, the Respondent,

7

that he did not have a key to the trunk.

8
9

So, the deputy walked around back of the trunk and he
noticed when he looked at the lock of the trunk the lock had

10

been punched out, there wasn't any lock there.

11

open up the trunk by simply inserting a small penknife that

12

triggered the mechanism and opened up the trunk. And, when he

13

looked in the truck, he found two large sacks and they were

14

split open, it was a large sack split open into two sections which

15

appeared to him to contain again marijuana, later found out to

16

be about 70 to 75 pounds of contraband marijuana.

He was able to

17

At that time they patted him down a second time, they

18

handcuffed him and took him back to the cruiser and called in a

19

wrecker to have the car towed into the Sheriff's Department to

20

secure the vehicle and to bring the Respondent to jail.

21

Now, it is our position, the State's position here,

22

that the frisk of Respondent and the interior of the automobile

23

under these circumstances is justified by the rationale of

24

Terry v. Ohio.

25

privacy rights of an individual for the protection of police

Although Terry allowed an encroachment on the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Ee

1

officers, the frisk in Terry was for weapons that was — and

2

was confined to the pat down of the individual's outer clothing.

3

Here, the search for weapons was not limited to the frisk of

4

Respondent but extended into the passenger part of the automobile.

5

And, as stated in Adams v. Williams, the whole purpose of the

6

Terry search is not to discover evidence of crime but rather

7

to allow a police officer to conduct an investigation without

8

fear of personal injury.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Caruso, would you address the question

10

of whether there is an adequate and independent state ground

11

in this case?

12

higher standard for illegal search and seizure cases than the

13

Federal Constitution would require.

14

There is some indication that Michigan imposes a

MR. CARUSO:

The Supreme Court in its decision that

15

reversed the Court of Appeals made a reference to Article 1, Section

16

11

17

any time in the opinion.

18

of the 4th Amendment.

19

20

of

the Michigan Constituion, but did not discuss it at
The decision was made on the basis

So, I would say in chief they discussed only federal
cases dealing with the 4th Amendment.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CARUSO:

23

QUESTION:

Well, they cited the Michigan Constitution.
They did cite the Michigan —
And the cases and statutes in Michigan and

24

the Michigan Constitution, in fact, require a higher standard

25

in this circumstance than would be required by the Federal
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

i

1

Constitution?

2

MR. CARUSO:

In People v. Moore, a Michigan case, it

3

was held that the particular clause in the Michigan Constitution

4

which permits the introduction into evidence of evidence found that LS

5

not subject to the strict requirement of reasonable search and

6

seizure is inconsistent with the 4th Amendment of the United

7

States Constitution and, therefore, it doesn't obtain and it

8

doesn't endure.

9

So, in this particular case, it was not decided on

10

the basis of that clause in the Michigan Constitution which

11

permits a greater latitude in the search for evidence in con­

12

nection with narcotics or from an automobile.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I am not sure I understand your

answer.

the Federal Constitution?

Yes, it would.

Yes, it would allow a Terry type search.

Yes, it would.
And you base that on what?
I base that on the proposition that the

Michigan case law with reference to the reasonableness of a

1

search really relates to the 4th Amendment of the Constitution.

2

And repeatedly these cases that have permitted searches of this

3

type have relied upon the Terry rationale.

4

QUESTION:

May I ask you if you are familiar with the

case of People against

7

MR. CARUSO:

Secrest,

a 1982 Michigan case which

I am not that familiar with it, no, Mr.

Justice.

9

QUESTION:

Do you have an explaination of why in this

10

Court, in this particular case, the Michigan Court specifically

11

said it relied on the Michigan Constitution if it didn't mean

12

that?

13
14

MR. CARUSO:

I think it was just simply — just added

to it as just an afterthought.

15

QUESTION:

They didn't discuss it.

Well, didn't Justice Coleman in her dissent

also say there was no violation of Michigan Constitution in her

view?

19

She thought it necessary to address the Michigan

MR. CARUSO:

Well, she did find that there is not

20

necessarily any violation of the Michigan Constitution, but just

21

a statement in that sense and then the majority opinion that

22

reversed the Court of Appeals did not really discuss the

23

Michigan Constitution.

United States Constitution.

It simply relied on all of the cases,

the violation of the Michigan Constitution.

3

MR. CARUSO:

QUESTION:

Yes, Mr. Justice, it did.
And, is it not true that the text of the

5

Michigan Constitution provision is rather different from the

6

text of the 4th Amendent?

7

MR. CARUSO:

There is a clause added to that that is

8

totally different than the 4th Amendment, yes, Mr. Justice, that

is correct.

automobile.

QUESTION:

What about Belton and Robbins and the cases

that came after this case was decided?

18

MR. CARUSO:

Well, in those cases I don't recall that

that really involved a protective search for the benefit of

police officers.

It sure did.

Oh, the examination of the trunk.
Once this car was stopped, he was ultimately

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

arrested, was he not?

2

MR. CARUSO:

Yes.

Forgetting the interior of the car

3

and confining to the search of the trunk after arrest, I would

4

say that today it would governed by probable cause search based

5

on Ross and based on Michigan v. Thomas and also based upon the

6

Belton case, a search incident to arrest.

7

In this case, we relied on it, as indicated by the

8

question presented in the brief, upon the rationale of Opperman.

9

But, any one of those cases would apply to the trunk search

10

today.

There isn't any question about it in my opinion.

11

But, here, confining my remarks for the moment to the

12

search of the interior of the car after the knife was found, is

13

based upon the Terry rationale, if you please.

14

rationale had to do with an investigatory, a legitimate

15

investigatory search, and the police officer in this case had

16

found himself in a legitimate, confrontive, investigative

17

search for speeding and for a car in the ditch.

18

The Terry

And, the Petitioner suggests, considering the totality

19

of the facts, that it was at night time, in a rural area, an

20

unresponsive individual who would not respond, who made a move

21

toward the open door of the car and found — And there was a

22

knife in plain view.

24

a concern in these two police officers.

I think that all of these factors gave

these people have testified — It is very clear from the record

5

that they were concerned at all times during the course of the

so-called,on-going investigation.

7

The other had had some
And both of

And, as I submit, the patting down of Respondent and

8

then taking that search from Respondent into the car under these

9

facts and circumstances is part and parcel of a continuous

10

investigation in one incident.

11

In addition to that, the reason the police officer

12

indicated that he wanted to go into the car to examine the

13

interior of the car, he had not yet received the certificate

14

of registration.

15

into the car — he testified to that — to get that registration

16

of the automobile even after he had found the knife and secured

17

the knife.

18

further weapons so that Respondent could go back into the car

19

to see if he could produce that certificate of registration.

20

But, of course, at that point in time, they lifted the armrest,,

21

they found the marijuana and the arrest was made on that basis.

They were looking — The officer was looking only

2

for weapons because he intended to let Respondent back into the

3

car.
Now, insofar as the case law on this is concerned, in

4
5

Pennsylvania v. Mimms this Court gave recognition to the great

6

danger that surrounds an investigative stop by a police officer

7

to the extent that he is permitted to order the driver out of

8

the car.

9

a driver out of the car, it is for safety purposes and, of course,

And, if a person orders — If a police officer orders

if nothing is wrong, then he goes back into the car.

11

there are Terry factors that come into being as in this case,

QUESTION:

May I ask you, Mr. Solicitor General, one

13

other question about our jurisdiction?

14

against

15

that the State Constitution imposes a higher standard of

16

protection than does the Federal Constitution and that the

17

federal cases are merely instructive in analyzing.

a correct statement of Michigan law, do you think we have

19

jurisdiction of this appeal?

20

The case of the People

Secrest that I asked you about earlier says in words

MR. CARUSO:

If that is

Yes, I do believe that you have juris­

21

diction under this — in this case simply because the Court

22

did apply down below, and the Court did apply in the Court of

23

Appeals the 4th Amendment and the case law, the U.S. case law,

24

pursuant under the 4th Amendment with reference thereto; to wit,

25

specifically the Terry case.

QUESTION:

You say that is true even if Michigan

imposes a tougher standard than the Federal —
MR. CARUSO:

Even if Michigan imposes a tougher

standard, yes.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose the Court had started out

6

and said we are going — we are interested in deciding whether

7

there was an illegal search under the Michigan Constitution and th£n

8

said it might help us to decided that by talking about the

9

federal law and they went through exactly the same discussion

10

of the federal law and then said, as they said, we therefore

11

conclude that the search violated the 4th Amendment and the

12

Michigan Constitution?

13

MR. CARUSO:

Well, under the decision — I believe it is

14

Delaware v. Prouse.

15

here before the Court even though it could have been decided

16

on the State Constitution.

17

Constitution and the Court retained jurisdiction of that matter.

18

I believe that we had a similar circumstance

QUESTION:

It was also decided on the Federal

Yes, but suppose-it is clear that the state, £s

19

Justice Stevens suggests, doesn't necessarily follow — in

20

applying its own constitution doesn't necessary follow or feel

21

compelled by the federal rulings, have their own view of their

22

own constitution?

23

That wasn't the case in Delaware.

MR. CARUSO:

I don't believe it was the case here,

24

Your Honor, Mr. Justice.

25

they really applied the 4th Amendment.

I think in this case what they did,

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Now, insofar as the 4th Amendment of the U.S.

2

Constitution and the Michigan Constitution, they are almost

3

identical in content except for that final clause and it says

4

"the provision of this section shall not be construed to bar

5

from evidence in any criminal proceedings any narcotic drug,

6

firearm, bomb, explosive, or any other dangerous weapon seized

7

by a peace officer outside the curtilage of any dwelling house

8

in this state."

9

And this provision, our courts have said, matched

10

against the 4th Amendment, has no effect.

1

The Court specifically did not inquire into the factors that

2

Respondent and the Michigan Supreme Court would apparently make

3

decisive here, such factors as the precise positioning of the

4

officers and the suspects at the scene or whether there were

5

alternative means available that the officer might have used to

control the suspect.

8

QUESTION:

Well, the Belton — That Belton rule doesn't

accrue until there has been an arrest.

9

MR. STRAUSS:

That is right.

It deals with searches

10

incident to arrest, Justice, White, and this case only involves

11

the protective search for weapons incident to a Terry stop.

12

QUESTION:

But, if this gentleman had tried to walk away

13

shortly after the police got there but before there was anything

14

said about an arrest, what would have happened to him in your view

15
16

MR. STRAUSS:

he would not have allowed him to walk away.

17
18

The officer testified, I believe, that

QUESTION:

So that under what we have said many times,

if he can't walk away, he is under arrest.

19

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, he is not necessarily under arrest.

20

In this case I think we very clearly have a stop as opposed to

21

an arrest.

22

under arrest until he had seen the marijuana.

23

The officer also testified they did not place him

But, in many ways, a stop in which a suspect is not

24

placed under arrest and in which the officers are often at the

25

scene with a suspect for an extended period to question him is
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

an even more volatile and dangerous situation for an officer

2

than one in which a suspect has been fully subdued and arrested.

3

QUESTION:

The search of the trunk came some significant

4

time after the bag of marijuana was discovered on the front seat,

5

is that not so?

6

MR. STRAUSS:

That is right.

The search of the trunk

7

followed the discovery of the marijuana and the arrest.

8

the search of the trunk, in our view, could have been justified

9

under Belton as a search incident to arrest.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. STRAUSS:

And,

I thought Belton was passenger compartment.
It was Justice Rehnquist, but in this

case we have an unlocked trunk.
QUESTION:

So you say that can be treated like the

passenger —
MR. STRAUSS:

At least as accessible to the suspect

16

as the passenger compartment.

QUESTION:

Assume they discovered the marijuane in

18

the passenger compartment and they arrest.

probable cause to search the entire car?

QUESTION:

Under — Not necessarily under Belton.

If under Ross would give probable cause

to search the entire car.

They could at that point searched the

to arrest under Belton.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes.
But, the initial discovery of the

5

marijuana was the result of what one might call a car frisk,

6

a search for weapons only in the car.

QUESTION:

8

MR. STRAUSS:

9

right.

But after that it was no frisk?
Once the found the marijuana that is

They placed him under arrest.

MR. STRAUSS:

12

QUESTION:

And he could have hurt whom then?

13

QUESTION:

They did.

14

MR. STRAUSS:

15

QUESTION:

They could have handcuffed him?
That is right.

In fact, they did at some point and —

They could have done it before they searched

16

the trunk and they wouldn't have had to search the trunk to find

17

whether there were weapons in it.

18

MR. STRAUSS:

That is right.

The search — No one,

19

as far as I know, Justice Marshall, defends the trunk search

20

as a car frisk, as a search for weapons.

21

incident to arrest or arguably a probable cause search, at least

22

a search incident to arrest under Belton hecause he was under

23

arrest at that point.

24
25

QUESTION:

That is a search

The difference in the Belton case as I

remember is there was one officer and four men, three men or
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

something.

2
3

This is two officers with one man.
MR. STRAUSS:

I believe those are the facts of Belton,

Justice Marshall.

4

QUESTION:

I mean, I think that two officers ought to

5

be able to take care of one man.

6

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, that is precisely the sort of thing,

7

Justice Marshall, as the Court in Belton refused to inquire into

8

and I think that is exactly the sort of thing, that it is very

9

dangerous for a court to try to assess after the fact, to go

10

back and to say, well —

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. STRAUSS:

Just leave it up to the officers.
Well, when the officers were acting

13

with a reasonable apprehension of danger, as no one seems to

14

deny that they had here, and take the step precisely analogous

15

to what the Court said they could take in Belton in a situation

16

that is, as I said, even more dangerous than the Belton

17

situation because the suspect is not arrested, he is not in

18

handcuffs, he is not held at gun point or locked into the back

19

of the car.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. STRAUSS:

But he was told, whoa, and he stopped.
He was told to stop and his hands were

placed on the roof of the car.

officers had reason to believe something that wasn't present

QUESTION:

Mr. Strauss, if the Court were to adopt

3

this wingspan approach to a Terry search, does the expanded

4

search of the interior of the car of necessity involve a more

5

extensive search than would be the case for a pat down of an

6

individual where we have said you just pat them down and see if

7

there are weapons?

8

talking about a more detailed sort of a search, going in the

9

glove compartment and actually looking around, lifting up the

10

bar in the middle between the seats and that kind of thing?

11
12

To search the interior of the car, are you

MR. STRAUSS:

It is an analogous search, Justice

0'Connor.

13

QUESTION:

Would you concede that it would of

14

necessity be more extensive than the pat down that we approved

15

in Terry?

16

MR. STRAUSS:

It would be a search for weapons and

17

it couldn't reach places where a weapon could not be concealed

18

or from which it could not be obtained.

19

couldn't do what the officers did in Carroll and rip open the

20

seats.

21

QUESTION:

Yes.

For example, they

But, I assume under a Terry pat down —

22

We have not at least said, I think, that you can pull out a

23

little marijuana baggie if that is what it feels like.

25

All you

Now, in a search for the weapons in the interior of a
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

II

ii
1

car, you are arguing that you could pull out the baggie of

2

marijuana.

3

MR. STRAUSS:

If in the course of the pat down an

4

officer were to find an unidentifiable, unidentifiable by touch,

5

hard object beneath the outer clothing of the suspect, yes, he

6

certainly could reach in and pull it out and take a look at it

7

which is all that —
QUESTION:

8
9

But, not a marijuana cigarette or a little

baggie or something of that sort, right?

10

MR. STRAUSS:

If it were something that didn't feel

11

like a weapon from the outside, that is right.

12

be the same principle that would limit on this sort of search.

13

In fact —iin sort of a limited search, a weapon search.

14

it seems fairly clear that an inspection for weapons on the

15

inside of a car whereas the Court has held the expectation of

16

privacy is less and many parts of which are visible from the

17

outside by any passerby is a good deal less intrusive than

18

having an officer actually lay his hands on the suspect's body

19

as the Court described in Terry.
QUESTION:

20

And, that would

In fact,

Well, it may be less intrusive in a personal

21

sense, but you may be able to get more objects and make a more

22

thorough search.

23

doctrine?

24
25

Would you agree if you were to extend the

MR. STRAUSS:

I think the principle, the leading

principle is exactly the same, Justice O'Connor.

You can look

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

for obtainable weapons and nothing more, but, of course, nothing

2

less if the officer's safety is to be protected.

3

I think the other difficulty with the approach of the

4

Michigan Supreme Court and of Respondent, in addition to

5

increasing the uncertainty and danger faced by law enforcement

6

officers, is that it would have the effect of imposing much

7

greater burdens on suspects and of impairing values related to

8

the 4th Amendment.

9

about his safety is unsure of his authority to conduct this

10

sort of car frisk, a limited search for weapons, he will be

11

forced to take other highly intrusive actions such as handcuffing

12

a suspect or locking him in the police car through the duration

13

of the stop or possibly even holding him at gunpoint during

14

the stop.

15

That is because if an officer concerned

And, surely, most suspects will consider these to be

16

far more humiliating and unsettling actions than a limited

17

weapons inspection of a car.

18

But, if Respondent prevails, a prudent officer

19

concerned about both his own safety and the dictates of the

20

4th Amendment, will have no alternative to taking these actions.

21

Similarly, and Justice O'Connor alluded to this point

22

earlier, an officer with probable cause to arrest the suspect

23

often will merely stop him and ask him questions to see if

24

there is some exculpatory explanation, but if the consequence —

25

And that way he can avoid an unnecessary arrest, but if the
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

I
i

1

consequence of stopping a suspect instead of arresting him, is

2

that there is some question about the officer's ability to

3

protect his own safety, then, of course, the officer simply

4

will not hesitate to make an arrest and conduct a complete

5

search, an undoubtedly more intrusive search, incident to arrest

6

that Belton gives him the right to conduct.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think that Belton applies where the

8

search is not a custodial arrest or where the arrest is not a

9

custodial arrest?

10

MR. STRAUSS:

11

QUESTION:

I am not sure there is —

If the search incident in Robinson and

12

Gustoferson applies only to custodial arrests, do you think

13

Belton nonetheless applies across the board?

14
15
16

MR. STRAUSS:

I am not sure I understand the difference

between custodial arrests and other sorts of arrests.
QUESTION:

Well, I think a custodial arrest is where

17

the police plan to take the person arrested into custody as

18

opposed to simply giving him a ticket.

19

MR. STRAUSS:

If they don't plan to take him and remove

20

him from the scene subsequent to the arrest, I think there is

21

some question from the face of the Belton opinion whether Belton

22

applies to such.

23

and where the suspect and the officers are in continuous contact

24

on the scene and the officers' exposure to danger and exposure

25

to hidden weapons is to that extent.

Here, of course, we have a stop on the scene

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION:

There is the crucial question whether they

2

do, in fact, intend to take him into custody or whether they are

3

lawfully authorized to do it, whether they do or do not take him

4

into custody.

5

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, for purposes of what happened in

6

this case, even if there were certainly no probable cause and

7

no grounds to take him into custody and only reasonable suspicion

8

to stop him, they would be authorized in taking these limited

measures necessary to protect their safety.

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It is

current Michigan law and the Michigan Supreme Court plainly

and unmistakably said that the Michigan Constitution, Article 1,

by the State Constitution.

protection to citizens under the State Constitution than under

MR. GEARY:

I believe that it does.

And, I have

3

mentioned in my brief a few of the many instances where Michigan

4

does take a broader view of citizens' rights under the State

5

Constitution than exist under the Federal Constitution.

6

Getting to the question of whether or not the so-called

7

protective search of the car violated the Federal Constitution,

8

I think that the Michigan Supreme Court has recently shown that

9

it recognizes the difference between the cases that are cited

10

in the dissent in the Michigan Supreme Court and this sort of a

11

case where there was no articulable facts to which the officers

12

could point to demonstrate danger.

13

Chief Justice Coleman, in her dissent, listed a great

14

many decisions from other jurisdictions and where searches of

15

automobiles were upheld.

16

those cases were distinguishable on the facts.

I have suggested in our brief that

17

Two days before Christmas the Michigan Supreme Court

18

decided People v. Esters and upheld a warrantless search of an

19

automobile and facts very similar to many of the cases cited by

20

Justice Coleman in her dissent.

21

In People v. Esters, a dry-cleaning establishment was

22

held up and a young boy who saw the crime take place wrote down

23

the license number of the car that was involved and gave a

24

description of the car and a description of the robber.

25

minutes the police had located the car, found it in a driveway,

were wet footprints from the car into the house.

given by the witness, went out into the driveway and searched

the car and found a pistol that matched the description of the

pistol that was used in the robbery.

10

There were

They went into

And, of the six Justices of the Michigan Supreme Court
who decided that case, five wrote on the question of whether or
not the search was lawful and five said that it was.

11

And, I think that People v. Esters is like Minnesota

12

v. Gilchrist and Uptegraft v. Alaska and U.S. v. Powless and

13

all the other cases cited by Justice Coleman in her dissent,

14

cases where the police officers had some specific reason to

15

believe that the defendant was dangerous as in Uptegraft v.

16

Alaska.

17

It was almost identical on its facts to People v. Esters
In Powless, the police had received radio information

18

describing a van that was alleged to have been occupied by armed

19

men and one of them had an outstanding arrest warrant on him.

20

He was headed toward an Indian Reservation where there had been

21

some shootings within a few days.

22

Some of the other cases I have mentioned in the brief

23

are quite similar, Massachusetts v. Almeida.

standards and subjective factors.

not have the subjective believe that he should be in fear for

MR. GEARY:

Terry discusses the officer's well-founded

belief of fear for his own safety and that is why I say I think
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

it is a difficult mix.

2

I think as a minumum — I think if the officer held an

3

unreasonable belief that his own safety was in danger the search

4

wouldn't be justifiable.

5

QUESTION:

Yes, I think that is probably it.

But, I

6

am not sure that the cases support you in requiring both an

objective and subjective belief.

There is a Michigan case where I have cited in my

21

brief where a traffic detainee returned to his car and used

22

the car to assault the officer.

23

And, literally, if there is a traffic stop and the

24

justification for the so-called search, protective frisk of the

25

car is that the detainee might return to the car and use
35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

something in it or the car itself to injure the officer, then

2

as a practical matter you are saying that any detainee, traffic

3

detainee that is stopped is going to have his car searched.
QUESTION:

4
5

Well, is that all bad when you are talking

about a search for weapons?
MR. GEARY:

6

I personally don't believe this was a

7

search for weapons as evidenced by the fact the officers never

8

treated the Defendant as a dangerous person and ignored very

9

obvious tools that could have been used to hurt themselves and

10

instead concentrated on a billfold.
QUESTION:

11

But that isn't the ground that the Supreme

12

Court of Michigan went on, that it really wasn't a search for

13

weapons?
MR. GEARY:

14
15

No, they did not say that.

They assumed

that it was a protective search.
And, the answer to your question is, yes, I think it

16
17

would be bad.

I think that the framers of the Constitution had

18

in mind the dangers of police work when they drafted the 4th

19

Amendment.

20

efforts of British revenue officers to enforce tax laws with

21

writs of assistance, and they knew that people sometimes violently

22

resisted the efforts of police to enforce the law and they still

23

passed the 4th Amendment.

They had long experience with smugglers, with the

24

I think that the —

25

QUESTION:

Well, the question is whether the 4th
36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

I

1

Amendment prohibits this.

2

MR. GEARY:

Exactly so.

3

I think that this case is much more like Sibron v.

4

New York than it is like Terry v. Ohio. In Sibron, you will recall

5

the Court said, that a police officer couldn't just start searching

6

for evidence.

7

that he was actually searching for weapons.

8
9

They had to have some indication that at least —

As I just mentioned in this case, the officers gave
every indication that they weren't searching for weapons.

They

10

ignored the most obvious things in the car that were in plain

11

view that could have been used as weapons, the screwdriver

12

and the hammer, and instead, concentrated on a small leather

13

object that was small enough to be placed in the deputy's back

14

pocket which is where he put it after he picked it up.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GEARY:

What did they do with the knife?
I wish I knew.

We can't find the knife.

17

As far as I am concerned, it still belongs to Mr. Long.

18

deputy — The one deputy who went to the car first picked it up

19

and actually held it in his hand while the other deputy frisked

20

Mr. Long and then I believe one of the deputies put the knife in

21

his pocket.

It was not returned to Mr. Long and it was not put

22

in the car.

It was used in evidence at the trial, but I don't

23

know where the knife is now.

24
25

The

I would like to point out that Mr. Long was cooperative
at all times.

He did everything the officers asked.
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

They

1

described him as cooperative.

2

QUESTION:

3

6

Well, does the record show where he was

going when he turned around and walked away?

4
5

MR. GEARY:

Not very clearly.

QUESTION:

But they had asked him for his registration

statement which he didn't have.

8

headed back to get it?

10

11

He was still not at the

doorway.

7

9

He was not belligerent.

MR. GEARY:

It is clear enough that he was

He didn't say anything.

He started towards

the doorway.
QUESTION:

Do the officers say that they anticipated

12

that he was going to go back into the car to hunt for the

13

registration statement to see if he had one?

14

MR. GEARY:

My recollection of their testimony is that

15

they made no assumption as to what he was doing, just described

16

his acts rather than — They didn't say what they

17

was about to do.

18

QUESTION:

thought he

I understood from your colleague that the

19

testimony of the officer was that they thought he was going back

20

to the car to find the registration statement.

21

MR. GEARY:

Well, I can't complain — They had just

22

asked him for the registration statement and that is the only

23

logical explanation, but I can't recall anything in the record

24

where the deputies specifically testified that they thought that

25

was what Mr. Long was doing.
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

On the other hand —

2

QUESTION:

3

Sometimes people keep them in the glove

compartment.

4

MR. GEARY:

As a matter of fact, they never did get

5

the registration papers for this particular car.

6

paper that showed the car was titled in someone else's name,

7

two different documents.

8

paper.

9

They found the

They never did get the registration

I might point out that under Michigan law, even if

10

he refused — If he said, no, I won't produce the registration

11

paper, they wouldn't have been entitled to make a custodial

12

arrest, People v. Marshall, People v. 7th District Judge.

13

are required to carry it, but they can't — They can give him

14

an appearance ticket for not having his registration, they can't

15

take him into custody.

16

You

And, contrary to what Mr. Caruso said, even at the

17

time of this traffic offense, they could not have made a custodia]

18

arrest for speeding under the Michigan Motor Vehicle Act.

19

citation is in the brief.

20

They are required to give an appearance ticket unless there are

21

some facts that weren't present here.

22

QUESTION:

The

It is MCLA 257. — I think it is 727.

What do they call it in Michigan when you

23

stop a fellow for speeding and insist that he stay there until

24

he gets a ticket?

25

That is just a detention.

MR. GEARY:

A traffic stop.
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

QUESTION:

It is a traffic stop, a detention for the

purpose of giving a ticket.

3

MR. GEARY:

I think it would be pretty clear that he is

4

not arrested as Michigan courts use that word.

5

arrested him, he would have to^ comply with the Michigan Interim

6

Bail Act which would have given him an opportunity to post bond

7

before they could have given him the intensive sort of search

8

that they would have done before the admitted him to the jail.

9

I think there are lots of state law reasons why they could not

10

If they had

have taken Mr. Long into custody.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GEARY:

Or his car.
Or his car.

I think there was even less

13

justification for taking his car and impounding it.

14

have to impound his car.

15

I think —

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GEARY:

18

They didn't

They wanted to impound his car and

Even after they found marijuana in the car?
I think that is correct.

They could have

taken the marijuana and left the car.

19

Under — It is important to remember that they never

20

tried to justify the search of the trunk as either a search

21

incident to arrest or as a probable cause search.

22

tried —

23
24
25

QUESTION:

If they

I know they didn't, but let's assume we

disagree with you.
MR. GEARY:

They would have lost as a matter of state
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

law had they made that —

2

QUESTION:

Well, let's assume that we disagree with

3

you and that the — looking under the armrest was defensible and

4

was not unreasonable and that finding the initial bag of

5

marijuana was defensible and suppose he had been arrested right

6

then, could they have searched the car?

7

MR. GEARY:

8

New York v. Belton.

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. GEARY:

We would lose under U.S. v. Ross and

And you would lose under federal law.
And I think we would win under People v.

11

Hilber which is Michigan law which was exactly that case.

12

found marijuana in the passenger compartment, wanted to search

13

the trunk and the Michigan Supreme Court said you could not do

14

that.

That case is also in our brief.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GEARY:

17

Without a warrant.
Without a warrant.

Yes, they could have

gone out and got a warrant.

QUESTION:

Does Michigan follow Carroll at all if you

have probable cause to search a car?

20

MR. GEARY:

There are some Michigan Court of Appeals

21

cases, including some recent ones, that say that they follow

22

Carroll.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. GEARY:

25

What does the Supreme Court of Michican say?
I can't recall the People v. Hilber case

well enough to know if they even discussed it at all.
41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me if you make that

2

arrest we have just described and then say that you can't search

3

the trunk of the car you must not follow Carroll.

4

MR. GEARY:

I don't believe that Michigan does.

5

just can't recall the opinion in Hilber well enough to say

6

whether it does or does not.

7

I

The last point that I would like to mention briefly

8

is the so-called inventory search.

9

of an issue it is before this Court, but my understanding is

I am not so sure how much

10

there are two requirements for an inventory search.

11

has to be a search; and, secondly, there has to be an inventory.

12

If you don't have both ingredients, you don't have an inventory

13

search.

This search produced no inventory.

14

When the deputies testified —

15

QUESTION:

16
17

I am not sure I know what you mean when

they produced on inventory.
MR. GEARY:

There was no list of the things that was

18

found in the car.

19

couldn't describe accurately what was in the car.

20

recollection of it.

21

One, there

When the deputy testified at the trial, he
He had a dim

If the excuse was that they wanted to protect themselves;

22

against crimes of theft or intrusion by vandals or that sort of

23

stuff, it was —

24
25

QUESTION:

You mean they didn't write out a description

of items when you say they had no inventory?
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. GEARY:

Yes.

They didn't write out a description.

2

The search stopped when they found the marijuana in the trunk.

3

The deputy testified that he had an investigatory motive and

4

most importantly he testified that the Barry County Sheriff's

5

Department did not do an inventory search when he testified at

6

the preliminary examination.

7

in their department for inventory searches.

8
9

There was no standard procedure

It was plainly a ruse and the Michigan Supreme Court
didn't reach that question because they didn't feel they had to.

10

QUESTION:

May I ask you — You may be repeating, but

11

you said that as a matter of Michigan law the search of the trunk

12

would have been improper under the Hilber case.

13

MR. GEARY:

14

QUESTION:

I believe that it would have, yes.
Is that because the presence of marijuana

15

in the car does not establish probable cause to believe there is

16

marijuana in the trunk or assuming there is probable cause you

17

still can't open the trunk?

18

MR. GEARY:

I think that — My recollection of Hilber

19

is the former, proving there is marijuana in the passenger

20

compartment is not probably cause to believe that there is

21

marijuana in the trunk.

22
23

QUESTION:

Is that a Michigan case based on

Michigan law or on federal law, do you know?

24
25

I see.

MR. GEARY:
today.

I wish I had read it just before I came

I just really can't recall.
