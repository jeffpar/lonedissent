ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER G. NASH, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
HR. NASHs

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

tha Court, this case arises here on a petition for

10

certiorari of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

It

11

involves two arbitration issues in the tension between

12

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the

13

seniority layoff provisions of a collective bargaining

14

agreement.

15

In 1973, tha EEOC investigated the company's

16

plant in Mississippi and found that there was probable

17

cause to balieve that the company had discriminated in

18

its hiring practices on the basis of sex.

19

company and the union which whom it had a collective

20

bargaining agreement, bargained a new collective

21

bargaining agreement.

22

the company knew of the EEOC's findings, knew that the

23

EEOC was seeking a conciliation agreement which might

24

disrupt the seniority layoff provisions of the

25

collective bargaining agreement, but nonetheless entered

In 1974,

the

At the time, both the union and

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

into a new collective bargaining agreement, retaining -QUESTION:

2

Mr. Nash, you said the union had

3

notice.

4

union was bound by what the company agreed to with the

5

EEOC?

6

Does that suggest or do you think that the

MR. NASH;

Not necessarily so, Your Honor, but

7

that becomes relevant later on when we get to the

8

argument about the court order that enjoined the company

9

and the union, and whether or not that's a valid defense

10
11
12

to a breach of contract action.
On December 11, 1974, the company and the EEOC
entered into a conciliation agreement which changed or

3

would change the layoff provisions of the collective

4

bargaining agreement by providing that if there is a

5

layoff in the plant, females must be retained in the

6

workforce in the same percentage at the end of the

7

layoff as they were at the beginning of the layoff.

8

reason for that being to protect those recently hired

9

female employees from layoff.

20

The

On December 19, 1974, the company had a layoff

21

of some employees.

A few more were laid off in the

22

early part of 1975.

23

contending that those layoffs violated the collective

24

bargaining agreement because some more senior men were

25

laid off whereas junior seniority women were retained.

The union filed grievances

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The company amended and then complained in the

2

then present law suit seeking to enjoin the union from

3

processing those grievances to arbitration, added the

4

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as a defendant

5

and sought a declaratory judgment from the court as to

6

which should apply, the provisions of the EEOC

7

conciliation agreement or the provisions of the

8

collective bargaining agreement.
QUESTION;

9
10

Was the intimation of the company’s

position that both of them could not apply?

11

NR. NASH:

That is correct.

12

QUESTION;

Why did the company take that

14

NR. NASH;

Because --

15

QUESTION;

The company can bind itself with

13

position?

16

the EEOC, and I should think still continue to be bound

17

with the union.
NR. NASH;

18

Possibly, sir, but there was a

19

tension, and I think an admitted tension between the

20

conciliation agreement and the collective bargaining

21

agreement.

22

QUESTION;

I don’t see where you get the

23

concept of tension.

24

Employer A can make an agreement to

1,000 bottles from a contractor, and then he can go

2

shipments of bottles, but he is bound to both of the

3

people that he has contracted with.

4

He may not be able to use both

MR. NASH:

That is correct, but I think we

5

have different facts in this case, Your Honor.

6

all, we are dealing with a collective bargaining

7

agreement and an EEOC conciliation agreement, neither of

8

which have historically by this Court been treated as

9

standard commercial contracts.

10

First of

Secondly, we have in this case an EEOC

11

conciliation agreement which was sought by the Equal

12

Employment Opportunity in order for the employer to come

13

into compliance with the law.

14

QUESTION;

15
16
17
18

Are you saying that the EEOC

agreement under these circumstances binds the union?
MR. NASH;

If the union had notice, as it did,

of the EEOC conciliation process, and if the union -QUESTION:

You said a moment ago in answer to

19

my question that the mere fact that the union had notice

20

didn't result in binding the union.

21

MR. NASH:

If the union had notice of the

22

process, of the EEOC conciliation process, and was

23

afforded an opportunity to participate in that process,

24

then, yes, I am saying that the conciliation agreement

25

between the company and the Equal Employment Opportunity

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Commission may amend or change the collective bargaining

2

agreement, but I am not saying that the union was

3

without remedy in that case.
QUESTION;

4
5

What is your authority for the

position you have just stated?
MR. NASH;

6

The authority for that position is,

7

I think, multiple but primarily PEPSICO, Inc., versus

8

FTC, 472 F2d —

9

QUESTION;

I mean a case from this Court.

10

HR. NASH;

-- 179.

11

QUESTION;

Another case from this Court.

12

HR. NASH;

Furthermore, I think that is

13

consistent with what this Court held in Zipes versus

14

TWA.

15
16
17

QUESTION;

So Zipes is your authority from

this Court?
HR. NASH;

Yes.

I think the one I am arguing

18

is consistent with that.

19

and that is the overriding premise underlying Title VII

20

of the Civil Rights Act, that being that the preferred

21

means of resolving Title VII liability is through the

22

conciliation process with EEOC.

23

QUESTION;

There is additional authority

If the employer conciliates with

24

the EEOC, he can repudiate any inconsistent agreements

25

he has made?

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. NASH:

Not to the extent that it

2

forecloses the union from having a remedy, Your Honor.

3

Indeed, the union does have a remedy in that case.

4

remedy either is to participate in the conciliation

5

process and agree or, failing that, to bring an action

6

against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and

7

the employer seeking to stay any conciliation agreement

8

it believes is not necessary and not appropriate to

9

remedy Title VII violations.

The

That remedy, I think, is available to the

10
11

union and we are not contending that in such a law suit

12

that either the employer or the EEOC can say, no, no,

13

our agreement covers this and you, union, have no cause

14

of action.

15

action.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

Indeed, they would have that cause of

decided?

How would that cause of action be

What standard of law would govern it?
MR. NASH:

It would be similar to a proceeding

19

in a Title VII now where there is a consent decree, a

20

reasonableness proceeding or a fairness proceeding in

21

which it is determined whether or not the conciliation

22

agreement entered into is in fact reasonable and fair,

23

whether it meets the requirements of Title VII without

24

unduly impinging upon the rights of the majority

25

employees presently in the workforce.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

As I say, the employer and the EEOC entered

2

into this conciliation agreement.

3

brought grievances.

4

sought a declaratory judgment from the court as to which

5

should apply, the conciliation agreement or the

6

collective bargaining agreement.

The union, in fact,

The employer went into court and

The court, in November 1976 -- 1975, came down

7
8

with a decision holding that the conciliation agreement

9

applies and ordering both the company and the union to

10

abide by the terms of the conciliation agreement and not

11

to abide by the terms of the collective bargaining

12

agreement.

13

Subsequently, in

1976 --

14

QUESTION!

Was that an injunction?

15

MR. NASH;

The court, I believe, interpreted

16

it as an injunction. Your Honor.

17

this case, which is now before this Court, and stated in

18

his opinion there that had the parties not complied with

19

that order, he would have found them in contempt, and

20

that certainly is the way in which at least the company

21

construed that order.

22

The same judge heard

In 1976, as I say, there was a layoff and

23

there were more grievances filed.

In January 1978, the

24

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the injunction

25

order that had been issued -- or the order that had been

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

issued by the District Court back in 1975.

2

Circuit did on the grounds, basically, of this Court's

3

Teamster decision holding that you can't disrupt

4

otherwise valid seniority provisions in the collective

5

bargaining agreement in order to remedy Title VII

6

violations.

7

The Fifth

Immediately after the Fifth Circuit's

8

decision, the company reinstated all of the senior men

9

who were laid off to junior women, and the cases then

10

went to arbitration pursuant to the statement of the

11

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordering the parties to

12

arbitrate the company's breach of the seniority

13

provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.

14

The first arbitration involved a layoff which

15

had occurred in 1976, after the District Court's order.

16

Arbitrator Sabella in that case said that the company

17

didn't violate the collective bargaining agreement, it

18

had done exactly what the court had ordered it to do,

19

and as a consequence the company should not be liable

20

for back-pay for the employee involved in that case.

21

A second case was brought before Abitrator

22
23
24
25

Barrett involving three -QUESTIONS

Has any remedy been worked out for

Mr. Jowers at all?
MR.

NASH*.

I don *t know whether he is or not.

anymore?

4

All of these employees were returned to work immediately

5

upon the Fifth Circuit's decision reversing the District

6

Court's case.

7

assuming that if he is not working for Grace, it is for

8

some reason other than this case.

9

There is nothing in the record.

I am

All of the senior males were immediately

10

returned to work, and there is no contention here that

11

the company continued to "violate the collective

12

bargaining agreement" after the District Court’s order

13

was reversed.

14

But there has been no award of back-pay for Mr. lowers.

15

All the men were in fact brought back.

The second arbitrator, Mr. Barrett, was

16

confronted by the union's contention in that arbitration

17

that he did not have to follow the Sabella award because

18

the Sabella award was considering or considered

19

different factual circumstances.

20

The union contended in that arbitration that

21

Sabella hai dealt with a bumping.

Indeed, Mr. lowers,

22

rather than having been laid out of the workforce, had

23

merely been bumped from his job down to a lower job, and

24

then ultimately laid off.

25

cases that were now being argued before Mr. Barrett

Whereas the three subsequent

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

involved actual layoffs of senior males from the

2

workforce.

3

The union contended that these involved

4

different situations, different fact situations, and

5

therefore arbitrator Barrett was not bound by the

6

earlier award of Mr. Sabella.

7

The arbitrator in that case, arbitrator

8

Barrett, found that in fact the cases involved exactly

9

the same issues.

He found, however, that Mr. Sabella

10

had exceeded his jurisdiction and authority by not

11

referring to the collective bargaining agreement, but by

12

merely finding

13

liable because it did what a court said it ought to do.

14

Mr. Barrett ordered back-pay for all of the employees

15

affected by that layoff during the pendency of the court

16

order.

that it wasn't fair to holdthe company

I think it is important to note at this point

17
18

that the case was tried before arbitrator Barrett and

19

has been tried

all the way throughthe courts as

20

of the layoffs

here were involved with the court order

21

-- followed the court order rather than before the court

22

order.

23

if all

Indeed, the company raised the distinction

24

between layoffs under the conciliation agreement

25

pre-court order and layoffs that occurred after the

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

court order in the District Court on the initial motions

2

for summary judgment, but noted at that time that the

3

parties had not arbitrated the case based on those

4

distinctions.
The union never picked up on the distinction,

5
6

nor did the District Court, nor did the Fifth Circuit.

7

As a consequence, the case we submit comes before you as

8

if all of these layoffs occurred following the court

9

order.
QUESTION:

10

Can't you strip it down even

QUESTION:

But that concession is really

Certainly, if there is a concession as a fact, the

25

parties are bound by it.

Secondly, even if it is a
I believe that it is too late to

Indeed, what we have here is the union — The

12
13

union filed the first motion for summary judgment in

14

this case in the District Court.

15

that the Barrett award cannot stand because the Sabella

16

arbitration award has to fall.

17

one -- Barrett is not required to follow Sabella for two

18

reasons.

19

It contended in there

It has to fall, number

Number one, Sabella decided a different issue,

20

therefore, Barrett doesn’t have to decide that issue.

21

Secondly, Sabella went beyond his jurisdiction and

22

authority, therefore, his award is void.

23

asked the District Court to determine whether or not, as

24

a matter of law under legal precedent, that award would

25

have been "enforceable," and contended that it was not.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

talking about the same, is that the company had argued

2

in the District Court and again in the Fifth Circuit

3

that even Barrett couldn’t determine as a procedural

4

matter whether or not the Sabella award was valid

5

initially because the union had never brought a law suit

6

to set a side the Sabella award in a timely manner.

7

Accordingly, everybody was foreclosed from contesting

8

whether or not the Sabella award was valid.

Yes, I think the language might be susceptible

20

to the question you pose, except for the fact that that

was clearly in response to a totally different argument

not present in this Court.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF AMICUS CURIAE
MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court.

Initially, I note that the government

12

will only address the third issue presented in the

13

petition for writ of certiorari because that is the only

14

issue in which the government has a particular

15

interest.
ile do note that the resolution of the third

16
17

issue is itself contingent on the proper disposition of

18

the first two questions.

19

the first two issues in favor of the petitioner, then

20

there will be no reason to address the issue of special

21

concern to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in

22

this case.

23

If the Court decides either of

The Commission is the Federal agency vested

24

with the primary duty under Title VII to eliminate

25

discrimination in the workplace.

In performing this

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

mission/ Congress expressly obliged the Commission to

2

attempt in the first instance to conciliate employment

3

discrimination disputes in order to resolve them, if at

4

all possible, without having to resort to judicial

5

proceedings.

6

process, the Commission every year resolves literally

7

hundreds of cases, in some years even thousands of

8

cases, without having to consume a single second of

9

judicial time.

Through this informal conciliation

Conciliation is thus properly regarded both by

10
11

Congress and the Commission as the most appropriate

12

means of resolving employment discrimination disputes.

Indeed, it is central to the Commission's ability to

14

perform its mission, given the large number of Title VII

15

cases that come before the Commission and the relatively

16

limited resources the Commission has to dispose of those

17

cases.

18

The Commission submits that it is central to

19

its ability to conciliate disputes that collective

20

bargaining agreements that conflict with arguable

21

requirements of Title VII must be set aside, and that

In taking this position, the Commission

appreciates the importance to the national labor policy

of arbitrations.

3

settled by this Court.

4

In our view, in following reasonable

conciliation agreements in disregard of the collective

bargaining agreements, the best balance is the relevant

interest at stake in these kinds of cases.

8

is proper primarily because it encourages settlements

with employers that otherwise might be deterred.

right there.

You talk about the interest in getting the

17

union involved in the conciliation process.

18

they called up the union and said, "We’d like you to

19

attend the final meeting on the conciliation

agreement."

21

and the union representative came over and said, "Well,

22

that's fine, except I think our contract is lawful and

23

we want to defend it in the Court of Appeals.

24

refuse to agree to any change in it."

Do you think you would have as strong a

HR. PHILLIPS:

Maybe not as strong a case,

4

although I don’t think those facts differ -- I mean, I

don't think that we would set aside the conciliation

agreement simply because the union declines to

7

participate in the process.
QUESTIONS

10

Even though, as I understand it,

the conciliation agreement is founded on a mistake of
law .

11

HR. PHILLIPS.-

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

It is founded on the assumption

13

that the seniority provisions were unlawful, which of

14

course turned out to be incorrect.

15

HR. PHILLIPS:

It is true that this Court’s

16

decision in Teamsters cast some doubt on the

17

conciliation agreement, although it is still an open

18

question whether the kind of relief granted in the

19

conciliation agreement might otherwise have been

20

permissible as a remedy for any kind of hiring

21

discrimination.

22

QUESTION:

But the violation, as I understand

23

it, insofar as the sex discrimination charge is

24

concerned, strictly was on the basis that the seniority

25

provisions were unlawful, isn’t that right?

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. PHILLIPS!

Yes, that is true, that is

2

true, although again there was a finding of reasonable

3

cause to believe there had been hiring discrimination,

4

and then whether or not in the circumstances of this

5

particular case, where you have immediate layoffs, it

6

might well have been regarded at that time as a basis

7

for modifying the layoff procedures, that is all.
QUESTION:

8
9

Is it the EEOC policy in a

three-cornered situation like this just to ignore the

10

third party, the union, or to get them involved in the

11

situation?

12

MR. PHILLIPS;

No, Your Honor, the EEOC’s

13

compliance manual expressly provides that notice should

14

be given to the union at any time it appears that

15

provisions in the collective bargaining agreement may

16

conflict with proposed conciliation efforts.

is invited routinely to come in and participate.

18

QUESTION;

The union

But if there was a violation here,

19

the union would have been cruilty of a violation as well

20

as the employer?

21

MR. PHILLIPS;

22

QUESTION;

I am sorry.

If the premise for the agreement,

23

namely, illegality, if that was correct, the union would

24

also have been guilty of a violation, would it not?

Yes.
Presumably, although there was

no charge against the union, so it would have been

difficult --

violating Title VII, although it does seem that there is

We have already discussed the union's

I think it is also important to realize that

17

the incumbent employees' interests in this case are not

18

violated by virtue of following the conciliation

19

agreement in most instances because, as in this case,

20

the original award in this case followed at that point

21

the judicial decree, but presumably might very well have

22

followed the conciliation agreement itself as a

23

reasonable statement of what the law required.

25

This collective bargaining agreement contains
an illegality clause in it, and thus the reasonable

Accordingly, by following the

opportunity for some sort of a safe harbor that has been

called into question by the EEOC's action in asking them

to agree to a particular agreement and, in turn, it will

cases for any employer to agree to any form of

That result, we

question in that order.
*?ith regard to the substance of the question

12

concerning the arbitration award, this is a case by the

13

company to overturn a particular arbitration award, the

14

award rendered by arbitrator Barrett and called the

15

Barrett award.

16

Arbitrator Barrett was faced with a threshold

17

issue in considering the grievances filed with him,

18

which is quite common, namely, what deference if any is

19

to be accorded to a prior arbitrator's award in dealing

20

with the same aspects of the contract.
\

21

Arbitrator Barrett determined not to follow

22

the prior award, the so-called Sabella award, which had

23

never been taken to court and was a preexisting

24

determination concerning the meaning of the contract.

25

He did so after quite a painstaking and thorough

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

evaluation of the prior award.

2

that is a far higher standard than arbitrators normally

3

follow in determining whether or not to follow a prior

4

awa rd.

5

He did so by erecting

He determined not to follow the prior award.

6

He came to the conclusion that his obligation in

7

deciding what the express terms of the agreement meant

8

compelled him to look at the agreement to look at the

9

agreement itself and not to handle the matter as

10

arbitraror Sabella had done.

11

were in accord with the normal way arbitrators handle

12

this matter and, if anything, more favorable, far more

13

favorable to the company than is the norm.

14

His actions, as I say,

In addition, the lower court law is uniform

15

that there is no requirement of law, no Section 301

16

requirement of arbitral stare decisis.

17

bargain about that as they bargain about other matters.

18

The parties can

After arbitrator Barrett issued his award, the

19

company was dissatisfied with it, and as is its right,

20

went to court to overturn that award.

21

We believe that the proper question here,

the

22

analytic question that ought to be faced is what

23

standard is the Barrett award insofar as Barrett refused

24

to follow the earlier Sabella award to be judged by.

25

is our submission that the standard is the one stated in

16

may be on an arbitrator's award?

If the courts, either in this proceeding or

interpreting the contract is for the arbitrator, but it

than any othec.

award is inconsistent with the prior award, or that the

arbitrator misinterpreted his obligations under the

have conceded anything.

cases, and most particularly the Carbon Fuel case in 444

15

U.S., the Court has made it plain that Congress’s point

16

in enacting Section 301, and indeed the point overall of

17

the national labor policy, is to provide for stability

through free collective bargaining and to provide that

QUESTION;

How do you respond to the S.G.'s

3

position that, surely, you should not be freed from

4

having the requirements of Title VII imposed?

5

SB. GOLD;

That, Justice O'Connor, turns me to

6

the last of what I have labeled the four questions which

7

concerns the effect of the conciliation agreement.

8

9

First of all, as I attempted to state at an
earlier point in answering Justice Rehnquist's question,

10

we have no doubt that any collective agreement that is

11

contrary to Title VII simply cannot be enforced.

12

company, having taken the gamble it did against the

13

background of the law, had been proved right, this

14

agreement would not have been -- the collective

15

agreement would not have been subject to enforcement.

16

Arbitrator Barrett's award would have been subject to

17

having been overturned as contrary to Title VII.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

If the

That would be true even if there

had been no conciliation agreement.
MR. GOLD:

Absolutely.

But we believe that it

21

strains Title VII far past the breaking point to say

22

that the EEOC, which Congress did not give the power to

23

adjudicate claims or to enter orders — I just was

24

looking for words of Alexander versus Gardner Denver —

25

the Commission cannot adjudicate claims or impose

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

administrative sanctions.

2

It would be extraordinarily surpr ising and

3

wholly irrational to conclude that the EECC can

4

nonetheless enter into a conciliation agree ment with A

5

by which B's rights — contract rights are destroyed,

6

and to say that that conciliation agreement , even though

7

it can *t stand the test of being placed aga inst the law

8

in a court, is superior to the collective b argainin g

9

agreement.
Me think, that not only did Congre ss not grant

10
11

any such broad powers to the Commission, bu t as this

12

Court has noted and most recently in the Ca lifornia

13

Brewers case, again in 444 U.S., Title VII was drafted

14

against the background of the national labo r policy.

15

the Court said there, "It does not behoove the courts to

16

second guess the processes of collective ba rgaining.”

17

Certainly this agency was not given the pow er to second

18

guess those processes.

2

In concluding, I would like to address the

3

point that somehow that view will end the conciliation

4

system with regard to situations involving collective

5

bargaining agreements.

6

because this is not a zero-sum game where only the

7

employer is at jeopardy.
If the union was presented with the

conciliation here, and it took the view that the

10

agreement, the collective bargaining agreement was

11

lawful and it wanted to stick with it -QUESTIGK:

Suppose, Mr. Gold, that instead of

13

joining in that conciliation agreement, the employer had

said, "I want to protect my flanks," and takes it to

hypothesis.

17

and then the decree was entered.

18

Then they went into court.

Let's take one

First, the employer put in their defense,

MR. GOLD:

What about that?

Well, in the situations of that

19

kind, Your Honor, what I understand the law to be is

20

that the courts have ample power in determining who has

22

collective agreement, to impose those liabilities on

whoever is at fault.

2

So the imperatives for the union to enter into

3

the conciliation process in many cases are precisely the

4

same as the imperatives that drive anyone into

5

conciliation, a desire to bring one's situation into

6

conformity with law, a desire to avoid the cost of

7

litigation, costs which most unions are not in as good a

8

position as most companies to deal with, and a desire to

9

safeguard against potential liabilities.
QUESTIORi

10

Let me change that hypothetical

11

just a little.

Instead of simply putting in no

12

evidence, the employer had stipulated that the

13

conciliation agreement could be the basis for a judgment

14

of the court, in other words, a stipulated judgment.

15

that the only difference from this situation that we

16

have is that the conciliation agreement would have been

17

ratified.
MR. GOLD*

18

I see, Your Honor.

I apologize.

19

missed the point of your first hypothetical and I

20

apologize.

21

fts I understand the procedural situation in

22

cases of that kind, in any such case the union at the

23

least would be a Rule 19 Defendant and be entitled to

24

argue for and to defend the legality of the contract.

25

was envisioning a situation in which both parties

recognize! that they had an unlawful contract.
Clearly, what is the essence of our concern

3

about the last of the arguments the company makes is

4

that it is designed to either force the union to attack

5

a conciliation agreement to get into court, or to deny a

6

union, which believes that its collective bargaining

7

agreement is lawful which has the contract rights of

8

those who are covered by the agreement to defend, any

9

opportunity to defend them.

10

He don't believe that Title VII denies unions

11

that opportunity or takes away contract rights in that

12

way, and we would have the gravest due process doubts of

13

the validity of any statute which had the effect of

14

taking these contract rights away through an agreement

15

between the government and A.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. NASH;

The hypothetical you posed at the

end is basically what happened in this case.

The

24

company indeed went into court here, but the union and

25

the EEOC joined -- filed cross-motions for summary

the collective bargaining agreement was valid under

that this court order u ltimately was reversed on appeal

25

excused from breaching the collective bargaining

QUESTION;

injunction against arbitration, and wasn't that

It was an injunction against that,

QUESTION;

That was part of the injunction?

21

MR. NASH;

That is my understanding, yes.

22

That is my recollection.
Furthermore, I believe that the union cannot

argue that it was the "company's fault" that this order

25

issued.

They state two bases for that.

There was a fully litigated case between the

EEOC and the union as to whether or not there had been a

6

violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.

7

Ultimately, the court found, yes, the District Court,

there is no valid, finely enforceable Title VII order

that, indeed, the company's prior discrimination cannot
