Mr. Bator, you may proceed whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. BATOR, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BATORt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, this case involves Three Mile Island

11

Unit 1 nuclear power reactor, TMI 1.

12

two units at Three Mile Island.

13

unit, TMI 2, that the Three Mile Island accident

14

occurred in March of 1979.

TMI 1 is one of

It was in the other

15

When that accident occurred, TMI 1 happened to

16

be shut down for routine refueling, and it has been shut

17

down ever since, and this case involves its restart.

18

The question before the Court is whether the

19

Nuclear Regulatory Commission, before it may begin —

20

before it may permit TMI 1 to restart, is required by

21

the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, is required

22

to make an inquiry in order to predict whether and to

23

what extent psychological stress will occur on restart

24

because of the fear and anxiety of neighboring residents

25

that there may be a second accident at Three Mile Island.

U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The government's central contention is that

2

NEPA does not require administrative agencies to conduct

3

an inquiry for the purpose of predicting fears that

4

their proposed actions may engender.
The central purpose of NEPA is to require the

5
6

government to take a hard look at the impact of its

7

proposed actions on the natural environment, and on the

8

direct consequence of those interventions, and we argue

9

that stress caused by fear and anxiety that government

10

action may be harmful to you is not an environmental

11

impact, and is therefore not cognizant.

12

Now, I may give a humble example to the

13

Court.

14

amounts of fluoride into the water, of course, the

15

government must make a scrupulous inquiry whether the

16

fluoridation will be harmful or helpful to health.

17

our contention is that Congress did not contemplate that

18

a separate and distinct inquiry be made into whether

19

fluoridation will cause popular anxiety.

20

If the government proposes to put massive

QUESTI0N«

But

Well, isn't the question here

21

whether the Act of Congress and Congress itself intended

22

that that be a subject of the inquiry, rather than

23

whether in fact anxiety is aroused by these problems?

24
25

HR. BATOR*

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

Our

contention is that the statute, properly read, does not

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

require the Commission to make such a subsidiary and

2

distinct inquiry into the question of stress.

3

On the other hand, the Court of Appeals of the

4

District of Columbia in this case held that it is not

5

enough to do what the Commission in this case did, which

6

is to engage in an extensive, an exhaustive inquiry into

7

the question of the safety of restart, taking into

8

account for that inquiry the painful lessons of TMI 2.

9

Rather, the Court ruled that apart from the

10

actual safety issue, stress resulting from fears about

11

safety is an independent factor.

12

QUESTION*

Mr. Bator, can I ask you about your

13

hypothetical?

14

this case, because there you are assuming an

15

environmental impact, namely, the fluoridation, and

16

psychological impairment of health as a result of an

17

environmental impact.

18

that wouldn’t be something you would look at?

It seems to me that is different from

19

MR. BATOR*

20

QUESTION:

21

22

23
24
25

Is that correct?

Are you saying

We are saying —
Then you are arguing that

psychological health is not health.
MR. BATOR*

No, Your Honor.

We readily

concede that psychological health is health.
QUESTION*

And you are saying, you don’t have

to look at it even if it’s caused by a change in the

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

environment?

2

brief makes.

3

That's a different argument than your

MR. BATOR:

No, our argument, Justice Stevens,

4

is that there are two sorts of health impairments,

5

including mental health impairments, that must be kept

6

distinct.

7

environment, and the intervention itself directly causes

8

health effects, including mental health effects, then

9

that consequential impact must be considered in the NEPA

10

If the government intervenes in the

process.
QUESTION*

11

Well, that is your fluoride case.

12

It seems to me that's your fluoride case.

13

may have picked a bad hypothetical.
MR. BATOR*

14

I think you

No, our argument. Your Honor, is

15

that the — maybe I — maybe another illustration would

16

help.

17

QUESTION*

I think maybe --

18

MR. BATOR:

Because the role in which mental

19

health can come in is if there is a direct, almost a

20

traumatic consequence.

21

proposes to build an airport, and there would be a

22

tremendous amount of noise which would drive people mad,

23

or if the government licenses an emission of lead that

24

will cause retardation among children, .then it seems to

25

us that that kind of mental health effect is like other

That is, if the government

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

health effects

2

The crucial distinction between that and this

3

case and the fluoridation case is the proposition about

4

fear and anxiety.

5

by the fear of an environmental impact counts as an

6

environmental impact.

7

We don’t think that anxiety produced

QUESTION?

What you are saying, I take it, is

8

that you don’t need committees and parades and pickets

9

to draw attention to the vibration and the noise of an

10

airplane going over at 300, 400, 500 feet or 1,000 feet,

11

and that that is quite a different thing.

12

ME. BATOR*

Yes, we believe it is quite a

13

different thing really for a number of very, we submit,

14

very profound reasons.

15

I would like to take it back to the statute,

16

because it seems to me that the key to this case is to

17

ask the question, what was the central concern, what was

18

the central focus of this statute.

19

This statute instructed the government to pay

20

more attention than it had heretofore done to the

21

impacts that governmental action has on the natural

22

environment.

23

some abstract way worried about the land and the water

24

and the air and plant life and animal Life.

25

the ultimate purpose in worrying about those phenomena

Now, that’s not because Congress was in

Of course,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

was to safeguard human health and human welfare.

2

But the central finding of NEPA was that

3

insensitivity to the natural environment was dangerous,

4

might produce dangers to man’s health and welfare.

5

Congress created a statutory structure that rather

6

insistently says that you must focus your attention on

7

the environmental impact of what it is you do.

8

9

And

The statutory structure, as it were, puts two
hurdles before the agency.

It says that the impact

10

statement is required only if the proposed action has a

11

significant impact on the human environment, and then,

12

importantly, the statute does not just stop there.

13

doesn’t say that all the effects of that impact must be

14

studied, only the environmental impact effects of that

15

action must be studied.

16

It

Now, we concede, Your Honors, that there is a

17

sense in which the restart of TMI

1 changes the

18

environment, and Respondent in this case argues from

19

that, well, they will restart TMI 1, and that is an

20

impact -- that is a change in the environment, and that

21

causes stress, but there is, we submit, a very critical

22

muzzle in that argument, because the stress is produced

23

not by the harmful consequences of the environmental

24

impact.

25

change in the water or the air which then produces

There is no argument here that. there will be a

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

stress in any kind of traumatic way.
'

The point that is being made is that the

3

stress is a product of people's anxiety and fear that

4

there may be a second accident here.

5

that they are worried about.

6

That is the impact

Now, we think that the statute does not

7

require for the government to make this separate and

8

subsidiary inquiry, and we think it would be extremely

9

undesirable from the viewpoint of the purposes of the

10
11

statute to require this subsidiary impact.
We submit that it would really dilute and

12

confuse the environmental impact process if this second

13

order, rather confusing question — see, you go through

14

the first inquiry, and you say, is this plant safe?

15

QUESTIONS

There is no question, is there,

16

that the impact statement would have to consider the

17

possibility of another accident?

18

HR. BATOR:

Yes, and in fact, did.

If Your

19

Honors will look' at the impact assessment that was

20

conducted in connection with this restart in the joint

21

appendix, there was an elaborate inquiry made into the

22

question of risk.

23

only certain impacts count.

24

consider the question of whether restart creates the

25

possibility of a second accident, and that counts,

That is, it is not our argument that
They have to, and we do

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

because if there is such an accident, there would be a

2

dreadful impact on the environment.

3

But we sharply distinguish between that

4

inquiry and the question whether on restart people will

5

be simply frightened of that accident, whatever actual

6

risks there are.

7

is that the intelligent way to deal with anxiety about

8

accidents is to do everything possible under the sun to

9

prevent them from happening, that is, that the rational

That is, our submission, Your Honor,

10

way to deal with anxiety is to make this unit safe

11

beyond a reasonable doubt, and to do it as openly as

12

possible so that everybody understands the facts.

13

But to underlay that inquiry with a separate

14

inquiry into the question of what people's subjective

15

perceptions with respect to safety are seems to us to

16

dilute the central inquiry, and we further submit that

17

it really has very little to do with the environment.

18

That is, anxieties are not — about safety are

19

not identical with, they are not even necessarily

20

parallel with concerns about the environment.

21

human anxieties about government interventions that are

22

relatively benign environmentally.

23

huge human anxieties about interventions that are not at

24

all benign.

25

There are

And there may be

In other words, there isn't a tracking between

11
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

the anxiety issue and the environmental issue.
Furthermore, the very process of the rule

3

announced by the Court of Appeals in this case, that

4

there must be — that there is a legal rule that

5

administrative agencies must make a formal inguiry in

6

order to predict stress seems to us to create a

7

confusing and diluting side issue into the real business

8

of these agencies, including their concern for the

9

environment.

10

That is to say that what will happen here is a

11

fiercely controversial struggle about proper

12

methodologies.

13

can't be measured, but it is difficult, and it is

14

controversial, and the methodologies for doing it are

15

extremely controversial, and what will happen here as

16

the opinion of the Court of Appeals stands, Your Honors,

17

we believe, is that there will be very, very elaborate

18

batteries of experts quarreling here, and a very rich

19

opportunity for complicated procedures and complicated

20

litigation about whether the proper methodologies were

21

used, and whether the predicted stress was correctly and

22

fairly measured.

23

He don't make the point that stress

Your Honor, I will take only one more minute

24

of your time.

I want to draw the attention of the Court

25

to the actual procedural history of this case.

This is

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C..20024 (202) 554-2346

1

not a case where shortly after the accident the Nuclear

2

Regulatory Commission said, well, let's start up this

3

other plant.

4

time, there has been an immense administrative

5

proceeding devoted to the question whether it is safe to

6

start it again.

7

That plant shut down in 1979.

Since that

There were hearings, interventions, written

8

submissions.

9

months.

The oral hearings themselves took nine

They generated a 26,000-page transcript.

These

10

hearings were devoted to the central problems of this

11

case, the questions whether it is safe to restart TMI

12

1.

13

of technical capabilities, of emergency planning, all

14

the other questions which the accident raised for TMI

15

1

16

These were questions of the design, of management,

.
It was in connection with these proceedings

17

that the Commission did -- was quite aware that it had

18

to — take account of compliance with NEPA, and it was

19

clear from the beginning that the stress question would

20

be a question here.

21

residents near Three Mile Island, called People Against

22

Nuclear Energy, was the principal party pressing the

23

submission that stress and anxiety was an independent

24

issue in this case, and they made contentions before the

25

Commission, and they were the ones that took the case to

Respondent in this case, a group of

13
ALDERSON REPORTINQ COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.

2

So, «hat we have here is this curious parallel

3

affair, the Commission engaging in this tremendously

4

complicated and scrupulous process devoted to the

5

question of whether this plant can safely be started up,

6

keeping in mind all the time that we think that that

7

kind of proceeding conducted fully in the open is the

8

most rational way to deal also with the question of

9

anxiety.

10

And then we have had this subsidiary,

11

complicated litigation devoted to the question whether

12

this other issue, this issue devoted entirely to

13

people's subjective perceptions with respect to safety,

14

is an independent issue, and that there is a legal right

15

to have that made an independent, formal subject of

16

inquiry.
QUESTION*

17

Mr. Eator, I think that I am having

18

some difficulty understanding the line that you want to

19

drwa here.

20

could be the proper subject of an inquiry in the case of

21

fluoridation of water or a lead poisoning situation, how

22

do you differentiate that from this situation?

23

the line that you draw in saying that it should be

24

considered in some instances but not others?

25

If you concede that psychological concerns

What is

Is it because in this instance you argue that

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-234S

1

it has been concluded that it it safe to physical health

2

to restart it, and therefore it is only the anxiety

3

factor?

4

What is —
MR. BATOR:

Justice O'Connor, the line we

5

would seek to draw and that we hope to persuade the

6

Court to draw is really the line that is given to us by

7

the statute.

8

statement must consider the environmental impact of

9

government interventions.

The statute says, the environmental impact

If health consequences are a direct product of

10

11

an adverse change in the environment as a result of

12

government intervention — that is our airplane case,

13

that is our lead poisoning case — then health effects

14

come in.

15

that the fluoridation anxiety is not the kind of health

16

effect that has independent status, because a stress

17

effect that is produced simply by anxiety about the

18

environment is not directly caused, as the statute

19

requires, by an impact on the environment.

20

On the other hand, we would argue fiercely

In other words, we really think that the

21

statute contemplates the wise policy that this

22

strung-out subsidiary mental health effect be restricted

23

to those situations where it is pretty clear that there

24

is an actual change in the water, or the land, or in the

25

air, that directly propagates some kind of mental health

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

change

2

QUESTION:

I take it that your — the other

3

side urges that without proving any change whatsoever in

4

the environment, or any threatened change, that anxiety

5

is —

6

HR. BATOR:

Yes, there are many, many

7

government actions that create anxiety.

8

government licenses a dangerous drug, that creates not

9

only anxiety, it creates an actual health danger, but

If the

10

the danger to health is not a product of an

11

environmental intervention, and therefore it isn't under

12

NEPA that those dangers must be considered.

13

If the government closes an Air Force base and

14

people are worried about unemployment, that is an

15

anxiety.

16

might go crazy with worry and fear as a result.

17

are a million ways in which the government affects the

18

anxiety level, but NEPA is a special statute.

19

deals with only one form of threat to man's welfare.

20

is not an all-purpose welfare statute.

21

If the government raises the tax rate, people

QUESTION:

It really
It

You would analogize this, I guess,

22

to building a prison.

23

be escapes and the like, but that is not an

24

environmental hazard.

25

There

MR. BATOR:

Neighbors are afraid there might

Re believe that people's anxieties

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

about the crime rate and about prison escapes are not an

2

environmental impact.

3

QUESTIONS

That is our submission.
Well, is the fact of escapes, the

4

possibility of escapes from a prison an environmental

5

impact?

6

MR. EATORs

The -- there is at least one Court

7

of Appeals opinion that has indicated, at least, that

8

that may be.

9
10

QUESTIONS

What is the government’s position?

MR. BATOR ;

The government is not absolutely

11

overjoyed by that proposition, but we think that in any

12

event it is wholly distinguishable from this one.

13

There is a -- There is a body of rather

14

intricate law under NEPA that deals with socioeconomic

15

and other actual consequences that are called secondary

16

consequences.

17

we would think that the statute requires that that kind

18

of socioeconomic effect come in only if it can be traced

19

direct to the environmental impact of the government

20

action, and that is why we have trouble in the case that

21

you gave, we have a hard time seeing exactly how it is

22

that there has been an adverse change in the natural

23

environment, but it is, I suppose, a case that one can

24

confound oneself with.

25

Even with respect to those. Your Honor,

QUESTIONS

Well, the line that you stated in

1

response to Justice O'Connor’s question like, I suppose,

2

most other lines, kind of blurs in places.

3

MR. BATOR:

Yes.

The government concedes that

4

there are hard cases, but we don’t think this is one,

5

Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

QUESTION:

So your short answer is that you

would oppose the construction of one 25 miles away?

NR. JORDAN:

I can’t tell you whether my

4

clients would oppose the construction of one 25 miles

5

away or not.

your position?

old plants?

Is there a limiting principle to

QUESTION:

12

MR. JORDAN:

Is it —
It is whether psychological

13

health damage can be expected to occur within that

14

environment, and I think the question here would be, it

15

would really be a matter of fact as to whether that had

16

the effect on these -- this population that TMI 1 has.

17

You have given the one example that no one else has to

population, but not with Three Mile Island Unit 1.

20

which is, what if you do the same thing to the same

QUESTION:

Even apart from the same

21

population, Mr. Jordan, in view of all of the publicity

22

that the accident had in Three Island, do you think the

23

people of the United States would have any substantially

24

less apprehension -- I am not talking ajoout all the

25

people, but some people -- about a new plant that is

proposed, or indeed about existing plants?

2

MR. JORDAN;

Well, in fact, I suspect that

3

generalized concern is greater than it was before Three

4

Mile Island — the Three Mile Island accident occurred,

5

but the question is not one of apprehension or even

6

fear.

I don't think there's another community — someone

8

living in Chicago or somewhere else —

And

I thought you --

-- there is no showing they would

be traumatized.

12

QUESTION;

I thought you had argued initially

13

that this health damage comes from anxiety,

14

apprehension, and fear.
MR. JORDAN;

15

The health damage arises as a

16

result of the physical change to that environment, and

17

there is — fear is one aspect of the cause of -QUESTION;

18

What evidence is there that this

19

physical change has occurred independent of what you had

argued initially, that it is anxiety, apprehension, and

fear generated by the fact of the accident?

HR. JORDAN:

10

Now I am talking —

From what?

From what?

From what these people lived

through when the accident occurred.

11

QUESTION:

Anxiety, apprehension, and fear.

12

MR. JORDAN:

Anxiety, apprehension, and fear

13

were doubtless among the causal relationships between

14

the physical occurrence of the accident and their

15

traumatization, and they may well have — in fact, they

16

probably did have exposure to low level radiation.
QUESTION:

17

Let me change Justice Powell’s

18

hypothetical.

Not 25 miles away, but suppose they

19

decide they are going to just make this Three Kile

20

Island, that whole plant a museum, close it except as a

21

museum, take all the dangerous materials out of it, and

22

let visitors come, but right alongside of it they are

23

going to build a new, presumably safer, modern plant.

24

Then, I put to you the question Justice, Powell put to

25

you.

Would you have the same objections to that new

MR. JORDAN;

I can't -- what all the

4

objections would be, I don’t know, but if the -- the

5

question would be, would psychological health damage be

6

caused, and I must say I expect that with this existing

7

traumatized population, the answer would be, yes, there

8

is a basis for saying in this case, as we see in no

examined in that situation, but that's a unique case of

MR. JORDAN;

QUESTION;

Kay I ask you a question?
Justice Stevens.
Supposing you had -- perhaps it is

an unlikely situation — but a restart situation, you

restart Three Mile Island, but assume that you could do

it in a way that would cause no effect on the physical

environment.

Say you had no smoke come out of the

Would you have a case then?

MR. JORDAN;

I think we would, and the reason

that we would is, you have assumed no effect

further and say no impact at all on the physical

Okay.
How do you get within the statute

Right.

MR. JORDAN;

You remain in that environment

you conclude there is zero potential, just

MR. JORDAN;

Justice Stevens, we have

making that argument.

Our -- the allegations that have to be considered as

11

assuming that it were in some way absolutely impossible

12

for that to happen, I think that you still have the

physical change to the environment by virtue of the

is that you don't.

Well, that is my — my hypothesis
That's my hypothesis.
