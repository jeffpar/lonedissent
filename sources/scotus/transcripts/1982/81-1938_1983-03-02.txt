ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Wallace.

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case which is here on the government's petition

8

to the Seventh Circuit presents a question concerning court

9

authorized and court supervised disclosure of grand jury materials

10

to the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Rule 6(e) of the

11

Rules of Criminal Procedure.

12

Several issues were litigated below, but we confined

13

our petition for certiorari to a single issue, not because we

14

agree with the Court of Appeals' decision regarding all of the

15

other issues, but because we wanted to present the Court with

16

the issue of greatest importance administratively and the issue

17

that reflects a long-standing practice of many years in the

18

issuance of Rule 6(e) orders by district courts.

19

The case arises out of a special grand jury investi­

20

gation of commodity futures trading transactions before the

21

Chicago Board of Trade.

22

related criminal violations of the Commodities Exchange Act and

23

of the Internal Revenue Code and was assisted by Internal

24

Revenue Service agents as well as other personnel to help in

25

the analysis of the information that was being secured.

The grand jury was investigating

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

The grand jury proceedings itself with respect to Mr.

2

Baggot culminated in a guilty plea, which was accepted — a plea

3

of guilt

4

Exchange Act, violations that involved participation in rigged

5

commodity trades that produced substantial paper losses, which

6

he deducted in preparing his tax return, and yet he recovered most

7

of those losses in the form of cash kickbacks from his trading

8

partners.

9

that have implications for tax purposes.

10

to misdemeanors for violations of the Commodities

So, the guilty plea was based on a theory of violations

After some preliminary proceedings which are not

11

important for purposes of what is before this Court, the United

12

States Attorney sought disclosure at the request of the chief of

13

the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service of the

14

grand jury materials for their use by the Service in determining

15

whether there was a deficiency in Mr. Baggot's tax return.

16

the question we have presented is a question that arises under

17

Rule 6(e)(3)(C)(i) whether the disclosure that was requested here

18

that would be permitted in the absence of authorization by the

19

Court is disclosure that would be directed by a court preliminarily

20

to or in connection with a judicial proceeding.

21

And,

The answer is to be secured principally from analysis

22

of the language in legislative history of this provision as it

23

was reenacted with a textural rearrangement in 1977.

24

proceeding to that, I wish to make a few observations to put the

25

question in some perspective in assessing the language in
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Before

1

legislative history.

2

The first is, perhaps the too obvious point, that we are

3

not dealing here with a situation that involves any taint or

4

impropriety on the part of the government.

5

the grand jury was conducted as it was authorized to be conducted,

6

and the participation of the Internal Revenue Service agents was

7

in no way improper.

8

and, as a matter of fact, because this grand jury investigation

9

commenced before the recent amendment of Rule 6(e) -- the 1977

The investigation of

It is specifically provided for in Rule 6 (e) ,

10

amendment, there was an order by the court authorizing the

11

Internal Revenue Service agents to participate, to assist the

12

grand jury and the United States Attorney in analyzing the

13

evidence that was being secured.

14

purpose was attempted to be made of this information except upon

15

application to the court to secure the proper court order under

16

Rule 6(e).

17

And, no use for any other

So, we are not dealing with any sort of taint or imprope:

18

conduct from that standpoint.

19

for what has been referred to as abuse of the grand jury, whether

20

or not it is a term of art.

21

Nor, is there a basis in this case

The fact that there had been a guilty plea accepted in

22

the case certainly indicates that the grand jury was not being

23

used as a subterfuge for a non-criminal purpose.

24

face of it is there any injustice in the idea that when evidential

25

materials have come forth which indicate not only a violation of

Nor, on the

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

criminal law but also a deficiency in the payment of taxes that

2

are owing.

3

to see to it that those taxes are paid by Mr. Baggot as they would

4

be by any other taxpayer.

5

Nor, there is certainly no injustice in taking steps

From the standpoint of what seemed to be the concern of

6

Congress in 1977 when it recodified this Rule, a concern that a

7

safeguard be included against a cat's paw type of use of the

8

grand jury to obtain evidence for civil purposes and only for

9

civil purposes in ways that were not authorized to the agencies

10
11

to obtain their evidence —
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I notice the way you put that.

12

I would suppose you would think you could use the grand jury for

13

dual purposes as long as you had a bona fide criminal investi­

14

gation going on that you could conduct a parallel civil investi­

15

gation using grand jury material?

16

MR. WALLACE:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. WALLACE:

That is my understanding.

That is the government's position?
It is also my understanding of what this

19

Court said in Proctor & Gamble.

20

a case called United States against Kordel, 397 U.S. 1, where the

21

complaint was made the other way around that the civil investi­

22

gation was being used to secure information that would be used

23

in the prosecution —

24
25

QUESTION:

It said much the same thing in

Has it not some times happened that informa­

tion from one of the civil — one of the non-criminal divisions
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

not secured by discovery but just their own investigation, then

2

might be referred to the Criminal Division for prosecution when

3

some lawyers in the Division make a judgment that there is

4

criminal conduct involved?
MR. WALLACE:

5

It happens quite frequently, and I believe

6

it is the duty of those lawyers when they see evidence that a

7

crime has occurred to turn it over to the prosecuting attorneys —
QUESTION:

8
9

Is it not a fact that they might be violating

some federal statute if they didn't, is that not so?
MR. WALLACE:

10

I would not want to go that far, but an

11

argument could be made to that effect.

But, it certainly is a

12

common practice not only for attorneys within the Department of

13

Justice but in the agencies and departments to do that.

14

this Court has many times referred to the fact that the Internal

15

Revenue Service refers matters to the Department of Justice for

16

criminal prosecution.

17

dealing with the enforcement of Internal Revenue summonses which

18

are to be used prior to these referrals and not subsequently.

19

But, the discussion always assumed that it was a proper function

20

to make the referrals to criminal prosecution when evidence of

21

wrong-doing was found.

And,

It has been a criterion used in cases

The fact is many statutes impose law enforcement duties,

22
23

both criminal and civil, on attorneys and others for the govern­

24

ment.

25

Congress had in the safeguard that it wanted to provide that the

And, while I do not wish to denigrate the concern that

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

grand jury not be subverted to uses wholly for a civil purpose.

2

I think the danger of that can easily be exaggerated.

3

From where I stand within the government, the complaint

4

that we hear most of the time from the departments and agencies

5

is that they cannot get the U. S. Attorneys to use the grand jury

6

as often as they would like to pursue the criminal violations

7

that the departments and agencies think they have uncovered because

8

grand juries are time consuming and resources are limited and the

9

use of the grand jury has to be rationed.

While we do not in any

10

way advocate not observing the safeguard that Congress intended in

11

this Rule, we do not think there is a great danger that the

12

United States Attorneys are subject to manipulation for use of

13

the grand jury for civil purposes.

14

all they can do to use it for all of the criminal cases that might

15

warrant its use.

16

at least.

17

In most instances, they have

That is the experience we are having these days,

The other — before we proceed to the language and

18

legislative history at issue here — the other perspective that

19

I think is useful to keep in mind is whether the application

20

that was made by the Internal Revenue Service here poses any of

21

the dangers to the integrity and efficacy of the grand jury

22

process itself that this Court has observed from time to time.

23

We set forth on pages 31 and 32 of our brief, the five

24

standards of the Rose case that this Court twice approved. Because

25

the grand jury proceeding had been completed here and particularly
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

because it had been concluded with a guilty plea, it is only the

2

fourth of these standards that could possibly have any relevance

3

here, the encouragement of free and untrammeled disclosure by

4

witnesses, by persons who have information with respect to the

5

commission of crimes, or as the Court said in Proctor & Gamble,

6

to encourage all witnesses to step forward and testify freely

7

without fear of retaliation.

8
9

There are two possible impediments to look toward under
this criterion.

One is whether the danger of personal liability

10

might discourage a witness from testifying freely, and that seems

11

unlikely in this context if a witness, even himself not the target,

12

were to disclose that he was a party to tax fraud, or engaged in

13

tax fraud himself.

14

be disclosed to the IRS for civil purposes, it could possibly

15

lead to criminal proceedings against that witness for tax fraud.

16

Regardless of whether that information could

It is hard to see that there is a substantial additional

17

deterrent placed on the witness if he knows that it might also

18

lead to an assessment of a tax deficiency against him for collec­

19

tion purposes.

20

With respect to the possible retaliation from employers

21

or other persons because the witness disclosed a wrong-doing that

22

he knew about, this is something that has already been disclosed

23

in the grand jury to attorneys for the government, and because

24

under 6(e) the further disclosure would be under the protection

25

of a court order and would be requested by the United States

MR. WALLACE:

Well, they could request it.

Of course,

17

the judge himself would be aware of any sensitive material of

18

this sort, and the United States Attorney could participate.

19

There are cases that have held that requests by administrative

agencies for materials to be used in an administrative hearing

are not within the coverage of 6(e).

report of the House hearings, and this is during Judge Becker's

I can come to answering Justice Stevens' question — "that in my

used civilly if there was no bad faith.

In light of that and there were repeated references to

5

the IRS in his testimony and other testimony and repeated

6

references to his other opinion, the Hawthorne case as well as

7

the Pflaumer case, he was a witness because he was the author

of two of the more extensive opinions at the time.

that, there is added significance to the portion of the Senate

In light of

11

relied on these hearings and did not conduct its own hearing that

12

we have reproduced on pages 28 and 29 of our brief in which they

13

said quite explicity there was no intent to preclude the use of

14

grand jury developed evidence for civil law enforcement purposes.

15

On the contrary, there is no reason why such use is improper

assuming that the grand jury was utilized for the legitimate

purpose of the criminal investigation.

The Hawthorne citation which we have discussed in some

detail in our brief takes on added significance in the fact that

in context it is suggestive that Judge Becker's views themselves

were being endorsed including the views that he gave to the

Committee in testimony.

It is his opinion and

opinion.

3

looked at, but it is the portion that approves of the civil use

4

of the grand jury materials in this particular anti-trust investi­

5

gation because there was no finding that the grand jury proceeding

6

was used as a short cut to goals otherwise barred and more diffi­

7

cult to reach.

It is not the portion of the opinion that is generally

The Court was quite explicit in saying what was occurring
here, that the suit was filed on the heels of a grand jury

investigation in which no indictment was returned.

ment is using the grand jury transcript to prepare the civil case

12

for trial, and appellees who are defendants in that suit desire

13

the same privilege.

14

that there was nothing wrong with the government's doing that and

15

that a private party, and the Court was very careful to limit its

discussion to a private party, has to make a showing of parti­

much in this argument.

2

MR. WALLACE:

They did not specify what the purpose was.

3

The language was carried over from the earlier draft of the Rule,

4

of the 1946 draft, where it was really designed for a somewhat

5

different purpose.

6

court supervision into the picture because defendants were trying

to interview grand jury members to get information with which to

QUESTION:

So, anything the IRS wants to do is

preliminary to litigation, I think.
MR. WALLACE:

If the grand jury materials are relevant

12

to a tax investigation, then there is a sufficient likelihood

13

that a deficiency will be assessed and that litigation will

We are not here to decide the most efficient or the most

The Court recognized that a liberal disclosure policy

House Committee that was considering the 1977 amendments to the

2

6(e) rule, and the concern was not as Solicitor Wallace says, the

3

concern was if we give administrative agencies this information

4

for criminal purposes as they are allowed to do, the concern was

5

that there would be leakage back to those agencies so that they

6

would use it for unrelated civil purposes.

7

When questioned about that, Professor LaFave said unless

8

it was a matter most critical to their undertaking and unless they

9

could demonstrate that they had no other comparable way of obtaining

10

this evidence, they could not get to the evidence under the

MR. BETAR:

Yes, sir.

I think it is a two-prong test.

of a competing interest among other things, and the second test

MR. BETAR:

I think, is if you file a deficiency notice that should be a

sufficient time for them to come in and say it is preliminary to.

But, what I think will happen if this Court establishes that kind

of test is IRS will run right around end..

MR. BETAR:

No, I am saying that that stage may be

reached at some critical stage within IRS procedures, but I cannot
define — but we certainly have not reached it in Baggot.

Justice O'Connor, you are getting me into

I know about Sells is that if this Court accepts any lessened

there was not any routine disclosure at all.

Mr. Wallace is right when he says there is nothing in the history

No, sir.

That is right.

Even in Judge Becker's —

That was your position.

Well, that means

there is no preliminary to at all.

11

MR. BETAR:

Your Honor, even in Judge Becker's opinion

12

in Hawthorne, which the government relies on, he said if the IRS —

13

and we are talking about IRS there — had access for criminal

14

purposes, their future access — those were his words — would

follow as- though there had been no access at all.

What you are doing is giving IRS a partnership in the grand jury
