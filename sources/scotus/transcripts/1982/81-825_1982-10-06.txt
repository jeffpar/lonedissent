ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANCIS J. McCONNELL, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MC CONNELLs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

9 please the Court, this case involves the scope of
10 protection under the immunity statute.
11

As Your Honors well know, that statute

12 provides that no use or derivative use may be made of
13 compelled testimony.

The issue presented by the

14 petition is whether Mr. Conboy's deposition testimony,
15 which repeats verbatim or closely tracks his immunized
16 grand jury testimony, can be used against him in a
17 subsequent criminal prosecution.
18

This case arises out of the corrugated

19 antitrust litigation.

In 1978, indictments were brought

20 against a number of major paper companies, alleging a
21 price-fixing conspiracy in violation of the anti-trust
22 laws in the corrugated container industry.

Mr. Conboy

23 is a former employee of the Weyerhaeuser Company, one of
24 the defendants in that action, and the petitioners in
25 this case are purchasers of corrugated containers who
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 opted out of the class action.
2

How following the indictments in 1978 there

3 were a series of class and civil actions filed in
4 various district courts throughout the land.

Those

5 actions were consolidated in the Southern District of
6 Texas before Judge Singleton.

In the course of

7 discovery in the class litigation the District Judge,.on
8 motion and the necessary showing of compelling and
9 particularized need, released certain grand jury
10 transcripts, including that of Hr. Conboy.
11

Later, in May of 1981, Petitioners, pursuant

12 to subpoena, in Chicago took the deposition or attempted
13 to take the deposition of Mr. Conboy.

15 transcript.

We had his grand

Mr. Conboy had a copy of the

His lawyer had a copy of the transcript.

16 And the examination took the following format.
17

He had testified before the grand jury under

18 immunity that he had exchanged prices with Dick Herman
19 of Alton Boxboard.

The first questions

Mr. Conboy,

20 with whom at Alton Boxboard did you exchange prices?

He

21 evoked the Fifth Amendment.
22

Next questioni

Is it not a fact that you

23 exchanged prices with Dick Herman of Alton Boxboard?
24 Again, the witness invoked the Fifth Amendment.

Third

Did you not so testify in January of 1978?

You used the phrase "so

What's the frame of reference there?

MR. MC CONNELL:

The reference back to the

prior question, that you had fixed prices or you

6 exchanged prices with Dick Herman.
7

QUESTION:

Well, are we to understand that the

8 examiner was — had the transcript of the grand
9
10

jury

testimony in front of him?
MR. MC CONNELL:

11

had the transcript.

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

I was the examiner.

I

I'm reading verbatim questions —
It's perhaps of some importance

13

whether it was directly from that transcript or whether

14

it was from some other information, is it not?

15

MR. MC CONNELL:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

I

16

thought I mentioned that we all had copies of the grand

17

jury transcript.

18
19

QUESTION:

But having copies two weeks before

and having copies right in front of you at the time is

20 perhaps — perhaps — different, but you say the
21

examination was conducted with the transcript in the

22 hands of the examiner.
23

MR. MC CONNELL:

24

QUESTION:

25

In my hands, Your Honor.

But you were asking him — you may

have been reading the questions from the grand jury

MB. MC CONNELLi

3

QUESTION*

4

But you were asking him for his

recollection at the time you were examining him.

5

MR. MC CONNELL;

6

QUESTION:

7

Yes, of course.

Did he have a copy of the

transcript?
MR. MC CONNELL;

8
9

Yes.

He had a copy of the

transcript; his lawyer had a copy of the transcript.
QUESTION;

10

But you weren't asking him whether

11

that was his recollection then.

12

now, then, what his recollection was about the

13

price-fixing.
MR. MC CONNELL:

14

Yes.

You were asking him

That would be the first

15

question.

The first question;

16

Boxboard did you have price conversations?
QUESTION;

17

With whom at Alton

Suppose you hadn't had the

18

transcript at all and had never had it and you asked him

19

this question and he took the Fifth Amendment?
MR. MC CONNELL:

20
21

22

That's a more difficult

question.
QUESTION:

Well, more difficult.

It isn't

23

difficult at all, is it?

He would be entitled to take

24

it if there was a realistic threat of criminal

25

prosecution.

Not according to the Eighth

3 let's take your situation,
4 Borden case

The Eighth Circuit says —
Mr. Justice White.

In the

5 also, hut Borden follows Starkey also in the Eighth
6

Circuit — there were two witnesses.

7 not have a copy of
8 a series of

The examiner did

the grand jury transcript.

He asked

questions which presumably were areas that

9 were covered in the grand jury testimony.

The witness took the Fifth to those series of

10

11

questions.

A motion to compel was made.

12 reviewed the grand

jury transcript in camera and he said

13 these questions are within

the confines of the prior

14 immunized grand jury testimony.
15 not.

The Court then

These questions are

Answer the questions that are within the

16 confines.

You don't have to answer the questions that

17 are outside.

QUESTION*

18

So it really didn't make any

19 difference that you were reading from the transcript?

MR. MC CONNELL*

20

21

Well, if you go as far as the

Borden case, it doesn’t make any difference, but if you

22 limit yourself to Fleischacker and the panel decision
23 below, it is important that you have the transcript.
24
25 see if

QUESTION*

Now along that same line, let me

I can get clearly what you’re saying.

If you had

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

never seen the transcript in your life but were simply

2 aware that he had been before a grand jury at some time,
3

would you have asked these questions?
QUESTION:

4
5

Well, if you were suing for

price-fixing you would.

6

MR. MC CONNELL:

7

QUESTION:

Your Honor —

That’s what you’d be probing for,

8 wouldn’t you?

MR. MC CONNELL:

9

QUESTION:

10

11

Exactly.

Even if you didn’t know that he’d

ever been before a grand jury.
MR. MC CONNELL:

12

Exactly.

We know that the

13

grand jury investigation involved price-fixing in the

14

corrugated box industry.

15

key employee dealing with other corrugated box

16

manufacturers involving major accounts.

17

probabilities were that he had exchanged prices.

18

yes, I think I would have asked many of the same

19

questions.

20
21

We know that this man was a

The
So

But that doesn’t answer the problem yet
because I did — in your hypothetical I didn't have a

22 copy of the transcript and —
23

QUESTION:

To go beyond that, in the

24

hypothetical the questions would not have been derived

25

from immunized testimony.

MR. MC CONNELLs

1

2 questions.

But —
QUESTIONS

3

Well, certainly not my

If you didn't know what the

4

immunized testimony was, how could you have been using

5

it?

6

Here you know what it was.
MR. MC CONNELL:

Here I know what it was and

7

clearly, to the extent I asked question verbatim or

8

closely tracking, it's derived.

9

presuming what was asked, but I don't know that and it's

10

11

In the other case. I’m

not directly ierived from the transcript.
But when the witness refuses to answer on

12

Fifth Ameniment grounds and then the Court reviews in

13

camera the transcript and says these are areas which

14

were examined on before the grand jury and you must

15

answer these questions, then it seems to me that that is

16

a compelled repetition of immunized grand jury

17

testimony..

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. MC CONNELL:

20

QUESTION:

21

But it’s in a civil action.
It is in a civil action.

And since the grant of protection

of the immunity statute is limited to a criminal action,

22 why does the immunity statute have anything to do with a
23
24
25

civil action?
!1R. MC CONNELL:

The Fifth Amendment and the

co-extensive use immunity protection protects you
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 against usa of that testimony only in a criminal action
2 but you can invoke the Fifth Amendment in any action —
3 civil or criminal.
4

QUESTION:

Certainly.

But conceding that, wh

5 does the use of the immunity statute play any part in
6 your argument with respect to testimony adduced in a
7 civil case?
8

MR. MC CONNELLi

Because the respondent’s

9 position is that a prosecutor may get hold of this
10 deposition where he has repeated his same immunized
11 grand jury testimony and use that as a wholly

12 independent source.
13

QUESTIONS

In a later criminal case.

14

MR. MC CONNELLi

15

QUESTION;

In a later criminal case.

11 is just as though there never

16 had been any grand jury testimony or anything else and
17 that you have him on the witness stand in a civil case
18 and you ask him a question that may incriminate him in
19 some future criminal case, so he can take the Fifth

20 Amendment.
21

MR. MC CONNELLi

That’s right, if he doesn’t

22 have immunity.
23

QUESTION;

Yes.

24

QUESTIONS

If you try to use it in a criminal

25 case, that’s the time to stop it.

KB- MC CONNELL

No, I don't think so, Your

2 Honor.
3

QUESTION:

Well, if an objection was made,

4 could it be used in a subsequent criminal case?
5

NR. MC CONNELL:

6

QUESTION:

7

NR. MC CONNELL:

No, absolutely not.

So that's -The question is could this.

8 Court make the determination prospectively that that
9 evidence would be tainted, and we say clearly it could
10 and we also rely on the dicta in Patrick in the Seventh
11 Circuit.
12

QUESTION:

Hell, suppose there is no

13 subsequent criminal prosecution?
14

MR. KC CONNELL:

I’m sorry.

I missed your

15 question.
16

QUESTION:

If there is no subsequent criminal

17 prosecution, it couldn't be used.
18

MR. MC CONNELL:

If there's no subsequent

19 criminal prosecution, it can't be used.
20

QUESTION:

But how does the harm come ahead of

21 the criminal prosecution?
22

MR. MC CONNELL:

Because the question is

23 whether the witness can be compelled to testify over his
24 Fifth Amendment assertion and the Court said — the

25 Court said you can be compelled because you have compete
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 protection because no use can be made of this civil
2 deposition testimony.

Where you confine the examination

3 to the four corners of the grand jury immunized
4 testimony, where you repeat verbatim or you closely
5 track, you are protected.
6

And we can make that determination today.

7

QUESTION*

Following up on Justice Rehnquist's

8 point about the civil action, the interesting thing
9 about the way this arises is that if this man were to
10 answer the questions, he is now arguing that they are
11 not protected.

But then if he were later indicted he

12 would then take the exact opposite position and argue
13 they were protected, I would assume. •
14

QUESTION*

That's right.

15

MR. MC CONNELL:

16

QUESTION:

I would think so.

So his interests change in the

17 different proceedings.
18

QUESTION*

Well, the whole problem could be

19 solved by just not giving out grand jury testimony, I
20 would think.
21

MR. MC CONNELL*

22

QUESTION*

23

MR. MC CONNELL:

Well --

You know, to plaintiffs.
Well, we wouldn't have the

24 transcript if the transcript hadn't been released,
25 that's true.
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

Well, and all you're doing is

2 malting it available to civil plaintiffs really.
3

MR. MC CONNELL:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MC CONNELL:

I don’t think that's true.

As a discovery tool.
Justice Rehnquist, we are not

6 suggesting that the test announced by this Court in
7

Douglas Oil be in any way relaxed.

The Plaintiff still

8

has the burden or the party seeking release of grand

9

jury transcripts still has the burden of meeting the

10

compelling and particularized need test, and that's a

11

balancing test, balancing the need for disclosure

12

against the continuing need for secrecy.
We are not suggesting that that test be

13
14

relaxed in any way.

15

transcripts were released, and now the question is what

16

use we can make of those transcripts.
QUESTION:

17

That test was meant here — the

Yes, sir.

Well, all you -- I suppose the only

18

showing you made is that you wanted some testimony.

You

19

wanted some basis — you said you brought a civil suit

20 and this would be useful in the civil suit.

MR. MC CONNELL:

21

22 simple.

What happened —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MC CONNELL:

25

Well, I don't think it's that

What else could you say?
Well, the showing that was

made before Judge Singleton -- and this goes back to
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 January of 1980 — was that there had been a massive
2 invocation of the Fifth Amendment and that meaningful
3 discovery had been blocked by reason of the Fifth
4 Amendment assertions in this litigation, and the judge
5 issued a memorandum order.
6

QUESTION;

Well, if we affirm, then you'd

7 never be able to get the grand jury minutes then again
8 on that basis because it wouldn’t do you any good to
9 have them.

You could still take the Fifth Amendment.

10

ME. MC CONNELL:

If you affirm, whether we

11 have the

grand jury minutes or not is not going

12 any good

because we can't compel his testimony.

13

QUESTION; Exactly.

14

MR. MC CONNELL;

to do us

That's why I want you to

15 reverse.
16

QUESTION;

Exactly.

But if we affirmed, you

17 wouldn’t be able to get any more grand jury minutes by
18 saying everybody's taking the Fifth Amendment.
QUESTION; I thought

19

that's what you had

20 responded to in response to my questions, that even if
21 you had never known about this, didn’t have a copy of
22 the transcript, the questions you would put to this
23 witness would likely be parallel to those presented to a
24 grand

jury, but he would still have the protection of

25 the Fifth

Amendment, wouldn't he?
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. KC CONNELLs

1

He would have the protection

2 of the Fifth Amendment in that situation.

But what the

3

Borden court said was that if he invokes the Fifth

4

Amendment to the question or series of questions and the

5

Court, on in camera inspection of the grand jury

6

transcript not released to the parties, determines that

7

these questions were in fact touched upon in the grand

8

jury examination, that he then can be compelled to

9

answer over his Fifth Amendment objection.

10

And they say in that situation he is protected.

11

QUESTION*

I suppose we can also have the

12

situation where the testimony is originally elicited at

13

a grand jury investigation and use immunity is granted

14

by the government to the witness and then the witness

15

testifies within the use immunity at the criminal trial

16

and you still have the question of trying to use it in

17

the civil case.
Now there it's not a question of getting the

18
19

grand jury testimony at all, but don’t you have the same

20 problem ?
21

HP. MC CONNELL*

22

QUESTION*

23

MR. MC CONNELL;

24

QUESTION*

25

Yes.

And did that happen here?
No.

Mr. McConnell, in any of these

cases that you referred to has the government taken a
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

position on the issue?

It is interesting,

They don't

2 file any kind of an amicus brief.
3

HR. HC CONNELL:

4

2UESTI0N:

5

No, they have no t.

Could the government c ome in in the

civil proceeding and grant use immunity aga in, although

6 the government’s not involv ed?

HR. MC CONNELL;

7

Well, they could, but they

8 have not, and they have declined to.

There is no

9 companion civil suit by the government here.
In the Folding Carton Litigation which

10
11

preceded the Corrugated Litigation, the government did

12 do that.
13

They had a companion civil suit and they did

grant immunity in connection with the discovery

14 depositions in
15 with
16

the class actions which were consolidated

the government’s civil action.
QUESTION:

Thera was no —

As I understand it, the government

17 makes the practice under this use immunity statute of
18 going in every time

the witness appears any place and

19 getting another use

immunity grant, isn’t that right?

20
21

HR. HC CONNELL:

Well, that’s one of the

arguments of the respondent, that the fact that the

22 government granted separate immunity both in the
23 interview statement and later when the witness appeared
24 before the grand
25 appeared in

jury and in the case of witnesses who

the criminal trial, again they granted it.
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

And I think, there's two very — first of all,

2 obviously I don't know what was in the mind of the
3

government, but I think there are two very practical

4

answers or reasons for that having been done.

5

defense counsel, out of an abundance of caution,

6

demanded and said if you want testimony from my witness

7

you are going to have to grant him immunity.

8
9
10
11

One,

Secondly, if the government wanted to go
beyond the confines of the earlier examination, then
they would want the witness immunized again.
QUESTION!

Well, Mr. McConnell, I gather what

12

you want us to say is the use immunity which he received

13

in connection with the grand jury testimony carries over

14

to this deposition in the civil case.

15

MR. MC CONNELL:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, provided —

But is there anything at all in the

17

legislative history to suggest that Congress intended

18

that statute to apply to civil as well as criminal cases

19

or appearances before the grand jury?

20
21

MR. MC CONNELL:

I think the legislative

history indicates -- and this Court's decision in

22 Kastigar indicates -- that that statute was to be
23

construed as broadly, as sweepingly as possible.

24

Indeed, this Court in Kastigar said it provides a

25

sweeping protection against any use or derivative use of
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

compelled testimony

2

QUESTION;

3

So you read "sweeping” as carrying

all through subsequent civil proceedings and such?
MR. MC CONNELL;

4

So long as the subsequent

5

civil proceedings are confined to the four corners of

6

the —

7

QUESTION;

Of the transcript.

8

QUESTION;

Well, that would just read out the

9

word in any criminal case from the use statute.

10

MR. MC CONNELL;

11

QUESTION;

12

No.

What we're saying is —

Well, the position you've just

taken would weed out that language, wouldn't it?
MR. MC CONNELL;

13

I don't think so, Mr. Justice

14

Rehnquist.

What I'm saying is if we produce a carbon

15

copy of the grand jury testimony on civil deposition,

16

can the government use that civil deposition in a

17

subsequent criminal proceeding against the witness.

18

that's what we say the statute prohibits.

19

the derived or derivative use of the original immunized

20

testimony in a down-the-pipe subsequent criminal

21

proceeding.
QUESTION;

22

And

It would be

That conforms with the language of

23

the statute, but I thought you were trying to apply it

24

here to —

25

MR. MC CONNELL;

No, no.

All we're saying is

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

But assuming that it is sealed sealed, and nobody

QUESTION:

9

MR. HC CONNELL:

10

Therefore, he couldn't use it.

QUESTION:

That's right, and maybe —

Your point is he might get it from

11 an independent source, in which event he could use it.
12

MR. MC CONNELL:

In that situation he might be

13 able to get it from an independent source and he could
14 establish his Kastigar burden.

15

QUESTION:

He could use this testimony from

16 the grand jury in a subsequent criminal prosecution in
17 spite of the statute.

Is that your position?

18

MR. MC CONNELL:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MC CONNELL:

21 Marshall.

No.

No way.

Well, that' s the way you are.
I ion 't believe so. Justice

The statute and this Court's holding in

22 Kastigar say that a prosecutor in a subsequent criminal
23 prosecution against Mr. Conboy, one, cannot use the
24 immunized testimony itself, nor can they base their case
25 on any evidence or fruits derived from that immunized
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

testimony, nor — to carry it a step further — can they

2 base their prosecution on the deposition which just
3
4

repeated that testimony.
QUESTION;

My only trouble with you is when

5

you say you can't use the fruit does not say the fruit

6

can 't grow.

7

MR. MC CONNELL;

Well, I think this Court's,

8 decision —
9
10
11

QUESTION;

Or the fruit can't exist.

All the

statute says is it can't be used.
MR. MC CONNELL;

Exactly, Your Honor.

It is

12

not transactional immunity.

13

theoretically subject to prosecution, assuming that the

14

prosecutor can show that his evidence came from a wholly

15

independent, legitimate source -- not from this

16

deposition and not from the grand jury testimony.

17

All right.

18

QUESTION;

Mr. Conboy always remains

Mr. McConnell, I think what

19

concerns me most about this — about your position — is

20

that probably the use immunity statute that was passed

21

by Congress was passed by Congress in an effort to help

22 the government lawyers — the prosecutors -- to avoid
23

having them lose other means of going after somebody in

24

a criminal case just because of an overbrick of the

25

transactional immunity that has been used.
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. MC CONNELL:

2

QUESTIONS

I agree with that.

And I doubt if Congress was

3 thinking of benefitting civil litigants when it passed
4 that statute.

Now the danger of letting you use it, it

5 seems to me, is that in the process of using it,
6 although the government prosecutors are not involved,
7 somehow that use immunity will get widened, although the
8 government wouldn't like that because the witness is in
9a bad position.
10

The witness presumably has to be

11 cross-examined and maybe it gets wider and wider and
12 wider, and all of a sudden the government is losing the
13 benefit of some testimony that it didn’t want to lose.
14 Now how do you respond to that?
15

MR. MC CONNELL:

Well, the answer to that, I

16 think, is that so long as the deposition examination is
17 confined to the four corners of the grand jury immunized
18 examination, there is no expansion.
19

QUESTION:

Okay, but how do you do that within

20 the framework of giving cross examination?

Otherwise,

21 presumably the evidence can’t come in anyway.
22

MR. MC CONNELL:

I understand.

There is

23 nothing which prevents the defendants in this situation
24 from cross examining as to details of the direct
l

25 examination.

We are assuming here that the scope of the
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 direct examination is confined and limited to the scope
2 of the immunize! examination.

In turn, there is no

3 reason why defendants cannot conduct meaningful cross
4 examination within the confines of the direct
5 examination.
6

They can ask details -i— who, where, when, how

7 many times.

They can ask exculpatory testimony.

Hell,

8 now, you said you had this price-fixing conversation
9 with Dick Herman where you agreed that you would both
<10 raise your prices.
11 your prices?

But isn't it a fact that you cut

You said you were both going to honor each

12 other’s prices.

Isn't it a fact that both of you cut

13 each other's prices?

That’s cross examination.

That’s

14 meaningful cross examination, but that's clearly within
15 the scope and confines of the direct examination and
16 does not expand the immunity grant, which -17

QUESTION*

No, but I suppose, Mr. McConnell,

18 that in such a cross examination question it would be
19 possible that the cross examiner would bring out
20 information that could not reasonably have been derived
21 from the confines of the original testimony and,
22 therefore, that broadened examination might go beyond
23 the scope of the use immunity.
24

MR. MC CONNELL;

Well, if the examination goes

25 beyond the confines and the answer is potentially

So he*s really faced with a choice

in the case of every single question that deviates even

lawyer standing right there beside him to decide whether
he should claim the Fifth or not.
HR. HC CONNELL;

I don't think it's that

*

12

difficult, but we've gotten rulings from the Court in

13

this case before and there's no reason that we couldn't

14

get rulings again, and, as a matter of fact, in this

15

very case, Fleischacker is Second Circuit.

16

Fleischacker case came down, the opinion came down, we

17

went back and we took Fleischacker's deposition and I

19

20

the grand jury testimony.

21

After the

22 asserted the Fifth Amendment.

No attempt was made to

compel answers over his Fifth Amendment assertion, and

24

in a motion in limine in this litigation the defendants

25

moved to strike the Fleischacker deposition on the

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ground that they’d been denied meaningful cross

2 examination.

3

Judge Singleton ruled in pretrial order

4 PTO-69 — pre-trial order 69/ which we have supplemented
5 the record with -- he ruled that the defendants were
6 entitled to cross examine as to details, that the

7 appropriate procedure was a motion to compel, and had
8 they done that they could have had meaningful cross

9 examination.
On the other hand, if the cross examination

10
11

clearly goes beyond the scope of the direct and the

12 immunized and is collateral

to,

that is not a denial of

13 meaningful cross examination, and that is not grounds
14 for striking his direct examination and we cite the
15 Court to Cardilla — U.S. versus Cardilla -- on that
16 point.
17

QUESTIONS

In the posture of this case or this

18 type of case, isn’t your examination of someone who has
19 appeared before the grand jury generally a cross
20 examination — really,
21

22

although you are the first to

question, it’s really an adverse witness.

It is.

OR A. L ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. COFFIELD, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3

MR. COFFIELDs

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

4 please the Court, although I am here today on behalf of
5 John Conboy, in fact I think, Your Honors, that really
6

Mr. Conboy is a representative almost in a class sense

7 of many, many deponents and witnesses before not only
8

this antitrust grand jury that started back in 1976 and

9 resulted in one criminal case, one civil class action
10

case, and this opt-out case, but he is representative of

11

witnesses throughout the country in multi-defendant and

12

large investigative .cases, and I have represented many

13 of them and, as Mr. McConnell has himself, these
14 depositions have taken all sizes, all forms and all
15 shapes.
16

The panel majority, it seems to me, says, as

17 it does precisely at the conclusion of its opinion, the
18 thing that Mr. McConnell throughout his briefs and his
19 argument I would, with all due respect submit, has never
20 answered, and that is the Court says there are just too
21

22

many uncertainties.
If Kastigar reads the use immunity statute and

23 supports it as a constitutional statute, and as we have
24 applied Kastigar and defense counsel for all these
25 witnesses who are individual counsel for these
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 witnesses, represent to them that what Kastigar means,
2 as this Court has said, is that yes.

While we think

3 that the Fifth Amendment and the use immunity must be of
4 the same scope an! we should read it broadly, the fact
5 is that it is use immunity and it is not transactional.
6

And, therefore, the source, if it is a

7 separate source, if it is an independent source, may ■
8 well be the source of new information, testimony that
9 would be incriminating.

And if you look at it on the

10 scope, at one end of the spectrum you have Mr. Conboy's
11 concern that if one has to wait to the application of an
12 exclusionary rule down the line, as this Court has
13 frequently said, that is not the same as the Fifth
14 Amendment to simply apply an exclusionary rule.
15

If one has to look down the line to the

16 judgment of the discretion of a prosecutor — will he or
17 will he not, in the State of Ohio, for example, decide
18 because of an unlimited statute of limitations he is
19 going to have his own antitrust investigation, his own

20 possible indictment of Mr. Conboy and others, because
21 Mr. Conboy lil business down there, or will some judge
22 that's not any longer Judge Singleton but some other
23 District Judge, in reading the spectrum of questions
24 that go beyond the actual immunized testimony, say I
25 will cut it here.

I think at this point he may have
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 waived or at this point it may be beyond the derivative
2 use concept.
3

So that our submission really is very clear

4 and very simple, and that is that for Hr. Conboy to be
5 certain of the scope of his Fifth Amendment rights and
6 for a reaffirmation of Kastigar, which we think the
7 panel majority clearly did, and that in conjunction with
8 the way the government does this every time, that each
9 testimonial situation — be it civil or criminal, be it
10 interview, grand jury, criminal trial, civil deposition
11 or civil trial or next grand jury — Mr. Conboy and all
12 of those witnesses that he represents are entitled to
13 claim their Fifth Amendment right because the source not
14 of the questions, as we point out in our brief and the
15 panel majority indicated, not of the questions -- the
16 source is not the questions.
17

The source is the answers and, therefore, for

18 certainty and in the ability of the witness to know the
19 scope of his Fifth Amendment and to keep the scope of

20 the Fifth Amendment and the statute the same, as the
21 Court has indicated it must be, each time he testifies,
22 he is entitled to claim it because each testimonial
23 situation might be a new use.
24

Sow you take the one end of the spectrum.

25 What Hr. McConnell wants to do is to say I bring out the
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 transcript ani

I give it to you, Hr. Conboy — as he did

2 on the day of his deposition -- and this is now the

3 grand jury transcript and I have got it and you have got
4 it, and now I am going to read to you.

Did you say

5 this; did you say that?
And to make that one relatively simple, he

6

7 could say in one guestion if I were to read you all of
8 the guestions and all of the answers in your grand

jury

9 transcript, would your answers today be the same to
10 those questions,
11 yes,

and Mr. Conboy could theoretically say

Mr. McConnell, despite the fact that Judge

12 Singleton in

this new pretrial order 69 has said I am

13 not going to allow in grand jury transcript to be read
14 into this trial except for cross examination of actual
15 witnesses.
16

But all of a sudden Mr. McConnell is going to

17 have us transfer what is impermissible under the Federal
18 Rules of Evidence and Judge Singleton has already said
19 I*m not going to let that in, by Mr. Conboy answering
20 the question
21 verifiable,

yes, it all of a sudden becomes now more
somehow a better class of testimony, and he

22 is going to let it in.

23

Now the tough question for me at that point

24 is, and Justice Marshall suggested this, can anyone
25 seriously claim that Mr. Conboy's one answer "yes" might
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

somehow be — subject him to criminal prosecution later

2 on.

And I would submit to Your Honors that given the

3

fact that criminal prosecution is still possible and

4

there's been no real argument in this case that it is

5

still theoretically possible —
QUESTION:

6
7

The issue really isn't whether

another criminal prosecution is possible.

Let's assume

8 it is.
9
10

MR. COFFIELD:
QUESTIONS

Right.

The question is whether the answer

11

"yes” in your example would fall within the statutory

12

language of being information directly or indirectly

13

derived from such testimony.

14

MR. COFFIELD:

15

QUESTION:

Isn't that the issue?

That's right.

Your submission is that the

16

question that your opponent asked of him was derived

17

from it, but the answer was not even indirectly derived

18

from the grand jury transcript — the information

19

contained in the transcript.

20
21

MR. COFFIELD:

I would say. Your Honor, that

clearly — and I'm trying to give myself the hardest

22 case, clearly — that it is difficult for me to argue
23

that is isn't indirectly, but there are a number of

24

differences.

25

QUESTION:

Why is it hard to do that?

They

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 are asking him for his present recollection.
2

MR. COFFIELD:

3

QUESTION:

That’s right.

That's my point.

You are not asking him for what

4 your recollection was then.

You are saying what is it

5 not, and that certainly isn’t derived from his grand
6 jury testimony.
7

MR. COFFIELD;

8 Justice White.
9

Exactly,

What I am saying is —

QUESTION:

10 quite so fast.

And that’s not.

Well, but let’s not leave that

Is it not true that it’s indirectly

11 derived from the other testimony, even though it isn’t
12 what he testified to before?

You found out about it

13 indirectly by knowing what he testified to before.
14

MR. COFFIELD:

15

QUESTION:

No, I submit not.

And if you were defending him in a

16 criminal case you would not be willing to argue that
17 that testimony was the fruit of the grand jury testimony?
18

MR. COFFIELD:

Ah, well, as you pointed out

19 before, that’s the connundrum and the Catch-22, if you
20 will, that Mr. Conboy’s going to be put in unless this
21 Court affirms, because Mr. Conboy in fact, yes, will
22 have to say that be is entitled to his Fifth Amendment
23 right because it’s a new source — a new answer, a
24 present recollection of something that happened four
25 years ago -- and then, if he is compelled and he does
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 say yes and some prosecutor down the line says but I
2 have an independent source — it’s a new yes and it's
3 today’s yes — and I’m going to bring an indictment, I’m
4 going to have to turn around, and so does Hr. Conboy,
5 and say well, now, since it is in fact going to be held
6 either to be excluded under the exclusionary rules or
7 it’s going to be held to be indirect, I now am going to
8 take your position.
9

QUESTION*

So it’s a fruit of the poison tree.

10

HR. COFFIELD *

11

QUESTION*

Exactly.

Supposing you had a coerced

12 confession case where Hr. Conroy had been hauled in by
13 the police and subjected to brutality and he gave a
14 transcript that confessed to a crime.

Then later on he

15 was asked again did you so confess -- the same questions
16 you’ve got here — and he’s say well, my present
17 recollection is such and such.

And you say the present

18 recollection has not been indirectly derived from the
19 earlier testimony?

You say that’s not a fruit of the

20 earlier confession?
21

HR. COFFIELD*

22

QUESTION*

It is not, because —

Because it’s his present

23 recollection rather than what he testified.
24

HR. COFFIELD*

It is not only present

25 recollection but the problem with it is that in addition
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to it being present recollection, the moment you add

2 anything else to my spectrum or to the level of
3

questions --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. COFFIELD:

It is not an indirect fruit.
You are in an area where who

6

knows where you are going to stop.

And without meaning

7

this disrespectfully, from the point of view of Mr.

8 Conboy, we don't care how Your Honors decide this,
9

because if you tell us on the one — what we want is

10

certainty.

So if you tell me on the one hand, all

11

right, Kastigar means every time you are entitled to

12

use, at that point Mr. Conboy and every other witness

13

will do it the way we do it with the government every

14

time, and Mr. McConnell is going to have to look to his

15

own presentation of his case, however he may find it.

16

On the other hand, if Your Honors say well,

17

we’ll go all the way -- and effectively I would submit

18

that goes back to Justice Marshall’s dissent in

19

Kastigar, which was effectively to say once you give up

20 the transactional concept you found yourself in this
21

hornet’s nest — go all the way and say everything that

22 relates to the corrugated container industry from the
23

years X to Y is going to be seen, and this Court will so

24

say, as derivatively and indirectly related to the

25

questions of this testimony, as far as I am concerned
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that's fine too, because then we'll sit down and go for

2 five days.
3

QUESTION*

But you pose two possible decisions

4

of this Court, hut those two aren't the only ones.

You

5

could get a decision somewhere in the middle, which I

6 suppose wouldn't please you so much.
7

MR. COFFIELD*

Well, I submit, Your Honor,

8 that if Your Honors come down somewhere in the middle it
9

is fraught with uncertainty and it is fraught with

10

constitutional concern, and the reason it is is because

11

what you would effectively be doing, it seems to me, if

12

you coma down anywhere in the middle, is going against

13

cases like Manusk, against cases like Murphy v.

14

Waterfront -- against the cases which have said the

15

exclusionary rule remedy is not the same as the

16

constitutional privilege and the statutory immunity

17

that's related to it.

18
19

The exclusionary rule remedy is to clean it
up — de facto immunity — some judge later saying well,

20 all right, Mr. Conboy went this far and now I've got to
21

22

look at it -QUESTION:

Well, what if you just had a rule.

23

It might not make a lot of sense, but at least it might

24

be clear that as long as you are reading a guestion from

25

the grand jury testimony and he gives the same answer
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ani the judge is following it, that there is — that he

2 must answer that question, because there’s immunity.
3

But if you stray a word from the grand jury testimony,

4

than you cm take the Fifth.

5

6
7

8
9

SR. COFFIELDs

Well, I would pick up on Your

Honor’s statement of that.
QUESTION*

I think that —

That’s the equivalent of your

hardest case.
SR. COFFIELDs

That’s my hardest case, but it

10

seems to ma the problem with that hardest case is that

11

while the courts have made it clear that the immunity

12

does not protect you from perjury, there is a question

13

with respect to whether or not your present recollection

14

on these case-by-case questions is the same.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Well, you might be perjuring

yourself again because you’d answer —
SR. COFFIELD:

That’s right, and he is

18

entitled, I would submit, Your Honor, he is entitled not

19

to perjure himsalf again and to take the Fifth Amendment

20 with respect to that.
21

QUESTION:

Well, I didn’t know immunity

22 protected you against perjury.
23

MR. COFFIELD:

It doesn’t.

The case is where

24

you in fact by giving an answer, a new answer, would be

25

indicating that a past answer was perhaps perjury, that
35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

you are protected against doing, as you are from making

2 any statement that would in any way incriminate you.
3

So while — if you perjure yourself within —

4

once you’ve been given immunity, you are not protected

5

from prosecution.

6

QUESTIONS

You say the second testimony the

7

guy has a right to claim the privilege against

8

Mr. Coffield, the only interest you

That’s correct.

Supposing the Ohio Attorney

MR. C3FFIELD

You bat I would, and that by a

2 Court’s ruling that does not affirm this panel below is
3 the Catch-22 that Mr. Conboy’s put in.

He’s got to then

4 be on both sides of this question, depending on who’s
5 doing the asking.
6

QUESTIONS

Let me put the question to you that

7 I put to your friend.

Mr.

McConnell.has no transcript.

8 No transcript was issued in a jurisdiction, in a circuit
9 where it is not allowed.
10

MR. COFFIELDs

11

QUESTION*

Yes.

But if he's an experienced lawyer,

12 as he is, he’s going to ask.

He’s going to be able to

13 surmise what the testimony was.
14

MR. CDFFIELD:

He’s going to come pretty

15 close, sure.
16

QUESTION*

Now, then he puts the questions to

17 the witness which very closely track the testimony he
18 gave before the grand jury.

And what does your witness

19 do?
20

MR. COFFIELDs

Well, he does the same thing.

21 He takes the Fifth Amendment.

The irony of that is that

22 if you take Mr. McConnell’s argument that it doesn’t
23 depend on, as I think must be implied in what he’s
24 saying, it doesn’t depend on what comes out of Mr.
25 Conboy’s mouth, then you have the reverse situation.

40

Even if Mr. McConnell just fortuitously asks

2 the same guastions in the same order, even though he

>

3

never had a copy of the transcript, in fact under his

4 theory it might also ba derivative usa, it might also be
5 protected.

But I think that would be a ludicrous

6 result, because in the cases like Kuehn, in the cases
7 like Brown, the lower — the Court of Appeals who have
8 looked at it clearly have indicated that a new source, a
9 new statement, is a new entitlement to claiming the
10 privilege, because that otherwise might be used and the
11 use would then subject him.
12
|F

So that in fact what would happen is that Mr.

13 Conboy would continue to claim his Fifth Amendment
14 right, and the mars fact that he happened to have the
15 transcript in front of him, or Mr. Conboy happened to
16 have the transcript in front of him, shouldn't make a
17 difference.
18

And we submit that because it is current

19 recollection, because it is in fact within the very
o

CM

statements made by Kastigar, it's the effort to say that

21 the scope of the immunity is the same as the scope of
22 the Fifth Amendment privilege and that in any
23 circumstance in which there might be an extension of
24 that the usa is nat usa by civil attorneys, it is the
25 usa by the prosecuting attorneys of the information

the subject of all kinds of other appeals and other

they are looking at an immunized transcript and there is

no use they can make of that because so far there's been

no extension of it.

20

QUESTION;

21

But the fact of the matter is that, now that the

And now

What safeguards are put on these

grand jury transcripts?

It seems to me that's the root

22 of the problem here.
23

MR. COFFIELD;

I would submit, at least in the

24

experience I've had before Judge Singleton — and I

25

think Mr. McConnell would agree with this -- that the

42

court there and the court in other cases I've been

both through security in

offices and checkout systems and what have you, to make

4

sure that only the parties, be it the counsel or in

5

certain cases counsel and an expert witness or counsel

6 and one representative of the client — that there is
7

very limited access.

And I think the courts have in ■

8 fact been fairly careful about it.
9

The whole question of whether or not there is

10

an effect on Mr. Conboy, Your Honors will recall Mr.

11

Conboy was joining an appeal made to this Court for

12

certiorari that was denied because we did take the

13

position that had our transcript not been turned over we

14

wouldn't even be here.

15

at the time.

16

through the Fifth Circuit on that issue and then cert

17

was denied.

He objected at the time, and it came up

But certainly this goes to your question, Mr.

18
19

And we thought it was improper

Chief Justice, that the fact of the turning over of

20 these transcripts -- Mr. McConnell says he doesn't make
21

much use of them.

I would submit that there's a great

22 deal of use of them made other than the need, as he
23

claims, to get them in somehow into the courtroom in the

24

trial.

25

But with respect to the interest of Mr. Conboy

and all these other witnesses, the principal use that is

2

made of them are these series of depositions, which we

3

submit are going to extend and subject him to

4

substantial risk.

5

is not just a mere possibility.

6

any movement down that road, any answers that go beyond

7

that immunized transcript, even the affirmation, put Mr.

And it is not just frivolous and it

12

to handle it, or analyses by other judges and other

13

prosecutors of what is indirect.

14

And I would submit that that whole series of

questions leaves Mr. Conboy, who is the one that started

out here with this constitutional right, in tremendous

uncertainty.

Are you?

10

(Laughter.)

itself.

And the reason I think you can, Your Honor, is

Why, that proves it.

It was a

dissent.
MR. COFFIELD:

Well, that's right.

But now is

18

the chance, Your Honor, because if this Court reaffirms

19

Kastigar — and Your Honor, with all due respect, can

20

see that if Kastigar is affirmed, and the Government's

21

been living by it and we’ve been living by it as defense

22 counsel or witness counsel,

that each testimonial

23

situation is entitled to separate protection.

If we gat

24

that separate protection, we’ll testify until Mr.

25

McConnell is all through.

The Government, it's clear in all the cases.

2 the Government is the one that has the discretion to
3 come in there and decide.

And if the Government wanted

4 to get beyond that criminal trial and made a
5 determination it was in the public interest to have Mr.
6 Conboy testify, I believe we'd find the Government in
7 there saying, okay, I'll go down to Judge Singleton and
8 I'll give him a petition.

And I am sure Judge Singleton

9 would sign that order as fast as the ink would dry, and
10 we'd be down there -11

QUESTION:

Well, is there statutory authority

12 for the Government to give immunity to a witness to
13 testify in a private case?

when —

It'd be a change in policy.

Division didn't use to just hand out stuff to private

8 litigants, did it?
9
10

MR. COFFIELD*
QUESTION*

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

Did the Antitrust Division just

11

hand out information to private litigants as a result of

12

their investigation?

13

change in policy, wouldn’t it?

14

I mean, I think this would be a

MR. COFFIELD*

No, the Government, with

15

respect to the release of. grand jury information and so

16

forth, I think the Government has, with all due respect

17

to the Government, been on both sides of that fence.

18

mean, sometimes they see it's of some benefit, they've

19

got private treble damage claims; and sometimes they

I

20 have other fish to fry and so they don't want to do it.
21

So it seems to me they change.

22

One of the areas, though, that is suggested by

23

the Court's questions is — and this is going to come up

24

as a constitutional question -- if Mr. Conboy were a

25

defendant in the criminal case down the road, and now

47

1 Mr. Conboy says, and I want Joe Gluntz, who you've not
2 given immunity to, to be given immunity, because under
3 Brady he's got all kinds of exculpatory information, and
4 the Government says, no, I'm not going to give him
5 immunity.
6

So far the court has said that's still a

7 Government discretionary policy.

But from the

8 standpoint of witnesses, it is not wholly unlike the

9 proble with respect to defendants, that we have to look
10 to the Government, and if they're not here I submit Mr.

I’ve got to then say it’s indirect and it’s derivative.

12 I

don't think it is, but I would then --

6

I think when we go back to the beginnings of
this, and even under the Immunity Act of 1954, the

7 Allman case, Judge Frankfurter I think said it best and
8 adopted language in

Mathie of Judge Magruder and said:

9 "If it be thought that the privilege is outmoded in the
10 conditions of this modern age”
11

— as Mr. McConnell is

really suggesting to us — "then the thing to do is take

12 it

out of the Constitution, not to whittle it down by

13 the subtle encroachments of judicial opinion."
14

And I suggest that Starkey is a subtle

15 encroachment, and Fleischacker's a subtle encroachment,
16 and that the panel majority said:

No, Mr. Conboy and

17 others like him are entitled to certainty, and the
18 certainty can only be the reaffirmation by this Court of
19 Kastigar and the affirmance of the panel below.
