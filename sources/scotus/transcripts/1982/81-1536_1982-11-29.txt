ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court;
This federal income tax case comes here on a

11

writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals

12

for the Fifth Circuit.

13

question dealing with the tax consequences of the

14

disposition of property subject to a mortgage.

15

Court of Appeals in this case allowed a loss, based upon

16

a cost that Respondents did not incur and turned out

17

never would incur, and thereby reached a result that we

18

believe to be totally at odds with the economic reality

19

of the transaction.

20
21

It presents an important

The

The facts are relatively simple and can be
summarized as follows;

22

In 1970 Respondents formed a general

23

partnership for the construction of an apartment project

24

in Duncanville, Texas.

25

mortgage loan of $1.85 million.

They obtained a nonrecourse
By "nonrecourse," that

1

ineant that none of the borrowers on the note bore any

2

personal liability for the loan but that the lender bank,

3

could look only to the security of the property secured

4

by the mortgage.
In 1971 and 1972 the partners, of which Mr.

5

6

Tufts was one, contributed approximately $40,000 j_n cash

7

to the general partnership.

8

applicable tax rules, which the parties stipulate to be

9

correct, a proportionate share of their $1.85 million

And they included under the

10

debt in each of their bases of their partnership

11

interests.
In 1970 through 1972, when the partners held

12
13

the project, they claimed approximately $440,000 of the

14

tax deductions which represented depreciation and other

15

losses in connection with the operation of the apartment

16

project.

17

not at issue in this case.

Those deductions were entirely proper and are

In August 1972 the partners disposed of the

18
19

property subject to the mortgage to an unrelated third

20

party.

21

been any amortization of the principle balance on the

22

mortgage debt.

23

the entire period of their ownership at $1.85 million.

24

And at the time of disposition, the basis of the

25

taxpayers* partnership interests had been reduced

At the time of this disposition there never had

because of depreciation to $1.45 million.
Now, this transaction came under audit by the

2
3

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and he determined that

4

Respondents had realized gain of approximately $400,000

5

as a result of the disposition of the property.

6

computation of gain was by reference to the amount

7

realized by the Respondents in this case, the $1.85

8

million loan, which the unrelated party picked up on the

9

transfer of the property subject to the mortgage minus

The

10

their bases of $1.45 million, which yields approximately

11

$400,000 in gain.
This case came to the Tax Court on

12

13

Respondent's petition for review, and the Tax Court

14

upheld the Commissioner's determination and, in so

15

doing, followed a uniform line of authority above the

16

Tax Court and of the other appellate courts .

17

situation like this, a disposition of'property subject

18

to a mortgage requires that when the mortgage has never

19

been amortized down at all, that the amount realized on

20

the disposition of property include the unpaid mortgage

21

balance .

And in a

The Court of Appeals, however, in this case

22
23

reversed.

It limited the amount realized to the value

24

of the property that happened to be at the time of

25

disposition, which was $1.4 million.

And it did so

1

despite the fact that the property was transfered

2

subject to a debt well in excess of this amount; that

3

is, $1.85 million.
But the value of the property, we submit, has

4
5

absolutely no significance to the tax consequences of

6

such a transaction.

7

taxpayer’s determined to transfer the property along

8

with the debt, the value of the property is only

9

relevant to the new owner and the lender who must look

to that value of the property for satisfaction of his

11

loan.

12

QUESTIONi

Mr. Smith, isn't what the Court of

13

Appeals did quite consistent with the intimation in the

14

Crane footnote?

15

MR. SMITH;

No, we don't -- no, Mr. Justice

16

Rehnquist, we don't think it is consistent with the

17

intimation in the Crane footnote, as I shall point out

18

in greater detail.

19

was to, by way of dictum, express a reservation that

20

they weren't dealing with the facts of the case that is

21

now before the Court.

22

All we think that Crane footnote did

I don't think that the intimation in that

23

footnote is necessarily tantamount to a rule of law that

24

when the value of the property --

MB. SMITH:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
No, I agree with you, but how much

3

practice and usage among the tax bar and th e courts that

4

decide tax cases, more often than we, has g rown up in

5

reliance on the idea that what you have des cribed as ”a

6

dictum” is at least —
MR. SMITH:

7

Absolutely not.

The practice and

8

usage is directly to the contrary.

I think that it*s

9

fair to say that the tax bar, both public a nd private,

10

has always regarded that footnote, as I sha 11 point out

11

in greater detail, as simply a response to the economic

12

benefit analysis that the court engaged in. in part, in

13

Crane.

14

But we submit, and the Courts of Appeals,

15

apart from the court below as well as the T ax Court, has

16

consistently held both before Crane and sin ce Crane that

17

the fundamental aspect of the Crane princip le is the

18

relationship, the functional relationship, between basis

19

and amount realized.

20

is that since that basis is cost and it req uires — that

21

implies an economic outlay.

22

case, the Respondents borrowed 51.85 millio n on a

23

nonrecourse basis.

24
25

And basically, our su bmission here

And in this pa rticular

Crane, the principle of Crane all ows you to
include that loan balance in basis for purp oses of

7

1

depreciation or any other purpose, purposes of computing

2

gain on ultimate disposition.
But the quid pro quo of including that in

3
4

basis is that at the other end of the transaction, that

5

mortgage balance has never been paid, you have to

6

account for it at the other end of the transaction.

7

other words, the notion is that basis is economic

8

outlay;

9

borrow money and count it as basis, if they never pay

that is, cost.

In

And while we permit someone to

10

any of that money, there has to be a reconciliation of

11

the accounts at the other end.
The footnote in Crane didn't dispute what we

12
13

think is the logic of that.

14

decision, the rationale of the Crane decision, we

15

submit; that is, putting, establishing a functional

18

relationship between basis and amount realized requires

17

that there be this reconciliation of accounts at the

18

disposition of property the way it occurred in this case.
QUESTION:

19
20
21

And in fact, the Crane

Why do you think Footnote 37 is

there?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I think footnote -- there

22

has been a lot of ink spilled on this, Mr. Justice

23

Blackmun, and I could only perhaps summarize it, you

24

know, in a few sentences.

25

Footnote 37 is there, I mean I think what happened in

I suspect that the reason

1

Crane is that the court engaged/ in part, in what the

2

commentaries refer to as an "economic benefit

3

analysis."

4

Justice wrote was that, wall, that Mrs. Crane got some

5

kind of economic benefit.

6

the court, in order to arrive at that result, the court

7

had to equate her nonrecourse mortgage with some sort of

8

recourse liability.

And they, one of the things that the Chief

And in so doing that, what

9

And it was able to do this because she

10

conceded in the case that if the amount had been

11

recourse, if the liability had been recourse, of course

12

she would have been required to take it into account.

13

But she strenuously urged that the nonrecourse aspect of

14

the debt made the case different.

15

Well, what the court said was, well, that

16

wasn't really true in this particular case because the

17

value of the property exceeded the mortgage balance.

18

in a situation like that, the court equated recourse and

19

nonrecourse debt.

20

the analysis, the court wanted to indicate that perhaps

21

that wouldn't be the case, that aspect of the analysis

22

wouldn't apply if the numbers were reversed.

23

So

Ani then because of this aspect of

But I think that everyone since that time has

24

indicated that the economic benefit analysis of Crane is

25

really not the heart of Crane, and it's not -- the Crane

principle stands on the logical bedrock of a

2

relationship between basis and amount realized, and that

3

if the code permits you to be deemed to have made an

4

economic outlay and you get basis for this outlay even

5

though you borrowed funds and you haven’t actually put a

6

dime out of your pocket, but implicit in that notion is

7

that you will ultimately pay some money and if you don’t

8

ultimately pay some money the way Respondents did in

9

this case, well, then -- then there has to be a

10

reconciliation.
And in fact, in thinking about this case, it

11
12

seemed to me, if you sort of strip it of all its

13

essentials,

what it really boils down to is suppose one

14

ere to buy a suit from a department store and charge

QUESTION;

17

MR. SMITH:

18

QUESTION:

The example is

No, you're just bootstrapping.
No.
You're saying the Crane principle

19

just covers this case like a blanket even though it was

20

reserved.

21

MR. SMITH:

I am suggesting, and I think that

22

the decisional laws, apart ftom the decision in this

23

case, is uniformly to the effect that really the

24

reservation in the case only dealt with the economic

25

benefit aspect of the analysis.

QUESTION:

1

You’re bound to get around to

2

saying, why is -- why did this seller here, why did this

3

seller realize anything?

4

HR. SMITH:

5

QUESTION:

6

What did he realize?

You’ve got to

say what, determine what amount he realized.
MR. SMITH:

7

8

Well, he —

Right.

We say he realized $1.8

million.
QUESTION:

9

MR. SMITH:

10

And why?
He realized $1.8 million because

11

he borrowed $1.8 million, the code gave him basis for

12

tha t.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SMITH:

Yes.
At the other end of the

15

transaction, he had not amortized that debt, he had not

16

paid out one bit, and somebody else is going to pay that

17

debt.

18

that point the tax law has to say, well, how do we

19

reconcile these accounts?

20

given you basis during the stewardship of your ownership

21

on the assumption that you were going to pay out

22

something.

The property goes along with the debt.

And at

We’ve been assuming, we’ve

So what you’re really saying is

that he realized something when he took the deduction?
MR. SMITH:

Well, I don't think I am really

saying that because —

You want to get it —
MB. SMITH;

deductions back.

Well, we don't want to get the

In fact --

QUESTION;

6
7

But you want to get it back.,

You're going to pay gain on the

deduction.
MR. SMITH;

8

Well, I think the response to that

9

is that the numbers here are fairly comparable, given

10

the fact that the property is practically 100 percent

11

financed, and the debt has not been amortized one

12

penny.

13

going to be a rough comparability between the deductions

14

taken, which represent, guote, a recovery of capital, so

15

to speak, and --

16
17
18
19

20
21

22

In a situation like that, of course there's

QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, suppose there’d been no

deductions taken at all.
MR. SMITH;
exactly the same.

What would your position be?

It'd be exactly the same.

It’d be

And in fact --

QUESTION;

Would there be any gain realized?

And if so, what would it be?
MR. SMITH;

There would -- well, I suppose if

23

there were no deduction, if there were no deductions

24

taken, there would be no -- then in that case, the

25

taxpayers' partnership bases would be $1.85 million.

2

MR. SMITH;

Yes.
But -- and his amount realized

3

would be 51*85 million, in which case there would be

4

gain or loss.
QUESTION;

5

6

So you are saying that the

deductions constitute the gain, in effect?
MR. SMITH;

7

In effect.

Well, we don’t think — in effect,

8

in a rough way.

But let me emphasize the fact that

9

we're not recapturing deductions.

And I think that the

10

best way to illustrate this is by assuming that there

11

were no — that there were no deductions and that, for

12

example, let’s assume that the property in this case was

13

nondepreciable.

They transfer the property

Under the Court of Appeals opinion in this

21

case, and I don't think there can be any quarrel about

22

that, they, the Respondents would have a $400,000 loss

23

because their basis would be 1.85 and their amount

24

realized would be 1.4.

25

Now, it is absolutely bizarre, to say the

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

least, how people in a situation like that could have a

2

$400,000 loss.

3

And in fact, in this particular case, the error of the

4

court below, it seems to us, is confirmed by the fact

5

that the Court of Appeals gave the Respondents an extra

6

$50,000 of loss; that is, equal to the difference

7

between their $1.45 million basis and the $1.4 million

8

fair-market value.

They haven't expended a single penny.

This is the modern equivalent of the miracle

9
10

of the loaves and the fishes.

How can there be a loss

11

here?

12

temerity even to claim that loss, although they did

13

claim it in the courts below, and their support of the

14

decision below necessarily supports the rationale that

15

upholds such a loss.

And in fact, the Respondents no longer have the

In our view, this is an aberration that

16
17

doesn't fit with Crane and doesn’t really fit with any

18

-- anything logical that one can imagine the code to

19

allow .

20

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, why wouldn't the

approach taken by the amicus Barnett solve your problem?
MR. SMITH:

It would solve the problem to an

23

extent. Justice O'Connor, but our response to that

24

simply is that over the last 45 years, property

25

transfered with liabilities has always -- has always

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

been considered by — by the Treasury to be transfers of

2

the property along with the liability.

3

bifurcate these things in that way.

4

QUESTION:

You don't

Do you take the position that the

5

Treasury Department could subsequently decide to

6

approach it exactly that way; that that’s within —

HR. SMITH;

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. SMITH;

I think it would —
— the framework of the statute?
I think it would be a radical

10

transformation.

It would -- it would -- I think it

11

would be contrary to -- to all the assumptions that have

12

proceeded from this Court’s Crane case.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. SMITH;

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Would it be —
And that’s why —
-- consistent with the statutory

structure to take that view?
MR. SMITH;

One can read the statute the way

18

the amicus reads the statute.

However, the Treasury has

19

for the last 50 years read the statute to impose capital

20

gains in a situation like this one.

21

Treasury's reading of the statute is a permissible one,

22

and given the fact, the deference that the — such

23

administrative constructions are given to -- by the

24

courts in general and by this Court, we feel that the

25

proper result here is the imposition of capital gains on

And we feel that

QUESTION*

Let me ask you a hypothetical.

If

3

the purchaser here had paid the taxpayer $1.4 million in

4

cash for this property free and clear --

5

MR. SMITH:

6

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.
-- and the taxpayer had then taken

7

that $1.4 million and paid the secured party the 1.4 in

8

full satisfaction of the $1.8 million debt, I assume you

9

would recognize then that the amount realized on the

10

property was the 1.4 million, not the 1.8?

11

MR. SMITH:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SMITH:

No.
No?
I think it would still be 1.8.

14

Essentially, and in fact, it seems to me that the income

15

there -- I mean, you know, there's obviously gain in the

16

situation like that when you discharge a $1.8 million

17

liability with a $1.4 million piece of property.

view is that that's —

But it doesn't occur on the sale of

the property, does it?
MR. SMITH:

Well, but you know, it's part and

22

parcel of -- I mean I think the Commissioner would take

23

the position that since the liability secured the debt,

24

it's part and parcel of the same thing, without meaning

25

to make a pun, and that that would still be -- I mean

your position as applied to Crane itself?

2

the facts of Crane, where you have inherited property,

3

the property had been disposed of at a time when its

4

fair-market value was below the amount of indebtedness.

5

You would still say there that the heir would have a

full gain as to the extent of the indebtedness?

say, would have been decided the same way if the

22

The problem -- the problem simply is that
there are a lot of strands in Crane.
QUESTION:

But your loaves-and-fishes argument

is not very persuasive when you have inherited property.

23

MR. SMITH:

24

QUESTION:

25

Although Crane --

Yes.
Someone inherits property and

inherits no obligation, but the property is encumbered,

20

and then they dispose of it by just abandoning it.

2

suddenly realize a gain in the amount of the

3

encumbrance, under your view?

4

MR. SMITH;

They

Well, right, although tax lawyers

5

have no problems with that sort of thing only because --

6

but the point is that —

7

2UESTI0N;

No, but --

8

MR. SMITHi

-- if you get -- if you get basis

taxpayers do, wouldn't you say?
MR. SMITH;

That's true — that's simply --

15

that's true, although we think -- we think in this

16

particular case where the concept of basis requires an

17

economic outlay either now or sometime, here where the

18

Respondents have paid not a penny other than the small

19

cash contributions that they made to the partnership, it

20

seems absolutely anomalous, to say the least, that they

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. SMITH;

1

Yes, that is true, Justice

2

O'Connor.

And the reason for that is simply that the

3

Internal Revenue Service has, I think soundly, taken the

4

position that when value of property is way below a

5

nonrecourse debt, there have been a lot of tax-shelter

6

activity in which the nonrecourse debt bears no

7

relationship to the property.

8

circumstances, the Internal Revenue Service has taken

9

the position that at the very most,

11

QUESTION;

Under those

It's just a little hard to

12

understand how the basis of the property would be the

13

lower figure but what the seller received is a higher

14

figure.

15

MR. SMITH;

Hell, I don't think it really is

16

hard to understand if one -- if one looks at it from the

17

seller's point of view, the seller put $1.8 million in

18

his pocket.

19

that it declined in value has absolutely no significance

20

to him economically if ha’s allowed, if he’s permitted,

21

if he does, transfer the property along with the debt so

22

that the debt is of no interest to him and the value of

23

the property is of no interest to him.

24
25

He then bought this building.

The fact

And it really is very much like the suit in
the department store; you're just not interested in the

glaringly calls for the reversal of the judgment below.

There's been no

Mr. Smith, let me ask you one other

16

question.

Am I correct in understanding that under your

17

view the basis for the transferee — in this case,

18

Bayles — is limited by the fair-market value, so his

19

basis is different from the amount realized --

20

ME. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

His basis is $1.4 million.
So that what you're saying is that

22

if fair-market value puts a ceiling on it, then it puts

23

a ceiling on at both ends of the transaction? if the

24

amount of the indebtedness is the major basis, it is at

25

both ends of the transaction?

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

HR. SMITH

1

Hell, the reason for that at the

2

Bayles end of the transaction is simply because — and

3

there's case law to support this — that when the value

4

-- when the value of property is greatly — it has great

5

disparity between that and nonrecourse debt, that basis

6

ought not to be the nonrecourse, the value of the

7

nonrecourse debt because it's almost like not real debt

8

in the sense that it has — there's only a fanciful

9

aspect of that, a loan you pay, very much like a

10

contingent debt, and the courts have uniformly rejected

11

inclusions of basis in that circumstance.
QUESTION :

12

So going back to my Crane question

13

earlier, if the value of the property at the time of the

14

death of the person from whom it was inherited, had a

15

fair-market value of less than the indebtedness, that

16

would have been her basis at the time?

we agree there should be no deductible loss without

Similarly, there should be no

position been consistent on that all the way through?
MR. MANKOFF:

15

Your Honor, we raised the issue

and it was not ruled on by the Fifth Circuit.

MR. MANKOFF:

the most, the strongest handle they have to waggle at

there is no deductible loss.

5

QUESTION;

6

We agree

I would like to waggle it at you,

too, because —

7

(Laughter. )

8

QUESTION;

9

But now that they find it

-- it seems to me that if the

statute, you just read the words, the definition of

10

"amount realize!" and all the rest of it, how can it

11

have one meaning in the loss situation and a different

12

meaning when you're looking at the amount realized

13

that's claimed to be a gain?
MR. MANKOFF;

14

Because losses and deductions

15

are a matter of legislative grace.

16

17

it.

18

QUESTION;

But even if it's a matter of

20

legislative grace, and maybe you don't want it in this

21

case but the next taxpayer comes along and says, well,

22

if these words mean what the Fifth Circuit said they

23

mean in this case, we're entitled to take the loss.

24

why wouldn't that be correct?

25

MR. MANKOFF:

Because there is no economic

4

But what in the statute requires an

MR. MANKOFF;

Section 165 of the Internal

5

Revenue Code says that losses shall be allowed unless

8

range of negative economic effect.

9

the taxpayer doesn't truly suffer the loss, and he may

It's our

That is, any time

10

-- and the insurance analogy, I think, is very strong --

11

when our car is damaged, we suffer a loss, but we're not

2

allowed to deduct it because the insurance company

3

reimburses us for it.

4

But the loss has been suffered.

Just as I

5

think the government's illustration of a piece of

6

property that we own going down in value from ?1.8

7

million to $1.4 million, I think a loss has occurred.

8

think something has happened in the world that shrinks

9

the assets of the world by $400,000.

20
2

I

So I think to say

there's no loss begs the question.
To go further and say that by -- we will

22

manipulate the Internal Revenue Code to prove there's no

23

loss by increasing the amount realized on this $1.4

24

million piece of property, we therefore demonstrate

25

there's no loss.

Now, that to me is the ultimate of

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

It's

1

alchemy, because a loss really has been suffered

2

not deductible because the taxpayer has not suffered a

3

true economic detriment.

4

situations like that, taxpayers are not allowed to

5

deduct a loss even though the loss is experienced, is

suffered, is realized.

though, that the cancellation of the indebtedness is the

2

amount received for tax purposes under sections 357(c)

3

and 358?
ME. MANKOFF:

4

357(c), which has to do with the

5

contribution of assets subject to liability, does not

6

appear to have a limitation on it based upon the value

7

of assets.

8

which describes assets coming out of a corporation, does

9

have that kind of limitation.

10

As indicated in the brief, however, 311(c),

I don’t know why there's an inconsistency.

11

Generally, the code and the courts have treated

12

fair-market value and economic benefit as being real

13

concepts that must be part of our tax system, because

14

without them we don't have a touchstone with which to

MR. MANKOFF;

13

Yes.

That is absolutely

14

correct.

This is the transaction in 1970 and 1971.

15

This is the transaction to which the government has no

complaints, and their question now is -QUESTION;

17

Hell,

I know, but — I know, but

18

that’s the very amount of money that they would like to

tax on.

20

MR. MANKOFF;

The question then becomes, can

21

we rewrite section 1001(b) to correct earlier undeserved

22

deductions?

23

"amount realized" definition has never been rewritten to

24

pick up earlier errors.

25

is the cash received and property other than cash

I think the answer is clearly no.

The

It says merely, amount realized

received to the extent of its fair-market value.
That definition has never been distorted or

3

rewritten in order to recover amounts which might have

4

been distorted in previous years.

5

done in this case.

6

And it should not be

I would like to mention however briefly the

7

implication of the partnership sections because in

8

addition to 1001(b) there is another section that

9

clearly applies, carefully written by the Congress in

10

its section 752(c).

It is allegedly a rewriting or a

11

repetition of the Crane rule, and it limits itself to

12

fair-market value.

13

description or an enactment of Footnote 37.

Therefore, we believe it must be a

14

And it says that in the case of a partnership,

15

which is what was involved here, that liability shall be

16

deemed to be liabilities of the owner of property where

17

there is no recourse only to the extent of the value of

18

that property.

19

Now, the Tax Court below said that clearly the

20

language of this statute covered our situation.

21

said, however, that the legislative history suggests

22

that the 752(c) was to apply only in two situations;

23

that is, where property is contributed to a partnership

24

or withdrawn from a partnership.

25

They

We submit that that kind of result limits

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

section 752(a) and (b) so unnecessarily as to be

2

absolutely ridiculous, because there are other

3

situations in which liabilities of a partnership may

4

increase the basis of partners.

5

For example, this would mean, as was found by

6

the Tax Court subsequently in the Brontes case, that if

7

a partnership acquires an asset subject to a liability

8

in excess of its basis, that section is not within

9

752(c) because it does not involve a contribution of

10

property or the withdrawal of property.

11

the partners would get increased basis in a situation

12

like that.

13

And therefore

Now, that case was reversed subsequently on

14

the grounds that there was no true debt involved.

15

ha3 there been true debt in a situation like that, the

16

ruling of the Tax Court below would have destroyed the

17

efficacy of 752(c) in virtually all situations other

18

than the contribution and the receipt of properties.

19

But

And we think that we all want a fair and

20

consistent taxing treating system.

We don’t believe

21

that the rewriting of two sections of the code which

22

contain clear and explicit language -- that is, section

23

1001(b) and section 752(c) — so as to recover what the

24

government perceives to be improper earlier deductions

25

taken at a time when there was no risk, is a proper
