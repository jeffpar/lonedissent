ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9

11

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:
Congress has provided two general types of tax

12

relief, either or both of which may be available to certain

13

kinds of organizations.

14

First, Section 501(c) exempts the income of about

15

two dozen different types of organizations from taxation on

16

that income.

17

smaller number of 501(c) organizations including both veterans

18

groups and also groups qualifying under 501(c)-(3) to deduct

19

their contributions.

20

Second, Section 170 entitles the donors to a

^ One of the qualifications for 501(c) (3) status, and,

21

therefore, both tax exemption and also donor contribution

22

deductibility,is that no substantial part of the entity's

23

activity consists of attempts to influence legislation.

24

The proposed activities of the Appellee which has

25

unsuccessfully sought recognition as a 50r(c) (3) organization
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

will consist principally of attempts to influence legislation.

2

It attacks the constitutionality of the scheme that I just

3

described on two grounds.

4

The first is that withholding tax exempt status

5

from 501.(c> (3); or any other organizations which lobby is a viola­

6

tion of a first amendment right.

7

Congress has afforded tax exempt status to veterans organizations

8

which lobby but not to 501 (c) (3) organizations which lobby, its

9

equal protection rights have been denied.

10
11

The second is that since

The En Banc Court of Appeals unanimously held, and
we agree, that the Appellees'

first amendment argument is

12

foreclosed by this Court's unanimous holding in Cammarano

13

versus The United States that the constitution does not require

14

Congress to subsidize First Amendment activity.

15

With respect to equal protection, the Court of

16

Appeals further observed, and I am quoting, that "Taxation

17

also has a weak case solely in terms of equal protection

18

because of Congress's vast leeway under the constitution to

19

classify the recipients of its benefits and to favor some

20

groups over others."

21

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals ruled that a

22

heightened standard of equal protection scrutiny was applicable

23

and that it was infinged in this case because First Amendment

24

rights were affected even though

25

they had not been infringed.

The Court remanded to the District Court with
4

1

instruction to cure the unequal treatment which it found by

2

one of two alternatives.
QUESTION:

3

Well, did the Court of Appeals use that

4

rather obscure phrase that you just used that First Amendment

5

rights were affected but not infringed?

6

MR. LEE:

Well, it first held, Justice Fehnquist, that

7

under Cammarano they had not been violated.

8

more my characterization, but I think that is the only fair

9

way that the Court of Appeals' opinion can be read because of

10

I think that is

the effect upon First Amendment rights.

11

The Court identified as the most logical remedy

12

option to impose the lobbying restriction on veterans organiza­

13

tions none of which is a party to this litigation.

14

identified another alternative:

15

Congressional list of exempt organizations to include the

16

501(c) (3)'s which the Court observed, correctly in our view,

17

might open a Pandora's box of woes and abuse.

18

It also

judicially enlarging the

In our view, the underpinning of the Court of Appeals'

19

holding has to be that Congress has violated the equal pro­

20

tection clause even though there is no direct infringement

21

of a First Amendment right if Government treats different groups

22

of people in different ways and the

23

comes to rest on a First Amendment or other fundamental right

24

interest.

25

the equal protection guarantee into play.

deferential treatment

That is the combination of circumstances that brings

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Whatever appeal that argument might have had, if

1

2

we were at the dawning of its day in Court, I submit that

3

it comes too late because it has already been considered and

4

rejected by this Court which has held on at least three separate

5

occasions that Government subsidization of one group but not

6

another even where the fundamental rights of the nonsubsidized

7

group will be affected violates no constitutional guarantee.

8

. Buckley versus Valeo, for example, upheld provi­

9

sions of the Internal Revenue Code which granted public funds

10

to the candidates of major parties but not minor parties.

11

There was clearly unequal treatment, and there was an arguable

12

impact on First Amendment values.

13

Similarly, in Monner versus Roe and Harris versus

14

McRae congressional statutes providing medicaid funds for

15

indigent live births but prohibiting such funds for abortions

16

were attacked on the same grounds advanced here, namely, that

17

the impact of the different treatment came to rest on a

18

fundamental constitutional right of the disfavored group,

19

namely, the right to decide whether or not to have an

20

abortion.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

But the Court in those cases left open

a situation which I take it you are going to come to.
MR. LEE:

Yes, but the difference of treatment in

24

those cases was undeniable, and the effect was on a fundamental

25

constitutional right.

Nevertheless, the Court held that there
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

was a legal protection violation because there is a basic

2

difference between direct state interference with a protective

3

activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity

4

consonant with legislative policy.

5

Now

6

instant case:

7

and both of them make this case a stronger case for constitu­

8

tionality than in Harris and in Monner.

9

the difference between those cases and the
in our view there are two that are relevant,

The first difference is that in those cases the

10

two things that were treated differently were mutually pre­

11

clusive competitors.

12

event which was birth necessarily precluded the constitutionally

13

protected abortion decision by the indigent person so that to

14

whatever extent funding encourages child birth, abortion is

15

necessarily inhibited.

16
17

That is to say, the statutorily birth

Here by contrast, subsidizing veterans groups has
no automatic detrimental effect on charitable groups.

18

The second difference, and in my view the more

19

important one, is that the classification in this case is

20

part of our national acts of laws.

21

clear that for equal protection purposes, income tax cases are

22

in a class by themselves.

23

without peer in its intricacy, its detail, and its sheer

24

length.

25

classify.

This Court has made it very

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the burden of different groups in our society, the share of

2

the National tax burden borne by different groups is to be

3

either increased or decreased.

4

Congress necessarily treats different people in different ways,

5

and many of those differences have an arguable impact on a

6

fundamental right.

7

In carrying out this function,

Importing heightened scrutiny as the test governing

8

the constitutionality of that kind of a complex and inner-

9

related statutory construct would seriously damage the certainty

10

and the predictability that should be characteristic of our

11

national tax laws.

12

Aside from everything else that ought to go into a

13

fair tax system, it is important that taxpayers know with as

14

much certainty as possible what their obligations are.

15

certainty value is enhanced by the rational basis equal

16

protection has because of the likelihood that it ensures that

17

the congressional judgment will in fact survive.

18

diminished, correspondingly, by a test of heightened scrutiny.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

the judgments that Congress makes will be turned around by the

2

Courts.

3

Take this case, for example:

Section 501(c) consists

4

of 22 categories.

5

Court of Appeals found that two of those categories resulted

6

in a difference in treatment to their occupants.

7

there are differences in treatment.

8

intended differences in treatment, there would not be 22

9

categories.

10

It comes of no surprise to anyone that the

Of course,

If Congress had not

The point is that the entire Code, and not just these

11

22 categories, essentially consists of differences in treatment.

12

That, I submit, is why this Court has consistently accorded

13

great deference to Congressional line drawing in the income tax

14

area.

15

It is repeatedly stated, and most recently in

16

San Antonio versus Rodriguez, that in taxation, even more than

17

in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom

18

in classification.

19

That brings me to the final point.

That is whether

20

the distinction between lobbying by veterans groups on the

21

one hand and lobbying by 501(c) (3) organizations on the Pther

22

satisfies this deferential standard.

23

Quite clearly, it does.

Prior to 1934 there were no express statutory limita­
tions on lobbying by exempt organizations.

Congress was con­

cerned, however, in 1934 that the deductibility of contributions
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to organizations otherwise classified as religious, charitable,

2

or education could effectively translate into the public

3

financing of private propogandizing on a range of subjects

4

limited only by the donor's whim and the attractiveness of that

5

abuse increased with the donor's wealth.

6

It was a concern that was first expressed by Judge

7

Han for a unanimous Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in

8

1930 in a case called Slee versus The Commissioner, and as

9

this Court observed in Cammarano, the 1934 act made explicit

10

the conclusion derived by Judge Han in 1930 in Slee.

11

Very simply, there are differences between veterans

12

organizations on the one hand and 501(c) (3) organizations on

13

the other that are highly pertinent to this concern first

14

expressed by Judge Han in 1930 and then ratified by Congress in

15

1934.

16

In the first place, there are quantitative differences.

17

The number of veterans organizations is only a fraction of the

18

total number of the 501(c) (3) groups, and the 501(c) (3) 's

19

collect about 1500 times as much in contributions as do the

20

veterans groups.

21

structurally by virtue of the way they are chartered by

22

Congress and in fact carry out their operations do not offer

23

the opportunities for abuse identified by Judge Han in 1930

24

and by Congress in 1934.

25

Even more important, these organizations

QUESTION:

2

MR. LEE:

3

QUESTION:

Solicitor General Lee?
Yes.
What if Congress instead of giving the

4

veterans organizations a break in the tax statute had simply

5

appropriated $5 million to each of them?

6

would be challengeable in Court at all?

7

MR. LEE:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LEE:

Do you think that

I do not.
This really isn't much different.
I think it is not very much different.

10

I think this Court has made that very clear, and it brings into

11

play another body of doctrine that is also determinative in

12

this case.

13
14

QUESTION:

Has not the Congress over a period of

years granted a great many benefits to veterans?

15

MR. LEE:

Precisely.

They have been consistently

16

upheld.

17

Robison in which this Court upheld the

18

insofar as veterans' benefits were concerned to conscientious

19

objectors and to those — the benefits went to those who had

20

seen actual combat duty, and thfe challenge was by a conscientious

21

objector.

22

The most recent that I am aware of is Johnson versus
deferential treatment

The point is, as set forth in our brief, the figures

23

that have been released by the Government demonstrate that

24

two out of five of every American citizen is a beneficiary in

25

one way or another of veterans' legislation which has been passed
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

by Congress.

2

Just as is the case with the income tax laws, this

3

Court has also clarified that there is a great deal of deference

4

to which Congress is entitled in determining the benefits

5

to which those persons are entitled who have made a great

6

sacrifice for the benefit of this country, both in terms of

7

interrupting their civilian pursuits and also in terms of

8

risking their life and their health.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Solicitor General, may I go back for

10

a moment to your comment that there are only two differences

11

between the abortion cases, the funding case, and this case?

12

Do you think the abortion cases would have been

13

decided in the same way if the people on welfare who wanted

14

abortions not only didn't have them financed by the Government

15

but if they had an abortion they then lost their welfare

16

benefits?

17
18

Here, as I understand it, the 501(c) (3) organization
loses its exemption if it engages in lobbying.

19

20

QUESTION:

This is the same question that I raised

that you haven't yet answered.

21

MR. LEE:

22

I think it is not at all clear to me that Monner

23
24
25

Yes, and I plan to do so right now.

and Harris would have been decided in the same way if the
consequence had been to lose welfare benefits for a /couple of
reasons.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

One is I think another principle that comes to play

2

is whether Congress has acted in such a way as to solve the

3

problem that was immediately before it.

4

argument could be made that that was simply sweeping too

5

broadly with the revenue.

6

At least a very strong

In this instance, by contrast, the problem that

7

Congress has identified is the problem of the 501(c) (3) with

8

unidentifiable size of membership and type of membership and

9

the potential that it offers for a small number of wealthy

10

individuals to have their expression of public views, their

11

lobbying if you will, subsidized by the Government.

12

instance, Congress has not swept any more broadly than is

13

necessary to solve the particular problem.

14

QUESTION:

In this

Well, I suppose you say they are wealthy

15

persons because they are rich enough to contribute to a charity,

16

but by hypothesis, I suppose, the lobbying is for a charitable

17

purpose which the Government recognizes is in the general public

18

interest, or otherwise they wouldn't give them the tax exemption

19

in the first place.

20

MR. LEE:

Yes, and in Slee, of course, the problem

21

was attacked by defining what is meant by "charitable," and

22

what Judge Han did in that case was to uphold the Government's

23

position that it isn't really charitable if it is being used

24 |

for lobbying purposes.

25

!

Now, what this really does is to make administratively
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

more feasible to administer by eliminating the need on a case-

2

by-case basis to determine whether it is charitable, but in

3

any event, I think there is this distinction in your abortion

4

hypothetical and the case at — of course, the other distinc­

5

tion — the other two distinctions are the rules applicable to

6

veterans' cases and applicable to tax cases.

7

QUESTION:

Well, General Lee, I suppose the Appellee

8

can set up a separate corporation to do its lobbying and

9

preserve the 501(c) (3) status for everything else.

10
11

MR. LEE:

out, and that is our understanding.

12

QUESTION:,

13

MR. LEE:

14

The Court of Appeals in fact pointed that

501(c)(4).

15

Do you agree with that?
They can.

Yes, they can set up a separate

Now, they will tell you I think in fairness.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't the IRS be the first to move in

16

and say these are twin corporations, and, hence, they will lose

17

their —

18

MR. LEE:

Well, it depends on what the relationship

19

is between them, and that depends, Justice Blackmun, as you

20

correctly point out.

21

there is an attempted subsidy by the 501(c)(3) group of the

22

501(c) (4), then, yes, that is not permitted, and as a

23

consequence that is not a complete answer.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. LEE:

It is not that clear.

In the event that

It is certainly not so easy to answer.
That's right.

I have found that it is less

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

easy as the Court of Appeals applied in fact.

2

QUESTION:

General Lee,, I am not quite certain

3

what happens to an organization, a 501(c) (3) organization, which

4

does lobby.

Did you say that it actually lost its exemption?

5

MR. LEE:

6

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Is that correct?

I thought perhaps it

7

just lost its right to have contributions deductible.

8

actually loses?

9

MR. LEE:

That's right.

It

It is demonstrated by this

10

case.

11

a determination under Section 7428 that this was a 501(c) (3)

12

organization.

13

which entitles initially to income tax exemption, and then

14

Section 170 in turn keys into 501(c) (3) status in terms of

15

deductibility.

16

There was an application made for 5 01(c) (3) status for

It described 501(c) (3) status as the status

It was determined not to be a 501(c) (3) entity

17

because of its lobbying and, therefore, loses both the

18

deductibility and also the tax exemption terms.

19

QUESTION:

General Lee, one of the amicus briefs

20

argued that there was no jurisdiction under Section 7428 to

21

make a constitutional attack on the validity of tax statutes.

22

I know that in a footnote in your reply brief you indicated

23

disagreement, but it seemed that was worth a comment at least

24

because that statute seems to be set out to provide only review

25

by the Commissioner of administrative matters, not to raise
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

constitutional issues.

2

MR. LEE:

It certainly can be interpreted in that

3

way, Justice O'Connor.

4

susceptible of interpretation either way.

We submit that in that respect it is

5

The crucial language is that the Court on one of these

6

7428 reviews may make a declaration with respect to such initial

7

qualification or continuing qualification.

8
9

Now, two points:

one is that an argued qualification

is broad enough to include the constitutional issue, and the

10

second is that particularly where you have some ambiguities

11

which I think we certainly have here that it is proper to

12

look to Congress's purpose.

13

In this case, the congressional purpose was rather

14

clear.

15

of the decisions in Bob Jones versus Simon, the 1974 decision,

16

the companion case that came down the same day in Americans

17

United.

18

It was to undo the inequity that resulted as a result

The only way one of these 501(c) (3) or other types

19

of organizations could obtain a determination as to whether

20

they did or did not qualify was to either have a refund suit

21

in the District or to go into the Tax Court.

22

Now, since the objective law is to provide one simply

23

remedy for determination of 501(c) (3) status vel non, it would

24

be a bit anomalous to say that Congress intended to split those

25

out and require constitutional determination through the old and
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

more difficult process.

For that reason, we don't think that

7824 precludes the constitutional issue.

3

QUESTION:

One other question if I may.

4

that this Court's recent holding in Perry Education

5

anything to do with this case?

6

MR. LEE:

Do you think
has

Well, I think it helps us to an extent.

7

It certainly is not as on point as Cammarano, but, nevertheless,

8

it does slow the flexibility, other things being equal, insofar

9

as the judgment

of the policy-making bodies is concerned.

10

Yes, Perry does support us.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. LEE:

Flexibility for the First Amendment?
Well, the ability of that amendment to make

13

accommodation in the light of other policies, in this case

14

it enforces at least Cammarano's holding that when you have

15

an arguable effect as you do in this case on a First Amendment

16

interest

17

tion, that you judge the case as an income tax and you defer to

18

Congress's judgment in that case.

19

that comes about because of an income tax classifica­

Indeed, I know of no instance in which this Court

20

has ever applied anything other than the rational-basis test

21

in equal protection income tax cases.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. LEE:

24

QUESTION:

25

May I ask one other question?
Yes.
Forgetting for the moment the equal

protection phase of the case because I think part of your
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

position that all charitable organizations are not fungible,

2

veterans are different from —

3

MR. LEE:

4

QUESTION:

Right.
Do you think your First Amendment argument

5

is equally strong regardless of the character of the organization?

6

Say it is Aid to the Blind or something, and you are a group whici

7

just tries to promote legislation which will help the group.

8

MR. LEE:

I do, Justice Stevens.

You can argue that

9

Cammarano was distinguishable, but I think that the principle

10

that was established in that case carries through to Congress

11

can make the decision as to which kinds of First Amendment

12

activity it wants to subsidize and which kinds it does not

13

which really brings it back to an equal protection —

14

QUESTION:

But you have acknowledge, I think, that

15

there is more than subsidy at issue.

16

the portion of the income that is spent on lobbying.

17

required them to lose their entire exemption.

18

MR. LEE:

It isn't just deducting
It has

That is correct, and it is different from

19

Cammarano in that respect.

20

is that in that instance, Congress went no further than it

21

needed to go in order to cure the problem it identified.

22

The second is that whether it is —

23

QUESTION:

My answer is twofold.

The first

Here in effect, my Aid to the Blind

24

organization is losing a very valuable exemption because it

25

engages in a protected

activity.

That's all it does.

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

I assume

1

2

that the lobbying is a protected activity.
MR. LEE:

Yes, but it is just as true here as it was

3

12

Amendment that the Government was allowed to take something

away from it?

14

MR. LEE:

So far as I know, at least in that respect,

15

you will be making new law in this case, but I submit to you that

16

the principle from which that new law ought to be made has been

17

declared by Cammarano, and that is that it is after all a

matter of Congress's determining how certain activities should

19

be financed and how valuable those activities are to Congress,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN CARY SIMS, ESQ.,

5

7

That is correct for reasons set forth in

In this case, Appellee challenges the severe penalty
which is imposed on public charities if they choose to engage

10

in substantial lobbying as a means of promoting their charitable

11

purposes.

12

Let me emphasize at this point that the case only

13

involves public charities, that is, organizations under Section

14

501(c) (3) which are not private foundations.

15

tions are groups that, as defined in the Tax Reform Act of

16

1969 and the IRS Regulations implementing that statute, are

17

groups where there is not seen to be enough accountability to

18

the public to assure that the organization will act in the same

19

way that it would if it were accountable to the public.

20

Tax Reform Act of 1969 virtually precludes lobbying by private

21

foundations.

22

Private founda­

The

We think that is important because when the Solicitor

23

General was referring to what he believes Congress was concerned

24

about in putting into effect the restriction that we are

25

challening here, he is talking about the possibility that a
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

charity might really not be acting for charitable purposes

2

in particular circumstances.

3

individual would be attempting to manipulate a charity or

4

perhaps even set up a charity in order to serve private

5

concerns.

6

It may be that a particular

Well, under the Tax Reform Act of 1969 Congress has

7

already defined the group of organizations where there could

8

be a legitimate concern that there is not enough public accounta­

9

bility, and Congress has acted independently, and that issue

10
11

is not before the Court in this case.
Another point that I think is worth making with

12

regard to the risk that a public charity might lobby in order

13

to promote some private interest, we would like to point out

14

that first of all to. the extent that there is any risk in that

15

regard, lobbying isn't any different than any other activities

16

that a charity might engage in.

17

say that there is some risk that a charity might engage in

18

litigation or pamphleting or publishing of educational books

19

in order to promote some private interest, so the argument

20

made by the Solicitor General doesn't really hone in specifical­

21

ly on the lobbying issue.

22

That is, I suppose one could

As we have emphasized in our brief, there are also

23

a number of independent restrictions that aren't challenged

24

in this case that would prevent a public charity from using

25

its resources for lobbying or for any other activity on behalf

3

to be operating for the public good rather than for a private

good.

QUESTION:

Under the IRS regulations in order to

Are you suggesting, Mr. Sims, that IRS

6

could make an evaluation in each case of each exempt taxpayer

7

and say, "You are 33 and a third percent over the line here,

8

so we will cut off 33 and a third percent of your exemption"?

9

MR. SIMS:

Your Honor, if Congress were to pass

10

that alternative statute, that would deal with our argument

11

about the disproportionate penalty.

12

was a penalty on lobbying that was tied in amount to the amount

13

of excessing lobbying beyond whatever Congress said was

14

appropriate, the disproportionate aspect of the current penalty

15

would be eliminated.

To the extent that there

16

We don't believe that would make the statute

17

constitutional because you are still left with the core question

18

that comes up in any First Amendment case which is first of

19

all what is the congressional interest that is being promoted

20

by the restriction, and secondly, has Congress in developing

21

the particulars of the restriction done it in as narrow and as

22

minimally restrictive a way as possible.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Sims, you suggested a moment ago

24

that there was a distinction to be made between lobbying for

25

a private interest or in the public interest.

Is that done by

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Congress or by the IRS?
MR. SIMS:

2

That's part of Section 5 01(c) (3), Your

3

Honor, in that no group can qualify under 501(c)(3) if there

4

is going to be any inurement for the benefit of a private

5

individual.
In addition, the statute itself says that any charity

6
7

has to be organized and operated exlusively for exempt purposes.
QUESTION:

8
9

So it is the common law concept of

inuring to the private groups as opposed to the public groups.
MR. SIMS:

10

It is a common law concept that has been

11

incorporated in the statute, and that is also reflected in the

12

regulations, so to the extent that one can discuss a concern

13

about the possibility that lobbying might be directed to a

14

private end, that is already dealt with in a number of other

15

ways in the statute and in the regulations and, as you have

16

indicated, in the common law of charities and trusts.
QUESTION:

17
18

Well, the truth of the matter is if you

set a trust for your own benefit, that is not charity.

19

MR. SIMS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

and the private.
MR. SIMS:

Your Honor, the terminology that we have

3

been using in our brief and that I have been trying to use today

4

is public charity which is not a statutory term of art, but it

5

is a term that is used often to refer to charities, that is,

6

501(c) (3) groups, which are not private foundations.

7

foundations are independently defined in Section 509 of the

8

Internal Revenue Code.

Private

9

The point I was making in this regard is that to the

10

extent that it said that additional restriction on lobbying is

11

necessary in order to prevent charities from engaging in activities

12

inproperly on behalf of private interests, that concern is

13

already dealt with in other provisions in the code, specifically,

14

the no-inurement provision in Section 501(c)(3), and also the

15

operated-and-organized-exclusively-for-exempt-purposes provision

16

of the code.

MR. SIMS:

A private foundation is defined in Section

509 in terms of the sources of income, so —

3

QUESTION:

I'm talking about charity, not foundation.

4

MR. SIMS:

Well, a private foundation under Section 509

5

is a subcategory of Section 501(c) (3) charities.

6

QUESTION:

Just because you are named by an individual?

7

MR. SIMS:

No, because the sources of revenue for

8

that particular subcategory of charitable organizations comes

9

primarily from a small number of sources rather than from the

10

general public, so in enacting the Tax Reform Act of 1969,

11

Congress indicated that there wasn't the same discipline of

12

public support for those groups that there is for public

13

charities, but this case only involved public charities.

ability to exist.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Sims, do you agree with the Solicitor

4

General that a 501(c) (3) organization lobbying loses its

5

exemption?
MR. SIMS:

6

First of all, an organization is permitted

7

to lobby up to the level of substantiality under Section

8

(501(d); (3).

9

501(c)(3) and it lobbies to an excessive amount, it does lose

10

If an organization has already qualified under

its exemption altogether.

11

QUESTION:

Could it then qualify for 501(c) (4)?

12

MR. SIMS:

It could up until the Tax Reform Act of

13

1976.

14

— it created this election mechanism under Section 501(h), and

15

the statute also said that if an organization is eligible to

16

elect under Section 501(h), and all charities under 501(c) (3)

17

are eligible to elect except churches and except private

18

foundations, so any other public charity could.

19

eligible to elect under 501(h), then if you lose your 501(c) (3)

20

status because of excessive lobbying, then you can't qualify

21

for (c)(4) status.

22

One of the changes that was made in 1976 was to provide

If you are

That was a change that was made in 1976.

in fact, the exemption application which is in the record

in the case indicates that there are a number of other liti-

To the extent that the Solicitor General relies

on Slee for the proposition that lobbying is not a proper

purpose for promoting a charitable end and that somehow the

use of that means rather than some other means of promoting

22

a charitable purpose renders the purpose uncharitable, we suggest,

23

that even if Slee were properly decided, .in 1940, and that may

24

be a close question, certainly the law since then has developed

25

very strongly in the direction that lobbying is a proper means

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of promoting a charitable purpose.

2

says it.

3

in fact, the IRS regulations say that charitable, which is the

4

umbrella term which is used in the regulations, in Section

5

5 01(c) (3) is used in its generally-accepted legal sense.

6

The restatement of trust

All the standard treatises on trust state it, and

In fact, in permitting charities to lobby up to the

7

level of substantiality, Congress has implicitly recognized that

8

lobbying is a proper means of promoting a charitable purpose.

9

The Government relies very heavily on three cases.

10

Cammarano, obviously, is the bedrock for the Government's

11

position, and then there are the three more recent cases of

12

Buckley, Mayer, and Harris.

13

I'll speak briefly about Cammarano which has already

14

been discussed at some length in the exchanges between the

15

Solicitor General and the Court.

16

the penalty that is imposed on a charity which engaged in

17

substantial lobbying is totally disproportionate to the

18

amount of lobbying that is engaged in, and that makes a big

19

difference in comparing this case to Cammarano.

20

We do want to emphasize that

In Cammarano there was a complete correspondence

21

between the amount of the lobbying activity engaged in by the

taxpayer and the tax consequences.

Amendment grounds the whole lobbying qualification in 501(c) (3).

6

MR. SIMS:

We are challenging the restriction itself, and the more particular

issue before the Court is the disparity in treatment between

I understand that.

Do you think there is

11

any merit in the suggestion that the First Amendment issue is

is here.

We believe that because this is an appeal under

MR. SIMS:

We believe — I think there is something

to the Government's argument that the relief would be different,

and if it weren't a 1252 case. If it were a more conventional

5

case, I think we might have had difficulty because if we

6

prevail on the First Amendment issue, we would get relief

that would be broader than the relief we got in the Court of

8

Appeals.

QUESTION:

All right.

10

MR. SIMS:

On Cammarano, we do think that the penalty

here that there was in the Cammarano case.

13

Secondly, of course, this case does have the equal

protection issue.

15

a non-discriminatory, even-handed denial of deductibility

16

did not violate the First Amendment.

17

The specific hold in Cammarano was that

Of course, we don't have a non-discriminatory,

18

even-handed across-the-board denial of tax benefits based on

19

lobbying.

the veterans organizations — are allowed to lobby without

limitation in support of their charitable purposes, and the

22

501(c) (3) groups must choose between the tax benefits of the

23

statute and their freedom to engage in lobbying as a means of

24

promoting their charitable purposes.

25

We have a situation in which certains groups —

We have never claimed that.

In fact, we wouldn't claim that —

QUESTION:

Congress has an enormous respect for the

more favorably than others; therefore, it must fall.

14

You are saying that the veterans are being treated

MR. SIMS:

The problem is not the favorable treatment.

15

The problem is that the favorable treatment is specifically

16

directed to the area of First Amendment rights, and —

QUESTION:

I'm addressing that.

More favorable

treatment with respect to lobbying which everyone has the right

to do of course.

20

MR. SIMS:

Your Honor, we don't believe that there

21

could be more favorable treatment of that sort unless it can

22

meet the First Amendment standard of review.

23

the congressional purpose in providing the preferred treatment

24

is compelling and unless the restriction is crafted in such

25

a way that there is a minimal restriction on First Amendment

That is unless

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

rights.

2

Buckley

may be a good example in that respect.

I

3

think that nobody can question the Court's — the logic of the

4

Buckley decision when it says that there can't be a requirement

5

that anybody who wants to run for President has $20 million.

6

The Court pointed out that would encourage a multiplicity of

7

parties, frivolous candidacies, and in effect it would under­

8

mine the very purposes for the statutory benefit scheme which

9

was to change the way that elections were financed for the

10

good, not to create greater chaos.

11

In Buckley

the distinction that was made between

12

existing party, the new party, was integral to the system of

13

public financing of elections, but if there had been a statute

14

that said that the Republicans or the Democrats could get

15

funding, but the other major party can't, that would have been

16

suspect under the equal protection clause.

17

We think that is essentially what is involved here.

18

It is discrimination among charities based on their identities.

19

It is specifically directed to the exercise of First Amendment

20

rights-, and it is not directed to the legitimate objectives

21

that Congress certainly can implement if it chooses to do so

22

to, for example, provide various other sorts of benefits to

23

veterans:

24

medical benefits, and lots of others.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sims, supposing the cure to the problem

you are now addressing was to just say, "Okay, we won't let

5

that do your client?

10

MR. SIMS:

It wouldn't, Your Honor, and we don't

think that is the appropriate relief.
QUESTION:

What good would

Judge Mikfa —

It would remove the illegality

which

you are now purporting to describe.
MR. SIMS:

That's right.

It would not solve the

11

equal protection argument that we are making, but it would

12

solve the equal protection disparity.

13

As we have noted in our brief, we are not aware of

14

any situation in which this Court has found an equal protection

15

violation and then remedied by saying, "We will take something

16

away from the parties that aren't before the Court rather

17

than giving something to the party who is."

18

That in some cases involved very substantial drains

19

on the Federal Treasury.

social security case in which widows can get a certain benefit

21

and widowers can't and there is a challenge to it, and it is

22

determined that that is an equal protection violation, if

23

you are going to provide benefits to everyone, that means

24

additional money is drawn out from the Treasury.

25

For example, when you have got a

Nonetheless, this Court in those cases where an
33

equal protection violation is found has uniformly extended the

QUESTION:

3
4

So you don't defend the Court of Appeals'

result in this respect?
MR. SIMS:

5

No, and in fact no one does so far as I

6

know.

The veterans groups obviously don't prefer the remedy

7

suggested by Judge Mikfa.
QUESTION:

8
9

Then don't you have the jurisdictional

problem that you are basically arguing for relief as an

10

Appellee that was different than that granted by the Court of

11

Appeals?

12

MR. SIMS:

Yes, Your Honor, so that everything that

13

I said before with regard to the First Amendment issue would be

14

equally applicable to this except to the extent that I think

15

this Court has in the past sometimes regarded a remedy —

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Except with respect to your cross appeal.

Did you raise that in your cross appeal?
MR. SIMS:

Yes.

The two questions were the First

19

Amendment issue and the remedy issue, but I think this Court

20

in the past has sometimes reached the remedy issue in an equal

21

protection case as an integral part of the whole case without

22

necessarily granting review independently.

23

The other thing we would emphasize in that regard is

24

this case does involve First Amendment rights, and in, for

25

example, the picketing cases, I don't think it has ever been
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

seriously suggested that if there, is an equal protection violation

2

because some people can picket at a particular location and

3

other people can't that the proper solution is to prevent

4
5

everyone from picketing.
QUESTION:

But can you think of any case in which

6

this Court has granted someone a benefit under the Internal

7

Revenue Code which Congress didn't choose to grant them because

8

of an equal protection argument?

9
10
11

MR. SIMS:

I'm not aware of any tax case that does

that, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

But there is one case in this Court where

12

it says that on equal protection argument, you cannot solve it

13

by taking away from the other one, Cummins against the Board of

14

Education, 1914.

15
16
17

MR. SIMS:

I'm glad to hear about it.

(Laughter.)
MR. SIMS:

Justice Rehnquist, I am reminded that

18

although it is not a Federal tax case, the Spizer case did

19

involve a tax benefit that had been denied.

20

QUESTION:

That was a California —

21

MR. SIMS:

That's right.

23

It was a state case,

so it

is not directly on point, but it may be analogous.
QUESTION:

While we are talking about remedy,

may I

24

ask you what you would suggest is the proper — if we put to

25

one side for a moment the equal protection problem and just
35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

concentrate on the First Amendment and your argument that there

2

is a penalty here, how do you cure that?

it on the Cammarano facts where you just allow a deduction for

the amount expended, but how can you get partially qualified

5

Suppose that Congress decides that 60

both of those arguments help us.

cases still involve a situation where the Courts found that there

are two competing interests each of which was valid.

QUESTION:

But my question is on the assumption that

10

we are not troubled with — we say we agree with the Government

11

that veterans are different from Aid to the Blind because taking

12

away their exemption won't really help you, and we are just

13

concerned with your First Amendment issue on its own bottom.

14

Is there any way to remedy

15

see a defect in the scheme because it penalizes you whenever

16

you engage in substantial lobbying by taking away your entire

17

exemption?

the problem insofar as we might

Is there any rememdy that would be addressed to

that alleged defect in the scheme?
MR. SIMS:

I haven't developed a specific one.

I'm

sure it could be done.

anybody in this ligitation has put forward a specific proposal.

QUESTION: Does that sound like your position is that

I'm sure it could, but I don't think

the Government must subsidize the lobbying?

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Just to be consistent with the First

MR. SIMS:

No, our argument is that the Government —

QUESTION:

What limited relief besides that could you

4

have?

5

your objection

How could the Government, as Justice Stevens asked, meet

6

without subsidizing lobbying?

MR. SIMS:

Well, I think Justice Stevens is asking

7

whether a remedy could be developed that would prevent subsidy

8

of lobbying but still allow deductibility for other charitable

9

activities.

10

The point that I wanted to make is that we believe

11

that the question is not whether Congress has to subsidize

12

lobbying but whether Congress having chosen to allow these

13

tax benefits to charitable groups which are engaging in

14

socially beneficial activities and to allow those groups to

15

litigate and to publish books and to carry on —

So you must keep the exemption going for

The Congress, if it is going to single

out that category of First Amendment activity —
QUESTION:

So, yes, they do.

So your position is that

21

lobbying must be allowed by charitable organizations without

22

lasing the exemption.

That's your position.

23

MR. SIMS:

Yes, that is our position.

24

QUESTION:

And must to that extent be subsidized.

MR. SIMS:

Unless Congress could explain in a way

the only feasible solution, and you haven't suggested that there

is a feasible solution inbetween.

We have either got to take your exemption away

MR. SIMS:

We don't

Well, the Tax Reform Act of 1969 shows

io

that when Congress does what to specifically address an identified

ii

problem it can do it, and that's exactly what it did with regard

12

to the perceived abuses and activities by private foundations.

13

QUESTION:

But you have already conceded I thought

14

in discussion that Congress can favor some entities like the

15

veterans, the handicapped, over others.

16

MR. SIMS:

No, Your Honor.

Did I misunderstand you?
That certainly is right,

17

but I also I believe qualified that by saying that when the

18

discrimination involves the exercise of First Amendment rights,

19

Congress has to meet the very stringent requirements that are

20

applicable when First Amendment rights are regulated, that is,

21

Congress has to explain why some groups are being given enhanced

22

First Amendment rights and others aren't, and it has to show

23

that the restriction has been developed to minimally intrude

24

on the exercise of First Amendment rights.

25

QUESTION:

When the blind and the veterans engage

1

in lobbying, it is to advance a broad public interest that has

2

been recognized in other settings by Congress, is it not?

3

MR. SIMS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The blind, the lame, and

4

their representatives are the very people that are being

5

denied their right to lobby in pursuit of their charitable

6

interests, so we have an amicus brief which has been filed in

7

this case by almost two dozen charitable groups of just the

8

sort you have referred to:

Association, and the Girl

10

TV

QUESTION:

the Red Cross, the American Heart
Scouts.

They don't have a case before the Court

for us to make an evaluation of their problem, do they?

12

MR. SIMS:

No, all their activities are limited by

13

the same statute that limits Taxation's activities.

14

Taxation,

15

carrying out charitable purposes under Section 501(c) (3), and

16

they are all limited with regard to the extent that they can

17

use one particular means, lobbying, in order to accomplish their

25

Like

Like all 501(c) (3) groups, they are limited to

charitable purposes.

In the amicus brief, those charities

have indicated that that restriction prevents them from carrying
our their activities in support of the sick and the injured and
the needy, and that they could do those jobs better if they
could lobby.

In fact, they have indicated that in some cases

lobbying may be the only way to accomplish a charitable goal,
such as, for example, the Mental Health Association mentions
that in many places there are archaic statutes that are on the
40

books regarding the mentally handicapped or the mentally ill,

2

and it is only by working for a revision of those statutes at

3

accomplish their purposes.

that they can

We don't think that there is any basis for saying

6

that there is an inconsistency between lobbying and the proper

7

charitable purposes that 501(c)(3) organizations promote.
