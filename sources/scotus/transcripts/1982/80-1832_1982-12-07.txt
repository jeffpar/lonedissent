CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Next we will hear

versus Chadha.

Nr. Gressman, I think you may proceed

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE GRESSMAN, ESQ.,

6

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER, THE UNITED STATES

8

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
MR. GRESSMAN;

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
I speak again on this reargument on behalf of

11
12

the House of Representatives.

13

directly to the two critical arguments or contentions of

14

those who seek invalidation of Section 244(c)(2) of the

15

Immigration and Nationality Act.

16

are :

17

This time I proceed

Those two arguments

One, that the legislative review device in

18

that section collides with the presentment clauses of

19

Article I, Section 7.

20

use of this device violates the general separation of

21

powers doctrine.

22

The second contention is that the

These arguments must be examined in light of

23

House Resolution 926, an Act adopted in 1975 by which

24

Section 244(c)(2) has been implemented in this case.

25

That examination, I suggest, will show that these two

1

critical contentions in the context of this case are

2

illusory and misplaced, and that the faults in these

3

arguments are so pervasive as to implicate Article III

4

justiciability problems.
Now, turning to the first argument, the

5
6

presentment clause argument, one finds that that

7

argument is undermined and indeed destroyed by the

8

negative nature of House Resolution 926.
QUESTION:

9
10

Where do we find the text of that

resolution, Mr. Gressman?
MR. GRESSMAN:

11

The resolution is incorporated,

12

I think, at page 59A of the appendix to the Government's

13

jurisdictional statement.

14

House of Representatives does not” -- "does not approve

15

the granting of permanent residence in the United States

16

to certain named aliens," including Mr. Chadha.

17

the total text of House Resolution 926.

It reads in whole:

"That the

That is

Now, on its face as well as in its legal

18
19

effect it contains a number of significant negative

20

propositions.

21

negative:

Let me count the ways in which it is

One, it does not order the deportation of Mr.

22

23

Chadha.

Mr. Chadha came into this Section 244

24

proceeding conceding that he is deportable because he

25

had earlier violated the statute which -- by overstaying

his student visa by which he entered this country, and

2

under the statute that overstaying of a visa renders him

3

deportable.

4

this case.

That is not an issue and never has been in

Two, House Resolution 926 does not alter Mr.

5
6

Chadha’s legal status quo,

which is one of

7

deportability. It has no effect on it.

8

Three, it does not adjust Mr. Chadha’s status

9

to that of a permanent resident alien, which is what he

10

requested.
Three — or four,

11

this resolution does not

12

alter or affect any of Mr. Chadha's personal or

13

individual rights.

14

alien, a deportable alien who applies for this kind of

15

relief comes to that proceeding with no rights.

16

-- as we pointed out last argument, this is essentially

17

a plea for mercy, a plea for grace on the part of the

18

alien who seeks to get his status changed by

19

dispensation.
QUESTION:

20

It is long established that an

It is a

Is it not true that had the

21

resolution not passed all four of the consequences

22

you 've described would have taken place?
MR. GRESSMAN:

23

That is true, but that is not

24

this case.

This is a negative.

This is a legislative

25

no to all of these consequences that might well ensue.

If either

1

That would be a different case, Your Honor

2

house had disapproved this application, then certain

3

things would have ensued.

4

presumably, some Kind of alteration in the legal status

5

quo .

Then we would have had,

6

But the critical point here is that by saying

7

no, none of those consequences occurred and there is no

8

change in the legal status quo.

9

there is certainly no kind of enactment of positive law

10
11

To put it differently,

which results from the House action saying no.
Now, it is significant, I think, that the

12

opponents of this legislative review device, as well as

13

the court below, have been unable to identify any kind

14

of positive law change that occurred as a result of the

15

adoption of House Resolution 926, and that a

16

determination of a positive law change, an

17

identification of it is absolutely essential to the

18

presentment clause argument.

19

utterly failed to demonstrate that there is any positive

20

law change here.

21

And I think they have

You simply cannot change a legislative no into

22

a legislative yes.

Now, this goes straight to what

23

Justice White was speaking about in his opinion in

25

HR. GRESSMAN:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That’s right.

— whether Congress is in session

or not.
MR. GRESSMAN:

That’s right.

This no is the

15

equivalent of non-legislation, and it cannot bring into

operation the presentment clauses.

19

QUESTION:

What is the consequence of 926 on

the action of the Service and of the Attorney General?
MR. GRESSMAN:

Well, the statute provides, not

20

House Resolution, but the statute provides that upon the

21

disapproval by one house the Attorney General is

22

directed by statute to execute the lawful order of

23

deportation.

You mean he had no rights in the

MR. GRESSMAN:

QUESTION:

MR. GRESSMAN:

That would have resulted in a

change of status, would it not?
MR. GRESSMAN:

change of status only if both --' neither house

QUESTION:

Well, there's no action presented

So it depends on whether the

QUESTION:

That is the critical

Of course.

— as to what the character of it

is?
MR. GRESSMAN;

That is true.

That’s true with

20

any bill that's proposed over there.

21

that’s the end of it as far as legislative change of

22

legal status quo is concerned.

23

If it fails,

Now, the other critical point I want to

24

mention is that House Resolution 926 has three

25

characteristics which reflect a unique sovereign power

1

vested exclusively in the Congress and therefore there

2

can be and is no violation of the separation of powers

3

doctrine.
First, this Court has repeatedly held, and as

4
5

recently as three weeks ago in Landon against Placencia,

6

that the power to admit or exclude aliens is a sovereign

7

prerogative that implicates many of our problems with

8

foreign countries and involves consideration of our

9

political and economic circumstances at the time.

And

10

virtually all of that sovereign power is vested in the

11

Congress, and Congress has in effect created a kind of a

12

public right or a public privilege here which it can

13

dispense in accordance with what it sees most

14

desirable.
The second point is that House Resolution 926

15
16

is essentially a negative answer to a political

17

question.

18

1893, this Court has repeatedly said that the exercise

19

of this power over aliens, this sovereign power,

20

involves answering political questions, in the best

21

sense of that term.

22

referred to the purely political nature of the

23

legislative power over aliens.

question
Finally, House Resolution 926 is saying no

2
3

within the traditional area of legislative discretion,

4

discretion that is built into 244(c)(2), and is inherent

5

discretion in a legislative body to say no.
So we suggest that a combination of these

6
7

circumstances will, an understanding of what these

8

arguments entail, suggests that both the presentment

9

clause argument and the separation of powers doctrine

10

simply do not apply under the circumstances of this

11

particular case and this particular statute.
QUESTIONj

Let me ask. you a question, without

15

that is again a kind of a public right, which Congress

QUESTION;

12

MR. GRESSMAN:

function, that kind of a trial to the courts, then it

becomes involved with the whole inherent judicial power

15

over cases or controversies.
QUESTION;

16

Justice O'Connor, in response to your

denounced that effort as totally unpreceden ted and a

violation of all cardinal constitutional pr incipies, and

remains our conviction that this is not an appropriate

2

case in which to decide the merits of legislative

3

review.
However, it is also the view of the Senate

4
5

that it will serve the public interest to obtain, in an

6

appropriate case or cases, the judgment of this Court on

7

the constitutionality of legislative review procedures.

8

To that end, the Senate yesterday docketed in this Court

9

an appeal from the en banc judgment of the District of

10

Columbia Circuit in the Federal Trade Commission case.
The statute in that case authorizes the

11
12

Congress to disapprove trade regulation rules of the

3

Federal Trade Commission by concurrent resolutions of

4

the Congress.

5

Congress in the Federal Trade Commission Improvements

Act of 1980 established a special procedure to obtain

7

judicial review and the judgment of this Court on its

con stitutionality.

That statute is severable and the

We are therefore asking in that case that the

9

Court reach the merits and decide the constitutional

21

questions presented.
QUESTIONS

22

You're adhering to your position

23

here in this particular case that the statute is not

24

severable?

25

MR. DAVIDSONs

That is correct, and because it

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

is not severable there is no relief which may be

2

provided to the Petitioner and the issue should be taken

3

up in a case in which effective judicial relief under

4

Article III may be provided.
In determining whether to ask the Court to

5
6

resolve the disagreement between its coordinate branches

7

over legislative review, Petitioner has weighed

8

NR. DAVIDSON:

The executive precedes it.

This is an arrangement which changes the order of

The

10

legal status of a deportable alien may not be changed

11

unless the executive initiates the request to the

12

Congress and unless the two houses, through the mode of

13

acquiescence or, in the case of criminal aliens, through

a positive resolution of approval, concur.

MR. LEE;

12

that do not require some exercise of a judicial type

What Congress cannot do, what the Constitution

12

forbids it from doing, is to delegate to one house of

13

Congress the power to make those changes in the law and

14

to perform those functions regarding aliens.

15

Wow, Congress tries to avoid this argument and

16

by avoiding the argument of the requirements of Article

17

I by saying that we don't have action by Congress here

18

and that all that happened was that the Attorney General

19

had made a recommendation to Congress and that

20

recommendation failed passage in the House of

21

Representatives, and therefore like so many other

22

recommendations that fail it does not implicate the

23

requirements of Article I, Section 7, of the

them, were disapproved by House Resolution 926.

This is

Viewed alone, that might be seen simply as

12

doesn't account for the fact that 334 other aliens who

13

were sent up in the same general time frame as Mr .

14

Chadha became three days later than the Hou se Resolution

15

926 was passed entitled to have their statu s adjusted,

16

simply because of the passage of time and t he fact that

no resolution of disapproval had been intro duced in

either house for them.

So that we have a situation in wh ich 334

Senate and the House, by the passage of tim e and

QUESTION:

2

Would you say that that silence

equated to non-legislation?
MR. MORRISON:

3

Well, I have trouble with the

4

non-legislation versus legislation.

It seems to me that

5

what silence means is much more clearly in terms of it

6

defining what the action meant.

7

action was adverse action to Mr. Chadha and five others

8

and it wasn't simply the failure of recommendation,

9

because silence under our Constitution, Article I,

That is, that the

10

Section 7, does not enable a law to be passed.

Laws are

11

passed by two houses of Congress with the concurrence of

12

the President or a two-thirds vote overriding his veto,

13

and that is not what happened with respect to any of the

14

334 aliens.
Therefore, I conclude that the description as

15
16

mere failure of approval of Mr. Chadha and five others

17

is wholly inaccurate, as it would be inaccurate and

18

unconstitutional to say that the other 334 could have

19

successfully had their status changed simply by the

20

passage of time.
In fact,

21

of course in this case the reason

22

that Mr. Chadha's status was adjusted was because of the

23

veto, and this veto is not something that's authorized

24

by the Constitution.

vetoes over aliens, although they did provide for two

2

one-house vetoes in the Constitution itself, both of

3

them by the Senate, over the power of the President to

4

make treaties and the President's powers of

5

appointment.

6

They're contained in the Constitution, and their absence

7

here makes it more compelling that the Court should not

8

imply that Congress is authorized through one house to

9

veto actions of the executive.

10

^hose are explicit one-house vetoes.

It is for this reason that we contend that the

11

action by the House of Representatives here is

12

unauthorized under the Constitution and hence is not

13

proper within the meaning of the necessary and proper

14

clause so heavily relied upon by the House and Senate.

15

In defining the scope of the term "proper" in the

16

necessary and proper clause, this Court in Karbury

17

versus Kadison required that the legislation be both

18

necessary and proper and, in terms of propriety, that it

19

meet both the letter and spirit of the Constitution.

20

Not only does this veto run contrary to the

21

specific requirements of the Constitution, but it also

22

violates its spirit.

23

a legislative shortcut, and because of the legislative

24

shortcut it eliminates the role of the President and the

other house.

This point about the need for deliberative

8

that is that although the activities here are portrayed

as an interbranch struggle, this case illustrates that

10

the lives of individuals are very much at stake in

14

That is, that the

The framers were concerned with the avoidance

act in a precipitous manner.

And it is these

2

institutional checks against unwarranted and unwise

3

action, as much as the formal requirements of the

4

Constitution, that the veto transgresses.
This case is a perfect example of it.

5

The

Attorney General, after carefully considering the facts

of this case, the statutes, the precedents, concluded in

a formal proceeding that Nr. Chadha was entitled to an

adjustment of status and to remain in this country.
QUESTION:

Attorney General's power that was delegated to him, Mr.

Morrison ?

Finally, to the extent that you could view

what was in the minds of even Congressman Eilberg, let

MR. DAVIDSON;

To reiterate a point of the

is very much a question of separation of powers also.

18

The entire history of this effort to reach

accommodations between the two branches from the 1930's
