ORAL ARGUMENT OF SILAS J. WASSERSTROM, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. WASSERSTROM:

8
9

We mill hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
In September 1975 the Petitioner uias arrested

10
11

when he tried to steal a coat from a department store.

12

Six months later he mas brought to trial on a charge of

13

attempted petty larceny.

14

to that offense or bean convicted of it after trial, he

15

could have received a maximum sentence of one year in

16

jail.

17

in September of 1976.

18

a free man.

Had the Petitioner pled guilty

He mould have been released, at the very latest,
He mould now long since have been

But Petitioner did not plead guilty and mas

19

20

not convicted.

21

claiming that because he mas mentally ill at the time he

22

tried to steal the coat he should not be blamed for his

23

act.

24
25

Instead, he raised an insanity defense,

The Government did not contest this claim and
the trial court found, after a stipulated trial, that

3

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the Petitioner tuas not guilty by reason of insanity.

2

the basis of this acquittal and on this basis alone, the

3

Petitioner was ordered committed indefinitely to a

4

mental hospital.

5

he could prove that he was not mentally ill and

6

dangerous.

7

On

That is, he was ordered confined until

The Petitioner still remains confined in the

8

hospital on the basis of that commitment, even though

9

more than seven years have now passed six his initial

10

incarceration and more than six years have passed since

11

the time ha would have necessarily been released had he

12

bean convicted rather than acquitted.

13

will remain committed in the hospital for the rest of

14

his life.

Conceivably, he

Petitioner contends that whatever the validity

15
16

of his initial commitment to the hospital, once he has

17

been confined there for longer than he could have been

18

incarcerated upon conviction, his commitment became an

19

indefinite one.

20

constitutionally required to prove the need for his

21

commitment by clear and convincing evidence, something

22

which the Government has yet to do with respect to Mr.

23

Jones.

24
25

Thus, the Government was

If it cannot do so now, Petitioner submits, he
is entitled to release.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Wasserstrom, you're not

2

challenging» as I understand it» the initial

3

commitment.

4

positio'n correctly, that you raise is mhether he must be

5

released at the time that the sentence period mould have

6

expired under the criminal statute, is that right?

7

The only question» if I understand your

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Our position is, Your Honor,

8

that he has to be released at that time unless the

9

Government can at that time prove his commitability by

10
11

the standards required.
QUESTION:

And you are not challenging, then,

12

the standard or burden of proof at the time of his

13

commitment ?

14

MR. WASSERSTROM:

15

question is not raised in this case.

16

justifications for that initial commitment, and me dont

17

discuss one may or another mhether those justifications

18

are sufficient to validate that initial commitment and

19

me don't think the Court need reach that question.

20

Whatever reasons there are that might have justified his

21

initial commitment, those reasons mould have justified

22

only a commitment that could have lasted, mithout the

23

Government meeting a burden of proof, for as long as he

24

could have been incarcerated upon conviction.

25

QUESTION:

It's our position that
There are arguable

If his initial commitment is not

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-0300

1

punitive, then how is the statutory period of time that

2

he could serve on the criminal charge relevant?

3

MR. WASSERSTROMS

Well, use think the only

4

justifications that could, the only justifications that

5

could countenance that initial commitment are punitive

6

in nature, that is, are a kind of punitive rationale.

7

QUESTION:

And so for us to agree usith your

8

position uie usould have to conclude that his initial

9

commitment uses punitive?

10

MR. WASSERSTRQMi

Your Honor, I don't think

11

that it's terribly important uihether the usord "punitive”

12

is used,

13

which would justify the initial commitment are what I

14

would call backward looking justifications,

15

justifications that do turn on the fact that he was

16

found to have committed a criminal act beyond a

17

reasonable doubt.

18

punitive or not doesn't seem to me is important, or the

19

label that we attach to them it doesn't seem to me is

20

important.

but I do think that any kinds of justifications

And whether they're treated as purely

The point is,

21

that is,

though, those rationales all do

22

turn on the nature of his act, and his act is one which,

23

we submit,

24
25

justifies confinement only for a year.
QUESTION:

3ut hasn't this Court,

as well as

the United States Court of Appeals in the O.C. Circuit,

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

said there's no rational connection between the possible

2

sentence and the possible length of stay after an

3

acquittal, not guilty by reason of insanity?

4

MR. WASSERSTROM?

I believe that the law in

5

the United States Court of Appeals in 3rou»n against the

6

United States and in Wade v. Jacobs» in both of those

7

cases the Court suggested that there is a relationship

8

between the sentence that might have been imposed and

9

the length that the commitment can persist without the

10

Government proving commitability under civil commitment

11

standards.

12

that question, and I think this is the first case that

13

raises it.

14

I don't think that this Court has addressed

QUESTION:

Oh, the Court has said expressly

15

that there's no connection, in one case some time ago.

16

Well, excuse me.

17

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, it is true in Lynch v.

18

Overholser this Court suggested certain rationales for a

19

commitment, but it didn't then go on to say whether

20

those rationales were ones which would justify an

21

indefinite commitment or simply one that would persist

22

as long as the sentence might have been imposed.

23

And it's our view that those rationales,

24

whether you call them punitive or not, are all ones

25

which evaporate once the insanity acquittee has been

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

confined for as long as he could have been confined if

2

he had been convicted.

3

QUESTION:

Does your position depend at all on

4

whether or not the initial crime was a crime of

5

violence?

6

example?

7

Suppose this had been a street mugging» for

MR. WASSERSTRQMJ

Well» of course» the more

8

serious the crime» the longer the maximum sentence that

9

could have been imposed and the more distant the rights

10

that we're talking about» the more distant in time the

11

rights we're talking about would become available.

12
13
14

QUESTION;

Is a maximum sentence the standard

or the actual sentence?
MR. WASSERSTRQM;

Well* of course» there never

15

is an actual sentence.

16

that likely would have been imposed?

You mean the actual sentence

17

QUESTION:

Right.

18

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well* all we'r9 arguing for

19

here is that at the time* once he's been incarcerated as

20

long as the maximum sentence that could have been

21

imposed is up --

22

QUESTION:

Doesn't the statute say he should

23

be there until he's "eligible for release"?

24

what the statute actually says?

25

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Isn't that

That is what the statute

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

says , Your Honor

2

QUESTION;

3

MR. WASSERSTROM:

4

It's clear that that's what

the statute says.

5

6

But isn't that clear?

QUESTION:

That doesn't say he automatically

gets out in one year.

7

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, we're not arguing that

8

he should automatically get out after one year.

9

we're arguing is that after one year the state should

10

have to prove the need for his continued confinement.

11

We're asking this Court to in effect read into the

12

statute or strike down the statute to the extent that it

13

authorizes —

14
15

QUESTION:
didn't he?

Well, I mean,

All

he asked for this,

Didn't he plead guilty by insanity?

16

MR. WASSERSTROM:

17

QUESTION:

He pled insanity.

Well, so then he says — I don't

18

understand what the one year has to do with it.

19

agreed to the sentence, that he should be there until he

20

could be released --

21

22

MR. WASSERSTROM:

it would be our

position —

23

QUESTION;

24

MR.

25

Your Honor,

He

— in very broad terms.

WASSERSTROM:

Well,

it would be our

position that by raising the insanity defense he

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

shouldn't be held to have agreed to anything.

2

insanity defense is a defense which is available to him

3

under the District of Columbia law.

4

QUESTION:

The

Well» the law says — the law

5

doesn't say any time that he shall be given this

6

examination» is that right?

7

MR. WASSERSTRQM:

The law — that's correct.

8

3ut it's our view that the statute» to the extent that

9

it doesn't provide this protection —

10

11
12

QUESTION;

Well» when do you say he must have

a hearing?
MR. WASSERSTROM:

We say that he must have a

13

hearing after he's been confined for as long as he could

14

have been upon conviction» not because the statute

15

suggests that, but because we think the Constitution

16

requires it.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

So you say he should have had a

hearing four years ago.
MR. WASSERSTROM:

That's right, he should have

20

had one then, and he asked for one then.

21

soon as he had been incarcerated -- confined, rather,

22

for a year, he asked for a hearing.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

I know that.

He went, as

But your position is

that's when ha should have had it?
MR. WASSERSTROM:

That's when he should have

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-9300

1

had it.

Howevar, the relief we're asking for now is

2

simply that he be given one at this point* or released.

3

QUESTION;

Isn't your major point* perhaps* or

4

a main point the matter of inhere the burden of proof

5

lies at the time of that hearing?

6

MR. WASSERSTROM:

That's right* and for that

7

we rely on this Court's decision in Addington against

8

Texas.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Of course, that was a civil case,

wasn't it?
MR. WASSERSTROM;

Addington was a civil

12

commitment.

13

is no way to distinguish Addington from this case once

14

the insanity acquittee has been incarcerated —

15

confined, rather — for a year.

16

However* it seems to Petitioner that there

QUESTION;

Addington was a case where the

17

person was being committed and it was suggested that he

18

was insane for the first time.

19

one who raised the insanity and persuaded the court that

20

he was insane.

21

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Here your client was the

Your Honor, Mr. Addington

22

had been committed seven times in the eight years

23

preceding his commitment.

24
25

QUESTION;

Well* but that didn't enter into

the Court's assessment, I don't think.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

MR. WASSERSTROM

It's part of the facts in

2

Addington.

3

this Court in its statement of the facts» he had been

4

committed seven times.

5

He had been committed» and it's mentioned by

QUESTION:

Well» do you think a different

6

burden of proof uiould attach if he mas being committed

7

for the first time?

8

derived from Addington?

9

Do you think that can be fairly

MR. WASSERSTROM:

No.

But I think that, in

10

viern of the fact that Addington had in fact been

11

committed all these other times, that this Court did not

12

consider that to be relevant to its determination.
QUESTION:

13

Well, I thought the case mentioned

14

one of the interests is not being stigmatized.

15

client brought the stigma on himself by pleading

16

insanity.

17

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Your

Well, first of all, Your

18

Honor, it seems to me that the rationale of Addington is

19

primarily based on the liberty at stake there and this

20

Court's determination that inhere there mas the kind of

21

massive curtailment of liberty that's involved in an

22

indefinite commitment to a mental hospital, one that can

23

last for a person's life, that the risk of error uiith

24

respect to that determination should be borne

25

disproportionately by the state.

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 828-0300

1

2

It's true that the Court mentions the fact
that there is the additional stigma attached.

3

QUESTION;

It says there are two interests,

4

one the one you've just described and one the stigma.

5

didn't realize it had treated them as disparate

6

interests.

7

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, I think the liberty

8

interest far overshadotus the stigma interest.

9

me say this —

10
11

QUESTION;

I

But let

Do you think that Addington says

that in so many words?
MR. WASSERSTROM;

12

It doesn't say it in so many

13

words, Your Honor, but I think that it is clear from the

14

opinion.

15

Let me say also, though, that it seems to me

16

there is an added stigma when a defendant who prevails

17

on an insanity defense is than ordered committed to a

18

hospital.

19

stigma, and as this Court said in Vitek against Jones,

20

the hospitalization itself also may involve such things

21

as behavior modification and forced treatment in a way

22

that even a prison may not involve.

The hospitalization itself may involve a

23

And so the actual hospitalization, whether you

24

call it a stigma or not, is certainly an oppressive sort

25

of condition.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

QUESTION

Well* he invites that by pleading

insanity.

3

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, the question is

4

whether he invites it beyond what the Constitution

5

permits.

6

should be held not guilty for an act some time in the

7

past because at that time in the past* at the time he

8

committed this single act* he was mentally ill and not

9

responsible for his acts.

10

We'd agree that he is making a claim that he

That's all that he's claiming.

He's not also

11

asking that he should be committed to a hospital because

12

ha's notu mentally ill and dangerous.

13

QUESTION:

No, but society can certainly take

14

into account his behavior in the criminal trial and what

15

he has asserted there in determining what should happen

16

to him thereafter.
MR. WASSERSTROM:

17

Well, to begin with, there's

18

no question that society can take that into account in a

19

civil commitment proceeding.

20

introduce in the civil commitment proceeding the

21

evidence of his criminal activities.

22

introduce into evidence the fact that he had himself

23

claimed that he was mentally ill at some time in the

24

past.

25

things would be admissible.

Obviously, they could

They could

Under ordinary evidence rules those kinds of

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

The question is whether they could take it

1
2

into account in such a uiay as to» simply because he

3

raises an insanity defense, put him in a hospital in a

4

situation where he may stay there for the rest of his

5

life unless he can prove that he's no longer mentally

6

ill or dangerous.

7

provides that is not a reason to hold that the statute

8

is constitutional.

9
10

QUESTION:

And simply because the statute

Mr. Wasserstrom, he had the initial

50-day release hearing, did he?
MR. WASSERSTROM:

11

Yes,

Your Honor.

And I

12

think there may be some confusion about the 50-day

13

hearing.

14

hearing for people who are found not guilty by reason of

15

insanity, ana it's an automatic hearing and it is held

16

50 days after the return of the verdict of not guilty by

17

reason of insanity.

18
19
20

It's true that the statute does provide a

3ut that hearing is a hearing at which the
Government bears no burden whatsoever.
QUESTION:

In any event, I gather at the

21

conclusion of that that his confinement to St.

22

Elizabeth's was continued?

23

MR. WASSERSTROM:

That was because,

we submit,

24

the statute says that unless he proves that it shouldn't

25

be continued,

it is continued.

That's all the 50-day

QUESTION:

And was the second hearing six

months later or some time longer after?

4

MR. WASSERSTROM:

5

didn't really have a second hearing.

confined for over a year, a legal challenge was raised

7

to his continued confinement.

8

QUESTION:

10

he never had -- well, he

MR. WASSERSTROM:

His attorney did, in his

behalf.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Yes.
And there was no evidence

15

held at that -- no evidence was taken at that time.

16

was purely a legal question of whether, since he had

17

bean confined for over a year, the Government should be

18

forced to prove the need for his continued confinement

19

by clear and convincing evidence.

20

ruled against him.

QUESTION;

QUESTION:

At the 50-day hearing, there mas

3

evidence taken, wasn't there?

4

MR. WASSERSTRCM:

At the 50-day hearing there

5

was evidence taken from a psychologist, although the

statute requires that it be a psychiatrist.

only witness that was put on at that hearing.

Who presented

it?

10

Who presented it?

QUESTION;

So the Government assumec at least

the burden of going forward with the evidence?

13

MR. WASSERSTRCM:

Although the statute didn't

14

require it to do so, it appears that the Government did

15

assume that burden.

evidence?

QUESTION:

13

What should nave happened at the

MR. WASSERSTROM:

11
12

And there's just no way, it seems to me, to

That's right, they shouldn't

ha ve .
Let me suggest something else, Your Honor.

It

14

seems to me that to some extent that hearing may have

15

progressed the way it did because the prevailing law in

16

the District of Columbia at that time appeared clearly

17

to be that the Petitioner was going to be entitled to

18

his release after a year if the Government couldn't meet

19

civil commitment standards.

20

Brown against United States and Waite v.

21

Jacobs, two cases from the U.S. Court of Appeals, had

22

said that once the insanity acquittee is committed, is

23

confined for as long as he could have been upon

24

conviction, then the burden shifts to the Government to

25

prove the need for his commitment.

That was the law in

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

the District of Columbia, to the extent there was any

2

law, at the time of this hearing.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Which hearing?
The 50-day hearing,

the

5

50-day hearing, which came eight months after the

6

Defendant was arrested.

7

So you see, at that time the worst it appeared

8

that Mr. Jones' situation would be was that within three

9

or four months he would be entitled to that hearing

10

where the Government had the burden of proof anyway.

11

And so it seems to me that to read into what actually

12

happened at that hearing what the Government would have

13

this Court read into it is grossly unfair to Mr. Jones

14

and to Mr. Jonas' lawyer.

15

That lawyer thought that no matter what

16

haopened at that hearing after a year his client would

17

be entitled to a full civil commitment proceeding.

18

as a matter of fact, at that time it was a civil

19

commitment proceeding at which the burden of proof would

20

have been on the Government to prove commitability

21

beyond a reasonable doubt.

22

QUESTION:

Well,

And

there was one stage in this

23

proceeding, as I understand it, when the Court of

24

Appeals agreed that he was entitled to a civil

25

commitment proceeding.

MR. WASSERSTRQMJ

That's right.

The Court of

2

Appeals panel first ruled against the Petitioner and

3

then reversed itself.

4

interestingly enough, the Government did not proceed

5

with civil commitment proceedings.

When it reversed itself»

6

QUESTION;

7

taken six years to get here?

8

9

Is there any reason this has all

MR. WASSERSTROM;

Well, the Court of Appeals

each time they decided the case took a year, year and a

10

half, and it decided it three different times.

11

Petitioner's, not his trial counsel, not his counsel at

12

the 50-day hearing, but a counsel from the Public

13

Defender's Office, brought a petition for his release

14

right after he had served, been confined in the

15

hospital, for one year.

16

QUESTION:

3ut the

Is there anything in the record to

17

suggest why no evidence was offered on his behalf?

18

that a tactical move to sharpen the issue?

19

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Was

Your Honor, no, I think

20

that's very unlikely.

21

— frankly, I don't know the lawyer that represented him

22

at the 3C-day hearing.

23

Public Defender Service.

24
25

The lawyer that represented him

He's not a lawyer from the

Whether he didn't present evidence simply
because he thought he had none to offer or whether he

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

just didn't take the trouble that maybe he should have

2

taken in trying to accumulate evidence, or again,

3

perhaps he simply was relying on the fact that after a

4

year under the prevailing law as it appeared to be at

5

that time his client was going to be entitled to relief

6

anyway.

7

his incarceration, eight months after his arrest and he

8

had been confined from that day forth.

9

And this hearing occurred eight months after

So the lawyer may simply have felt that at

10

this hearing it doesn't really matter much what happens;

11

three months from now the Government's going to have to

12

prove this person is commitable beyond a reasonable

13

doubt.

14

QUESTION:

Also, probably the average person

15

doesn't have psychiatrists waiting around to testify for

16

them, isn't that true?

17

MR. WASSERSTRQM:

Well, that, Your Honor,

18

raises what I think is a very interesting point, which

19

is not in any of the briefs.

20
21

QUESTION:

I mean, is there any organization

of psychiatrists like legal aid?

22

MR. WASSERSTRQM:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. WASSERSTRQM:

25

I was looking at the —

No, there isn't.

Psychiatrists aid or something?
No.

And interestingly

enough, when I was looking at the statutes involved

here , it turns out

2

QUESTION!

3

MR. WASSERSTROM!

4

Well*

there is in Massachusetts.
I thought you meant in O.C.

There may be in other places.

5

But in the statute» inhere people are civilly

6

committed in the District of Columbia there is provision

7

made for the appointment of a psychiatrist to help him

8

at a release hearing, and he's paid if the committee is

9

indigent.

There are no comparable provisions with

10

respect to insanity acquittees.

11

acquittee is not supplied with a psychiatrist if he

12

can't afford to hire one, and it's not even clear he's

13

entitled to one should.he be able to afford it.

14

QUESTION;

So the insanity

Let me just ask one question about

15

ycur legal theory.

16

process clause or the equal protection clause?

17

Are you primarily relying on the due

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Your Honor,

as we said in

18

our reply brief, I think we concede that if our due

19

process argument fails,

20

that the Petitioner here is sufficiently different from

21

the committee in Addington that these procedures that

22

are accorded to him or that are not accorded to him meet

23

due process standards, then it's likely that the Court

24

would uphold the difference, would on the same theory

25

uphold an equal protection claim, but not necessarily.

that is if this Court thinks

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

The fact is that in the District of Columbia

2

civil committees are afforded protections that go oeyond

3

those u/hich are constitutionally required» and we still

4

would argue —

5

QUESTION:

The thing that troubles me about

6

your due process argument» supposing u/e have precisely

the same facts, say in Texas, and say in Texas they had

8

a maximum sentence of ten years for this offense.

9

take it under your theory there would be no due process

13

15

I

claim.
MR. WASSERSTROM:

He would have a due process

claim once the ten years were up.
QUESTION:

But otherwise — different process

is required depending on the length of the sentence.
MR. WASSERSTROM:

This is because -- this is

16

because the legislature in Texas would have said that

17

this kind of conduct merits a possible sentence of up to

18

ten years, and because the rationales for committing

19

people found not guilty by reason of insanity of that

20

conduct are, if there's a justification for commitment

21

at all, ones that look to the nature of the conduct.

22

QUESTION:

But it seems to me if your case

23

turns on a comparison between his treatment and the

24

treatment of a person who is convicted of the offense,

25

you're really in the final analysis relying on the equal

24

protection clause
MR. WASSERSTROMJ

2
3

Well, I think the tuio in a

case like this are almost coterminous.

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. WASSERSTROMI

Suppose it were a life sentence?
Then — again, we're not

6

conceding that a commitment based purely on a not guilty

7

by reason of insanity is ever justifiable.

8

Court, I submit, needn't reach the question in this

9

case.

10
11

But this

This was not an offense that carried anywhere

near life.
QUESTION;

Well, unless the rationale you

12

propose inevitably would at least be relevant to the

13

claim, on the very moment that he is acquitted that he

14

may not be committed without having a hearing in which

15

the Government takes the burden of proof.

16

MR. WASSERSTROM;

Your Honor, it's the

17

Government, not us, that take the position that this

18

commitment after not guilty by reason of insanity is

19

just like a civil commitment.

20

according to the Government in its brief, is to commit

21

people who are mentally ill and dangerous.

Its sole purpose,

22

We concede that there may be other purposes

23

for an automatic commitment following a not guilty by

24

reason of insanity.

25

QUESTION;

If we agree with you, the next

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

challenge will surely be the next day after the

2

acquittal.

3

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Then this Court will have to

4

decide whether those other rationales which we are not

5

challenging will justify a commitment» automatic

6

commitment following not guilty by reason of insanity.

7

8

QUESTION:

But agreeing with you has a lot to

do with deciding about those other rationales.

9

MR. WASSERSTROM:

I don't think they do» Your

10

Honor.

11

commitment is justified» it's not one that can justify a

12

confinement that lasts longer than the maximum

13

sentence.

14

The point is» on whatever rationale the

QUESTION:

3ecause after all, the acquittal

15

was based on the fact that at the time of the crime the

16

person was insane.

17

MR. WASSERSTROM:

18

QUESTION:

19

20

That's true.

Not at the time that he was tried

or at the time he's acquitted.
MR. WASSERSTROM:

And that's why if the only

21

rationale for the commitment is a conclusion that he's

22

presently mentally ill and dangerous, it seems to me it

23

can't survive.

24

for example, did mention other possible rationales, and

25

it's clear that Congress when they enacted this statute

3ut this Court in Lynch v. Overholser,

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

11

All we're asking is that it not be

QUESTION;

3ut you're also asking — are you

not also asking that the Government must maintain the
burden of proof at all times?
MR. WASSERSTROM:

All we're arguing here is

12

that it must meet the Addington standard of proof once

13

the Petitioner has been confined for as long as he could

14

have been confined if he had been convicted.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

In other words* you'd like to have

us import the civil standard into the criminal law?
MR. WASSERSTROM:

Well, again* Your Honor,

18

it's because the rationales which support his initial

19

commitment are ones which simply do not justify a

20

commitment of an indefinite duration.

21

which would justify, arguably* a commitment to the

22

maximum term that he could have been subjected to.

23

QUESTION;

They're ones

Mr. Wasserstrom, if you rely on a

24

comparison to the criminal proceeding to judge the

25

adeauacy of the insanity procedures* would it be

constitutional to do away with the 5G-day hearing that

2

you now have and substitute a hearing at the time when

3

the man first becomes eligible for parole?

4

MR. WASSERSTROM:

I would see no problem with

5

that at all.

6

provided here for is any kind of due process

7

whatsoever.
We suggest at the end of our brief that the

8
9

I don't think the 50-day hearing as

Government has several alternatives.

After a person is

10

found not guilty by reason of insanity* they could right

11

then and there initiate civil commitment proceedings,

12

and if they can show in a way that satisfies those

13

standards that he is commitable he then can be

14

indefinitely committed.

15

maximum sentence is uo, at which time then they have to

16

meet a standard of proof.
QUESTION;

17

Or they can wait until his

No, but I'm just thinking that the

18

other side of the coin is, would it be permissible to

19

govern the scheduling of potential release hearings by a

20

schedule that just paralleled what would be appropriate

21

if the man had not been found not guilty by reason of

22

insanity?

23

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Again, Your Honor, this

24

Court would have to first answer th9 question whether

25

those other rationales for an automatic commitment are

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

justifiable ones.

2

not.

3

rationales» to the extent that they exist» are ones

4

which are geared to the offense which the person was

5

found not guilty by reason of insanity of.

6

therefore» once he's been confined for as long as he

7

could have been upon conviction» he's entitled to

8

release unless the Government can then prove by clear

9

and convincing evidence that he is commitable.

They're not raised by this case» but those

have left.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA I. SCHWARTZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
MR. SCHWARTZ!

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court;
This case presents to the Court for review

19

under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment a

20

key portion of the coordinated scheme enacted by the

21

United States Congress to govern in the District of

22

Columbia two critical problems;

23

whether persons who claim that because of reason of

24

mental illness they should be excused from criminal

25

responsibility should in fact be so excused.

One is the question of

The second

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-0300

1

is the question whether it is sufficient that persons

2

who successfully raise that criminal defense may be

3

treated like other persons who are candidates for civil

4

commitment.

5

The question, in other words, is whether it

6

was proper for Congress to recognize, as it did, that

7

special procedures are warranted for the treatment of

8

criminal acquittaes to protect society's public

9

interests in preventing the injuries that may be caused

10

by those individuals who have been excused from criminal

11

responsibility by reason of criminal at the time of a

12

crime.
These are issues that every jurisdiction

13
14

confronts.

15

system.

16

answer them the same way, and in fast, as the briefs

17

indicate, there is considerably flux in this area.

18

do deem it very significant that the majority of the

19

states have chosen to enact special procedures for the

20

handling of criminal acquittees.

21

They're fundamental to our criminal justice

We do not submit that every jurisdiction must

We

But even if that ware not so, in confronting

22

this case we think the Court should not lose sight of

23

the fundamental fact that Congress or any state

24

legislature entering into this sphere must confront two

25

conflicting imperatives.

Cne is to convict only those

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

persons who may justly be held criminally responsible.

2

At the same time, a state legislature or Congress must

3

provide adequate safeguards to society.

4

The two procedures rest» one on the other.

5

It's not tolerable to have an insanity defense unless

6

some mechanism for providing a tolerable degree of

7

safety to society is available to ensure another means

8

of protecting society from those persons uiho do remain

9

dangerously mentally ill.

10

The scheme that the Court is confronted mith

11

today is actually the product of several revisions.

12

tuuo occasions»

13

reacted to decisions in two cases of the D.C. Court of

14

Appeals and in one case a decision of this Court.

15

Congress has attempted» made what u/e think is a

16

constitutionally acceptable effort to fine-tuning this

17

statute to meat various constitutional and statutory

18

concerns.

19

On

in 1 955 and then again in 1970 * Congress

And

The first amendment that's of relevance here

20

by may of background occurred in 1955.

Congress

21

responded to the decision of the United States Court of

22

Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Durham against the

23

United States.

24

expand the insanity defense, adopting the rule that

25

every individual who can show — every individual whose

In Durham, the D.C. Circuit acted to

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

crime is the product of mental illness or mental disease

2

or defect at the time of the crime is to be excused from

3

that responsibility.

4

Congress was concerned that the effect of the

5

Durham decision» abandoning the M'Naughten rule which

6

had theretofore prevailed, was to make the insanity

7

defense much more widely available.

8

concerned that some mechanism should be provided to

9

assure that insanity acquittees did not simply fall

Congress was

10

through the cracks and that they be appropriately

11

considered for civil commitment.

12

The next thing that's of relevance here is

13

this Court's 1962 decision in Lynch against Overholser.

14

In that case the Court was confronted with a

15

constitutional challenge quite similar to the one

16

presented today.

17

the statute at issue here, which simply provided for an

18

automatic indefinite commitment, was unconstitutional

19

because it did not provide for any follow-up hearing to

20

determine the present mental illness or dangerousness of

21

the acauittee.

22

It was argued that the 1955 version of

It was especially contended that that

23

procedure was unconstitutional because under Davis

24

against the United States this Court had prescribed the

25

rule for the federal courts that an insanity defense

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

1

might be sustained simply because the Government had

2

failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the

3

defendant was sane at the time of the crime.

4

The Court ultimately found it unnecessary,

5

however, to ansuier the constitutional questions

6

presented.

7

written did not apply to persons such as Lynch, uiho had

8

not affirmatively availed themselves of the insanity

9

defense.

10

The Court concluded that the statute as then

The court in that case had imposed the

insanity defense upon him.

11

Nevertheless, Mr. Justice Harlan in his

12

opinion for the Court noted that whatever problems of

13

rationality might infect such a statutory scheme, which

14

is, as I say, significantly different from the oresent

15

one, might well not exist when the statute is applied to

16

persons such as the present Petitioner, who have

17

affirmatively availed themselves of the insanity

18

defense.

19

The issues which this Court was not required

20

to answer in Lynch against Overholser were answered by

21

the D.C. Circuit in 3olton against Harris.

22

Court answered the constitutional questions by

23

engrafting onto the statute the requirement that a

24

second hearing be held similar to the 50-day hearing now

25

required by statute, at which time the issues for the

There the

1

court would ba the present mental illness and

2

dangerousness of the acquitted defendant.

3

Circuit required that that hearing conform generally to

4

the requirements of civil commitments.

5

And the D.C.

In 1970» Congress enacted the reform statute

6

for the District of Columbia courts» and among the

7

problems it addressed were those it perceived arising

8

from the decisions in Lynch and Solton against Harris.

9

The court codified this Court's — excuse me.

The

10

Congress codified this Court's decision in Lynch,

11

makiong it clear that this procedure which u/e are

12

discussing today does not have any application to an

13

individual who does not wish to raise the insanity

14

defense but who is nonetheless adjudicated to be

15

insane.

Congress also undertook to repair the

17

constitutional defect recognized by the D.C. Circuit in

18

Bolton against Harris.

19

open to it which it as a legislature had available,

20

which were not available to the D.C. Circuit.

problems that the D.C. Circuit had recognized were the

23

actual insanity.

commented upon the gap, the possibility that the mental

status of the acquittee had changed in the interval

By the way, so far as we're auiare there's

nothing in the statute which specifies in any way what

QUESTION:

3ut "temporary” here in this case

is six years.

10

MR. SCHWARTZ;

No.

No, Mr. Justice Marshall.

11

The Government disagrees with the Petitioner's

12

contention that his present confinement rests upon that

13

temporary commitment or upon his acquittal.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I am all ears.

I am all ears.

The Government's contention is

16

that the reason that Mr. Jones is today committed are

17

twofold:

One, a hearing was held at the conclusion of

18

50 days.

At that hearing the only proof that was

19

presented was the Government's proof, by Dr. Gertrude

20

Cooper, a psychologist from St. Elizabeth's Hospital.

21

She testified that Mr. Jones remained mentally ill, that

22

he remained dangerous to himself and to others.

23

testified that he suffered from auditory hallucinations,

24

that he heard voices that other people did not hear,

25

that his thinking was infected with delusional ideas,

She

1

and that» notwithstanding the fact that ha was receiving

2

9C0 milligrams of Thorazine daily» a very high dose

3

according to all the testimony, he nonetheless continued

4

to have these hallucinations.

5

QUESTION;

6

Mr. Schwartz, who had the burden at

that hearing?

7

MR. SCHWARTZ;

The statute on its face does

8

prescribe that the burden is upon the acquittee.

9

burden of proof obviously must be subdivided into its

That

10

two components, the risk of nonpar suasion and the burden

11

of going forward.
In this case it is perfectly clear, we submit,

12
13

that the Government bore the burden of going forward.
QUESTION;

14

Yet, according to the transcript of

15

that hearing, Mr. Kraekoff — the attorney for the

16

Government, wasn't he?

17

MR. SCHWARTZ;

18

QUESTION;

19

Yes.

— began by stating that the burden

is on the Defendant.
MR. SCHWARTZ;

20

That's right.

In fact, it's

21

fair to say that transcript reveals a certain amount of

22

confusion.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Well, I certainly would say so, in

view of that comment.
MR. SCHWARTZ;

He also said that this is a

440 FIRST ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 028-9300

1

Bolton hearing, and 3olton of course teaches that the

2

burden of proof is on the Government.

3

if I may, I'd like to deal uiith the risk of

4

nonpersuasion and the burden of going forward one at a

5

time.

6

But let's let —

Certainly the burden of going forward was in

7

fact borne by the Government.

8

Assistant United States Attorney, on the page you're

9

referring to, as I recall, said that he thought the

10

burden was upon the Defendant, but nevertheless the

11

Government was prepared to proceed, and he asked whether

12

that would suit the pleasure of the court and of the

13

Petitioner's counsel.

14

no witnesses and all agreed that the Government should

15

put on its evidence, and it did so.

16

Mr. Kraekoff, the

In fact, Petitioner's counsel had

Furthermore, that evidence was uncontradicted

17

and was not challenged in any way by the

18

cross-examination.

19

possible to read the transcript as embodying a

20

concession by Petitioner's counsel that the facts were

21

as the Government's witness claimed they were.

22

Indeed, we suggest that it's

In any event, what is critical, we think, to

23

the Court's decision is that this case does not present

24

any issue about whether the burden of going forward with

25

the evidence may be placed upon the acquittee, because

40

advised by St. Elizabeth's Hospital and the U.S.

of the doctors from St. Elizabeth's Hospital uiho have

10

And furthermore» we are

That is, the Government

There are times when the Government does not

11

particularly agree with that testimony.

12

the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia

13

in United States versus Ecker refers to the peculiar

14

situation and the fact that this hearing is not always

strictly adversary because the Government, as counsel

16

for St. Elizabeth's Hospital, does not in fact in its

capacity as prosecutor agree with that testimony.

record reveals that happened in this case and it's our

24

understan ding that that is the norm.

25

It is open to the

The other issue is the burden, the risk of

1

nonpersuasion.

2

in this case is the ultimate conclusion of the Superior

3

Court in this case.

4

I'd like to read them if I may, that Petitioner "is

5

mentally ill and as a result of his mental illness at

6

this time he constitutes a danger to himself or

7

others."

8
9

We would submit that the relevant datum

The court entered its findings» and

We'd suggest that, particularly in light of
the absence of any contrary argument by Petitioner's

10

counsel, it is perfectly reasonable to infer that the

11

court concluded that, wherever the law might place the

12

risk of nonpersuasion, the Government had successfully

13

shouldered it.

QUESTION:

14
15

And therefore we -Well, on that basis the case

shouldn't be here at all, I suppose.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

16

Your Honor, that may be

17

correct.

I suppose it's fair to point out that we had

18

not read this transcript at the time we filed our brief

19

in opposition and these facts were not called to the

20

Court's attention.

21

Wasserstrom who took the initiative of submitting this

22

transcript to the Court with a copy to us.

In fact, it was my brother Mr.

23

It may well be that this case does not present

24

all of the questions or some in the focus that the Court

25

believed that they were in when it granted the

That's obviously not for us to say.
In any event, it is our contention that,

3

although these issues are not presented as we see it on

4

this record, it is of course our contention that the

5

statute assigning the risk of nonpersuasion, as well as

6

adopting a burden of the preponderance of the evidence

7

as the standard of proof, is in any event

8

constitutional.

9

QUESTION;

Mr. Schwartz, by way of background

10

information, if you will, under the present statutory

11

scheme is it still possible for an automatic commitment

12

to be made of a defendant who doesn't himself raise the

13

plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, but who is

14

acquitted on those grounds, as occurred in the

15

Overholser case?

MR. SCHWARTZ;

clear that that is not possible.

distinguishing Addington.

10

The only question

And it's to those arguments

that I'd like to turn more directly now.
QUESTION:

11

May I ask one question before you

12

do.

13

50-day hearing in this case» it was equivalent to a

14

hearing at which the Government sustained the burden of

15

proof by clear and convincing evidence and therefore is

16

tantamount to a civil commitment?

17

arguing that?

18

Do I understand» one of your positions is that the

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Are you in effect

We are arguing that in this

19

case that was a commitment hearing and that the

20

Government did bear the risk of nonpersuasion as well.

21

However» we would argue» should the Court view the facts

22

in a different manner» that that nevertheless was a

23

commitment hearing and not a release hearing, because

24

the statute prescribes that the hearing must be held,

25

that the court must make findings, determine the issues

43

440 FIRST ST.. N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001 (202) 628-9300

and making findings and conclusions uthich are reviemable

2

upon appeal, and that in effect — and that the only «ay

3

commitment can be continued without a determination of

4

the issue of present mental illness and dangerousness is

5

if the defendant waives that hearing.

6

So it's not possible for the commitment to

7

just go on of its own force unless the defendant

8

exercises his right to waive it.

9

that, even if it were not true, if in another case or if

So that we contend

10

in this case this was not — the Government didn't bear

11

the burden of proof, it still is a commitment hearing,

12

which simply cannot be ignored as Petitioner would have

13

the Court do, as though it had never happened.
QUESTION:

14

I'm still not entirely clear on

15

what your view of the legal significance of that having

16

been tantamount to a civil commitment hearing would be.

17

Are you saying that his subsequent history has been the

18

same as if he had been civilly committed?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

20

things, but we are among other things saying that,

21

certainly.

Well, I'm not sure I would

One thing that is clear is

10

that the D.C. Court of Appeals said that the Petitioner

is not in this case.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

21

MR. WASSERSTROM:

Yes, Your Honor.

I'd like

to make two points, if I might.
First, with respect to the hearing that was

22

held after 50 days, we would submit that, although the

23

Government did call the only witness who testified, that

24

witness in fact presented no evidence whatsoever as to

25

the Petitioner's dangerousness.

Her only testimony was

our contention is that

evidence.

16

clear that that means qualitatively meaningful evidence,

17

and I don't think there's any question,

rule that due process did require that evidence be shown

17
