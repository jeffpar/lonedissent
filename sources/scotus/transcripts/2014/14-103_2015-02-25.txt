CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Streett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON STREETT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. STREETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
At the end of a bankruptcy case, a

11

professional must file a detailed fee application.

12

Numerous interested parties may object and the court

13

must hold a hearing to resolve those objections and make

14

an independent assessment of reasonable compensation.

15

Each of those steps is indispensable to

16

accurately determining the professional's core fees and

17

the estate's administrative expenses, allowing the

18

trustee to close the case and ultimately pay the

19

estate's creditors.

20

Everyone agrees that preparing the

21

application is compensable as reflected by Section

22

330(a)(6)'s guidance for determining the amount of that

23

compensation.

24

objections is an inseparable part of that same

25

code­mandated process.

Defending the application against

There is no principle basis and

3
Alderson Reporting Company

certainly no textual basis for categorically banning

2

compensation for that next step.

3

To the contrary ­­

4

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the principle basis,

5

as I understand it, is that when you prepare it,

6

you're ­­ you're serving the ­­ the trustee.

7

serving his needs but when, you know, if he's disallowing

8

it, you're, to the contrary, acting against the trustee's

9

interest.

10

You're

Isn't that a principle distinction?

MR. STREETT:

It would certainly not be in

11

the vast majority of cases.

12

Chapter 7 case the trustee hires a professional, the

13

trustee wishes to pay the professional fully for his

14

good work, and the debtor comes in and objects.

15

By defending that application against the

16

debtor's objections, the professional is serving the

17

trustee.

18

debtor ­­

For example, in the typical

The same thing happened here where the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

as much money as it can to give to the creditors.

9

MR. STREETT:

Well, in this case, for

10

example, the estate paid all of Baker Botts's core fees

11

and wanted to pay all those fees, and you had ASARCO

12

coming in as the reorganized company and objecting.

13

again, I don't think that is true in the vast ­­ in

14

many, many cases.

15

the Chapter 7 case.

16

Bankruptcy Trustees point out as amicus, a trustee is

17

not going to be able to retain competent and skilled

18

counsel if the debtor is going to be able to dilute that.

19

So,

And typically it's not the case in

So that's the on/off switch for

trustee has hired their lawyer?

11

MR. STREETT:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
Approved their lawyer?

13

But if the trustee hasn't, then they have to assume the

14

costs of fighting ­­

MR. STREETT:

No, your Honor, that's not our

16

position for two reasons.

17

ways to get compensated under 330(a).

18

(a)(1)(a), which is compensation for services rendered

19

by a professional hired by the estate.

20

(a)(1)(b) which is expenses, and that's things like

21

experts, outside contractors that the estate

22

professionals hires to help him or her do the services.

23

So in the context of an accountant who hired

24

a law firm to prepare and defend its fee application ­­

25

it happens all the time; accountants can't do it

First of all, there's two

Now, of course, ASARCO's position would

categorically ban all compensation for law firms, even

5

those retained by the trustee that defend their fee

application; it would categorically ban compensation by

7

the accountants.

8
9

And the problem with ASARCO's position is

So the fact

20

that ASARCO came in is really irrelevant to the ­­ to

this case.

22

MR. STREETT:

I don't think it's irrelevant

23

because it shows the error of the Fifth Circuit's way in

24

adopting a categorical rule that prohibits compensation,

25

even when the trustee wants to pay the professional the

particular point.

That's the only reason I really made that

3

And that's the only argument that's before

4

this Court, is a categorical ban under the statute on

5

compensating the professional for defending his fee

6

application regardless of who objects.

7

And I think this Court has already rejected

8

the distinction that Justice Scalia suggested between

9

preparing and defending the fee application.

In its

10

opinion in Jean, where the Court said there's, quote, no

11

textual or logical argument for treating so differently

12

a party's preparation of a fee application and its

13

ensuing efforts to support that application.

14

And the Court ­­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16
17

That was in the context

of a fee splitting statute though.
MR. STREETT:

That's correct.

And the fee

18

shifting context is the proper analogy here.

19

we don't claim 330(a) is formally a fee shifting

20

statute.

21

that the code requires us to do as part of our work.

22

Of course

We're seeking payment from the estate for work

But the fee shifting analogy is accurate for

a couple reasons.

6

the professional's fees for his core work will be

7

diluted by the professional being forced to defend those

8

core fees.

And as in the fee­shifting regime, the

So all of this leads to, in both the

9

And, in fact, those concerns are heightened

10

much more in the bankruptcy context for a few reasons,

11

because in bankruptcy, the fee application is far more

12

detailed and gives far more opportunity to ­­ to pick

13

and ­­ and object and a far greater range of objectors

14

are available, the U.S. trustee, the court itself, the

15

creditors, the creditors committees.

16

come in and object that do not exist in the fee­shifting

17

context.

18

All of those can

And Congress recognized this concern in

19

Section 330(a)(3)(f) by codifying the factor that

20

bankruptcy professionals be compensated at parity with

21

non­bankruptcy professionals.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but just ­­ on

23

the parity point, if you're not doing bankruptcy work

24

and you send the client a bill and they don't pay it, if

25

you've got to take litigation action or whatever, you

don't get paid ­­ you don't get those fees back.

2

follow the normal American rule and you pay your own

3

fees and if you win, good; if not, you don't.

4

MR. STREETT:

That's right.

We

And that would,

5

of course, also be true of preparing the bill or the

6

invoice which is compensable under bankruptcy.

7

Congress departed from that regime and, again, it gets

8

back to the two reasons the fee­shifting cases are

9

analogous because, outside of bankruptcy, a professional

So

10

doesn't have to go to the court to have his fees

11

approved.

12

of bankruptcy, the professional doesn't submit his

13

application to ­­ to a gallery of potential objectors,

14

and that's why bankruptcy is structurally different.

15

And that's why Congress recognized in Section

16

330(a)(4)(A)(ii) that services necessary to case

17

administration do fall within the bankruptcy court's

18

discretion to compensate.

It's a structural parity difference.

Outside

19

And when you read Section 330(a)(6)'s

20

reflection that preparing the fee application is

21

compensable, it's clearly not authorizing compensation

22

for preparing it,

23

authorized under Section 330(a)(1)(A) as a service

24

rendered, and it's most naturally falls within

MR. STREETT:

12

So you can't draw any negative inference

13

from the fact that it's mentioned for the purpose of

limiting it, that defending a fee application would not

MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
We agree with Petitioners that when a

11

bankruptcy professional is seeking compensation under

12

Section 330(a) successfully defends its fee application,

13

the bankruptcy court may increase the amount of the

14

award to compensate for the time it reasonably spent on

15

the fee defense.

16

somewhat different reason.

But we reach that result for a

17

In our view, preparing and defending a fee

18

application are not themselves services rendered for a

19

client within the meaning of Section 330(a)(1)(A).

20

they are not independent grounds for compensation.

21

And

Instead, compensation for the successful

22

defense of a fee application may be appropriate because

23

it ensures that the professional receives the

24

statutorily prescribed reasonable compensation for the

25

services it rendered in the underlying bankruptcy case.

MR. FLETCHER:

Justice Breyer, we don't

4

think it's viewed as being subject to the (4)(A) at all.

5

(4)(A) ­­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

If it's not subject to

(4)(A) at all ­­ I mean, (4)(A) forbids certain ­­ it

8

says you can't ­­ cannot allow compensation for, and

9

then, you know, it has the list there.

So ­­ so how do

10

you ­­ where do you find the authority to give this to

11

them?

12

MR. FLETCHER:

Justice Breyer, (4) ­­

13

(4)(A), which appears on page 3(a) of the record of

14

appendix, it describes the limits on compensation for

15

services.

16

defending your own fee application, that does not fall

17

within the category of services at all.

18
19

Our view is that when you are preparing and

JUSTICE BREYER:

So where ­­ where is the

authorization to give it then?

20

MR. FLETCHER:

In the authorization in

21

Section 330(a)(1)(A) that says you can allow reasonable

22

compensation for the underlying service that the

23

bankruptcy professional has rendered in the bankruptcy

24

case.

25

So here, for example, Baker Botts prosecuted

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where does it say that you

can get the money that's necessary for you to get the ­­

8

the money you pay to get the reasonable compensation.

9

Where does it say you get that?

10
11
12

MR. FLETCHER:

There's no explicit

provision.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Well, then, I

13

mean, suppose that you had to go through enormous

14

trouble to get what they paid you.

15

you ­­ you know, some kind of Voltavian bonds or

16

something ­­ you know, you

17

circumstances where it costs a lot of money to get the

18

money they paid you, and I just wonder where does it say

19

you can do that.

20

MR. FLETCHER:

They paid you and

imagine all kinds of

Well, Justice Breyer, what I

21

think is different about this is that the things that

22

you have to do to get paid when you're a bankruptcy

23

professional that we're here concerned with here are

24

things that are creatures of the bankruptcy system

25

itself and 330(a) itself.

Section 330(a) says if you're

20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

a professional and you want to get paid reasonable

2

compensation, you have to submit a very detailed fee

3

application.

4

application meets the statutory requirements, we're

5

going to open it to scrutiny by the judge, by the U.S.

6

Trustee, and by the parties in interest, and allow them

7

to raise objections.

8
9

And then in order to ensure that that

And all of that ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why isn't that in the

administration?

10

MR. FLETCHER:

11

MR. STREETT:

I'm sorry, Justice Sotomayor.
Well, he claims that it could

12

be on either a service, or a benefit, or a need in the

13

administration of the estate.

14

MR. FLETCHER:

So our view is that the

15

problem with it is that sort of Section 330(a)(1)(A) is

16

the sort of starting point, and it says reasonable

17

compensation for actual necessary services rendered.

18

And then (a)(4) limits which services are compensable.

19

It says in order to be compensable, you either have to

20

be necessary to the administration of the case or for

21

the benefit of the debtor.

22

We don't think that preparing and defending

23

your own fee application is a service rendered at all.

24

And so we don't think it's subject to the (a)(4) limits.

MR. FLETCHER:

I was just going to say,

Sounds like a policy

You're basically saying it's not in the

MR. FLETCHER:

Well, we ­­ we do think it

makes a good sense, the rule that we're advocating, but

we also think it's grounded in the statute and in the

But the Section 330(a)

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY OLDHAM

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13

MR. OLDHAM:

14

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15

Section 330(a) of the bankruptcy code

16

compensates all types of professionals for their

17

services rendered for the estate under Section 327(a).

18

But when adversarial fee litigation arises and a

19

professional either hires a lawyer or just happens to be

20

a lawyer and engages in purely self­interested fee

21

litigation work at the expense of the estate, that is

22

not a service rendered on behalf of the estate within

23

the meaning of Section 330(a).

24

in the statute that authorizes estate funds for a

25

professional to engage in self­interested litigation,

There is simply nothing

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

particularly in light of the American Rule, which

2

requires, and for 200 years plus, has required that

3

Congress speak clearly when it wants to reallocate the

4

costs of litigation.

5

And I'd like to ­­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

into this?

8

MR. OLDHAM:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10
11

So how does the fee fit

I'm sorry?
The ­­ the fee, the

fee ­­ the fee preparation fee.
MR. OLDHAM:

And I want to go straight to

12

that question.

13

also put their finger on exactly the fundamental

14

distinction between preparing a fee application and

15

litigating over a fee application.

16

an accountant, for example, goes and

17

does accounting services and then provides an itemized

18

bill to explain to the ­­ to their client why they are

19

charging what they're charging, that is a benefit to the

20

trustee.

21

benefit, but certainly the itemized ­­ itemization in

22

that bill is a benefit to the trustee and to the estate.

23

And at that point, they're still on the same team.

Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy

And it's that when
hires­­ excuse me,

The ­­ the "please remit to" line may not be a

24

But when an accountant then gets into a fee

25

dispute and has to go hire his or her own lawyer and is

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

in litigation against the estate, they're not on the

2

same team anymore.

3

point in time, the accountant is serving the estate.

4

And I think that fundamental difference matters

5

textually under Section 330(a), and it's very

6

significant under the American Rule because ­­

7

There is no sense in which, at that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Oldham, why aren't

8

they all tied together so you recognize that the

9

application for the fee is compensable?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Correct.
It's like the opening

13

application, and then the response to the objection is

14

the ­­ the defense of it.

15

all one package, that it ­­ the application, and there's

16

an answer to the application, and then there's a reply.

17
18
19

Then the objection is the answer to the

It seems to me it's ­­ it's

It ­­ why don't those three things go
together?
MR. OLDHAM:

Well, I don't think they go

20

together because Congress didn't put them together.

21

What Congress authorized under Section 330(a)(1),

22

especially when read together with Section 327(a), is

23

that professionals are entitled to compensation when

24

they're working for the estate.

25

But when ­­ when professionals have hired

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

their own lawyers or happen to be lawyers and are

2

litigating adverse to the estate, that is not ­­ they're

3

not on the same team anymore.

4

and 327(a), Congress has just simply not allowed

5

compensation for that, which is the same as it would be

6

outside of bankruptcy.

And so under 330(a)(1)

7

And all we're asking for in this case is the

8

same rule that generally applies outside of bankruptcy.

9

Because outside of bankruptcy the American Rule controls

10

and says that if you get into a fee litigation dispute

11

with your client, then you pay your own way.

12

same rule should apply in bankruptcy.

13

And so the

And I want to address why Congress might

14

have authorized compensation for preparation services

15

inside the bankruptcy context when that also is not

16

compensable outside of the bankruptcy context.

17

is because certainly in 1994, when Congress enacted

18

Section (a)(6), there's a vast difference in the amount

19

of time and the amount of effort that goes into putting

20

together a fee application in bankruptcy and putting

21

together a bill for the client.

22

And that

Now, certainly, it's ­­ as time has gone on,

23

clients require more and more detail in bills and

24

that ­­ that difference might be diminished.

25

is ­­ because in bankruptcy a fee application is

32
Alderson Reporting Company

But there

Official

1

required to be filed, it made perfect sense for Congress

2

to come in in (a)(6) and say you get compensated for

3

that.

4

But what's not different between bankruptcy

5

practice and outside of bankruptcy practice is fee

6

litigation.

7

Rule applies and says inside or outside of bankruptcy,

8

you pay your own way.

9

say anything different about that in Section A ­­ in

10
11

When fee litigation arises, the American

And so Congress did not need to

Section (A)(i).
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Do lawyers these

12

days actually charge private clients for fee

13

preparation?

14

MR. OLDHAM:

No.

Well, there might be some

15

extent to which overhead accounts for things like that,

16

but certainly, no lawyer is going to put on a bill, you

17

know, time spent preparing this bill, but the fact that

18

they're not charging for it doesn't mean that it's not a

19

benefit to the client because, again, when the ­­ I

20

think most clients, when they get a bill and see that

21

they have to pay, say, $100,000, it's a pretty good

22

benefit to them to know why they have to pay $100,000,

23

and to be able to object if they feel that there's, you

24

know, an objection warranted to that bill for $100,000.

25

out of practice for half a century, but my ­­ my ­­ my

wrong about that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Maybe I'm

Well, again, I ­­
We can ­­ we can check it

out.
MR. OLDHAM:

I think the only sense in which

lawyers do that is to the extent that ­­ that it's built

10

into overhead.

11

practice, otherwise, of lawyers marking down their time

12

for it, and I think that would probably be a shock to

13

most clients to hear that you ­­

14
15

But I don't think that generally, as a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You ought to

think ­­ might want to think about it.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is ­­ is there any writing

18

that says that when lawyers, outside bankruptcy,

19

determine their ­­ their fee structures, that they

20

include reimbursement for the risk that they might have

21

to go into court to defend it?

22

MR. OLDHAM:

I've never heard that.

Well ­­ and we ­­ we cite the

23

Gibbons­Grable case in our brief, but there's ­­ there's

24

a number of things that go into, you know, rate setting

25

for law firms and one of them certainly is a risk of

34
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

nonpayment.

Another one is a risk of collections.

If you ­­ if you have a particular client

3

where you're afraid of collections, you might also

4

have ­­ want a retainer and things like that.

5

yeah, rates account for a variety of things like risk of

6

nonpayment and risk of collection.

7

goes to an important point about bankruptcy practice,

8

which is that bankruptcy lawyers use non­bankruptcy

9

market rates.

But,

And I think that

And so, to the extent that they are using

10

a non­bankruptcy market rate, they're already getting

11

some ­­ you know, some amount in their rates that

12

accounts for the risk of dilution.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

On that theory, if ­­ I

14

mean, if ­­ if you're supposed to get some fees ­­ say,

15

$100,000 ­­ and in that fee is ­­ is various risks of

16

the extra money it'll cost to collect or the extra risk

17

of you won't get it, you'll only get half and ­­ and

18

you ­­ you set the rate at 100,000.

19

And so now a different risk is eventuated ­­

20

namely, you had to go to litigation ­­ and that wasn't

21

in the 100,000.

22

everything, why shouldn't it be?

Well, then, if it's reasonable and

23

I mean, why is ­­ you're ­­ you're trying

24

to, in that 100,000, give the employer something for

25

their ­­ for their time and their effort and also

35

compensate certain risks.

in the

MR. OLDHAM:

But how would you
I think that's

That's right, Your Honor.

And

6

I think the American Rule draws the line, because if ­­

7

if it were the case that anytime a damages award or

8

anytime a fee award had to be defended, therefore, we

9

need to give them more, the American Rule wouldn't

10
11

exist.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, no, of course, it

12

doesn't exist ­­ you're quite right ­­ outside of

13

bankruptcy.

14

But now you're saying that the 100,000 does

15

include all kinds of ­­ for various payments for things

16

that might make it more expensive to get the money.

17

then what I don't see is saying some and not others.

18

MR. OLDHAM:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

Well, I think ­­
And this is just one of

them, I mean, the ­­ that you have to go into court and

21

litigate, is just one of them.

You wouldn't object, for

it looks to non­market ­­

7

Can you tell me, if ­­ if a distinguished

MR. OLDHAM:

That's correct.

I mean,

Congress, you know, wanted parity in Section ­­ in ­­ in

10

Section 330(a).

11

what Congress effected in 1978 was to make clear that

12

bankruptcy lawyers can get the same market rates that

13

they would get outside of bankruptcy.

And so, generally speaking, what ­­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In the papers ­­
Mr. Oldham, you ­­ you

16

agree, don't you, that in this system, the court can do

17

enhancements?

18

Yes.

MR. OLDHAM:

Yeah, that's correct.

Well,

19

that ­­ that's not been ­­ certainly disputed in this

20

case.

21

Yes, that's ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

So some of the things

22

that we've said are permissible for enhancements are

23

exceptional delays in payment, extraordinary outlays of

24

expenses, and unusually protracted litigation ­­ okay?

25

­­ that those count as enhancements.

38
Alderson Reporting Company

We said that in

Official

1

Perdue v. Kenny A.

2

Why isn't this just like that?

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, there's ­­ I guess

3

there's two responses to that.

4

looking at enhancements and the ­­ the question when

5

that was litigated below is not whether enhancements

6

could be authorized, but instead, what the proper test

7

was for enhancements in the bankruptcy context.

8
9
10

One is that when you're

Here, the whole question is under
Section 330(a)(1), has Congress even authorized a
district court ­­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, no, no.

But I'm

12

proceeding on the assumption of ­­ on the SG's

13

assumption that what we're trying to do is to get a

14

reasonable rate for the services that clearly have been

15

authorized.

16

rate?

17

And the question is:

What's a reasonable

And it seems to me that what this statute

18

does is to say "reasonable" can include, like, lots of

19

things.

20

It's highly discretionary.

Right?

And then on top of that, you know, it ­­

21

included in "what is reasonable" is this idea of

22

sometimes you can do performance enhancements, but we

23

haven't said performance enhancements are just for

24

super­duper work.

25

enhancements are for things like unusually protracted

We've actually said performance

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

litigation and lots of expenses and exceptional delays,

2

sort of like this.

3

You know, this is just an expense of your

4

work, is having to go after the fees.

5

that get into the mix, too?

6

MR. OLDHAM:

So why doesn't

Well, I would agree with your

7

characterization of the government's position that it is

8

effectively authorizing a broad scope for ­­ for

9

bankruptcy courts to just give enhancements.

10
11

That is

effectively what they're arguing for.
And if I could respond to the government's

12

position, because I think there's at least three things

13

wrong with it.

14

not permit their position.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

First is textually, the text simply will

No, it does, because the

16

text just says "reasonable."

17

what's reasonable?

18

know, you're getting the same hourly rate as some other

19

lawyer, but "reasonable" is, also, you had to do this

20

over a very extended period of time and "reasonable" is,

21

also, boy, you had to spend a lot of money in order to

22

get them to pay you anything at all.

23

things count as what's part of "reasonable."

And then the question is

And "reasonable" can include, you

24

MR. OLDHAM:

25

more point on the text.

All of those

Well ­­ and if I could make one
Section 330(a)(1), if it just

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

said "reasonable," that might be the right answer; but

2

it says "reasonable compensation for services rendered."

3

The government agrees with us that fee

4

litigation work is not a service rendered.

5

Congress says ­­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So when

Yeah, it's reasonable for

7

all the other work you're doing.

8

else goes into this question of reasonable, right?

9

Is ­­ you know, I'll give you a hypothetical.

10

But then everything

Suppose I hire somebody to shovel my

11

driveway, and I say, I'm going to give you reasonable

12

compensation.

13

to hire my driveway, right?

14

And everybody knows that it's $10 an hour
That's the going rate.

But then I say, oh, did I not tell you ­­

15

did I not tell you I'm going to make you go down ­­ come

16

down to the court so that I can pay you the $10?

17

that costs another $5.

And

All right?

18

Now, it strikes me that if somebody said,

19

what's reasonable compensation now, it would be $15.

20

wouldn't be $10.

21

It's like by the time you go through all this stuff that

22

you have to go through to get paid, you should get paid

23

more.

24
25

MR. OLDHAM:

It

And it's the exact same thing here.

Well ­­ and to respond to that

hypothetical, I think the difference is under ­­ in your

nonetheless saying but you can get paid for it anyway.

7

That's effectively ­­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

get paid for it.

That is

But it doesn't say you can't

There's no exclusion.

All, you

10

know ­­ you know, I think you and the SG agree, it's ­­

11

we're not counting this as the service.

12

saying is you have to be reasonably paid for the obvious

13

services that you have performed, shoveling my driveway.

14

What we're

And in my ­­ in my hypothetical, that means

15

you also have to be paid for the cab fare.

16

similarly, here, it means you also have to be paid for

17

the cost of, like, making them sign a check to you.

18

MR. OLDHAM:

And

Well ­­ and, again,

19

textually ­­ I won't belabor ­­ but textually, I think

it disassociates reasonable compensation for services

rendered.

a fair reading of the statute.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't think textually that that works under

Official

1

It's this ­­ it's the clear service rendered, it's

2

shoveling my driveway, it's doing the work for the

3

estate.

4

reasonable is not just the hourly rate, but all the

5

things I've put you through to get the hourly rate.

6

What counts as reasonable?

MR. OLDHAM:

What counts as

And let me give you two other

7

responses to that.

8

just a straight shot at the American Rule, because it's

9

true whenever there's a damages award, that if a damages

One is that that argument is really

10

award is given for, say, $1,000,000 and you have to

11

spend a $100,000 going to defend that, every damages

12

award will be diluted by that $100,000.

13

But this Court has said ­­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

think, with that response.

16

but we're already out of the American rule here.

17

mean, the bankruptcy system puts you in a different

18

universe than a statutory universe, and the question is

19

what do those words of the statute say?

20

would exist if the statute didn't exist.

21

MR. OLDHAM:

But here's the problem, I
It's a reasonable response,
I

It's not what

Well, the American rule applies

22

to litigation, and so obviously, in bankruptcy, you have

23

some litigation, you have some non­litigation.

24

you have a fee litigation matter arise, the American

25

rule certainly applies, and Section 330, doesn't ­­

43
Alderson Reporting Company

But when

because it exists, doesn't mean the American rule, you

2

know, is tossed out the window.

3

controls and you have to look at what Congress actually

4

authorized.

5
6

The American rule still

And so I think, for example, the Court's
decision in Cooter & Gell ­­

Well, the American rule
The statute has to trump the

And if the statute says reasonable

10

compensation for services rendered ­­ the obvious

11

services rendered, and ­­ and the only thing that counts

12

as reasonable is taking into account things like how

13

protracted the litigation is and how much risk you've

14

had and the exceptional delay, and the fact that you've

15

had to contest a lot, a lot, a lot of meritless

objections, all of those things make for something ­­ go

would have come out the other way.

attorney's fee ­­ or under Rule 11, whether you can get

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That case dealt with

And the Court

What about other statutes?

7

I was thinking the same thing, there are other statutes

8

that provide ­­ that undo the American rule, and they

9

say you're entitled, if you're victorious, to reasonable

10

attorney's fees.

11

getting the fees?

12

MR. OLDHAM:

Do they usually include fees for

Under ­­ under classics

13

fee­shifting statutes where Congress ­­ the answer is

14

yes, in a number of those cases, courts have said you

15

get your fees on fees, but those statutes are very

16

different textually, and, I think, in their rationale.

17

Those statutes say that you get your reasonable

18

attorney's fee incurred in an action.

19

fees, when you have a dispute in that action fit within

20

that express authorization by Congress, it is fees

21

incurred in that action.

22

And so, fees on

So textually, that's very different from

23

Section 330, but I also think it's very, very different

24

when you're thinking about the purpose of those

25

fee­shifting statutes.

In the fee­shifting context what

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you have is an award to a private party who has

2

vindicated their statutory rights.

3

that party, there's an award of attorney's fees on top

4

of that, and throughout that process the award comes

5

from the opponent.

6

that you have in the bankruptcy context, where the

7

lawyer and the ­­ and the client get on opposite teams.

8

They're always on the same team.

9

an award, they're fighting for fees on fees, and they

And the award is to

And so you never have the dynamic

They're fighting for

10

both benefit by the more, you know, fees that they get.

11

That's fundamentally different from Section

12

330, which is a very limited authorization

13

it doesn't depend on success in litigation, because

14

that's not the rationale for compensation.

15

rationale for compensation is that you provide services

16

that benefit the estate or that

17

estate.

18

matter what, you have this dynamic where, when fee

19

litigation arises, the professional is suddenly on the

20

opposite team of the estate, because it's always going

21

to be at the expense of the estate.

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, there have been some

studies that have tried to address that and see ­­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. OLDHAM:

Okay.
­­ whether ­­ I mean, I think

10

the argument that we have seen is more of a logical one,

11

that there are more potential objectors in bankruptcy

12

because a ­­ a party has to file their fee application,

13

and theoretically more people get to review it, but I

14

think there's a very strong argument that some courts

15

have accepted that, outside of bankruptcy practice,

16

there's a paying client in every single case who has the

17

full incentive, because they're footing the bill, to

18

study and object and litigate if they want.

19

it's the rare case outside of bankruptcy and it's

20

probably the rare case inside of bankruptcy, where you

21

have full­blown litigation, but it certainly happens in

22

both contexts and outside of litigation.

23

asking for is for the same rule to be in bankruptcy as

24

is out of bankruptcy.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think

And all we're

Well, all right, but if you

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

look at the fee­shifting statutes, we looked up a lot,

2

we found quite a few which say that the court can award

3

a reasonable attorney's fee.

4

MR. OLDHAM:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.
It's broader than here.

6

But the words, basic active words are reasonable

7

attorney's fees, and almost all of them have been

8

interpreted to allow compensation for the reasonable

9

fee.

So they throw that in.

And so, they're counting

10

it as part of the reason ­­ they're counting it as part

11

of a reasonable attorney's fees.

12

attorney's fee is the same.

13

MR. OLDHAM:

that.

20

And here, reasonable

There is a reasonable

But it's hard to make a lot out of

MR. OLDHAM:

Well, when you excerpt just

21

those parts, I agree with you, but I think you have to

22

look at the full language ­­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. OLDHAM:

25

Yeah.
­­ which is in the fee­shifting

context, it is reasonable attorney's fees and then

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

usually it says, incurred, and then it talks about a

2

civil action, like in the Jean case, the Equal Access to

3

Justice Act.

4

Well, it's within the express authorization to get fees

5

on fees there because in that civil action, if there is

6

a fee fight, fees were incurred in that civil action.

7

So if Congress, in Section 330, had said ­­ instead of

8

what it did say, if it had said professionals shall get

9

reasonable attorney's fees in the bankruptcy proceeding,

It says fees incurred in a civil action.

10

then that might be a different case, because there

11

you're saying anything that happens in the bankruptcy

12

proceeding you get compensation for.

13

Congress didn't

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

But there's no ­­ just

2

under all these other statutes, there is so many

3

attorney's fees statutes that ­­

4

MR. OLDHAM:

There are, and let me just say

5

that if we're going to, you know, sort of think about

6

what rule might make sense, I think it's important to

7

remember that the ­­ the fee­shifting statutes, just

8

like Your Honors talked about, where it's true fee

9

shifting, that is, there's a dispute that arises, the

10

loser has to pay the, you know, the attorney's fees for

11

the winner, Congress used that in the bankruptcy code.

12

For example,

13

somebody that commits a willful violation of the

14

automatic stay, Congress identified that particular

15

dispute and said that the loser in that particular case

16

should have to pay it to the winner.

17

in

automatic stay.

If there's

And so if we're thinking about what rule

18

makes sense, I think the government put their finger on

19

it in their brief and talking about it today ­­ and this

20

goes to a question that Justice Alito asked about

21

sanctions ­­ what would make far more sense is for

22

Congress to have come in and created a true fee shifting

23

in which it said that if there's going to a be dispute

24

over a ­­ you know, over a fee application, then maybe

25

the, you know, the prevailing party should have to ­­

50
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

2

should get the attorney's fees from the loser.
Congress didn't do that here.

There's

3

nothing like that under Section 330 or any other

4

statute.

5

compensation to a professional for the work that they do

6

for the estate.

7

Instead, what Congress did is it authorized

And I just want to emphasize too, because

8

I've ­­ I've heard today that ­­ the suggestion that our

9

rule is a per se rule, and that's not at all true.

10

We're not saying that professionals can never get their

11

fees and we embrace the discretion of bankruptcy courts

12

to authorize fees under the long­standing exceptions to

13

the American rule for sanctions such as for frivolous

14

conduct or for bad­faith litigation misconduct.

15

argument has been made that those are, you know, two

16

exceptional, but outside of the bankruptcy context,

17

those longstanding exceptions to the American rule have

18

stood alone as the only exceptions to the American rule.

19

And there's never been any suggestion at all that those

20

are not ­­ those are not sufficient outside of the

21

bankruptcy context.

22

reason for a special rule just in the bankruptcy

23

context.

The

And so I don't think there's any

24

I think it's also really important to keep

25

in mind that Section 330(a) is not just for attorneys.

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

It's for all professionals.

2

say, an accountant that has to go hire their own lawyer,

3

this Court's decision in Lamie made very clear that you

4

can only get compensation under Section 330(a) if you're

5

approved under Section 327(a) for employment.

6

And so in the context of,

It would ­­ it would candidly just go

7

straight through that decision if it was okay for a

8

Section 327(a) professional, to nonetheless go hire

9

somebody, have them do professional services, and then

10

just count it as, you know, the accountant's own

11

professional services, or, as was suggested today, to

12

simply call professional services necessary expense.

13

Which goes against what Congress said in Section

14

330(a)(1)(A), where it ­­ and (B), where it made a very

15

distinct difference between a necessary expense and a

16
17

professional services.

MR. STREETT:

position on this point, because it's not just a small

11

expense that can be counted as overhead.

12

Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases, these National

13

Associations of Trustees point out that the litigation

14

costs will frequently eat up the entire core fee,

15

because it's a modest core fee and all it takes is one

16

debtor rendering an objection or the Chapter 13 trustee

17

rendering an objection.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Section ­­

How do you answer the

19

question about suppose the objection to the fee is

20

sustained?

21

Does the lawyer, nonetheless, get the work?

MR. STREETT:

It would pass the minimal

22

compensability threshold, but courts have consistently

23

exercised their discretion for decades to deny that

24

compensation, because the nature and value of

25

unsuccessful defense is very different from that of a

successful defense.

2

And ASARCO is the one asking this Court to

3

make a major change from the status quo that has

4

prevailed across this country in the overwhelming

5

majority of jurisdictions where courts have wisely and

6

responsibly exercised their discretion to award fees

7

where they are necessary to make the underlying fee

8

reasonable, and to deny fees where the defense is

9

unsuccessful or otherwise wasteful.

Baker Botts is just

10

asking this Court to allow the status quo to continue

11

playing out in a way that's been effective for the

12

bankruptcy system.
