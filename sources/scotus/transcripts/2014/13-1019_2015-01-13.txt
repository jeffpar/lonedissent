ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. GOLDSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
Title VII prohibits the EEOC from suing a

12

private employer unless it first attempts to resolve the

13

claim of discrimination through conciliation.

14

the Court to hold that a court may conduct a modest

15

inquiry into whether the EEOC violated that statute.

16

it did, then the remedy generally is to require

17

conciliation, not to dismiss the suit with prejudice.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

We ask

If

At ­­ at first, I thought

19

this was an Overton Park case committed by law to agency

20

discretion.

21

government's brief to support that, so they have a

22

different theory, and that's more their problem than

23

yours.

24
25

But then I couldn't find many cases in the

On the other hand, it seems to me that Judge
Hamilton in the Seventh Circuit said it's hard to

Alderson Reporting Company

1

imagine more discretionary language than Congress used

2

here, "Shall endeavor to eliminate the unemployment

3

practice by informal methods of conference conciliation

4

and persuasion."

5

difficult words for your position.

6

That seems to me that those are very

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Sure.

So let me,

7

Mr. Justice Kennedy, divide that question into two

8

parts.

9

Park?

What's the analytical framework?
Is it an APA case?

Is it Overton

Is it an implied private

10

right of action case, which is what Judge Hamilton

11

thought, and then turn to the words of the statute and

12

what it means, if we were even to concede, that these

13

are kind of unusual words for a court to administer.

14

So the first is the doctrinal question.

The

15

government agrees that Judge Hamilton got it wrong in

16

putting the burden on us to prove that there was an

17

implied private right of action.

18

suit under Title VII, everyone agrees that there doesn't

19

have to be a special statutory provision.

20

this is a case, like St. Cyr, that it's a case in which

21

the government has to prove, because there is compelled

22

agency action here, the conciliation by the EEOC, that

23

there is clear and convincing evidence that Congress

24

intended to withdraw the ordinary presumption that there

25

is judicial review.

As a precondition to

4
Alderson Reporting Company

We say that

Official

1

So then the government's view, just to put

2

out the third doctrinal framework, the government says,

3

look, we think this is kind of an ordinary statutory

4

construction case, and you should see whether it is that

5

the three provisions of the statute on which they're

6

relying are more consistent or less consistent with

7

judicial review.

8
9

We think that this is clearly a case ­­ we
cite Bowen, for example, in our brief.

We cite a series

10

of cases about Congress having to give very clear

11

evidence of intent to pull the courts out of the job of

12

reviewing the agency action.

13

Now, to take your point that this ­­ and

14

Judge Hamilton's point, that is, this kind of language

15

is both deferential in that it's informal, you just have

16

to endeavor.

17

little bit unusual for courts to undertake.

18

doctrinally, the fact that Congress has given the courts

19

an unusual job is not an excuse or reason for the

20

Executive Branch to tell you that you cannot do the job.

That would turn Chevron on its head.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

There's no obligation at

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

And

5

I think this has to be a point in our favor, the fact

6

that it is unusual.

7

and that is, the EEOC is required to do this with

8

respect to four different statutes.

9

Urban Development Department has to do it and the

Let me tell you how unusual it is;

The Housing and

10

Federal ­­ the Federal Election Commission has to do it.

11

So Congress has laid this out in a series of statutes

12

where it wanted to impose on the agency this special

13

obligation.

14

employee doesn't have to conciliate, the attorney

15

general doesn't have to conciliate, the EEOC doesn't

16

have to conciliate if it's an urgent problem under the

17

statute.

18

Even with respect to Title VII, the private

But Congress thought, and this Court has

19

said many times, that it was especially important that

20

the EEOC try and resolve these cases through

21

conciliation.

22

that the entire design of the statute is that the EEOC

23

will work this out through conciliation, if it possible,

24

but that's the one provision of the statute that is not

25

enforceable.

And it would be passing strange to say

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but at the same time,

2

Mr. Goldstein, and this really follows up on

3

Justice Kennedy's question, the statute makes entirely

4

clear that the EEOC has the prerogative to decide what

5

kind of offer by the employer is acceptable or not.

6

there's nothing to suggest that the EEOC even has to be

reasonable in determining what sort of offer by the

employer is acceptable.

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

after 30 days unless the ­­ it determines that there has

Now, what I think the helpful point for us

16

is that this language acceptable to the Commission is

17

there with respect to the substance, but not the

process.

19

which is the one we're trying to enforce here, which it

20

appears earlier in the page, "If the Commission

21

determines after such investigation that there is

22

reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the

here are the basic things that seem ­­ they ought to be

The statute says that you have to attempt to

And so that ­­ what that should

mean is simply that you're going to give the basics of

your demand in conciliation to the employer so it can

12

evaluate it.

13

Justice Ginsburg, the problem is that ­­

this?

employer?

15
Alderson Reporting Company

2
3

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

It is an important

point ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

So even if the complaining

4

party is willing to accept $500,000 rather than a

5

million, if the EEOC says a million, the EEOC is

6

conciliated.

7
8
9
10
11

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

The EEOC says it's

conciliating.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, no.

Under the law,

you tell me it is conciliated.
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Right.

The EEOC's

12

position ­­ that is correct, yes, full stop.

13

is a problem.

14

because it does bring about 130 cases a year, to pick

15

out the cases that it wants to be very high profile.

16

wants to send a message to employers.

17

you articulated they are concerned with this employer.

18

The difficulty for them is if they conciliate, Congress

19

required that that remain entirely confidential.

20

the problem is that we have an agency that has an

21

enormous incentive in the cases that it picks out to

22

bypass the mandatory process that Congress imposed.

23

And this

The EEOC has an enormous incentive,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It

Justice Ginsburg,

And so

Mr. Goldstein, could we talk

24

about that confidentiality provision?

25

addition to just the enormous discretion that this

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Because in

Official

1

statute gives to the EEOC, the other thing that tends to

2

work against you is this thing:

3

part of these informal endeavors can be used as evidence

4

in a subsequent proceeding.

Nothing said or done as

5

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Yes.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And your entire position

7

would have all the stuff about this conciliation come in

8

as evidence in a subsequent proceeding, which is to say,

9

come in as evidence in the litigation of the lawsuit.

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

Just to pause briefly

11

on the premise that there is enormous discretion, that

12

is the premise of Chevron deference, not courts not

13

enforcing a statute.

14
15
16
17

But to turn to the confidentiality
provision, remember that the EEOC ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm just saying as a matter

of fact ­­

18

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Okay.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

­­ there is discretion in

20

the sense that the statute clearly gives it to the EEOC

21

to decide what's acceptable in the end.

22

MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Absolutely, Justice Kagan.

23

But that is true across a range of statutes that impose

24

a procedural obligation.

25

Now, confidentiality.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Let's start from the

Official

1

point that the EEOC didn't read the statute this way

2

until four decades after it was enacted.

3

good reason for that.

4

is that when Congress enacted the statute, the reference

5

to a "subsequent proceeding" in the text unquestionably

6

was the merits of the case, because the EEOC ­­ there

7

was never this fight because the EEOC didn't have that

8

enforcement power.

9

It read it our way.

And there's a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

The reason

But you yourself are

10

making this part of the case.

11

that the EEOC has to come in and prove that it

12

conciliated in good faith or whatever term you want.

13

it's become now, by virtue of your own argument, part of

14

the case.

15

how is all this to happen unless the informal ­­ what's

16

said and done in the informal endeavors come in.

17

You're essentially saying

So

And how is that to be part of the case and

And I'm trying to pose a

10

question where it seems to me that it would be utterly

13

I am very troubled by the idea that the

14

government can do something and we can't even look at

15

whether they've complied with the law.

16

troubled by the idea that the scope of our judicial

17

review is limited.

18

which it is, is it that there's no authority for a court

19

to review government action alleged to be in violation

20

of law, or is it that the scope of judicial review for

21

various reasons is sharply circumscribed?

22

I'm not terribly

And I just wanted you to tell me

MS. SAHARSKY:

JUSTICE BREYER:

where we are.

I'm going to get you to focus on just what you want to

say, that the framework in which I'm putting it is of

there is very broad discretion given to the EEOC.

give an example through the use of the case.

Now, that's where I am.

And since I think

that's what you want ­­ something like that is what you

want to argue, I'm asking you for help how to write

that.

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

Right.

And what I'm saying

10

is that there is ­­ the way not to write that is by

11

relying on a good­faith standard, because I think you

have a misimpression about the courts of appeals, and

13

how it has been working in the courts of appeals, which

14

is some of the courts have adopted a good­faith

standard, but they are putting very onerous requirements

decision that the Court should write should focus on

what the obligation is that's on the EEOC, the

particular text that Congress enacted.

obligation that's on the EEOC is that before it can sue,

nothing.

supposed to do is if it's controverted, look at the

In this case, for example, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there are

9

MS. SAHARSKY:

There is also review by the

10

President and by Congress, Congressional committees.

11

There are actually reports that are required every year

12

to Congress in the statute itself.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Ms. Saharsky, I don't even

14

agree with you about the incentives.

15

other side points out, there is considerable incentive

16

on the EEOC to fail in conciliation so that it can bring

17

a big­deal lawsuit and get a lot of press and put a lot

18

of pressure on this employer and on other employers.

19

There are real incentives to have conciliation fail.

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think, as the

I don't think that that's

21

true in most cases; and even in high­profile cases where

the EEOC may believe that there's a very serious,

So there are ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Alright. I know what your

position is, but assume ours is just the hypothetical.

7

It doesn't mean you've lost, but ours is that we have to

8

give some teeth to judicial review greater than what

9

you're suggesting.

10

Justice Kennedy asked you once.

I'm asking

11

you ­­ or I asked you once before, he's asked again, and

it that gives you the least ­­ the less intrusion ­­ the

19

least intrusion but more than what you want to do.

20

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes.

And to be frank, the

21

reason that this is a struggle is because the courts of

22

appeals, even those that have tried to put a minimum

23

good faith standard in place, have seen these standards

24

spiral out of control and lead to significant collateral

25

litigation.

Alderson Reporting Company

So I don't mean ­­ I understand the effort

2

that you're looking for, Justice Sotomayor, and I will

3

do my best to provide that guidance; but I'm telling you

4

that even in the three circuits that have tried to use a

5

minimal good­faith standard, they have been scrutinizing

6

everything that the EEOC has been doing, all of the

7

letters back and forth.

8
9

You've gotten into situations where you're
even deposing EEOC investigators in district courts, and

10

that's one thing that ­­ if I could just back up,

11

because I think this is a really important point, is

12

that there are four various, serious problems that this

13

has led to in the district courts and in the courts of

14

appeals.

15

We're talking about mini trials on a

16

collateral issue that's not the merits of the

17

discrimination but on this question of whether the EEOC

18

tried hard enough, and it is not the case that the EEOC

is failing to conciliate.

you look at the statute and the text that Congress

enacted, it reflects a recognition that what Congress

was defining, an informal endeavor to settle a case, is

the kind of thing that shouldn't be public and that

shouldn't be the subject of court proceedings.

opposite?

7

MS. SAHARSKY:

of far­reaching judicial review that is sought in this

And that's really a bar on the type

I mean, Petitioner's view essentially

14

destroys the benefits of informal settlement processes

15

because the benefits of them are that they can be

16

informal, that they can be cheap, that they can be

17

quick, and that they stay confidential.

18

Now, nothing's going to stay confidential.

19

Employers don't have an incentive to conciliate, and

20

that courts have to expend this massive effort on

21

something ­­ and I think this is an important point ­­

22

that's really ancillary to the main event.

ago that employees have no incentive to conciliate.

That's not true.

I direct

16

the Court to Footnote 13 in our brief, which is where

17

lawyers for these employers are directing them to treat

18

the conciliation effort as one to set up a defense for

trial.

20

So I'm not suggesting that there is just

21

necessarily bad faith.

22

that this is happening, the results of what has happened

standards is that there's been a real problem with folks

But the second point, and this goes to the

12

first thing you suggested, is that the commission is

13

required to make a reasonable cause determination, and

14

that does provide notice to the employer about what has

been found through the investigation.

about what that is, I would point the Court to the

talks about, even when a court said it's just good faith

10

MS. SAHARSKY:

Yes, then the agency would do

that.

12

because what it does instead of setting out regulations,

13

because it doesn't believe that this gives a private

right to ­­ to employers to enforce, is it has its own

15

training procedures about good ways to do conciliation

JUSTICE BREYER:

I ­­ I'm not a conciliator

Two, the commission does as a general rule

Third, though, there are tactics in

conciliations where one side might wait for the other

4

side to make an offer, et cetera, et cetera.

5

really that kind of second­guessing that we think is a

6

serious problem.

7

And it's

One thing that I think is useful is to step

8

back and look at what would happen under our view of the

9

world as opposed to Petitioner's view of the world.

10

Under our view of the world, we believe that the EEOC is

11

conciliating and has significant incentives to

12

conciliate.

13

case is a trial about the employment discrimination on

14

the merits, that we actually move on to the main event

15

and answer the question, which is ­­ that the EEOC has

16

been investigating:

17

we typically see that as a good thing in our American

18

society.

But if we're wrong about that, the worst

employment discrimination, and that's what we're trying

to do.

has there been employment discrimination, as opposed to
