ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ORTIZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case asks whether the felon in

12

possession statute prevents the court from ordering the

13

government to transfer firearms in its possession that

14

are owned by a felon to ­­ to a suitable third party.

15

government now concedes that a court can order transfer

16

to a licensed gun dealer, who will then sell the

17

firearms on the owner's behalf.

18
19
20

That concession alone requires reversal.
Neither court below understood that it had such power.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why isn't ­­ is that

21

enough for your client?

23

firearms dealer sell them for him?

court shouldn't have that power unless the public

that we think it's okay ­­ a practical reason why we

think it's okay for the felon to suggest or say where

I mean, this is ­­ this constructive

In other words, you know, I give it to my

wife, I give it to my best friend, and I'm really in a

MS. O'CONNELL:

I ­­ I agree with you,

3

Justice Kagan, that it makes perfect sense to look at

4

whether the felon has control over the person that gets

the firearms, but I think there's a separate time period

that we need to look at during the sale to determine

whether he's exercising dominion and control over the ­­

Where does all this come

I mean, to me, when somebody uses the word

10

"constructive X," that just means it's not X and ­­ and

11

it's a way of pretending that it's X when it isn't.

12

So I start with that and say what you're

13

worried about here ­­ of course, he doesn't have any

14

possession of it.

he wants to do is he wants to put it somewhere so he

can't get ahold of it as long as the law prevents him

MS. O'CONNELL:

We have ­­ the cases we've

cited ­­ I want to draw your attention to the cases

13

we've cited on pages 25 and 26 of our brief that involve

14

convicted felons who are out in the world and they are

15

negotiating sales of firearms.

16

And they are saying, Hey, buyer, do you want

17

to buy this firearm?

18

then since I can't possess them, I'm going to have

19

somebody else drop them off.

Let's negotiate the terms.

things that you were just talking about happen.
And you look to see how much trouble it is,

3

what's likely to happen, and where it makes sense.

4

if it isn't likely for these bad things to happen, fine.

5

MS. O'CONNELL:

And

Those cases, though, are not

6

concerned with we ­­ we want to double check on who the

7

buyer is and see if that buyer is going to be subject to

8

the convicted felon's control.

9

felon's ability to move guns around throughout the

They are looking at the

world.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that seems to me very

12

different than the situation here, Ms. O'Connell,

13

because in that case, what the gang leader has is a

14

situation where somebody else is holding a gun for him

15

and he can say anything to that person.

16

the gun.

17

can say, Sell it to Person A or Person B or Person C.

18

He has total freedom over it.

He can say, Use

He

And that's very different from the situation

20

here where the only thing that a person would ­­ a

21

person in Mr. Henderson's position can do is to sell the

22

gun to a person whom the court approves.

23

MS. O'CONNELL:

I don't ­­ I don't think

24

that any of the cases that I was just referring to

25

involve situations where the convicted felon has control

26
Alderson Reporting Company

1

over the person that's receiving the gun.

2

just have to do with the convicted felon's ability make

3

a gun appear somewhere when he says to and to show that

4

he ­­ he ­­ he's exercising dominion and control over

5

the guns by negotiating the terms of their sale and

6

identifying buyers for them.

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All of them

Yeah, but he doesn't ­­ he

8

doesn't have to get anybody to approve the buyer.

9

think what Justice Kagan is saying, it's ­­ it's a lot

I

10

harder to say you have dominion and control when you

11

have to come before an equity court and say, Please, may

12

I, you know ­­ please may I have ­­ have the gun given

13

to my best friend or to somebody else.

14

sound much like dominion and control to me.

15

MS. O'CONNELL:

That doesn't

We ­­ we acknowledge that

16

because the guns are in our possession and the

17

Petitioner needs a court order in order for them to go

18

somewhere, that the court is exercising, also, some

19

control over the weapons; but by reserving this right to

20

nominate somebody to receive them, the convicted felon

21

is also exercising control over the weapons.

22

I'll point out that in the Petitioner's

23

opening brief when he described the main attributes of

24

possession, he said the right to control and the right

25

to exclude.

And his theory in the reply brief that, oh,

27
Alderson Reporting Company

2

of the right to exclude other people from getting their

3

14

with our constructive possession theory, I think that's

15

probably where Justice Scalia is and I don't know how

16

many other people are in that boat, but I think the

17

Court should certainly make clear in its opinion that

18

because the ­­ the district court looking at this relief

19

is sitting in equity, it is not required to broker a

20

sale between a convicted felon and his friend.

8

anticipate ­­ what was your position before you changed

9

it here in this Court about what should happen to the

10
11

guns?
MS. O'CONNELL:

I mean, I think in the

12

Eleventh Circuit, Federal law enforcement officers that

13

have these guns and are trying to decide what to do with

14

them when they get the request coming in from the felons

15

were ­­ were certainly under the impression that Howell

16

controlled and that they certainly couldn't give it to

17

somebody that was selected by the convicted felon, but

18

also that they couldn't sell it.

19
20

And ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Has the Federal

government ever used these guns?

21

MS. O'CONNELL:

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, and if we ­­
Not these particular

23

ones but guns that were forfeited by a convicted felon

24

and someone who couldn't sell them to anyone, at least

25

until you changed the position and said they could sell

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

them to a firearms dealer?

2

gathering dust?

3

MS. O'CONNELL:

They just sat around

They ­­ they do, because we

4

don't ­­ if the opinion is affirmed, if there's, you

5

know, nothing to do with these guns, we don't gain title

6

to them.

7

In a lot of the court of appeals cases that present this

8

issue, when the convicted felon filed his Rule 41(g)

9

motion, the government filed, in response, a motion to

I think there would need to be an extra step.

10

prefer permission to destroy the firearms, or something

11

like that.

12

We wouldn't gain title to them.

13

But there is nothing like that in this case.

But ­­ but we think ­­ we do agree that our

14

position, maybe not necessarily in this case, because

15

the relief that Petitioner was asking for was always to

16

have it transferred to somebody in specific; but I

17

completely agree that we have said in briefs before, we

18

understood Howell to also prohibit a sale.

19

So what I think the appropriate relief for

20

this Court to ­­ what the Court should do to dispose of

21

the case would be to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's

22

holding that the convicted felon cannot select somebody

23

to receive his firearms, but then remand for ­­ if the

you're ­­ I'm a little bit upset at your brief, frankly,

because in that circuit, he couldn't know that there was

any permissible sale, because that circuit had said

none.

And so to come back and say to us that we

8

should leave it in their discretion as to whether it

trap for a pro se litigant.

We are ­­ we are certainly

13

not trying to do that.

14

just articulated was if the Court agrees with what we've

15

said in our brief and our view of constructive

possession, it should affirm what the Eleventh Circuit

I mean, your whole

argument ­­ the reason I took it that the government

wants this firearm thing, firearm dealer, is they say,

18

look, there are a lot of guns and these guns should be

19

safe and we're afraid he'll give them to a friend, and

20

we're afraid maybe the gang boss will get them, and the

only safe thing to do is really the firearms dealer.

case.
