CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

Legislature v. The Arizona Independent Redistricting

Commission.

Mr. Clement.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

12

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Proposition 106 permanently divests the

13

State legislature of its authority to prescribe

14

congressional districts and redelegates that authority

15

to an unelected and unaccountable commission.

16

Elections Clause of the Constitution clearly vests that

17

authority not just in the States, but in the

18

legislatures thereof.

19

redelegate that authority to an unelected and

20

unaccountable commission is plainly repugnant to the

21

Constitution's vesting of that authority in the

22

legislatures of the States.

23

The

Thus, this avowed effort to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it's all right for

24

the State redistricting.

25

there's no constitutional question with the ­­ Arizona

The commission is ­­ is ­­

1

being able to use this commission for its State

2

representation.

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg.

4

It only applies to the ­­ our argument only applies to

5

the congressional redistricting.

6

means that if these commissions are as effective as my

7

friends on the other side say, then we will have

8

nonpartisan districts that will elect the State house ­­

9

the State houses, the State representatives, and the

And, of course, that

10

State senate, and then those nonpartisanly

11

gerrymandered, perfectly representative bodies will be

12

the ones to take care of congressional districting.

13

So ­­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, I just want

15

to clarify your position.

16

lack of legislative control is at issue only or are you

17

saying that we have to overturn Hildebrant and Smiley?

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Are you suggesting that the

Oh, you certainly don't have

19

to overturn Hildebrant and Smiley.

20

that those decisions cut in our favor because what those

21

decisions stand for is, Smiley in particular ­­ I mean,

22

the Court was emphatic that the legislature was a term

23

of certain meaning at the Constitution, at the framing

24

of the Constitution, that it means then what it means

25

now, which is a representative body of the people.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

We actually think

Official

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's sort of hard to

2

understand because we made it very clear in Smiley and

3

in Hildebrant that we're defining legislature in this

4

clause as meaning legislative process.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

With ­­ with all due respect,

6

I disagree.

7

in Smiley, and one side was saying just that.

8

one side was saying, oh, legislature just means the

9

legislative process in the State, whatever that is.

This Court heard the argument in the briefs
The ­­

The

10

other side said, no, it means the representative body of

11

the people.

12

And this Court said, well, actually we don't

13

have to decide that dispute, but we certainly agree that

14

it means the representative body of the people, just as

15

we said five years earlier in the Hawke case.

16

the Court said is, first, the delegee is clearly the

17

legislature, the representative body of the people.

18

But that brings you, then, to the second

So what

19

question, which is what kind of authority is delegated

20

to the State legislatures.

21

granted under the Elections Clause is a lawmaking

22

authority, so that means that the State legislature has

23

to engage in lawmaking subject to the normal rules ­­

24
25

And the authority that's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I ­­ but ­­ but this

makes no sense to me, because I think it's an either/or.

5
Alderson Reporting Company

1

If the legislature has the power, how can the governor

2

veto it?

3

they have the power or they don't.

How can a popular referendum veto it?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Either

I disagree ­­
And if a State

6

constitution says that the people hold the power and

7

they can choose a commission or however else they want

8

to do it, isn't that the legislative process?

9

MR. CLEMENT:

No, it's not.

But, I mean, I

10

disagree with you, Justice Sotomayor, but that's not

11

particularly important.

12

I actually think the Court in Smiley

13

disagrees with that way of thinking about it.

14

say is that the delegee remains the same.

15

Hawke, it is the State legislature, the representative

16

body.

17

legislature is told that it can elect somebody or ratify

18

something, then there's no partial agency of anybody

19

else in that process.

20

prescribe rules, the Court says that's a delegation of

21

lawmaking authority, so of course you delegate ­­ of

22

course the State legislature does its lawmaking pursuant

23

to the ordinary rules.

has to spend 30 days in committee, then those rules

Alderson Reporting Company

apply to the lawmaking under the Elections Clause, just

2

as they would to other lawmaking.

3

But it's a completely different matter to

4

say we're going to cut the State legislature out

5

entirely, and we are going to revisit the framers'

6

decision to delegate this important responsibility to

7

the State legislatures.

8

it to an entirely different body and a body that has the

9

one feature we know that a representative body doesn't

10

have, which is this commission is completely unelected

11

and completely unaccountable to the people.

12

And we're going to redelegate

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could Congress ­­ could

13

Congress do that?

14

commission for the State's legislature?

15

Could Congress substitute this

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't believe that Congress

16

could say that at the State level, we're going to

17

redelegate this authority from the State legislatures to

18

the State commissions or to independent commissions.

19

Congress wants to do it itself on the Federal level and

20

set up some sort of Federal commission, I think that

21

would be a very different issue because obviously

22

Congress has power under the second subclause.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If

But couldn't ­­ could

24

Congress bless what Arizona has done by saying that's a

25

matter in which Federal elections will be held?

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think they could

2

simply bless what Arizona has done because I think that

3

would amount to revisiting the judgment that the framers

4

made in the first subclause.

5

I think that they could ­­ if they wanted

6

to, Congress could say, we're going to actually take

7

those commission districts and we're going to make them

8

our own, and we're going to impose them.

9

be different.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that would

So you're saying it has to

11

be a Federal commission or a State commission, but if

12

it's the latter, it can be only the legislature.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

I ­­ I think that's right.

14

Though, of course, it could be an advisory commission.

15

What we object to is not just the idea that

16

there is a commission.

17

permanent wresting of authority from the State

18

legislature.

19

What we object to is the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose you had a ­­ a law

20

that said that the reapportion commission has ­­ must

21

submit its proposal to the legislature, and the

22

legislature has 30 days and can overturn it only by a

23

three­quarters vote.

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

would be a harder case.

I think, Justice Kennedy, that
And I think that this Court,

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

however they decide this case, could decide that either

2

way.

3

Now, the question I think you would ask is:

4

Does that residual authority for the State legislature

5

there amount to the authority to prescribed districts?

6

And I think you could decide that either way.

7

say, well, they're not cut out completely.

8

the residual authority, and three­fourths is tough, but

9

maybe you can get it done.

You could

They have

Or you could say ­­ and I

10

think this might be the better view in my view ­­ but

11

you could say, no, what you can do under Smiley and

12

Hildebrandt is apply the ordinary rules for legislation

13

to the State legislatures, but what you can't do is come

14

up with some separate rules that apply only to

15

congressional redistricting and make it much harder for

16

the State legislature to act.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your phrase "completely

18

cut out" probably answers the question, what about voter

19

ID laws, what about absentee ballots, and so forth that

20

are provisions enacted by referendum?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

23

Right.
You would say those are

okay because the legislature is not completely cut out?

24

I would say probably so.
Or you ­­

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it might depend on the

details a little bit.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Clement, how about

4

that, because I thought that the legislature was

5

completely cut out as to most of those things.

6

you take the 2011 law in Mississippi adopting voter ID

7

requirements; 2007, Oregon, voting by mail; 1962,

8

Arkansas, use of voting machines.

9

these things were done by referendum or by initiative

I mean,

All of things ­­

10

with the legislative process completely cut out.

11

would all of those be unconstitutional as well?

12

And we can go further.

13

zillions of these laws.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

I mean, there are

And ­­ and let me

15

address those laws, Justice Kagan, and also be

16

responsive to Justice Kennedy.

17

So

I think there is ­­ if you look at the

18

various laws that are put in the Appellees' appendix,

19

not one of those State constitutional provisions

20

purports to, on its face, redelegate authority away from

21

the State legislatures.

22

them, roughly half ­­ I counted 27 ­­ actually delegate

23

authority to the State legislatures to implement them.

So if you want to look at the North Carolina provision

And to the contrary, many of

MR. CLEMENT:

9

All they are is laws

Exactly.
Not through the legislature.
Exactly.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We don't think

No, but, I mean, my gosh.

would think that if your primary argument is legislature

10

means legislature, that there has to be a legislative

11

control, in none of these laws is there legislative

12

control.

13

I

There's no legislative participation at all.

MR. CLEMENT:

See, Justice Kagan, we

14

distinguish two situations.

15

you know, the problem with Proposition 106 is that

16

simply that it was done by initiative and not by the

17

legislature, but that's actually not our position.

18

would have the same objections here if this were imposed

19

by gubernatorial edict.

20

We could be here saying,

We

And we know that the rule that should emerge

21

from this case is not that nobody but the legislature

22

can ever do anything with elections on a one­off basis,

23

and the way we know that is this Court has already said

24

that it's okay for a judicial body let's ­­ like a State

25

court, to do redistricting on a one­off basis.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how do you ­­ how do

2

you make that consistent with the text that you are ­­

3

the textual argument that you are making?

4

argument that you are making is legislature means

5

legislature.

6

you're saying that there are these many, many, many laws

7

throughout the United States in which the rules are not

8

being made by a legislature.

9

because the legislature isn't involved at all.

10

The textual

There's no two ways around that.

MR. CLEMENT:

But now

And that's perfectly okay

Two things, Justice Kagan.

11

See, our position is not the problem here is that

12

somebody else got into the legislature's lane and

13

purported to do something about elections.

14

is once they got in that lane, they decided to wrest the

15

legislature from that process entirely on a permanent

16

basis.

17

Our problem

Now, as to a more specific answer to your

18

question, I would invoke this Court's case in McPherson

19

against Blacker which dealt with an analogous clause in

20

Article II that gives the State legislatures the

21

authority to prescribe the rules for presidential

22

electors.

23

sort of a practical view of the matter, which is, look,

24

if ­­ if the State legislature sort of lets other parts

25

of the State do something, we're not going to jump in.

And what this Court said there ­­

4

Constitution, and what they mean is it protects the

5

legislature from other parts of the State coming in and

6

permanently wresting that authority away ­­

7

But the words in each ­­ "in the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I thought that the ­­

8

9

jurisprudence, abdication is just as consequential as

In other words, it doesn't matter what the

12

legislature wants.

13

that's fine, go do it, we don't care about it.

14

is a problem, the problem continues to exist

15

irrespective of whether the legislature protests or not.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

The legislature could have said, oh,
If there

Well, that's not the way the

17

Court approached this issue in McPherson.

18

suggest that it's the same way to approach it here,

19

which is to say, I think the Court recognized in

20

McPherson ­­

21

­­ that nothing would prevent a State legislature from

22

delegating its authority to one of these commissions.

23

that you ­­ if ­­ what they did is propose a referendum

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I do think

remote because the legislature in Arizona ­­ correct me

One of the ironies is that my friends on the

11

other side like to talk about the power of the people,

12

but the maps that the commission promulgates are not

13

subject to override by referendum the way the maps of

14

the legislature were before Proposition 106 passed.

15

So I think all the legislature could do is

16

what any citizen could do which is to propose an

17

alternative map by initiative process.

18

that is, that's not the primary power to prescribe

19

congressional districts or to make election regulations.

people, and we know ­­

One is, that

allows the State legislature to prescribe the

14

congressional districts.

15

that hard, Justice Kagan, and let's look at the

16

commissions that exist in the real world, okay?

18

theory suggests that they are constitutionally

19

problematic.

20

You

Now, nothing in our

You have others that are what are called

backup commissions, which is they don't have a veto, but

22

if the legislature, because there's a stalemate and one

house is the democrats, one house is the republicans,

24

they just can't get it done, then a backup commission

25

comes in.

I don't think that's problematic.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What if the commission says,

2

We're going to give you two maps, the legislature has to

3

pick one and only one?

MR. CLEMENT:

I would think that that's

5

probably unconstitutional, but I don't think that ­­ I

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But why is that

8

unconstitutional and an impasse in the legislature and

9

leaving it then to a third­party who is not the

10

legislature, why is that constitutional?

11

you just said, that's constitutional.

12

MR. CLEMENT:

That's what

It is, and the reason I say

13

that is because if the legislature has the primary

14

authority and they can't get it done, then we know, as a

15

matter of fact, that somebody else is going to provide

16

that rule.

17

legislature gets stalemate, what happens in the real

18

world of course is you can't use the existing maps

19

because they violate one vote ­­ one­person, one­vote

20

principles and so the State courts come in.

Could I ask you this

When you look at the ­­ the ­­ the

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, there actually is a

22

tremendous amount on this particular clause.

23

making the point that there's less about the first

subclause than the second subclause, I suppose I would

25

grant you that, but part of the reason there was less

20
Alderson Reporting Company

If you're

Official

1

discussion of the first subclause is it seemed so

2

remarkably obvious to the framers that if this was going

3

to be done at the State level by anyone, of course it

4

would be done by the representative body of the people.

5

And it's not like they didn't know about

6

popular lawmaking.

conception of what a referendum would be or an

8

initiative would be, they simply said, We like

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought ­­ I thought ­­

11

Mr. Clement, I thought that the initiative and

12

referendum came in later, that at the time of the

13

founding, and the initiative and the referendum weren't

14

used by State legislatures.

15

MR. CLEMENT:

They weren't in ­­ the

16

initiative and the referendum as we came to know them in

17

the early ­­ early 20th century, late 19th century were

18

not in used at frame­ ­­ the time of the framing, but

19

direct democracy was.

20

said there ought to be conventions to approve the

21

Constitution, not ­­ they shouldn't be approved just by

22

votes of the State legislature.

23

I mean, the framers themselves

The framers when they formulated Article V

24

and had alternative mechanisms that the Federal Congress

25

could choose to provide for ratification, they gave the

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

choice of State legislatures or the people in

2

convention.

3

So the Congress ­­ the framers understood

4

the difference between direct democracy and

5

representative democracy, and they made a conscious

6

choice.

7

framers didn't know the difference between the people

8

and the State legislatures in the context of Federal

9

elections, because there they are creating a house

And indeed, it's really hard to argue that the

10

elected by the people and a senate appointed by the

11

State legislatures, and when they get to the voter

12

qualification clause they say, Well, the people are

13

But you see, Mr. Clement,

19

that suggests a very pure rule and ­­ and on occasion

20

you said something like this, a legislature means a

21

legislature, and that's what it means, and so a

22

legislature has to do all those things.

23

But you've made many, many exemptions to

24

that over the course of the last 20 minutes.

these kinds of different schemes about the interaction

going to be have to reviewed on a case­by­case basis to

6

determine whether the legislature has primary control.

7

And when you get through with all that, the

8

sort of purity of the originalist argument that a

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think, for the most

part, that's what this Court has already said.

White v. Weiser says that in the initial challenge

phase, that if there's time, you let the legislature do

it.

Now, this Court has also said ­­

plan stays in place until it does.

that that's as much of a displacement as what you're

talking about here.

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah, it is a displacement.

It's not as much.
I ­­ I may have been confusing things.

I'm

4

talking about ­­ there's two different circumstances,

5

right?

6

very early and there's still time for the legislature,

7

essentially, to take a second crack at a

8

constitutionally compliant plan.

One is when the redistricting plan is challenged

9

And I read White v. Weiser to say that if

10

there is that kind of time, then you allow the State

11

legislature to do it, because it's their primary task.

12

Then the second question is, if there's not

13

time and then there is a judicial plan, and let's say

14

the first cycle of elections takes place under the

15

judicial plan.

16

as generally suggesting, even then, there's nothing that

17

prevents the State legislature, certainly, from going in

18

and redistricting.

19

Now, I actually read this Court's cases

And this Court, in the Perry case, for

20

example, rejected the idea that it's like you got one

21

shot at this and then you're done for the whole

22

decennial census.

23

Now, there's at least one State, Colorado,

24

that's basically said that if you get into that

25

situation, then you got to live with the judicial plan

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

until the next census; but then the legislature still

2

kicks in and has the primary role.

Now, I'm inclined to think that what

Colorado has done is inconsistent with the Elections

5

Clause.

question.

13

means anything at all in terms of its delegation of this

14

responsibility to the State legislatures, maybe we can

15

talk about taking part of it away, but they can't take

16

the entire thing away on a permanent basis and give it

17

to a commission that's defining feature is that it's not

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING APPELLEES
MR. FEIGIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

and may it please the Court:

2

I'd like to make one main point on standing

3

before I turn to a couple points on the statutory

4

Section 2a(c) issue.

5

On standing, this is an extremely unusual

6

and unprecedented Federal lawsuit in which a State

7

legislature is asking a Federal court for assurance that

8

if it passed a certain kind of law, which it hasn't even

9

alleged that it's going to pass, the law would be

10

enforced by a defendant State official who hasn't even

11

denied that she would enforce it.

12

We don't normally conceive of legislatures

13

as having an interest, let alone an interest cognizable

14

under Article III, in the enforcement of laws they might

15

pass.

16

or the decision of the Arizona courts interpreting that

17

constitution ­­

18

And there's nothing in the Arizona Constitution

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Feigin, isn't this a

19

diminution of the power to legislate, not of a

20

particular plan or of a particular law and plan?

21

is the removal of power from the legislature.

22

MR. FEIGIN:

This

No, it isn't, Your Honor,

23

because I don't think there's anything that actually, as

24

a practical matter, prevents the legislature from

25

passing a bill that would redistrict the State, which

28
Alderson Reporting Company

they believe, in good faith, that they can do under

2

their view of the Elections Clause.

3

The ­­ there are numerous cases, some of

don't have standing to challenge what the referendum has

But let me put to one side the ­­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, don't they

5

just have to, under that theory, just allege that they

6

plan to exercise what had, up to this point, been their

7

normal authority to engage in the redistricting?

8

MR. FEIGIN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, Your Honor ­­
I suspect the fact

10

that they're litigating it implies that they have some

11

interest in doing that.

12

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, I think that could be

13

said of almost any litigation.

14

for them to actually coalesce on some particular

15

redistricting plan, but I don't think that's a reason to

16

excuse them from the normal standing requirements.

17

But if I could just put their ­­ the absence

18

of an allegation that they pass a law to one side for a

19

second, let's assume they had passed their own

20

legislative redistricting plan, presented it to the

21

Secretary of State, and the Secretary of State had said,

22

No, I'm going with the commission's plan because that's

23

what State law requires me to do.

24
25

And it may be difficult

I still don't think that they would have
standing here because, again, legislatures don't have an

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

interest in the enforcement of the laws that they pass,

2

as a general matter.

3

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They have an interest in

the constitutional powers they have.
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, let me give

6

you an example that I think is fairly analogous to this

7

case and really crystallizes the point.

8
9

Let's suppose that Congress passed a law
that preempted State regulation in some area, and let's

10

further suppose there were colorable constitutional

11

challenge to that law.

12

Now, I don't think anyone would believe that

13

the State legislature, acting in its own name, would be

14

the proper party to bring that constitutional challenge

15

on the theory that its police powers have been infringed

16

by the preemptive Federal statute.

If

Is it part of our

10

jurisprudence that if it's likely that another person is

11

more directly affected, that that goes into the balance

12

and we say, Well, the legislature doesn't have standing

13

because there are other people out there that are more

14

directly affected?

15

MR. FEIGIN:

Do we say this in our cases?
No, Your Honor.

And I ­­ I

16

think, in fact, you say quite the opposite, which is

17

that even if it would mean no one would have standing to

18

sue, that's not a reason to find standing.

19

the legislature simply doesn't have standing to sue here

20

regardless of whether anyone else does.

21

And we think

But if the Court were to reach the merits, I

25

because the Court decided all the relevant issues in

5

when the State has not, under its law, redistricted.

6

It's meant to apply

Here, there's no doubt the State has

7

redistricted under its law.

8

law is valid.

9

But I don't

MR. FEIGIN:

The question is whether the

Well, sir, Your Honor, I'd like

10

to turn back to Hildebrant in a second; but just to take

11

your question on, I think the operation of the prefatory

12

clause here is best understood in context.

13

A neighboring Federal statute, 2 U.S.C. 2c

14

requires that, as a matter of Federal statutory law,

15

states be divided into districts for the purpose of

16

electing congressional representatives.

17

question of Federal statutory law, how that districting

18

requirement is met and whether it is met.

19

That makes it a

And that's the question that Section 2a(c)

20

answers.

21

procedures that we prescribed is going to apply until a

22

State is redistricted in the manner provided by the law

23

thereof.

24
25

Section 2a(c) says one of these default

I think the necessary and logical corollary
of that is that once the State is redistricted in the

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

manner divided by the law thereof, those are the

2

districts that are going to be used.

3

believe Congress would have expected anything different

4

and, in fact, given that they are legislating in light

5

of Hildebrant, that is exactly what they would have

6

expected.

7

It's hard to

Hildebrant, in construing the nearly

8

identical language of the 1911 Act, said, first of all,

9

that the statutory language had the express purpose to

provide the direct democracy features ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

22

case may have been enacted.

It's just an assumption in which a

10

I guess the bottom­line

11

question is:

12

different, which is we removed redistricting from the

legislature, and we require every State to pass it by ­­

14

redistricting by referendum.

that Congress has the power to override the

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

19

that would exactly be overriding the Constitution.

20

there were such a law, we might defend it, but I don't

21

think we need to go that far in this case for two

22

important reasons.

23

If

First, Congress here isn't trying to force

24

upon the States some process that the State doesn't

25

want.

Congress is simply trying to recognize that the

35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Federal statutory requirement of districting is

2

satisfied when a State redistricts in the manner that

3

its decided to redistrict under its own procedures.

I

4

would think that the power of Congress should be at its

5

apex when both Congress and the State want to do the

6

same thing.

7
8
9

The second thing I would say is that in this
circumstance ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, no, not ­­ not if

10

the same thing violates the Constitution.

11

because Congress agrees with a State that they can do

12

it, does that make it constitutional?

Well, Your ­­
The objection here is a

constitutional objection.
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I do think

this is within the authority of Congress.

18

come at it a slightly different way, which is, my friend

I'd like you to because as

I read those two cases, they don't help you very much.

11

I mean, Hildebrant is talking about a particular statute

12

that was passed in 1911 and it helps the government with

13

its statutory argument because a different statute uses

14

similar words, but we don't know if it was with the same

15

intent.

16

Smiley talks about a sitting legislature and

asks whether its exercise of map­drawing power is a

legislative exercise or, say, more like an impeachment

19

exercise.

where you have people outside that building making the

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Let me start with the definition of

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"legislature."

2

quotes from the framers.

3

the blue brief.

4

the framers meant by the legislature when they were

5

talking broadly about political theory or the Swiss

6

canton of Zug.

7

about assigning particular authorities in the

8

Constitution to particular components of the State

9

government.

Obviously, we can point to our favorite
They're at 27 and 34 and 35 of

The critical thing, though, is not what

What matters is when they were talking

And in that context, as a number of you

10

have pointed out, there is no doubt, every time they

11

assigned an authority to the State legislature, they

12

were assigning the authority to the representative body

13

of the people.

14

Now, that takes us to the Smiley case.

And

15

if the definition of "legislature" in the Smiley case is

16

what this case turns on, then with all due respect to my

17

friends on the other side, we win.

18

specifically talked, as Justice Breyer alluded to, the

19

body question, and then it defined "the body."

20

it said is, quote ­­ I'm quoting from Smiley, not Yates

21

or anything else; I'm quoting from Smiley ­­ "The term

22

was not one of uncertain meaning when incorporated into

23

the Constitution.

24

means for purposes of interpretation.

25

then the representative body which made the laws of the

Because Smiley

And what

What it meant when adopted, it still

54

people."
JUSTICE BREYER:

That's true.

But I see ­­

3

Smiley doesn't help him, I don't think, but I think it

4

helps you still less, because that was the question in

5

the case.

6

those people in the ­­ the bricks over there that are

7

making this law.

8

legislating when they're doing it?

9

nobody denied they were the legislative power.

10

Everybody assumed, nobody denied, that it's

But the question is:

Are they

So they were ­­
Here, we

have a different question.

11

MR. CLEMENT:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

With respect to ­­
And that is:

Is this the

13

legislative power when you can proceed by referendum?

14

And the reason I say Smiley might help is simply because

15

it says be a little bit flexible about that.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it says a little bit

17

flexible about the lawmaking authority of the State

18

legislature.

19

key that allows you to make laws without sthe process of

20

the governor being involved at all.

21

is very helpful because not only does it answer the body

22

question, but the parties disputed this and the ­­ and

23

the other side in Smiley said, oh, we win this case

24

because legislature means the lawmaking authority.

25

the other side said, no, it means the body.

So don't think you've been given some new

55
Alderson Reporting Company

I do think Smiley

And

And this

Official

1

Court said, you're right, it means the body, but

2

critically, it's a lawmaking function.

3

subject to the gubernatorial veto.

4

have been flabbergasted to find out that the

5

legislature, which they just defined as the

6

representative body of the people, could be cut out

7

entirely.

8

Let me give you ­­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Therefore, it's

I think they would

But I would think, Mr.

10

Clement, that the overriding principle of Smiley and

11

Hildebrant and Hawke is that when it comes to this

12

particular provision, and this particular provision as

13

compared to the Seventeenth Amendment, which is the

14

comparison and the contrast that Hawke sets up, when it

15

comes to this particular provision, we need to show a

16

lot of respect to the State's own decisions about how

17

legislative power ought to be exercised.

18

to me the overriding principle of the three cases.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

And that seems

I think what you have to show

20

is respect for the way that the State says the State

21

legislature can go about lawmaking.

22

completely different to say it's okay to cut the State

23

legislature out of the process entirely.

24
25

But it is

Let me avert very briefly to the 1911 Act,
which, of course, is since repealed.

56
Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

Official

1

questions show that the actual statute that's now on the

2

books has nothing to do with this case.

3

of my friends on the other side relying on the

4

legislation ­­ the legislative history of the 1911 Act

5

is, the whole point of the legislative history in 1911

6

is people in 1911 could read.

7

then said you're going to have the Federal default rule

8

kick in until the State legislature redistricts.

9

realized in 1911 that the State legislature meant the

But the irony

The statute on the books

They

10

State legislature, so they better change that law if

11

they wanted to allow the referendum process.

12

So the 1911 legislative history ­­ not that

13

I think you should particularly spend a lot of time with

14

it, but it actually cuts against them on the

15

constitutional issue.

16

fundamental difference between the legislature and the

17

people.

18

weren't, then the framers could have stopped the

19

Election Clause at ­­ in each State.

20

had to say, "by the legislatures thereof."

It shows that there is a

And as the Chief Justice pointed out, if there

Now, the other side ­­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They wouldn't have

But, of course, you can turn

23

that around and say what that provision shows is really

24

exactly what I just said, is that Congress was also on

25

board with this idea that the Court had, that when you

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

look at that clause, the Elections Clause, that a lot of

2

respect, a lot of deference, has to be given to the

3

State's own definition.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

And if I may respond, Justice

5

Kagan.

6

State legislature does.

7

the State by the rule that you have a gubernatorial

8

veto, override by referendum, something has to sit in

9

committee for 30 days, then the restrictions on the

And if that's constrained in

12

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
