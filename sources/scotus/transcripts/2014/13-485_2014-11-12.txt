Mr. Brockman.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. BROCKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BROCKMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

A State's broad power to impose a personal

12

net income tax on its own residents is grounded in the

13

special benefits that a State affords to its own

14

residents particularly because they are residents.

15

is, things like public schools, social services

16

programs, medical assistance services, and of course the

17

right to vote in the process that determines both the

18

level of those benefits and the level of taxes that are

19

paid in return for them.

20

That

There is no reason that a State should have

21

to subordinate this power, this taxing power, just

22

because another State, exercising an equally legitimate

23

taxing power, but on a very distinct ground, is taxing a

24

portion of that income merely because it was earned

25

within that State's borders.

MR. BROCKMAN:

MR. BROCKMAN:

Because all residents are

7

treated the same.

8

regardless of where it is earned.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They are taxed on their entire income

Well, but as ­­ as

10

your friends on the other side point out in their

11

example at pages 22 to 23 of their brief, if you do the

12

internal consistency test, it ends up not being equal.

13

What it ends up is imposing a special tax ­­ they even

14

call it special, right, the special nonresident's tax ­­

15

on those who live in one State and work in the other,

16

that people who live in the State and work in the State

17

do not have to pay.

I might start with Jefferson

20

where only one claim ­­ State can claim to be taxing a

21

value on the specific basis it is taxing it on, but many

22

other States can be taxing it on a different basis.

talking about.

that I would like you specifically ­­ and you are

position is that the residents ­­ the domicile can tax

give a credit because somebody else is also taxing it?

Do you stop having the power to tax worldwide income

And I think everybody agrees

The question is:

MR. BROCKMAN:

Does the domicile have to

I think that is the question,

21

Your Honor:

22

taxation of a portion of that income, but on a very

23

distinct ground, a territorial ground?

24

argument that State would make is:

6

We think you live here, and the Wynnes

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I was just

7

going to say it's not a question of yielding.

8

you test under our precedents whether one State has to

9

yield or not is to say, well, let's suppose each State

The way

10

does exactly the same thing, neither one is yielding.

11

And as indicated earlier, the example in the

12

Respondents' brief is that if each State did what we're

13

talking about, people who work in one State and live in

14

another would pay higher taxes overall than people who

15

live within one State and work in the same State.

16

that sounds to me like a tariff.

17

MR. BROCKMAN:

And

Well, perhaps this is another

18

way to address the internal consistency analysis and

19

demonstrate why we think it doesn't do very much good

20

analytic work here.

21

one of this Court's opinions in Curry, "Income may be

22

taxed both by the state where it is earned and by the

23

state of the recipient's domicile," points internal

24

consistency, that's it.

25

there ­­ there's a credit or not, that's the issue here,

If you take just a single sentence in

If you add the feature that

11
Alderson Reporting Company

1

and if, as in Chickasaw Nation that the offering of that

2

credit is understood correctly as an independent policy

3

decision that states make and is not of constitutional

4

magnitude, is not done as a matter of constitutional

5

compulsion, then the internal consistency problem

6

remains.

7

We think the internal consistency test works

8

better, though not perfectly, when we're talking about

9

two states taxing on the same basis.

Because there, it

10

may detect instances where one state is overreaching

11

jurisdictionally, exercising a power that it does not

12

lawfully have.

13

Maryland lacks this power, they acknowledge it.

14

and they acknowledge it as an attribute of Maryland's

sovereignty.

So what we're left with is an argument of

the discrimination here is in the supposed

malapportionment itself.

18

question of apportionment, fair apportionment, I think

19

is common to both the due process and Commerce Clause

20

jurisprudence of this Court, and I think Maryland's tax

21

survives that scrutiny under both ­­

And that question, the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about ­­ we're

dealing with an individual because it's a Chapter S

I think Maryland, like all

13
Alderson Reporting Company

states, uses an apportionment formula for both domestic

and foreign corporations.

MR. BROCKMAN:

We don't believe this case

4

implicates any question of how corporations would be

taxed.

6

a basis for the broad taxing power and the benefits that

7

one receives as residents is unique to individuals, and

8

it's always been articulated in cases involving

9

individuals, so we're talking about personal income

10
11

The residence principle that we're relying on as

taxes here.

And it might very well ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I suppose you could

12

argue that some states are very ­­ have very good

13

corporation laws and that's why corporations are

14

domiciled there.

understood.

20

fact of domiciliary status, whatever ­­ however that's

equally.

from $180 ­­ from $225 to $180,000 annually, and that

5

it's not based on income, it's based on a very complex

6

measure of the worth of the entire enterprise.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can we go back to the

8

Chief's initial question.

9

would you fail the internal consistency test?

If we applied Complete Auto,
And if

10

you fail it, why shouldn't we apply that test here?

11

Would you ­­ if we applied it, would you fail it?

12

MR. BROCKMAN:

I don't believe we would

13

because I think the proper construction of that test in

14

this situation asks about the internal consistency of

15

the rationale that Maryland is advancing, that is, are

16

we being consistent in our structure ­­ in structuring

17

our tax so that it reaches residents on their entire

18

income regardless of whether it's earned.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I must say I am confused

20

about what this case involved.

21

surprising, that it involves both the Commerce Clause

22

and any other constitutional prohibition.

23

Whereas your opponents, the question they say is

presented is whether a state tax that exposes interstate

commerce to double taxation is saved from invalidation

justified on the basis of the taxpayer's domicile as the

4

Maryland county income tax is.

5

In Gwin and Greyhound, the Court didn't even

6

address any argument that the tax was based on domicile.

7

And in J.D. Adams, although the highest court in Indiana

8

had ­­ believed that the tax was justified on the basis

9

of domicile, this Court looked at the structure of the

10

tax and concluded that it wasn't ­­ that that

residency, but not income.

15

a tax on sleeping, measured by the number of pairs of

17

you can call it residency, but if it's still using

18

income as its basis as opposed to property values or

19

whatever else these residency taxes are based on, then

20

why isn't it a tax on income?

Let me be as clear as I can,

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I mean, that is the

question, isn't it?
MR. FEIGIN:

Yes, I think that is part of

the analysis of the question.
But if every State enacted an income tax

11

that looked exactly like Maryland's county income tax,

12

that applies one uniform rate no matter where income is

13

earned, every U.S. citizen would pay income tax at the

14

exact same rate no matter where they earned their

15

income.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Except if they also

17

imposed the special nonresident tax, and that changes

18

the whole scenario.

19

MR. FEIGIN:

20

In addition to what I said to Justice Kagan

21

about that earlier, let me add a further thought, that

22

if you really thought there was a problem with the

23

interaction of resident and nonresident taxes then I

24

think it would probably be much more logical to locate

25

the problem in the nonresident tax rather than the

That's right, Your Honor.

20
Alderson Reporting Company

2

resident tax, for three reasons.
First, the nonresident tax is the only one

3

that's triggered by economic activity that crosses State

4

lines.

5

business is done in State or out of State.

Maryland's county income tax applies whether the

6

Second, any differential incentives that a

7

taxpayer might have to do business in one State versus

8

another aren't arising from the county income tax, which

9

applies evenly, but instead from the differential tax

10

rates that various other States which their nonresidents

11

might have.

12

Idaho a 5 percent rate, and Iowa an 8 percent rate.

13

So Illinois might impose a 3 percent rate,

And the third thing is that the resident tax

14

is the only one that the taxpayers actually have some

15

political power to get in there and to influence.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In your answer that you

17

gave to my ­­ the hypothetical of 100 percent, that

18

would be a burden on 100 percent of interstate commerce,

19

because a resident who did not go into interstate

20

commerce would pay less, so there is a burden.

21

you're saying is, well, if there's going to be a burden,

22

it could be a great big one.

23

MR. FEIGIN:

All

So, Your Honor, there is ­­ in

24

some cases, a Maryland resident will be taxed more on

commerce that they conduct outside of Maryland then

And I think for the reasons I was just

5

explaining to the Chief Justice, one could file a

6

perhaps more persuasive brief challenging the

nonresident tax which the Maryland taxpayers exposed and

that's not a reason for invalidating the uniform

The Maryland courts recognize the

Whether

But the reason I think that nonresident

22

taxes can peacefully coexist with resident taxes is that

23

although they are both income taxes, they are on

24

distinct jurisdictional rationales, and when two taxes

25

are imposed on the same value based on distinct

24
Alderson Reporting Company

1

jurisdictional rationales, it's not impermissible double

2

taxation under the Commerce Clause, and let me give an

3

example.

4

If an operation manufactures all of its

5

widgets in State A and sells them all in State B, it's

6

clear under this Court's decisions in McGoldrick v.

7

Berwind­White Coal Mining Company and Armco v. Hardesty

8

that State A can impose a manufacturing tax that is

9

measured by the value of the revenue of the sales even

10

though the sales occur in State B.

11

impose a gross receipts tax on the sales that occur in

12

State B which is paid by the seller, the mining company

13

or the widget manufacturer in my example, which is also

14

taxed on that same value, the taxes that occur in State

15

B.

And State B can

16

The reason that's permissible is because

17

they're distinct jurisdictional rationales, which is

18

what we have here.

19

and the other is tax based on doing business in the

State.

21

One is a tax based on the residency

Previous apportionment cases this Court has

then, you know, maybe that tax could survive under the

8

gross receipts tax is understood, at least at that time,
