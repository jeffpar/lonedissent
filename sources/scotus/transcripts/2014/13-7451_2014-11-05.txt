ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. BADALAMENTI
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. BADALAMENTI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The natural, sensible and contextual reading

12

of Section 1519 is that the phrase "record document or

13

tangible object" is confined to records, documents and

14

devices designed to preserve information, the very

15

matters involved in the Enron debacle.

16

expansive Federal nexus of this statute, which is the

17

intent to influence the proper administration of any

18

matter within the jurisdiction of the United States, it

19

is implausible that Congress would have passed sub

20

silentio, an all­encompassing obstruction statute buried

21

within the altering documents provision of the

22

Sarbanes­Oxley Act.

Given the

23

A strong textual indicator that Section 1519

24

is confined to record­related offenses is the inclusion

25

of the unique term "makes false entry in," which

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress only uses in record­related statutes.

2

canons of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis confirm

3

that tangible object is related to the common thread

4

between record and document which are information

5

devices ­­ information mediums.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

Why should ­­ why should

7

the expression "tangible object," which stands alone,

8

it's not falsifying documents, why should the word

9

"object" in 1519 be treated differently than the word

10
11

"other object" in 1512 ­­ 1512(c)?
MR. BADALAMENTI:

Justice Ginsburg, in

12

Section 1519 ­­ it was passed at the same time as

13

1512(c) as part of the Sarbanes­Oxley Act.

14

Court held in Russello, when Congress includes different

15

terms in different statutes passed in the same act, it

16

is intended to mean something different.

17

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And as this

So you think there's a

difference between "tangible object" and "other object"?
MR. BADALAMENTI:

Yes, there is.

The first

20

reason is that the inclusion of "makes false entry in"

21

indicates that the phrase "record document and tangible

22

objects" refers to recordkeeping.

23

that ­­ a common sense standpoint ­­ is that records can

24

only be maintained on tangible mediums.

MR. BADALAMENTI:

No, the government's test

are definitions providing meaning to all of them.

11

only in 1512(c)(1), but there are, you know, I think

12

five times in 1512 from a prior enactment this same kind

13

of phrase is used, which is "record document and other

14

object."

15

as it exists many times in 1512 differently from this

16

phrase in 1519 because of the difference between

17

tangible object and other object.

why you're treating the two differently.

So I guess I just don't understand

MR. BADALAMENTI:

It is, to answer your

question, they're being treated differently not simply

7

because of the inclusion of the word "tangible," but

8

because of the other words surrounding "tangible

object," like the unique phrase "makes faltering entry

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But just because Congress

MR. BADALAMENTI:

Although this Court has

We have a limited subject

10

you have a tremendously broad nexus to any matter within

12

unlike traditional classic statutes.

13

that Congress wanted to narrow the subject matter of

this particular statute when you're dealing with such a

15

broad nexus to any Federal matter.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's

It makes sense

But I would think ­­ I'm

17

sorry.

18

the fact that this is about any matter within the

19

jurisdiction of any agency in the United States shows

20

that it's really not just about corporate fraud, that

21

Congress had a broader set of things in mind.

22

would think that that's ­­ that's quite the opposite,

23

that everything about this statute, the "any matter,"

24

the "any record," suggests breadth.

25

I would think that that cuts against you, that

4

Penalties For Altering Documents."

5

as another contextual indicator that this is intended to

13

apply to record­related matters.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Then how do you ­­ how do

15

you respond to the illustration that the government gave

16

in its brief?

17

you can be indicted under 1519 if you destroy a letter

18

that the victim that you have murdered has sent you, but

19

you can't be indicted under 1519 if you destroy the

20

murder weapon?

21

That is, what sense does it make to say

MR. BADALAMENTI:

Congress did not intend

22

1519 to be applied in that situation.

the question, Justice Ginsburg, it is remarkable that

24

the government would use 1519 in a murder situation.

8

given what you've just said, of the best way to narrow

10

MR. BADALAMENTI:

The best way to narrow

11

this statute, Justice Breyer, is to interpret "tangible

12

object" in the company it keeps, and that is a device

13

that is designed to preserve information such that if

14

that device is destroyed, the information contained on

15

that device is destroyed.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

You still have the problem

17

of the language of the statute covering the destruction

18

of a document such as an EPA questionnaire that comes to

19

the door asking about recycling, where you know that the

20

EPA would like to have that back to help them do their

21

official work of finding out how the program works.

22

You, believing that that's their business, not yours,

But my problem, of course,

is reading the statute and taking your argument in the

context that you mean it, which is we must look for a

way to narrow this statute, which at first blush seems

more than trying to find out information.

vagueness, but not for any reason you have yet told us.

14

problem, that it has never been argued in this case?

In this case that was Section 1519.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Martinez, can we go

back to what we started with ­­ with what Justice Breyer

25

started with?

If I understood your brief right, up

Alderson Reporting Company

1

until 1519, the general obstruction statute, 1503,

2

applied only to the destruction of evidence in a

3

judicial proceeding if you got someone else to destroy

4

it.

5

MR. MARTINEZ:

1503 applied only to pending

6

judicial proceedings.

7

Section 1512(b)(2) that, as ­­ as the Court considered

8

and addressed in the Arthur Andersen prosecution, 1512

9

(b)(2) did not prohibit

10

There was a different provision,

single act or destruction.

You had to persuade someone else.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Okay.

So you needed

12

something to punish people who destroyed evidence and ­­

13

but I see two provisions, 1519 and 1512.

14

superfluous?

MR. MARTINEZ:

Are they

those provisions is to ­­ is to understand the fact

that, one, they are super ­­ they are redundant largely,

19

It's a very reasonable question to ask.

20

is, these were rival ­­ essentially rival provisions,

21

they were drafted by different people at different times

22

and they both ended up in the statute by the way that

I mean, you know, that explains how it

happens.

It doesn't explain how it makes any sense.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, Your Honor, I think to

4

address the ­­ the textual component of the superfluous

5

nature of those two provisions, I think it's unambiguous

6

that they are superfluous, and I think Petitioner would

7

agree with us that they're superfluous with respect to

8

records and documents.

9

was not intending to avoid surplusage.

So we know here that Congress
The only

10

question is whether they also ­­ they ­­ they thought it

12

which is either "other objects" or "tangible objects."

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, not only that,

14

1519 ­­ 1512 only applies for use in an official

15

proceeding; isn't ­­ isn't that right?

16

MR. MARTINEZ:

about how you deal with investigations and whether

prohibit the destruction of fish, and yet that's the

23

point on which we all agree here today.

24
25

I'd like to say a few words about the
various textual arguments that ­­ that Petitioner has

41
Alderson Reporting Company

1

put forward, the nouns, the verbs and the headings.

2

First of all, with respect to ­­ with respect to the

3

nouns, I think the historical evidence that we've put

4

forward, I think, show conclusively that the term

5

"record," "document," and "tangible things" is very,

6

very similar to the standard formulation that

7

essentially everyone has used to cover all physical

8

evidence in the obstruction of justice context for over

9

five decades.

10
11

Secondly, 1512(c)(1) confirms that the ­­
the ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Martinez, where are those other provisions?

14

16

other Federal statutes?

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. MARTINEZ:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In

Well, see, the

12

reason ­­ I mean, maybe that makes a difference if you

have records, documents, and then a tangible object

suggests that the tangible nature of it is what's

15

significant, which suggests that it may be one of the ­­

18

statutes that you were citing.

19

And that's a point that's not present in the

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think ­­ I think it's true

20

that the term "tangible" is different.

21

way to understand the term "tangible" is the way in

22

which Congress and ­­ and the rules always use the term

23

"tangible" in connection with things or objects, which

24

is as a way to refer to all types of ­­ of objects, all

types of evidence.

I think that the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You, in your brief, point

3

to the Model Penal Code as the model for 1519.

4

Model Penal Code describes a misdemeanor, and this is a

5

20­year felony.

6

But the

That seems kind of a mismatch.

MR. MARTINEZ:

You know, if ­­ the tradition

7

of ­­ of the degree of penalty to attach to this offense

8

has changed over time.

9

Penal Code did identify this as a misdemeanor.

As you point out, the Model
The

10

Brown Commission, which built on the Model Penal Code,

11

treated it as a misdemeanor or as a felony, depending on

12

the severity of the underlying offense.

13

When Congress sat down in the '70s and '80s

14

and was trying to incorporate, essentially, that

15

provision into Federal law unsuccessfully, over a dozen

16

times it treated it as a felony.

17

Congress in Sarbanes­Oxley Act in both 1512(c)(1) and in

18

1519 also treated it as a felony with a 20­year penalty.

19

And ­­ and with respect to that penalty, again, I think

20

it's important to emphasize that the text that's at

21

issue here, any tangible object, that was fixed and that

22

was drafted ­­ it was in the bill that was introduced by

23

Senator Leahy at the time when it was only a 5­year

24

penalty.

25

Congress tinkered with that penalty, it meant to kind

And then, or course,

And there's no reason to think that when

Alderson Reporting Company

of, by implication, shrink the scope of tangible objects

2

that's at issue here.

3

And I think just to emphasize the ­­ the

4

textual point, it's ­­ it's a very unusual and I think

5

it's ­­ it's highly implausible to believe that Congress

6

chose this broad and expansive phrase, "any tangible

7

object," when really what it really wanted to do was

8

refer only to a very narrow and specific category of

9

information storage devices.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't that

of the applications of the statute.

Finally, Your Honor, with respect to the

headings, a couple points.

13

in this case as in ­­ as in the Lawson case that this

14

8

of concerns that courts and juries and judges are going

to take into consideration when they're dealing with any

of these crimes.

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think that you write a very

narrow decision that says this case is about the meaning

of the term "any tangible object."

then ­­ and if the arguments are made, then I think

It's on pages 25 and 26, as well as

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but it wasn't raised

We just
