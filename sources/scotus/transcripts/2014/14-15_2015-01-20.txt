ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WITHROE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Respondents have no rights under

12

Section (30)(A), and so they have no privately

13

enforceable right of action to enforce that statute

14

under Section 1983 or under an implied right of action.

15

The Supremacy Clause does not provide an alternative

16

freestanding right of action to enforce Section (30)(A),

17

either.

18

where this Court has invalidated State or local law

19

under the Supremacy Clause.

20

preemption case at all; it is an action to enforce the

21

statute and it is foreclosed by Sandoval, Gonzaga

22

University, and Astra.

23

This case is distinguishable from the cases

In fact, this is not a

Preemption solves the problem of two

24

separate sovereigns regulating independently in the same

25

territory.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But

Could you tell me, if

5

this is unlike those other cases where we've invoked the

6

Supremacy Clause, what's the basis for those cases?

7

MR. WITHROE:

The ­­ the basis for those

8

cases is that there, there would have been a Federal law

9

that allowed plaintiff's conduct, and then State law

10

that interfered with that conduct that it was allowed by

11

Federal law, and thus, the Supremacy Clause resolved

12

the ­­ the conflict and provided ­­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

understand your answer.

15

MR. WITHROE:

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not sure I

Okay.
That's the claim here,

17

that there's a Federal law that is contrary to the State

18

law, and I don't know why you can't look at this as an

19

enforcement action.

20

The State law won't permit these individuals

21

to charge an amount greater than they're willing to pay.

22

So if these doctors or providers wanted to charge more,

23

they would be in violation of State law and would have

24

an enforcement action against them.

25

don't ­­ I don't actually see this enforcement ­­ this

So, I mean, I

4

scheme, that there would not arise a situation where

5

providers are charging patients more than the State

6

allows.

7

with respect to this waiver program, is that the

8

providers provide the service to the beneficiary, the

9

providers then bill the State, and the State reimburses

I have two responses to that,
The first is that under Idaho's

The way that it works in Idaho, particularly

10

them.

11

regulations, the providers come into the program and

12

agree to take as payment in full the amount ­­ the

13

lesser of the amount of their customary charges or the

14

State's set rates.

15

where we ­­

16

self­help and charging more than the ­­ than the rates

17

allow.

18

And both under Federal regulations and State

And so we would not have a situation

they would be charging ­­ resorting to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, they could, and

19

then you would come in and say, you violated Federal and

20

State regulation.

But you ­­

MR. WITHROE:

You wouldn't pay it.
That ­­ that's correct, Your

Honor.

fact, send us bills all the time with their customary

25

charge, and ­­ and we pay them the State rate.

We ­­ we wouldn't pay it.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, but what if they just

asked the ­­ the patient herself to ­­ to pay a

4

supplemental rate?

5

you would say, you know, you can't do that.

6

And then you would have come in and

MR. WITHROE:

And that would be balance

7

billing, which is also not allowed under State or

8

Federal law.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, it's not allowed.

10

That's right.

11

enforcement action against such a supplemental bill.

12

But that's why you would bring an

MR. WITHROE:

And their defense would not be

13

­­ they wouldn't have a valid defense that our rates are

14

too low in violation of the Medicaid Act, because they

15

don't have a right to a specific rate or a process or

16

anything else under Section (30)(A), and so they

17

couldn't raise if we ­­ if, under that situation, we

18

were to go after them for violating the rule.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That would be a merits

20

question.

21

They would say, the rates are too low; the rates violate

22

Federal law; we're entitled to a higher rate.

23

I mean, they would make that exact claim.

MR. WITHROE:

And ­­ and that ­­ that might

24

go to the ­­ to the merits there.

25

is that you look at the statute first, and the statute

6
Alderson Reporting Company

But what we would say

Official

1

doesn't entitle them to anything.

2

like in ­­ in determining whether a plaintiff has a

3

Section 1983 right or whether a plaintiff has standing,

4

for example, you kind of have to wade into the merits

5

just a little bit, but they wouldn't have that defense,

6

because the ­­

And that, sort of

contention that those ­­ all of those cases fit into

And is it your

10

this mold of an affirmative ­­ anticipatory affirmative

11

defense or regulation of primary conduct?

12

MR. WITHROE:

Yes, Your Honor.

Some of them

13

fall into ­­ actually, some of them fall into the

14

category of Section 1983 rights having been ­­ having

15

been raised, if ­­ if we look at the ­­ the lower court

opinions.

But the rest of them are largely explainable

in one of two ways.

present that situation where you have one sovereign

20

regulating in territory that it is not supposed to be

21

regulating in, and ­­ and so that ­­ that law is deemed

22

invalid.

that the issue of whether there was a pre­exemption

cause of action under the Supremacy Clause or some other

source wasn't raised.

The first way is that they do

So

Pay me.

Now, can't he say that?

And now ­­ in

12

California, you could say, well, 80 is too high, you'd

13

have to have some way of figuring out what's the right

14

amount, but everybody would say that if it's true that

15

60 isn't enough to enlist, then the State statute which

16

says 60 is preempted by the Federal.

17

Now, that isn't trying to enforce it.

What

18

you're trying to do is enforce your claim to get some

19

money for services rendered.

20

MR. WITHROE:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. WITHROE:

Can they not do that?

They can't do that.
Why not?
Because they don't have a

23

right under Section 30(A).

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

to write under 30(A).

No, I'm not saying we don't
There is a plan in California,

those words say that a doctor who provides services

under this plan gets paid.

Now, I ­­ I must be wrong so ­­ because this

has been the second time we heard this case, and I

17

didn't understand why it was different than that the

I'm entitled to this rate ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. WITHROE:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. WITHROE:

­­ under this Federal statute.
Yes.
And that looks to me an awful

4

lot like the claims that you ­­ that the Court

5

entertained in Gonzaga and those kinds of things.

6

there, the Court said there must be a right, and because

7

Section 30(A) confers no rights on this ­­ this doctor,

8

this doctor cannot make the preemption claim.

9

And

And then the second part of that is that in

10

that sense, the rates do not regulate the doctor's

11

conduct in a way that is protected by Federal law.

12

that may sound confusing, and so let me try to restate

13

it.

14

And

In the preemption cases in the appendix in

15

the red brief, we have all of these cases where the

16

Federal government has a statute and the State

17

government has another statute and that Federal statute

18

displaces the State from being able to regulate, whereas

19

in this case, Medicaid, Section 30(A) is part of a

20

cooperative program where the State, rather than being

21

displaced from the arena of regulation, is invited in

22

and participates as a cooperative partner and so we

23

don't have that two separate sovereigns regulating

24

independently in overlapping territory.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you think , Mr.

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Withroe ­­ and this is true of some significant parts of

2

your brief, you might have an argument on the merits

3

that there shouldn't be preemption here, that the nature

4

of 30(A) is that the Federal law doesn't preempt the

5

State law.

6

not a question about whether somebody can come into

7

court and make that claim and tee it up for a court to

8

decide whether there's been preemption in the case.

9

But that's an argument on the merits; it's

MR. WITHROE:

Sure.

And I can understand

10

that, and I have a response to that.

11

just like in the 1983 cases and just like in cases where

12

standing is at issue, the examination ­­ when the claim

13

is brought under the Supremacy Clause, the examination

14

first must be to the statute.

15

Does the statute allow the plaintiff to engage in this

16

conduct that she says is being interfered with by the

17

State?

18
19
20

And that is, that

What does the statute do?

You make that threshold inquiry by looking
at the statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Then what

21

you're arguing is that unless there's a 1983 claim,

22

there's no cause ­­ unless there's a private cause of

23

action, there could never be a Supremacy Clause claim.

24
25

MR. WITHROE:

Not necessarily.

There might

be a ­­ a preemption claim outside of the Section 1983

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

context if that State ­­ or if that Federal law

2

regulates the plaintiff in a way that the State law

3

interferes with.

4

So, for instance, the dissent in Golden

5

State hypothesized just this situation where you had

6

a ­­ a locality that was ­­ that was regulating

7

employment stuff, and then you had the NLRA, and the

8

employer sought a case under 1983.

9

Golden State explained that there may, in certain

The dissent in

10

circumstances, be cases where the plaintiff doesn't have

11

a 1983 right; in other words, the statute at issue does

12

not confer upon her an actual enforceable right, but

13

that may be a case that may present a case of the wrong

14

sovereign regulating her.

15

second situation that we contemplate might give rise to

16

a ­­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But why doesn't that ­­ I

you should straighten out what is the rate.

We did have

21

the 2006 rate and that was approved by CMS.

Did CMS

22

approve the 2009 rate?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARL J. WITHROE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. WITHROE:

21

I want to go to a couple of points.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
If ­­

22

if the Court reads the district court opinion and the

23

court of appeal's opinion, nowhere in either of those

24

opinions is there a discussion about whether the State

25

complied with this 2009 waiver amendment methodology or

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

whether it didn't.
That ­­ this case has never been about that.

3

As pleaded, litigated and as it comes to this Court,

4

this case has been about whether our rates violated the

5

Ninth Circuit's requirements that rates be based on

6

provider costs and bear some reasonable relationship to

7

provider costs.

8

litigated.

9

That's how this case was pleaded and

With that out of way, there's a couple other

10

points I'd like to get to.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The ­­ the remedy of ­­
Sorry, Mr. Withroe, but I

12

just ­­ when you say that, I mean, my understanding of

13

the district court's opinion was that it was

14

specifically ­­ it wasn't sort of doing this on its own

15

in deciding what would be efficient by its lights.

16

it was entirely based on was the State's own cost

17

studies and it was just saying that the State had

18

already decided this and because the State had already

19

decided that this was necessary in order to meet the

20

standard, that the State had to comply with its own

21

views.

22

MR. WITHROE:

We did not ever say that these

23

rates were necessary to bring us to compliance with

Section (30)(A).

So are you agreeing with

him that you didn't follow the procedures and methods

7

MR. WITHROE:

No, I don't agree with that.

8

We ­­ we followed the methods and procedures that had

been in place.

And methods and procedures can be

20

And so there's a couple other points that I

21

want to get to in the limited time that I've got.

22

Going back to Justice Breyer's example

17

MR. WITHROE:

No, they would not have a

18

right of action, we would have the same result.

19

reason for that is that Congress has set up a system

20

where the secretary gets to administer the statute and

21

monitor the plan for compliance, conduct periodic audits

22

and then make a determination about whether we are in
