ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. McALLISTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Kansas seeks to ensure that Nebraska has

12

effective incentives to comply with its compact

13

obligations every year, including the years when water

14

is scarce.

15

Court to take two measures:

16

amount of disgorgement for Nebraska's massive gain from

17

its compact violation; and second, decline to rewrite

18

the detailed and complicated settlement agreement that

19

the parties reached in 2002, an agreement that is full

20

of compromises and concessions on all sides.

To achieve that goal, Kansas asked this
First, award a significant

21

Ultimately, Kansas wants to receive the

22

water to which it is entitled year in and year out,

23

including especially when water is scarce.

24

to achieve that is to impose significant disgorgement

25

for Nebraska's massive gain and leave any changes to the

that has been created under the compact, the RRCA.

5

I'd

Nebraska and the master suggest that

6

the Court should rewrite the way we calculate Nebraska's

7

consumption of imported water supply, but Kansas

8

disagrees that that's appropriate here for several

9

reasons.

10

First of all, that agreement itself was a

11

complex set of concessions and compromises.

12

is, at best, an estimation of what's going on in the

13

basin.

14

much imported water comes over from the Platte or how

15

much actually gets consumed.

16

the very phenomenon that the master and Nebraska focus

17

on.

The model

22

23

Still no authority to revise the formula?

What if it were

What if the formula resulted in Kansas getting

3

That's what justifies the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And I thought it was ­­

4

it was agreed that the compact itself doesn't govern

5

imported water, which this procedure covers.

6

not within the compact itself, then how can it stand?

7

MR. McALLISTER:

So if it's

Well, Your Honor, it's ­­

it's not as black or white as the master said.

It never actually uses the words "imported water."

12

the parties' goal to try to exclude the imported water

13

from the calculation, but we did that very deliberately

14

with the imported water supply credit, which is very

15

substantial and which Nebraska gets.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

And it's certainly

But I thought that ­­

17

that the parties were not aware of the error that proved

18

beneficial to Kansas.

19

compromises, tradeoffs, but in this particular result,

20

the parties were not aware that the accounting

21

procedures would include this imported water.

22

So you say that there were many

Well, I disagree with that

statement, Your Honor.

what happens, in our view, is Nebraska is saying, well,

now we think we've come up with a better way to more

10

modeling techniques that may be available.

11

a mechanism for making those changes and it's through

12

the RRCA process.

they've got a better way to do it now.

MR. McALLISTER:

disagree that there ­­
JUSTICE BREYER:

I know.

I don't

9

river is dry, as it sometimes is, and there's no water

10

in there, that Nebraska ­­ that they ­­ they don't ­­

11

they use only imported water, which they should have

12

every right to take all of it if they wanted to.

13

nonetheless, due to a mistake in the model, it counts it

14

as if they were taking all the Republican River water.

15

And nobody wanted that.

16

And that's what the master says and so they made a

17

mistake about how the model worked.

18

suggest we do about the mistake?

That would be totally unfair.

MR. McALLISTER:

suggests.

Kansas doesn't believe that's present.

master's solution, the 5­run solution, is all he is

concerned about is the imported water supply.

only one piece of this.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think your objection is

that what the parties really intended was to adopt this

latitude for reforming the contract, so that the earlier

contract an equitable character and makes it easier to

If that 5­run proposal had

three or four things that might be different.

25

Obviously, it's hypothetical, but one thing that the

Alderson Reporting Company

5­run solution does is it does take care of the imported

2

water issue, but it actually increases the problem with

3

the unaccounted­for depletions from groundwater pumping,

4

which is what the whole prior round of litigation was

5

about, was that those count under the compact, too.

6

so the master's solution may solve, if you will, one

7

problem, the problem that Nebraska sees, it exacerbates

8

another problem.

9

that.

And

So we'd certainly want to talk about

closer what we call the virgin water supply metric, but

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANN O'CONNELL ON BEHALF

8

OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

11

MS. O'CONNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
There are two primary points that the United

12

States would like to make.

13

disgorgement be an available remedy for breach of an

14

interstate water compact.

15

between private parties, interstate water compacts are

16

laws of the United States that apportion a scarce

resource among sovereigns.

flows down the river, not just money, and the

19

availability of a disgorgement remedy will help to

20

stabilize compacts and ensure that States are working

21

vigorously to meet their compact obligations.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

First, it is important that

Unlike a regular contract

It is important that water

Well, you could say the

23

same about contracts.

that disgorgement is not a remedy for contracts, right?

25

I mean, no ­­ nobody is saying

MS. O'CONNELL:

That's right.

24
Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The problem is what should

2

be the conditions under which disgorgement is imposed.

3

Does it require an intentional violation or not?

That's ­­ that's all the debate is about here.

of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment ­­ that's the

And although Section 39 of the Restatement

10

requires a deliberate breach, and the master did find

11

here that this was not deliberate, we ­­ we're drawn to

12

that provision because the Court has said repeatedly a

13

compact is like a contract.

19

then the remedy for a conscious wrongdoer ­­ and I think

20

the master's finding or conclusion about Nebraska's

intent here is that of a conscious wrongdoer, that they

22

knowingly exposed Kansas to a risk of a breach.

And if you interfere with another

Do you have a lot of cases?

Well ­­
Are there cases that ­­

that have established that rule?
MS. O'CONNELL:

In Texas v. New Mexico,

7

the Court, when it was talking about why awarding money

8

damages is not ­­ shouldn't be a concern that States

9

will just continue to violate compacts as long as they

10

can send money down the river, the Court said, we don't

11

really need to worry about that because there's always

12

the possibility of ordering specific performance plus

13

whatever additional penalty might be warranted for a

14

deliberate breach.

15

And even ­­ I mean, the Court wasn't saying

16

in that case it has to be deliberate or setting forth a

17

legal standard, but I think this Court has ­­ has

18

indicated that disgorgement may be appropriate when you

19

have an intentional breach or something.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If disgorgement is

that you should be looking at.

amount in a circumstance like this?

$5.5 million, which is a disgorgement of part of

MR. COOKSON:

Because in this instance the

specific statement in the deal is we're not going to

So they sought both in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But do I understand

15

your answer to be that disgorgement serves at least an

16

additional function beyond the injunction, sort of an

17

unjust enrichment element?

18

profit in a typical contract case?

19

MR. COOKSON:

You've got to disgorge your

Yes, it does serve that

20

function in a case where, as this Court suggested, there

21

is a deliberate act, yes.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can you get in a normal

23

contract case both your damages and disgorgement?

24

always thought you were put to the choice.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF
MR. McALLISTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, and may it please the Court:

16

I wanted to go back to something

17

Justice Kagan correctly identified as that when these

18

procedures were negotiated there were lots of options on

19

the table.

20

parties chose was not Kansas's first choice.

21

Nebraska's first choice.

22

were being made, and I think this case is directly

23

analogous to New Hampshire v. Maine, which is talked

24

about in the briefs, where those two States reached a

25

boundary agreement.

In fact, the groundwater model option the
It was

And these kind of trade­offs

And the Court said, well, your

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

agreement may not be perfect, but you were dealing with

2

some vague terms, some uncertainties, you've done

3

something reasonable, we bless it.

4

Hampshire came back and said:

5

deal.

6

have agreed to that 25 years ago.

7

25 years later New

You know, we made a bad

We'd like you to undo it because we shouldn't

And the Court gave New Hampshire the answer

8

we think you should give Nebraska today, which is:

9

Sorry; you made the deal, and just because you now think

10

you have a better way of doing it doesn't mean we should

11

rewrite the contract.

12

If the Court rewrites the contract here, the

13

compact ­­ well, the procedures which are part and

14

parcel, as the United States recognizes of the FSS ­­

15

there is no clear black and white distinction between

16

the procedures and the settlement agreement, they don't

17

work unless they are both present.

18

now, it opens the door ­­ if Kansas comes up with a

19

better way 2 years from now to measure this, then we

20

would be able to come back.

21

we'd come all the way to this Court again, saying:

22

know, there was a mistake because there was a better way

23

than the 5­run solution to do this.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If you rewrite them

And if Nebraska says no,
You

Mr. McAllister, how much

more are you going to get under the accounting

55
Alderson Reporting Company

procedures as they exist without the 5­mile run?
MR. McALLISTER:

Yeah, I believe on an

3

annual basis the difference is on the order of 8 to

4

10,000 acre feet.

5

Nebraska wants that much more taken out of its

6

consumptive use.

So that's the difference in what ­­

money?

Give me money?
Oh, what it's worth in

Well, that's a big dispute.

I mean, the master

10

when he valued the gain used some figures from Nebraska

11

evidence that was $362 per acre foot.

12

ways to try to value the water, and we haven't tried to

13

quantify that amount.

14

affects actually the total amount we get.
