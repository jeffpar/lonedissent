ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALYZA LEWIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. LEWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

How an American is identified in his or her

11

passport or U.S. Consular Report of Birth Abroad,

12

including the place of birth designation, does not

13

amount to formal recognition by the United States of

14

that designated location's sovereign status.

15

the principal reason why Congress's law authorizing

16

Jerusalem­born citizens to carry passports that say they

17

were born in Israel is a legitimate congressional

18

exercise of Congress's power to regulate foreign

19

commerce, naturaliza ­­

passport has been listed as Israel at the holder's

This designation is neither an acknowledgment

nor a declaration by the Department of State or the

President of the United States that Jerusalem is within

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If you were careful to say

16

just misinterpreting the way this ­­ the court of

17

appeals discussed it?

18

MS. LEWIN:

We've provided to the Court

19

alternative options for resolving this issue.

20

primary position, as I said at the outset, is that what

21

is written in this statute does not amount to a formal

22

recognition of sovereignty because the language of the

23

statute itself is very narrow.

24
25

Our

It begins by saying that, for the purposes

It also does not state that in all circumstances you

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is merely

The ­­ the ­­ does ­­ the

throughout 214, that is, that Jerusalem is the capital

11

trying to deal with a piece of one section without

13

14

that Congress has said we think Jerusalem is the capital

This section of the statute should be reviewed

You could

5

But the Solicitor General of the United

6

States, after conferring with the State Department,

7

says, "Since Israel's founding, every President has

8

adhered to the position that the status of Jerusalem

9

should not be unilaterally determined by a party," and

10

he adds, "by requiring the President to contradict his

11

recognition position regarding Jerusalem in official

12

communications with foreign sovereigns, the section

13

unconstitutionally encroaches on the President's core

14

recognition authority."

15

So he has a different view.

He thinks it is

16

our policy not to recognize Jerusalem as the capital,

17

which you apparently agree with, and he thinks that this

18

does have some tendency at least to suggest the

19

contrary.

20

Now, I'm a judge.

I'm not a foreign affairs

21

expert.

22

affairs experts in the State Department, how can I say

that I'm right even if I agree with you, and they, who

question ­­

MS. LEWIN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the question ­­
­­ which I'd like an answer

21

to.

22

the policy of the State Department in that thing that's

23

FAM, which is the Foreign Affairs Manual, says pretty

24

clearly that if there's a dispute about the larger

25

power, i.e., China, you always can put in your passport

3

I'm saying the experts saying that the Taiwan example

4

conflicted with their policy.

Did China not object to it?

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

China objected to that.

China may have done ­­ I

policy.

That's what they think, and this is.

18

MS. LEWIN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

So one last point on Taiwan ­­
I'd like the first point.

What am I supposed to do in respect to that?

21

MS. LEWIN:

Well, the first ­­ the first

22

point is that this ­­ what goes on the passport does not

Ms. Lewin, I ­­ I thought

5

your position was you couldn't care less if the State

Constitution, even when that contradicts ­­ let's assume

JUSTICE BREYER:

If you take that position,

2

which explains it, then what do you think of Justice

3

Story who writes in 1833 that, "The exercise of the

4

prerogative of acknowledging new nations and

5

ministers" ­­ and he makes clear that involves whether a

6

city or a region is part of a country, et cetera, he

7

says, it's an executive function.

8

I think we've just heard, that Congress could make that

9

decision, too, but that hasn't been decided.

Some argue, as we ­­

And he

10

concludes that, "A power so extensive in its reach over

11

our foreign relations could not properly be conferred on

12

13

little doubt."

14

MS. LEWIN:

you have to have one person deciding such a thing, and

17

that has to be the Executive.

MS. LEWIN:

That's 1833, pretty

But that is a rather extreme

20

position, number one, to suggest that the Executive

21

Branch would have not only the authority to recognize a

22

There ­­ well, there is review,

and even ­­ both to respond to Justice Sotomayor and

10

Justice Breyer, Justice Story and William Rawle both

11

recognize that authority of Congress to review.

12

Justice Story also said that, "If such

13

recognition is made, it's conclusive upon the nation

14

unless, indeed, it can be reversed by an act of Congress

15

repudiating it."

16

"If the President refuses to recognize, then he said

17

Congress may, notwithstanding, solemnly acknowledge the

18

sovereignty of the nation or party."

19

And then he went further to say that,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose ­­ I

20

suppose you could also say Hamilton in 1787 or whatever

21

it was trumped Story in 1830, right?

22

pretty much the exact opposite, that the recognition

provision was really just a trivial formality.

14

he issued a birth certificate by the Israeli

authorities?

16

MS. LEWIN:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.
And the United States

18

recognizes that as ­­ as a lawful exercise of Israeli

19

authority, to issue a birth certificate for a child born

20

in Jerusalem?

21

MS. LEWIN:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

I believe they do, Your Honor.
So what ­­ this is a

23

question I would ask the Solicitor General, but I don't

24

completely understand what the position of the United

25

States is regarding Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem.

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

I understand it is the position of the United States

2

that Israel does not exercise full sovereignty over

3

Jerusalem, but in that ­­ in this instance, the issuance

4

of a birth certificate, and others I can think of, I

5

suspect the United States recognizes that Israel is

6

lawfully exercising attributes of sovereignty over the

7

territory of Jerusalem.

8

Is that correct?

So if someone ­­ let's say an American

9

citizen committed a crime in Jerusalem, would the United

10

States take the position that the Israeli government has

11

no lawful authority to prosecute that person for the

12

crime?

13

MS. LEWIN:

I do not believe so, Your Honor.

14

I believe that they would feel that the Israeli

15

government has the authority to prosecute that crime.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Lewin, if I can ask you,

17

if your primary position is that this is not a

18

recognition statute, can we talk a little bit about what

19

it is?

20

is the effect of this statute other than as something

21

that goes to recognition?

22

I mean, why ­­ what ­­ what is the design, what

MS. LEWIN:

This statute is a statute that

23

was created to give individuals the right to

24

self­identify as they choose that they were born in

25

Israel.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the United States

2

Government does not usually give people that right to

3

self­identify in this way.

4

was the Chief Justice's question in the first argument,

5

if you're an American citizen born in Northern Ireland,

6

you can't get the right to say Ireland.

7

matter, if you are an American citizen born in Jerusalem

8

today, you can't get the rights to say Palestine.

9

In other words, I think this

For that

This is a very selective vanity plate law,

10

if we might call it that.

11

because Congress had, it appears to me, and it's

12

consistent with the rest of the statute, as Justice

13

Ginsburg said, a real view that this was the

14

self­identification it wanted.

15

ability of American citizens to say yes, I was born in

16

Jerusalem, and that means I was born in Israel.

17

and only that self­identification is allowed.

MS. LEWIN:

And ­­ and it's selective

In other words, the

That

This statute was rectifying a

19

misguided policy of the State Department which enabled

20

individuals born in Israel proper, whether in Tel Aviv

21

or in Haifa, who were opposed politically to the State

22

of Israel to remove that sovereign, to remove reference

23

to Israel from their passport, but it did not allow the

24

flip.

25

and who live under the sovereign government of Israel,

It did not allow those who are born in Jerusalem

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about Palestinians

5

their place of birth?

6

that option.

7

MS. LEWIN:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, again, your

10

argument ­­ and you're consistent on this, your first

11

argument is that this is not recognition.

12

the State Department, and I think this is its position,

13

says this is recognition.

14

Department's judgment, to the government's executive

15

judgment on that point, and the government said this is

16

recognition, and you say it isn't recognition, why

17

doesn't the government trump?

18

the Congress really wants to test its power, it can pass

19

a law saying you must recognize Israel as being the

20

legitimate government of Palestine, but it has not done

21

that.

22

the government's argument trumps.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I ­­ I guess there are

14

competing canons here.

15

we listen to the State Department on matters of foreign

16

affairs, but I suppose another one is that we do not

17

hold a ­­ an act of Congress to be unconstitutional and

18

thereby ineffective.

19

doesn't it?

I mean, one is, I suppose, that

So that seems to me a draw,

20

MS. LEWIN:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, Justice Scalia.
So the State Department

22

says this amounts to recognition, and Congress says

23

whether it does or not, we want ­­ we want this person

24

to be able to list Israel.

25

MS. LEWIN:

That is correct.

19

was signed into law by the President, the law right now

2

trumps whatever the Executive Branch may say.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ­­ can I give you a

hypothetical, Ms. Lewin?

law and this law said that the Secretary of State had to

6

send an official letter to all foreign ministers

7

whenever a U.S. citizen was born in Jerusalem, and that

8

official letter from the Secretary of State said ­­ says

10

in Israel.

11
12
13

Suppose that Congress passed a

MS. LEWIN:

Excuse me, this would be a law

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is a law passed by

14

Congress and it says every time a U.S. citizen is born

15

in Jerusalem, the Secretary of State has to send an

16

official letter to every other foreign minister saying

17

that a new American has been born in Israel.

18
19
20

MS. LEWIN:

Yes, that would be

constitutional.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

That would be

21

constitutional, even though the ­­ the Congress is

22

basically telling the Secretary of State to engage in a

23

certain kind of diplomatic communication with other

24

foreign countries.

25

MS. LEWIN:

The description of the law that

you provide seems to be very similar to what a passport

4

information to the foreign government.

A passport recognizes an individual as an

That

was going to be my point, that it was ­­

7

(Laughter).

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Yes, exactly right.

­­ that it was extremely

similar to what a passport does, that both are forms of

10

diplomatic communication, and that what we usually say

11

about diplomatic communication is that whatever

12

Congress's other foreign affairs powers are, the power

13

of diplomatic communication belongs to the President and

14

the President alone; that in that realm we only speak

15

with one voice.

16

And so I guess I have to sort of say that

17

that answer that you gave me, that this could ­­ that

18

Congress could say to the Secretary of State, here's the

19

diplomatic communication that you have to send to other

20

foreign ministers, seems, well, a little bit shocking.

21

MS. LEWIN:

But recognizing an individual as

22

an American citizen facilitates the transfer and the

23

movement of American citizens across borders.

24

this passport, if it were to list Israel pursuant to

25

this law, would be indistinguishable from all the other

Alderson Reporting Company

This ­­

passports of individuals born in Tel Aviv or Haifa or

anywhere else in Israel.

3

shown, be making any kind of political statement.

4

would merely be identifying the individual by their

5

name, date of birth, place of birth, as all American

6

passports of individuals identify them.

7

That passport would not, when

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

So you would say in

8

Justice Kagan's hypothetical, maybe the letter that's

9

required to be sent to every foreign head of state would

10

be unconstitutional, but that doesn't mean that the

11

passport is, because the passport is used primarily for

12

purposes of identification, and it's only the letter

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I thought it was a

Federal crime to say that you were born in the United

States when you weren't on an official document.

5

why ­­ why is it that it's okay for Congress to say

6

something that hasn't happened, meaning to say that

7

someone born in Jerusalem is actually born in Israel?

8

It's different than somebody who's born in ­­ in Taiwan

MS. LEWIN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

So

Since 19 ­­
I mean, they can

self­identify all they want, but can they do that?

13

MS. LEWIN:

Yes.

Since 1948, Israel has

14

acted as the sovereign over western Jerusalem where our

15

client was born, and since 1967 over the entire area of

16

Jerusalem.

17

So ­­ so ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know what it's done,

18

but has the U.S. recognized ­­ has any President since

19

1948 recognized Israel's sovereignty over that area?

20

MS. LEWIN:

In a formal sense, no.

But

21

allowing individuals to recognize that, that would not

22

be a false statement.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Lewin, may I just ­­ I

24

know your time is ­­ but if I might just go back to the

25

thought that the Chief Justice gave you that you agreed

with.

"The Secretary of State of the United States of America

3

hereby requests all who it may concern to permit the

4

citizen," blah, blah, blah.

5

the ­­ you know, the Secretary of State requests all of

6

these who are going to be looking at this passport.

7

Here's the way a passport begins.

It begins,

That's what ­­ that's

And then in Haig v. Agee, we described a

8

passport as a letter of introduction in which the

9

issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests

10

other sovereigns to aid the bearer.

passport, it seems, both on what it says itself and on

12

what we've said about it, it's like a letter from the

13

Secretary of State.

14

So this is, this

It's a communication.

MS. LEWIN:

It is a communication merely to

15

facilitate this transfer of individuals as American

16

citizens, not to make public statements about where they

17

were born or where they're from or what countries the

18

United States recognizes.

Section 214(d).

position of the United States, it tries to deny the

5

President the power to give effect to our official

situation that was ­­ it wasn't the case when it was

The fundamental problem with Section 214(d)

is that it purports to try to force the Executive Branch

to issue official diplomatic communications that

25

contradict the position of the United States.

26

JUSTICE ALITO:

But is that really true?

Suppose ­­ could Congress pass a law saying that every

passport ­­ every passport issued to an American citizen

4

5

that for this purpose, the country is the nation that

6

issued the birth certificate to that individual?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I ­­ I think that that ­­

that in a situation like that, the Court ought to defer

to the Executive Branch's judgment that the place of

11

birth listing can have significant diplomatic

12

consequences.

13

in this country that align place of birth designations

14

with our official recognition policy.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

The critical point,

8

Your Honor, is that what this statute does that those

other statutes don't do is it requires the Executive

10

Branch, the President himself and the Executive Branch

itself, to communicate a message that contradicts the

have to address the question of exclusive power to rule

petitioner's position that 214(d) does not change

recognition, the official recognition position of the

United States, then that's a given, that the official

12

recognition position of the United States is that we are

13

not recognizing any nation's sovereignty over Jerusalem

14

at this point until the parties work it out.

15

With that as a given, the separation of

16

powers problem with Section 214(d) is that it forces the

17

Executive Branch to engage in diplomatic communications

that contradict our official recognition position and

undermine the President's credibility, and that ­­

President's position on recognition, which is the same
