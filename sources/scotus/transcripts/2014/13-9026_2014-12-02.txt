Mr. Carpenter.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSHUA B. CARPENTER
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CARPENTER: Thank you Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:
The basic bank robbery offense under

12

Section 2113(a) requires the robber to use force,

13

intimidation or violence against another person.

14

Section (e)'s forced accompaniment provision is designed

15

for much more extreme conduct that Congress viewed as

16

roughly on par with murder.

17

would have that provision and its ten­year mandatory

18

minimum apply any time that a robber forces someone to

19

take a single step with him in the course of a robbery.

20

That single step rule isn't justified by the

And yet the government

21

text of the statute, and it isn't necessary to ensure

22

just punishment for bank robbers.

23
24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To my wife's table.
Well, even if there is some

8

question about whether the usage of just a movement of a

22

I

It may be a very foolish

But ­­ but we apply what ­­ what Congress

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, Justice Scalia, first,

23

whether there's ambiguity is determined not by looking

24

at the word "accompany" in isolation.

25

said last year in the Utility Air context ­­ or in the

Alderson Reporting Company

But as the Court

Official

6
1

Utility Air case, the words of the statute are

2

interpreted in their context and with a view towards

3

their place in the statutory scheme.

4

that the word "accompany" serves in the statutory scheme

5

is to set off a set of extreme conduct that Congress

6

viewed as roughly on par with murder.

7

in Section (e) with the killing offense tells us under

8

the Noscitur principle that Congress viewed a forced

9

accompaniment as akin to murder.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Here the place

Its association

20 steps ­­ 20 steps is

11

horrible enough for Congress to have believed it's

12

enough of an accompaniment?

13

MR. CARPENTER:

What?
Well,

Half a mile?

What?

we don't

14

believe there's going to be a bright­line rule based on

15

the number of steps or the number of feet.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't insist on a

17

bright­line rule.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

about 4 to 9 feet, which is approximately from where

So the movement wasn't the 20 feet from the front door.

But, first, the

10

It was from the threshold of the hallway into the

11

computer room.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is it contextual?

13

In other words, is 20 feet in her home different from

14

20 feet in the bank?

15

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

Well, I think 20 feet

16

all within a single building is almost never going to

17

qualify because that cannot be so significantly

18

different from the conduct that is covered by an

19

ordinary (a) offense that Congress would have viewed it

20

as extreme enough to justify a ten­year mandatory

21

minimum penalty.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it seems ­­ the

23

reason I ask is that it ­­ it strikes me that it makes a

24

difference if it's in part of the robbery itself.

3

takes the teller from the bank to the car and then, you

4

know, they ­­ they block the car, that strikes me as

5

something different even though the distance might be

6

the same.

7

That's what happens in a bank

If on the other hand, the ­­ the defendant

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, you're right and we

8

agree with you on the ­­ that it is a contextual

9

inquiry.

10
11

So taking the ­­ the person out of the bank

and into the car is very likely going to qualify.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Except that the statute

12

says "both in the course of or in fleeing from."

13

obviously envisions an accompaniment in the course of

14

the bank robbery, doesn't it?

So it

15

MR. CARPENTER:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The answer is yes, right?

17

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, that language in our

I ­­ I believe ­­

18

view would be satisfied by the hypothetical ­­ or by

19

the ­­ not a hypothetical ­­ by an actual case that we

20

see in Wilson, for example, which is cited in the

21

government's brief where the bank robber goes to a bank

22

employee's home, forces them to come with him from their

23

home to the bank to facilitate the robbery.

24

absolutely an accompaniment in the commission of the

25

offense.

That's

I don't think anything in the statute suggests

Alderson Reporting Company

10

that there must be some category of accompaniment within

2

the walls of the bank only.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the test is ­­ if the

4

test is that there must be something that's substantial,

5

how would you instruct the jury?

6

MR. CARPENTER:

We would instruct the jury

7

first to say it must be more than de minimus or trivial

8

movement.

9

jury to consider factors such as the amount of distance

You could go further than that and ask the

10

that was covered, whether the person was moved into or

11

out of a bank or another building and whether they were

12

ultimately transported to a different place or location

13

than where they were found.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But your first ­­ when you

15

just said it's not de minimis, is that your primary

16

argument?

17

You just want a non­de minimis rule?

MR. CARPENTER:

We believe that resolves

18

this case.

MR. CARPENTER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why wouldn't it be

13

substantial when you go from one room to another?

14

doesn't that satisfy the definition of substantial?

15

MR. CARPENTER:

The reason for that, I

think, is if you look at the structure ­­

Why

MR. CARPENTER:

So if you go from

I think the problem with

21

that interpretation, Justice Kennedy, is that it sweeps

statistics that we were shown is that the vast majority

of bank robberies are at the counter, that people are

not moved at all.

16

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, we don't know the

latter aspect of that in that no one ­­ including the

government under the current iteration of the U.S.

accompaniment was not just walking, it was also staying

some of this conduct where people are forced to

8
9

MR. CARPENTER:

I think if Congress wanted

to adopt the government's interpretation of this

10

statute, it should have said forces someone to accompany

11

him for any distance whatsoever.

12

the word accompany which, in our view, in its ordinary

13

usage implies something more than the movement of a single

step.

MR. CARPENTER:

That is what I have a

Well I think in part you are

over reading what Congress was trying to do here by

suggesting that if the person was put in particular fear

or danger or trauma that that would justify any charge.

That’s – That’s not what he was looking at.

10
11

Because we

know ­­
JUSTICE ALITO:

What is the reason for this?

12

Why a heavier penalty for a case where there is

accompaniment it it's not that there is greater ­­

14

across the whole category, greater likelihood of trauma

15

to the person who is involved?

16

MR. CARPENTER:

We know that Congress viewed

17

the forced accompaniment provision as similar to

18

kidnapping, which under the Federal law at the time

19

required transportation entirely out of State and under

20

common law required transportation out of the country.

21

Under even the common definition of kidnapping at page

30 of our brief required more than a confinement or a

false imprisonment.

MR. CARPENTER:

So you may not know this but

6

­­ I think, Justice Scalia, you do know it from the

7

context, and particularly from the association that

8

Congress made in Section (e) between forced

9

accompaniment and killing.

It made both of those crimes

10

eligible for the death penalty at the discretion of the

11

jury.

12

there were only a handful of offenses that carried the

13

potential for the death penalty.

14

and kidnapping.

15

And if you look at the broader code at that time,

Among them were murder

So I think that is one very good reason why

16

we know that Congress would have been thinking of

17

accompaniment as something akin to kidnapping, which it

18

had in other provisions of the code ­­

But what we are saying ­­ to go back to the question

2

about what we're trying to distinguish here, we believe

3

that forced accompaniment and the instruction that we've

4

suggested for the jury allows the jury to distinguish

5

cases of confinement on the one hand ­­ where the

6

movement is incidental to a confinement, you are keeping

7

a person in their home, you are keeping the person in

the bank ­­ it distinguishes those from cases that we

would in a nontechnical sense think of as a kidnapping

10

or an abduction where you are taking someone from the

11

bank with you on the getaway, which was the John

12

opposite scenario that I talked about from the Wilson case

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, I think when you put

3

the words they use in the context in which they use

4

them, it limits it to that kind of scenario.

5

the government has never thought that these kinds of ­­

6

a few steps of movement inside the bank qualify as a

forced accompaniment.

in our reply brief at pages 12 and 13, all of which were

9

charged under (a) or (d) and all of which clearly

And even

I would point to the cases cited

10

involve movement that would easily satisfy the

11

government's single­step rule here.

12

those cases, based on the guidelines, based on the 3553A

13

factors, the district courts imposed sentences well

14

below the 10­year mandatory minimum that would apply

15

under a Section (e) charge.

Yet in each of

We know that if the Court here blesses the

single­step rule that the government is now advocating,

the Justice Department's charging guidelines will be to

include a Section (e) count in every bank robbery where

That surely cannot be what Congress intended in the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. FLETCHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Section 2113(e) prescribes greater

18

punishment for a bank robber who forces another

19

person to accompany him in committing the robbery or in

20

attempting to avoid arrest.

21

When Petitioner invaded the Parnell home and

22

forced Mrs. Parnell to go with him to a different room

23

where they could not be seen by the police, he violated

24

that statute because the forced movement fell squarely

25

within the ordinary meaning of the word "accompany."

Alderson Reporting Company

In

Official

28
1
2

everyday speech it is both proper and common to say that
one person accompanied someone else from one room

3

of the house to another, and Congress chose to use that

4

broad non­technical term in framing Section 2113(e).

5

didn't include any qualifying language requiring that

6

the forced accompaniment traverse a particular number of

7

feet, cross the threshold of a building or otherwise

8

cover a substantial distance.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes, but all the

10

definitions begin by saying accompanying is go with

somebody as an associate or companion.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But they didn't care

2

exactly what the minimum was, right, even before the

3

sentencing guidelines, which would obviously have a

4

higher sentence, they didn't care if it was one year

5

because of extenuating circumstances, whatever.

6

they said, forcing someone to accompany you is so much

7

more serious that you get at least 10 years.

8
9

MR. FLETCHER:

But,

And I think that they had

good reason to do that, but I also just want to

10

highlight that the 10­year mandatory minimum that they

11

set for the forced accompaniment offense is right in the

12

middle of the range for a completely unaggravated,

13

unarmed bank robbery in violation of Section 2113.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. FLETCHER:

Range where?
Of the statutory range of

16

zero ­­ probation to 20 years.

17

20 years and Congress set the limit for a nonaggravated

18

bank robbery.

19

the statutory maximum is 25 years.

20

The statutory maximum is

For an armed bank robbery under 2113(d),

And so when Congress established a mandatory

21

minimum penalty for Section 2113(e) at 10 years,

22

absolutely it did that because it regarded 2113(e)

23

violations as culpable conduct that merited enhanced

24

punishment a deterrence.

25

understood that there were going to be unaggravated bank

But it also made clear that it

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

31

robberies and armed bank robberies that warranted

2

greater punishment than forced accompaniments and it

3

left room for sentencing judges and now, with the

4

guidelines, for sentences to be framed in a way that

5

took account of the type of aggravating circumstances

6

like pistol whipping the victim and threats and things

7

of the nature that you described that don't trigger a

8

statutory enhancement but that obviously sentencing

9

judges would consider.

And what is worrying me about it is, since

23

it's a mandatory minimum, the prosecutors have a choice

about whether to ­­ to indict or not on that ground, and

25

a person who is coming in and who is represented and ­­

5

that's the nature of the mandatory minimum which is

disturbing and calls, I think, for some kind of lenity

separate the cases that seem comparatively trivial

But on the

taking place within the bank from the ones where you

11

really are injecting fear, special fear, into the mind

12

of the person who is told to accompany you, and that

13

could take place even if it's like one foot, because

14

he's been singled out.

Okay.

Is there any way to do it?

16

that he's been talking about nonstop, your brother over

21

routinely?

22

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes, absolutely.

I think ­­

23

I would like to say a number of things.

24

first one goes to the charging question that you asked

25

and that my friend referred to.

Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

He pointed to the

33

cases, the four cases that he cites at pages 12 and 13

2

of his reply brief as examples that would fall under our

3

definition of forced accompaniment but that weren't

4

charged as such in this case.

5

those particular cases.

But I think ­­ or in

6

I think what is important to highlight about

7

that is that three of the four cases arose in circuits

8

that have already adopted our rule.

9

Seventh Circuit and one was in the Eleventh Circuit and

One was in the

10

one was in the Ninth Circuit, and the Seventh and

11

Eleventh Circuits have specifically said that movement

within a bank, our rule here, you don't have to move

13

anyone a particular distance, you don't have to move

14

them out of the building.

15

weren't charged in that case reflects an exercise of the

16

government's charging discretion, not the fact that the

rule that we're asking you to adopt today had been

18

blessed by those circuits.

But that's what you are

going to lead it to, Mr. Fletcher, it's just going to be

even very, very short movements.

But, well, I was going to try

8

to get to the answer, which is that the reason why

9

Congress did that and I think the discussion today

10

highlights is because, number one, it's very, very hard

11

to separate out the cases that drive at the heartland of

12

what Congress was concerned about, the human shield and

13

the hostages situations, with any sort of rule based on

14

distance.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But I don't think ­­ it's perfectly sensible and courts

The U.S. attorney's manual

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so you think

4

when the manual says forcibly abducts, it means the

5

two­foot situation.

6

MR. FLETCHER:

Potentially, yes.

The

7

manual and it's not the way that it's used in the

2

provision of the guidelines which provides an

3

enhancement for a bank robbery or for any robbery that

4

involves the abduction of a victim.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the manual is

6

read ­­ forcibly abducts, they read as for somebody to

7

move two feet.

8
9
10
11

That's an abduction?

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes.

They don't view it as

limiting the charges under Section 2113(e) to require
movement of any particular distance.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so the manual

12

which ­­ the other provision in the manual which is that

13

you should charge as large an offense as possible means

14

that in the case where somebody is forced to move two

15

feet, you charge the ­­ that as a forcible abduction.

16

MR. FLETCHER:

No, that is not correct and

17

in part that is because the manual doesn't say you

18

always charge the most serious offense.

19

charge the most serious offense that's consistent with

20

the nature of the conduct at issue and that that

21

permits, and in fact requires, an individualized

22

assessment of the defendant's conduct.

23
24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It says you

So is two feet

consistent with the conduct at issue?
MR. FLETCHER:

Well, I think ­­ I think

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

there is a reason and I ­­ I do think there's a reason

2

why Congress covered even very short movements, and

3

that's in part because every time a robber forces

4

someone to go with him he exposes that person to a great

5

degree of trauma, to physical danger, and I think also

6

Congress reasonably decided not to try to write in a

7

limitation to use a term that includes movements as

8

short as a few feet because it's so difficult to draw a

9

line.

It's difficult to draw an administrable line at

10

all.

And any of the lines that have been offered to you

11

by my friend, by the amicus briefs, by the lower courts

12

that have tried to cabin this statute by departing from

13

its text, all of them would exclude cases that would

14

give rise to exactly the sorts of dangers that Congress

15

was concerned about, which are robbers using victims as

16

human shields, or robbers holding the gun to the head of

17

the victim and dragging them around the bank during the

18

offense.

19

what Congress was concerned about.

20

I think all of those are at the heartland of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

When Congress first drafted

21

this accompanying language, this was a capital offense,

22

yes?

MR. FLETCHER:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Potentially, yes.
So, I mean, would you say

the same thing if it were still a capital offense?

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

MR. FLETCHER:

We would.

We think the ­­

2

the offense had the same meaning then and now.

3

think part of the reason why we'd say that is, first and

4

foremost, that the statutory language we think

5

"accompanying" has a plain meaning that includes those

6

sorts of movements.

And I

7

But also I think it ­­ it's true, my friend

8

likes to point out that it was potentially death

9

eligible, but the sentencing range in the 1934 statute

10

was a minimum of 10 years to a death sentence if the

11

verdict of the jury shall so recommend.

7

very unlikely that Congress meant to give the death

8

penalty to somebody who forced another person to move

9

two feet.

10

MR. FLETCHER:

And I think Congress probably

11

understood that a jury would be very unlikely, in fact,

12

almost certain not to recommend the death penalty in a

13

case like that.

But the alternative is just this sort of

vast discretion in bank robbery cases where ­­ where

there has been nothing more like an inch or it really

distances were miniscule.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a very bad statute.

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Would you admit that?

12

MR. FLETCHER:

I would disagree with that.

13

I would say though that even if you agree with that,

14

that's not a reason to read it other than according to

15

its terms.

16

And I think, Justice Breyer, my friend likes

17

to suggest that if you go our way on this you really are

18

going to open up this discretion for prosecutors to

19

charge the 2113(e) offense in a vast number of cases.

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. FLETCHER:

Yes, that's true.

of evidence.

So I think potentially in ­­

position.

9

That person is still in a very, very bad

I think Congress reasonably decided that it

10

wanted to deter bank robbers from involving innocent

11

people in their offense.

12

the decision to deter that sort of conduct at the very

13

first step by writing the statute in a way that

14

prohibits forced accompaniment, a term that as our briefs

15

demonstrate, readily encompasses the type of movement at

16

issue here from one room to another.

17

readily encompasses even movements as short as a few

18

steps.

And I think it sensibly made

And I think also

19

The example that my friend gave earlier was

20

moving from one side of the lectern to another, and he

21

suggested that movements of that order aren't ­­ aren't

22

sensibly described as accompaniments.

23

contrary, if Mr. Dreeben had joined me when I came to

24

the lectern to present my argument a few minutes ago, we

25

would very easily say that he accompanied me to the

Alderson Reporting Company

I think to the

lectern to present the argument.
This Court used the word "accompany" to

3

describe a movement of just a few steps in Washington v.

4

Chrisman where the issue was a police officer

5

accompanying a college student from the public corridor

6

of the student's dorm into the student's dorm room.

7

I think by choosing to use that term, Congress made the

8

judgment that forced movements with a robber present

9

enhanced dangers, present greater trauma to the victims,

And

10

and that it was appropriate to deter and punish that

11

conduct with a broad rule, because in every instance

12

where it arises, it presents some dangers.

13

because to try to draft any line that excludes some of

14

the types of hypotheticals that the Court has proposed

15

today would be very difficult to do, would produce an

16

arbitrary and hard to administer standard and would

MR. CARPENTER:

Thank you.

I would offer

the Court first a twist on the old adage from

10

Justice Holmes, which is to say that sad facts sometimes

11

make very bad law.

12

undoubtedly sad, but the broad rule that the government

13

seeks to apply here would cover cases where the facts

14

aren't as sad and aren't ­­ aren't tragic at all.

15

The facts of this case are

I would go to your point, Justice Scalia,

16

about whether we should somehow interpret the statute to

17

cover cases where there's particularly heightened

18

trauma.

19

had nothing to do with the movement from one room to

20

another and it had everything to do with the fact that

21

he invaded her home.

22

turn ­­ the application of this provision can't turn on

23

the happenstance of whether she was sitting in her room

24

when he walked in or whether she happened to be standing

25

at the hallway and he asked her to move into the room.

On that issue, there was trauma here, but it

So it can't ­­ this case can't

Also, the government repeatedly points out

2

all the bad conduct that can happen even where there is

3

movement of only a few feet, and it's inside the bank,

4

but it can be accompanied with physical assault, et

5

cetera.

6

brief at page 23 where my friend cites a series of cases

7

that he described as the most egregious examples of

8

forced movements over a short distance.

9

I would point the Court to the government's own

In each of those ­­ in three of those cases

10

they were decided under the guidelines, Davis, Lewis and

11

Reid.

12

the 3553(a) factors, the district courts imposed a

13

sentence well below the statutory maximum that was

14

available for an (a) offense.

15

that the enhanced statutory maximums under (e) aren't

16

necessary, even in these egregious cases where the

17

movement is accompanied by physical assault and where

18

it's of a short distance in the bank.

19

In each one, based on the guidelines and based on

What that tells us is

On the flip side, though, the government's

20

broad, single­step rule is going to be tremendously

21

harmful in the mine run of bank robberies where you have

22

only a few feet of movement and which present the

23

problems that many of you have touched upon about the

24

exercise of prosecutorial discretion.

25

It's important to point out that in his

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

55
1

presentation today, my friend mentioned that well, the

2

guidelines ­­ the guidelines charging manual doesn't

3

actually provide a limit here because abduction means

4

even movement of a single step.

5

government isn't disavowing the single­step rule.

6

continues to advance it before this Court.

7

So we know that the
It

And the government has also pointed to

8

problems with line drawing.

9

not easy to draw a line in a case like this.

There's no doubt that it is
But that

10

doesn't justify the Court or the government in throwing

11

up its hands and saying there's no line at all.

12

say that the rule of lenity should have special force in

13

the context of mandatory minimum provisions like this

14

one, both because of the notice that a criminal

15

defendant should receive that his conduct is so severe,

16

that he's going to face the mandatory minimum penalty as

17

severe as this one, and because of the harm to the

18

system that flows from a broadly applicable mandatory

19

minimum that gives the prosecution the ability to

20

threaten these charges in otherwise ordinary bank

21

robbery cases.

I would

22

If there are no further questions, we'd ask

23

the Court to reverse the (e) conviction and send this

24

case back for resentencing.
