ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FLEMING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court has been offered two ways to

11

approach this case, a short way and a long way.

12

believe we prevail under both and I will address both,

13

but I would start with the short way, which we think is

14

the right way.

15

17

This is a case about appellate

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You know the way to our

hearts.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. FLEMING:

20

We

I try to please, Justice

Kennedy.

21

This is a case about appellate jurisdiction

22

and specifically whether Congress has given the courts

23

of appeals jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion

24

to reopen that would be timely through the application

25

of equitable tolling.

And that question is answered by

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

Section 1252 of the INA, which creates jurisdiction over

2

denials of motion to reopen as the Court confirmed in

3

Kucana and it makes no distinction based on the grounds

4

of the denial of the motion to reopen.

5

In this case the board denied Mr. Mata's

6

motion as untimely, it ruled that equitable tolling was

7

generally available, but that Mr. Mata was not entitled

8

to it because it erroneously believed that his

9

misdemeanor assault conviction qualified as a crime

10

involving moral turpitude.

11

reviewable.

12

circuit.

13

government agrees, and Mr. Peterson as amicus, does not

14

mount any argument that that denial somehow does not

15

fall within the jurisdictional grant of Section 1252.

16

That legal error was

It would have been reviewed in any other

It should have been reviewed here and the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain why ­­ on

17

the surface, he beats up his girlfriend.

18

is not a crime involving moral turpitude?

19

thought that the ­­ the rest of this is academic if the

20

bottom line is he's committed a crime of moral

21

turpitude?

22

MR. FLEMING:

But why that
Because I had

Justice Ginsburg, first of

23

all, that ­­ that is a question that the First Circuit

24

did not reach and we submit should have reached.

25

answer the question, the BIA has a very developed

Alderson Reporting Company

But to

Official

5
1

jurisprudence regarding when assault crimes qualify as

2

crimes involving moral turpitude and it involves

3

consideration of a number of factors.

4

It involves not only the level of injury

5

that was either intended or caused, but also the level

6

of intent.

7

chargeable under the offense decreases from

8

intentionality to, say, recklessness, then the level of

9

bodily injury that is required has to concomitantly

10
11

And as the level of intent that is

increase in order for it to constitute moral turpitude.
In Texas, the simple assault statute that

12

Mr. Mata pled guilty under is not an aggravated assault

13

statute.

14

and that is defined in a purposely broad way, as the

15

Texas court of appeals has stated, to include even

16

injury caused by relatively minor physical contact.

It can be charged based only on bodily injury

17

So simple assault that can be charged under

18

that provision is not turpitudeness and that's what the

19

Board should have ruled and that was the argument that

20

was presented to the Fifth Circuit, but the Fifth

21

Circuit determined that it did not have jurisdiction to

22

decide. That is the issue we've asked this Court to

23

review.

24

turpitudeness or not quality of the offense under

25

Section 2201(a)(1)of the Texas Penal Code.

Of course, it does not need to go into the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

Because this is a jurisdictional question,

2

there is no need to go further to the issues that Mr.

3

Peterson is raising regarding whether there is equitable

4

tolling as a matter of merits under the INA.

5

think it's necessary.

MR. FLEMING:

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's ­­
Why ­­ why would it have

8

done that if it ­­ if it thought that, in fact, there

9

was some argument about whether ­­ whether they could

10

appeal the denial of extension in law as opposed to in

11

the sua sponte discretion of the agency?

12

MR. FLEMING:

It's ­­ there are two stages

13

to the answer, Justice Scalia.

14

that the decisions that issue from the Fifth Circuit do

15

not ­­ they have conclusory statements in them and not a

16

lot of reasoning.

17

And it's regrettable

First of all, you have the unpublished

18

decisions which say that the circuit will construe a

19

request for equitable tolling as a request for sua

20

sponte reopening.

21
22
23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

Why would one do

that?
MR. FLEMING:

So my best reading of them ­­

24

and again, the reasoning is sparse.

25

their view, equitable tolling is not a basis for filing

Which means there ­­

there's no equitable tolling.
MR. FLEMING:

I ­­ I ­­ now, that's not

5

something that they've ever adopted in a published

6

decision.

7

the reading the government, I think, endorses or at the

8

very least there's a dispute about it ­­ is that the

9

Fifth Circuit was saying the statue and the regulations

I think one reading of that ­­ and this is

10

on their terms do not use the words "equitable tolling."

11

That, of course, does not resolve the fundamental

12

question whether as a matter of statutory

13

interpretation ­­

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

MR. FLEMING:

Sure.
­­ or as a matter of

16

administrative authority equitable tolling can be

17

applied.

But I ­­ I want to be clear, we ­­ we do not

fear this question at all.

20

reach the merits issues that Mr. Peterson has put before

21

the Court, we are happy to fight on that ground.

22

simply want it to be plain that we didn't present the ­­

23

the jurisdictional question as including a merits

24

question.

25

then the Court has the briefing and I'm prepared to talk

And if the Court wishes to

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Do you acknowledge that

3

if ­­ if you view this as the Fifth Circuit viewed it,

4

as a request to review the sua sponte extension granted

5

by the agency, that the Fifth Circuit would have had no

6

jurisdiction over that?

7

MR. FLEMING:

We do not, Justice Scalia.

8

And I just want to be clear the context in which I

9

answer that question.

That requires a lot of steps

10

before the Court even gets to that.

11

not only requires getting to the merits issues, it

12

requires rejecting our primary ­­ our contention on the

13

merits, which is that as a matter of statutory

14

interpretation, this is tollable.

15

the government's position that at the very least, the

16

statute does not prohibit the board from implementing

17

the 90­day time limit by using equitable tolling.

18

if you get to that point such that you're in a

19

through­the­looking­glass world where the board was, in

20

fact, not doing what it thought it was doing, namely,

21

exercising authority under the statute, but instead,

22

exercising regulatory sua sponte authority, then you get

23

to the question, are there judicially manageable

24

standards to review what the board, in fact, did in this

25

case?

Alderson Reporting Company

First of all, it

The equitable tolling standards

The ineffective assistance standards are

Now, it may well be that there are other
situations where the board simply says request denied

10

and that may be a situation where jurisdiction would be

11

in doubt.

12

one where the board writes an opinion that says, here

13

are the standards we are applying and we believe that

14

the Petitioner is ineligible for equitable tolling

15

because his conviction is for a crime involving moral

16

turpitude, that is a legal question that is reviewable,

17

regardless of how you caption the authority under which

18

the board is acting.

19

But if you are talking about a case like this

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, I've ­­ I've

20

forgotten, but is there a circuit split on that third ­­

21

on the sua sponte review?

22

MR. FLEMING:

There is no circuit split as

23

such because every other circuit believes, as we think

24

is correct, that this kind of decision is reviewable as

25

a matter of statutory authority.

And that's what the

board is doing.

it's doing.

of decision.

So every other circuit to have decided the

JUSTICE GINSBURG: Then how do we make it clear

8

again that this statute is not susceptible to equitable

9

tolling and then we're right back where we are.

10

We say Fifth Circuit, you have

They say fine.

MR. FLEMING:

We said before and we say

If that is, in fact, what the

11

Fifth Circuit does, then it may well be, because then

12

there would be a clear circuit split on the merits

13

question of the availability of equitable tolling.

14

would hold out hope that the Fifth Circuit would not

15

create that circuit split; that when disabused of the

16

belief that it lacks jurisdiction, it would then engage

17

in the analysis that we and the government believe it

18

should engage in and find that like every other circuit

19

to have addressed the issue, there is, in fact,

20

equitable tolling available and would address Mr. Mata's

21

request for it on the merits.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Well, it knew at the time

Peterson has raised is, what does it go back with?

19

it go back solely with directions that the court has

jurisdiction and everything else should be addressed by

21

the ­­ the Fifth Circuit in the first instance, or does

it go back with a decision that, in addition to there

Mr. Yang.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL AND REMAND

8

MR. YANG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals here rested its

11

decision on a basic and fundamental error of

12

administrative law.

13

decision on its own terms, the court of appeals

14

recharacterized the question before it into a different

15

question over which it lacked jurisdiction.

16

is inconsistent with the Chenery rule, which, since even

17

before the APA, required that judicial review of agency

18

action be based on the rationale adopted by the agency.

19

Rather than review the board's

Also I would note that every single

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is no circuit

And Mr. Yang, could you

point me to the place in the board's decision that you

10

think makes clear what the board was doing?

11

I looked at the board's decision, honestly, I found it a

12

little bit difficult to tell whether the board was

13

denying it on statutory grounds or on sua sponte

14

grounds.

15

MR. YANG:

I agree with you that the board's

16

decision could be a little bit more clear.

17

background is helpful.

18

Because as

Some

This is a question of equitable tolling for

19

ineffective assistance of counsel.

20

And so that claim embodies at least four requirements.

21

One, you have to have normal equitable tolling

22

satisfied.

23

That's the claim.

You have to also show ineffective

24

assistance, and that has subparts, including prejudice

25

from the ineffective assistance, and you have to show

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

16
1

that you've met the requirements of the Lozada decision,

2

which has certain procedural showings that have to be

3

made.

4

Now, in order to get to equitable tolling,

5

you therefore have to show prejudice.

6

at Petition Appendix 7, after talking about Lozada in

7

the first full paragraph, in the second paragraph, they

8

say, you know, in Lozada, although the resulting

9

summary ­­ there was a summary dismissal of appeal, did

And if you look

10

not amount to a deprivation of due process and was not

11

prejudicial.

12

And then with respect to prejudice, they

13

explain on two bases, the decision here, or the alleged

14

ineffective assistance was not prejudicial, one, because

15

it was not a crime of ­­ there was a crime of moral

16

turpitude which precluded relief; and, two, the alien

17

failed to submit at the motion to reopen stage, evidence

18

showing that there was exceptional and extremely unusual

19

hardship.

20

All of that goes to prejudice, which goes to

21

the tolling question.

22

the statement earlier that the time for filing a motion

23

to reopen may be tolled in cases of ineffective

24

assistance of counsel, but then they were just focusing

25

on the second.

And the predicate, of course, was

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

So the way that we read the board, which I

2

think is the way the board has decided these cases

3

generally is that the questions of ineffective

4

assistance and equitable tolling here are kind of mixed.

5

And the board's decision addressed the ­­ the prejudice

6

prong of that ­­ those requirements.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I somehow have the

8

impression, I don't know, the AG is going to have some

9

kind of rulemaking relevant to this.

10

MR. YANG:

There is pending rulemaking, as

11

we noted in our brief.

12

rulemaking that the Department has submitted to OMD that

13

is expected to, you know, hopefully go forward.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is a notice of proposed

Rulemaking has to do with

15

the existence or nonexistence of equitable tolling under

16

this provision?

17

MR. YANG:

18

The rulemaking, of course, is not

public, but what I can tell you ­­

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. YANG:

Yes.
­­ is that the ­­ in the Compean

21

decision, the Attorney General addressed generally

22

questions of ineffective assistance of counsel.

23

the components of that was equitable tolling of the

24

deadline for ineffective assistance.

25

logical to assume that because the ­­ that Compean

Alderson Reporting Company

One of

It would be

Official

18
1

ruling was vacated in favor of the rulemaking, the

2

rulemaking scope could be similar to the Attorney

3

General's decision.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So on that assumption, that

5

would, as I understand it, give the Fifth Circuit

6

something new to think about in ­­ in addressing this

7

question; is that right?

8
9

MR. YANG:

It certainly would, and it would

also have the benefit, on remand, of the government's

10

clear view that there is equitable tolling here,

11

although not applicable to this alien, but just

12

generally equitable tolling is available as all the

13

courts of appeals have decided.

14

brief, we don't think the Fifth Circuit is precluded

15

even at the panel level from reaching that decision.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And as we note in our

Would the ­­ would the

17

Fifth Circuit, with this rulemaking, you can't tell us

18

what it is at this stage, this early stage, would it be

19

available, will they have a rule should we remand this

20

case to the Fifth Circuit?

21

MR. YANG:

I think it's unlikely there's

22

going to be a final rule by the time this Court's

23

decision is issued.

24

notice of proposed rulemaking being issued late this

25

year.

The unified agenda projects a

And then the notice and comment period would have

to elapse, and we'd have to get to a final rule.

2

don't think by the time June rolls around, we'll get the

3

final rule.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm ­­ I'm sorry, but there

5

would be an NPR when?

Late this calendar year?

6

MR. YANG:

Late this calendar year.

7
8
9

So I

That's

what the unified agenda projects.
So ­­ but again, I don't think sending this
case back on the very basic point that the Fifth Circuit

10

can't sidestep its obligation to review a motion to

MR. PETERSON:

Justice Breyer, as we

motions.

view.

I point you to Petitioner's arguments before the

Now, because, in the Fifth Circuit,

equitable tolling of the 90­day deadline is unavailable,

21

the Board of Immigration Appeals could have granted

relief only by exercising its sua sponte authority to

23

reopen.

24

Immigration Appeals could have reopened in this case.

25

Therefore, the Board of Immigration Appeals' decision

MR. PETERSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, we think

14

the difference here is that the deadline isn't simply a

15

question of whether the board was right or wrong in

16

denying the statutory motion.

17

the key distinction between whether the board's

18

discretion was unfettered on reopening or fettered on

19

reopening.

20

that is how we distinguish orders denying statutory

21

motions to reopen from orders denying motions to reopen

We see the timeliness as

5

MR. PETERSON:

Justice Kagan, as we've tried

to suggest it, the timeliness is related to the

the Fifth Circuit necessarily adopted the premise for

And maybe it's

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. PETERSON:

But let me point out though

2

that the Solicitor General might agree that equitable

3

tolling is available, but agrees with us that every

4

court of appeals other than the Fifth Circuit to have

5

addressed the availability of equitable tolling has

6

gotten its analysis wrong.

7

with us that the presumption of equitable tolling is

8

inapplicable to these sorts of statutes.

9

The Solicitor General agrees

Every court of appeals to have reached this,

10

as Petitioner does, reaches the result that equitable

11

tolling is available through the presumption of

12

equitable tolling.

13

suggests that the administrative rulemaking might

14

provide a solution to this.

15

circuits, and likely more, that's been foreclosed.

16

you look at the Second Circuit's decision in Iavorski,

17

the Ninth Circuit's decision in Soca­Gonzalez, both of

18

them note that Board of Immigrations Appeals' position

19

is that equitable tolling is unavailable.

20

conclude that the statute unambiguously requires

21

equitable tolling and reject deference to the agency.

22

And now the Solicitor General

Well, in at least two
If

Both of them

So to the extent that you have

23

administrative rulemaking here, as best I can

24

understand, the Fifth Circuit is the only circuit that

25

would actually be able to even potentially give effect

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38

2

to it.

And ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I'm totally

3

confused.

4

least in this situation, is there is no explicit command

5

in the statute about equitable tolling.

6

limit in the statute.

7

There's no explicit command in the statute it can't.

8
9

I ­­ I think what the agency is saying, at

There is a time

But can it be tolled or not?

And so as a matter of procedure, which
generally we give a huge amount of deference to the

10

agency, it has, albeit in unpublished opinions, followed

11

a practice of considering it in motions to reopen.

12

from that practice, they're telling us, there is,

13

because the agency has determined that, with respect to

14

IAC claims, that they will do it.

And

15

I don't actually see that much problem with

16

the problem, but I do agree with Justice Breyer that we

17

don't need to get to that question here, because we

18

really don't know whether that's the view of the Fifth

19

Circuit or not.

20

doesn't exist, I want to consider their reasons.

21

what we usually do.

22

And if they find it or if they say it
That's

But they haven't really given us reasons,

23

other than to say the statute requires it, but I don't

24

see why.

25

MR. PETERSON:

Justice Sotomayor, with

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

39
1

respect to the Fifth Circuit, I believe, I would hope,

2

that we've supplied the reasonings ­­ reasoning for why

3

the Fifth Circuit's decision on equitable tolling is

4

correct.

5

With respect to the agency determinations,

6

the Board of Immigration Appeals, with rare

7

exceptions ­­ and there's no suggestion that this case

8

is one ­­ will follow the authority of the circuit in

9

which it sits.

So you can certainly find numerous

10

unpublished Board of Immigration Appeals decisions

11

applying equitable tolling to the statutory deadline,

12

but they do so primarily because they are following the

13

circuit authority.

14

Now, the government agrees with us that the

15

Board of Immigration Appeals has not independently

16

interpreted the statute in a way that would receive

17

Chevron deference to require equitable tolling.

18

right now, I don't believe the board has taken an

19

official position, except for in the government's brief,

20

that equitable tolling of the statutory deadline is

21

available.

22
23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So

The odd thing with

saying ­­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's ­­ that's ­­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

­­ the Fifth Circuit

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

was right in saying we ­­ we ­­ so ­­ so we're going to

2

give the Petitioner another chance, we'll consider it

3

under sua sponte.

4

power to reopen on its own motion is not meant as a cure

5

for filing defects or otherwise circumvent the

6

regulation.

7

But the board said twice that its

So I think what they're saying is that if

8

there's a ­­ if there's a flaw, if the 90 days ­­ if the

9

90 days is ­­ can't be stretched, then we shouldn't

10

reach that same conclusion by saying, oh, but we can do

11

this sua sponte.

12

They ­­ they seem to be saying their

13

exercise of their sua sponte authority is controlled by,

14

do we have a rule that says 90 days and no more?

15

do have such a rule, we shouldn't be exercising our

16

authority sua sponte to get around that.

17

that's in the Petitioner Appendix at both 5 and 9, when

18

they say we shouldn't use our power to reopen on our own

19

motion that way, to get around what is the rule.

20

MR. PETERSON:

If we

And that's ­­

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

We do

21

think the Board of Immigration Appeals certainly uses

22

its sua sponte authority to reopen sparingly and

23

respectfully of the statutory deadlines.

24

here, the problem is giving effect to a deadline that

25

Congress set.

As we see

Congress certainly meant something when

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

it required these motions to reopen to be filed within

2

90 days.

3

And that means that the board's decision

4

whether to reopen sua sponte, in order to exist

5

alongside and not simply swallow that statutory

6

deadline, needs to be in some way different in kind.

7

And we think the way that it's different is that when

8

the board is reopening sua sponte, when it's considering

9

reopening on its own motion, that's a decision that is

10

wholly in the board's discretion, and that is

11

unreviewable in the courts under Heckler v. Chaney.

12

And so when an alien properly invokes the

13

statutory authority for reopening, the ability to reopen

14

within the 90 days that we all agree under Kucana is

15

reviewable, it's, of course, reviewable.

16

misses that statutory window, when he asks the board to

17

reopen after the 90­day period is done, the board's

18

decision whether or not to grant or to reopen is wholly

19

in the board's discretion.

20

When the alien

So when an alien asks the board to reopen ­­

21

and I think this case is the best example.

22

look at the request for reopening, you don't see, please

23

reopen using your statutory authority.

24

please reopen using your sua sponte authority to reopen.

25

You simply see, Board of Immigration Appeals, please

Alderson Reporting Company

When you

You don't see,

Official

42
1

reopen my case.

2

The way you determine what the true nature

3

of the board's authority is for the decision that it's

4

denying is whether that motion was filed within the

5

statutory time limit or without.

6

So if the court of appeals looks at it and

7

determines the alien asked for reopening after the end

8

of the statutory deadline, the answer there is that the

9

board's decision, its order that says, we deny

10

reopening, is wholly within the discretion of the board

11

and is unreviewable under Heckler v. Chaney.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So ­­ so you ­­ you say the

13

Fifth Circuit did not implicitly hold that there was no

14

review of ­­ of the statutory deadline period ­­

15

MR. PETERSON:

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

As we understand ­­
­­ because you think the

17

Fifth Circuit read the ­­ the board's decision, since it

18

came after the 90 days, to be a sua sponte decision and,

19

hence, nonreviewable.

20

But that's not consistent with their earlier

21

decisions, which said, we're going to interpret it this

22

way because we have no jurisdiction to do it if you

23

interpret it the other way.

24

I mean, they didn't say that, if it's after

25

the 90 days, the ­­ the board should consider it to be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

an appeal to its sua sponte authority.

2

we believe that ­­ that there is ­­ that there is no

3

extension of the 90­day period under the statute, in

4

order to help the Petitioner, we're going to interpret

5

it as a request for review of the sua sponte authority.

They said, since

6

Isn't that ­­ isn't that what they said.

7

MR. PETERSON:

Yes, Your Honor, but we see

8

the two as essentially indistinguishable.

9

Petitioner's request came after the expiration of the

Because the

10

90­day period, it could have been granted only through

11

the board's exercise of its sua sponte authority.

12

decision whether to grant or deny the board's exercise

13

of its sua sponte, in our view, is unreviewable.

14

And a

Let me point out one possible concern in

15

writing an opinion here.

16

As the Court's aware, prisoners can be quite creative in

17

attempting to circumvent the bar on second or successive

18

petitions under 2254 and 2255 and will frequently file

19

motions captioned under 2241 or possibly obscure common

20

law writs, seeking relief that's properly available

21

under 2254 or 2255.

22

And that's the habeas context.

In those circumstances, the district courts

23

will properly look at the merits of petitioner's

24

request, determine that it is a request that could truly

25

be granted only under 2254, 2255, and whatever the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

44
1

caption the prisoner has placed on it will enforce

2

AEDPA's jurisdictional bar.

3

And finally, with respect to merits of

4

equitable tolling, we would simply note that, in our

5

view, Justice Ginsburg, I believe the Fifth Circuit has

6

already determined that Petitioner's motion to reopen

7

was untimely.

8

to the Fifth Circuit without addressing anything other

9

than the jurisdictional question, the inevitable result

And in the event that the Court remands

10

in the Fifth Circuit would simply be to deny on the

11

merits, which is a result that would not lead to any

12

greater benefit for Petitioner.

13

If there are no further questions.

10

MR. FLEMING:

Our ­­ our position, Justice

Ginsburg, as laid out in our reply brief, is that this

that this Court recognized in Young that are advanced by

for a long time.

It serves the policies

20

None of that is inconsistent with tolling.
