ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE S. ISAACSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ISAACSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

The matter before the Court today concerns

13

the scope and application of the Tax Injunction Act, a

14

law passed by Congress in 1937 for the purpose of

15

preventing State taxpayers from circumventing

16

State­established and available procedures for

17

challenging State tax assessments and instead, going

18

directly to Federal court seeking to invoke the equity

19

powers of Federal courts to enjoin the assessment and

20

enforcement of State tax laws.

21

The matter before the Court is one of

22

statutory construction.

23

passed legislation that had three components to it.

24

was directed at exclusively out­of­State retailers and

25

required those retailers who made sales to Colorado

In 2010, the State of Colorado

Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official

4
1

residents and did not collect Colorado use tax to first

2

provide a transaction notice in connection with each

3

sale to a Colorado customer informing them of their

4

obligation to self­report the use tax to the Colorado

5

Department of Revenue; and then on an annual basis to

6

send a mailing to Colorado customers informing them of

7

all purchases that they made during the past year and,

8

again, reiterating the requirement that they inform the

9

Department of Revenue of their tax obligations; and

10

third, for those out­of­State retailers affected by the

11

law, to report to the Colorado Department of Revenue all

12

of the customer transaction information that occurred

13

during the past year for each Colorado customer.

14

The case has an interesting procedural

15

history which I think is of relevance both to the Tax

16

Injunction Act and also to the issue of comity.

17

executive director did not raise the Tax Injunction Act

18

at the district court level and did not challenge the

19

jurisdiction of the district court.

20

The

When the district court entered a permanent

21

injunction enjoining enforcement of the Colorado statute

22

and it was appealed by the executive director, the

23

executive director, in her briefing to the Tenth

24

Circuit, expressly informed the court that the Tax

25

Injunction Act and comity did not apply and were not a

Alderson Reporting Company

bar to the Federal appellate court proceeding to hear

2

the case.

3

When the appeal was made on a petition for

4

certiorari to this Court, in her brief in opposition to

5

the petition for certiorari, the executive director

6

explained that the reason that she did not raise the

7

jurisdictional issue below was because she favored

8

having an expedited hearing on this matter so that

9

the ­­

10
11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it often happens.

It's a jurisdictional issue.

12

MR. ISAACSON:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So what's the point?

Well ­­
I mean, the fact that she

14

didn't raise it is irrelevant.

15

she didn't raise it here, we would have to raise it

16

here, wouldn't we?

17

MR. ISAACSON:

In fact, even ­­ even if

I believe that certainly for

18

purposes of comity, Your Honor, the decision on the part

19

of the government to seek the resolution of the matter

20

in ­­ in a court is ­­ constitutes effectively a waiver

21

of ­­ of the comity question.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, the comity, okay.

And

23

you ­­ you agree it has nothing to do with the ­­ with

24

the principal question?

25

MR. ISAACSON:

No.

I believe that under the

Tax Injunction Act, if the State affirmatively seeks the

2

relief from the Court, that it ­­ it can ­­ it can

3

And in ­­ in this case, I think that it's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

MR. ISAACSON:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse ­­ if the ­­ if

Yes.

In this case ­­

The State would be seeking

to enjoin its own tax?

10

MR. ISAACSON:

What ­­ what the State ­­

11

State sought was a summary judgment.

12

moved for summary judgment at the district court level.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They affirmatively

Well, but that ­­ that just

14

means the district court should throw it out.

I mean,

But that wasn't the request

on summary judgment.

19

not to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds.

The summary judgement was a

waiver question.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Either way consent or ­­

you're suggesting is that the reason for the TIA is not

That's correct.

believe, Justice Sotomayor, that the Court has made

10

clear, including in the ­­ in the Fair Assessment case,

11

Fair Assessment v. McNary, that the Tax Injunction Act

12

is really a codified subset of the law of comity.

13

that the TIA did not supplant or replace comity, but

14

instead codified a certain element of comity.

3

appellate court and before this Court in the opposition

4

to the petition for certiorari of saying that this

5

Court ­­ that the reason why they decided to proceed was

6

they wanted an expedited hearing.

7

What I think it is remarkably reflective of

8

is the opinion or the view of the executive director

that the Tax Injunction Act does not apply to this

10

situation.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, that's ­­ that's

I ­­ I can understand that.

I agree, that's a good argument.

But you're arguing much beyond that.

terms, and what the Court is presented with is an issue

of statutory construction as construed by the executive

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Isaacson, can we get

12

to the nub of this question?

We have your petition, the

13

fact it is a restriction on the Court's jurisdiction.

14

But you recognize that the TIA does cover

15

regulations that require an employer to report an

16

employer's ­­ an employee's taxable income.

17

straight reporting requirement, and you recognize that

that's covered by the TIA.

That's a

Why ­­ why is it that the one comes under

which it was the taxpayer that was seeking to prevent

clear that in those cases it was doing so for the

attempting to prevent the issuance of that ­­ that

10

equivalent to the Federal W­2, requiring employers to

12

13

you think the result is in that case?

14

MR. ISAACSON:

And suppose the

In that case, I believe that

15

the Tax Injunction Act would bar ­­ the Tax Injunction

16

Act would not bar Federal court jurisdiction.

17

that that would be the classic situation that was

18

described by the Court in Levin v. Commerce Energy

19

where ­­

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think

So ­­ so you say the words

21

"assessment" and "levy" in the statute apply only to

22

taxpayers.

23

MR. ISAACSON:

No.

There are situations in

24

which there may be proxies that are acting on behalf of

25

the taxpayer so that you could have a situation, for ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

11

for example, where you have a successor in interest to a

2

taxpayer that may be bringing the claim.

3

those situations, they are ones in which ­­ and this is

4

the case law regarding the Tax Injunction Act ­­ that

5

they are all situations in which the taxpayer or the

6

person acting on behalf of the taxpayer is bringing an

action ­­

But in all of

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm sorry.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

My very point.

11

Go ahead.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

But ­­

So what?

The question is whether the

13

word "collection" includes an injunction that makes it

14

more difficult for the State to collect the tax.

15

the case that Justice Ginsburg brought up, the

16

injunction, because it would stop the ­­ the employer

17

from telling the State how much has been earned, would

18

make it more difficult to collect the tax.

And in

19

In this case, the injunction, by stopping

20

sellers from telling the State how much the Colorado

21

citizen has bought, would make it more difficult for

22

them to collect the tax.

23

the one case an injunction that makes it more difficult

24

to collect an income tax, why doesn't it in this case

25

include an injunction that makes it more difficult to

So if collection includes in

Alderson Reporting Company

1

collect a use tax?

2

conceptually.

3

The point was they are identical

Now, I don’t care whether it's ­­ who ­­

4

who brings the suit.

In terms of the word "collection,"

5

they seem identical.

Now, what is your response to that

6

question, which is what I think was being asked?

7

MR. ISAACSON:

So, Justice Breyer, I think

8

you have to read the word "injunction," which is the

9

first set of operative words ­­

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't say anywhere

"injunction."

12

MR. ISAACSON:

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Enjoin.
What the word is, "enjoin,"

14

"suspend" or "restrain."

15

you on those, but what you are enjoining, suspend ­­ you

16

are enjoining something.

17

says the State cannot enforce its provision requiring

18

out­of­State sellers to report what Colorado customers

19

buy.

20

I think you could deny that it enjoins the collection of

21

a tax.

22

to the question that Justice Ginsburg asked, and tell me

23

how to distinguish the two cases she mentioned.

24

one and the case where it's reporting income by an

25

in­State citizen.

And I get ­­ I'm totally with

There is an injunction that

I don't see how you can deny that's an injunction.

But to do that, you will have to go right back

Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official

13
1

MR. ISAACSON:

So the words "enjoin" and

2

"suspend" operate on the words "assessment," "levy" and

3

"collection."

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. ISAACSON:

Yes.
And as this Court ruled in

6

the ­­ in the Hibbs case, in which even though the Court

7

was divided on the issue of the meaning of the term

8

"assessment," which was the key issue in ­­ in that

9

case, that the assessment is the recording of liability.

10

And this Court also ruled in ­­ in ­­ in the

11

Hibbs case that assessment triggers collection.

12

the Tax Injunction Act, the word "collection" is

13

referring to actions of government officials following

14

the assessment of the tax.

15

that Your Honor is referring to is one which is relating

16

to the actions of third parties, private parties, not

17

government officials.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So in

And the injunction that ­­

So your point is that if,

19

in fact, there is in Colorado a law somewhat like

20

Federal law that says all employers must report to the

21

State the wages that in this Boulder area, or Denver, we

22

pay our employees and someone tries to enjoin that law

23

in Federal court, you are saying they can do it.

24

It doesn't matter whether it's use, out of the State or

25

employment within the State, and we simply have to

2

accept that consequence because of Hibbs.
MR. ISAACSON:

Well, in the W­2 concept,

3

what Justice Kagan was referring to, there's a tax

4

liability responsibility that the employer themselves

5

have, so that I think that a court might well conclude

6

that because of the obligation ­­

In that situation, I think if

it's a third party, that third party is an outsider as

this Court defined outsider, an individual whose own tax

11

liability is not of relevance.

12

context of the Tax Injunction Act, it's been

13

consistently been interpreted that ­­ that way, that all

14

of the cases that have been cited by the executive

15

director, whether those cases address specifically the

16

tax assessment or some liability, are all cases that

17

were brought by a taxpayer and the issue related to what

Right.

I think in Americans

2

interested in what its own status was.

3

in ­­ in addition to that, you had a ­­ an underlying

4

tax statute that was at issue.

5

question of eligibility for tax­exempt status.

6

But I think

The issue concerned the

What I think is significant in this case is

7

not only the fact that you have an obligation that is

8

not borne by taxpayers but is imposed exclusively on

9

non­taxpayers, but it also is not a tax statute.

10
11

It's a

statute that's ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But where ­­ where do you

12

get, Mr. Isaacson, this idea that the ­­ the plaintiff

13

has to be the taxpayer?

14

the statute does not say that.

15

speaks to what kinds of remedies a court can give.

16

does not speak to what kind of plaintiffs have to bring

17

the lawsuit.

18

MR. ISAACSON:

Because certainly the text of

I think the discussion of the

19

Tax Injunction Act in the Levin case, Levin v. Commerce

20

Energy, where a group is identified as outsiders,

21

individuals or entities whose own tax liability is not

22

of relevance to the ­­ to the case, is the source of ­­

23

of that authority.

24
25

And in this case, that's exactly the
situation that you have, that we're not talking about

16
1

the tax liability of out­of­State retailers.

2

liability is irrelevant.

3

out­of­State retailers are not challenging anyone's tax

liability, which I think is also a distinction from the

5

American United's case where they were ­­ they were

6

concerned about the tax liabilities of contributors to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Their tax

Furthermore, those

I guess I don't ­­ what I

don't understand about your statutory argument, I mean,

10

it seems a kind of natural thing for somebody to say

11

suppose it's like we're going to all have pizza tonight,

12

and we're going to take up a collection to buy the

13

pizza.

14

money for the pizza.

And I assign one of my clerks, go collect the

15

So what that clerk is going to do is he's

16

going to figure out who it is that's going to owe the

17

money, right?

18

who owes the money.

19

going to send an e­mail to those people and he's going

20

to say you owe this money for pizza.

21

if somebody doesn't pay, he's going to identify the

22

delinquent and ­­ and say, really, you owe this money

23

for pizza.

24
25

Who's going to partake of the pizza, so
And then, you know, maybe he's

And then if no ­­

So that's all part of the collection
process, isn't it?

I mean, basically, identifying ­­

17
1

informing the ­­ the people who have to pay, informing

2

the people who have to pay and identifying the people

3

who don't pay, and ­­ and the amounts that they owe.

4

MR. ISAACSON:

I think two responses,

5

Justice Kagan.

6

"assessment," "levy," and "collection" are terms of art

7

that have particular relevance in tax parlance, just as

8

the terms "enjoin," "suspend" have particular relevance

9

in regard to the Court's equity powers.

10

One, the terms "collection,"

So in this situation, what collection is

11

referring to, and it's consistent with how the Internal

12

Revenue Code treats the term "collection," it's the

13

action that is taken by tax authorities, by government

14

officials, after a determination of tax liability has

15

been made, after notice has been given to the taxpayer

16

of their obligation, and it's the efforts of the

17

government to then recover the amount of money which is

18

owed.

19

The fact that there may be information which

20

is of use, of relevance that may precede the collection

21

activity of the government doesn't convert those

22

preliminary activities into collection itself.

23

think what ­­ what is ­­ is really critical on this ­­

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I

But you're saying that

collection is only as the money changes hands, that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1
2

that's the only thing that constitutes collection?
MR. ISAACSON:

No.

What I'm saying is that

3

collection follows assessment, and after the assessment

4

has occurred, it is the activities of government

5

officials in order to recover money from taxpayers.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ so you're

7

saying it's just like garnishment or things like that?

8

It has to be focused on a specific amount that's already

9

been calculated and the taxpayer has not turned over?

10

MR. ISAACSON:

It ­­ it certainly goes far

11

beyond garnishment and would include any activities on

12

the part of government officials once the taxpayer's

13

liability has been determined.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you've got to

15

know that he or she owes $1,482 because they've done the

16

calculations and they haven't paid that over.

17

MR. ISAACSON:

Yes.

As ­­ as this Court

18

decided in the ­­ in the Hibbs case, the decision

19

written by Justice Ginsburg, it's assessment that

20

triggers collection, so that they ­­ they fall in

21

sequence to each other.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I'm not sure what ­­

23

what you have conceded.

24

MR. ISAACSON:

The fact that the State has

an interest in this information and much of the briefing

reason.

2

Essentially the State is saying we're not going to be

3

able to collect this tax unless we do these things,

4

unless we tell people that they, in fact, owe the tax

5

and unless we have a mechanism to make sure that people

6

who don't pay the tax are identified.

7

all these forms are all about.

9

It's importance to enable them to collect.

MR. ISAACSON:

And that's what

It's about collecting a

I'm not sure that the State

10

is saying they're not able to collect the tax absent

11

this information.

12

the revenue note that went with this was twelve and a half million

15

In fact, the anticipated revenue on

dollars, it was less than 2/10ths of 1 percent of the
total State ­­ State revenues.
But assuming for the moment that the State

16

does believe that this is important information,

17

valuable information, that doesn't mean that it fits

18

within the language of what was excluded by the Tax

Injunction Act from Federal court jurisdiction.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

in any case in which a ­­ a government goes about

That's how we're going to collect

I believe the ­­ I believe

the issue that the Court is confronted with is in the

construction of this statute in regard to what the

meaning of the word "collection" means in the context of

being associated with assessment, levy, and collection.

10

What is the act of collection?

of the State in being able to pursue collection, but

what is the act of collection that is enjoined.

challenges in State supreme courts, if they're ­­ if

So it is important that it begin in Federal court

when ­­ especially when what is at issue is the selfish

there is a real incentive on the part of the State

I would like to address three issues that

2

have been raised by Mr. Domenico.

3

primary concerns is the boundless nature of the test

that has been suggested by the executive secretary, and

5

I believe that it's boundless in two regards:

12

limitation on what that scope may be, even though that

14

issue, nor may it have any interest in any other party's

15

tax liability.

There is ­­ there is no

any activity that might ­­ might facilitate.

20

really is, again, no limitation on what the kind of

21

request for information might be that could be imposed

22

by the standard that's been suggested.

23

24

that kind of expansive, unbounded reach.

25

The Tax

Much to the contrary, as Justice Ginsburg

Alderson Reporting Company

So there

Official

49
1

has pointed out, the purpose was to require taxpayers

2

who want to challenge their tax assessments to have to

3

go through State procedures that have been established,

4

which usually were the payment of the tax and bringing a

5

suit for refund, and not to employ Federal court equity

6

jurisdiction.

7

The ­­ the difference between the original

8

purpose of the Tax Injunction Act and its proposed use

9

by the State of Colorado is immense.

10

Second, Mr. Domenico said that he believed

11

that absent this information, it effectively would make

12

it impossible for the State of Colorado to be able to

13

pursue use tax collection.

14

But I believe it's interesting to note that

15

the State of Colorado has not employed many of the

16

measures that other States have employed to collect use

17

taxes.

18

19

reporting of ­­ of State taxes, or you can have
