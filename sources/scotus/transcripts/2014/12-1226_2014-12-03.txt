ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL BAGENSTOS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BAGENSTOS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

If Peggy Young had sought an accommodation

12

for a 20­pound lifting restriction that resulted from

13

any number of conditions, whether acquired on or off the

14

job, the summary judgment record reflects that UPS would

15

have granted that accommodation.

16

Young's 20­pound lifting restriction resulted from her

17

pregnancy and not from one of those conditions, UPS

18

rejected her request.

19

of the second clause of the PDA which, if it means

20

anything, must mean that when an employee seeks an

21

accommodation or benefit due to her pregnancy, that she

22

is entitled to the same accommodation that her employer

23

would have given her.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But because Peggy

That, we submit, is a violation

Well, what you make it

sound as if the only condition that was not accommodated

was a lifting restriction because of pregnancy, and I ­­

2

I did not understand that to be the case.

3

that's the way you start.

4

say it's only pregnancy, unless I've ­­ I've missed

5

something.

6

MR. BAGENSTOS:

I mean,

You want ­­ you want me to

Well, I ­­ so I think on the

7

summary judgment record here, Your Honor, that the three

8

very broad classes of ­­ of limitations that UPS

9

accommodates do ­­ at least there's a genuine issue of

10

material fact that they cover the waterfront of

11

everything but pregnancy.

12

those three broad classes by themselves, even if there

13

are some conditions out there, that they don't cover

14

create ­­

15
16
17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But our position is that

I'm sorry.

I'm

confused.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I mean, I think

18

that's a necessary starting point for your case.

19

seems to me that you started out by really giving a

20

misimpression.

21

MR. BAGENSTOS:

It

Well, I ­­ Your Honor, I

22

would submit that that's not right.

23

in ­­ on this summary judgment record, UPS had ­­ UPS

24

acknowledges that they provide accommodations to people

25

with on­the­job injuries, but also the summary ­­ but

Alderson Reporting Company

I would submit that

Official

5
1

also the summary judgment record shows that UPS provides

2

accommodations to drivers with off­the­job injuries that

3

result in DOT disqualification, and UPS has not been

4

able to point to a single driver who has a lifting

5

restriction similar to my client, Peggy Young's, who

6

didn't get accommodated who was not pregnant.

7

I think ­­

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So ­­ so

Mr. Bagenstos, what would

your case be if ­­ let's accept, for argument's sake,

10

that there's a category people who are injured off duty

11

who do not get light work assignments.

12

pointed to three large categories that do, but let's

13

suppose one category doesn't.

14

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Yes.

So you ­­ you

So in that case, our

15

position would be, as the plain text of the statute

16

demands, that the employer would be required to treat

17

the pregnant plaintiff the same as those classes of

18

employees who get accommodations ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

treatment.

21

MR. BAGENSTOS:

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So ­­
It doesn't have to be read

23

that way.

24

could ­­ it could also mean that if you give it to

25

employees generally, you have to give it to pregnant

It ­­ it could be read that way, and it

employees, although there may be special ­­ special

2

classes.

3

about, you know, if ­­ if you have your ­­ your senior

4

employees driven to work when ­­ when ­­ when they are

5

unable to drive themselves, you have to do the same for

6

pregnant women.

I think one of the briefs had an example

Would you say that that's the case?

7

MR. BAGENSTOS:

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. BAGENSTOS:

No, we would not say that.
Why not?
We would ­­ we would

10

not say that because our position is that the statutory

11

text requires that employers provide workers who are

12

disabled by pregnancy the same treatment they would

13

receive if they themselves had a similar ­­ had a

14

condition with a similar effect on the ability to work,

15

but that had a different source.

16

So what the statute prohibits is

17

discrimination based on the source of the workplace

18

limitation, not based on seniority, not based on

19

position within the company.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

But suppose you have a ­­
Justice Breyer.
Suppose ­­ I mean, we have

23

a brief, as you've seen it, from the truck drivers,

24

and ­­ and they say they don't give many of these

25

benefits to anybody.

And suppose they do, though, give

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

a benefit to a truck driver who has driven over a

2

particularly difficult mountain pass, you know, where ­­

3

and gotten himself in some danger.

4

the harm or the disability is lifting precisely the

5

same.

6

see, this came from taking a ­­ some truck that ­­ doing

7

something special with it, and, again, it's a kind of

8

most favored nation problem.

9

gets you out of it.

10

Now, the ­­ the ­­

It's just that the source was different.

You

I don't know that source

Is ­­ is ­­ what do you say about

that?

11

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So I ­­ I think as to that,

12

the ­­ the important point is that ­­ that is an example

13

of what may be an idiosyncratic decision by an employer

14

to provide an accommodation to a particular employee.

15

think, as Justice Scalia ­­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

Well, I don't know that

17

it's idiosyncratic, you see, because I don't know all

18

the workplaces, and I can imagine that employers have

19

all kinds of different rules for different kinds of

20

jobs.

21

is one job in respect to which, let's say, they give

22

them benefits of $1,000 a week when you're hurt on this

23

job but not on others ­­

And ­­ and is ­­ are you saying as long as there

24

MR. BAGENSTOS:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so ­­
­­ then do you have to give

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

them to all pregnant women who hold different jobs?

2

Now, I think the answer to that must be no, but the

3

problem for that and for you is how do you distinguish

4

your situation from that?

5

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Right.

And I ­­ and I think

6

actually what Justice Scalia's question to me a minute

7

ago ­­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. BAGENSTOS:

10

Yes.
­­ actually contains the

seeds of the answer to that.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Exactly.
So ­­ so it seems to me I

13

might agree that an employer that provides a

14

particularly good deal to a single nonpregnant employee

15

doesn't set a ­­

16
17
18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not a single.

There's a

class of people.
MR. BAGENSTOS:

For a small ­­ right.

So ­­

19

so ­­ but when you have an employer that provides to a

20

large class, to ­­ to its employees generally, to many

21

of its employees, this accommodated work treatment ­­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

I see ­­ I see that that ­­

23

now, it sounds ­­ the other question I have, and it's the

24

only other one, is it did seem to me there is a way,

25

given your theory it's a quite easy way for you to win,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

9
1

and that would be to bring a disparate impact claim, and

2

that's what I thought disparate impact claims were

3

about.

4

MR. BAGENSTOS:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

So ­­
But you didn't bring the

6

disparate claim and, therefore, what am I to do because

7

I don't know that you want to twist the disparate, you

8

know, intent claim out of shape when you have such a

9

beautiful vehicle to bring a claim of the kind you just

10

articulated.

11

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think the vehicle to

12

bring the claim of the kind that I articulated is the

13

second clause of the PDA.

14

says that, "Women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or

15

related conditions shall be treated the same as other

16

persons not so affected but similar in their ability or

17

inability to work."

The second clause of the PDA

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN :

Could that take ­­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

You read that as an

Well, you read that as a ­­

21

accommodation provision basically, and maybe ­­ maybe it

22

is.

23

the ­­ the issue of ­­ of whether the types of

24

accommodations that you would say are required have to

25

meet some reasonableness standard.

But let me ask you this question, which goes to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

10
1

Let's say there are two categories of

2

employees who have lifting restrictions in their job

3

descriptions.

4

they lift all the time.

5

by herself and has to lift heavy packages all the time

6

would fall into that category.

7

would consist of people who lift more occasionally, and

8

they do it in a place where there will always be lots of

9

other employees in the same class available to do the

10

One consists of people who work alone and
A driver who is driving a truck

The second category

lifting.

11

Now, if an accommodation is provided to the

12

workers in the second category, would you say that one

13

must also be provided to workers in the first?

14

MR. BAGENSTOS:

15

So our point is precisely that a driver who

No, I don't think so.

16

is pregnant and who has a limitation related to her

17

pregnancy is entitled to the same accommodation her

18

employer would have given her if she had sought it for a

19

different medical condition with the same effect on the

20

ability to work.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why ­­ why doesn't that

22

fit ­­ why doesn't that second class fit within your

23

reading of the statutory text?

24
25

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, so because, in our ­­

in our view, the statutory text, by saying ­­ by drawing

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

this distinction between employees affected by

2

pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions

3

and not so affected, saying employers can't draw that

4

distinction, excuse me, and saying instead they look

5

only at the ability to work, what it does is it

6

prohibits discrimination based on the source of the

7

disabling condition.

8

based on different job classifications.

9

It doesn't prohibit discrimination

If you have a driver ­­ if an employer says

10

no driver who drives alone is going to get an

11

accommodation whether for an on­the­job injury, a DOT

12

disqualifying injury, or pregnancy, that's fine because

13

it's the same treatment.

14

not read this statute as an independent, reasonable

15

accommodation ­­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because, Justice Alito, we do

But why then ­­ I guess I'm

17

not quite understanding why you can ­­ get the source

18

classifications into a different category from all other

19

classifications.

20

So explain that to me.

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, so, I mean, I think

21

it ­­ it goes to the statutory text.

22

statutory text says, "Women affected by pregnancy,

23

childbirth, or related medical conditions shall be

24

treated the same," et cetera, "as other persons not so

25

affected but similar in their ability to work."

Alderson Reporting Company

So, I mean, the

Official

What that ­­ what that text is saying is ­­

to an employer, don't consider whether this person is

5

other employees.

6

on ability to work.

7

That's not

Instead, compare this employee based

And remember, this statutory text was

8

adopted in response to General Electric v. Gilbert which

9

upheld an employer policy that distinguished based on

10

the source of the disabling condition, treated some

11

kinds of disabling conditions differently from

12

pregnancy­related disabling conditions.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think you're

14

reading ­­ you have admitted that other persons can't

15

really be read literally.

16

things into it.

17

the same job classification.

18

then why can't you also read into it people whose

19

injuries, whose disabilities have the same source?

20

Other ­­ you have to read

And you would read into it people in

MR. BAGENSTOS:

But if you can do that,

Because once you do that,

21

then the second clause of the PDA doesn't occupy any

22

space and then ­­ and Congress should have stopped with

23

the first clause.

25

situation, where you had an employer that adopted a

5

6

7

Gilbert case was that's not discrimination; it ­­ it

9

pregnant women aren't fenced off.

10

If you were

And what this Court said in the

No, employers have to treat pregnancy­related conditions

as favorably as they treat nonpregnancy­related

the statute since it's very first PDA case.

15

News, what this Court said was that the Act makes clear

16

that it's discriminatory to treat pregnancy­related

17

conditions less favorably than other medical conditions.

18

And here UPS, with the three very large classes of

19

employees that it provides accommodations to who are not

20

pregnant, is treating pregnancy­related conditions less

21

favorably than other medical conditions.

22

And that's in fact how this Court has read

JUSTICE SCALIA:

have presented examples in the record of individuals who

You can win your case with

that argument, perhaps.

14

MR. BAGENSTOS:

And I hope so, yes.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, assume that.

16

But that

isn't going to help me, which I'm rather selfish about.

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because my ­­ my job here

19

is to write what this statute means for a lot of cases.

20

And writing the words, what it means is if you give a

21

lot of benefits to a lot of employees, but not to the

22

pregnant women and you don't give it to some employees

23

and not to the pregnant women, and the employer says,

24

look, pregnant women are like the few we don't give it

25

to, not to the lot we do give it to, employer, you lose.

the important point is if an employer provides

10

ability or inability to work to the pregnant plaintiff

And the reason we think that that's the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, but you start ­­

you've got ­­ at the very beginning, you listed three

things that you said were reasonable distinctions.

Because the word I'd like you to focus on is "other

workers" and the problem is which other workers?

11

Because it is easy to construct hypothetical cases where

12

the work ­­ the employer treats some other workers the

same as the statute and doesn't others.

14

distinctions are reasonable and which ones are not, and

how do we tell?

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And which

I'd like to make two

points in response, Justice Breyer.

nature of the Title VII claim and the second about the

19

nature of this kind of an antidiscrimination provision.

The first about the

20

With respect to the first, I think it's

21

helpful to differentiate between a direct claim of

22

discrimination, disparate treatment, versus a claim

23

proven through the McDonnell Douglas framework.

24

think in order to prove a direct claim without going

25

through the McDonnell Douglas burden­shifting analysis,

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, we

Official

24
1

what you've got to show is that an employer offers an

2

accommodation to a significant class of employees and

3

that that accommodation fails the test I described

4

earlier.

5

It's got to be a significant class.

Now, we think that's this case.

We think

6

that's going to be most cases.

examples that Your Honor identified, the one guy driving

8

across the mountain, for example, I think you'd have two

But in the kinds of

First, when it's one person, you're not

going to be able to make a direct case.

explanation for that accommodation that would take it

13

outside the source of the disability limitation and mean

14

there's no liability.

15

You go through

And then with respect to that example

16

there's a second point to be made, I think, which is

that that person who has to drive the particularly

different job category and, therefore, not similar in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I would have thought

it's those types of cases that present the starkest

thought maybe it's the ­­ the sort of the isolated

3

examples that would be particularly glaring in their

4

discriminatory treatment.

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I

Well, Mr. Chief Justice,

6

I guess what I would say about that is that you could

7

certainly bring a McDonnell Douglas claim against an

8

individual idiosyncratic difference, but then if the

9

employer can show that the accommodation was granted to

10

one not on the basis of a criterion that this sentence

11

in the PDA would forbid, then the employer's ­­ then

12

the ­­ then the accommodation is fine, there's no

13

violation.

14

And to get back to the point ­­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's the ­­ that's ­­ I

16

used the idiosyncratic example, not because I'm

17

interested in it, because I think it illustrates

18

something that isn't idiosyncratic.

19

to illustrate is the fact that, as here, employers will

20

have classes of people and the classes may be based on

21

all kinds of different things.

22

there are classes and some get the benefits equivalent

23

to the pregnancy and some don't.

Yes, of course.

Let me

6

get to the second point I wanted to make in response to

7

your question, and then I'll try, after I do that, to

8

give you a very specific response to what you just asked

9

me.

10

The second point is, you know, it is true

11

that some classes are going to be in and some classes

are going to be out, but that's how discrimination law

operates.

14

women in promotions, the fact that an employer is also

15

discriminating against overweight men in promotions

16

doesn't make the discrimination against women any less

actionable because it just reflects the choice Congress

made about whom to protect and whom not to protect.

here, the choice Congress made on whom to protect and

whom not to protect is the choice to protect women who

21

with that, wouldn't you?

22

MS. HALLIGAN:

And I think you would agree

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

23

The reading that we propose is very straightforward.

24

What Congress said in the second clause, the key words

25

are "the same as other persons."

What "other" means is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30

simply distinct from whatever is mentioned first.

2

employers have to treat pregnant employees the same as

some distinct group of nonpregnant employees that are

exactly what UPS's policy is.

This Court explained in

14

apply to pregnancy.

15

that was in order to repudiate the logic ­­

16

And the reason that they had to do

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So ­­ so you are saying it's

17

not doing anything new; it's only explaining the old

18

stuff.

And okay.

Tell me why that's necessary?

MS. HALLIGAN:

I'm not ­­ I'm not saying

20

that, Your Honor.

21

pregnancy discrimination case, instead of comparing

22

women with men as you would in a typical sex

23

discrimination case, because what the first clause does

24

is bolt pregnancy on to sex discrimination.

25

you compare women and men in a pregnancy discrimination

What I'm saying is that in a

Alderson Reporting Company

And so if

case where you have a policy that facially discriminates

against pregnancy, you will nonetheless conclude that

there's not sex discrimination because there will be

women who are pregnant in the disfavored group, but

5

there will also be women who are not pregnant in the

6

favored group, along with men

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think, again, that that is

8

not necessary, because all that the inquiry would be is

9

were you discriminated against because you were

pregnant?

12

is.

is that when you look at a policy that discriminates on

disparate treatment of intentional discrimination.

13

it's distinct, I think, from a disparate impact case

where, as here, you have a facially neutral policy, a

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL BAGENSTOS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BAGENSTOS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

So I'd like to begin, if I could, with the

2

facts, because Justice Alito did ask, and, yes, we

3

certainly do disagree with UPS's ­­ UPS's assertion

4

here.

5

point correctly to some very general statements in the

6

record by UPS managers that they never authorized these

7

accommodations.

8

in the record of people with off­the­job injuries or

9

illnesses who were DOT decertified who were given

This case was on summary judgment and UPS does

trial.

14

That's a factual dispute that has to go to

JUSTICE ALITO:

You really think that you

15

could prove at trial that if somebody is injured in a

16

recreational activity over the weekend that they get

17

light duty but a pregnant women does not maybe?

18

MR. BAGENSTOS:

So if someone is injured

19

over the weekend in a way that leads them to be DOT

20

decertified, yes, and in fact, the UPS manager so

21

testified about his sports injury.

22

opening brief.

23

We cite that in our

So yes, we think so.

The second point I'd like to make is about

24

what the two clauses do, and I think this is very

25

important.

So the first clause of the PDA, as this

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

Court has said in Newport News and Cal Fed, overturns

2

the reasoning in General Electric v. Gilbert.

3

the first clause says is where Gilbert said, look,

4

discrimination based on pregnancy isn't sex

5

discrimination because there are pregnant women and

6

non­pregnant persons, that's wrong instead because a

7

pregnancy is because of sex definitionally.

8

what the second clause does, that's what the first

9

clause does.

10

So what

That's not

The second clause, as this Court said again

11

in Newport News and Cal Fed, goes further and overrules

12

the holding.

13

correct in describing the facts of Gilbert, that the

14

Gilbert holding would not be overturned by ­­ under

15

UPS's reading here because the Gilbert policy, the one

16

thing we know that Congress meant to say was illegal,

17

the Gilbert policy itself acted, drew lines in

18

pregnancy­neutral ways.

And I think Justice Kagan was exactly

19

It said if you have an off­the­job injury or

20

accident, defined as an off­the­job illness or accident

21

defined as an accidental injury, then you get disability

22

benefits.

23

and pregnancy isn't an accident in the sense of an

24

accidental injury.

25

Congress was trying to do, because Congress said it and

It just so happens pregnancy isn't an illness

And what Congress ­­ we know

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

this Court has said it, is to overturn the holding

2

there.

3

But UPS's rule simply reprices the rule at

4

issue in Gilbert.

5

Justice Breyer's made a couple of times at various points

6

If I might return to the point

in the argument­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Actually I think the

8

reverse.

The second sentence is what does that.

The

9

second sentence says you don't worry about whether it's

10

between sexes.

11

of people, people who are injured off­duty, are being

12

treated differently when they have the same ability to

13

work.

14

You worry about whether the same class

MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, I think, Justice

15

Sotomayor, the first clause says you don't worry about

16

whether they're the same sex or not.

17

­­

18
19
20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't look at

No, you do have to worry

about it because it still has to be sex discrimination.
MR. BAGENSTOS:

Well, no.

But the first

21

clause definitionally defines pregnancy discrimination

22

as sex discrimination.

23

because of pregnancy, that is because of sex.

24

that's the ­­ that's overturning the Gilbert reasoning

25

coming from Geduldig that pregnancy discrimination isn't

It says if you're discriminating

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

2

sex discrimination.
The second clause goes further, as this

3

Court's explained, and overturns the holding, overturns

4

the holding upholding the General Electric policy.

5

so ­­ and I think under ­­ under UPS's rule it wouldn't

6

do that.

And

7

On Justice Breyer's question, basically how

8

do we deal with a world where there's an employer that

9

treats two different groups of people who are

10

non­pregnant differently?

11

same" mean shall be treated the same as those who get

12

the better deal or those who get the worst deal; right?

13

Does "shall be treated the

And I think Justice Ginsburg and Justice

14

Kagan I think articulated this well, that their position

15

really would give least favored nation status to

16

pregnant workers and we know that that can't be

17

something that Congress intended.

18

because of what General Verrilli said, that that's not

19

how anti­discrimination law works, the fact that someone

20

else was discriminated against doesn't mean I lose.

21

We know that in part

Justice Alito's opinion for the Third

22

Circuit in the Fraternal Order of Police of Newark case

23

articulates the same rule.

24

the purpose of this statute is to say to employers, as

25

Justice Kagan said, you have to treat pregnant workers

We know that as well because
