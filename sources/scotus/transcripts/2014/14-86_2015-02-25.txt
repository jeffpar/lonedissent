Mr. Gershengorn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Tenth Circuit imposed two requirements

12

on religious accommodation claims that eliminated

13

liability for Respondent's refusal to accommodate

14

Ms. Elauf here:

15

verbally requested the accommodation; and second, that

16

the employer know, rather than just correctly

17

understand, the need for an accommodation.

First, that the applicant herself

18

Neither required ­­

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand.

20

is the difference between knowing and correctly

21

understanding?

22

MR. GERSHENGORN:

What

Your Honor, the

23

testimony ­­ it ­­ it's a fair question.

24

Circuit perceived a difference.

25

was that Ms. Cooke assumed that the ­­ that Ms. Elauf

The Tenth

What the testimony was

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

needed to wear the headscarf because she was religious,

2

that she figured that the headscarf signified that it

3

was a religious headscarf, and that she figured it was a

4

religious headscarf.

5

that was insufficient; what was needed was actual

6

knowledge.

7

What the Tenth Circuit said was

Our position is that when you figure, when

8

you assume, when you ­­ when it signifies to you that a

9

religious accommodation is needed, that is sufficient

10

notice for an employer to be on notice.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, suppose ­­
Does that subjective ­­

Does that subjective or ­­ is it even

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Whether

I mean, that's

That's right, Your Honor.

19

And we think that's what makes this a particularly

20

straightforward case.

21

act upon the assumption that Ms. Elauf needed to wear

22

the headscarf for religious reasons, and yet that it

23

later claimed refuge that it didn't have sufficient

knowledge or certainty to actually have initiated the

accommodation process that Congress wanted in Section

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But getting back to

3

Justice Scalia's question, I think there's some

4

substantial force to your argument that the employee

5

doesn't have to mention this first.

6

But why ­­ why do we ­­ import the term

7

understand instead of know.

8

whole idea is that ­­ that prohibited action was taken

9

because of religion.

10
11

In a treatment case, the

It's what you knew.

Why ­­ why

are you making it so confusing?
MR. GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, I ­­ with

12

respect to ­­ it's our position it's the Tenth Circuit

13

that's made it confusing.

14

done is said when you know ­­

15

What the Tenth Circuit has

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Your position ­­ your

16

statement that you opened with is ­­ is that he must

17

understand.

18

Justice Scalia asked you what ­­ why you did that, and I

19

can't understand your answer.

20

You stay away from the word "know".

MR. GERSHENGORN:

And

So the answer, Your Honor,

21

is we think that there is sufficient knowledge, notice,

22

when somebody understands that ­­ when somebody assumes

23

that a practice is religious and then acts upon it, that

24

that is sufficient.

25

What the Tenth Circuit said was that is not

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

sufficient, that what is needed is something more

2

approaching certainty.

3

If that's not ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Gershengorn, I

4

mean, so that does raise the question if yours is less

5

than certainty, how much less than certainty is it?

6

mean, suppose I'm an employer, and I say, you know, I

7

don't honestly know, I think.

8

three.

9

I

You know, it's two out of

Is that sufficient?

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I think

10

that if I could explain how these cases come up, I think

11

it will ­­ the best way to answer your ­­ it would be

12

the best way to answer your question.

13

The answer is, in a situation like this in

14

which it's an applicant applying for a ­­ a position,

15

and the employer suspects, thinks, two­thirds, that

16

there's a religious problem ­­ the ­­ a religious

17

conflict, the employer has two options.

18

there is no conflict, in which case they ­­ they make

19

the hiring decision on the merits.

20

Ms. Elauf would have been hired.

21

It can assume

In that case here,

Alternatively, if the employer feels like

22

there's enough concern to ­­ about how Ms. Elauf would

23

be able to perform, they can raise ­­ start a dialogue.

24

That's what ­­ what Congress intended.

25

do is what they did here and assume through a stereotype

6
Alderson Reporting Company

What they can't

Official

1

that there was going to be a need for accommodation, and

2

then say, having assumed that, I don't have any

3

obligation to actually try to accommodate that.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

No.

You're

promoting ­­

7

Go ahead.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Is that true even if it's ­­

under 50 percent?

Is that true even if it's

In other words, say that employer

10

says, you know, I really don't know, but I think

11

there's, like, a 50/50 chance or even a 40 percent

12

chance that this person has a religious ­­ that ­­ has

13

religious ­­ that this practice is religious.

14

don't really feel like getting into all this

15

accommodation stuff, so I'm not going to hire this

16

person.

17
18
19
20

MR. GERSHENGORN:

And I

So I think, Your Honor,

that that's what they cannot do.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I do think ­­

So it doesn't really depend

on what the percentage chance is.

21

MR. GERSHENGORN:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I think ­­
It could be certain, it

23

could be less than certain, it could be a lot less than

24

certain, as long as the employer says there's some

25

chance, and I'm not going to hire, or promote, or fire,

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

or whatever, because of that chance.
MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I ­­ I

3

would like to try to separate out two different ­­ two

4

different situations that a ­­ could arise, only one of

5

which we think arises commonly.

6

employer has a work rule and is concerned that the

7

applicant before it won't be able to comply in the

8

future with the ­­ after being hired, with the work

9

rule, because they perceive that the person is

10
11

One is that the

religious.
I think the dilemma that Your Honor is

12

posing is really a false one there.

13

really has a very small in ­­ understanding or thinks

14

there's ­­ it's very unlikely that the employee would be

15

religious, the right thing for the employer to do is to

16

assume that there's isn't a religious problem, to not

17

engage in the stereotyping and assume that the person

18

could comply as they would with somebody who was wearing

19

a headscarf or something else for not religious reasons.

20
21
22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If the employer

I'm not sure I

understand why you're fighting Justice Kagan's question.
Isn't the issue the reason that they acted?

23

They refused to hire someone because they had a

24

1 percent belief that they had a religious ­­ pardon the

25

pun ­­ a religious belief that they wouldn't

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

accommodate?
MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I don't

3

intend to fight Justice Kagan's hypothetical, and on the

4

facts of this case, I think it's really quite easy.

5

the reason why I'm trying to separate the two is because

6

I think the situation here is the easy case, and I'll

7

get to why the hard case and why I'm sort of fighting

8

Justice Kagan.

What ­­ what

So, Your Honor, the test

20

that the courts of appeals have adopted for more than

21

two decades, which is the test that we ask this Court to

22

adopt, is that the employer needs sufficient information

23

from any source about the employee ­­ about the

That

doesn't make any sense to me.
MR. GERSHENGORN:

But, Your Honor, the

11

reason why I think it makes sense in this case is

12

because if it's sufficient knowledge for you to actually

13

act upon it ­­ remember, if they ­­ if ­­ the critical

14

point here for us is if they had not ­­ if the employer

15

had not assumed that this was religious, had not

believed it, they would have hired her.

hypothetical points out quite nicely the ­­ that it's

hard question that I think Justice Kagan was asking, and

3

I do think that's a trickier question.

4

If your policy is not I have a work rule

5

that I'm concerned you won't be able to comply with in

6

the future, then I think, for all the reasons I've said

7

thus far, it's all said.

8

If the question is when someone comes to my

9

office with a beard and I just think they're ­­ it's

10

unkempt, I don't like it, I'm not going to hire them

two­thirds.

You could avoid those hard

And, Justice Ginsburg, to pick up on your

11

point, what makes it particularly inappropriate, I

12

think, to put the burden on the applicant here is that

13

it's the employer who gets to structure the interview.

14

And, in fact, the employer here read some version of the

15

Look Policy, but did not mention the headscarfs.

16

So, actually, this was a situation in which

17

the employer itself could have put Elauf on notice, and

18

then it's a very different situation.

19

says, we don't allow headscarfs, and then ­­ and then

the employee doesn't say anything, I think that's a very

Although part of the answer is that I don't think

15

the right approach for the employer who really wants to

16

avoid the subject is to assume that the person of Middle

17

Eastern descent, just like the person not of Middle

Eastern descent, has a beard for personal preference and

19

would be happy to shave if he got the job in order to

That

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR.

DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court;
The premise of the EEOC's argument today, as

5

I understand it, is that Abercrombie acted because of

6

the religious basis for Ms. Elauf's headscarf.

7

That is not correct as a factual matter; and

8

the EEOC's theory, in its brief, does not depend on any

9

such assumption.

The EEOC's theory in its brief is that

10

anytime an employer suspects a possible conflict or

11

correctly understands such a conflict, at that point it

12

is on notice and must offer a religious accommodation.

13

And so if you imagine a situation, which is

14
15

not at all ­­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They don't have to offer

16

a religious accommodation if they have a reasonable

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Sotomayor, as ­­ as

Their position is,

You know, we don't permit

an initial matter, their theory in their brief does not

12

depend on any sort of assumption about whether the

13

applicant would later be able to comply with the work

14

rule or not.

15

Under the theory expressed in their brief,

16

even if an employer like Abercrombie had a policy in

17

which the Look Policy applied at the interview, you are

18

being assessed at the interview based on your compliance

19

with our dress ­­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that the ­­ do

21

you think that the employee has to say, I am dressed the

way I am for a religious reason?

23

MR. DVORETZKY:

Not necessarily.

However,

24

the employer's knowledge has to be traced to the

25

employee in some way.

In the typical case, that is

30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

going to come directly from the employee because of the

2

individualized and personal nature of religion ­­

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

Let's say

4

four ­­ four people show up for a job interview at

5

Abercrombie.

7

And half ­­ this is going to sound like a
joke, but, you know, it's not.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So the first is a Sikh man

10

11

12

fourth is a Catholic nun in a habit.

13

Now, do you think the employer has to ­­

14

that those people have to say, we just want to tell you,

15

we're dressed this way for a religious reason.

16

not just trying to make a fashion statement.

17

MR. DVORETZKY:

We're

First of all, Your Honor,

18

one aspect of your hypothetical is not a joke; and that

19

is, that many of these interviews at Abercrombie are, in

20

fact, group interviews.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22

MR. DVORETZKY:

23

And I think ­­
Are the what?

Group?

Group ­­ group interviews

where there are mul­ ­­ multiple applicants at a time.

24

And so I think the reality is, it's a lot

25

more difficult than the government imagines to start

31
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

having these individualized dialogues.

2

But going to your point about those sorts

3

of religious outfits, one can certainly imagine cases

4

in which it is more obvious than others that a

5

particular ­­ a particular garb is likely worn for

6

religious purposes.

7

However, I would direct the Court, if I

8

could, to Joint Appendix 130 and 131, which contain

9

pictures of the sort of headscarf that Ms. Elauf was

10
11

actually wearing in this case.
Those sorts of situations where it's far

12

more ambiguous whether a ­­ whether a particular outward

13

symbol is religious in nature or not will be far more

14

common.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that can be the case,

16

but I want to know the answer to the question whether

17

the employee has to say, I'm wearing this for a

18

religious reason, or whether you're willing to admit

19

that there are at least some circumstances in which the

20

employer is charged with that knowledge based on what

21

the employer observes.

22

MR. DVORETZKY:

No, Your Honor.

I think

23

there are some circumstances in which it is certainly

24

more likely than others, but the question before the

25

Court is to devise a rule that's going to apply across

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

the board.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Actually, I didn't think

3

that was the question.

4

was that the Tenth Circuit had said, Employer, unless

5

you know from the woman who is applying, from the

6

applicant, unless you receive direct, explicit notice

7

that what she wants to wear is based on religion and she

8

wants an accommodation, unless you receive direct,

9

explicit notice from her, you're home free to do what

10

I thought the question presented

you want.

11

Now, in their question presented, they say,

12

in the last few words in describing it, we think that's

13

wrong.

14

Now, I agree that we have to say whether

15

that's wrong and, if it is wrong, it would be helpful to

16

say what they have to do.

17

it is.

18

understands, and I would add "or correctly believes"

19

that a practice is religious and an accommodation is

20

necessary, that's it.

So the SG says, here is what

If the employer correctly infers, correctly

MR. DVORETZKY:

Then he has to accommodate unless

What's wrong with that?
Justice Breyer, I think

what you've just described is a rule for all cases and

What ­­ why is that unadministrable?

the employer knows it to an absolute certainty, right?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Absolutely, because in that

situation, because what's relevant is the employer's

25

intent.

If the employer intends to discriminate on the

basis of religion, then that's a Title VII violation.

2

What's going on here, however, is that the employer

3

seeks to apply a religion­neutral dress code.

4

according to Johnson ­­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Religion,

Except in Title VII, you

6

would be right if all that Title VII did was prevent

7

religious discrimination, but it makes a religious

8

practice, a refusal to accommodate a religious practice

9

is itself a violation of Title VII.

10

So we have ­­ it's ­­ and that was done

11

deliberately, was it not, so that religious practices

12

would have to be accommodated.

13

MR. DVORETZKY:

Yes, Your Honor, and two

14

points in response to that, if I may.

15

contending that religious practices don't have to be

16

accommodated.

17

matter is that an employer does not intentionally

18

discriminate on the basis of a religious practice by

19

enforcing a religion­neutral dress code that would have

been have been enforced ­­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One, we're not

What we are contending as an initial

But the thing about my

22

question was, is that what this statute does is to say

23

that if you are, in fact, wearing a headscarf for

24

religious reasons, that your neutral policy really

25

doesn't matter, it only matters if you ­­ if there's an

undue burden and you really can't make an accommodation,

2

but except for that, it really doesn't matter.

3

have to hire me, even if I'm wearing a headscarf.

4

so the fact that you don't know that I'm wearing a

5

headscarf for religious reasons, that you only kind of

6

assume that, because most people do wear headscarves for

7

religious reasons, it shouldn't make any more difference

8

than in the hypothetical that I gave.

9

MR. DVORETZKY:

You just
And

Your Honor, on ­­ on that

10

logic, it also would make no difference if the employer

11

had absolutely no idea that the headscarf was worn for

12

religious reasons, because it would still be a religious

13

headscarf and a religious practice.

14

is claiming that there's a duty to accommodate in that

15

situation.

16

what level of knowledge does the employer have to have

17

before the duty to accommodate is triggered.

based on assumptions about Ms. Elauf's religion.

4

think one way in which we know that is, let's assume

5

that the Look Policy did apply at the interview.

6

the EEOC's theory, if an interviewer suspected that the

7

not make any assumptions about future compliance, if the

duty to accommodate upon that correct understanding at

The only way that employers

can protect themselves under the EEOC's approach is by

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

training their managers to stereotype about possible

2

religious beliefs because a judge or jury might later

find that Abercrombie or an employer correctly

understood, or must have correctly understood, under an

5

objective test which they don't disclaim in their amici

briefs.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you're essentially

8

saying that the problem with the rule is that it

9

requires Abercrombie to engage in what might be thought

10

of as an awkward conversation, to ask some questions.

11

Now, people can disagree about whether one can ask those

12

that rule is a rule where Abercrombie just gets to say,

getting jobs.

19

because we're just going to cut these people out and

make sure that they never become Abercrombie employees.

But the alternative to

Now, between those two options, the option

of using a stereotype to make sure that somebody never

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERSHENGORN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice:
I'd like to make just two quick factual

6

points to clear up what I see to be some confusion in

7

the record.

8
9

First of all, there was some discussion
about whether, in fact, you needed to comply with the

10

Look Policy.

11

which the district court says ­­ 94(a) of the Petition

12

Appendix ­­ the policy applies to all store employees,

13

but applicants are not required to be in compliance at

14

the time of the interview.

I point the Court to 94(a), which the ­­

18

is undisputed ­­ I'm sorry, that Elauf did or did not

19

know ­­ it is undisputed ­­ this is at 97(a) of the

20

court's opinion ­­ it is undisputed that Cooke did not

21

tell her that Abercrombie would not permit models to

22

wear headscarves or to wear black clothing.

It is crystal

The district court said it

23

The Look Policy script, should the Court

24

wish to look at it, is Plaintiff's Exhibit 4 in the

25

trial.

It quotes what the Look Policy is.

about what I called his administrative argument?
MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I would.

8

I think the administrative argument actually cuts in our

sense ­­ in our favor in a couple of ways.

First of

all, the suggestion that there are practical problems

unlike employees, who are in a position to go back and
