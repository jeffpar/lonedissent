ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HUGHES:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Trademark tacking is a legal fiction that

12

permits an owner to modernize a mark without losing

13

priority.

14

that the later mark does not unreasonably expand the

15

legal effect of the earlier mark.

16

The proponent of tacking must demonstrate

To decide whether a change is a permissible

17

modernization or an impermissible expansion, a court

18

will consider the extent to which the new mark, if

19

tacked, could unfairly squeeze out intervening users and

20

it will examine the circumstances in which past cases

21

have permitted tacking.

22

In assessing the legal effects of the marks,

23

the Court will consider their aural and visual

24

appearance and consumer impression.

25

ultimately turns on the Court's judgment as to whether

support the conclusion that tacking should be viewed an

The mark Hana Bank has a

12

important issue, what's happening here is a legal

marks were used and the commercial impression?

MR. HUGHES:

Your Honor, I don't think

10

that's the ultimate inquiry.

11

that will be considered, but that ultimately what

12

the Court must evaluate is whether or not they have the

13

same legal effect.

14

highlight this distinction.

15

That's one of the factors

And I think an example might

question were, do these two marks seem to have the same

in between these two marks.

I think that's the right answer and the right
And the reasoning behind that is what happened
In between these two marks

10

a competitor arrived on the scene using the mark

11

American Paging, and the determination was made that

12

American Paging and American Mobile Phone are different

13

marks.

14

Paging folks had the right to use that mark.

15

So the ­­ the second in time, the American

But if tacking were allowed in this case,

16

the effect would be years ­­ a few years after the fact

17

to squeeze out the American Paging Company, even though

18

they couldn't have known at the time that the American

19

Mobile Phone was later going to try to register and then

20

use the mark American Mobile Phone Paging.

21

this all goes to shows that if this is put to the jury,

it's going to be a very different kind of result and

MR. HUGHES:

Well, Your Honor, my submission

3

is that a jury looking at these two marks, if

instructed, just do they have the same consumer

impression?

6

that they do.

not they have the same legal effect in the marketplace.

24

that an opponent's attacking could try to introduce

25

evidence to that effect.

But the ­­ the inquiry would

not be looking to the legal effect between the two

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me that

4

it's rather critical to the contrast you draw.

5

what you're saying is the jury might get it right or the

6

jury might get it wrong, and I would say, well, the

7

Federal Circuit maybe got it right or the Federal

8

Circuit got it wrong.

9

issues are going to be, and those would include what's

I mean,

But in terms of what the factual

10

happening between the two marks, it seems to me the jury

11

has got information just the way the Federal Circuit.

12

don't see the difference between the two other than you

13

think ­­ you think the one result is right and the other

14

would be wrong.

15

MR. HUGHES:

I

Well, Your Honor, I ­­ I think

16

the nature of the inquiry, if it's put to a court, is

17

different than just saying do these marks look like.

18

The nature of the inquiry is what is the legal effect of

19

the earlier mark in the marketplace.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's ­­

Well, why doesn't the ­­ it

21

seems to me the question for the jury is ­­ is not

22

whether they look alike, but whether they create the

23

same commercial impression.

24

instructions to the jury would say these are the two

25

marks, now what you ought to know is that after the

And it seems to me the

2

called American Paging, and then the mark was changed

3

from American Mobile Phone to American Mobile Phone

4

Paging.

different commercial impression than the first one?

6

I think a jury would say, heck, yes.

7

Do you think that that second mark creates a

MR. HUGHES:

And

Well, Your Honor, I think what

8

a jury is not doing in that circumstance is it's not

9

taking the prospective evaluation of the earlier mark

10

against the later mark in figuring out just how much of

11

a difference, of a change there was.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but suppose that an

13

important part of the case was that when American Paging

14

came along for a few years everybody in the United

15

States knew that.

16

about it.

18

consumer's expertise, in knowing how consumers behave,

19

how consumers think is ­­ is immensely valuable.

The first mark, not many people knew

That it seems to me would be critical to the

20

MR. HUGHES:

Well, there are a few things

21

about that, Your Honor.

I think, first off, that the

22

tacking inquiry is not going to look just at these sole

23

particular marks that happen to exist, but a court is

24

going to take a broader perspective and to think about

25

what are the whole range of marks that would be

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

preempted by the earlier and the later to figure out if

2

what's happening ­­ if this kind of tacking is

3

reasonable in the circumstance.

4

But ­­ but I think there is an additional

5

reason to think that this should be better viewed as a

6

question of law, because, similar to as the Court held

7

in Markman, this would have stare decisis effect such

8

that when a court makes a determination as to tacking

9

that would have application in future cases involving

10

those same kinds of marks.

11

of law, one could get different results using the same

12

marks across different cases.

13

kind of ­­

14

If it's viewed as a question

And I think this is the

15

as a question of fact?

And if it's viewed

17

If it's viewed as a question of fact, one could have

different results.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are there any facts that

20

you think a jury could determine here or should

21

determine in this kind of a case, in a tacking case?

MR. HUGHES:

Well, that is right, Your

Honor.

19

factor, which is the aural and visual appearance, do the

20

two marks have the same aural and visual appearance.

21

And what I think that shows is if the courts are not

22

looking at this as a factual comparison ­­

23

But also the Federal Circuit adds an additional

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, aural or visual

24

appearance, shouldn't that also ­­ aural and visual to

25

whom?

To the people likely to buy these products, not

to the judge.
MR. HUGHES:

Well, Your Honor, I think what

3

both of these factors are showing is that these are ­­

4

are proxy ways the courts are looking to determine if we

5

can view these same ­­ these two marks as legally

6

equivalent such that we can use this legal fiction of

7

tacking that provides a very valuable benefit to the

8

proponent of tacking that they can effectively go back

9

in time and ­­ and alter their marks after the point.

10

And so this is a constructive use theory, as the Ninth

11

Circuit, in particular, identified.

12

In that kind of determination, whether or

13

not that legal benefit would flow I think is the kind of

14

thing that is appropriately put to a court because it's

15

going to ­­ to turn on a judgment, not just of these

16

marks, but what the relevant policy considerations are

17

in the case, balancing the interests between the rights

18

of the individual trademark owner to modernize or polish

19

up their mark as against everyone else in the

20

marketplace who has an interest and not having marks

21

expanded unduly years after the fact in a way that ­­

22

that was entirely unpredictable.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As I understand your

24

brief, you say, no, the test really isn't same

25

continuing commercial impression to consumers.

Alderson Reporting Company

You are

Official

15
1

saying it's the scope of ­­ the scope of the old and the

2

new, and you can't use tacking to expand what the old

3

would have meant.

4

MR. HUGHES:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
But if the answer to that

6

is that of course you can't; if you are saying that the

7

old one was the first use, then whatever the scope of

8

the old one is, is it, and you can't add to it because

9

of what you did later.

10

MR. HUGHES:

I think that's ­­

11

that's ­­ that's right, Your Honor.

12

our point is that whenever a mark is changed, there

13

might be some minor alteration, and a court must make

14

the determination as to the amount that the preemptive

15

scope had changed.

16

Or is it the ­­ the kind of small modernization that the

17

tacking doctrine is designed to permit such that the

18

mark owner can make these ­­ these small alterations.

19

Is it material?

I think what out ­­

Is it substantial?

And that's what is ultimately the legal

20

judgment.

21

has been made in the later mark, understand that both

22

how much of a change there is, how close the change in

23

those factors are to the ­­ to the earlier mark, and ­­

24

and then consider how that applies in that particular

circumstance.

A court must look to see how much of a change

It's what is the scope of the old mark and what is

MR. HUGHES:

Yes, Your Honor.

And if the answer is that

the new mark can't go beyond the scope of the old,

MR. HUGHES:

Well, and I think ­­ I think

15

position.

16

only a court can judge what the ­­ what the legal scope

17

of those two marks are because that requires a

18

prospective assessment as to the range of marks.

19

That is ­­ that is our

I think that's a determination, though, that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what I ­­ what I was

20

trying to suggest is you would never get to what the

21

second mark scope is because what the scope of the first

22

one is determinative.

23

MR. HUGHES:

Well, and I think as we put it,

24

Your Honor, that the scopes have to be virtually

25

identical.

We recognize that there could be some

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

17
1

difference in change because whenever a mark is changed

2

there will be some daylight between the two.

3

recognize that that is inherent in tacking, that there

4

will always be some change, some degree of squeeze­out.

5

The judgment determination is how much of a change, how

6

much of a squeeze­out is ­­ is ­­ is permissible in one

7

case such that the two marks can be viewed as legally

8

the same mark to allow the tacking doctrine to operate.

We

9

As another example just to point to that I

10

think might come at this the opposite way, this ­­ in

11

the red brief at page 50, there is the ­­ the example

12

that the Respondents provide of D&J Master Clean, and

13

this is an example where tacking was, in ­­ in ­­ in

14

fact, allowed.

15

the mark "Servicemaster."

16

came on the scene using the mark "Master Clean."

17

third­in­time then, the ­­ the Servicemaster altered

18

their mark to "Servicemaster Clean" and used that mark

19

to exclude the intervening competitor, the "Master

20

Clean" competitor.

21

again viewing this as a question of law.

22

In that context, the original mark was
The second­in­time competitor
The

And the Court permitted tacking,

The reason it allowed tacking in that

23

particular case was it sought to understand how close

24

the later mark or the ­­ the "Master Clean" mark, this

25

intervening mark, was to the rights that the trademark

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

18
1

owner had in its original mark of "Servicemaster," and

2

it made a judgment finding that it was reasonably

3

foreseeable that "Servicemaster" would ­­ would adopt

4

the mark "Servicemaster Clean," and thus there was

5

nothing unfair in the marketplace to excluding "Master

6

Clean," that the implications of tacking in that case

7

were, in fact, appropriate.

8
9

And I think this ­­ this further shows the
kind of legal determination and ­­ and reasoning that ­­

10

that turns on the interests of all the market

11

participants that is uniquely situated to ­­ to the role

12

that a court can play.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Again, if I could

14

just ­­ what is it that you think a jury could not be

15

instructed on in addressing that same consideration?

16

MR. HUGHES:

What I think a jury would not

17

be able to do the way that a court can, is a jury cannot

18

understand what the legal significance of Service Master

19

compared to the legal significance of Master Clean.

20

what I mean by legal significance is what is the whole

21

range of marks out there that each of those marks

22

exclude.

23

just how much of a change has ­­ has occurred in the

24

marketplace and then, of that change, how close is that

25

thing I'd point the Court to is that in 1989, the

discussing set forth just how narrow this tacking

2

doctrine is.

3

hewed very closely to the narrowness of this doctrine.

4

I think the presentation here is ­­ is a bit ­­ gives a

5

different impression because it takes cases that were

6

prior to the American Mobile Phone error when tacking

7

was used in a ­­ a far more broad array of

8

circumstances.

9

And the cases that have followed have

I think when you look to the post­1989

10

cases, you find incredible consistency that tacking is

11

denied in all but the most extraordinary case where the

12

marks truly are effectively identical and have the same

13

legal continuing impressions.

14

you look to some early cases, you see different results.

15

But looking to ­­ to the modern era of cases, there's

16

far more consistency.

17

So ­­ so I do think if

And further, to the extent that any sort of

18

predictability can be established by treating these

19

marks as having legal authoritative effect in creating

20

that kind of predictability to the marketplace, I think,

21

is better than the alternative of leaving it to simply a

22

case­by­case, jury­by­jury determination.

23

The next point I'd like to make is this has

24

always historically been treated as a question of ­­ of

25

law for a court.

We've ­­ we've taken ­­ we've looked

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

analysis that was used historically is still used today

What would the jury do with that knowledge?

MR. VAN DEN BOSCH:

One critical

3

consideration in the American Mobile Phone paging case

4

is that in that case, the two marks that were sought to

5

be tacked were, in fact, used on ­­ on very different

6

products.

7

that should be considered by a jury in determining

8

whether there is truly a continuum.

9

And that's the type of extrinsic evidence

I'll take that a step further.

In the Van

10

Dyne Crotty case in the Federal Circuit, which is the

11

first circuit to deem it a question of law, a critical

12

consideration there was that the third­in­time mark had

13

effectively purchased a first­in­time mark in order to

14

try and leapfrog a second­in­time mark.

that case, the two marks that were sought to be tacked

were used by two different parties on two different sets

of those questions is that the marks have to have the

product, and the question in terms of are they going to

be confused by it, they're not, because they're going to

know it's the same manufacturer.

Right.

important to keep separate the tacking question and the

That almost suggests to

10

me that a lot of these older cases were decided wrong.

Unless the jury knows about how limited this ­­

12

MS. HARRINGTON:

And certainly the jury will

13

know that because they will be instructed about when

14

tacking is appropriate.

15

Petitioner's request, the jury was instructed that the

16

marks should be allowed to be tacked only if they create

the same continuing commercial impression.

21

22

stringent type of instruction.

this case.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And certainly if a party

That didn't happen in

What part does the judges

in setting the boundaries by deciding the question

either on summary judgment or judgment as a matter of

2

law, that ­­ I ­­ my thought was that a judge would not

let ­­ that the bounds of the doctrine were decided by

4

the judge when he puts the question to the jury.

5

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's right.

I mean, a

6

judge in these cases plays the same important roles that

7

a judge plays in every civil jury trial, which is to say

8

that the judge decides the legal rules and instructs the

9

jury on that, and then the judge also will decide merits

10

determinations if the evidence that's presented could

11

only lead to one reasonable conclusion about those

12

determinations.

13

And so when a judge decides a tacking issue

14

on summary judgment or motion to dismiss, the judge is

15

setting the outer bounds of the tacking doctrine and just

16

the same way it does in any other issue that comes up in

a civil trial that would be tried to a jury.

don't discount that.

And we

3

judge could decide the question.

5

the jury also decide the question.

about this question that a judge is really well­equipped

than a judge might be.

And what's a jury?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

A jury is a

I assume the same would be

true of likelihood of confusion if that's the argument,

17

right, that the jury serves as a focus group in the same

18

way for that question.

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

And I think

20

Petitioner may have misspoken when he suggested that ­­

21

Petitioner's counsel when he suggested that there's a

22

circuit split on whether likelihood of confusion is a

23

question for a jury or a question for a judge.

24

aware of any circuit that has held it's a question for a

25

judge only.

I'm not

There's a circuit split on whether it's a

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

41
1

question of law or a question of fact and that affects

2

how you review it on appeal.

3

every circuit treats it as a question for the jury.

But as far as I know,

4

And one important element of the likelihood

5

of confusion analysis in every circuit is a comparison

6

of the similarity of two marks.

7

that a jury can make that comparison.

8

different ­­ again, you're comparing different marks

Petitioner has conceded
That's a

10

degree of similarity you're looking for, but it's not

11

different in kind, that kind of analysis.

12

no reason that I can think of why a jury would be

13

well­equipped to answer that question, but not equipped

14

to answer the consumer impression comparison question in

15

the tacking context.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And there's

I'll check it out in my

18

likelihood of confusion issue on the point of whether it

19

goes to the judge or the jury.

20

I thought that there was a split on the

MS. HARRINGTON:

Not as far as I can tell.

21

There's a split on whether it's a question of law or a

22

question of fact and, in fact, that's also the circuit

23

split as to tacking.

24
25

But, you know, in the Second Circuit, for
example, they have held that likelihood of confusion is

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

42
1

a question of law, but their review jury determinations

2

on likelihood of confusion; they just review them

3

without giving them much deference to the jury's

4

ultimate determination.

5

juries in most circuits that have held that it's a

6

question of law, which I admit doesn't make a lot of

7

sense and we think isn't necessarily the right way to do

8

it.

Those issues are decided by

10

about Petitioner's reliance on history ­­

11
12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:
answer, I am.

If I look confused by your

I'll check it.

MS. HARRINGTON:

Okay.

So the circuit split

14

is on law versus fact, not judge versus jury for

15

likelihood of confusion.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Seeing as

17

those courts that think it's an issue of law, they still

18

give it to a jury but then ignore what the jury says?

19

MS. HARRINGTON:

20

more complicated than that.

21

that's not the issue here, I don't want to waste

22

the Court's time, but it's some odd version of that.

23

Some version of that.

It's

I don't want to ­­ because

If I could just say a word about

24

Petitioner's reliance on history, Petitioner identifies

25

a number of cases in which judges, you know, going way

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43
1

back, in which judges have decided tacking questions.

2

But none of those cases are cases where a jury was

3

impaneled to decide the infringement issue.

4

all cases that were decided on summary judgment or

5

motion to dismiss, that were tried as bench trials, or

6

that were suits for injunctive relief.

7

treatment of tacking in those cases tells us nothing

8

about what we should do when a jury is actually

9

impaneled.

10

Those are

And so the

And as far as I know, Petitioner has not

11

identified and I'm not aware of a single case from any

12

period of time in which a jury was impaneled to decide

13

an infringement issue and the judge took the issue away

14

from the jury.

15

that's because generally when you have civil trials and

16

you have a jury impaneled, these questions of ultimate

17

determinations of factual issues and even when they go

18

to the ultimate legal determinations they're decided by

19

juries who are properly instructed.

20

There just isn't such an example.

And

Now, I say that there's a lot of ­­ a lot of

21

overtone in Petitioner's argument that we're worried

22

about juries getting it wrong and there is an argument

23

that the jury got it wrong in this case.

24

that shouldn't drive your decision about whether juries

25

or judges should decide this issue, because juries, just

Alderson Reporting Company

But I think

Official

like judges, can get things wrong all the time and we

2

have mechanisms in place to correct erroneous jury

verdicts.

4

You can argue that the jury was improperly

made in this case.

7

sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict.

8

was the argument that Petitioner made on appeal to the

9

Ninth Circuit.

That wasn't an argument that's ever been
Or you can argue that there wasn't
That

The argument was rejected and Petitioner

10

has not asked this Court to review that determination.

11

So, however you feel about whether the jury

12

got it right or wrong in this case, that shouldn't tell

13

­­ that doesn't tell you whether the jury should or

14

shouldn't have had the right to answer the question.

15

think it's clearly a fact­based question and it should

16

go to the jury.

17

Just one last point if I could.

We

The

18

Petitioner has basically asserted that you should only

19

really look at the two marks themselves and that will

20

almost always tell you what you need to do, and when you

21

look at precedent you just look at those two marks.

22

as the Justices have suggested, it's ­­ you know, just

23

looking at how other marks in the past have been treated

24

doesn't always tell you the full story.

25

And even in the American Mobile Phone case,

Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

45
1

one of the dispositive considerations in that case was

2

not just looking at the marks and how they looked and

3

what the words were, and it wasn't just the fact that

4

there was an intervening mark that was similar, they

5

looked ­­ the Court looked at, or the TTAB and then the

6

Federal Circuit approved it, looked at how the two

7

different marks had been used in the Yellow Pages and

8

whether they had been used to advertise the same kind of

9

products or different kind of products.

And that just

10

shows that tacking is a very context specific inquiry.

11

You need to look at how the ­­ how the marks are used in

12

advertising with respect to the products and, you know,

13

how the consumers actually perceive those marks.

14

And, of course, if a company is in a

15

position where it's contemplating amending its mark and

16

it wants to have some sort of certainty about whether

17

that will be allowed, it can go to its consumers and do

18

consumer surveys and say, you know, do you think if we

19

changed it this way would you still have the same

20

consumer impression?

21

evidence that it would have introduced at trial if

22

tacking came up at trial.

23

It can, in other words, gather the

Also, and this ­­ I guess this can be the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL W. HUGHES

4

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. HUGHES:

6

Three brief points.

Thank you, Your Honor.
Our fundamental

7

submission is that there is more going on here than

8

simply the consumer impression test.

9

there's a reason that this is called the legal

test.

I think

10

equivalents test and not simply just consumer impression

11

and that's because what is happening here is a deeper

12

legal judgment that corresponds to the legal fiction

13

that ­­ that is tacking.

14

And I think what's deeper about this is just

15

informing a jury that the question is, do these two

16

marks have the same consumer impression is going to not

17

just lead to a different result, but a very different

18

kind of test than if a court looks at these past

19

examples to truly understand how narrow tacking is.

20

I think if one just reads what the ­­ what

21

the standard of continuing consumer impression and

then you look to the past cases, there is some confusion

as to how these cases have come out.

quoting here ­­ "if a new mark creates a different right

4

5

In Page 19 of our blue brief, for

That was our controlling framework from the

continued through into the yellow brief.

The second point I would like to make is

18

that this is, in fact, truly a judicially created

19

doctrine and where this is a judicially created doctrine

that is getting at a legal fiction, I think this is

21

precisely the kind of circumstance where this legal test

22

that we discussed must have a legal aspect or legal

23

component that is put to the judge.

24

So back to the question what happens in that

25

second stage in terms of what is the legal aspect of the

test, the court will assess how much of a change has

certainly objected that that was an impermissible use.
