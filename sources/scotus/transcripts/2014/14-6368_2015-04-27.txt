ORAL ARGUMENT OF WENDY M. WARD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The core of the liberty interest protected

12

by due process is the right to be free from unjustified

13

bodily restraint and harm.

14

anything more inconsistent with these core rights than

15

the use of a weapon on a restrained detainee, and that

16

is why Respondents urge this Court to import a

17

subjective intent element that doesn't relate to due

18

process, but is instead drawn from the test for

19

violation of a convicted prisoner's Eighth Amendment

20

rights.

21

It's hard to imagine

Respondents candidly admit that they favor

22

this test because it better insulates guards from

23

liability, but that is no reason to ignore meaningful

24

constitutional distinctions between those who have been

25

convicted and those who have not.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why isn't the

2

safety of the detainee, why isn't that just a facet of

3

the use of excessive force?

4

district court treated it.

5

MS. WARD:

I think that's how the

The ­­ the safety of the detainee

6

was the stated objective for the use of the force in ­­

7

in this case.

8

the determination of whether the ­­ the force itself was

9

excessive is based on the Bell test for legitimate

And that is a legitimate interest, but

10

purpose, legitimate penological objectives.

11

test is objectively, then, whether or not the use of

12

force was excessive to the state ­­ stated need and the

13

Fourth Amendment test provides a ­­ a ­­ a good familiar

14

workable standard that can be used to determine that

15

question.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So then the

You ­­ you mentioned the

17

Fourth Amendment now, but as I understand it, the

18

complaint just alleged a due process violation.

19

didn't ­­ it didn't refer to the Fourth Amendment.

20

MS. WARD:

It

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

21

­­ and the Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process

22

test as articulated in Bell does provide the clearest

23

application by the Court of the rights of detainees in

24

the prison context.

25

And the Court has stated that Bell does

Alderson Reporting Company

apply to the excessive force claims of pretrial

2

detainees and it makes perfect sense because, like a

3

prison policy that goes too far, it's easy to see how

4

a use of force can be administered as punishment.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So suppose you have a

detainee being held in a prison population.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.
Is it possible ­­ I

18

hadn't thought about it too much ­­ that you would have

different priorities in training, depending on whether

20

you're dealing with people who've already been convicted

21

of crimes and people who are being detained, like,

perhaps people who have been convicted tend to engage in

23

particular activity more than people just awaiting

with malice, but it would seem to me if the standards

12

are broader with respect to people who have been

convicted, you might tell the officers, look, you have

14

more flexibility with respect to people who are already

15

subject to a conviction.

you're going to go to jail if you've got 10 days on a

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING AFFIRMANCE
MR. BASH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
If there's one point I would like to convey

8

to the Court this morning which I think is responsive to

9

a number of questions that were asked in the opening

10

presentation, it's that there are two relevant

11

differences between the standard we're advancing and the

12

standard Mr. Clement is about to get up and talk about.

13

One goes to what sort of purpose is

14

required, and the other goes to how you establish that

15

purpose.

16

On the first, Mr. Clement says it is

17

malicious and sadistic intent.

18

purpose.

19

Amendment cases, Farmer, Wilson, Whitley, that malicious

20

and sadistic comes from the wantonness requirement of

21

Eight Amendment, cruel and unusual.

22

We say it is a punitive

It is clear as day in the Court's Eighth

He is just wrong about that.

The only

23

argument he has on that ­­ that it should be malicious

24

and sadistic is Judge Friendly's opinion that this Court

25

cited in a couple Eighth Amendment cases.

Alderson Reporting Company

But if you

Official

23
1

look at Judge Friendly's analysis ­­ this is on page 28

2

of the red brief ­­ he very clearly says that there's a

3

whole list of factors relevant.

4

is one factor.

5

other factors are objective.

6

Malicious and sadistic

It's not dispositive, and all of the

So I don't think you can extrapolate from a

few citations to Judge Friendly that malicious and

sadistic is appropriate for a due process claim for

someone who has not convicted of an offense.

And by the way, I think ­­

punishment to require a degree of subjective intent.

of course, that clause does not say the word

"punishment."

process rights as detainees?

22

MR. BASH:

Because the Due Process Clause

23

permits the punishment of people who are convicted.

24

as this Court interpreted that in the context of

25

convicted prisoners, it's that convicted prisoners may

intent to punish, and the punishment was carried out by

the use of force.

14

is these cases on the margin, where the officer maybe

had mixed motives or whatever.

Eighth Amendment jurisprudence is that we're going to

who is subject to the penological force of the State.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

This Court should adopt ­­ adopt the

15

subjective test fashioned by Judge Friendly in Johnson

16

against Glick in addressing a due process claim for

17

excessive force by a pretrial detainee.

18

This Court has already adopted that standard

19

in the Eighth Amendment context for convicted prisoners,

20

and both doctrinal and practical reasons strongly

21

suggest that it should apply the same test in the due

22

process context in which that test originated, and the

23

contrary propositions are simply not compatible with

24

this Court's precedents.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Johnson and Glick, the

Alderson Reporting Company

so?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

The

4

bottom line was a remand so that there could be a ­­ a

5

factual determination based on the Four Factor Test that

6

Judge Friendly articulated.

7

So in the lower courts, they dismissed the

8

claim.

9

Clause does provide protection, and then he articulated

10

that Four Factor Test, one important part of which is a

11

subjective factor that, I think, sensibly tries to

12

distinguish those situations where an officer is trying

13

to use force in a good faith effort to maintain order

14

and discipline and contrast that with a situation where

15

the force is being used sadistically or maliciously for

16

the very purpose of inflicting pain.

17

Judge Friendly recognized that the Due Process

going to be given anyway.

There are

What's that?
Under ­­ under the Bell

v. Wolfish case, that presumption was given anyhow.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, but I ­­ I don't ­­ I

15

mean, I think there are real differences between the

16

instruction, and if you look at – the way ­­ the clearest

17

way to illustrate this is if you look at Joint Appendix

18

page 78 and you look at the instruction that was offered

19

by the Petitioners below, it flat out says you can't take

20

into account the good faith intent of the officer.

21

irrelevant.

22

It's

Now, I think that's perfectly appropriate in

23

a Fourth Amendment instruction where there's objective

24

reasonableness, and this Court said a bunch of times

25

that the subjective intent of the officer doesn't

matter.
But in the difficult context of a prison, I

3

think Judge Friendly got it right, I think this Court

4

got it right with respect to convicted prisoners, which

5

is you give the guard a little bit of flexibility

6

because it's a difficult situation.

7

after the fact, maybe they shouldn't have used the

8

Taser, or if, in a case where they used the Taser twice,

9

maybe they should've used it once, but not twice, those

And if you say

10

questions of degree ought to be some degree of

11

deference.

12

This test allows for that.

It gives a jury

13

a landing place.

14

say, you know, I wish they hadn't used the Taser, but I

15

think they were doing it to get the handcuffs off.

16

isn't a case like Hudson against McMillan where they

17

were just taking the guy out and beating him up

18

punitively.

19

Constitutional violation here.

20

If they look at this in hindsight and

This

So I don't think there should be a

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's true ­­ you

21

know, what you say is equally true where you're running

22

a jail, isn't it?

23

person in the jail is ­­ has been convicted or hasn't

24

been convicted.

25

And it's equally true where the

The need for order is the same.

So how would it apply in a circumstance

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

38
1

where there's a claim of excessive force to someone who

2

has been convicted, but it has nothing to do with

3

punishment.

4

The situation was one where they were trying to maintain

5

order, or the situation was one where they were trying

6

to give medical treatment, or the situation was any one

7

of a thousand.

8
9

No one thinks it has to do with punishment.

What I can't see is why the punishment
standard should apply whether he's been convicted or

10

not.

11

whether he's been convicted or not.

12

And I also can't see why they should be different

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I think the punishment

13

standard applies in both cases, Justice Breyer, because

14

the relevant constitutional text has been interpreted to

15

require punishment.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the Eighth Amendment context ­­
But suppose you brought a

17

lawsuit under the Due Process Clause?

18

there are instances where people are seized in jail, so

19

it was under the Fourth Amendment.

20

I mean ­­ and

I mean, why is punishment in these other

21

situations?

22

figure out ­­ and then I looked at the Model Penal Code.

23

The Model Penal Code seems to require both excessive

24

force and some kind of state of mind, which could be

25

recklessness, which is what the judge said here or maybe

I can't figure that one out.

Alderson Reporting Company

I can't

Official

39
1
2

even negligence.
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, obviously, if you adopt,

3

as this Court has in the Eighth Amendment context, the

4

understanding that punishment inherently requires some

5

subjective mental state, the lowest available mental

6

state is recklessness and under that standard, which the

7

jury clearly was instructed under, we would prevail.

8

that would lead to an affirmance.

9

So

Now, I would still think, since it is

10

well­established that the relevant standard for

11

excessive force in cases involving convicted prisoners

12

is the Johnson v. Glick standard, I think since that's

13

established and nobody here is asking for Whitley or

14

Hudson to be overruled, and there are so many practical

15

imperatives for treating pretrial detainees and

16

convicted prisoners the same, I think this Court should

17

apply the Johnson v. Glick standard in the due process

18

claims of pretrial detainees.

19

In a subsequent case, if the Court wants to

20

reconsider what the test should be even under the Eighth

21

Amendment and apply it uniformly across pretrial

22

detainees and convicted inmates, that may make some

23

sense.

24
25

I also think there's some very interesting
questions lurking out there about what kind of objective

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

40
1

evidence of unreasonableness is enough in an Eighth

2

Amendment case, or if we prevail, a Fifth Amendment

3

case, what kind of objective evidence is enough to get

4

to the jury on the subjective intent question.

5

those are all questions that this Court may eventually

6

have to confront, but I think the first step in a case

7

where nobody wants to overrule Hudson and Whitley is to

8

suggest that since the imperatives that the officers

9

face with respect to pretrial detainees and convicted

10

inmates are essentially identical.

11
12

I think

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why is that?

Why don't you

tell us why that's so?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'll ­­ I'll tell you

14

why that's so.

15

a ­­ in a local jail like Monroe County, Wisconsin,

16

where you have these individuals, they're housed side by

side.

18

of jail, the only way you can serve their sentence as a

convicted individual is if you've been convicted for a

20

relatively minor offense.

21

awaiting your trial, any ­­ any ­­ any book ­­ any ­­

22

any offense in the criminal book could be your charge of

23

­­ that ­­ where you're being held for, so it could be a

murderer.

3

and ­­ and more recently, in the Florence County case.

When you ­­

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, sorry.

There's

a lot to what you say that sometimes the practical

7

concerns are the same for pretrial detainees and for

8

convicted criminals.

9

other point of view, which is that in our cases, we've

There's also something to the

10

consistently said that if you're a pretrial detainee, if

you haven't been found to have committed wrongful

conduct, you shouldn't be treated the same way as people

13

who have been found to have committed wrongful conduct;

14

that for the convicted criminals, it's kind of, you

19

for that, you know, very commonsensical, and also, you

know, normatively attractive proposition that people who

haven't been found to have done anything ought not to be

22

treated with the same level of disregard for their

23

interests as people who have been?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kagan, there is a

5

from minimum security to maximum security as a punitive

6

matter, and you didn't even have to give them any

7

process to do that.

8

would apply to pretrial detainees.

9

So let me tell you where

I mean, Sandin against Conner is a good

There the Court said that with convicted

I don't think that same analysis

Another example is footnote 17 of the Bell

10

against Wolfish case, where I think it's understood that

11

at least if the statutory law provides for it, that if

12

you're convicted, you can be sent out to the work gang

13

and have to pick up trash along the highway.

14

think you can do that to a pretrial detainee.

15

whatever differences there are, I don't think they arise

16

in an excessive force context.

17

about this Court's cases, and start with Whitley.

18

you're trying to quell a prison riot, and you have an

19

inmate who's going up the stairs, trying to go where

20

there's an unarmed guard, it doesn't make a whit of

difference whether that inmate is a pretrial detainee or

22

a ­­ a ­­ a convicted individual.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't
But

I think if you think
If

So that might be, but let's

24

take another comparison.

25

people who have been indicted for the same offense, and

And the comparison is two

doesn't make bail, and so he is in an institutional

facility.

4

5

into his pocket to take out something, and the police

officer shoots him.

7

circumstances are such that this is utterly

unreasonable.

12

he's not going to be treated in any respect the same

way.

14

Why should that be so?
MR. CLEMENT:

I think because the fact of

incarceration really is a game­changer.

he has exactly ­­ or she, the exact same expectations as

23

that's the Fourth Amendment standard.

24

When you're in the incarceration context,
things are different.

6

the main, in the incarceration context.

7

it makes sense to apply a standard that's slightly more

8

forgiving of the prison guards than of the police

officers.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The need to protect the

And so I think

And I ­­ I still find it

11

very hard to understand how use of force can be excessive

12

without being at least reckless.

13

For excessive use of force, but yet what ­­ what does the

14

reckless add to it?

15

force, isn't that at least reckless by definition?

16

It's ­­ it's confusing.

If ­­ if it's an excessive use of

MR. CLEMENT:

I think often it will be.

17

We're not here to defend the recklessness instruction as

18

the platonic sort of form.

19

applying Judge Friendly's instruction from Johnson

20

against Glick is the right way to go, which we think

21

provides a little more separation between the two.

We actually think that

22

I don't think, though ­­ I mean, we can ­­

23

we can obviously come up with hypothetical situations

24

where there are going to be different applications.

25

think the principal difference here is this instruction,

Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official

45
1

both in the Eighth Amendment context, and in the due

2

process context in Johnson v. Glick, I think it gives

3

the jury a practical landing place when they think, you

4

know, with the benefit of hindsight, I wish the police

5

­­ I wish the corrections officer hadn't done that, but

6

I don't think it was completely outside of the bounds of

7

what was reasonable.

8

purposeless and so arbitrary that it gives rise to an

9

inference that it had a punitive motive.

10

I certainly don't think it's so

That gives the jury kind of a reasonable

11

landing place, and I think this case is actually a

12

pretty good illustration of this.

13

at this and you ask yourself, was it reasonable to use

14

the Taser?

15

punitive?

16

get the handcuffs off?

17

I think if you look

That's a debatable question.

Was it really

Was it unrelated to an interest in trying to
Of course not.

And so I do think in cases like this, it

gives the jury an appropriate landing place to come up

19

and make a judgment that doesn't second guess the

20

officers.

21

deference to prison officials is an important value.

22

And I think this test that we've proposed that, again,

23

originates with Judge Friendly in a due process case

And this Court has said so many times that

the deck completely.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, in ­­ in fairness, and

17

to correct the Assistant Solicitor General, the

18

instruction we asked for, which is at Joint Appendix 65,

19

it has all of the Johnson factors.

20

we think ­­ and that's the pattern jury instruction in

21

an excessive force case for a prisoner in the Seventh

22

Circuit, we think it gets it right, which is it focuses

23

the ultimate inquiry on this, is it a punitive intent or

24

is it a good faith effort to restore order.

25

Now, it focuses, as

But then if you look for the factors that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47
1

the jury can consider, all four ­­ all the rest of the

2

Johnson factors are there.

3

the best reading of Bell v. Wolfish, too, which is to

4

say it provides objective factors, but then it's

5

basically asking, you can look at those objective

6

factors and it allows –

And we think that's actually

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Except that –

8

MR. CLEMENT: ­­ you to infer a punitive intent.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Bell v. ­­ Bell v.

12

punish.

13

objective test and says, in that particular case, that

14

the conditions met that ­­ those conditions as well, but

15

it treated it as alternative.

16

It assumes there's not, and then it goes to the

MR. CLEMENT:

That's ­­

Well, I think alternative ways

17

to prove a punitive intent.

18

Wolfish, when it talks about those objective factors, it

19

then says, so if you have purposeless or arbitrary

20

government action, the court may infer an intent to

21

punish.

22

ultimately a subjective inquiry.

And if you look at Bell v.

So it's objective factors in service of what is

23

The other thing I think that needs to be

24

added, though, is that Bell v. Wolfish, you know, we

25

think we win under it.

But it is a test that was really

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

designed to judge some conditions questions.

2

think Johnson against Glick, and we think, in the ­­ in

3

the Eighth Amendment context, Whitley and ­­ and Hudson,

4

are directed at the unique dynamic that you have in

5

excessive force cases.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we

Am I right that the

7

pattern instruction in ­­ in this case, the pattern

8

instruction asked only the excessive force question,

9

asked the jury to decide whether the force was excessive

10
11

in light of the particular facts and circumstances?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, okay.

So there were two

12

pattern instructions, neither of which were used.

13

was the pattern instruction which my friends wanted to

14

have, which was the Fourth Amendment pattern

15

instruction.

16

the Eighth Amendment standard that we wanted to have.

17

And Judge Crabb essentially split the difference and

18

came up with this nonpattern jury instruction that asked

19

the excessive force question, and baked in this notion

20

of recklessness.

21

There

There was the pattern instruction that was

Now, we think obviously that the lowest

22

standard of intent that could be compatible with the Due

23

Process Clause is recklessness, and so we think you

24

should affirm if you think recklessness is the standard.

25

But in fairness, we think the most coherent way to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

approach this issue is to apply a single unitary

2

standard to pretrial detainees and post­convicted

3

inmates when you're talking about these kind of

excessive force claims.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, why not look at

it this way?

basis of your argument ­­ that being in an institutional

8

setting is the game­changer.

9

important.

10

I mean, you said ­­ and it's really the

There's no doubt it's

But there's another potential game­changer

11

as well, and that is this question of have you actually

12

been convicted?

13

a person who is a wrongdoer?

Has the legal system found that you're

14

So if we say that both of these things are

15

important, why shouldn't we adopt a set of principles

16

that say it is ­­ we're ­­ we're looking for objectively

17

reasonable conduct, but in looking for that, of course

18

we take into account the prison circumstances.

19

course we take into account the context in making that

20

evaluation, so that the person on the street does not

21

necessarily come up with the same result as the person

22

in prison because the contexts are different.

reasonable in hindsight, I don't think you're going to

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I think if you just ask them was it

So that's one reason.
I would think that the jury

14

would give a lot of deference to prison officials, in

15

part because they are unfamiliar with the circumstances.

16

And folks will come in and will say, you know, here's ­­

17

I think that there's ­­ that ­­ that that will be the

18

natural tendency.

19

MR. CLEMENT:

I mean, I hope you're right

20

for the sake of my clients, but I think that tendency is

21

going to be embodied much more if you let them take into

22

account good faith.

23

important way of thinking about the question here,

24

because if you look at their proposed jury instruction,

25

at JA 78, it's the one thing the jury is told they can't

And I think that's a really

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

51
1

take into account, is whether there was good faith.

2

that does not seem particularly productive.

And

3

Another point you made was that, you know,

4

there is this difference that these individuals are ­­

5

have not been convicted.

6

important, and I've talked about a couple of instances

7

where I think that that makes an outcome­determinative

8

difference.

9

And I do think that's

But you also have to take into account that

10

the Bell decision itself said the presumption of

11

innocence has nothing, really, to do with this.

12

think that was a reflection of the reality that when

13

the ­­ an institution is trying to deal with pretrial

14

detainees and inmates, it's not dealing with different

15

entities.

16

And I

Another thing I'd like to say about Bell v.

17

Wolfish is I do think it's an analysis that applies most

18

readily to conditions cases.

19

cases we cite in footnote 9 of our red brief involving

20

the lower courts' applications of various tests

21

requiring subjective intent.

23

paid more attention on rereading it because I noticed

24

that Justice Ginsburg had written the opinion.

And there are a number of

There's a D.C. Circuit

actually quite instructive because in 1984, the D.C.

2

Circuit had the benefit of Bell v. Wolfish.

3

had the benefit of Johnson against Glick.

4

confronted an excessive force claim, as opposed to a

5

conditions claim, the D.C. Circuit looked to Johnson

6

against Glick and not to Bell v. Wolfish, which it

7

doesn't even cite, to provide the relevant standard.

8
9

It also
And when it

And I think that just shows that
Judge Friendly got this one right.

He has an analysis

10

that of course looks to objective factors in terms of

11

the amount of force used, the need for the force, the

12

relationship of the two, but also says, was this a good

13

faith effort to maintain or ­­ or restore order, or was

14

this something that was just sadistic and malicious with

15

the intent to cause harm?

16

My friends from the Solicitor General

17

Office, I guess, don't like the words "salist ­­ sadistic

18

and malicious."

kind of rough, but they actually ­­ you know, Judge

this before, but it is a multifactor test where the

MR. CLEMENT:

right reading of it, which is I think the ultimate

question under that test, and that's certainly the way

context, and you see that in this pattern jury

16

instruction that we propose.

17

The ultimate test is, is this a good faith

18

effort to maintain order, or is this an effort to

19

inflict punishment just for the sake of punishment?

20

then the rest of the factors inform that as, of course,

21

they always would.

22

And

And I think one way of thinking about the

23

question before the Court in this case is that this

24

Court has already borrowed the ­­ the Johnson v. Glick

25

factors that were due process factors ­­ they've already

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

54
1

borrowed them and used them in the Eighth Amendment

2

context.

3

And the question in this case is should they

4

take that due process test and apply it in a due process

5

case?

6

and I really don't think it is.

I think this Court got

7

it right in Hudson and Whitley.

You think about those

8

cases.

9

individual going towards an unarmed guard was pretrial

And that doesn't sound like a difficult question,

Whitley, it wouldn't matter whether or not that

10

or post­conviction.

11

mean, Hudson is this case where you have somebody who is

12

singled out for a punitive beating in response to an

13

altercation with the guard.

14

But in Hudson it's the opposite.

Again, it makes no difference.

I

That's not

15

acceptable behavior, whether or not they are an inmate

16

who's been convicted or pretrial detainee.

17

test to both of these very similar individuals seems to

18

be the appropriate response.

19

If there are no further questions.

And I want to step through the jury

instructions because we part ways with Mr. Bash on the

13

jury instructions in particular.

14

of the confusion comes in in the three different uses of

15

recklessness in the jury instructions, as the dissent

16

below noted.

17

recklessness is used.

18

If you look at ­­ part

There's three different ways that

If you look at 277 of the Joint Appendix,

19

the first use of recklessness is that force is applied

20

recklessly.

21

force is less than deliberate if you look at how force

22

applied recklessly is ­­ is used in Farmer, for example,

23

deliberate indifference.

24

you're conflating deliberate indifference with a

25

deliberate act.

Well, here we're asking whether force is ­­

And Question No. 1 of the special verdict

2

questions, excessive force means force applied

3

recklessly that is unreasonable.

4

is what I was talking about, force applied recklessly;

5

that's also not deliberate.

6

So the ­­ again, this

And then the ­­ the plaintiff is required to

7

prove each of the following factors by a preponderance

of the evidence.

9

Factor 3, which is in addition to the reasonableness

Factor 2 is the reasonableness test.

10

test, is reckless disregard of plaintiff's safety, which

11

is, again, a different use from acting recklessly.

12

And ­­ and it's that reckless disregard for plaintiff's

13

safety language that the Court said in Farmer was

14

unquestionably related to a culpable state of mind.

15

And then if there's any question about

16

whether reckless in our jury instructions were related

17

to a bad intent, the third use of recklessness, which is

18

on 278 about halfway down the page, acted with

19

recklessness disregard of plaintiff's rights.

20

instructions defined that specifically not in the ­­ the

21

special verdict itself, but in the ­­ the instruction on

22

punitive damages, which is found on page 281, where the

23

court said to the jury that an action is in reckless

24

disregard of plaintiff's rights if, under the

25

circumstances, it reflects complete indifference to the

that was used in the jury instructions.
