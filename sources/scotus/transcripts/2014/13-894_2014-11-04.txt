CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear argument

5

Homeland Security v. Robert MacLean.

Mr. Gershengorn.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN H. GERSHENGORN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. GERSHENGORN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
In Section 114(r), Congress directed TSA to

12

promulgate regulations prohibiting disclosures that

13

would be detrimental to the security of transportation.

14

The information covered in the TSA regulations ranges

15

from a flight ­­ flight crew's plans for dealing with a

16

hijacking attempt to vulnerabilities in airport security

17

systems to the kind of de ­­ flight ­­ Federal air

18

marshal deployment information at issue in this case.

19

Under the Federal Circuit's construction of

20

the whistleblower statutes, any one of TSA's 60,000

21

employees may override TSA's expert judgment and

22

publicly disclose sensitive security information in that

23

employee's possession based on that employee's

24

reasonable belief about what public safety requires.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

At what point was ­­ was

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MacLean told that this qualified an ­­ as SSI?

2

me if I'm wrong about this, but as I understood it, he

3

was fired, and it wasn't until the case was before the

4

MSPB that a determination was made that this information

5

qualified as ­­ as what you call SSI.

6

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Correct

Your Honor, I think that's

7

not quite correct, and let me see if I can work it

8

through.

9

The information ­­ the information about

10

Federal air marshal deployment has been prohibited by

11

regulation for more than a decade.

12

expressly prior to 9/11.

13

were promulgated by TSA after 9/11.

14
15
16

It was prohibited

It was in regulations that

JUSTICE GINSBERG:

But when was he first

told?
MR. GERSHENGORN:

He was told that air

17

marshal deployment information was SSI in the training,

18

and it's in the regs.

19

administrative judge that he was unaware that this

20

information was SSI, and the administrative judge

21

rejected that contention.

22

Appendix from 100a to 103a.

23

He argued before the

That's at Petitioner's

What the administrative judge found was his

24

testimony that he did not know this was SSI was

25

inconsistent, nuanced, and evasive, and the judge

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

rejected that contention.
What happens in the TSA final order, which I

3

know Your Honor is referring to, is that TSA creates a

4

final order determining something is SSI precisely so

5

that it can be appealed to the court of appeals under 49

6

U.S.C. 46110, which gives a person aggrieved by a ­­ a

7

TSA order 60 days to appeal something to the court of

8

appeals.

9

Mr. MacLean did so, and the ­­ the Ninth

10

Circuit rejected his argument that this was retroactive

11

classification of TS ­­ of SSI.

12

comes to this Court, there really is no dispute that he

13

understood that this was SSI.

14

So I think as the case

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But it ­­ it

15

certainly is ­­ will, in many cases, be a close

16

question.

17

brief the recognition that the employee can ­­ just to

18

quote it ­­ "can tell the media that Federal air

19

marshals will be absent from important flights, but

20

declining to specify which flights."

21

I was very surprised to see in your reply

I think it would be very difficult to figure

22

out what's SSI and what's not if ­­ given that kind of

23

fine line.

24

MR. GERSHENGORN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, Your Honor ­­

And, again,

I think ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If there were no

regulations, just the statutes on the books, at that

1

point, are there any prohibitions on disclosure?

2

there can be no SSI without at least some regulation?

3
4

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Or

That's correct, Your

Honor.

5

But ­­ and so if I could turn to that, what

6

the Federal Circuit held, the Federal Circuit held that

7

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I don't ­­

I ­­ I think we would prevail even under that

Official

1

interpretation because it's prohibited by regulations

2

that the statute mandated to be disclosed.

3

under this Court's decisions in Robertson and in Sims,

4

which addressed the question of specifically exempted

5

from disclosure by statute, and this Court said that in

6

Robertson, a regulation that gave to the administrator

7

authority to ­­ to ex ­­ to dis ­­ exempt from

8

disclosure after a public interest weighing, and in Sims

9

director an instruction to protect sources and methods,

12

exempted by statute.

is supposed to know something that the lawyer ­­

that that statement ­­ the lawyer did say that.

So ­­

statute alone does not carry the day.
MR. GERSHENGORN:

So, Your Honor, I don't

10

think that's the way the Court looked at it in Robertson

11

and the way the Court looked at it in Sims, because in

12

both of those cases, there had been no determination not

13

to disclose until the administrator made the

14

determination, and yet the Court found that those were

15

specifically ­­ that they were specifically ­­

16

nondisclosure was specifically authorized by statute.

18

If I could just finish the answer to Justice
Ginsburg and to the Chief.

At ­­ to the Chief Justice.

19

At page 15a in the Petitioner's Appendix,

20

what the court ­­ the Federal Circuit said was,

21

"Regulations promulgated pursuant to Congress's express

22

instructions would qualify as specific legal

23

prohibitions."

24

Both arguments were ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So it's the FOIA

exception, Your Honor, that ­­ that establishes

the legislative history what the Senate report said was

18

that the Sims statute, the Section 102(d)(3) of the

19

National Security Act of 1947, would qualify and that's

20

a statute that said, "The director of CIA shall be

21

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Then perhaps more

3

specific.

4

fortiori that if the Court relies on statute, that we

meet that statute and, of course, that ­­ that makes

6

perfect sense.

So we think that ­­ that it follows a

18

And yours says, "There shall be regulations prohibiting

19

the disclosure of information obtained or developed in

20

carrying out security" ­­ and now here's the

21

criterion ­­ "if the under secretary decides disclosing

22

24

And there's another

3

4

12

of points on that.

13

interpreted the statute in Robertson to be sufficiently

14

specific.

15

statute said was, "An administrator shall order

16

information withheld from public disclosure when, in the

17

judgment of the administrator, the disclosure would

18

required in the interest of the public."

that, in doing that, does it automatically fall into the

22

400,000 regulations that govern Defense Department

security information, or could he say, for the purpose

18

Now, you say I'm not

Why not?

MR. GERSHENGORN:

You're not right, Your

20

the judgment that Congress made that the SSI system

21

should coexist with the classified information and with

22

executive orders.

23

doesn't matter that the SSI system that Congress set up

24

4

suddenly thought, as a practical matter, that is not a

serious worry because the President can always use the

To follow up on that, if the

It would have one good

that class ­­ that class of information, controlled

6

Executive Order 13556 deals with that and the President

7

could simply make clear that that executive order

applies to this kind of information.

And I think this is a situation ­­

5

I think this is a situation in which the

Court has ­­ would be right to view that legislative

history with some skepticism and here's why.

8

Congress had before it was a bill that said, but from

What

Had

MR. GERSHENGORN:

So I think what you need

23

to conclude from that, Your Honor, is that the term "by

24

25

and we think that it does.

It excludes those that are

1

internal agency regulations and regulations relating to

2

agency organization, practice or procedures.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

4

MR. GERSHENGORN:

How do I know that?
Because that is the

5

presumption that this Court set up in Chrysler.

6

Chrysler did was interpret the phrase "authorized by

7

law," and what the Court said that "authorized by law"

8

meant had a well­established meaning and that

9

well­established meaning was that regulations that met

What

10

the three­part test in Chrysler, that they were

11

substantive regulations of a legislative type, that they

12

were reasonably within the contemplation with Congress,

13

and they were properly promulgated, were regulations

14

that counted as by law.

15

The Court expressly distinguished internal

16

agency interpretive rules and agency rules of

17

organization, order, and practice and said those were

18

different.

20

We think that is the distinction that is in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If ­­ if that is true and

21

if that is so obvious, Congress would not have ­­ have

22

to have said "by law, rule, or regulation" in the other

23

provision.

24

you said would automatically follow.

25

It could just have said "by law" and what

MR. GERSHENGORN:

No, Your Honor.

24
Alderson Reporting Company

The "law,

Official

1

rule, or regulation" is the formulation that sweeps in

2

agency internal rules and regulations and regulations

3

promulgated pursuant to the housekeeping reg.

4

precisely the distinction that the Court drew in

5

Chrysler and it is precisely the distinction that we

6

draw in the statute.

7

That is

When the statute says "by law, rule, or

8

regulation," it includes all lawfully promulgated

9

regulations, including interpretive rules, including

10

agency's rules of procedure and practice.

11

statute says "by law," what the Court ­­ what is meant

12

and what Chrysler said had a well­established meaning

13

that ­­ that would require a clear showing to overcome

14

is that it includes statutes and it includes regulations

15

that meet the Chrysler three­part test.

16

precise distinction that this Court ­­ that this Court

17

drew in Chrysler, and it is embodied in the statute.

Gershengorn, Chrysler was ­­ it just said "law."

23

would seem, that juxtaposition of the two very different

24

terms, would seem to defeat the Chrysler presumption.

25

MR. GERSHENGORN:

"Law"

So, Your Honor, the reason

1

I don't think it does is because it is equally

consistent with precisely the distinction that Chrysler

drew between regulation ­­ rules, regulations with the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That

is so subtle, that Congress is going to draw that

distinction between substantive rules and procedural

the notion that this is what Congress had in mind when

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL K. KATYAL

Congress enacted the Whistleblower Act to

of 60,000 people who are going to leak this information.

We're not in a Chevron situation in which the agency is

MR. KATYAL:

words are "notwithstanding FOIA," okay.

for the agent to withhold this information?

MR. KATYAL:

has said.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because you think it's

8

­­ that you think it's ­­ that particular types of

9

matter to be withheld.

10

You agree with the government

that that includes this kind of material.

11

MR. KATYAL:

It very well may satisfy FOIA,

12

particularly because of the first clause, which is

13

"notwithstanding FOIA."

this.

15

like that and so for that reason it's not specific.

16

So you don't have to deal with

1

worry about adopting the FOIA one is, as Justice Scalia

2

was pointing out to my friend,that this statute

3

affirmatively distinguishes in (b)(8) between "law, rule

4

5

second.

6

that rules and regulations don't themselves do the

7

prohibiting.

8

"specifically prohibited by law."

9

like that in FOIA.

And I think Congress is saying, unlike FOIA,

It is only law.

That is why the phrase is
There isn't anything

And, indeed, FOIA has two purposes,

as this Court in Robertson said, one of which is to

11

empower agencies.

about empowering agencies ­­

position is that after Congress enacted these statutes,

18

MR. KATYAL:

That's

No, no, not at all, Your Honor.

19

I think that as long as it has a notwithstanding clause,

20

as many things even before the Whistleblower Protection

21

Act did have, or it has a specific prohibition about

22

specific matters to be disclosed, unlike the general

23

airline flights, but, for example, 10 U.S.C. 2640(h)

that he instead contacted a reporter working for a

I know that.

18

circumstance that Justice Alito's posited, in which you

19

have 60,000 people who might leak to foreign media or

something like that.

21

that, they can solve that problem literally today by

22

walking out of this courtroom, having an executive order

23

that says SSI material, like the material here, air

25

Protection Act.

JUSTICE ALITO:

That may be.

But I doubt that if

Congress had thought about the situation that I posited,

6

they would be content with the possibility of a

7

disclosure that wasn't really a disclosure to the full

public.

9

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think, Justice Alito,

10

Congress has dealt with this question about how to

11

whistleblow, do you need an exhaustion requirement, and

12

so on, and other things.

13

they've amended the Act four times.

14

time, they've said the problem is not too many

15

whistleblowers, it's too few.

16

really hard for someone like Mr. MacLean, other

17

whistleblowers, to go to the media because they put

18

their job at risk, they get fired.

19

to spend years litigating, as this litigant has, just to

20

get his job back.

They have in 114(r).

The question before the Court here

Protection Act?

3

enough to deal with the Whistleblower Protection Act?

5

Have they done something specific

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm a little concerned

6

about your acceptance of the hypothetical that the

whistleblower doesn't blow the whistle to anybody except

don't you think it's implicit in that he's disclosing it

an enemy?

17

MR. KATYAL:

It may very well be precisely

18

right.

19

standard is, that's a constant in this case.

20

the extent the Court is worried about it at all, I think

21

Congress in (b)(8) provided mechanisms to deal with

22

that, either a specific or nonspecific order or an

23

executive order that doesn't require classification.

doesn't require mucking up at all the classification

question presented.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

There are three reports.

14

One is really for you, and that's the conference report.

15

The Senate report is somewhat against you because it

picks up the FOIA ­­ or the FOIA exemption, and says

2

3

already is supple enough to provide that, as long as it

4

is in the defense of the homeland, as your hypothetical

5

would.

6

As our

And more to the point, this Court's decision

7

in Eagan, which my friend cites, says that the

8

classification regime is entirely a creature of the

9

executive and can be modified at will.

So if they

10

really believe that you need to do this and share even

11

classified information with uncleared parties, they can

12

do that.

13

But I think ­­ so we're not requiring some

But again, I think ­­ I

6

think the FOIA context is very different than here

7

because FOIA is something about empowering agencies to

restrict disclosures.

14

those ­­ for those who ­­ who are focused on the text,

15

because the statute distinguishes, in the first part,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that suggests that we

14

take, essentially, the same language and read it two

15

different ways, just dependent on our sense of the

purpose of the underlying statute.

17

MR. KATYAL:

Well, I think that is available

to the Court.

and there is no way ­­

Is that right?

But again, you can use the FOIA standard

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I'm just asking if we ­­

21

your decoupling argument is essentially based on the

notion that these two statutes have very different

purposes and, therefore, we can take those very

different purposes and read the very, very similar

language differently.

Yes, Justice Kagan, for

purposes of 114(r), which, of course, bothers to specify

MR. GERSHENGORN:

1

I'd like to make two principal points.

2

First, the question here is whether ­­ the principal

3

question I'd like the Court to decide is whether this

4

disclosure was specifically prohibited by statute.

5

believe it is, and I think it's very interesting today

6

­­ Justice Kagan, you pointed out that the precedent

7

seems to require that.

8

that the legislative history in the Senate report seems

9

to require that result.

We

Justice Breyer, you pointed out

Justice Alito and Justice

10

Kennedy, you pointed out that the practical effects of

11

Respondent's position would seem to be grave.

12

Justice, you pointed out and we completely agree that

13

the term "specific" which is critical to their argument

14

could just as easily, and we think properly, mean

15

express, which is what it means here.

16

Scalia, you asked about criminal penalties, but the

17

statute itself does not provide criminal penalties just

18

as Mr. Katyal said, but it does provide civil penalties.

19

Mr. Chief

And Justice

We think in that situation where you have

20

the prior case law, the legislative history, the

21

practical effects and the plain text that to say that a

22

statute that mandates nondisclosure regulations does not

23

specifically prohibit disclosure is just a very odd

24

construction.

25

The principal practical arguments we've

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

heard today are that we don't have to worry because

2

Congress could have had an executive order to make it

3

work.

4

SSI system doesn't work under Mr. Katyal's construction.

5

The idea that what Congress expected was a duplicative

6

executive order to mimic the SSI scheme seems very odd

7

to us, and seems like a very odd way to construe

8

congressional statutes.

9

We continue to think there is no dispute that the

There was a concern here that there's this

the Whistleblower Protection Act, but it has no

12

application here, where Congress itself mandated the

nondisclosure regulations, and did so knowing precisely

14

what those regulations were when it did so.
