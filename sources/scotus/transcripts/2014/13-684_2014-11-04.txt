Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
The narrow question in this case is whether

12

the Truth in Lending Act rescission provision in 1635(a)

13

requires borrowers to file a lawsuit to exercise their

14

right to rescind.

15

appeals should be reversed for three reasons:

16

language of Section 1635(a); the statutory context of

17

1635; and the long­standing regulatory interpretation by

18

the two agencies who have been charged with

19

administering the provision.

The answer is no, and the court of
The plain

20

I'd like to start with the plain text of

21

1635(a), and we've set out the language in the first

22

page of our addendum to the blue brief, where a couple

23

of things are quite important to take note of.

24

One is that the rescission right, the

25

mechanism that is set forth in the statute is by

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

notifying the creditor, and that's true whether the

2

rescission occurs within 3 days or 3 years of the

3

closing of the loan transaction.

4
5
6

The second thing that's important to point
out ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, let's talk ­­ let's

7

talk about the first thing you say rescission is

8

affected by.

9

common usage to, for instance, one could say on Election

Okay?

It seems to me that it's ­­ it's

10

Day you vote by going to the precinct and presenting

11

identification.

12

a preliminary step to your voting, and I think that it's

13

possible to read the "by giving notice" as ­­ as to say

14

where ­­ where that's the only thing you have to do, as

15

it is for the 3­day cancellation rescission, that's the

16

end of it.

17

Now, that is not how you vote.

That's

But where there is something else to be

18

done, where you have to return whatever you have

19

received under the ­­ under the transaction, it seems to

20

me more reasonable to read it as, you know, you vote by

21

presenting yourself at the precinct and ­­ and offering

22

identification.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Congress could have

24

written Section 1635(a) that way, but it didn't.

25

when it wrote "by notifying," even if it was within the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

3­year period, Justice Scalia, it also provided that it

2

had to be done in accordance with regulations of the

3

Bureau.

4

the Federal Reserve Bank took exactly the same position

5

that we're arguing now, which is that the notification

6

to the lender could occur in a writing, and they used

7

their regulations to spell out the various ­­

8
9

And when Regulation Z was promulgated in 1969,

JUSTICE SCALIA:
wait.

Well, wait, wait, wait,

By notifying in accordance with regulations, it

10

seems to me that speaks to the manner of notifying, not

11

to the consequence of notifying.

12

indeed say what the consequence is, but I don't think

13

that the statute authorizes Regulation Z to say that.

14

MR. FREDERICK:

And Regulation Z may

Well, the statute actually

15

does say that in the (b) provision, Justice Scalia.

16

We'll get to that in a moment.

17

But the point here is that nowhere in

18

1635(a) did Congress say you had to file a lawsuit, and

19

nowhere in Regulation Z is there a provision that a

20

borrower has to file a lawsuit in order to rescind.

21

remember, the definition of rescission is a unilateral

22

cancellation of the transaction.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And

Yes, but ­­ but in common

24

law you had to give back in what you had received, and

25

you have ­­ you ­­ you are urging that the statute

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

creates a system in which a ­­ a creditor who has a

2

secured interest, simply because somebody comes up

3

almost 3 years later and says, you didn't give me two

4

copies of this particular document, I got only one copy,

5

and even if that's not true, immediately the secured

6

interest is converted into an unsecured interest.

7

is a huge difference.

8

believe that that's what Congress intended.

9

That

And I find it difficult to

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, the language of the

10

statute actually makes that very clear, and so do the

11

regulations.

12

places in three successive sentences in 1635(a, Congress

13

said the manner of rescission is going to be done in

14

accordance with regulations, the disclosures that need

15

to be done have to be done in accordance with

16

regulations, and there have to be appropriate forums for

17

the obligor to exercise his right to rescind.

18

is also set forth in the regulations.

19

And notably, Justice Scalia, in three

And that

So I don't think 1635(a) could be any

20

clearer that it is notification by writing in accordance

21

with the regulations set forth by the Federal agency.

22

Again ­­

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you just explain how

24

you ­­ how you think this would play out?

25

obligor sends a letter and says:

So the

I'm rescinding, and

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

then the creditor fulfills its obligations, and then the

2

obligor is required to tender the property?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Correct.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what if the obligor says

5

at that point, I don't have it, I've spent it.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Okay.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Then what happens?

8
9

So ­­
So the

rescission is rescinded?
MR. FREDERICK:

The statute answers that

10

question, Justice Alito, in 1635(b), and that's the

11

second page of the addendum to our blue brief.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

How does it answer it?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

It answers the question by

14

making clear that the process that you set forth is

15

what's supposed to happen automatically, but then the

16

very last sentence, which reads, "The procedures

17

prescribed by this subsection shall apply except when

18

otherwise ordered by a court."

19

in 1980, 12 years after the Truth in Lending Act was

20

originally promulgated.

21

added that sentence was because there had been case law

22

that raised the problem that you are identifying.

That sentence was added

And the reason why Congress

23

So what that sentence is intended to do is

24

to give courts the flexibility to reorder the various

25

provisions or slow things down so that the tender back

actually happens in a way that does ­­ is not unfair to

2

the lender.

3

And we've not found a single case in the

4

45­year history of this Act where the borrower has

5

gotten any kind of windfall.

6

hard at this.

We've looked extremely

7

But notably, the reason why this precision

8

happens this way, there's a rationale for it, and the

9

rationale is that after the borrower has put forth all

10

this money to get the loan in the first place, unless

11

the borrower can get back those proceeds and have the

12

security interest released, it's virtually impossible,

13

or extremely difficult, to get a refinancing on the

14

property.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, suppose ­­ suppose

23

take it at that point, the bank could say your State

statute of limitations has run?

25

Then the borrower sues.

MR. FREDERICK:

That ­­ that's right.

8
Alderson Reporting Company

I

But

Official

1

the way that your hypothetical most commonly arises,

2

Justice Kennedy, is in judicial foreclosure States, and

3

that would be where the bank would wait for a period of

4

time before bringing a foreclosure action in court, and

5

then the borrower would assert the rescission as a

6

defense, as an affirmative defense, like the Beach v.

7

Ocwen situation, except that in your hypothetical, the

8

borrower had timely sent the written notification of

9

rescission in time, within the 3­year period, and so,

10

therefore, would have preserved the right to rescind as

11

an affirmative defense.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So ­­ so the borrower has

13

to send its notice that it's not ­­ does not agree with

21

MR. FREDERICK:

No, the bank under the

22

procedures in Section (b) has 20 days in which to

23

tend ­­ to pay back the loan proceeds that had been

24

conferred to the borrower.

25

practice is that the bank takes its 20 days, and if it

So the way this works in

Alderson Reporting Company

1

investigates the loan file and it comes to the

2

conclusion that it has an argument that the borrower has

3

improperly sent a notice of rescission, it does what the

4

bank did here, which is to write a letter back and say:

5

We contest or we dispute your rescission.

6

The question is, in this case, did the

7

Jesinoskis timely send their written notification of

8

rescission in the face of that, and our position is that

9

the court of appeals was wrong.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. FREDERICK:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And even for

the ones who do, they could do the same thing?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

And in

nonjudicial foreclosure States, where ­­ to go back to

7

your hypothetical, Justice Kennedy, there's ­­ there's a

harder wrinkle on this.

19

lot of sense in the real world, where these kinds of

20

written notifications provided by the expert agency

21

charged with administering it create a simple process by

22

which the rights of both sides can fairly be determined.

23

That's been the way this statute has been understood up

24

until very recently when the circuit conflict developed,

25

really, in response to this Court's decision in Beach.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Before ­­ before you do,

4

Mr. Frederick, you are recognizing that the only

recourse the lender has if the borrower is ­­ is

Actually, I don't agree

The borrow ­­ lender has

12

13

we're in a judicial foreclosure State or a nonjudicial

14

foreclosure State.

First, it notifies the lend ­­ the

And then it depends really on whether

15

In the judicial foreclosure States, the next

16

thing that's likely to happen is that the bank would go

17

to State court and file a foreclosure action, at which

18

point the validity of the rescission notice would be the

19

first issue that would be decided by the court in

20

determining whether or not the foreclosure was proper to

21

begin with.

22

But if we're in a nonjudicial disclosure

23

State, and we're roughly 50/50 among the States in terms

24

of which are which, then we have the problem that I was

25

identifying with Justice Sotomayor, where the buyer is

1

going to have to take the initiative to go to court to

2

get a declaratory judgment that it had ­­ he or she had

3

properly rescinded the loan.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So why do you think it is

5

that Congress didn't say how we resolve disputes in this

6

context?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I think that the ­­

8

the answer to that is that Congress expected that this

9

unilateral right of rescission was going to be exercised

10

in a simple way through the written notification and

11

that what has happened is ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Congress couldn't have

13

thought that every time there was a notification, the ­­

14

the lender was going to agree with the borrower that it

15

was appropriate.

16

that there were going to be some cases where the lender

17

and the borrower disagreed, and yet Congress didn't say

18

anything about how those cases would be resolved and

19

that's a puzzling feature of this statute.

20

Congress must have thought that ­­

MR. FREDERICK:

It is a puzzling feature,

21

Justice Kagan, and I can't deny that.

22

that Congress revisited the language of the statute four

23

times after its initial enactment in 1974 and 1980 and

24

1995 and in 2010, and it never changed the mechanism of

25

rescission that it set forth in the original provision

13
Alderson Reporting Company

But I can say

Official

1

of 1635(a).

2

expiring the right, which it did in (f) and it did that

3

in 1974, it provided a termination of the right which we

4

think dovetails with (a).

5

And so when it put in these provisions like

And if you look at the two key linguistic

6

points here, the obligor's right of rescission ­­ this

7

is in (f) now, and I'm on page 4 of the addendum to our

8

blue brief ­­ really tracks the language of right to

9

rescind in (a).

And when it says in (a) "this section,"

10

the right to rescind in "this section," when Congress

11

subsequently enacted (f) to put the expiration of three

12

years, it's mirroring that language when it says, "the

13

obligor's right of rescission."

14

And then secondly in (f), when it says, the

15

information and forms required under this section is

16

also a mirror to what had been put forth in (a) where it

17

provides that there are disclosures and forms that are

18

going to be promulgated under the regulations.

19

So in that regard, I think what Congress was

20

trying to get at was to keep the process simple.

21

there was going to be litigation, as there invariably

22

has, courts would be able to sort that out using what

23

they added in 1980, which is the last sentence of

24

subsection B, which is to give the Court some

I think, what Congress primarily intended when it set up

that that notice of rescission could someday be enforced

It would depend on what I wanted to do.

If

14

I wanted to foreclose, for instance, on the property and

I needed my security interest to be absolutely rock

solid in order to do that, then I might be bring a

17

declaratory judgment action or I might, in the context

18

of the foreclosure, ask the court to declare that the

19

rescission was invalid.

20

What Section 1635(f) does is it gives the

21

lender the power to eliminate any uncertainty if it

22

feels the need to do so in a particular case.

23

Section 1635(f) existed, the borrower could rescind

24

basically, indefinitely.

4

They couldn't just file a lawsuit saying,

What Section 1635(f) does is it creates

5

adversity, essentially.

6

borrower has exercised the right to rescind or believes

7

that it's does so validly and now there's adversity

So the uncertainty is cabined by Section 1635(f).
JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Frederick just said that

13

what has happened in a lot of these cases is like

14

mini­bankruptcy proceedings in State court.

15

16

MS. GOLDENBERG:

Is that

Well, I think what's

17

happened under Section 1635(b) is that courts have taken

18

that last sentence of Section 1635(b) as essentially the

19

power to do equity in a particular case.

I don't think

20

the unwinding procedures are rescission.

I agree with

21

what Mr. Frederick said, that the definition of

22

rescission is the annulment, abrogation, cancellation of

23

the contract.

24

What follows from rescission is a common law

25

restitution under this statute, the restitutionary

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

procedures of Section 1635(b), but I think the exercise

2

of the right to rescind amounts to rescission.

3

again, I think you can get that directly out of the

4

statute, and I'm now looking at the same provision I was

5

referring to before.

6

sentence:

7

rescind under Subsection (a), then the security interest

8

becomes void upon such a rescission."

9

the exercise of the right to rescind as the rescission,

And

Section 1635(b) says in its first

"When an obligor exercises his right to

So it's treating

10

as the thing that is canceling or unmaking the contract,

11

and then what flows from that are various entitlements

12

under Section 1635(b) that are analogous to the kind of

13

restitution that you would get at common law.

14

As I say, I think Respondents' position has

15

a number of anomalies associated with it and it is not

16

consistent with the purposes of TILA.

17

to make things simpler and clearer for borrowers who are

18

being confused and duped and didn't fully understand

19

their rights.

20

is that there's essentially a hidden requirement that is

21

not in the statutory language, not in the regulatory

22

language, not in the forms that borrowers get, which

23

come from the agency, in which lenders get a safe harbor

24

if they use.

25

TILA was enacted

And what Respondents' position amounts to

So there is nowhere any explanation to the

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

borrowers that they have to file suit within this period

2

of time to exercise their rights, and that's very hard

3

to reconcile with what Congress was getting at under

4

TILA.

5

Also, to the extent that there's any doubt

6

about the interpretation of these provisions, we do

7

think that deference to the agency is warranted, both

8

with respect to the regulation, which was adopted as a

result of notice­and­comment rulemaking.

That's an

10

interpretation of the statute that makes a judgment that

11

the right to rescind is exercised the same way in every

12

context, whether it's in the first three days or at the

13

end of the 3­year period, and we think that's entitled

14

to Chevron deference, and if there were any doubt about

When a borrower sends a notice of intent to

These are all

Mr. Waxman, please review

11

what you just said because, as I understand it, the

12

13

to rescind which says, the borrower may cancel.

14

By notifying the lender at the lender's place of

15

business by mail or telegram, period.

1

3

if ­­ and again, I think this is what the government

4

conceded, that if the borrower's notice is untimely, and

5

the notice that's provided at closing tells you the

6

periods of time in which it is timely, it doesn't do

7

anything.

8

The rescissionary process is triggered.

But

And after 3 days, that is within 3 days of

9

the consummation, the question of whether it's timely or

10

not depends upon whether the lender violated TILA at the

11

closing, and where the lender says, as happened here, I

12

am holding your signed acknowledgment that you received

13

these forms, their position, the plaintiffs' position,

14

depends on a construction of the statute that says even

15

if ­­ once that notice is sent, even if it is completely

16

invalid, the security interest is vitiated, the lender

17

is required to return all monies paid, you know, except

18

in an instance ­­ I suppose, this is not textual ­­ in

19

which the bank runs in and tries to get a TRO.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

position that the government has.

rescission means today, and how the rescissionary

14

There is no dispute among any parties that

when a valid, timely notice is filed, that triggers the

rescission.

17

there is also no dispute, as Ms. Goldenberg said, that a

borrower's notice doesn't do anything unless the notice

was timely and otherwise valid.

20

It triggers the rescissionary process.

And as to the three­day period, let ­­ let

(Laughter.)
JUSTICE SCALIA:

As I understand your case,

11

you're ­­ you're drawing a distinction between

12

exercising the right to rescind and obtaining

13

rescission.

Is ­­ doesn't your case hinge on that?

14

MR. WAXMAN:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.
That ­­ that the notice is

16

simply an exercise of your right to rescind, but

17

rescission does not occur until there's the exchange

18

that the common law?

19

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

And correlatively, the

20

fact that an untimely or otherwise invalid notice

21

doesn't do anything.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, if ­­
But, Mr. Waxman, if that's

23

right, so exercising the right to rescind is by notice.

24

But then you look at (f) and it says, "an obligor's

25

right of rescission shall expire."

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

So I read that and I say, okay, that means

2

when you can no longer exercise your right to rescind,

3

which you've just said is when you can send notice.

4

that's what expires after three years, your ability to

5

send notice.

6

MR. WAXMAN:

No, I think it's not.

What it

talks ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it just says right there

it's the right to rescission shall expire, and you agree

10

that exercising the right of rescission is done by

11

notice.

12

So

MR. WAXMAN:

The ­­ as the ­­ no.

As this

13

Court explained in multiple places in Beach, all of

14

which are dicta, admittedly, the operation of (f) not

claim, and, therefore, it necessarily, quote, "limits

And so in a circumstance in which a notice

is sent, which is a notice of intent to rescind under

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because ­­
Since the ­­ the filing of

the lawsuit no more determines the validity of the

17

notice than it was determined three days before.

18

MR. WAXMAN:

Because ­­ because 1635(f)

19

refers to the obligor's right of rescission and where

20

the obligor has not obtained the rescission that he or

21

she claims he has a right to, he can go to a court for

22

an award of rescission and the statute tells him, you

23

have to have a live underlying right of rescission

24

before you invoke the court's jurisdiction to do it,

25

which is exactly what happened at the common law in

43

these circumstances.
Now, I just want to say that I think, you

3

know, the other side says, well, we're making a big

4

distinction between whether the notice is sent within

5

three days or after because somehow nobody could believe

6

that a lawsuit would be filed within three days.

7

1635(a) doesn't govern when a lawsuit is

filed.

rescind has to be sent.

It governs when the notice of an intention to

there is a refinancing with the original lender, which

that within the ­­ what Congress understood was it was

6

three­day period rescission is pretty uncomplicated,

because the ­­ the Board and the Bureau in the

Now, what happens in this case, in a case

You may not do it during the
