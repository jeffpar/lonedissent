Mr. Lindstrom.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AARON D. LINDSTROM

9

ON BEHALF OF STATE PETITIONERS

10

MR. LINDSTROM:

11

it please the Court:

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

EPA's view that it can decide whether to

13

regulate electric utilities without considering costs is

14

contrary to the text and structure of Section 7412.

15

The text sets out two distinct terms and

16

thus directs EPA to consider whether it is appropriate

17

to regulate and whether it is necessary to regulate.

18

EPA found that it's necessary to regulate because of the

19

existence of public health harms, and it found it's

20

appropriate to regulate for the exact same reason, the

21

existence of public health harms.

22

So its interpretation ­­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, I'm not sure that

24

that's quite what EPA said.

25

EPA said is that it's necessary because of public health

My understanding of what

Alderson Reporting Company

1

harms and that it's appropriate because there are

2

technologies that can redress or remedy those public

3

health harms.

4

said that the phrase "appropriate" went to the nature of

5

the harms.

6

the nature of the harms.

7

to the existence of technologies.

8

So on the one hand, it said that ­­ it

The phrase ­­ the phrase "necessary" went to
The phrase "appropriate" went

MR. LINDSTROM:

Justice Kagan, when they

9

relied on the availability of controls, they did that

10

only after having already said that we must find it's

11

appropriate if a health hazard exists.

12

already determined that the health hazard is a necessary

13

and sufficient condition so the existence of controls is

something that's not ­­

This is the text

I misspoke the first

206 says, "We must find" ­­ at the top of the

10

page ­­ "We must find it appropriate to regulate EGUs

11

under Clean Air Act Section 112 if we determine that a

12

single HAP emitted from EGUs poses a hazard to public

13

health or environment."

14

They said we must regulate.

And the phrase

15

"must regulate" means that when you get back to the

16

availability of controls, then there's nothing left to

17

be done.

18

the availability of controls isn't doing any additional

19

work.

You've already said that we have to do it so

The over ­­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is the government going to

22

say that if the predicate for regulation exists, i.e.,

23

there are emissions, then it's appropriate to regulate?

24

That's what the government will say.

25

"appropriate" is a capacious term.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean, that's ­­

Official

1

MR. LINDSTROM:

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

It absolutely is.
And it would seem to me

3

that the government will say, well, it's appropriate to

4

regulate if there's an emission, so ­­

5

MR. LINDSTROM:

It is a capacious term, but

6

it, in fact, cuts against the government because one of

7

the things that's encompassed within the term

8

"appropriate" is that it looks at all of the

9

circumstances in the context of determining whether or

10

not you're going to regulate costs is a relevant

11

circumstance.

12

against them.

13

So the very fact that it's capacious cuts

But the fact that they're ­­ they've said we

must find it's appropriate to regulate means that this

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I thought ­­
Are you saying that they

18

didn't ­­ that they didn't look at the availability of

19

technologies?

20

thought that the availability of technologies was itself

21

irrelevant to the determination?

Is that what you're saying?

That they

Is that your argument?

22

MR. LINDSTROM:

9

didn't know whether the technology that was going to be

12

listing wasn't necessary.

13

I had a different understanding of

the effects, and the only place they looked at severity

And the fact that they said we

11

the same as what they said with appropriate, that we

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can ­­ can I step back for a

14

minute, General Lindstrom?

Because it seems to me that

15

this quest for very particular meanings attached to each

16

one of these adjectives; "appropriate" means X and

17

"necessary" means Y.

18

mean, that kind of language is used all over the U.S.

19

Code and, indeed, that kind of language is used in our

20

Constitution, the Necessary and Proper Clause.

21

If we step back a little bit, I

And as I understand what courts have done

22

with that kind of language, that they haven't insisted

23

that there be separate, defined meanings for each of

24

those words.

25

McCulloch, in fact, he starts off with the word

When John Marshall was doing this in

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

"necessary" and then he says, no, this is a phrase and

2

we have to understand what the phrase as a whole means.

3

And why shouldn't we similarly say this idea that, you

4

know, you can catch them in a redundancy or a superfluity,

5

it's just not right because it's a complete

6

phrase.

7

MR. LINDSTROM:

I think there's two

8

responses to that.

9

and Proper Clause, if you look at what this Court did in

First of all, under the Necessary

10

Printz v. The United States, it recognized something

11

might be necessary and not necessarily proper.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Exactly.

The

We ­­ we have

separated out the two words and ­­ and said something

16

could be necessary and not proper.

17

said was that necessary doesn't mean absolutely

different from saying that proper has no ­­ has no role

3

4

treating them as doing the exactly the same work,

5

they're reading a word out of the statute.

6

deference doesn't extend so far as to say we can violate

7

an ordinary rule of statutory construction, which is

8

that independent words have ­­

9

The language I should have pointed you to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the ­­ by

And Chevron

But the word ­­ the word

10

"appropriate," often it's a signal that discretion

11

is what's fitting and you have an expert agency.

12

word "appropriate," I think, is commonly used to

13

indicate that the expert agency will do what it finds

14

fit based on its expertise.

15

are saying that appropriate necessarily embodies a cost

16

calculation and yet this is a statute that uses cost,

17

directs EPA to consider costs multiple, multiple times.

18

So the

So, how you ­­ well, you

Is there any case in all ­­ all of our

19

decisions where we have said even though there was no

20

instruction to consider costs, EPA is required to

21

consider costs?

22

Is there any such decision?

MR. LINDSTROM:

I don't think this ­­ no, I

23

don't think this issue has arisen the same way where

24

Congress has given broad discretion to an agency, told

25

them to look at all of the circumstances, and the agency

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

has said, we're going to ignore what is an important

2

part of the problem.

3

Judge Kavanaugh looked at it, this is a problem under

4

Chevron Step 1, 2 or under the State Farm doctrine,

5

because agencies are supposed to not ignore an essential

6

part of the problem as they engage in reasoned

7

decision­making.

8

And that's why, in the way that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think what Justice

9

Ginsburg is getting at, General Lindstrom, is, you know,

10

sometimes what we've done is we've looked at silence and

11

we've said given that silence, cost considerations are

12

precluded, right?

13

Sometimes we've said silence still allows agency

14

discretion.

15

it's so far from our most closely analogous case, which

16

is Whitman, to say not only is ­­ is cost

17

considerations, you know, not precluded, it's ­­ it's

18

required when there's silence as to that subject.

19

So that's the example in Whitman.

They can do what they want with it.

But

Now, if Congress wanted to require

20

something, and clearly, Congress required this in other

21

places, Congress knows how to require consideration of

22

costs, to get from silence to this notion of a

23

requirement seems to be a pretty big jump.

24
25

MR. LINDSTROM:

And Justice Kagan, I don't

think it is silent when it tells the agency to look at

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

all of the circumstances.

2

in the context of the question that the agency has to

3

answer is should we regulate under this section, costs

4

are part of the relevant materials ­­

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And the material circumstance

I'm not even sure I agree

6

with the premise that when ­­ when Congress says nothing

7

about cost, the agency is entitled to disregard cost.

8

would think it's classic arbitrary and capricious agency

outrageously expensive and ­­ and in which the expense

vastly exceeds whatever public benefit can be ­­ can be

JUSTICE ALITO:

They look at

It ­­ it seems to me that a

very salient feature of the statutes that we have to

10

interpret, maybe the most salient feature is that

11

Congress chose to treat power plants differently from

12

other sources.

13

and if it hadn't done that, then the ­­ the listing

14

decision would not have taken into account costs, it

15

would have been based on emissions, right?

16

It could have treated them the same way

Or if it was an area source, it would have

17

been based on effect of health alone.

18

anything, can we infer from that, from the fact that

19

Congress pointedly decided to treat power plants

20

differently?

21

MR. LINDSTROM:

So what, if

I think we can tell that

they're trying to create a different regime.

trying to do something different here than they did

that it's natural to take a look at the rest of the

statute and to say, let's regulate in a similar way to

the way all other industries are being regulated.

built in such a way that they have technology where it

was cost effective to include certain control measures.

imposing those same control measures on an older plant

AND RESPONDENTS IN SUPPORT
MR. BROWNELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to make three points to

11

supplement my colleague's argument:

12

the nature of power plant regulation under the Clean Air

13

Act; second, the language of Subsection (n)(1)(A); and,

14

third, the broader Clean Air Act context.

15

First, regarding

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

this program except for electric power plants.
MR. BROWNELL:

Your Honor, what it shows is

3

that for the other industries, EPA estimated in 2010

4

that for all other industries, this Air Toxics Program

5

would impose compliance costs of about $840 million.

6

All of these other programs for power plants would

7

impose compliance costs, EPA estimated in 2011, about

8

10.4 billion.

9

This single regulation now on air toxics

10

imposes annual costs of 9.6 billion.

11

get for it?

12

and I think that this is important to understand some of

13

the questions that have been asked.

14

for mercury, there's a regulation for nonmercury metals,

15

and there's a regulation for acid gases.

16

And what does one

There are three standards at issue here,

There's a regulation

Most of the costs here ­­ the majority,

21

that power­plant­related exposures are at least an order

22

of magnitude below the conservatively determined safe

The Acid Gas Program is

12

Now, what the statutory ­­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Brownell, can I take you

14

back to Justice Breyer's first question?

15

question was about the way these categories work and how

16

the categories enable the EPA to mitigate certain

17

dramatic or onerous costs on certain segments of the

18

industry, because that's not an unknown provision of any

19

kind.

20

very much cuts against your argument, because EPA, in

21

some ways, can't even figure out the costs until it

22

makes those categorization decisions.

23

costs, not just within each category, but the aggregate

24

costs obviously depend on how EPA categorizes and

25

subcategorizes.

And the first

calculation before it really can, given the structure of

4

MR. BROWNELL:

Your ­­ Your Honor, the cost

5

does factor into a variety of determinations that are

6

made as part of the regulatory process.

7

its Notice of Regulatory Finding in December of 2010, it

8

said this is nonfinal.

9

is at page 555a of the UAR Petitioner's Appendix ­­ that

When EPA issued

EPA confirmed again ­­ and this

the ­­ there is no final (n)(1)(A) determination or

11

listing, and we are going to take comment on that as

12

part of the rulemaking to examine Section 7412(d)

13

emission standards.

14

So as part of that, the agency addresses

15

issues related to level of control, subcategorization,

16

and at the end of the rulemaking comes out with a

17

regulation that has certain characteristics and

18

consequences.

19

(n)(1)(A) says is, in light of the study, address

20

whether such regulation under the section is appropriate

21

and necessary for power plants.

22

And here this regulation ­­ what

Now, it may be necessary to regulate

23

but that may not be the appropriate regulatory regime

2

if, as EPA has explained here, their view of the statute

5

subsection C is appropriate just like every other

MR. BROWNELL:

EPA does know what the costs are through the

rulemaking process in which it undertakes notice and

comment with respect to both the (n)(1)(a) determination

8

and the emission standard.

Clean Air Act lists subsection N as one of the

Section 7607(d)(1)(c) of the

10

provisions that requires notice and comment rulemaking

11

under the special Clean Air Act procedures.

12

why the agency explained that there's no final (n)(1)(a)

until the end of the process, until notice and comment

So what you're really saying to us is it's

22

not the listing.

My understanding of the basis for the decision below is

that costs are irrelevant in our determination under

Your Honor, when you say in

that regulation has certain characteristics and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL RESPONDENTS

8

GENERAL VERRILLI:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
EPA's interpretation of Section

11

7412(n)(1)(A) should be affirmed for three basic

12

reasons.

13

permissible reading of the statutory text which directs

14

EPA to focus on health concerns and doesn't mention

15

costs.

16

First, it is the most natural and certainly a

Second, it harmonizes the provision with

17

Section 7412's structure and design, because it applies

18

the same regulatory logic to power plants that Congress

19

directed EPA to apply to regulate hazardous air

20

pollution from every other type of source, and that is

21

decide whether to list for regulation based on health

22

and environmental hazards alone, and consider costs in

23

setting the emission standards.

24
25

And third, as a matter of common sense and
sound government practice, it was certainly appropriate

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

for EPA to list power plants for regulation based solely

2

on health and environmental hazards, because that

3

reflects the approach Congress chose not only in 7412,

4

in this regulatory program, but in all of the major

5

regulatory programs under the Clean Air Act.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I go to

7

your ­­ you're now three out ­­ your first ­­ first

8

point.

9

interpreted the statutory language to allow them to

10
11

You concede, don't you, that EPA could have

consider costs?
GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think EPA read it as ­­

12

read the best interpretation of the statute was it

13

didn't provide for the consideration of costs at the

14

listing stage ­­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But under Chevron,

16

if you adopted a regulation that said appropriate and

17

necessary allows us to consider cost, you think that

18

would be appropriate?

19

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I think the phrase

20

appropriate and necessary doesn't, by its terms,

21

preclude the EPA from considering cost.

22

Chevron, what the EPA has got to do is explain the

23

justification for its reading of the statute, and that's

24

what it did.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

42
Alderson Reporting Company

But under

Right.

But since

Official

1

you're dealing with the term, I think this says as

2

capacious as appropriate, and since you could have

3

issued a regulation allowing the consideration of costs

4

as appropriate, you're saying that the agency

5

deliberately tied its hands and said we're not going to

6

consider something.

7

we can't consider something that we could consider

8

otherwise.

9

We're going to issue a rule saying

GENERAL VERRILLI:

No, I think the best way

10

to think about this, Mr. Chief Justice, is what the

11

agency did was decide that it was appropriate to

12

approach the question of whether to regulate power

13

plants in the same manner that Congress found it was not

14

only appropriate, but mandated to address the question.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They could have ­­

16

I'm not ­­ I understand your argument that they could

17

have done that, but I think it's unusual for an agency

18

to say, when they want to do something, that that's the

19

only thing we could do.

20

maintain for themselves as much discretion as they can.

21

And it strikes me as unusual, maybe the agency could go

22

ahead and consider ­­ and not consider costs, but to say

23

that we're prohibited from considering costs under the

24

phrase appropriate, it strikes me as very unusual.

25

Agencies usually like to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It said, we

I thought ­­ I

7

thought the rule was that the phrase appropriate and

8

necessary did not allow them to consider costs.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And appropriate and

10

necessary goes to the question of whether power plants

11

should be listed for regulation under Section 7412,

which standards were set and costs are considered at the

I have the same question
Let me ask one more time.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Could

I don't think the

20

statutory text unambiguously forbids them from

21

considering costs.

22

reading of the statutory text is that power plants,

23

because after the study was conducted that Congress

24

required, EPA determined that power plants are no

25

differently situated than any other source of hazardous

But they determined that the best

air pollutants regulated under Section 7412.

2

And if I may Mr. Chief Justice?

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Sure.

4

GENERAL VERRILLI: For every other source of

5

hazardous air pollutants, what Congress mandated as

6

appropriate was that you do not consider costs when you

7

decide whether to regulate.

8

and environmental effects, and then you do consider

9

costs under Section 7412(d) when you set the emissions

10
11

You only consider health

standards.
JUSTICE ALITO:

How is that ­­ how is that

12

consistent with this statutory scheme?

If your argument

13

is that EPA's only reason for doing this is that it

14

wants to treat power plants the same as other sources,

15

we know that that's what Congress didn't want or it

16

would have ­­ it would not have enacted the separate

17

provision for power plants.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

I agree, Justice Alito,

19

that Congress proposed different treatment for power

20

plants, but that doesn't answer the question.

21

asks the question.

22

treatment did Congress prescribe.

23

are arguing is that what Congress prescribed and mandated

24

was a cost­benefit analysis that does not apply to any

25

other source of hazardous pollutants.

That just

The question is what different

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, what Petitioners

Official

But that is not what the text of the statute

2

says, and it's not what the history reflects.

3

text of the statute says in (n)(1)(A) is that even

4

though for every other source, regulation would proceed

5

immediately; for power plants, there was uncertainty

6

about whether power plants emitted hazardous pollutants

7

at a level that would cause a problem, whether the acid

8

rain regulations would solve the problem, and whether

9

there were alternative control strategies available.

10

And so ­­ if I may.

11

EPA ­­ what Congress told EPA to do was to

judgment about that, it was to decide whether to list

Those go to health

And then once EPA was ­­ made a

20

the fact that Congress wanted at least to hold open the

21

possibility that power plants would not be listed even

22

if their emissions exceeded the levels that would result

23

in listing for other sources.

24

reason why they would treat them differently.

Perhaps you may disagree

with that, but it seems to me that ­­ that that's a

5

necessary inference from this statutory scheme.

6

If that is the case, what factor might

Congress have thought would justify allowing power

8

plants to emit more than would be permitted if they were

9

other sources?

10

Now, Petitioners have an explanation which

is costs, and they say that power plants have to bear a

12

lot of costs that other sources don't have to bear, in

13

particular the Title IV program.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

If all they were concerned

about was health, why wouldn't they impose on power

plants the same standard that's imposed on area sources?

Just ask EPA to determine whether there is ­­ I forget

because they will take it into account when they set

And at that point I read the thing about the

I've got the word "similar source," which

14

then can refer me back to the categorization of two

things earlier, as they say maybe, and then I have,

regulating you look at the top 12 generators and that's

the minimum standard.

this is a cost, and the cost is about two and­a­half

percent of revenues.

21

make is that the situation that Your Honor described in

23

case, the 12 percent rule, it's a technology­forcing

rule, the kind that Your Honor discussed in ­­ in your

point about subcategories.

if there were a situation in which one segment of the

industry was so vastly different from another segment of

the industry in terms of its economics, in terms of its

23

those into two separate subcategories and then you don't

calculate the best performing 12 percent, which is what

3

regulating the surrogates, regulating the surrogates, is

4

a well­recognized methodology that goes back decades,

5

that EPA has used for decades, that the D.C. Circuit has

6

upheld for decades, that that is a perfectly appropriate

7

way to ­­ to deal with getting at metals and ­­ and

8

other pollutants that would be hard to get at directly.

What EPA did with respect to mercury was

Part of the reason it didn't try to quantify

very difficult and challenging.

one of the key reasons that Congress adopted not only in

ON BEHALF OF INDUSTRY RESPONDENTS

24

MR. SMITH:

25

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

70
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

We agree with the government that the EPA

2

was not required to engage in a cost­benefit analysis

3

before making the initial listing decision to regulate

4

hazardous pollutants emitted by power plants from

5

power ­­ applying the appropriate and necessary

6

standard.

7

the beginning, clearly, Congress did think that power

8

plants needed to be treated differently, but what did

9

they give them?

And I ­­ I certainly want to acknowledge at

They gave them a 3­year pause in which

10

the EPA was instructed to take account of the health

11

effects of the particular pollutants emitted by power

12

plants, and it did this under an appropriate and

13

necessary standard.

14

And if I could address the issue of what

15

those two words mean in the reading of the EPA, I would

16

refer the Court to pages 226 and 227 of the National

17

Mining Association cert­petition appendix.

18

it's necessary to read from it, but what the EPA said

19

consistently throughout this record is we looked at two

20

things.

21

history that these chemicals are simply not harmful

22

enough to require any further regulation, that their

23

effects are negligible, and they looked at that issue

24

under the appropriateness rubric.

25

are harmful chemicals, particularly mercury.

I don't think

There was a claim made in the legislative

71
Alderson Reporting Company

And they said these

Official

1

In addition, under the appropriateness

2

rubric, they looked at the question of whether or not

3

there were technologies available to regulate them.

4

necessary rubric was used to look at the post­Clean Air

5

Act post­acid rain health effects that would persist.

6

So they said, A, these are harmful chemicals ­­ harmful

7

pollutants; and B, under necessary, they will continue

8

to be harmful after the Acid Rain Program has kicked in.

9

And that's how the Court ­­ the EPA saw the two

10

different words, and it's a perfectly logical way for

11

them to proceed.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Who ­­ who would have

13

guessed?

14

of ­­ of necessary and appropriate.

again.

16

Necessary means what?

17

MR. SMITH:

I mean, that seems such an artificial division
Why ­­ describe it

I really didn't ­­ didn't quite understand it.

that necessary means that there will still be health

MR. SMITH:

don't need to regulate here regardless of the effects.

read them.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's a silly way to read

them, I think.
MR. SMITH:

Perhaps so, Your Honor.

But the

13

key thing is, the issues that they were directed to

14

study, the issues that were then supposed to control the

15

listing decision were the health effects of the

16

pollutants that come out of these power plants.

17

they then deferred the issue of considering a cost to

18

the second stage just as occurs with every single other

19

source of the same 189 hazardous pollutants that they

20

were dealing with.

And

21

And if I could pause here and just clarify

22

one thing about what happened at that listing stage.

23

Natural gas­fired plants were not turned into a

24

category.

gas­fired plants and said we are exempting them entirely

They looked at the health effects of natural

from regulation under this section, under the

2

appropriate and necessary standard because they simply

3

don't emit these chemicals in more than trace amounts,

4

and there's simply nothing for us to regulate.

5

natural gas plants get taken out at the listing stage.

6

We then have coal­fired and oil­fired plants

So

7

as to which they begin to apply the subsection (d)

8

standards, standards which were designed by Congress to

9

limit the emission regulation to reasonable amounts,

10

designed because the floors are, in fact, limited to

11

what has already been achieved by comparable plants in

12

the same category.

13

Now, there was some question raised about

14

whether or not this categorization was something that

15

EPA recognized it could use to effect the emissions

16

standards and make them reasonable.

17

Mr. Brownell acknowledged, they did use ­­ create a

18

category ­­ a separate category of coal­burning plants

19

that burned Lignite, because it turns out that none of

20

the Lignite plants could meet the ­­ the standards that

21

would otherwise have ­­ have applied with respect to

22

mercury if they were in the category with the other

23

coal­fired plants.

Why they made the appropriate and

They were looking at the costs

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Are you saying that they

19

purported to make the categorization decision without

20

taking into account costs?

21

MR. LINDSTROM:

Yes, any categorization

22

they've done has already been done, and they didn't

23

consider costs.

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. LINDSTROM:

And didn't consider cost.
That's correct.

88
Alderson Reporting Company

And again,

Official

1

I'd like to return to one of the big picture principles,

2

which is, this is an administrative law case, so it does

­­ this turns or falls on what the agency actually did

below.

5

They've said costs are not relevant.

important part of the regulatory problem, and adopted ­­

7

So they've already actually made determinations.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They've ignored an

I'm sorry.

They

8

proposed categories, and everybody had the opportunity

9

to say it's the wrong category, correct?

10

MR. LINDSTROM:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12
13
14
15

Yes, Your Honor.
And argue why it's the

wrong category.
MR. LINDSTROM:

And the categories have been

adopted
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And some people

16

submitted complaints about costs relative to their

17

technology and their kinds of plants, correct?

18

MR. LINDSTROM:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes, Your Honor.
So, it's not true that

20

­­ they proposed them, but everybody gets a chance to

21

tell them, these are ­­ this technology is different

22

from the others, or this kind of plant is different from

23

the others, and it imposes a cost much greater than you

24

are anticipating.

25

MR. LINDSTROM:

I'm saying we're already

89

past that phase.

2

they were going to do has already been done.

3

They've already ­­ any categorization

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, what you're saying,

4

it's already past.

5

final rule has been issued.

It's past because that's been ­­ the

6

MR. LINDSTROM:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Correct.
I'm talking during the

8

rulemaking process.

9

the agency to consider the cost of technology in setting

10

up categorizations.

11

MR. LINDSTROM:

12
13

The rulemaking process does permit

They've adopted the exact

opposite position, which is that costs do not matter.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I thought we just

14

heard ­­ I thought we just heard that say the Lignite

15

people, I can't remember if that's the right name, but

16

they said, look, we have special ways of producing

17

this ­­ our stuff, and they are much more expensive, so

18

please don't put us in the same category as you put the

19

other people in.

20

the best 12 percent, and the agency said, right, okay,

21

separate.

Okay?

For the purposes of figuring

Now, did that happen?

22

MR. LINDSTROM:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
All right.

Then how would

24

you do that without considering cost?

25

basis was the Lignite people were saying our costs are

90

Because their

more expensive?
MR. LINDSTROM:

We don't know how they ­­ I

3

don't know how they did it, but they've said throughout

4

that we're not considering costs.

Thank you, Your Honor.
