CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. SPINELLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Respondents' position is that Section 506(d)

12

of the Bankruptcy Code allows Chapter 7 debtors to keep

13

their houses, strip their underwater mortgages, and

14

prevent their lenders from accessing any later

15

appreciation in a house's value.

16

rejected that position with respect to partially

17

underwater mortgages and that reasoning applies with

18

equal force to completely underwater mortgages.

19

In Dewsnup, this Court

Dewsnup held that Section 506(d) voids only

20

liens securing disallowed claims.

21

liens based on the current value of the collateral.

22

That logic applies whether the current value of the

23

collateral is a million dollars, $1 or zero, as

24

virtually every court to address the question has held,

25

and even the Eleventh Circuit below all but admitted.

3

It does not void

Outside bankruptcy, the bank would be

2

entitled to have its lien stay with the property until

3

foreclosure or payment in full.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the value of ­­

5

of an ­­ an under ­­ completely underwater second

6

mortgage?

7

the property will ever appreciate to the extent that it

8

will have real value?

cases in which the value of the house would need to rise

17

only by $4,000, where it would need to rise only by

18

19

upswing, it's very plausible and very likely that many

20

of these mortgages will regain equity.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do the holders of the

underwater, ever participate in negotiations with the

MS. SPINELLI:

Justice Sotomayor, the fresh

particular nature.

20

Chapter 7 is that the debtor surrenders all of his or

21

her assets and in return gets a discharge of all

pre­petition debt.

5

most sophisticated parties that can possibly be

6

7

to me that they would be making essentially a bet on ­­

9

what is the probability that Dewsnup will be extended to

completely underwater mortgages.
And presumably, they discounted all their

various calculations in order to take into account the

13

probability that another court would say, you know,

14

Dewsnup is not very persuasive, and we're just not

willing to extend it any further.

16

probably what Bank of America and other banks did, is

17

they said, you know, we think there is X percent chance

that Dewsnup will be extended and Y percent chance that

it won't, and they made their cost and pricing

Dewsnup held that a secured claim is a claim

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But ­­ but the idea

is that, you know, throughout a bankruptcy, you could

have a mortgage that is ­­ a lien that's underwater,

then totally underwater, then partially underwater.

the idea that you'd latch onto that as a distinction

seems to me to be a difficult proposition .

19

MS. SPINELLI:

That's exactly right.

And

I

20

mean, the nonbankruptcy right of a lienholder is to

21

retain its lien until payment in full or until

22

foreclosure, which means that the lienholder is entitled

23

to access any equity that may develop in the future due

24

to appreciation of the property to secure its lien.

3

Those provisions would make no sense if

4

506(d) were itself a lien­stripping provision.

5

to take one example, if one looks at Section

6

1325(a)(5) which appears on page 6A of the blue brief,

7

that sets out the terms under which a Chapter 13 debtor

8

can strip down liens, and it says that with respect to

lien, securing such claim until the earlier of the

13

14

Now, it would make no sense to permit the

15

lender to keep its lien until payment of the full debt

16

if the lien had already automatically been stripped down

17

under 506(d) to the value of the collateral, and that's
