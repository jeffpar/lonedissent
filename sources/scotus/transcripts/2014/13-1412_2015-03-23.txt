Justice Scalia, page 3 of our reply in support of

6

that the issue here is not a fact­intensive

7

reasonableness question, but instead, it's whether an

8

armed and violent individual's accommodation is

9

required.

And the answer to that is no, where the

10

significant risk hasn't been eliminated.

the Ninth Circuit on an argument that was never

presented to it?

3

MS. VAN AKEN:

I ­­ I disagree, Your Honor.

4

In the Ninth Circuit, San Francisco argued that the ­­

5

the Ninth Circuit should adopt essentially the Fifth

6

Circuit's rule, that where there are exigent

7

circumstances, that there is no requirement of

8

accommodation.

9

has nothing to do with arrests.

There was no argument that the ADA just
It's that in exigent

10

arrests, like the Fifth Circuit said in Hainze, then you

11

don't ­­ there's not a reasonable accommodation.

12

accommodation is reasonable.

13

No

So in a sense, the ADA doesn't apply, but

14

that's because of the exigency as the Fifth Circuit said

15

in Hainze, and that was the conflict that we asked this

16

Court to take the case to resolve.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Before we get to the

18

question that you have briefed and the question that the

19

Solicitor General has briefed, there is another question

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And that's a finding that

discrimination includes not making an accommodation.

5

and that the United States makes based on regulations

6

that have been issued pursuant to the statute.

But it

Well, I ­­ I think

14

discrimination includes the failure to make an

15

accommodation where it's reasonable to do so, and I base

16

that on the findings, as I mentioned.

the regulations, which this Court said in ­­ in Bragdon

18

were entitled to deference, at least in the ­­ the

public accommodations context.

which ­­ which was subsequently enacted but mentions

I base that on

that imprisoning someone is a public activity, and this

So the ­­ the ADA

adopts the Rehabilitations Act remedies, which in turn

13

the Ninth Circuit has expanded that to include

deliberate indifference as well.

15

that here if the conduct is purposeful, if the officers

are intentionally making an arrest rather than

ambush or some kind of barricade, and that's something

that the officers here testified they were concerned

The

No, I'm not talking about

I'm just talking about enforcing the law.

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Your Honor, but I do think

10

that, again, the statute has no exceptions, and this

11

Court ­­ the lower courts are in agreement, and it's

12

consistent with the Justice Department guidance, and

13

there is a good reason for that.

14

of Justice Kagan's hypothetical, that things like

15

providing an interpreter during the arrest of a deaf

16

individual, as this Court, in the case that was before

17

this Court about a decade ago in Gorman, providing

18

transportation for a wheelchair bound individual to the

19

police station, for conducting sobriety tests, have a

20

walk the line test for someone with physical

21

disabilities, those are the core kinds of things that

22

the ADA is designed to get at.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's along the lines

And do you also agree

24

with Ms. Van Aken that there is vicarious liability,

25

because the ADA operates against entities, not

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

individuals, not officers.

2

there is vicarious liability, rather than the

3

enterprise, the entity would be liable if it had a

4

pattern or practice.

5

So do you also accept that

MR. GERSHENGORN:

We do believe that,

6

Justice Ginsburg, that there is the effect ­­ the

7

effectively respondeat superior liability much of the

8

time will only be for injunctive relief, precisely

9

because in the absence of an intentional harm, damages

10

would not be available.

11

there is the equivalent of respondeat superior

12

liability.

13

this case, but if I could just touch on one more issue

14

that hasn't been briefed in this case that the Court

15

should not resolve is Justice Alito's question about

16

reasonable accommodation.

17

But, yes, we do believe that

Of course, none of that has been briefed in

This Court said in Tennessee v. Lane, both

18

in Justice Stevens' majority opinion, and in Chief

19

Rehnquist's dissent that reasonable accommodation was

required by Title II of the ADA.

22

reasonable accommodation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So I think it's clear

It does seem to me that the

8

dynamics are different in the arrest context.

9

here, I guess the officers had reason to know that this

10

individual had a disability, but what happens if police

11

officers have to arrest somebody out on the street that

12

seems to be behaving in an unusual fashion.

13

they determine whether that person has a disability, it

14

may be someone who is schizophrenic and isn't taking his

15

or her medications, or it might be somebody who does not

16

have a mental illness, but has taken some kind of

17

controlled substance, how do they make those

18

determinations on the spot when they're arresting

19

someone.

20

MR. GERSHENGORN:

Now,

How can

So, the ADA applies when

21

you know or believe that the person has a disability,

22

including mental illness.

23

not apply.

25

there would be an issue about whether the officers

bizarrely, had a mental illness?

is because she was in her room, and she had made clear

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I ­­ I have a hard time

between the reg and the Government's special

7

doesn't say you have to change your procedures unless a

eliminate the risk.

that and special circumstance?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the

There I ­­ I agree with

Well, but I think the idea

8

of the government's test, Mr. Feldman, is this is an

Ms. Van Aken, you have three minutes
remaining.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTINE VAN AKEN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. VAN AKEN:

I'd like to make two points

6

in my very brief time.

7

the Court took this case because there's a division in

8

the circuits about the weight that they give to exigency

9

and safety concerns in dangerous arrests like this one.

The first is that I think

10

I don't think there could be any question that in the

11

Fifth Circuit, in the Fourth Circuit, where exigency has

12

a lot of weight in the reasonableness analysis, that

13

this case would have come out differently.

14

that's the fundamental legal difference between the

15

circuits and between the parties.

And I think

16

What I heard Mr. Feldman say ­­ this is my

17

second point, and it goes to the reasonableness of an

18

accommodation.

19

reasonable to accommodate her if they could have

20

eliminated the risk, but the risk was eliminated when

21

the door was closed.

22

Solicitor General.

23

eliminated, because ­­ Mr. Feldman is incorrect that the

24

risk is eliminated because Ms. Sheehan, whether or not

25

she was fully contained, whether or not they had been

I heard him say that it would only be

And with respect, I agree with the
He's incorrect that the risk was

told by Mr. Hodge that there was no other exit, she

2

certainly was not visible.

3

she could have been gathering her other knives,

4

preparing an ambush, she had a cluttered room full of

5

household items, maybe there was a cup of bleach she

6

could throw in the face of the officers.

7

that the officers knew that they meant ­­ she meant them

8

harm, they knew that she did not intend to go peacefully

9

to the hospital, and they knew that at some point

And behind her closed door,

The point is

10

someone was going to have to go back in that room and

11

deal with the situation.

12

door could have been allowing her time to calm down, but

13

the officers had no way to know that.

And so delay behind a closed

14

The final point I want to make is that ­­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't that the point of

16

the treatment, though, to try to give it a chance?

17

mean, what your adversary has said is, we can't assume,

18

unless we want a society in which the mentally ill are

19

automatically killed, there's 350 people a year,

20

estimated, who are shot by police officers and killed,

21

who have mental illness.

22

there's a hundred police officers who are killed, almost

23

half of them from ambushes, and the other 50, I'm not

24

sure what the circumstances were, but not ambush

25

circumstances.

I

And this is not to minimize,

The point is, isn't the ADA ­­ and the

55

Official

1

House report makes this very clear ­­ intended to ensure

2

that police officers try mitigation in these situations

3

before they jump to violence.

4

MS. VAN AKEN:

Not where it increases safety

5

risks to the officers.

6

the point where they were deciding whether to go in or

7

not was to resolve a safety risk.

8

that increases a safety risk isn't reasonable as a

9

matter of law.

The nature of the activity at

So any accommodation

Thank you.
