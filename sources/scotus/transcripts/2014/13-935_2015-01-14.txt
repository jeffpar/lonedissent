ORAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE STEEGE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MS. STEEGE:

10

please the Court:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Stern v. Marshall held that a bankruptcy

12

judge may, consistent with Article III, enter judgment

13

in an action that stems from the bankruptcy itself.

14

The claim at issue in this case meets that

15

test.

16

first and most fundamental question that arises in every

17

bankruptcy case, what property became part of the debtor

18

Sharif's bankruptcy estate under Bankruptcy Code

19

Section 541 on the day Mr. Sharif filed for bankruptcy.

20

As this Court recognized over 100 years ago

Wellness asked the bankruptcy court to decide the

21

in Mueller v. Nugent, it is essential that bankruptcy

22

judges have that authority.

23

bankruptcy laws, there have been debtors like Mr. Sharif

24

who devised creative ways to keep property in their own

25

possession and out of the hands of their trustees and

As long as there have been

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

creditors.

2

Here, Mr. Sharif's case is ­­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we've already held

3

that a fraudulent conveyance against a noncreditor is an

4

Article III violation, is a Stern claim, essentially.

5

MS. STEEGE:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

why isn't this the same thing?

8
9

Yes, Your Honor.

MS. STEEGE:

Or non­Stern claim.

Because this action is a

case ­­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I mean, it's not the

11

same thing because he actually possessed this trust,

12

it's in his name as trustee ­­

13

MS. STEEGE:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

Yes.
­­ and so it's a little

bit ­­ it's a lot different, but ­­

16

MS. STEEGE:

Yes.

But the allegations of

17

the complaint were that Mr. Sharif owned the property

18

and to the extent the trust existed, it should be

19

ignored by virtue of the way he handled his property.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, but ­­ but that's

21

the same in a fraudulent conveyance.

22

property and he was just trying to deny his other

23

creditors the benefit of that money.

24

that.

25

So

MS. STEEGE:

It was his

So it's not quite

Well, it's different, Your

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Honor, because in a fraudulent transfer claim, the

2

debtor actually passes title over to someone, under the

3

definition of 548 or the ­­

4
5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But here, he's claiming

that the beneficiary has title.
MS. STEEGE:

Yes, but that's the very

7

dispute that the Court was asked to decide under

8

Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum, the issue is not what

9

the debtor claims his title is, but whether he has

10

actual possession.

11

have here are the condominium that he lives in and he's

12

lived in for 20 years, a pharmacy business, he's a

13

pharmacist, that he's been operating for many years and

14

that in the past, he had reported as his business on his

15

personal tax return; we have his own personal retirement

16

account that somehow inexplicably ended up in the

17

mother's grantor trust and then we have bank accounts

18

that he owned.

19

And so here ­­ the assets what we

And so the allegations of the complaint were

20

that he really owned this and this charade that he put

21

up in front of the bankruptcy court of saying, this is

22

owned in a trust, that was the dispute the court had to

23

consider.

24
25

And a way, I think, to think of it as
differently from a fraudulent transfer action, where

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

you're going against a true third party to whom title

2

has passed, that chosen action, the intangible right to

3

sue on the fraudulent transfer claim, or as in Stern,

4

the right to bring the breach of contract or tort claim

5

in these other cases, that asset, the right to sue

6

exists in the estate at the time of its creation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

MS. STEEGE:

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

MS. STEEGE:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's what's claimed.
That's what's claimed, yes.
And so what would be the

13

effect of a declaration by the bankruptcy court that ­­

14

that Respondent was the alter ego; that it was actually

15

his property?

16

by that judgment?

17

the bankruptcy court as if she were a creditor?

18

The sister ­­ would the sister be bound

MS. STEEGE:

Would the sister have to appear in

Well, yes, she would be bound

19

because if we accept their characterization, the

20

trustee, through his litigation conduct, binds the

beneficiary under well­established Illinois law, the law

Would the –would the court,

7

the bankruptcy court, have had the power to notify her or to

8

subpoena her to come in as a party?

9

MS. STEEGE:

Yes, because if ­­ if she was a

10

necessary party to the action, the normal rules of

11

Federal Civil Procedure apply through the bankruptcy

12

rules and she would have been required to be brought in.

That's correct.
Can the bankruptcy court,

9

it happens here, that the claim is not Saudi Arabia, the

10

claim is not my cousin, the claim is that the $5 million

was a living trust of which there seems to be very

It's a simple claim.

of bankruptcy.

That was not the case in Stern.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, likewise there, what

5

was in the estate is a question of Federal law, even if

6

State law provided the answer.

7

MS. STEEGE:

The difference here would be if

8

there had been a dispute between the debtor and Stern

9

and her bankruptcy trustee over who got the right to go

10

sue Pierce, the ­­ the son­in­law, that would have been

11

this case.

12

That would have been the 541 question.

The chosen

action is what exists in the

13

estate at the time of its creation.

14

of action, when you go out and you seek to go liquidate

15

that, bring the lawsuit, that's the augmenting­type

16

claim that the Court has talked about in its precedent

in Stern and in Northern Pipeline.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

And so that chose

Suppose that Illinois law,

and suppose that Illinois law governs the ­­ this ­­ the

20

issue of the trust, and suppose Illinois law says that

that the trust is the trustee's alter ego, that the

property does not become the ­­ that the ­­ the property

at issue does not become the property of the trustee

25

until there is a judicial declaration that that ­­ that

10
Alderson Reporting Company

occurs.
MS. STEEGE:

Well, I don't think that

3

changes the analysis, because, ultimately, in a

4

bankruptcy case, if you're going to have to have a

5

dispute with the debtor ­­

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

question of the status of this under Illinois law ­­

So that's ­­ that would be a

Correct.
­­ not under Federal law,

right?
MS. STEEGE:

It would inform the decision.

12

But, ultimately, whether the property comes into the

13

estate or not is determined under Section 541.

14

the ­­ the court of appeals, who have addressed this

15

issue, and we list a number of those cases in the third

16

footnote in our brief, all are very uniform.

17

looking to State law in a variety of different contexts

18

to figure out what the debtor's rights are in the

19

property because that's the Butner decision of this

20

Court.

And so

They are

But, ultimately, when you make that final

22

determination that it is property of the estate, you

look to 541.

24

disputes over trusts be part of that 541 determination

25

by its inclusion of Section 541(d), which talks about

And Congress would have intended that

equitable title, which is directly, you know, driven

toward trusts because that's when you have a division of

title.

5

cover that.

And so it was intended that Federal law would

6

And I also think that, you know, a ­­ a key

7

difference between this and Stern in the form of claim

8

that we have here is this is being brought against the

9

debtor.

This isn't being brought against a third party

10

who's been hauled into bankruptcy court against their

11

will.

12

knowing by virtue of the statute that he or she will be

13

required to turn over their property to the bankruptcy

14

trustee; that there may be disputes over that.

15

there can be legitimate disputes.

16

necessarily just have to be a dishonest debtor, like we

17

would contend we have here.

18

be in front of the bankruptcy judge in the first

19

instance having those disputes determined.

20

The debtor has chosen to file a bankruptcy,

And

It doesn't

And that they're going to

It's part of the Federal scheme, exactly

21

what bankruptcy is supposed to accomplish, which is to

22

get all of the debtor's property put into the bankruptcy

23

estate for distribution to creditors.

24

central key point of every bankruptcy case.

25

That's the

And if you don't do that, you lose your

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

discharge like Mr. Sharif.

2

really is the flip side of the denial of his discharge,

3

which no one disputes the bankruptcy judge had the

4

authority to decide.

5

It really is ­­ this action

She couldn't decide if he should receive a

6

discharge if we didn't know what it was he was supposed

7

to be doing in the case in terms of the property that he

8

had.

9

And the two claims really overlap each

10

other; they're the flip side of each other.

11

I think this is different than a cause of action against

12

a third party such as you had in Stern or Northern

13

Pipeline or Granfinanciera and the like.

14
15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's why

But you've not explored

the consent question completely.

16

MS. STEEGE:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.
Basically the argument

18

that the SG and the ­­ of you and the SG is that you

19

need express consent ­­ or I guess the other side,

20

saying you need express consent and they didn't give

21

express consent.

22

MS. STEEGE:

How do you get around that?
Well, Your Honor, we think that

23

you don't need it.

24

implied consent is permissible.

25

upon the bankruptcy rule, Bankruptcy Rule 7012.

The Court has held and ruled that
The argument is based

And if

you look at Section 157(c), it uses the term "express

2

consent" and then just the term "consent."

3

connection with Section 157(c)(2), which deals with the

4

consent of a litigant to proceed to judgment on a

5

noncore Stern claim, it uses the word "consent."

6

we assume Congress meant to require express consent in

7

157(e) dealing with consenting to a jury trial right,

8

they must not have required express consent, and then we

9

have a rule that's going beyond what the statute

10

provides.

11

In

So if

That's exactly the situation in Roell.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We don't have to reach both

12

of these questions if we find one of them in ­­ in your

13

favor, do we?

14

MS. STEEGE:

That's correct.

If you don't

15

find it to be a Stern claim, then consent would not

16

matter.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which one is the better

18

one?

19

that you think has more real world effect?

20

Which is the prettier question or ­­ or the one

MS. STEEGE:

Well, I think the first

21

question has real world effect in the sense that if the

22

Court were to take away from bankruptcy judges the power

23

to litigate disputes with the debtor over what they

24

possess comes in or out of the bankruptcy estate, you'd

25

see a sea change in how cases were handled.

Alderson Reporting Company

Because

that's the basic dispute you're going to have with the

2

debtor.

You're going to have three disputes with the

3

debtor.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Even ­­ even if consent

5

were sufficient to confer jurisdiction?

6

that's ­­ maybe just to continue Justice Scalia's

7

question, are the bankruptcy courts more confused by

8

Question 1 or Question 2?

9

MS. STEEGE:

And that's ­­

I think there's a lot of

10

confusion out there, Your Honor, and I think that

11

certainly people are also concerned about the consent

12

question, because the situation that you have today is

13

that both parties could consent, and the bankruptcy

14

judge could enter a judgment, and then the party who

15

loses can turn around and say, well, there's a question

16

about whether I really consented or not or whether it

17

was appropriate.

Is there something that has to be told to

Congress didn't require that

here in Section 157, and, you know, it's a maxim of the

23

law that knowledge ­­ you know, lack of knowledge of the

24

law is no excuse.

parties have talked about that developed under the 1898

9

Act that ended up being a relatively reticulated system

10

11

which there are multiple categories in which the

bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction to make these

determinations.

14

facts like these where there was possession of the

15

property, which we think indisputably the trustee had

16

possession of the trust assets here, and that would be

17

enough to give the bankruptcy judge the jurisdiction ­­

18

19

to determine who had title.

judicial control in the sense that you have deferential

10

that when a trust ­­ a trustee of a trust declares

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you're just saying that

17

they didn't decide it correctly, but it's terribly easy

18

to imagine a different debtor who goes into bankruptcy

and he lists Item 1, 2, 3, and 4.

20

come in and say, you know, it's awfully surprising, four

21

or five, six months ago I have a similar list you gave

22

to the National Bank, and it had 10 items on it.

24

they didn't really belong to me.

whether a bankruptcy judge can litigate who owns Items 6

I imagine

would like to hear your reply.

16

MR. HACKER:

I ­­ I ­­ and I think the

17

example is a good one because I do think the trust is

18

very important because we do have decades of law on

19

that, but the example is not problematic because if in

that situation the trustee says, I see some other

21

bankruptcy trustee, sees ­­ I see some other property,

22

and the debtor says, that's not mine, I do think it's

true that there wouldn't be a litigable claim there

unless the third party also asserted ownership to the

property.

says, that's not the debtor's, that's all mine, I've had

it for years, that's my car, that's my boat, that's my

4

house, then I think it's absolutely clear that under

that circumstance the trustee could not extinguish the

distinguish the third party's rights by itself.

It

And, in fact, their first primary argument,

20

which pervades their reply brief, depends on the

21

proposition that the trust was a real entity because

22

what they're saying is a version of what you were

23

saying, Justice Sotomayor, which is that he had

24

possession because he was the trustee of the trust.

25

possession only exists because he's a trustee of the

2

they're not in the trust, there's no tenable theory that

he is the ­­ on the face of the assets, that they start

5

somehow.

6

a trust and therefore he has sufficient possession.

7

The trust assets aren't listed in his name.

If

So their theory is, well, he's the trustee of

And our answer to that is simple.

Not one

8

case ever in the history of western law that anybody has

9

found says that trust assets go into the personal

10

bankruptcy estate of a trustee, if and when the trustee

11

declares bankruptcy, this Court said the opposite in

12

Hardenburg, it said the opposite in Whiting Pools in

13

saying that when you have only bare legal title, which

14

is at most the only thing a trustee has, only bare legal

15

title goes in and no other beneficial interests go into

16

the estate.

17

So then there's a second question, a second

18

argument, which is that well, because in 2002, not one

19

year, Justice Breyer, but seven years before the

20

bankruptcy, we have discovered these documents that

21

suggest that he was treating the trust as trustee was

22

treating the trust assets as his own.

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in the cases you just

cited, did the courts say who decides the question of

whether there's bare legal title?

13

you have brought me so far is these cases say ­­ what

14

they say is you have to ­­ you can't just grab it; you

15

have to proceed under Section 23 and have a proceeding.

16

But the ­­ the ­­ a proceeding ­­ some kind of a

proceeding, I don't know exactly what that kind is, you

18

probably do, but that doesn't mean the trustee doesn't

get it.

20

it's the trustee who decides, but I don't know what a

21

Section 23 proceeding is.

I mean, it's the trustee who litigates it out,

22

MR. HACKER:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. HACKER:

25

In the older cases ­­

­­ the rule that would apply,

Justice Kennedy, would be the Talburg v. Scott

40
Alderson Reporting Company

Kitzmiller rule, you have to have a plenary proceeding

2

to go get it.

A plenary proceeding.

But

That would have been ­­ it's

6

sort of the equivalent now the parties are treating, I

7

think, not incorrectly as equivalent now of an

8

Article III proceeding.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

the bankruptcy judge?

11

MR. HACKER:

This would have to be ­­
It didn't take place before

Well, at the ­­ most of these

12

cases at the time, remember, the district court was the

13

bankruptcy court and the question was whether it's the

14

exercise of summary jurisdiction versus a plenary

15

Article III proceeding.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. HACKER:

Oh, I see the problem.
A plenary proceeding.

Now it

18

would be an adversary proceeding that would have to be

19

determined finally by the ­­ the Federal court.

20

So ­­ but I want to get to the second point,

21

because it's an important one.

22

rest on the proposition that just because the trustee is

23

a trustee, the trust assets are part of the estate,

24

which I think is completely unsupportable.

25

to say because seven years earlier, as trustee, he

Wellness doesn't just

41
Alderson Reporting Company

They go on

Official

1

treated them as ­­ the trust assets as his own;

2

therefore, we should disregard the trust.

3

That argument, I think, as I think

4

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, is functionally

5

indistinguishable from a fraudulent transfer claim

6

because they're saying, based on his alleged misuse of

7

trust assets at some point in the now distant past, we

8

should treat them as part of the estate, we should

9

disregard the trust, which is just like a fraudulent

10

transfer, which it says because of something the debtor

11

did before, transferring the assets, we should disregard

12

the transfer and treat them as part of the estate.

13

In that respect, it's ­­ it's

14

indistinguishable and it is in that respect in the same

15

way because you augment the estate.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Just to clarify the

17

record, I asked the question whether they were or

18

weren't.

19

MR. HACKER:

Fair enough.

And ­­ and I will

20

try to answer it, which is I think they are in that

21

respect indistinguishable.

22

what the ­­ all of the lower courts have said, that a

fraudulent transfer action is a Stern claim ­­

10

The suggested rule that I have for the Solicitor

11

General , which he would like the broader one, but if at

12

the time you have legal title to or in physical

13

possession of something, then it's not a Stern claim,

14

not an Article III claim because that is the

15

quintessential question that bankruptcy judges decide

16

are the things that you possess either by title or by

17

constructive holding ­­ or by holding.

18

MR. HACKER:

Right.

I think there's two

19

problems with that analysis.

20

trustee has is bare legal title as a matter of law, does

21

not have any property interest, which is what the

22

current bankruptcy code focuses on, what are the

23

debtor's interests in property and it's the ­­ the

24

trustee of a trust does not have any interest,

25

beneficial or legal interest in the assets, it's only

First is that all the

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

bare legal title.

2

So to get more interest as part of the

3

estate, you have to have some common law way to do that,

4

some claim for doing that and a classic claim is an

5

alter ego claim, if that's what you think because of

6

something the trustee did, then ­­

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But ­­ but you say that's

8

always going to be the case, that you need an

9

Article III proceeding whenever the bankruptcy trustee

10

determines that something belongs to the debtor and is

11

in the bankruptcy estate and some other private party

12

says, no, it belongs to me.

13

litigated in an Article III court?

14

MR. HACKER:

That always has to be

I don't think this Court needs

15

to decide that.

16

because the property interests from the start are

17

outside the estate.

But I do think ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Is that what you're arguing

here?
MR. HACKER:

I ­­ I ­­ I would not be

21

surprised if this Court were to hold one day that if a

22

third party has a claim to property, comes into court

23

and says, that's my ­­ that's my house, I know the

24

debtor says it is, that says it's his and the trustee

thinks it's his, that's my house, that that person is

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

because ­­ it's interesting.

you have there now with the cases.

the distinction will drive you towards that, not 100

don't think we're pushing Stern forward.

we're just applying Stern.

13

I agree with you

I do think

But I also want to address your point about

14

uniform bankruptcy code.

15

16

have accepted that bankruptcy law takes State law and

17

property rights as defined by State law as they find

18

them.

19

extent there is a State law property dispute between a

20

third party and the debtor/bankruptcy trust trustee,

21

that ­­ that doesn't change the uniformity of the

22

bankruptcy code.

23

I think the fact that this

That's all we're talking about here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

To the

And I suppose the

24

constitutional provision authorizing Congress to

25

establish a uniform law of bankruptcy does not authorize

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Congress to establish bankruptcy courts that can decide

2

questions which would normally be decided by Article III

3

courts.

4

MR. HACKER:

That's clearly right.

You

5

could establish bankruptcy law, but it's going to be an

6

Article III question, the extent to which the bankruptcy

7

courts can exercise judicial power.

8
9

As to one more point on Justice Sotomayor's
question, I had two responses.

The second one was that

10

physical possession is not a great test.

11

shows, Sharif as trustee didn't physically possess

12

anything.

13

trust assets were, so you can't think about it in terms

14

of physical possession.

15

As this case

If anybody did, it was the banks where the

16

with this question one more step.

17

administrative agencies change State law.

18

the week they change State law, even involving property.

19

And in such a case, the question is whether ­­ has this

20

administrative agency, under authority of Congress,

changed State law affecting people's property rights in

22

a way that deprives them of due process of law?

23

Every day of the week

Have

24

And so is a possible answer to your problem:

25

If the procedures of the bankruptcy court are fair when

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they litigate these questions of property right, the

2

fact that they do affect State law and take property

3

among persons switching it is not forbidden by the

4

Constitution where it indeed is authorized as part of a

5

uniform system of bankruptcy law?

6

MR. HACKER:

7

way is not sufficient.

8

answered that question in Stern.

9

that there wasn't going to be due process for the

I think due process viewed that
I think, again, this Court
There wasn't a claim

problem was that the bankruptcy court was exercising the

12

judicial power of the United States in entering a final

judgment.

Stern itself is based on a structural

By the way, is ­­ are

2

the arguments you're raising now any different as

3

applied to magistrate judges?

4

in this case, are we calling into question our ­­ our

5

acceptance of magistrate judge positions?

6

MR. HACKER:

If we rule in your favor

Well, a couple of points.

7

First of all, with respect to magistrate judges, it's

8

only with respect to final adjudications.

9

judges can still perform the functions ­­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Magistrate

So your answer is yes,

11

because you can do ­­ on express consent, you can do

12

reports and recommendations.

13

MR. HACKER:

As ­­ as to final adjudications

14

of private rights matters, magistrate judges can still

15

do something, can still litigate and resolve public

16

rights, whatever those kinds of rights and matters are.

17

But I do think it would be difficult after this case to

18

say that a magistrate can exercise judicial power of the

19

United States to enter a final judgment based solely on

20

consent.

21

Schor, effectively.

22

I think this Court answered that question in

Schor would have been an easy case, an

23

incredibly easy case, if consent alone were enough,

24

because that was an issue in Schor, and the parties

25

there did consent.

49

to know.

3

of the structural concerns involved and why there were

4

no structural concerns, such that the consent was

MR. HACKER:

were enough.

consent is enough here, because we're talking about what

Mr. Sharif made every effort to preserve the issue to

essentially; his lawyer realized what's happened.

14

He's not sandbagging.

As

1

sufficient, to apply what this Court applied in the

2

Roell case in finding implied consent, which clearly was

3

not applicable here.

4

In Roell, the Court found implied consent

5

only because, quote, "the litigant or counsel was

6

made" ­­ "was made aware of the need for consent" ­­

7

didn't happen here ­­ "and the right to refuse it" ­­

8

also didn't happen here ­­ "and still voluntarily

9

appeared to try the case."

10

Further, the Court emphasized in Roell, the

11

party later actually did consent in writing.

12

didn't happen here.

13

That also

So none of the factors that created implied

14

consent in Roell were sufficient, and for that reason we

15

think the Court should affirm the judgment below.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CATHERINE STEEGE
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MS. STEEGE:

In response to the test that

21

Justice Sotomayor proposed about possession, that, in

22

fact, under the historic cases ­­ the

23

Taubel­Scott­Kitzmiller case, that's the easy situation,

6

14

He had actual

And that, under the

That case goes the other way.

But that's

15

because the litigant was trying to bring a preference

16

action.

17

had seized some property, and the argument was he had

18

done it within what was then a four­month preference

19

period, and they were really trying to bring a

20

preference case under the constructive actual

21

possession.

22

What was happening in that case is the sheriff

That's different than the situation with a

There's also macro­control over the system,
