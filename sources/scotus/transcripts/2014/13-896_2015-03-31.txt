ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. WERBNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns whether an infringer, who

12

bypasses myriad means of adjudicating patent validity

13

and who then actively induces infringement, can escape

14

responsibility simply by claiming that they believe the

15

patent was invalid.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, not claiming, but by

proving.
MR. WERBNER:

Well, they would have to prove

that, Your Honor.

validity, especially because of that, it would be wrong

21

to allow the infringer to escape liability in those

22

instances.

23

the infringer who made the mistake.

24

That's not much of a presumption

Mr. Chief Justice, I would

presumption of validity, if ­­ if it's out of line.

15

presumption has been part of patent law for several

16

hundred years, even before the codification in 1952.

And it's more than just a procedural mechanism, it's a

message that patents are presumed valid.

19

be respected not just by judges and juries, but by the

20

public who are told that until proven otherwise, patents

The ­­ and I acknowledge that,

20

as the Court said in the Global­Tech matter, that some

21

intent is required and that was found from the words

22

"actively induce" in Section 271(b).

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, why just some intent?

24

What ­­ what good does it do to say, well, you know,

25

you're really not a bad actor, but you're, you know ­­

to me that ­­ that if you don't know that you're

3

infringing or that you're encouraging somebody to

4

infringe is ­­ is no ­­ no worse than you're not knowing

5

that the patent is valid.

6

MR. WERBNER:

It ­­ it seems

Well, under the court's Aro 2

7

case that the Court described in Global­Tech's as a

8

fixture of patent law, the Court specifically there

9

recognized that once an accused infringer received

10

actual notice of the patent and is put on notice of the

11

infringing conduct, that that ­­ that creates no defense

12

to that person.

13

And I think the policy reason for that is

14

that having actual knowledge of the patent goes a very

15

long way in ­­ in ­­ in putting the person who then goes

16

forward with knowledge of the patent different than in

17

Global­Tech, and they infringe and they were on notice,

18

they should be the ones, if I might say, who should have

19

stopped when they had that notice, Your Honor, and gone

20

to the myriad means of adjudicating patent validity.

21

Now under the America Invents Act, for

22

example, there are streamlined procedures available.

23

the wrongdoing arises when someone who has actual

24

knowledge of the patent and is on notice from the patent

25

owner of infringement, if they don't go to the

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

8

streamline procedures ­­ and they can do a declaratory

2

judgment, they can do the IPR, the inter­parties review

3

at the Patent Office ­­ then they are gambling on their

4

belief.

5

who was on notice, it's wrong if the infringer with ­­

6

with that chooses not to pursue those methods.

7

And as between the patent owner and the accused

If I could point out one other statutory

7

aspect, and I'm referring to what was ­­ what is

8

Footnote 6 on page 22 of the government's brief, there's

9

an example there of three statutes that are very

10

powerful in telling us what was meant by Congress in

11

271(b), Footnote 6 on page 22.

12

The first, when we try to discern the

13

textual meaning of 271(b), we need go no further than

14

271(e)(5), that very same section.

15

very end of that section, it talks about "the courts of

16

the United States shall have subject matter jurisdiction

17

for declaratory judgment that such patent" ­­ this is

18

the brand name patent ­­ "is invalid or not infringed."

Right?

Now, Global­Tech says that I have a good
faith defense as to non­infringement, but you're

10

suggesting I don't have that good faith defense as to

invalidity.

12

that would make sense in the context that I'm talking

13

about, which I think is a pretty typical context.

14

it would seem that the two defenses are so intertwined

15

and so two sides of the same coin that they should be

16

treated in the same way.

17

MR. WERBNER:

18

understand the question.

19

the court below said in dissent they're not two sides of

20

the same coin, they're actually two separate coins.

21

I ­­ I see the ­­ the ­­ where the issue arises in claim

22

construction, but every party to a patent litigation is

If the person makes a judgment, as they have

Why do you do it for the one and not for the

That's ­­ that's what I don't understand.

MR. WERBNER:

Well, Your Honor, I would say

4

that with respect to beliefs and invalidity, it's deeply

5

ingrained in American law that there is a difference.

6

And ­­ for example, in the Cheek v. United States case,

7

that distinction was made very clear, that's in the

8

context of a criminal statute where the accused for tax

evasion, raising all sorts of mistakes of law and the

10

like, this Court held in that Cheek decision that one

11

accused of violating the prohibition will not be heard

12

to say they thought the prohibition was invalid or

13

unconstitutional.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that really does get

15

back to the Chief Justice's opening question, because

16

you're quite right in your reply brief when you say that

to that.

20

criminal law, you may need wrongful intent when you're an

the principal offense is illegal.

need to know that you're selling them a gun and that

24

person who is inducing that conduct

25

But to go back to Justice Ginsburg's point

Alderson Reporting Company

So

Official

22
1

about why would it make sense to treat the two issues

2

differently, I think there are three reasons that ­­

3

that you would do so.

4

as ­­ as Justice Kagan said, claim construction can be a

5

common subsidiary issue in both non­infringement

6

questions and invalidity issues, I don't think it's

7

anomalous to still treat the two issues as separate.

8
9

The first is that even though,

For instance, in Chief v. United States, the
Court ­­ it ­­ it's clear that in ­­ in the statutory

10

context, you might have a question about statutory

11

construction that would be relevant to whether you're

12

violating the statute, and that same question might be

13

relevant to the validity of the statute, but the Court

14

still said that your belief that you ­­ that ­­ that the

15

statute was invalid did not negate your stand with

16

respect to whether you're violating the law.

17

And as to ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said on a ­­ a

19

couple of times about the idea of ­­ of difficulty of

20

going after all the little people.

21

would seem to me that once you have a few successful

22

suits against the users rather than inducers, both the

23

users and the inducer will get the message and not ­­

24

not continue on with the infringement.

25

MS. ANDERS:

But why is that?

It

Well, I'm not sure that that's

Alderson Reporting Company

23

­­ that's always going to be the case as a practical

2

matter.

3

you know, the ­­ the users may have ­­ the direct users

5

provides, in the context of surgical materials, that

6

doctors can't be directly liable for infringement, so

7

the only ­­ the only course there is to go after the

8

inducer.

9

I think there may be situations in ­­ in which,

For instance, the Patent Act

So I think that Congress anticipated in the

10

Patent Act that inducement would be an independent means

11

of imposing liability.

12

But to go back to the ­­ the two reasons

13

that it may make sense as a policy matter to treat

14

invalidity and non­infringement differently, I think one

15

of them is that invalidity questions can be even harder

16

and more complex to determine.

17

to keep in mind here that ­­ that what we're saying is

that the defendant would have a ­­ he would be able to

I think as a ­­ I think

our ­­ our primary point is that it's not usually the

case in the law that we require defendants to have

complex legal questions, technical factual questions,

22

way it works in the law.

That is not usually the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What you just said

does sound like an argument that Global­Tech was ­­ was

5

MS. ANDERS:

Again, I don't think it is,

6

Your Honor, because, again, even if you understand

7

Global­Tech to require knowledge of infringement, we

8

think there are reasons to treat infringement

9

differently.

10

And I go back to the statute here.

If you

11

assume that 271(b) requires knowledge with respect to

12

the fact that the acts constitute infringement,

13

infringement is defined in 271(a).

14

defined as practicing the elements of the patent without

authorization.

16

17

possible to establish infringement without establishing

the validity of the patent.

As this Court explained in Grokster and in

4

Global­Tech, the linchpin of scienter for inducement

5

liability is knowledge that the induced acts, quote,

6

"violate the rights of the patentee."

7

practicing an invalid patent violates no such right of a

8

patentee, an accused inducer who reasonably believes in

good faith that a patent is void lacks the scienter

required for liability under Section 271(b).

prove it's invalid, your position basically says, no, I

18

don't have to prove it, I just have to show I had a good

19

faith basis.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, no, no, no.

I mean, in

21

order to invalidate a patent in court, the party urging

22

that the patent is invalid bears the burden of proving

23

invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.

24

actually not the burden if you challenge it before the

25

PTO.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Official

28
1

But it is a high burden, and it's

2

appropriately high because once a patent is declared

3

invalid, it is unenforceable against anybody for all

4

time and under principles of ­­ under the Blonder­Tongue

5

principles, a patentee who loses once is gone.

6

there ­­ this case, of course, and the issue in this

7

case only arises, as all specific intent cases arise,

8

only where there is otherwise established a cause of

9

action.

And

10

So, in other words, the good faith belief

11

either that the patent wasn't being infringed by the

12

direct infringers or was a void patent will arise only

13

when a court or the PTO has concluded that the patent is

14

indeed valid.

case is will it ­­ that it is the ­­ the plaintiff's

16

duty, the plaintiff's burden to prove scienter.

17

19

identifying the patent and expressing my belief that the

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I ­­ I want to get to my

16

last point about what the jury will be instructed, but

17

let me first, with all due respect, take on that

18

assertion.

19

When Congress enacted Section 271(b) and

20

Section 271(c) in 1952, both the House report and the

21

Senate report said two things about those provisions:

22

Number one, that they were enacted to reflect common law

23

principles of aiding and abetting liability, and that

24

they were thus, quote, "an expression of law and

25

morals."

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

30
1

And this Court in Global­Tech precisely

2

recognized that these provisions are, in fact, the

3

modern day statutory version of civil aiding and

4

abetting.

5

And aiding and abetting at common law absolutely require

6

knowledge of wrongdoing.

7

The Federal Circuit has always recognized it.

And just to get to your original question,

8

in a case in which the jury has found that the patent is

9

valid and the plaintiff goes on to say, you know, and

10

there was appropriate scienter because ­­ and it's quite

11

unlike this case because there was no letter ­­ a letter

12

was sent saying, I have this, the '395 patent, and

13

here's why you infringe it, you've heard the defendant

14

explain why he or she or it nonetheless had a reasonable

15

good faith belief that the patent was void.

16

In ­­ in evaluating the reasonableness and

17

good faith of that expressed belief, you need to take

18

into account that under the patent laws, patents ­­

19

issued patents are presumed valid and that in order

20

to ­­ in order to establish the invalidity of a patent

21

in court, as I have otherwise instructed you, the

22

defendant has to prove invalidity by clear and

convincing evidence, and that's what you should take

24

into account when you are evaluating the defendant's

25

profession of a good faith belief.

business method patents, Nautilus as to indefiniteness,

Where the common law put it under aiding and abetting

assertion that invalid claims can't be infringed is a

nonsense statement.

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.

First of all, Charles

in Richdel, which was, which was decided in 1983 at the

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought ­­ and maybe

8

correct me if I'm wrong ­­ that what this meant was

9

thinking of how it comes up in litigation.

So you're in

10

the district court, and you have ­­ let's say you're the

11

alleged infringer or contributory infringer or inducer,

12

so you say, number one, the patent is invalid; and,

13

number two, if it's valid, it was not infringed.

14

So in the court of first instance, both of

15

those issues are discrete in the sense that I am arguing

16

it's not valid, so no patent is out of it; but if I'm

17

wrong about that, it wasn't infringed.

18

those are discrete inquiries.

of the ­­ a ­­ a finding of infringement, the ability
