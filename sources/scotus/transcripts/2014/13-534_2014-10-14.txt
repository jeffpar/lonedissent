ORAL ARGUMENT OF HASHIM M. MOOPPAN

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. MOOPPAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
A State regulatory agency does not lose its

12

State action antitrust immunity simply because the

13

agency is run by part­time public officials who are also

14

market participants in their personal capacities.

15

The FTC's contrary position that the

16

agency's officials must be disinterested cannot be

17

reconciled with this Court's jurisprudence for three

18

reasons:

19

deference to a State's sovereign choices concerning how

20

to structure and manage its own regulatory agencies.

21

Second, the regulatory conduct of public officials who

22

are also market participants cannot properly be equated

23

with the conduct of private businesspeople.

24

the FTC's position would be massively and needlessly

25

disrupted.

First, respect for federalism requires

3
Alderson Reporting Company

And third,

Official

1

States obtain valuable benefits from using

2

market participants as part­time public officials.

3

gain the benefits of their expertise and they gain the

4

benefits of not having to have a full­time bureaucracy

5

with a full salary.

Ultimately whether this board

11

should be entitled to State action immunity is a

question of Federal law.

13

board as public or private, we submit that absent

14

extraordinary circumstances, the Federal court should

15

treat a State's designation of a State entity as public,

16

and that when that entity is charged with public duties

17

as a State entity.

18

But in characterizing the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if you agree that a

19

State can't simply deem something that for all other

20

purposes is private to be a State entity or

21

instrumentality, there has to be some test.

22

23

MR. MOOPPAN:

MR. MOOPPAN:

this board didn't have authority to issue these letters.

15

It is true that the board doesn't have authority to

16

issue self­executing orders akin to an injunction, but

17

it is also true that the board has authority to send

18

letters to prospective non­dentists saying that if you

19

don't cease and desist your conduct, we will sue you.

20

The only question in this case in terms of

First, it's not quite right to say that

21

State law authority is whether the wording of these

22

letters was somehow problematic.

23

5

was has the State asked the organization to enforce

6

State law and given ­­ entrusted them with that

7

responsibility.

8

So suppose a State just looked around and

16

were subject to the traditional duties that a public

17

entity has, if they had to comply with the

19

MR. MOOPPAN:

Honor.

association and said:

sometimes you will act as a private trade association

What you're

Well, my goodness, there's

5

a lot of cases.

well­established that if, in fact, the State says to a

truckers, you go set your own trucking prices but be

Because what we have here is we have a group of dentists

like the group of wine merchants, like the group of

that the risk that we're worried about is that the State

2

is circumventing the Federal antitrust laws.

3

The concern was not that the officials were

going to act contrary to the State's interest.

5

concern was that the State was just authorizing them to

6

violate Federal law.

But if there's any ambiguity about where ­­

what Hallie says on this it's resolved by Omni, because

12

if ever there were a case where the State's officials

13

had the self­interest, where they might have been acting

14

contrary to the State's own interest, it's when the

15

State's officials are being bribed by private parties.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Mooppan, could we ­­ you

17

have to explain that understanding of Hallie to me.

18

Hallie is a very important case because it essentially

19

asks the question that's right here, which is we have

20

this odd entity and we have to decide whether that

21

entity is more like just private parties or is more like

22

a prototypical State actor.

23

like a prototypical State actor.

25

And

And there we say it's more

We say the

requirement of active State supervision is a way of

14
Alderson Reporting Company

ensuring that the actor is engaging in the challenged

2

conduct pursuant to State policy.

that test, we need to have that test when there's a real

4

danger that the party is acting to further his own

5

interest but not when there is not such a danger.

6

And we need to have

And here that suggests that the question is:

7

Is this party, this board of all dentists, is there a

8

danger that it's acting to further its own interests

9

rather than the governmental interests of the State?

10
11

And that seems almost self­evidently to be true.
MR. MOOPPAN:

With all due respect, Your

12

Honor, I think you've skipped a sentence in Hallie.

13

between the first sentence and the second sentence you

14

read me there is a sentence that says the rest ­­ the

15

purpose of the active supervision requirement is to

16

prevent the State from circumventing the Sherman Act.

17

The danger that the Court was talking about in the

18

sentence you read is the danger that the State is just

19

authorizing private people to violate Federal law rather

20

than having its own State policy.

21

In

22

15

Now, the question of exclusion of an

requiring by law that regulatory boards be staffed by

11

members of the profession, that there appears to be no

whom to decide whom to appoint and the governor chose to

14

appoint only practitioners.

in this case ­­

17

is critical in your opinion, that there is a State

because he wants the dentists' vote and the dentists are

JUSTICE ALITO:

If you are not prepared to

give that up, then I really don't understand the

contours of your rule.

5

I really am not attracted to the idea of Federal courts

6

looking at State agencies, State regulatory entities, to

7

determine whether they are really serving the public

8

interest or they are serving some private interest.

We're certainly not advocating

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Stewart, the problem

with your answer, at least for me, is that you're being

5

in this case, but to guide the decision­making for

6

future courts.

7

it the way Judge Keenan did, and say it was an elected

I mean, just to say this board we can do

We can say
So what do

How do we articulate your ruling?

MR. STEWART:

I mean, the way I read both

Judge Keenan's concurrence and the majority opinion is

14

selected by other practicing dentists, there is no State

15

action immunity.

whether the outcome would be different if the members

were selected by the government.

We leave for another day the question

looks at the trajectory we're taking.

21

colleagues have expressed the concern that the

trajectory will involve us in case after case trying to

decide how far too far is.

MR. STEWART:

It walks that line and it goes and
And some of my

And frankly, if the Court

wanted to say, as part of its opinion, as long as they

1

are actually required by law to be practicing dentists,

2

there's no State action immunity, but if the law doesn't

require that and it happens to be the pattern of

gubernatorial appointment, if the Court says that ­­ the

5

outcome would, in fact, be different in that case, we

6

would prefer that to a decision that says we're going to

I guess the ­­ the two

the Court also does proceed incrementally and it doesn't

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You have very long

15

there's an immense difference between establishing

the ­­ the standards for a profession and excluding an

17

individual from the profession.

what is a more obvious restriction of competition than

25

I don't see that

My goodness.

What ­­

I ­­ I don't see

Well, it's one thing to say

It seems to me they both involve

MR. STEWART:

I ­­

They ­­ they involve

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

anticompetitive decisions and they involve ­­ they

2

require the State to tap into expertise.

3

basic decision to prohibit unlicensed individuals from

4

removing stains or accretions from teeth was made by the

5

North Carolina legislature back many decades ago.

6

Obviously, the North Carolina legislature is not an

7

expert body, it's not composed of dentists, but

8

presumably they got input from the dental profession and

9

they ­­ they tapped into the relative expertise for

10

That is, the

purposes of making their decision.

11

The determination, once the statutory

12

structure has been established, the determination

13

whether teeth whitening falls within one of the

14

enumerated categories is not really establishing the

15

standards.

16

And that does require some interstitial discretionary

17

decision­making.

18

was alluding to earlier, is we want those interstitial

19

decisions to be made by disinterested persons or at

20

least, if they're not made by disinterested persons, we

21

don't feel confident that they truly reflect the policy

22

choices of the State legislature itself.

23

It is interpreting the existing standards.

And our point, as ­­ as Justice Kagan

What would happen if the

24

If the North Carolina ­­ I

8

that went beyond the basic prohibition.

9

all intents and purposes, just as if the North Carolina

There could still be potential arguments that the

But ­­ but for

legislature had specified that non­dentists cannot

11

lawfully perform teeth whitening, that policy choice

12

would not be subject to second­guessing by the FTC or a

13

Federal antitrust court.

14

Similarly, if the North Carolina Supreme

15

Court said, we construe the existing statute to have

16

that meaning, that determination also wouldn't be

17

subject to review by an antitrust court.

before the commission offered reasons to believe that

19

seem that an interpretation of this statute to cover

20

whitening would be completely out of the question.

21

MR. STEWART:

We agree.

So it doesn't

And as I say, the

commission specifically declined to announce a decision

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought they agreed to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If the consequences of a

16

decision in your favor were that no professionals or

17

representative of any occupation would ever serve on a

18

government board where there's any chance of antitrust

19

liability, would that, in your view, advance the

20

purposes of the antitrust laws?

21

MR. STEWART:

I mean, if we thought that

22

were the consequence of the Court's decision, then we

23

would be very leery of urging this result.

24

in cases like Goldfarb that the Virginia bar, for

25

instance, was held to be susceptible to suit under the

50
Alderson Reporting Company

But we see

antitrust laws and could not invoke the State action

immunity because it was out ahead of the Virginia

3

Supreme Court, and that hasn't had the effect of

4

inducing members of the bar en masse to refrain from bar

5

association activities.

6

Just to finish my answer to Justice

7

Ginsburg, even if the statute is phrased at a relatively

8

high level of generality that leaves some interstitial

9

questions unresolved, it can still satisfy clear

10

articulation.

11

bureaucrats who said we interpret the phrase "removal of

12

stains and accretions" to include teeth whitening, we'd

13

have clear articulation in the statute even though it

14

didn't resolve every question.

15

determination made by a body that would not require

active supervision and that would be good enough.

would satisfy the prerequisites to State action immunity

24

like people who are designated State officials

25

generally, will take an oath to support the

The first is that there was a fair

The oath is at North Carolina General Statute

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4

It's essentially a State law version of the

5

oath that new members of this Court's bar take in ­­

take when they're sworn, as was done this morning.

But when private counsel take that oath, no

13

one imagines that they lose their private character, and

14

in particular, nobody construes that oath as a promise

15

by private counsel that he will place the interests of

16

17

clients.

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's because what they're

21

promising to do is to serve as faithful private counsel.

22

If they were being sworn in to an agency and promise to

23

execute their duties in accordance with law, it would be

24

quite different.

25

MR. STEWART:

And that's what's happening here.
There's nothing in the oath

52
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

that requires them to place the interests of the public

2

on a par with the interests of the dental community.

3

And everything about their selection ­­ the fact that

4

they are required to be dentists, the fact that they are

5

selected by other dentists ­­ reinforces the sense that

6

they are expected to treat the dental community as their

7

constituency.

Breyer's question.

I'd like to begin with Justice
The ultimate question in this case

53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

is how to balance a cost­benefit question.

2

There are benefits from having experts, and

3

there are risks from having experts be regulators, and

4

the question is who should make the decision of how to

5

weigh those costs and balance those risks.

6

government is arguing is that the Federal antitrust laws

7

second­guess the State's decision about how to balance

8

that risk.

9

And what the

The States have decided that the better way

10

to handle the situation where you have experts like

11

neurologists is to have some level of supervision, but

12

not the level of active supervision that is required for

13

private parties.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why not simply say that the

15

supervisor, be it the Court or be it the commission,

16

must, when it decides the lawfulness of the agency's

17

action or the private board's action, take into account

18

the risks of self­dealing as well as the State policy

19

that favors them making this decision, and where the

20

consequence is an unreasonable weighing, it is unlawful

21

under State law.

22

Now, that way you bring in an anti­trust

23

element, it would comport with Midcal, you would be

24

guarding against self­dealing without interfering

One standard

10

of active supervision that applies to private parties

11

and one standard of active supervision that applies to

12

public officials who also have private interests.

13

That's the reason why Mr. Stewart wouldn't

14

answer your question by saying any of those things would

15

work because they will never say that that stuff works

16

for purely private parties.

MR. MOOPPAN:

They will never say that

Excuse me.

I'm sorry.

I was just going to say they

20

would never say that the mere ability to have some level

21

of review is good enough for private parties because

22

even they recognize there is a fundamental difference

23

between a private party and a public official who also

24

has private interests.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Mooppan, the active

supervision requirement has been around a long time and

2

it varies case by case and state by state.

3

wide, wide, wide variety of mechanisms that might

4

satisfy the active supervision prong in a particular

5

state with respect to a particular kind of activity.

6

But what you are suggesting is that that

There are a

7

prong be simply removed from the analysis, that it be

8

utterly irrelevant, that there is no supervision at all,

9

and that's a very different and much more dramatic

10
11

thing.
MR. MOOPPAN:

Well, what I'm suggesting is

12

twofold.

13

rigorous standard and I am sure the FTC would have told

14

you that if you had asked them that question precisely.

15

And I'm saying that it ­­ the issue here isn't whether

16

these people will be unsupervised.

17

will determine what level of supervision.

18

question is whether the state should decide that a lower

19

level of supervision is the appropriate one, balancing

20

expertise versus the risk of conflicts of interests.

21

And especially when you're dealing with supervision of

22

market participants.

23

require too much supervision as a condition of

24

anti­trust immunity, no one will serve on these boards.

25

First, the act of supervision is a fairly

advocating this position if we would have a high

3

the ADA and the AMA and from 23 states, all of whom

4

express grave concern that if you require supervision

5

market participants will not serve on these boards, and

6

that is the sort of concern this Court has recognized in

7

cases like Hoover v. Romlin.

8
9

Well, there is an amicus brief from

It is fundamentally up to the state to
determine how to bear this risk.

Whether they want to

10

say that the benefits of expertise outweigh the risks of

11

conflicts of interest.

12

cases like Omni, that the Sherman Act is not intended to

13

serve as some general rule of good government.

14

to the state to determine how they want to regulate as

15

sovereigns.

16

That is what this Court held in

It is up

The final point I would like to make is

17

about Justice Alito's question about what would happen

18

if the State Supreme Court tomorrow said that teeth

19

whitening was the practice of dentistry.

20

sure I understood Mr. Stewart's position but the holding

21

below is that active supervision is required regardless

22

of whether there is clear articulation, so I would think

23

that there would be liability regardless of what

24

the Court did in the future.
