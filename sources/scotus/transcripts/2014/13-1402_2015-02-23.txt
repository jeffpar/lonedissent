It is firmly established that as an

7

8

her spouse out.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

She obviously has an

10

interest, but ­­ but she is affected only indirectly by

11

the denial of the visa to her husband.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

in fact, the Court made exactly that point in the

O'Bannon case that we cite in our briefs.

14

O'Bannon arose in a different context, but the Court, in

17

Thank you,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. HADDAD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There was substantial discussion of the

18

doctrine of consular non­reviewability thus far, but one

19

point that did not emerge is that this Court has never

20

articulated the doctrine in the way the government has

21

presented it today.

22

decisions of a group, a large group of officials of the

23

Executive Branch are somehow immune from judicial review

24

in every instance because they are the decisions of

25

certain officials, consular officers in this case.

This Court has never said that the

agency discretion by law.

7

commits this stuff to the discretion of the consular

8

officials and the State Department.

9

MR. HADDAD:

It ­­ it has a

And I think what the

10

the government where it needs to go in this case,

11

Justice Scalia, because ours is a constitutional claim.

12

It's not raised under the APA.

13

in the discussion, as Justice Kagan pointed out, unlike

14

the situation in Mandel, where all the Attorney General

15

was doing was implementing a statute that gave him,

16

quote/unquote, "discretion" to weigh the denial of a

17

visa, here we have an extensive statutory set of

18

exclusions, and the government has acknowledged in its

19

reply brief that it does not view its consular officers

20

as having discretion in how they apply and implement the

21

specific terms that Congress has set forward.

22

And as came out earlier

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But to get to your

23

constitutional claim, explain to me the difference

24

between the marital basis in this case and, say, a

25

parental basis.

I mean, if the individual here was a

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

child, would the parent in the United States have the

2

same rights as the spouse?

3

MR. HADDAD:

If the U.S. citizen parent were

4

trying to get an immigration visa for his or her son or

5

daughter, yes, in our understanding of the liberty

6

interest that this Court has ­­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

spouses.

9

well, right?

It's parents.

Okay.

So it's

I suppose it's children as

If the parent is ­­ is the one who's being

10

denied access, a child in the United States to be able

11

MR. HADDAD:

Certainly a minor child, Your

13

Honor, yes.

14

that we cite, the Meyer case, the Pierce case, Griswold,

15

the cases the Court is very familiar with, those cases

16

involve the right to marriage and to raise a family.

17
18
19

If the Court looks to the grounding cases

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Brother ­­ a brother

and sister?
MR. HADDAD:

Brother and sister is ­­ I

20

think the Court would look at, in all likelihood, for

21

the constitutional right, would look at whether the

22

brother and sister were part of a family unit that would

23

be living together.

24

that the Court looks at.

25

That seems to be an important value

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about someone who

27
Alderson Reporting Company

1

wanted to marry the immigrant?

2

you're depriving me of marital bliss.

3

this person, and I can't do it.

I want to marry

Would that be enough?

I ­­ I don't know that that

would be enough, Your Honor.

respondent has a valid marriage and there's no question

at all about the validity of the marriage, we are in the

That's correct as a matter of

11

that her right arises from the statute and from the

12

rights conferred by statute.

13

rights arise as a constitutional matter from her

14

marriage.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But our claim is not

Our argument is that her

So we have ­­ so she

16

has ­­ she has marriage, and you rely on that the right

17

to marry includes the right to live with one's spouse.

18

What do you do with Turner against Safley?

19

held that the prisoner had a right to marry, but

20

certainly not a right to live with his spouse.

21

MR. HADDAD:

The Court

We believe we're right on point

22

and consistent with Turner, because as we describe the

23

right, it's not the right of entry, of having her

24

husband admitted, any more than a petitioner in Turner's

25

circumstance could say, I have a right to have my

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

husband released from prison.
All we're saying is, there's a liberty

to live with your spouse through the erroneous

decision.

MR. HADDAD:

Well, let me try to address it,

19

then, Justice Kennedy, so that I don't skip that step.

20

As we've laid out in our brief, there is a right that we

21

believe is inherent in the right to marry and to raise a

22

family, which this Court has recognized.

23

that right, for that right to have meaning, it

24

presupposes that the husband and wife can live together.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It would be

30

May I ask you how this would

apparently believed that requiring the government to

They

7

MR. HADDAD:

Well, I think, as your

questions to my colleague illustrated earlier, Justice

Kagan, all they have done is cite authority that

10

Congress has given them to adjudicate and decide

11

eligibility for a visa.

12

statute applies to this particular applicant, and it

13

can't be a facially legitimate application of the

14

statute unless you know why it's being applied.

15

They have not said why the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, gosh, I would have

16

thought that it can't be a legitimate application of the

17

statute unless you knew why it was being applied; but

18

the facially legitimate actually is a lesser standard

19

than that.

20

its face, it's legitimate because they are acting under

21

the authority that the law gives them, according to

22

them.

23

It's just like, you know, on its face.

MR. HADDAD:

On

Well, here's an example,

24

Justice Kagan.

25

13a of the government's opening brief where the statute

If the Court looks, for example, at page

38
Alderson Reporting Company

2

will see that Congress wrote in to the eligibility

3

criteria in certain circumstances an opportunity for the

4

applicant, having received notice of the reason, to

5

rebut with clear and convincing evidence the stated

6

reason for the exclusion.

7

On its face, we have no idea whether that or

8

one of the other provisions that allows a rebuttal was

9

the one invoked here.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the

11

statute includes a provision that notice of the reason

12

need not be given in the case of a national security.

MR. HADDAD:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

That

was the status of the statute before Congress added

these provisions that allow for a rebuttal.

view, it makes ­­ it would make the statute nonsensical

17

24
25

MR. HADDAD:

The reason, Justice Kennedy, is

that in the situation that we have here, and certainly

44
Alderson Reporting Company

1

as it's put to the Court, the respondent is a United

2

States citizen and she knows of no reason why her

3

husband does not satisfy the eligibility requirements

4

5

there is no process around the initial threshold

So

7

JUSTICE KAGAN: Mr. Haddad, I would have thought

8

that all these kind of parade of horribles could have been

9

played out from the Mandel case as well, that you would

10

have thought, oh, my gosh, we're giving all these

11

professors a chance to complain about people going to

12

prison because the professors want to be able to talk to

13

them.

14

I'm wondering, why do you think that is?

15

difference between the two situations such that we need

16

to worry about the parade of horribles in one but not in

17

the other?

18

And none of that, of course, ever happened.

MR. HADDAD:

And

Is there any

I don't think there's any

19

reason to worry about it, because the standard that

20

Mandel set is very, very deferential and generous to the

21

government.

incentive for a lawsuit is where the plaintiffs are

Don't you think that's possible?

JUSTICE KAGAN: No but law professors they’re

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I think ­­ I think what

6

you're saying, though I'm not certain, is simply ­­

7

you're not saying that the wife should be able to sue to

8

get her husband out of prison, et cetera, but she does

9

have a constitutionally protected interest.

But to say

10

a person has an interest is not to say how that

11

protection goes.

12

If you say we have all the examples of what

13

would happen, if you say there is an interest and none

14

of them need happen, now try it the other way.

And I think in terms of the concern about how far this

21

would point the Court to 8 U.S.C. 1201(i) and 6 U.S.C.

22

236(f), both of which say ­­ indicate the consular

23

officer decisions are not to be reviewed by anybody.
