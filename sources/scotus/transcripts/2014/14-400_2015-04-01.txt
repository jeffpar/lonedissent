It leaves up in the air

but what it does say is ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MADDEN:

In bad faith, under Section

14

case to Chapter 7 in bad faith, all of the post­petition

15

property remains property of the estate.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Effectively ­­

But ­­ but ­­ and it seems

17

to me that that is a statutory argument that cuts

18

against your position, because the Code makes this ­­

19

makes this distinction.

MR. MADDEN:

Well, no.

disagree, Your Honor.

23

has decided that it's only when ­­ when a debtor

24

25

remain property of the estate available to creditors in

I think the Code cuts in our

the case.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What does that mean?

3

That ­­ Chapter 13 is over, Chapter 7 is underway.

4

Remains in a nonexistent estate ­­ I mean, there's no

5

more Chapter 13.

6

It goes to the creditors, right?

MR. MADDEN:

Not quite, Your Honor.

It

7

remains in the estate because a new Chapter 7 trustee

8

takes over as the representative of the estate under the

9

Code.

And so it becomes the Chapter 7 trustee's

10

responsibility to administer that estate and make

11

disbursements to creditors according to the Code.

12

Now, here ­­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Incidentally, I must say

14

you are correct, I think this does cut in ­­ in your

15

favor, the idea that a ­­ a bad­faith conversion means

16

that the estate is ­­ is the current one, the current

17

estate.

I think that Code

MR. MADDEN:

Congress intended when they enacted Section 348 ­­

If you treat it like a, say, a normal trustee, a normal

MR. MADDEN:

Well, Section 348(f) intends

6

essentially two elements to determine whether property

is going to remain in the estate.

in a good­faith conversion, it has to be property that

9

existed as of the date of the petition, and it still has

10

to exist in the estate.

So is this a revocable

or irrevocable trust?

If you can convert, you're

MR. MADDEN:

I ­­ I think if any analogy

19

from the common law applies, Justice Sotomayor, it would

20

be that of a revocable trust, because Congress has been

21

very clear in Section 1307(a) that a debtor has the

22

right to convert his case out of Chapter 13 and into

23

Chapter 7 at any time.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if it's a revocable

trust, what's the trust law in that situation?

Alderson Reporting Company

MR. MADDEN:

A settler in a revocable trust

obtains the corpus of the trust upon revocation.

effectively what Congress has said here, because when a

case leaves Chapter 13 and enters Chapter 7, it's

case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, the court docket

reflected that Respondent's service had terminated and

So in this case, when Petitioner converted his

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would your problem,

19

the issue, be moot in 99 percent of the cases if the

20

trustee decided to adopt a procedure which will provide

21

for a distribution at the end of every day?

22

MR. MADDEN:

If a trustee has already

23

distributed the money to creditors lawfully under a

24

plan, then, yes, that property has left the estate.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

So it would only be

Official

11
1

the rare situation when this ­­ even rarer than now,

2

when this arises, and presumably trustees who wish to

3

distribute to creditors can adopt the sort of rule that

4

they desire.

5

MR. MADDEN:

Yes, but because trustees are

6

fiduciaries of the estate and represent the estate,

7

they're not allowed to dissipate estate assets by making

8

frequent or even constant distributions.

9

it's because they're the representative of the estate ­­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it's ­­

Well, I suppose if

11

there's a particularly difficult ­­ and maybe this is

12

such a case ­­ where the trustee has to take some time

13

to figure it out, perhaps.

14

where the wages arrive on a Wednesday or whatever, it

15

doesn't seem to me that this would raise serious

16

concerns.

But in a fortuitous case

17

And the consequence of that is it becomes

18

even more fortuitous when the assets come within the

19

control of the trustee, so that a rule that says there's

20

a huge difference based on the fortuity of the timing

21

might not make much sense.

22

MR. MADDEN:

Well, I think that's the rule,

23

respectfully, that Congress adopted when they allowed

24

debtors to make the conversion at any time.

25

didn't require a debtor to give notice, and Congress

Alderson Reporting Company

Congress

Official

12

didn't make conversion effective only after

disbursements.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What about the parties?

4

Can they ­­ can they handle the situation by providing

5

in the ­­ in the Chapter 13 agreement that any funds

6

remaining, if there should be a conversion, will be

7

distributed among the creditors?

8
9

MR. MADDEN:

Well, what they can't do is

undermine the effects of conversion, because under

10

Section 1307 of the Code, the debtor's right to convert

11

the case at any time is not ­­

12

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So your answer is no, the

parties could not ­­ could not do that.
MR. MADDEN:

That's right, the answer is no

15

in that the parties can't undermine the effective

16

conversion.

So what happened here is the Petitioner was supposed to

circumstances, debtor found himself unable to make those

The statute doesn't say what will happen to this

We're dealing with an absolute

helps your case because I am much more willing to buy

onto a random rule of law that the parties can contract

The Third Circuit in deciding

position might be an out the parties could take.

4

think there would just ­­ there would be two constraints

5

on that issue in another case that isn't presented here.

6

One is that a plan can only provide what The Code allows

7

the plan to provide.

8

9

The Code provides that a debtor could vest property of

property in specific entities.

in the Code that allows a debtor to vest property

4

that the statute doesn't say much of anything about

So he's kind of asking for the quid without the

13

So what's your response to that?

14

MR. MADDEN:

I think there are a number of

15

problems with viewing Chapter 13 through that lens.

16

Chapter 13 is better for debtors and creditors alike,

17

that everyone comes out ahead because no creditor can

18

receive less under a Chapter 13 plan than they would be

19

entitled to receive under a Chapter 7 liquidation.

20

Congress ­­ and generally, the policy of the Bankruptcy

21

Code is intended to encourage debtors into Chapter 13

22

because it's better for everyone.

23

debtor sort of rents the benefits of Chapter 13 from his

creditors who stands to gain from him doing so doesn't

25

make a whole lot of sense under the way the Bankruptcy

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about ­­ I

3

gather there can be payments directly to the creditors.

4

What ­­ those, I assume, they get those without having

5

to worry about this problem?

6

MR. MADDEN:

That's correct.

Under Chapter

7

13, either the debtor or the trustee can be the

8

disbursing agent under the plan, but in either case,

9

it's when the money is disbursed by the disbursing agent

10
11

that the rights shift to the creditors.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

But in the case

12

of the creditor who is paid directly, that's ­­ there's

13

sort of no middleman, right?

14

MR. MADDEN:

That's right.

But the question

15

is whether the ­­ when they've been paid, the property

leaves the estate and becomes property of the creditors.

17

Now ­­

the ­­ the ending of the trustee's service, the

2

time.

5

claims against the estate in the Chapter 13 case

6

automatically became claims against the estate in the

7

Chapter 7 case.

8
9

Once the case had been converted, all of the

And so what happened here is you had a
Chapter 13 trustee still acting on and paying claims as

10

though Chapter 13 was still going.

11

Chapter 7 trustee had taken over the reins of being the

12

representative of the estate and dealing with claims.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

All the while, a

But the ­­ the money that's

14

in the hands of the trustee at the moment that the

15

Chapter 7 petition is filed will probably be wages that,

16

under the 13 plan, were to be distributed to creditors.

17

And the trustee has to make out a check to somebody.

18

So the only question is:

Is the name of the

19

trustee X, which is the creditor to which it has gone,

20

or is the name Y, which is the debtor or the equivalent?

21

So I don't see how we get very far saying

22

that the trustee's services have ended at that point.

23

No one thinks the trustee would keep the money.

again, six of one, half a dozen of the other.

25

MR. MADDEN:

But I think there's a

Alderson Reporting Company

And,

case in which the language of the Code is entirely ­­

there are clear indications from the text of the Code

that do help answer the question, and are consistent

20

with the common law backdrop.

21

Section 1328(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, it says, the

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about ­­ back to the

MR. GOLDBLATT:
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
Now, the standard trust

law, CJS, when the grantor exercises a power of

12

revocation, the interest of the beneficiary ceases, and

13

the assignee of the grant or namely the grantor, takes

14

the corpus of the trust free from the trust.

15

you are saying is, if I look further into that, I will

discover that if the grantor revoked the trust on

February 1, and if under the trust documents, a $100 is

due to a beneficiary on January 1, and on March 1,

trustee by reference to the common law of trust.

Congress did, after all, use the term trustee, which is

JUSTICE SCALIA:

There are cases, a

Mr. Goldblatt, what do you

10

do about the argument that what you're asking to be done

11

cannot be done, because immediately upon the conversion,

12

the Chapter 13 Trustee no longer has any powers?

13

MR. GOLDBLATT:

So, Justice Scalia, that ­­

14

that argument from Section 348(e) of the Bankruptcy Code

15

simply proves too much, as was suggested earlier.

trustee clearly has to distribute the money to someone.

Property of the

5

MR. GOLDBLATT:

So if ­­ the language of

6

348(f) does the following:

It says that the ­­ the

7

property of the Chapter 7 estate is the property that ­­

8

the question that Congress had when it dealt with 348(f)

9

is the debtor files a Chapter 13 case on day one, lives

10

in Chapter 13 for some period of time, and then

11

converts.

12

So the question is:

Okay, what universe of

13

property is in the Chapter 7 estate?

14

property the debtor had at the beginning of the case or

15

is it the property the debtor had on the day of

16

conversion?

disagreement in the courts on that question until 1994.

Is it all the

That was a fair question and there was

18

Congress answered that question by saying,

19

the property of the 13 estate is the property that the

20

debtor had on the petition date, the original petition

21

date, that they still have as of the date of conversion.

22

And the reason that makes sense is for the

23

reason Justice Breyer identified.

24

someone who came into some sort of windfall during that

25

period of time would essentially have to turn that all

Alderson Reporting Company

Because otherwise,

42

over to creditors instead of keeping it.

2

the ­­ or actually, even ­­ even more directly and the

3

Third Circuit talks about this, in the In ReMichael

4

decision, if the debtor's home reacquired equity during

5

the course of the bankruptcy, or if the debtor just

6

saved a lot ­­ worked hard and saved money, the notion

7

is by defining the estate that way, it allowed the

8

debtor to keep what the debtor had obtained during the

9

life of the Chapter 13, even when it converts.

So the ­­ so

But that

10

doesn't say a word about what happens to funds that the

11

debtor paid during the bankruptcy in order to obtain the

12

benefits of being in Chapter 13.

13

There is a clear quid pro quo here.

The

14

cost of being in Chapter 13, as this Court explained in

15

Ransom v. Lanham, and in Ransom ­­ I'm sorry, and in the

16

Lanning case, is that the cost under Section 325(a)(2)

17

is the debtor is required to pay all of his projected

18

disposable income for the benefit of his unsecured

19

creditors, that is the cost.

assets ­­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The benefit the debtor

But there's also a policy

23

argument, Mr. Goldblatt, that works against you, which

24

is that one of the things we know is that Congress

25

didn't want to disincentivize debtors from using Chapter

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

43

13.

2

the debtor is worse off for having tried Chapter 13 than

3

if he had gone into Chapter 7 initially, because he's

4

now being put to paying down debt that would have been

5

discharged under Chapter 7, and why should we give him

6

that kind of double whammy, given Congress's view that

7

we should want people to try Chapter 13 first.

8
9

And essentially, if you win, under your argument,

MR. GOLDBLATT:

So, Justice Kagan, a few

different answers, if I may.

First, under Section

10

707(d)(2)(A), a debtor with above median income may

12

7 in the first instance.

13

which includes the description at Joint Appendix Page

14

15

so I understand the question.

16
17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And here the ­­ the record

That is a very case­specific

answer.
MR. GOLDBLATT:

No, I understand that, so ­­

19

but not every ­­ the point being that not every debtor

20

is eligible to file for 7 to begin with.

21

who must file for Chapter 13, including, we believe,

22

this debtor.

23

of this case, it is indeed fanciful to believe that any

24

debtor is going­in decision about whether to file for

25

Chapter 13 is going to be affected.

There are some

More broadly, because of the happenstance

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It seems to me

4

it is always a disadvantage to the debtor who converts

5

to have begun in Chapter 13.

6

left in the pot or not, he will have paid his wages to

7

his creditors, whereas if he had filed for Chapter 7

8

immediately, he wouldn't have had to do that.

9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Whether there is any money

Justice Scalia, that's ­­ in

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it is absolutely

13

right, but your exacerbating the effect of that under

14

your proposed rule.

15

MR. GOLDBLATT:

But, Justice Kagan, not in a

16

way that ­­ that could possibly provide a material

17

effect on anyone's incentives.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

After all, the debtor ­­

No, possibly.

But it's at

19

least an extra penalty that you are imposing on him, and

20

­­ and, you know, one way to look at what Congress

21

wanted to do here is in terms of incentives.

22

way is just to say,

23

24
25

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Another

we shouldn’t penalize people for

Right.

But ­­ but, Justice

Kagan, in fairness, this isn't a penalty.

Alderson Reporting Company

After all,

Official

45
1

had the Trustee distributed these funds to creditors

2

before the date of conversion, no one would say that

3

that operated to penalize the debtor.

4

So viewing it as a penalty, I think, begins

5

with the conclusion that there's a baseline entitlement

6

to these funds to begin with.

7

is incorrect and inconsistent with the structure of the

8

Code.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that assumption is ­­

Well, but I thought that

10

Congress's baseline is to the extent possible to

11

make ­­ to ­­ to encourage Chapter 13 and not to impose

12

extra costs on the people who go there.

13

MR. GOLDBLATT:

Right.

But ­­ but it's ­­

14

with respect, it's not an extra cost.

15

the cost of being in Chapter 13 by the function of the

16

statute is the debtor is obligated to pay all of his

17

projected disposable income to the plan for the benefit

18

of his unsecured creditors as the price of being in

19

Chapter 13.

20

It is clear that

Here the Debtor obtained those benefits.

He

21

was able to keep his property throughout the time he was

22

in Chapter 13.

23

To address Justice Sotomayor's question, he

24

also was able to seek to negotiate with Chase the effort

25

to modify his mortgage.

So what happened in this case

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

46
1

is he reached the conclusion that he couldn't keep his

2

house under the monthly payments on the mortgage as it

3

existed, but as commonly occurs, particularly since the

4

financial crisis, he then undertook to negotiate with

5

Chase for a modification of the mortgage; could he

6

reduce the plan payments.

7

If ­­ if he could have gotten to a mortgage

8

modification, that would have been implemented by a

9

modified plan.

Here he ­­ they tried.

They tried for a

10

year.

11

but the opportunity to try is the benefit of Chapter 13,

12

and it can't be the case that because he was ultimately

13

unsuccessful you can say that he didn't obtain the

14

benefit during the period in which he was trying to do

15

that.

16

as ­­ as the Petitioner explains, could have converted

17

any time.

They were ultimately unsuccessful.

But ­­ but ­­

That was a voluntary decision on his part.

He ­­

18

So if he didn't want to continue to devote

19

his projected disposable income under the terms of the

20

plan while he was doing so, he had every right to

21

convert as soon as Chase receives stay relief.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Could ­­ could I ask you

23

the same question I asked your friend on the other side?

24

Assuming we find against you and ­­ and for the

25

Petitioner on the issue of ­­ of who gets this money,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

47

would the parties be able to alter that disposition in

2

the plan?

3

MR. GOLDBLATT:

So, Justice Scalia, that's a

4

really good question and one with which we have

5

struggled.

6

congressional intent, that Congress did not mean to

7

permit this.

8
9
10

We believe that the indications of

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

So you agree with

your ­­ with the other side on that point?
MR. GOLDBLATT:

Well, we ­­ on the ­­ on the

11

flip side, we ­­ we think that the better view of the Code

12

is that ­­ let me ­­ let me enter, if I can, there were

13

two different questions; right?

14

language in a plan that did that and that language ­­

15

that plan was confirmed, would it govern?

16

that, under Espinosa, is obviously yes.

One is if there was

The answer to

17

The ­­ the question I think Your Honor

18

intends to ask is if a plan said that and someone

19

objected, could that properly be confirmed?

20

view is that while that's a close question and

21

thankfully not the one presented here, that the better

22

view is that a plan that said the money goes back to the

23

debtor is sufficiently inconsistent with the structure

24
25

And our

of the Code that ­­ that ­­ that such a plan couldn't be
confirmed, but that is a much closer question than the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

48
1

one you have here where there is no language.

2

the language of the plan should be read against the

3

common law backdrop, which answers this question

4

decisively in our favor.

And so

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Typically, how ­­

6

how often are distributions made?

Every three months?

7

Every ­­

8
9

MR. GOLDBLATT:

So in ­­ in the ordinary

case, my understanding and experience is that trustees

10

will make monthly distributions.

11

sufficient funds have accumulated to make that

12

worthwhile ­­ here, what the Trustee did ­­ what the

Trustee did here makes good sense.

Sotomayor's earlier question, the ­­ the plan says what

23

that satisfies the secured claim of the secured

creditor.

25

bankruptcy vernacular, the waterfall created by the

Just the ­­

So then just going through, to use the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

49
1

plan, the funds flowed according to ­­ thereto, to the

2

unsecured creditors after the payment of administrative

3

claims.

4

That's a very common feature of plans, and

5

typically trustees, when there are material funds to be

6

distributed, will distribute on a monthly basis.

7

the Trustee didn't distribute those funds because the

8

Debtor presumably wanted the opportunity to take this

9

time to try to save their house.

Here,

So the Trustee was

10

facilitating the Debtor's efforts to save their house by

11

holding those funds to see if a modification could be

12

reached.

13

okay, now, under the plan, this money goes to unsecured

14

creditors.

15

And when it wasn't reached, the Trustee said,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It sounds like ­­

then.

18

MR. GOLDBLATT:

She ­­ she was seeking to

19

serve the objectives of the Code and the plan.

20

the reason people file for Chapter 13 primarily is to

21

save their house.

and the Trustee was trying to do, consistent with the

plan, what the purpose of the case was.

right.

she was simply keeping for the fulfillment of an

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Goldblatt, you might not

be able to answer this question, but I take it from the

fact that the solicitor general is not here in this

9

pay this money to as long as they have a clear rule; is

10

I ­­ I don't think that

that's right, Justice Kagan.

Association of Chapter 13 Trustees has come in, in

support of ­­ of our position.

the United States Trustee plays a very different role in

matters to the trustees, to any of them, whether we view

this as a role rule or only as a default rule that can

would care about that question?

answer ­­ my ­­ I believe that the better view is

probably that you cannot, because there are indications

in the Code that suggest that Congress intended the

judgment should be affirmed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

Mr. Madden, you have four minutes remaining.

3

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW M. MADDEN

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5

MR. MADDEN:

6

Two main ­­ two main points on rebuttal,

7
8
9

Thank you.

Your Honor.
First, this case isn't one where you can
make a ­­ a jump to trust law in the restatements,

10

because to make that jump, Respondent requires the Court

11

to declare that a Chapter 13 trustee doesn't hold

12

property of the estate and isn't a representative of

13

the ­­ of the estate, but, instead, holds a new species

14

of property as a bankruptcy trustee that already belongs

15

to creditors and acts as an escrow agent to creditors as

16

a representative ­­ instead of a representative of the

17

estate.

18

In our reply brief, pages 6 to 7, we point

19

to a number of indications in the Code where that would

20

be inconsistent with the way the Bankruptcy Code is

21

structured.

22

To take just one example, the Code gives a

23

trustee the right to deposit money of the estate in an

24

interest­bearing account, but in the Respondent's view,

25

after a confirmation of the plan, a Chapter 13 trustee

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

57
1

holds property of the creditors and lacks statutory

2

authorization to make that deposit.

3

It would do violence, I think, to the basic

4

structure of Chapter 13, which would have a number of

5

implications in other cases, to declare that a Chapter

6

13 trustee is no longer a representative of an estate

7

and a fiduciary of an estate, but, instead, is an agent

8

of the creditors.

9

Second, I ­­ the service of the trustee

10

point which involves Section 348(e) of the Code,

11

Congress didn't intend to tell a trustee that they can

12

do nothing at all, and they ­­ they lack any other

13

powers in a case on how to dispose of money.

14

For example, in Bankruptcy Rule 1019,

15

paragraph 4, a Chapter 13 trustee, upon conversion to

16

Chapter 7, is required to turn over property of the

17

estate to the new Chapter 7 trustee.

18

service that the trustee performs, as the trustee in the

19

case, to turn over property that is no longer property

20

of the estate to the debtor.

21

It's no more a

The service that the trustee performs is to

22

take possession of property of the estate, to examine

23

and object to claims, and when appropriate, to pay ­­ to

24

pay creditors according to the chapter of the Code under

25

which the trustee operates.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

Now, here, that's apparent, because to make

2

the payments the trustee made in this case, Respondent

3

had to file a document with the bankruptcy court to

4

recommend how to treat claims.

5

reply brief, Respondent had to tell the court that we

6

should treat Chase's $5500 claim as being allowed only

7

in the amount of a thousand dollars, because that

8

renders Chase paid in full and allows unsecured

9

creditors to obtain payments under the plan.

10

As we explained in the

But all of that only happened after the ­­

11

after the debtor converted his case to Chapter 7.

12

what Congress is intending to prevent is to have two

13

trustees operating in the same bankruptcy case on the

14

same estate dealing with the same creditors' claims.

15

That's what the termination of the service of a trustee

16

upon conversion means.

17

Unless there are further questions.
