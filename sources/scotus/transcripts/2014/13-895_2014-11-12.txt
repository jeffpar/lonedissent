ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD PILDES

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

10

MR. PILDES:

11

please the Court:

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Alabama employed rigid racial quotas, rigid

13

racial targets to design all its black majority

14

districts based on mere racial statistics alone, and

15

then used only racial demographic data to meet those

16

targets with astonishing precision.

17

not based on any consideration of what's required under

18

current conditions in Alabama as Section 5 actually

19

requires.

20

These targets were

Racial quotas in the context of districting

21

are a dangerous business.

22

minorities faced with racially polarized voting a fair

23

opportunity to elect, but they can also be a way of

24

unnecessarily packing voters by race in ways that

25

further polarize and isolate us by race.

They can be a way of giving

So you want, on the

2

one hand ­­ they obviously had to move new voters into

3

the majority­minority districts because they were all

4

underpopulated, and they need to move enough so that the

5

minorities have an opportunity to elect candidates of

6

their choice, but they can't move too many because that

7

would be packing, correct?

8
9

MR. PILDES:

Your Honor, we understand that

States are in a bind in this situation as has been true

10

under Title VII and under the Voting Rights Act under

11

Section 2.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So ­­ but they have

13

to do that.

14

those two extremes without taking race predominantly

15

into consideration?

16

They have to hit this sweet spot between

MR. PILDES:

They don't have to hit a sweet

17

pot ­­ spot.

18

path that States can take and must take to comply both

19

with their Section 5 obligations and with their equal

20

protection obligations not to use the excessive and

21

unjustified use of racial categories.

22

This Court has marked out a legitimate

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I thought the

23

Section 5 obligation, gee, it ­­ it used to require that

24

there ­­ that there be no regression in ­­ in ­­ in

25

majority black districts.

So if a district went from 69

percent black to 55 percent black, you would be in

2

trouble.

3

MR. PILDES:

Your Honor, Section 5 has

4

always required no retrogression based on the ability to

5

elect under current conditions.

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

had to move new people in them, and we had to do it in

13

such a way that there was still the 69 percent black

14

population that they're used to be in order to avoid

15

retrogression.

16

You know, these ­­ these districts

MR. PILDES:

Your Honor, retrogression has

17

never meant merely reproducing racial statistics purely

18

for their own sake.

19

to elect, preserving majority­minority districts.

20

It's meant preserving the ability

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Oh, you can say that, but

21

it meant you're ­­ the only way to be sure you're not

22

doing that is maintaining the same ­­ the same

23

various kinds of practices as you describe.

4

routinely precleared plans that reduce black populations

5

as long as they don't reduce the ability to elect.

6

And, indeed, in Alabama in the last round of

As our

7

redistricting, if you look at the blue brief of the

8

Black Caucus at the chart at 8A, you will see that

9

Alabama dramatically reduced black populations in all of

10

its districts in the Senate and in virtually all of its

11

districts in the House.

12

you'll see numbers like a 12­point reduction, a 19­point

13

reduction, a 10­point reduction, 16­point reduction.

Why do

19

you no longer need as high a percentage of minority

20

voters to maintain a situation where minority voters can

21

still elect their candidates of choice?

22

MR. PILDES:

For the reasons that this Court

23

adverted to in Shelby County and the reasons that

24

Alabama rightly celebrates in its briefs.

25

and black registration rates in Alabama now routinely

5

of black plaintiffs used to make here.

6

they said, you know, by requiring packing of ­­ of

influence statewide so you ­­ the representatives in ­­

10

minority wants because they're all packed into ­­ that's

11

the argument the other side used to be making.

12

MR. PILDES:

Yes, Your Honor.

And when the

13

Voting Rights Act legitimately requires the use of race

14

in the face of polarized voting, then there's a national

15

political judgment that reflects the tradeoffs, the cost

16

and the benefits, as there are, to designing these

17

districts.

position, that in the first case it's permitted and the

second case it isn't?

10

MR. PILDES:

No, Your Honor.

Our position

11

is that race can't be used excessively and unjustifiably

12

in either case.

And the three­judge court found ­­

Was it unjust ­­ was it

to have more minority opportunity districts?

MR. PILDES:

If they exceeded their

obligations under Section 2 and Section 5, if they went

18

beyond the limited leeway this Court has said that

19

States have, if they have the strong basis in evidence

20

that's required, if they properly interpret the Act,

21

that's the legitimate path States have that this Court

22

has marked out.

partisan purposes?
MR. PILDES:

be unconstitutional.

GENERAL VERRILLI:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

that's so, General.

4

saying is yes, we have common evidence, not all together

5

usual in a Shaw claim, but here they have evidence.

6

It's a policy statement that retrogression was going to

7

be a very main priority.

8

retrogression was defined in a certain way, as requiring

9

the maintenance of black voting population.

I don't understand why
I mean, what the plaintiffs are

I think it was number 2.

And that

10

was going to be taken into account in every single

11

12

And

Now, the fact that there's evidence, the

13

principal evidence in the case, that relates to every

14

single district and so in a sense the evidence is

15

statewide, does not make it any less a district by

Justice Kagan, but it also doesn't prove that race

test under Shaw is whether race predominates to the

it may be in other districts that it didn't, and I can

provide specific examples of that.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I guess I would

6

appreciate specific examples, because it seems to me as

7

sort of a going­in matter that when you say this is the

8

most important thing except for the Reynolds inquiry,

9

this is the most important thing, that necessarily it's

10

going to affect the way you redraw or who you put into

11

the districts.

12

GENERAL VERRILLI:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well ­­
You might not reach the

14

target in every single district, but necessarily you're

15

saying we are prioritizing this race­based ­­ this

16

17

affect every judgment we make.

18

GENERAL VERRILLI:

But the question under

19

Shaw, Your Honor, as we read the Shaw line of cases, is

20

whether that is done in derogation of traditional

21

districting criteria.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how can it not be?

If

23

you have three priorities or three criteria and you say

you're using race as a proxy in that circumstance, that

13

would violate what this Court has said in all of its

question, Your Honor, but I think if you're ­­ if you're

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

General, you say that the

7

district court erred in addressing the claim of racial

8

gerrymandering on a statewide rather than a

9

district­specific basis.

I would assume that that was

10

an error on the part of the district court only if a

11

district­specific claim was asserted by the plaintiffs,

12

but you don't address that issue.

13

GENERAL VERRILLI:

14

address it now, Your Honor.

15

quite a murky question.

16

Your Honor is quite right that the district court did

17

appear, and JSA 128 is the place where it seems clear

18

that they did to appear, to assume that this was a

19

statewide claim.

20

why, because the basic theory is that the motive

21

influenced every district and it did adjudicate the case

22

on that basis.

23

Yes.

I'm happy to

I actually think this is

1

prove, and the mere existence of this motive doesn't

2

prove it for each district, and that's our point.

3

If I could, I just would like to raise one

4

point in my remaining time going back to the question of

5

what Section 5 retrogression required.

6

Justice, you asked that question.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Chief

And when you do that,

8

will you also tell us what effect, if any, the

9

preclearance should have.

10

GENERAL VERRILLI:

Yes.

So ­­ and the two

11

are quite related.

12

you to this chart, but the key thing is to look at not

13

the difference between 2001 and the current plan, but

14

the difference between the 1993 plan and the 2001 plan.

15

The Justice Department cleared the 2001 plan

I think Professor Pildes referred

16

that Alabama submitted, and you will see for every

17

single district listed there, with maybe one exception,

18

there were significant reductions in the minority

19

percentages in those districts.

20

perfectly well that it was completely consistent with

21

its obligations under Section 5 to reduce the districts.

22

So Alabama knew

If on

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. BRASHER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
I think the Court should begin with the

21

district court's fact­finding, because the district

22

court expressly found that race did not predominate and

23

the Court can affirm on that basis and avoid addressing

24

questions about Section 5 and redistricting that are

25

unlikely to arise again because of this Court's decision

39
Alderson Reporting Company

in Shelby County.
On page 144 of the jurisdictional statement

3

appendix, the district court expressly found that we did

4

not impose a quota.

5

quote, "no bright­line rule," and what the court meant

6

is that we preserved the core of existing districts, we

7

followed preexisting district lines, we followed roads,

8

we followed county lines, municipal lines, we met the

9

needs of incumbents, and we preserved communities of

10
11

The court said that we imposed,

interest.
The plan that we proposed ­­ the plan that

12

we passed is a status quo plan.

13

plan was to preserve the status quo because the

14

Republican Party had won a majority in the legislature

15

for first time in 130 years.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The whole point of this

But the other side

17

says it was impermissible for you to preserve the status

18

quo because the opportunity for minority voters in the

19

majority minority districts to participate in the

20

electoral process had improved to the extent that

21

maintaining the status quo would be characterized as

22

packing.

23

MR. BRASHER:

Well, actually, if you look

24

at ­­ well, two responses to that, Your Honor.

25

first is that if you look at the amicus brief filed in

40
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

support of neither party by political scientists, they

2

show that black voter turnout and white voter turnout

3

and registration actually equalized in 1998.

4

there actually isn't some difference between the

5

districts in 2010 and ­­ and the new ones that we

6

propose with respect to those criteria.

So ­­ so

7

The second point, I guess, I would make to

8

that is that our ­­ our redistricting criteria ­­ our

9

nonracial redistricting criteria were coextensive with

10

the objective here to preserve these majority­black

11

districts as they have been.

12

the objective of these nonracial redistricting criteria

13

was to preserve the status quo.

14

what the United States Solicitor General was getting at,

15

is that it's difficult to disentangle the notion that we

16

should preserve the status quo with the majority­black

17

districts.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And what I mean is that

And so I think that's

Is ­­ is it fair to ­­ to

19

read the pleadings and ­­ and the submissions in this

20

case as saying that the State did not defend this plan

21

on the basis that it was for partisan purposes, but that

22

it was to comply with Section 5?

23

MR. BRASHER:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

I don't ­­
Is that ­­ is that a fair

reading of the ­­ A, of the red brief and, B, of what

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the district court found?

2

MR. BRASHER:

I don't think it's a fair

3

reading of either, Your Honor, and this is the reason

4

why.

5

here, when they were actually challenged, we were able

6

to respond and say this was for partisan political

7

reasons.

8

Senate District 11, which was specifically challenged by

9

the Alabama Democratic Conference, and the district

Certainly, with respect to specific districts

One of those districts, for example, was

10

court held that the changes to that district were based

11

on politics.

12

Now, with respect to the plan as a whole,

13

our response has always been that there is a lot of

14

factors that went into drawing the plan as a whole and

15

when it's drawing any specific district.

16

it's important here that the Plaintiffs have never

17

proposed a redistricting plan that actually meets our

18

race­neutral redistricting criteria, especially the

19

2 percent deviation in population that the legislature

20

adopted.

21

reasons.

22

And I think

And I think that's important for three

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Are you really saying that

23

that's a pleading requirement, that they have to come in

24

with a plan that meets all the rest of your criteria?

25

MR. BRASHER:

I do not believe that is a

42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

pleading requirement.

2

issue and I think the Court held that much in Cromartie.

3

And I think it's important for three reasons.

4

the legislature adopted that 2 percent deviation to end

5

the previous partisan gerrymander that the Democrats

6

adopted in 2001, where they systematically

7

underpopulated majority­black districts and

8

overpopulated majority­white districts in Republican

9

areas of the State, and that's why the Plaintiff's

I believe it's an evidentiary

First,

10

brought a partisan gerrymandering claim in the district

11

court below.

12

And the second reason is what I was alluding

13

to earlier, and that's in Easley v. Cromartie, the Court

14

held that the first step of a racial gerrymandering

15

claim is to show that there's some conceivable way to do

16

this differently that creates greater racial balance.

17

And the facts that they ­­ they've never produced a plan

18

that actually does that is a serious problem.

19

makes sense, because if you want to see if race was

20

predominant in redistricting, you take race out and then

21

you run it again and you see what happens.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that

Mr. Brasher, I mean, let me

23

just give you some numbers here from ­­ from some of

24

these districts.

25

African Americans in order to maintain the percentage of

Right?

HD 52, you needed to add 1145

43

I mean, those numbers speak for themselves,

6

don't they?

8

criteria, to maintain the black voting age population.

9

That in each of these cases, you were

MR. BRASHER:

I don't think that shows that

10

for two reasons.

11

Solicitor General that the question here is whether we

12

subordinated race­neutral redistricting criteria to hit

13

these targets.

First, I agree with the United States

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

MR. BRASHER:

That was just a coincidence?
No.

But that goes to my

16

second point, is those House districts that you were

17

reading off are in the City of Birmingham.

18

Birmingham has over 200,000 people in it, 73 percent

19

black.

20
21
22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The City of

Well, it's 73 percent, and

you hit that 73 percent exactly.
MR. BRASHER:

Well, and that's my point.

23

There are at least going to be some of those House

24

districts in Birmingham that are 73 percent black and I

25

do not believe that in a place where there's more than

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

200,000 people and 73 percent of them are black you need

2

to subordinate race­neutral redistricting criteria to

3

draw a 73 percent black district.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think you kind of do

5

actually, because, I mean, you're trying to repopulate

6

these districts, and many of these districts, yes, there

7

are many, many, many African Americans.

But as you just

8

suggested, there are also white people.

And you did it

9

so that you, you know, completely replicated the exact

10

percentage figure.

11

MR. BRASHER:

12

example of what I mean.

13

talk about in our briefs, is a single­county district.

14

It's always been a single­county district.

15

single­county district in our plan, and it's a

16

single­county district in every plan that the Plaintiffs

17

propose.

18

because that county is 70 percent black.

19

Well, I'll give you another
House District 67, which we

It's a

And it's always going to be 70 percent black

And I think the same thing could be said

20

about many of the neighborhoods in Birmingham, is that

21

these neighborhoods are 73 percent black and that's how

22

we hit the numbers.

23

otherwise.

24
25

And they certainly haven't proven

I also think that the 2 percent ­­ the
failure to propose a 2 percent plan is important because

45
Alderson Reporting Company

2

proposed, are drastically different from a 2 percent

3

plan.

4

5

6

2,000 people.

It's like comparing a plan with 100 districts to

And ­­ but even though these ­­ these plans

8

are drastically different with respect to the criteria

9

that the legislature adopted here, many of their

10

districts have exactly the same black population

11

percentage as our districts.

12

look at on page 36 of our brief where we lay out the

13

Senate districts and their own proposed plans next to

14

the Senate districts and our proposed plan.

15

look and you'll see Senate District 18, 19, 20, some of

16

the Senate districts that Justice Kagan was talking

17

about earlier, are almost exactly the same in all three

18

plans.

19

This is clearest if you

actually good­faith credibility determination from the

they made, and they said that because of the way

populations shifted, they had to change an adjoining

district, Senate District 30, which required changes

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We made changes to

Mr. ­­ Mr. Brasher, I mean,

4

usually in these cases you're looking at these

5

funny­shaped districts and you're trying to figure out

6

from the shape and from other matters whether race has

7

been used instead of traditional districting criteria.

8

But this is a very sort ­­ you know, sort of sui generis

10

case is not all the circumstantial stuff that we usually

do.

criterion except for Reynolds, and then a clear

when you have a policy statement from the State saying

second point, which is that imagine had we done the same

thing that the plaintiffs are suggesting, and we had

comply with Section 5.

3

MR. BRASHER:

And my point about that is

certainly with respect to specific districts, they were

based on partisanship, and so had they challenged

Isn't it so that both the district

8

substantial reductions in black population in the

9

preexisting majority black districts.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And if that's a

11

misunderstanding of what Section 5 requires, then the

12

whole thing is infected by that mistake.

13

MR. BRASHER:

Well, I disagree with you

14

respectfully about it being a misunderstanding, because

15

I think in 2006, Congress told us that we could not

diminish the ability to elect a black voters in a

17

preexisting majority black district.

18

My friend, Professor Pildes, testified

against the inclusion of that language in Congress, and

he told them that if they included that language, it

21

would "lock into place" the majority black districts in

22

And that was what we were setting out

Mr. Brasher, I guess I don't

7

understand your response to Justice Ginsburg.

I mean,

8

there are different interpretations of what those 2006

9

amendments mean, right?

Under one interpretation, it

10

was basically a codification of Justice Souter's

11

opinion, and so majority minority districts could be

12

transformed into influence districts.

13

On another stricter interpretation, perhaps,

14

no majority minority districts had to stay majority

minority districts.

16

percent district have to stay a 76 percent district when

17

circumstances change and when the ability to elect

18

candidates of one's choice does not require it.

blocks," which it's conceded that they do in Alabama,

time that we passed this plan that we had to comply with

Section 5, and I think we have that defense, even if we

this case is that this plan actually gives proportional

23

MR. BRASHER:

So that can't

Well, I think it can, and for

24

this reason, is because we're in charge of adopting our

25

race­neutral redistricting criteria.

62
Alderson Reporting Company

And under Easley,

Official

1

if the plaintiffs want to prove that race predominated

2

in a plan, the first step of that, and certainly the

3

easiest way to do it, is to propose some other way of

4

meeting race­neutral redistricting criteria that

5

provides greater racial balance.

6

And they haven't proposed any way to do

7

that, and the plans that they did propose, even though

8

they are 10 percent plans, are very, very similar in

9

many of these majority black districts.

So not only

10

have they not proposed a 2 percent plan that's our

11

criteria, but they actually ­­ the plans they did

12

propose are not ­­ not that different.

13

I think at the very least, the fact that the

14

plaintiffs have never proposed any way to do this

15

redistricting that actually meets the State's

16

race­neutral redistricting criteria underscores that you

17

cannot find that the district courts fact­finding here

18

was clearly erroneous, that race did not predominate,

19

and I think the Court should affirm on that basis.

20

Let me address the question of remand for a

21

second here.

22

23

position on that is internally inconsistent because the

10

MR. PILDES:

Your Honor, the key fact we

11

presented, I think, that hasn't been discussed here is

12

that the Alabama Constitution prohibits the splitting of

13

counties.

14

obligation to meet these racial targets, and that meant

15

they could override the Alabama's ­­ the Alabama

16

Constitution's protection of county boundaries and all

17

other State traditional districting principles.

18

And the 2 percent rule works the same way.

And they say they had a Supremacy Clause

19

If that's actually a Federal constitutional requirement,

20

they can also override the key protections against

21

partisan gerrymandering.

22

only hard constraints, the county boundaries are

23

political subdivision boundaries, and it means they can

24

manipulate the all­important county delegations in the

25

Alabama legislature by breaking counties into multiple

The very that few exist, the

66
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

districts and then deciding who runs the county by

2

putting their district in there.

3

Now, a second question we answered that I

4

think has been very important in this discussion ­­ and,

5

by the way, I don't want to lose track of the fact that

6

on remand, the Alabama legislature will have to comply

7

with the whole county provisions, or at least they can't

8

use this Federal excuse to split them.

9

The way most States do this is they either

10

start with traditional districting principles in the

11

core of existing districts and they look to see at the

12

end have we maintained the same number of

13

majority­minority districts, or if they start with a

14

number at the beginning, which they're not required to,

15

they ask what's necessary in current conditions to

16

preserve the ability to elect today.
