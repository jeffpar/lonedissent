ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. GANNON:

10

please the Court:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

The court of appeals held that Section 207

12

of PRIIA was unconstitutional because it believed that

13

the statute constituted an actual delegation of

14

regulatory authority to a private entity.

15

those three things is true about this statute.

It was just

That's all Lebron can

You wouldn't say that Marsh v. Alabama, the

10

company town, was a governmental agency after reading

11

that opinion, would you?

12

MR. GANNON:

No.

I would say that after

13

reading the opinion in Lebron, that the Court concluded

14

that Amtrak is a governmental entity for things that

15

Congress doesn't have control over.

16
17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, you could say the

same thing about Marsh v. Alabama.
MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that the

19

difference is that the Court recognized in Lebron that

20

Amtrak is a government­created corporation that is under

21

the government's control and that under the government's

22

control both because of the management control that it

23

has over it and because it created the purposes for

24

which Amtrak exists and the things that it has to do.

25

And then the Court there distinguished between whether Amtrak

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

5
1

is governmental for constitutional purposes that were

2

beyond Congress's control, but acknowledged that

3

Congress could control whether Amtrak was governmental

4

for other purposes, other powers and privileges of

5

government.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

If Amtrak is governmental

7

for nondelegation purposes, is it also governmental for

8

appointments clause purposes?

9

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that that follows

10

from the ­­ the way the Court approached the question

11

about the PCAOB and Free Enterprise Fund where Congress

12

had also enacted a statute that said the PCAOB was not

13

an agency or instrumentality of government, that no

14

board members or employees were going to be considered

15

officers or employees of the Federal government.

16

parties in that case, which included the United States,

17

did not dispute that the appointments clause and

18

separation of powers concerns that were at issue there

19

were applicable to the PCAOB, notwithstanding those

20

general statements by Congress.

21

The

other issue in the case, which is due process.

16

to say, even if this is a governmental entity, there are

17

some things that governmental entities can't do.

18

indeed, I think that the case law in this area relies on

19

the due process clause more than on the distinction

20

simply between public and private entities.

Only ­­ only perhaps for delegation

That is

And,

Well, to be sure, the Carter

22

Coal case talked about both nondelegation ideas and also

due process issues.

since it wasn't decided by the court of appeals.

that ­­ for two principal reasons.

One is that what is

in the due process cases.

11

12

case.

13

Carter Coal, because ­­ because the analogy to those

14

things here is the statutory preference requirement

15

rather than the antecedent metrics and standards.

16

This is not like the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

But the statutory

17

preference requirement requires ­­ would require

18

consideration of whatever is determined by this body,

19

right?

20

MR. GANNON:

The statutory preference

21

requirement is independent of the metrics and standards

22

and preexists them.

23

Transportation Board would be enforcing in a proceeding

24

under Section 24308(f).

MR. GANNON:

The metrics and standards play

a triggering and gatekeeping role.

3

provisions are reprinted in the government's brief on

4

pages 15A and 16A of the appendix, that the ­­ the

5

investigation by the Surface Transportation Board is

6

triggered by their having been a failure by Amtrak to

7

satisfy the metrics and standards.

8

that ­­ that is ­­ and if we're talking about the due

9

process cases, that is not the prohibition that

The ­­ these

But I think that ­­

10

the Court has been concerned about.

11

cases like Roberge, which talked about Cusack, it said

12

that it's okay to have something that is presumptively

13

bad banned by the legislature.

14

If you look at

Here, the analogy to that is the statutory

15

preference, and it's okay, then, to allow a private

16

party to relax its application in certain circumstances.

17

And we think that's the role that the metrics and

18

standards play here, because Congress could have allowed

19

Amtrak to ask for an STB investigation into violations

20

of the statute any time it wanted to.

21

they said is that it is only ­­ you are only going to

22

get that investigation when you have failed to ­­ to

23

perform at an adequate level such that we think there's

24

been adequate injury.

25

you are going to have to establish that the injury to

And instead what

And then in that investigation,

you was caused by the violation of the statute.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So in your ­­ in your

3

view, the case would come out the same way if Amtrak

4

could issue these metrics and standards entirely on its

5

own, without consultation with the ­­ or cooperation

6

with the government.

MR. GANNON:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. GANNON:

Same ­­ same case ­­
One of the ­­
­­ same result?
One prong of our argument is,

10

yes, that because this is not regulatory in that sense,

11

this is more like the neighbors being able to veto the

12

billboard in the neighborhood in Cusack, which the Court

13

said was okay in Roberge, because the statutory

14

preference is presumptively bad.

15

statutory preference by the freight railroads were the

16

thing that Congress wanted to be enforceable here, and

17

the metrics and standards just cabin the circumstances

18

in which Amtrak can seek that type of enforcement.

But there is ­­ there is ­­ that would

depend upon the reading of the beginning clause of

(f)(1) which refers to if on­time performance fails to

10

satisfy 80 percent for two consecutive quarters or the

11

service quality isn't complied with for two quarters,

12

then those are the circumstances in which an

13

investigation could be requested and ­­ in which

14

instance the STB would need to start the investigation

15

or the STB could initiate the investigation.

16

And there is an open question about that

17

first clause about whether the 80 percent on­time

performance reference is something that has to be

seems like the ability of the neighbors to veto the

cooperation under the regime in which the metrics and

Well, you know, I'm quite

5

interested in the government's view of this case, and I

6

hope you will calm me down.

7

The reason that I find it interesting is

8

because it seems to me there are hundreds, maybe

9

thousands of organizations that set standards for the

10

industry.

11

memoranda or authority that ask them to do it, the most

12

noted being ICANN which sets all the standards for the

13

internet.

14

And some of them operate under government

Now, it also seems to me very possible that

15

a member of such an organization that fails to follow

16

the standard could run afoul of other government rules

17

or other agency rules or other laws, for example, by

18

stalling the internet delivery of services and being

19

delayed, and violating some FCC requirement.

20

I know that there are about 2 or 300 international

21

organizations that we belong to, to do such things, I

22

just wonder what the implications would be if you lose

23

this case.

24

if a government, say, Congress, agency, Commerce

Department, says to a group of private people set

2

a member fails to meet a standard, it runs afoul of a

3

different rule, such as a rule that you have to have a

4

certain speed on the Internet or some such thing.

5

we to hold that unconstitutional, I have a feeling ­­

6

that this is what I want assurance on that I'm wrong ­­ that

7

it would work havoc, possibly with the Internet,

possibly with industry throughout the United States, I

with the 200 or so organizations regulated by treaty.

this isn't a big­deal case.

Don't worry about it.

I think it depends upon how

broad the Court's ruling is.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

standards which equal legislation and as a result of

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DUPREE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

2

The constitution does not permit Congress to

3

create a corporation, deem it nongovernmental, and then

launch it into the commercial sphere with a for­profit

5

mandate and then vest it with regulatory authority over

6

other companies in the same industry.

The text of the constitution places all

As far as I'm concerned,

That's this model that Congress enacted.

And here, Congress plainly could have given

20

Amtrak an advisory role, Section 207 (a) gives all sorts

21

of entities and participants with a stake in these rules

22

an advisory role.

23

that Congress could not easily have drafted that statute

24

to give Amtrak an advisory role.

25

And there is absolutely no reason

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if the government

agency, the FRA, it says, you know, what Amtrak

2

proposes, the government's assent is essential to this

3

scheme, right?

4

MR. DUPREE:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

But

5

I think the key point here is that Amtrak's assent is

6

also essential.

halt a regulation that Amtrak wanted to put in effect, but the

8

constitutional advice here is that Amtrak has the same

9

power.

So, to be sure, the government could

regulations in our two prior cases Currin and Rock

3

MR. DUPREE:

Yes, the difference in those

4

cases, Justice Sotomayor, is that in those cases it was

5

a federal government that drafted the regulation.

6

what happened at that point was that Congress gave the

7

industry ­­ or in those cases a super majority of the

8

industry the power to vote whether to subject themselves

9

to the regulation.

authority becomes effective.

that but at the same time that is the line, the precise

9

line that this Court explicitly drew both in Curran and

10

in J.W. Hampton where it said that allowing this vote of

11

the regulated parties, that doesn't amount to

12

legislative action.

13

is the line that this Court has reverted to time and

14

again.

15

Agreed it may be a fine line but it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know what they

16

meant because they were subjecting themselves to

standards.

18

MR. DUPREE:

Well, and I would simply go

19

back to our point that we never had a vote in this

20

process.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What do you make of the

22

provision to which you referred earlier that says that

23

the metrics and standards shall be incorporated into the

24

operating agreements to the greatest extent practicable

25

or to the extent practicable.

If a particular railroad

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

33
1

took the position that it will never agree to the

2

incorporation of the metrics and standards into an

3

operating agreement, is there anything that the federal

4

government could do?

5

MR. DUPREE:

Well, Justice Alito, I think in

6

that situation what would likely happen if Amtrak and

7

the freight railroad could not reach agreement and

8

therefore there was no agreement on the terms of the

9

operating agreement, is that the Surface Transportation

10

Board ultimately would be called upon to step in and

11

essentially dictate terms or help the parties reach

12

terms and proscribe the terms of the operating

13

agreement.

14

hasn't yet arisen but it would not surprise me in the

15

slightest if Amtrak's argument at that point to the

16

Surface Transportation Board was pointing to the

17

language of 207 (c) and saying, this freight railroad is

18

under a statutory mandate that it shall amend its

19

agreements to the extent practicable.

20

the statute suggests that the determination as to

21

practicability is something that falls within the

22

exclusive jurisdiction of the freight railroads.

23

statutory language doesn't suggest that.

24

were to hold that, I certainly wouldn't quarrel with it,

25

but I'm not quite sure the statutory language gets you

And I think in that situation ­­ again, it

I think one fundamental flaw with the

3

statute which we've not yet touched on, an additional

4

flaw, is the problem of accountability.

5

course, is the concern that has animated this Court's

6

non delegation and due process jurisprudence.

7

you have a situation where Congress, the President and

8

Amtrak itself have repeatedly declared to the public in

9

explicit terms that Amtrak is not the government.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That, of

And here

Do you think that's

11

dispositive?

12

labels that Congress decides to put on these things is

13

not of particular relevance.

14

Because I've always thought that the

MR. DUPREE:

I'm not so sure I would go so

15

far as to say it's dispositive, Justice Kagan.

16

think it's highly relevant.

17

spoken about transparency and accountability in the

18

legislative process, what it's been talking about is the

19

ability of the public to look at a regulation or a law

20

and make a judgment as to where to assign blame.

21

when you have all parties involved assuring the public

22

that Amtrak is not a government actor, I think the

public is entitled to take the President and the

MR. DUPREE:

I agree.

But I think

7

what resolves this case is the fact that Amtrak operates

8

under a statutory mandate to conduct its affairs as

9

though it were a non­governmental entity and a

10
11

for­profit corporation.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

In fact, in the briefing ­­
Well, the post office is

12

supposed to be a for­profit corporation, too, to the

13

same extent, right?

14

MR. DUPREE:

Well, yes, Justice Kagan, keep

15

in mind the post office is expressly created as a

16

federal entity, it's in our Constitution and in Federal

17

statutory law it says the post office is an agency or an

18

entity within the executive branch.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

than this label, what suggests that this is not the

label.

In other words, the organic

So it may be a little more than just a

12

But taking Your Honor's point, I think what

13

makes Amtrak not the government for nondelegation

14

purposes is that Amtrak's officers and employees are not

15

Federal employees, they don't take an oath of office and

16

they are constrained by various financial incentives and

17

statutory mandates to operate Amtrak not in the common

18

good, not as a neutral, disinterested regulator would,

19

but as a for­profit commercial actor.

20

That's actually the very point that Amtrak

made to this Court in its Lebron brief where it said

both to nondelegation and due process and it did an

didn't occur until the metrics and standards came into

effect.

So Mr.

Well, first, I would say if

11

that's true, that, to me, strikes me as a pretty plain

12

regulatory effect in that the metrics and standards are

2

given Amtrak the power to define the terms and to draft

3

the regulations in which it may bring an enforcement

5

If ­­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dupree, I mean, one way

6

to look at this on the delegation question, not on the

7

due process question but on the delegation question, is

8

that there is government all over this at every step,

9

that there is all kinds of supervision of Amtrak itself,

10

no matter what Amtrak does that; but with respect to the

11

metrics and standards, particularly, that there is no

12

way Amtrak is actually going to be able to get anything

13

unless the FRA comes aboard, and that furthermore, that

14

even those metrics and standards are useless unless the

15

Surface Transportation Board decides to enforce the

16

preference requirement.

17

So there is, like, no place at which a

18

private actor can do something itself in this scheme, it

19

would seem to me.

20

MR. DUPREE:

Well, I ­­ I take the point

21

that the FRA is involved in the development of the

22

standards, but I don't think it follows from ­­ from

23

that premise to say that Congress can give a private

systematic ways, that they can nationalize things,

7

that ­­ that they now measure things in the same

8

fashion, they use minutes instead of seconds or

metrics and standards that wouldn't make sense to go in

I think that it's also the case that

Mr. Dupree is talking about Amtrak as a competitor of

wrong analogy, that Amtrak is effectively like a

held that Amtrak was able to initiate a condemnation

proceeding for rail property before the ICC, and its

5

determination that it needed that particular property

6

had a strong presumption that it was going to be true

and governing in that proceeding.

8

that was not an impermissible delegation of eminent

domain authority, because the ICC made the ultimate

determination there, notwithstanding the fact that

Amtrak had to trigger the proceeding and Amtrak's

12

decision to do so created a statutory presumption that

13

there would be need.

14

I think that Mr. Dupree also is concerned

15

about the need for Amtrak's consent here.

16

back to the very

17

brief that under cases like Currin and Rock Royal

Cooperative, the fact that the government needed to

19

secure the consent of Amtrak is not something that makes

20

that a delegation outside the government.

they had the pen along the way, the veto power is what

22

is most important, and we think it's especially easy to
