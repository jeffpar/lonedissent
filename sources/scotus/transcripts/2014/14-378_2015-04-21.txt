ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The briefing in this Court has narrowed

12

considerably the disagreement among the parties.

13

all agree that the Fourth Circuit misconstrued the mens

14

rea element for a ­­ a criminal offense under the

15

Controlled Substance Analogue Act, and we further agree

16

that the jury instructions actually given in this case

17

were erroneous.

18

We now

Instead, we and the government now agree

19

that to prove an offense, the government must show that

20

the defendant knowingly distributed an analogue.

21

further agree that the government may do that by showing

22

that the defendant knew that the substance in question

23

had the characteristics that made it an analogue under

24

the statute.

25

Where we may disagree is over the

Alderson Reporting Company

And we

Official

4
1

government's alternative theory that it can instead show

2

that the defendant knew that the substance was illegal

3

or regulated.

4

illegal or regulated under the statute of conviction,

5

the Controlled Substances Act itself, we would agree,

6

but the government would simply lose because, as it's

7

acknowledged, the evidence in this case tended to show

8

that my client did not believe that his conduct violated

9

the CSA itself.

10

If all the government means by that is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But just to make sure I

11

understand all that you're agreeing on, you do agree

12

that if the defendant knew that the substance was

13

illegal under the Controlled Substances Act or the

14

Analogue Act, even though the defendant didn't know the

15

chemical structure or the particular effects ­­ say that

16

the dealer had handed him a box and said this is our new

17

analogue which is illegal under this ­­ under the

18

Analogue Act, you ­­ you agree that that is sufficient

19

for a conviction.

20

MR. RUSSELL:

We do agree with that.

And I

21

think that that is simply a special application of the

22

general rule that the defendant has to know the facts

23

that make his conduct unlawful because he knows in that

24

circumstance the only fact he needs to know in order to

25

know that what he's doing is illegal.

5

say, well, this is chemically modified, but it's

6

substantially similar and the jury sits there knowing

7

that it doesn't have to listen to this?

8

does that work?

9

What about the expert testimony from

Is that still put on in the trial?

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

They do have to show that

10

because the government still has to prove that it is, in

11

fact, an analogue.

12

So they have to both show that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but does a jury have

to understand the chemical testimony?
MR. RUSSELL:

They've ­­ they've got to make

16

the determination that it is, in fact, chemically

17

substantially similar.

25

defendant now doesn't have to know ­­ you agree the

Those ­­ those the government must

But what we have out of the way is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

defendant doesn't have to understand the chemical

2

structure?

3

MR. RUSSELL:

He doesn't have to understand

4

the chemical structure if the government can prove that

5

the defendant knew that the substance was illegal under

6

the Controlled Substances Act itself.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the government

8

has given up a lot getting to this point and I think

9

you've just given up a lot.

10

I would have thought your ­­ your position

11

that you have to know that it's regulated under the

12

chemical substances or Controlled Substances Act, it

13

seems to me is ­­ is contrary to the proposition that

14

ignorance of the law is no excuse.

15

know ­­ I didn't know this was regulated, you would say

16

he's ­­ he's innocent because he didn't know the law.

If you didn't

17

I thought your position was that you do have

18

to know, as in all the other cases in the mens rea area,

19

the ­­ the facts that make your conduct illegal.

20

don't have to know that it's illegal.

21

MR. RUSSELL:

You

That ­­ that is certainly our

22

principal position.

23

that either ­­ whether you consider it a special

24

exception to that rule or a special application to that

25

rule, if the government can show that the defendant

We are willing to say, however,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

knows that the substance is illegal under the statute of

2

conviction, that serves the basic purpose of the

3

knowledge of fact requirement, which is something ­­

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
know, he's innocent.

6

MR. RUSSELL:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8
9

And if he doesn't

If he does not ­­
If he's ignorant of

that law, he's not guilty.
MR. RUSSELL:

Well, he's not guilty unless

10

the government can show that he knows that the substance

11

has the characteristics of ­­ of an analogue, in which

12

case his ignorance of the law is not an excuse.

13

So the government has two options:

It can

14

prove the facts, the factual knowledge in the way that

15

this Court described in Staples and has applied in other

16

cases involving prohibited items.

17

acknowledge that if they can, instead of that, show that

18

he knew that this is illegal under the statute, that's

19

good enough because ­­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But we're willing to

And ­­ and I take it that's

21

the same as under the Controlled Substances Act itself;

22

is that right?

23

either show the person knew it was heroin or you can

24

show, well, the person didn't know it was heroin, but

25

the person did know that it was some drug that was on

That's the analogy, is that you can

3

MR. RUSSELL:

That's right.

And where we

4

disagree with the government is that it construes some

5

of the lower court cases that say that as saying the

6

broader thing, which is ­­

I'm sorry.

You keep

He

He just has to know it's

10

illegal, that some law regulates it; otherwise, he's not

11

going to know what the number of the law is or the

12

Controlled Substance Act.

MR. RUSSELL:

No.

I ­­ I would disagree

20

with that.

21

disagreement we have with the government here, is that

22

it's not enough to show that the defendant thinks that

23

it's illegal generally or that it's unlawful under an

24

import statute or State law.

25

And I think that's the principal

JUSTICE SCALIA:

All right.

Alderson Reporting Company

The ­­ the

Official

9
1

government would say if he's selling it without paying

2

the sales tax, he knows that that's illegal, that's

3

enough to convict him under the Controlled Substances

4

Act.

5

MR. RUSSELL:

Potentially, I ­­ I think

6

that that may be their argument, you know.

the example in our brief of somebody who knows he's

8

selling Cuban cigars in violation of the import ban.

9

So we give

He

substance, but that knowledge doesn't equate ­­ you

11

wouldn't say that somebody in that case knows he's

12

selling a controlled substance, simply because it turns

13

out, unbeknownst to him, that the cigars have marijuana

14

in them.

15

That's not the way that you use the English

16

language.

case involving a drug that isn't an analogue, a drug

24

illegal drug, go distribute it.

25

And let's say that the facts

The distributor gives it to the person who's

And the person then

2

Now, is it ­­ is that sufficient ­­ is that

3

evidence sufficient to take the case to the jury so the

4

jury can find ­­ the jury can decide whether there's

5

circumstantial evidence that the person who distributed

6

the drugs knew that it was a controlled substance under

7

Federal law as opposed to one of the few things that is

8

illegal under State law, but not under Federal law?

9

MR. RUSSELL:

Yes, I think that's sufficient

10

evidence to go to the jury.

11

whether to make that inference.

12

where the defendant puts on countervailing evidence that

13

he, in fact, didn't believe it violated Federal law, or

14

when ­­ or if the defendant is able to explain, yeah, I

15

thought it was illegal because I thought it was in

16

violation of an import statute, then it's up to jury to

17

decide whether to believe that.

18

ought to conclude that mens rea wasn't established

19

unless the government can show that the defendant knew

20

the characteristics of the substance that made it an

21

analogue.

So what ­­ what do we make of what he was

advertising this to be, Speed­Up, and selling it at a

20

MR. RUSSELL:

I think what it reflects ­­

21

what a jury certainly could find it to reflect, and I

22

think what the truth of the matter is, is that it shows

23

that Petitioner thought he'd found a loophole to the

24

Federal drug laws; that so long as something was not

25

on the schedules, even if it had drug­like

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

15
1

effects, he could sell it and he could sell it at

2

whatever price the market would bear.

3

You know, certainly, the government can

4

point to that kind of evidence to suggest that he knew

5

that his conduct violated the Controlled Substances Act.

6

But here, of course ­­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I ­­ I thought you said that

8

that kind of evidence was enough to get you to a jury,

9

right?

10

MR. RUSSELL:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
That the defendant acted

12

furtively or that he sold these for incredibly inflated

13

prices, that all of that, it's not ­­ it's not the thing

14

itself, but it's evidence of the thing that the

15

government is trying to prove.

16

MR. RUSSELL:

That's right.

And I think it

17

gets to the jury, but it doesn't prove what the

18

government has to prove here, which is harmless error

19

beyond a reasonable doubt.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then if I can just

21

understand.

22

that the only thing that's possibly separating you and

23

the government ­­ we'll see if it is separating you and

24

the government ­­ is this question of what happens if

25

the defendant knew it was illegal under something other

3

government?

4

MR. RUSSELL:

And that's the

I think that's true with

5

respect to our legal interpretation.

6

think that you ought not to reach that because this

7

entire regulated status theory was raised for the first

MR. RUSSELL:

But ­­ but assuming that ­­

14

that the government cannot prove any belief in

position, I think that the only disagreement about the

meaning of the law between the government and us now is

this question of whether it's sufficient as a matter of

law for the government to show that the defendant

25

believed that the substance was unlawful under some law

sufficient, what ­­ what else does the government have

characteristics of the substance that made it an

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

Would you mind repeating

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I'll try.

5

Suppose you have to show, and I think you

3

it?

6

do, that the defendant did know it is an analogue, say

7

to cocaine.

8

first way is you could show that this defendant, being a

9

graduate in chemistry, knows what the chemical

There are two ways you could do that.

The

10

composition of cocaine is, knows what the chemical

11

composition of this other substance is, and knows they

12

are the same.

13

very often.

You're not going to be able to do that

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Another possibility is you

16

could show that he knows that this particular substance

17

is banned by a law that is called the ­­ the Analogue

18

Act, because obviously if he knows that it is banned by

19

the Act that bans analogues, it must be an analogue.

20

Those are two ways you could prove knowledge.

21

To prove that it is banned by the

22

Anti­Turkey Shoot Act proves nothing about his knowledge

23

that this is an analogue.

24

as you are trying to say, I think, that some other

25

illegality is enough to convict, I no longer understand

And, therefore, once you say,

Alderson Reporting Company

31

the argument.

2

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, the argument, as

3

Justice Sotomayor pointed out, in the real world,

4

defendants don't tend to know specific provisions of

5

Federal law or State law, but they do tend to know

6

whether what they're doing is illegal or not.

7

our view is that the knowing or intentional standard in

8

Section 841(a) describes a culpable state of mind.

9

one way to prove that culpable state of mind is to prove

10

that the defendant knowingly or intentionally engaged in

11

the act ­­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so

And

Yes, but then you're not ­­

13

then you are saying the defendant does not have to know

14

it is an analogue, and that, I think, you don't want to

15

say.

16

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, what we're saying ­­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because you could think it

18

was banned by some other act, and that would make you

19

know that it is that thing that the other act bans.

20

doesn't tend to show it's an analogue.

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

It

Well, what I'm

22

saying is defendants tend to believe that what they're

23

doing is illegal, not under any particular provision,

24

but just generally they believe it's illegal.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we ­­

That's not what the statute

19

It has to be

Well, just ­­ let me just

Alderson Reporting Company

34

But we think certainly it's sufficient if a

defendant believes that what he's doing is illegal under

principles if the Court held more broadly than that,

it's not a question whether you know anything about the

6

under the law.

7

But then I don't know how broad the

principle is that you just have to know what you're

doing is ­­ would raise a doubt in the jury's mind about

10

whether you knew it was legal or not.

11

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, so I ­­ I have two

types of responses, which I'll just point out so that I

13

can come back to them in case I don't get through them

14

all.

15

give you sort of a real world example of how this works

16

in the CSA context.

17

The first is a doctrinal point.

And second, I can

The doctrinal point is that this Court has

18

held that there are other ways to prove knowledge other

19

than that a defendant actually knew a critical fact.

20

For example, the government can prove willful blindness.

21

And the Court has explained, as recently as the

22

Global­Tech case, that the reason you allow willful

23

blindness to substitute for knowledge is not because

24

being willfully blind to a fact is the same as knowing

25

the fact.

It's because a person who is willfully blind

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

36

to a fact has the same culpable state of mind as the

2

person who knows the fact.

3

And so we would submit that a person who

4

engages in an act intentionally and correctly believes

5

that doing that is illegal is at least as culpable, if

6

not more culpable, than the person who knows all the

7

facts that make his conduct illegal.

Alderson Reporting Company

42

But it actually seems to me to be a real theoretical

2

difference, which has implications far beyond this case.

3

Then what Mr. Russell has suggested is two

4

ways of showing that a defendant knew a fact.

5

fact that he was distributing an analogue, and you might

6

know it because you know the chemical structure and all

7

its properties, or you might know it because you know ­­

8

you know, somebody has given you a box and said, this is

9

an analogue prohibited under the Analogue Act, and so

10
11

That the

you know that it's an analogue.
So those are two ways of knowing a fact.

12

But you're saying that in addition to knowing a fact,

13

the mens rea is satisfied if you can just show that the

14

defendant knew he was acting culpably in violation of

15

some law.

16

could be put on to any law.

17

all the facts that a statute says you have to know, the

government has an alternative way of proving its case,

which is just to say, oh, look at ­­ look, you were

10

the defendant correctly believes that what he's doing is

illegal, he doesn't have to have any sense of what law

he's violating.

13

Now, willfulness is generally thought to be

14

a much higher mens rea standard than knowing or

15

intentional, and although this Court has never addressed

this precise question, both the model penal code and the

satisfy all the lower ones.

way of proving that he knew he was distributing a

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it's not something that

definition.
MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

12

the courts of appeals dealing with a substance called

16

khat, which is K­H­A­T.

17

the Horn of Africa, generally, and if you pick the

18

leaves off the plant and chew them, it gives a stimulant

19

effect.

20

because fresh leaves of khat contain a substance called

21

cathinone, which is a Schedule I substance illegal under

22

the CSA.

23

Khat is a plant that's grown in

And the reason it gives a stimulant effect is

It sort of produces amphetamine­like effects.

So khat is legal in many places in the

24

world.

25

because, again, it contains ­­ when freshly picked,

It's illegal to distribute it in this country

Alderson Reporting Company

contains a Schedule I controlled substance.

2

So there are a number of cases where the

3

government has prosecuted people under the CSA for

4

distributing cathinone in the form of distributing khat.

5

And defendants in those cases have said, Look, I didn't

6

know it had cathinone, I was distributing khat.

7

legal where I come from, I have no what the chemical is

in this ­­ in this plant.

enough because he knows it's an analogue.

24

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now you're saying if he

54
1

knows it's illegal generally under the drug laws, that

2

should be evidence of the fact that he knows it's an

3

analogue because let's ask him why do you think it's

4

illegal under the analogue ­­ I mean, why do you think

5

it's illegal under the drug laws?

6

its not a listed substance.

7

sort of be stuck there because he doesn't want to say,

8

hmm, because it's a lot like cocaine.

I'm going to tell you

Why could it be?

And he'd

9

MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Because once he says

because it's a lot like cocaine, he knows it's an

12

analogue.

13

examples, it's not because he thinks it's a veterinarian

14

law.

15

And if say, using my, you know, far out

So what it should be ­­ is this right ­­ if

16

I follow your argument, you'd say the fact that he knows

17

it's illegal under the drug laws, is, itself, evidence

18

that he knows it's an analogue, but he's free to come up

19

if he wants with some kind of basis for saying that even

20

though he thought it was illegal under the drug laws, he

21

thought it was illegal under some other law that had to

22

do with postage stamps or something.

23

should be, if the jury believes that, get him off.

24

Have I got it basically right?

25

MS. HARRINGTON:

That ­­ that

That's a correct

characterization of our narrower argument, yes, that

believed what he was doing violated some drug law,

4

that's enough to prove that he knowingly distributed an

5

analogue.

If we can prove that the defendant

What would "some drug

law" be other than the CSA and the Analogue Act?
MS. HARRINGTON:

Right.

In the Federal

context, there wouldn't be, but, again, our point is

10

really that the defendant, generally, does not have a

11

specific law in mind.

12

doing is breaking the law.

13

He just knows that what he's

And so when Petitioner says we have to prove

14

that he knew he was violating the ­­ the statute of

15

conviction, we think that's a ­­ much too high a burden.

16

The only time you have to do that is when you have a

17

willful standard in the tax evasion context; right?

18

This is certainly not that context.

We

19

think just general knowledge of illegality and intention

20

to engage in the prohibited act is sufficient.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
must relate to drugs.

And, you know, to ­­ Petitioner suggests that the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So even if he comes back and

11

says, Yes, I thought that what I was doing was wrong,

12

but ­­ but it wasn't because I thought this was an

13

analogue, it was for some other reason.

14

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, we think if he came

15

back, for example, and said, Well, I thought it violated

16

the Virginia Controlled Substances Act ­­ and because

17

not ­­ some States control more drugs than the

didn't know it violated a Federal drug law, we think

that would not be a defense.

sufficient.

So, again, we think that

there is ­­ that a broader view would be correct.

6

we are perfectly happy with a ruling in this case that

we don't think that there is necessarily a basis for

limiting the knowledge of illegality specifically to

drug laws.

11

belief in illegality, we think that's enough.

12

But

As long as you tie the conducts to the

But we think it's definitely sufficient for

13

this case to hold that when the government proves a

14

belief that ­­ that he is violating a drug law, that

15

that's enough.

16
17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So ­­ so the conduct is

related to the genus of illegality.

18

MS. HARRINGTON:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Right.
I think ­­ I think

20

there are areas where criminal defendants do try to

21

tailor their conduct to fall within, if they're captured

22

or caught, particular laws but not others.

23

cases where that's true.

I recall

24

I mean, hypothetically, let's say they know

25

that this much marijuana or cocaine is a misdemeanor.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

58
1

If they got up to this much, you know, it's 15 years

2

mandatory minimum, so they structure their activities to

3

fall within the lower level.

4

You would be able to prosecute them,

5

according to your theory, for the big 15­year mandatory

6

whatever, if they happen to go beyond the misdemeanor

7

amount.

8
9

MS. HARRINGTON:

Certainly, yes.

You know,

if a defendant believed that he was distributing 1 pound

10

of cocaine and it turned out ­­ and that's probably,

11

it's, you know, I don't know what the right numbers are,

12

but say he believed he was distributing 1 pound of

13

cocaine.

14

cocaine and there's different sentence that applies for

15

5 pounds.

16

pounds of cocaine, then I think that would be sufficient

17

under the Controlled Substance Act.

18

Turned out, he was distributing 5 pounds of

If we can prove he actually distributed 5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what does that

19

do to your theory that they have to ­­ what they have to

20

know is that it's illegal under the drug laws.

21

What ­­ what was illegal ­­ what they knew

22

was the misdemeanor amount.

23

that doesn't ­­ it doesn't matter that they ­­ doesn't

24

matter that they didn't know they were distributing the

25

larger amount.

Alderson Reporting Company

MS. HARRINGTON:

So I took your hypothetical

2

to be that he knew what he was doing was illegal.

just ­­

4
5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

He

He knew what he was

doing was an ­­ was a misdemeanor.

6

MS. HARRINGTON:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Okay.
Because of the

8

amount.

9

because he didn't know he had that much of the drug.

10

He didn't know it was a going to be a felony

MS. HARRINGTON:

Well, under our view, if he

11

knew what he was doing violated a drug law, which I

12

think would be the case in your hypothetical, then

13

that's sufficient.

14

Now, of course, if he thought what he was

15

distribute ­­ what he was distributing was oregano and

16

it turned out to the marijuana, then we think that

17

wouldn't be sufficient because he would have believed

18

what he was doing was innocent, and he wouldn't have

19

known the facts that made his conduct illegal.

20

In this case, there are ­­ there are plenty

21

of facts to show that Petitioner really believed that

22

what he was doing was illegal, and it turned out that he

23

was correct.

24

baggies and vials instead of having sort of more

25

traditional commercial packaging.

Again, he sold his products in little

Alderson Reporting Company

He charged $450 an

2

belief that he thought that they were aromatherapy

He named ­­

Don't you

Not in the illegal drug ­­

12

I mean, you know, the free market works in the illegal

13

drug context the same way it works everywhere else.

14

But I think it's certainly evidence that he

15

knew what he was selling was a drug, and it was an

16

illicit drug.

17

And he named the analogues after ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19

so he was charging what people are willing to pay for

20

that.

21

MS. HARRINGTON:

That's all.

And ­­ and

He also acted furtively.

22

You know, he sort of hid his products on his website.

23

He wouldn't answer direct questions from his customers

24

about which high, you know, was most like for the

25

controlled substances.

Alderson Reporting Company

61

And so we think there is certainly

2

sufficient evidence to show that Petitioner in this case

3

believed that ­­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, the Petitioner's

5

counsel agrees that there is sufficient evidence to

6

convict under a proper instruction.

7

MS. HARRINGTON:

Yes.

I mean, I think he

8

has a different view of what a proper instruction is.

9

And so, again, I understand that the Court

10

generally remands for application of harmless error.

11

think that would be appropriate in this case,

12

particularly, because the government didn't ask for this

13

instruction because it was following circuit precedent

14

below, and then defending a harsher instruction that was

15

actually given in the case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN K. RUSSELL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUSSELL:

Let me start with the

instruction.
Justice Ginsburg, even under the

14

government's interpretation of the jury instructions as

15

requiring the jury to find that the defendant knew about

16

the similarity in effect, the government acknowledges it

17

didn't require any knowledge about the similarity

18

instruction.

19

this ­­ the instruction here was inadequate, even under

20

the government's new view of the law.

21

question here is simply whether or not they're entitled

22

to take advantage of that, and to make a harmless error

23

argument, based on a theory that they only developed in

24

this Court.

25

So the government has acknowledged that

And so the

But let me ­­ with respect to the general

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

63
1

legal questions, let me start with ­­ with addressing

2

their broad "any law will do" position.

3

simply, as I understand them now, premised on their

4

thought that all the statute requires is culpable state

5

of mind, but that's not what the statute says.

6

doesn't say distribute an analogue culpably, it says

7

distribute knowingly.

And that is

It

8

And this Court has repeatedly said that

9

knowing distribution of a prohibited item requires

10

knowledge of the facts.

11

exception that we've discussed that you can meet that by

12

showing that there's knowledge under the law of

13

conviction itself, but there is no precedent from this

14

Court that gives the court ­­ gives prosecutors the

15

option of either proving the facts, the defendant knew

16

the facts that made the conduct unlawful, or simply that

17

he acted culpably or that he knew that the conduct was

18

unlawful under some law.

19

And there may be a ­­ an

Now, with respect to their fallback

20

position, that it has to be illegal under a drug law,

21

we're getting closer.

22

say, as some courts have said, including Hussein, which

23

is a case they feature prominently in their brief, that

24

it has to be a Federal anti­drug abuse law.

25

truth of the matter is there's only one of those, but

We would agree, if they were to

Alderson Reporting Company

Now, the

Official

64
1

the ­­ the value in that articulation is that it makes

2

clear that the defendant doesn't have to know the name

3

of the statute.

4

But if the government's position is that

5

it's enough that it be under State drug abuse laws, and

6

Justice Alito, there are lots of State Analogue Acts,

7

and there are lots of States that have been ahead of the

8

government in putting on their schedules things that are

9

analogues, including some of the substances in this

10

case.

11

That's clearly not what this Court has ever

12

had in mind in interpreting the word "knowingly" in a

13

statute.

14

culpable enough.

15

it is entitled to know that that word is going to get

16

the same interpretation that it has in the past.

17

government points to cases like Bryan in which the Court

18

has said, in addition to knowing the facts, we must also

19

know something about the law.

20

know, willfulness is enough to establish knowing ­­

21

knowing distribution.

22

it's not simply that they have some general knowledge of

23

unlawfulness, they also know the facts that make the

24

conduct unlawful.

25

And it's up to Congress to decide what is
And when it uses the word "knowingly,"

JUSTICE ALITO:

The

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The government always

Sorry.

If a State law

13

calls it an analogue, he knows he's violating the State

14

law, he knows this is an analogue.

15

MR. RUSSELL:

Well, if ­­ if he knew that he

16

was violating a State Analogue Act that had the same

17

definition under Federal law, I think you could then ask

18

the jury to infer that he knew that he was violating the

19

Federal law.

20

said, the government's evidence is simply going to be

21

that the defendant knew that the conduct was unlawful

22

somehow.

23
24
25

But most of the time, as my colleague

So, Justice Alito, the

5

government never has to prove the defendant's knowledge

6

about the law at all, if it proves that he knows the

7

facts that make the conduct unlawful.

8

objecting to is the government's alternative route to

9

showing mens rea.

And so what we're

And we agree with them up to the

10

point of the fact that they think that it's enough to

11

show that the defendant knew it was violating some State

12

law or perhaps some provision of the FDA which regulates

13

substances independent of the Controlled Substances Act.

14

As a practical matter, in most cases, what

15

the government ­­ the proof is going to be what the

16

government described, which is simply that the defendant

17

engaged in some furtive conduct that suggests that he

18

knows that the substance is illegal.

19

And unless the ­­ the defendant comes

20

forward with some reason for the jury to think that, in

21

fact, he had in mind that it violated some other law, or

22

in fact, that he looked and ­­ and came to the

conclusion it doesn't violate this Controlled Substances

Act, then the jury is very likely to find mens rea
