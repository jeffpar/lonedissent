ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. KELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Messages on Texas license plates are

government speech.

14

onto each license plate and Texas law gives the State

15

sole control and final approval authority over

16

everything that appears on a license plate.

speech rights.

19

20

sticker right next to a license plate, or a car­size

21

paint job or a window decal.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Mr. Keller, one of

play, as long as the State says, hey, look, we're going

anything offensive out of this expressive forum.

20

does create the possibility that in this new world with

all these new kinds of expressive fora, the State will

have a much greater control over its citizens' speech

provide that the board can deny a license plate for

a very different case from the typical forum cases

MR. GEORGE:

Well, the reason is that we do

have hybrid speech and they opened up, and they created

5

this billboard, as Justice Alito said, they created a

6

billboard opportunity.

7

make everybody have a license plate, they said we're

going to create a billboard opportunity and put

13

or you are ­­ you want to say Mighty fine burgers

14

15

That's what they've done.

And

That sort of arbitrary control of speech

16

based upon a standard that it might offend anybody is

17

they either need to get rid of the program, or they need

to open up the program just to everybody else.

act of the State.

Is there a First Amendment standard

MR. KELLER:

I believe it would be

8

government speech and therefore there would not be a

9

First Amendment problem.

10

But I believe it would not be

allowed because other constitutional bars would apply.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. KELLER:

No First Amendment.
Just as if a monument were put

13

up in a public park on par with a candidates speech it

14

would be the government speaking, however, it would

15

not be allowed under other constitutional provisions.

23

Texas wants to prevent

offensiveness and vulgar speech and wants to prevent

confusion and misrepresentation, promote safety, it

3

wants to celebrate the diverse interests that the State

has.

5

Justice Sotomayor, you're absolutely right

6

that even if this is hybrid speech and it does take two

7

to tango in this situation, you need both the motorist

8

and the State propagating the message that that is still

9

government speech.

All the ­­ all of this Court's cases

For one clarificatory matter, all of our

12

cites in our reply brief and our opening brief to Title

13

43 of the Texas Administrative Code, those have been

14

renumbered since the filing of our reply brief, but the

15

substance is all the same.

16

And at base, this is not just about Texas

making money, although Texas does make money.
