ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN URBANSKI

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. URBANSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

10

The California Supreme Court's harmlessness

11

determination was an adjudication on the merits because

12

it denied relief on the basis of the intrinsic rights

13

and wrongs of Mr. Ayala's claim.

14

A Federal habeas court is authorized to set

15

aside that final State judgment only if Ayala can show

16

two things.

17

Court's clearly established laws; and second, actual

18

prejudice under Brecht.

19

First, a legal error as a matter of this

As to the first point, the Ninth Circuit

20

took the view here that there was no adjudication on the

21

merits, and it proceeded to review the entirety of Mr.

22

Ayala's claim under the de novo ­­

I don't know that there's a dispute ­­ or at

2

3

the deference here was given to the harmless error

But I think that that doesn't solve
There's an adjudication

the harmlessness prong, and then there's the substantive

2

violation prong, whether a Batson violation occurred.

3

And what the court here said was if a Batson violation

4

occurred, it doesn't matter.

5

It would be harmless.

So if you ­­ for whatever reason, right or

6

wrong ­­ if you take that harmlessness determination out

7

of the picture, if you say that that was an unreasonable

8

application of law, all right, we're left with

9

essentially a vacuum; right?

10

And so what happens?

What does the court do

where there's been no finding as to a Bat ­­ Batson

violation?

violation and ­­ and go with that.

presented, the State court has ultimately denied relief.

It simply did so on harmless error grounds.

No, your Honor, because

4

the ­­ what this Court also said in Richter is that you

5

look to the ­­ the decision of the claim as a whole.

6

You do not parse it into its components.

7

And here the decision on the claim as a

8

whole was that no relief was warranted because any error

9

did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation

10

such that the Defendant suffered sufficient harm to

11

grant relief.

12
13

So that is the decision that the ­­ that
resolves the claim, and that's ­­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why do we apply AEDPA at

15

all?

16

Brecht's actual prejudice standard is higher than the ­­

17

the AEDPA standard.

18

MS. URBANSKI:

Meaning ­­ I think we've said repeatedly that

So why are we applying it at all?
Your Honor, if ­­ if the

19

Court were to proceed directly to the question of

20

prejudice, then yes, Brecht would be the standard that

21

applies.

22

However, before you even get to that

23

question, the Court should look to what the State court

24

did here first and determine whether that was

25

reasonable.

If it was unreasonable or if there was no

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

adjudication on the merits to begin with, then you reach

2

the second question.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you've ­­ you've

4

already admitted there's sort of an illogic when the

5

State court says there was a Federal violation but no

6

harmlessness and we say, "Yes, there was harm."

7

MS. URBANSKI:

8

think there's an illogic.

9

rule is all the more logical when you look to the facts,

No, your Honor.

I don't

I actually think that the

10

if there is a decision denying relief, and that is the

11

decision that is owed deference under AEDPA standard and

12

that is ­­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we don't give it

14

deference that there was a Federal error.

15

it was a reasonable mistake but they found error and we

16

accept the error.

17

MS. URBANSKI:

We don't say

Correct, Your Honor, because

18

the ­­ what the State court may have thought about the

19

underlying issue on de novo review is not controlling

20

for purposes of AEDPA.

21

That is a different standard.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, would that ­­ would

22

that also apply ­­ I'm just sort of trying to figure out

23

the reach of this claim.

24
25

Just take a case where there was no
harmlessness determination.

There was just a single

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

decision about a Batson claim, but it was an egregious

2

decision.

3

Batson claims, something like that, egregiously wrong.

4

But I guess under your theory, we just look

5

to the judgment and then we decide, there is a credible

6

way in which to say that this Batson claim was not a

7

good one and that we should defer to that; is that

8

right?

9

It was, Hispanics aren't entitled to make

MS. URBANSKI:

That's correct, Your Honor.

10

If there is a denial of relief, then that is all the

11

Federal habeas court needs to look to and then look

12

backwards and ask whether there was a reasonable basis

13

to support it, and that follows directly from this

14

Court's decisions in Richter and Williams.

15

There is no principled way to distinguish

16

between where a State court does precisely that in

17

silence and where the State court does it with a

18

reasoned decision.

Correct, Your Honor.

And

11

those decisions, I would agree, cannot be reconciled

12

with this Court's later decisions in Richter and in Tara

14

do we do when the State court says nothing at all?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MS. URBANSKI:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, first

2

of all, with respect to the standard that is to be

3

applied in this case, the ­­ this Court did make clear

4

that it is the actual prejudice standard of Brecht that

5

is to apply in virtually all 2254 cases, and that is to

6

be the case regardless of whether the State court

7

conducted a Chapman analysis.

8
9

What the Ninth Circuit did here was take
this Court's language and say that it could apply the

10

Brecht standard without regard for the State court's

11

very careful analysis in this case.

12

Fry makes clear, though, that in order to

13

give effect

14

availability of this extraordinary remedy and preserving

15

the finality of State court judgments, the Brecht

16

standard, properly understood and applied, is to be the

17

most protective of final State court judgments .

It is

18

more protective than the AEDPA Chapman standard.

subsumes that standard.

20

to AEDPA's purpose in limiting the

So what we were ask ­­ asking this Court to

21

clarify in this case with respect to how a Federal

22

habeas court is to apply the Brecht standard is that in

23

a case such as this one, where the State court has, in

24

fact, conducted a Chapman analysis and found an error to

25

be harmless, then the Federal court has to be able to

15
Alderson Reporting Company

fairly say that the State court's Chapman analysis was

2

unreasonable.

3

If the Court cannot find the Chapman

4

analysis objectively unreasonable, then the prejudice

inquiry is at an end.

that somehow a prosecutor basing his reasoning on that,

the Ninth Circuit, at least with this juror ­­ I'm not

12

juror ­­ as I pointed out earlier, pointed out two

13

situations that were almost identical to the one that

the op ­­ the prosecutor pointed to with this juror.

15

Anna L. also said something that was totally

16

nonresponsive to a question; it was like, "that's

correct," rather than answering the question.

18

So you can say with complete confidence that

19

that would never have made a difference to the judge?

20

If he had had a real adversary able to point all of

these things out, you're confident the judge would not

have made up his mind.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY J. DAIN

10

Thank you, counsel.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DAIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Let me start by answering the question that

11

Justice Scalia, Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan

12

asked when this first began.

13

was an adjudication on the merits, based on the

14

harmlessness determination.

15

to address the first prong in the first instance, is

16

because it wants to create the fiction that by treating

17

this holistically, the California Supreme Court actually

18

found no Federal error, and that is what this Court must

19

grant deference to.

20

And, that is, yes, this

The reason the State wants

So let's start with the second question.

21

The second question is the question at heart:

22

Brecht applied appropriately?

23

in the ­­ the general context, if there was an

24

unreasonable determination of Chapman by the State

25

Supreme Court.

Was

And we only get to that

And the Ninth Circuit said, we grant

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

deference on that point to the California Supreme Court.

2

I'll address Olanders D., but let me even

3

show you why this is case closed in an overarching

4

pretext by the prosecutor, that led to all the harm in

5

this case.

6

When the trial court asked the prosecutor to

7

State his race­neutral reasons, the first words out of

8

the prosecutor's mar ­­ mouth, were pretext, active

9

pretext, using a shield as a sword.

10

The prosecutor said, and I quote, We can do

11

that but we will do it in chambers, because they have no

12

right ­­ the defense ­­ to our strategy.

13

pretext.

14

That was

The prosecutor was stating on an overarching

15

level for Olanders D., Galileo S. ­­ or Galileo,

16

Barbara S., Gerardo O., and the others, that his primary

17

reason for challenge was strategy.

18

pretext.

19

much ­­ must give great deference to because it

20

conducted credibility determinations, didn't question

21

that.

22

because defense counsel responded:

23

to be present, to hear that statement, in case the

24

prosecution is misstating the facts.

25

And that was

The trial court, which the State says we

Defense counsel was primed to question that

But we have a right

2

have this in camera, but why was the statement that we

3

don't want to disclose our strategy a statement that ­­

4

that challenges that ­­ that the challenges that I'm

5

going to make are going to be pretextual?

6

MR. DAIN:

Maybe it was wrong to

Because when the prosecution

7

said, I'll give you my reasons, but I don't want my

8

adversary ­­ I don't want my adversary to be present to

9

test this in the crucible of an adversarial situation,

10

which is what the Constitution requires.

11

my reasons for challenging these jurors involves

12

strategy, it's a pretext.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

When he says,

It did not involve strategy.
I don't understand that.

14

When you ­­ when you're trying a case and you're

15

deciding which jurors to exercise peremptory challenges

16

against, do you not take into account what your defense

17

is going to be?

18

is going to be.

19

MR. DAIN:

What your defense strategy in the case

You might ­­ you might, but from

20

Georgia v. McCollom to ­­ in this case, the State court

21

analyzed it under its own State law equivalent.

22

Strategy is not why you would say I don't like this

23

person or I don't trust this person, he doesn't dress

24

right, he doesn't fit in.

25

those are reasons for which the defense counsel can,

The courts have said all of

28
Alderson Reporting Company

should participate and respond.
Strategy involves a much more deep analysis

3

that is very rare as this Court has said in prior cases.

4

It's in the rare instance.

5

a general argument that everything I do is strategy, but

6

the prosecutor was saying it involves strategy which is

7

a very rare situation.

8

9

statements involved strategy.

10

It's very rare.

This isn't

And in none of ­­ as the

So at a minimum, the State says we must

11

credit and give deference to not only the trial court,

12

but the California Supreme Court's credibility

13

determinations.

14

found, in determining error that it was not credible,

15

that we ­­ that strategy was not involved, then a

16

credibility determination was not made.

17

furthermore, the trial court missed that.

18

counsel said, I don't want to be involved in their

19

strategy, but I want to hear the statement because I

20

want to be present to tell you it's a misstatement.

21

Why have we instruct our ­­

But the California

10

More importantly, it specifically, in opposition to

11

Chief Justice George in dissent, said that the

12

strategy ­­ that ­­ that the lack of strategy was error.

13

What it didn't recognize ­­ and this is why there was an

14

unreasonable application of Chapman.

example.

The answer to your question is, no, that's

not a trial strategy in the context of the cases.

11

Everything's a strategy.

12

strategy is what order I'm going to call the witnesses

13

in.

14

How ­­ you could argue

The reason it's not a strategy, and

certainly not a reason for an ex parte communication, is

16

defense counsel would already know that.

17

would have been listed; discovery would have been given.

18

MR. DAIN:

MR. DAIN:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.
Either way.

We would be

3

speculating if defense attorney remained silent, or we'd

4

be speculating that the judge would have ruled the same

5

way. The question is on this record.

6

MR. DAIN:

Had he ruled the same way ­­ had

7

defense counsel participated and he ruled the same way,

8

we would have a Batson challenge in substance, not, as

9

Your Honor has recognized, a procedural issue.

At that

10

point, all this Court has said, all we can do is say

11

would it have likely changed the outcome, we can't

12

speculate either way.

13

that caused that and that's the prejudice.

14

caused the inability to have a complete record,

15

actually, in two ways, it also lost, inadvertently in

16

that instance, it lost the Miller­El v. Dretke

17

opportunity through the questionnaires.

18

But the problem is it's the State
The State

But the State actively caused the exclusion

19

of defendant, it caused the inability to have a complete

address your question, Justice Kennedy.

The Ninth

said that.
MR. DAIN:

I'm sorry, but the Ninth Circuit

20

pointed out the trial court said that.

21

Olanders D is so compelling is because the trial court

22

itself questioned some of the prosecutor's reasons, but

23

there were others.

24
25

So the reason

For instance, the prosecutor said the
questionnaire indicated he opposed the death penalty.

MR. DAIN:

And that's what our argument ­­

14

you can even take the existing record and show the

15

inconsistencies that show Chapman was not appropriately

16

applied.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Of course it's speculative

18

that defense counsel, had defense counsel been present,

19

would have been able to point to the other juror, Anna.

20

We've had a number of cases where defense counsel was

21

present at the voir dire, which I think should be the

22

rule in almost every situation, and only later, years

23

later on appeal when ­­ as particularly when you have

24

many, many jurors questioned, as apparently was the case

25

here, does somebody realize, well, this juror who was

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

dismissed, has answers seem to be somewhat similar to

2

this other juror who ­­ who wasn't challenged.

3

MR. DAIN:

And then had that been the facts,

4

we lose, under AEDPA, we lose.

5

give deference under AEDPA to the California Supreme

6

Court.

7

Because you do have to

I agree.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what reason is there to

8

think that defense counsel would have had better recall

9

of this than the trial judge who was there?

10

MR. DAIN:

Defense counsel ­­ first of all,

11

there were two of them.

12

focused on each of the jurors that were excused.

13

judge had ­­ as the Ninth Circuit noted, there were 70

14

questions for each of these questionnaires, they

15

involved 17 pages.

16

have had his own notes that he thought were important,

17

they may have been complete or not incomplete.

18

certainly has many more tasks that don't involve just

19

the direct advocacy, as defense counsel has.

20

when I add, it's the prosecution, the State that caused

21

that.

22

speculating.

23

First of all, they're more

But that's

And then uses its sword to say, well, now you're

We can do nothing more.

But with Olanders D

24

on the existing record, we can show that was wrong.

25

reason I'm saying it was unreasonable is because the

40
Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official

1

Court should have taken into account in prejudice that

2

there is a lack of credibility when a prosecutor comes

3

in and causes all these problems and the State Supreme

4

Court says, and that wasn't correct.

5

strategy involved here.

6

Courts use the term "strategy" and "confidential

7

information."

8

where you have informants, they're used where you have

9

gang activity, very rare circumstances that occurs.

10

There was no

By the way, they use ­­ the

Those are generally tied.

They're used

But how ­­ even if you said under Richter,

11

how can any reasonable judge or justice disagree that if

12

the State, through a false basis, excluded defense

13

counsel, eliminated defense counsel from challenging the

14

questions and assisting the judge where the judge didn't

15

recognize that ­­ that strategy was not involved,

16

prevented further voir dire which might have corrected

17

the situation, prevented a proper record and then later

18

lost all of the ability to do a comparative analysis,

19

could be harmless, I'm ­­ and let me even use in the

20

Brecht standard, this Court has eloquently said that ­­

21

and if you'll give me a moment of unprofessionality

22

while I shuffle my pages ­­ but this Court has said that

23

it undermines the very integrity of the court system.

24

And in McCollom, it actually described that

25

it ­­ it may be obvious to the jury, it undermines the

41

1

parties' understanding and the Court's ability to ­­ to

2

maintain integrity through the entire trial.

3

Brecht, this error caused injury to the jury verdict.

4

And, moreover, the questionnaires are lost, even Brecht

5

can't address that, because they were lost post verdict.

6

So under

But under any standard, there was an

7

unreasonable application of Chapman by the State Supreme

8

Court and it had actual prejudice in this case.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBIN URBANSKI
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

10

MS. URBANSKI:

11

Just a few brief points.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice:
First of all, with

12

respect to the prosecutor stating that he believes he

13

would reveal trial strategy, there is no reason to think

14

that that was any kind of a pretext for then exercising

15

peremptory challenges on the basis of race.

16

court never found this prosecutor to be anything less

17

than credible, and that determination is entitled to

18

great deference in a Federal habeas collateral

19

proceeding.

20

With respect to Olanders ­­

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22
23

The trial

What was the trial strategy

that displayed itself in his strikes?
MS. URBANSKI:

I cannot tell the Court what

24

it was, but I don't think there is any reason to take

25

the trial ­­ the prosecutor at anything less than his

44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

word.

2

it.

3

it is also not a reason to suggest that this was a

4

pretext for race.

We don't have anything in the record to refute

5

Certainly that is not what ended up happening, but

With respect to Olanders D, this juror gave

6

responses that were not only not responsive, but they

7

were responses that would cause any prosecutor to have

8

doubt about that particular juror serving on a capital

9

case.

10

There were clearly grounds for the prosecutor to

have wanted to excuse that juror.

11

But most importantly, the California Supreme

12

Court looked at this record and it found support for the

13

assertions in the record; with respect to Olanders D.,

14

that appears at Petition Appendix page 203a.

15

What we have here is the Ninth Circuit

16

substituting its own view without ever showing how the

17

State court was objectively unreasonable in its

18

analysis.

19

very same harmlessness question under a much higher

20

standard, the Chapman standard, and found no harm.

21

to proceed without regard for the State court's very

22

careful determination in that regard seems antithetical

23

to the spirit of AEDPA.
