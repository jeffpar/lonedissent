Local governments violate the in­writing

requirement of Section 332 when they fail to issue a

document separate from the administrative record that

construct a personal wireless facility.

16

construction would flout the very purpose of this

provision, which is to enable meaningful judicial

Mr. Fisher, you're deriving

all this from the word "decision" and "decision" as even

14

It can mean an opinion or it can mean a

So why should we interpret it your

MR. FISHER:

For two reasons, Justice Kagan.

15

One is because the overall context of the Act and the

16

substantial evidence review requirement and the overall

17

purpose tell us that "decision" needs to specify

18

reasons.

19

until you know what the reasons are.

20

You can't conduct substantial evidence review

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that only suggests

21

that you need reasons.

22

reasons have to appear in a decision as opposed to some

23

other document.

MR. FISHER:

It doesn't suggest that the

Fair enough.

So one other part

of the Act, which is the expedited review provision, I

think, also is instructive.

in mind was that parties could show up in a district

3

court and go straight to the question whether evidence

4

in the record supported the city's decision.

5

did not contemplate what we would have under the City's

6

approach or even the Solicitor General's approach, which

7

is an entire first phase of litigation devoted to

8

figuring out what those reasons are.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

The idea that Congress had

But the larger problem

10

here, of course, is that under your view, the Federal

serious concern under Federalism.

And I think there we're going

8

to have to have one of these prolonged proceedings to

The

10

city has already filed one brief in the district court,

11

before this case started to go up on appeal, where it

took the position that there were three reasons for its

denial:

question Congress contemplated, which is substantial

MR. CAROTHERS:
a multi­tiered question.

Well, Justice Alito, that is
Let me see if I can answer it.

5

Number one, the amicus brief that was filed

6

on behalf of the City of Roswell basically lays out the

7

fact that you are exactly correct, there are lots of

8

municipalities and local governments throughout this

9

country that have trouble dealing with a pretty

10

sophisticated Federal statute.

11

a relative degree of sophistication, it has attorneys,

12

and it has planners and can do that.

13

The City of Roswell has

But no court has ever held, including this

14

Court, that the Chenery­type analysis for what needs to

15

be an administrative decision has an application to a

16

local government.

17

that ­­ there is lots of argument from Petitioner that

18

there's something wrong with what Roswell did.

19

you just look at, specifically, they had evidence in the

20

record, they had people who said this, this, this, this,

21

and this.

22

said aesthetics, not right for the area, diminution of

23

property value, and the other one ­­

24
25

If you look, for instance, that ­­

And if

You had four council members, three of whom

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Carothers, I wonder

whether what Justice Alito pointed out about the nature

45
Alderson Reporting Company

of local governments, which you agreed with, whether

2

that doesn't suggest that we should try to keep our rule

3

quite simple.

4

small local governments has access to great lawyers or

5

knows a lot about communication, that we should just set

6

up a rule that enables them to comply simply.

7

And that rule, honestly, would be

In other words, given that nobody in

8

9

It would just say, in your decision,
Because otherwise,

10

if we don't have that rule and every judge has to look

11

through the minutes and the transcript and anything else

12

in the record to decide whether a reason is clear

13

enough, there are going to be a lot of local governments

14

that are going to get kind of caught, and the judge is

15

going to say, I'm sorry, it's not clear enough, even

16

though if the government had spent just five minutes, it

17

could have made it clear enough.

18

just say, do that so that you don't get caught.

19

MR. CAROTHERS:

And maybe we should

Well, Justice Kagan, I ­­ I

20

don't object to that as long as the minutes are the

21

final decision and so the 30 days can run from there.

22

But then you're going to have that decision that's not

23

going to come out for a couple months until the city

24

attorneys and the planners have time to digest the

25

decision of the record in orders to formulate that.

46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And I will suggest to the Court that if, in

2

fact, that occurs, it starts the process over because

3

then the challenge is going to be the statements in the

4

letter do not accurately reflect the minutes, they

5

misstate the minutes, they mischaracterize the minutes.

6

In fact, they're a post hoc rationalization of what was

7

in the minutes.

8

of inquiry and challenge which could be avoided if we

9

simply waited for the letter and approve the minutes ­­

10

We are going to have yet another line

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that inquiry and

11

challenge will be left up to judges to figure out what

12

the minutes say, don't say, and what the reasons were.

13

MR. CAROTHERS:

Well, Justice Sotomayor,

14

as ­­ as I read the jurisprudence, the fact is the

15

substantial evidence in a written record and to see the

16

reasons is pretty much left up to the district court.

14

that does not have some form of minutes or ratification

15

of the previous actions and discussions they've taken,

16

which are generally approved at the next meeting.

17

I don't know of a jurisdiction

I think, in fact, if they're going to have

18

substantial evidence in the written record, whenever

19

those minutes are approved, they had better get into

doing minutes because that is what's going to be

the reasons that we have denied and therefore we do deny

upon the substantial record.

I don't see that that,

10

whether it's a denial, whether it's a notification,

11

whatever it is, it doesn't have to have reasons.

12

really, it doesn't help the applicant and doesn't help

13

the city, but we're trying to give the words in the

14

statute some effect.

15

effect that it is a decision and glorify something

16

because a decision can be no.

17

So

We do not want to give them the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Everybody else like you

18

thinks that there has to be a denial letter, right?

19

Is ­­ is that a unique perception that ­­ that you have

20

come to, or is it generally thought that you have to

21

have a denial letter?

22

MR. CAROTHERS:

I think ­­ I think there is

23

a perception, because of what the statute says, that

24

there has to be a denial letter, but it doesn't have to

25

have reasons.

And if you don't have the reasons in the

start the appeal time running for the 30 days.

Did you take that position

MR. CAROTHERS:

Justice Kennedy, I'm

struggling to answer that question because we didn't get

very far in the district court.

chance to talk about substantial evidence because the

9

court decided:

We never really got a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

Mr. Fisher, you have 4 minutes remaining.

14

Thank you, counsel.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16

MR. FISHER:

Thank you.

I would like to

17

make a point about our rule and then turn to the

18

practicalities.

19

First, to ­­ to ­­ I think that what came

20

before me helped under ­­ helped explain why a separate

21

letter specifying the reasons for denial is not only

22

required by the statute, but is the only way to make it

23

work.

24
25

If you look at the minutes that the city
issued here, and they're in the back of the Joint

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Appendix ­­ remember, as I think it's been noted, cities

2

don't have to issue minutes, and so you're not always

3

going to have minutes.

4

minutes here would have been enough, look at the

5

minutes, and if you want to look later at J.A. 338,

6

J.A. 336, and J.A. 340, there are some of the reasons,

7

as the Solicitor General put it, potential reasons,

8

offered by various council members before the vote.

But on the theory that the

9

But if you look at J.A. 340, you'll see that

10

all of those are separated from the motion, so the

11

motion doesn't incorporate any of the reasons, not even

12

what Dr. Price said before she made her motion.

13

So imagine yourself a district judge getting

14

this set of minutes.

15

reasons were for denying the permit, and that's the

16

problem that T­Mobile has and that's the problem the

17

district judges

18

You don't know what the city's

have.

And I want to turn to Justice Alito's

19

question ­­ and, Justice Kennedy, I think you also asked

20

about the Federalism implications for local governments.

21

First of all, let me start with the City of

22

Roswell.

23

J.A. 84, requires it to give a separate document with

24

reasons if it denies an application to construct a cell

25

site on city­owned property.

The City of Roswell's own code, and this is at

All we're asking the city

55
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

to do is do what it already does with respect to

2

applications for city­owned property.

3

Now, you also point out there are rural

4

areas in the country that have smaller staffs and

5

jurisdictions.

6

cite statutes from other States like New Hampshire,

7

Nevada, Idaho, that already have as a matter of State

8

law the rule that we pronounce ­­ I'm sorry, the rule

9

that we propose.

At ­­ at page 13 of our reply brief we

The rural jurisdictions in those

10

States don't seem to have difficulty doing it, and I

11

think the reason why is because, as has been said a few

12

times today, it just requires a few sentences usually.

13

Just tell us what the reasons are and tell the district

14

court what the reasons are, so that when we get into

15

court we can have the streamlined proceeding that

16

Congress imagined, and that it can be done, as the

17

statute itself requires, on an expedited basis.

18

That's all we're asking for today, and we

19

think that any other rule is going to create problems at

20

the lower ­­ I'm sorry, before you ever get to court and

21

even more problems once we get to court.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Fisher, suppose that I

23

think that you're right about that, but then the

24

question is did Congress require that.

25

that the SG is really saying, no, Congress required

56
Alderson Reporting Company

And I take it

Official

1

reasons, it required that by saying that there was

2

substantial evidence review, but that it didn't require

3

the reasons to be in any particular form, and, indeed,

4

there's a savings clause which says that all doubts go

5

to the State and local governments in this area.

6

notwithstanding that this is going to actually get State

7

and local governments into some trouble, and

8

notwithstanding that district courts are going to

9

struggle with it, we should go with the SG's rule rather

10
11
12

So

than with yours.
MR. FISHER:

We think the best reading of

sub (iii) is that Congress actually did require this.

13

As the city itself pointed out, it separates

14

the notion of a decision in writing from whether it has

15

substantial evidence in the record that supports it.

16

when you ask what the decision in writing is, you

17

need ­­ we think the best reading of that is that's the

18

reasons.

19

substantial evidence, and you can't ask the substantial

20

evidence question until you know what the reasons are.

21

So

The reasons have to be supported by

And I think also, for the other reasons that

22

we've pointed out and the Chamber of Commerce pointed

23

out, how the Communications Act uses the word "decision"

24

in a particular way.

25

other statutes to signify that an explanation is ­­ is

It uses the word "decision" in

57
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

something embedded in that, not as ­­ as ­­ as is often

2

the case, and the city itself characterized the denial

3

letter today, I think aptly, as a notification.

4

Well, the Communications Act uses the words

5

"notify" and "notification" to refer to other kinds of

6

advisements that need to be given.

7

Congress chose here.

8
9

That's not the word

So, Justice Kagan, I agree, but if you look
at this statute you might wonder to yourself if you

10

misread the words in a vacuum which are ­­ which rule

11

comes out of it, ours or the SG's.

12

But we know from City of Arlington, as this

13

Court said, that the limitations in sub (iii) are

14

limitations that Congress did intend to impose and the

15

best reading of those limitations are the ones that we

16

have given.
