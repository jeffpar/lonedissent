ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Court:
Florida punished the candidate seeking

11

election to judicial office because she signed form

12

letters and a Web posting soliciting contributions to

13

her campaign committee, contributions that were

14

completely lawful under Florida law.

15

Amendment bars Florida from prohibiting that speech.

16

The First

The threshold question, of course, is what

17

standard of review.

18

applies, the standard that was applied by the court

19

below, for several reasons.

20

obviously a content­based restriction.

21

content of the speech, does it solicit a campaign

22

contribution.

We submit that strict scrutiny

First of all, this is
It turns on the

24

McConnell to justify applying the closely drawn scrutiny

25

standard that has sometimes been applied to campaign

contribution limitations.

2

for several reasons.

3

That standard does not apply

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Pincus, whatever the

4

standard, suppose the Florida rule was simply no

5

face­to­face solicitations.

That's it.

6

Would you concede that that would be a valid

7

regulation or would that fall under the First Amendment

8

as well?

9

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I certainly would concede

10

it in this case, Your Honor, because my client did not

11

engage in any face­to­face solicitation.

12

eliminate the sanctions against her.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that would

I want to understand your

14

view of the scope of the First Amendment in relation to

15

the selection of ­­ the election of judges.

16

MR. PINCUS:

I think a state could adopt a

17

prophylactic rule prohibiting face­to­face solicitation,

18

certainly one­on­one solicitation and perhaps as some

19

states have done solicitations in larger groups.

20

There might be some applications of that

21

rule that were ­­ that made that rule invalid as

22

applied, for example, a face­to­face solicitation of

23

one's relatives that have nothing to do with the

24

judicial system in the state at issue.

25

First Amendment would certainly allow the adoption of

4
Alderson Reporting Company

But I think the

Official

1

that sort of rule.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the First Amendment

3

would not allow that for the candidate for political

4

office.

5

MR. PINCUS:

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Exactly.
So you are making it ­­

7

you are recognizing that there's a difference between

8

judicial office ­­ that the First Amendment allows the

9

State to do things with respect to the election of

10

judges that it wouldn't allow them to do with respect to

11

the election of members of the legislature.

12

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I guess I would amend my

13

answer to say that ­­ that the First Amendment might

14

allow a ban on some solicitations on a coercion theory.

15

Let me step back.

16

that have been advanced in this case to justify the

17

rule.

18

There are three government interests

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yeah, but I just asked

19

you ­­

20

that that answer was ill considered?

21

face­to­face solicitation by candidates for judicial

22

office, good or not?

23

the same standard as a ban on face­to­face solicitation

24

by political ­­ candidates

25

you gave me an answer and now are you telling me

MR. PINCUS:

That is, a ban on

And it ­­ would it be judged by

I think it would be judged by

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the same strict scrutiny standard, but I think the

2

interests that the government could advance in support

3

of that restriction in the judicial context, one of them

4

doesn't exist in the legislative context, the interest

5

in preventing bias or in preserving impartiality.

6

one, the interest in preventing coercion of the person

7

solicited, I think, applies somewhat differently in the

8

legislative context than it does in the judicial

9

context.

And

So I don't want to say that there's no ban on

10

solicitation that would be permissible in the

11

non­judicial context.

12

bans Congress from soliciting ­­ members of Congress

13

from soliciting Federal employees, for example.

14

There is a federal statute that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But if you had the statute

15

that you say would be valid barring face­to­face

16

discrimination, then you have all sorts of gradations.

17

What about a personal one­on­one letter?

18

different?

19

well, this is what, I guess, under ­­ under­inclusive.

20

And then if we say, well, the one­on­one letter, that's

21

almost like a personal solicitation, we can ban that,

22

then what about a letter to five people?

23

off to the races.

24

MR. PINCUS:

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How is that

I can just see the Court having to say,

And then we're

I think ­­
It seems to me when you

Alderson Reporting Company

1

make the initial concession, you have a real problem in

2

determining how to make this not over­ or

3

under­inclusive.

I don't think so, Justice

7

and oral communications.

9

distinction.

So I think there is a reasonable

10

distinction that it says whatever the rule might be,

written communications are fundamentally different if

12

the interest that the government is asserting is

13

coercion.

And I ­­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, which is it?

You know, if we meet somewhere and I take out a tablet

16

and write something down and hand it to you.

17

It's at least not oral.

MR. PINCUS:

I guess I would say "in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. PINCUS:

In person.

I think the question here ­­

22

again, just to back up for a minute, is in ­­ I think in

23

all of the contexts that we're talking about here, the

24

interest is whether the person solicited is being

25

coerced.

9

MR. PINCUS:

I didn't, sorry, Your Honor.
Oh, it's your fault.

There are three interests.

One, the interest in promoting impartiality/preventing

I mean, there's stuff we

18

don't let judges do that we let other people do.

20

it's in any ethical rules, but let's assume it was in

21

ethical rules ­­ that judges do not respond in op ed

pieces to criticisms of their decisions.

John Marshall did that but he did it anonymously.

So it

that interest doesn't apply for several reasons ­­ first

5

you think you can have different rules for judicial

6

elections than you can have for political elections.

brief, that they had a horrendous problem with

corruption and they wanted to get a handle on it.

they made this small step.

MR. PINCUS:

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

13

MR. PINCUS:

Well ­­
And they ­­
To answer your question,

14

Justice Ginsburg, yes, there can be different rules.

15

Because two of the interests that I mentioned, the

16

interest in preventing impartiality and the interest in

17

preventing coercion, apply differently in the judicial

18

context.

19

Florida prohibit in­person, one­to­one solicitations or

20

in­person solicitations to a group of some size as

21

states have done, yes, I think they could do that and I

22

don't think that could be done for legislative or

23

executive branch candidates.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

So I do think that in your hypothetical could

Suppose a state's view is

we want the ­­ our judiciary to be above the political

fray so we have this kind of restriction on putting

2

themselves forward as ­­ as the solicitor.

3

MR. PINCUS:

Well, a couple of answers, Your

4

Honor.

5

interest is the state has adopted an election system

6

that puts judges in the political fray.

7

said in its opinion in White, some things necessarily

8

come with the fact that a state has made the choice to

9

choose judges via election and that includes the fact of

I think the problem with a state having that

So as the Court

10

an election and some First Amendment requirements that

11

apply to election­related speech.

12

problem with making that decision.

So I think that's the

13

A second problem is the particular scheme

14

that Florida has adopted here, which as I said, does

15

allow the judge involvement in the contribution system.

16

The judge can know who solicited, can know who gives and

17

can write thank you notes.

18

decisions, the decision to prohibit ­­

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So once Florida makes those

Well, how can the judge

20

not know?

21

the judge supposed to not read the disclosure list?

22

Everybody else does, he doesn't?

23

Especially if some states want disclosure, is

MR. PINCUS:

Well, there are some states

24

that prohibit the judge from finding out who ­­ who

25

knows; Minnesota, for example, has that prohibition.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

that ­­ that's just unworkable.

Court could conclude, as ­­ as the Eighth Circuit did,

20

that in Minnesota, a state like that, where the judge

21

doesn't know, there is even less of a ­­ of a reason to

prohibit solicitations because the judge isn't going to

you think, but I can actually see how receiving a signed

letter from the judge saying, give, and ­­ or a

communications and oral communications, either

intertwining of substantive messages and requests for

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think there are a

Mr. Pincus, I take it it

4

follows a fortiori, from what you're saying, that the

5

Federal canon that applies to us is unconstitutional, at

6

least as respects to written communications, so we're

7

not allowed to put our name on fund­raising materials

8

and things like that.

9

too, that's got to go as well; is that right?

10

MR. PINCUS:

I take it you're saying that,

No, I don't think so, Your

11

Honor.

12

Scalia, I think the leeway that the Federal government

13

and the States have to regulate the judges and other

14

employees because of inconsistency with their duties

15

this Court has said is much broader than it is and

16

meets ­­ does not have to satisfy the compelling

17

interest test as this particular restriction does.

don't think it at all follows.

can be restricted.

13

I take it from your answer and in applying

MR. PINCUS:

No, I don't think so, Your

14

Honor, because I think this is speech in a different

15

category any ­­ any more than the government can say,

16

we're going to use Pickering to respect the solicitation

17

speech of a sitting congressman or State legislature.

18

I think it is the election context and the

19

fact that the State has chosen to choose its judges via

20

election that triggers the protections ­­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, you know, I would

22

think ­­ I would think it's ­­ it's just the opposite,

23

right, that in a case for Federal judges ­­ like you

24

say, there's not really much of an interest.

25

whether I solicit funds on behalf of my old law school.

21
Alderson Reporting Company

Who cares

Official

1

It doesn't have anything to do with what rulings I'm

2

going to issue, who I'm going to favor, who I'm not

3

going to favor.

4

In this case, the State can really come in

5

and say, you know, the things that we're objecting to,

6

the solicitations that we're preventing are exactly the

7

ones that are going to go to whether this judge can be

8

an impartial judge rendering fair verdicts.

9

MR. PINCUS:

I think that's wrong on two

10

counts, Your Honor.

11

the judge can know who contributed and can write a thank

12

you note, the idea that prohibiting the judge to asking

13

contributes in any way ­­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think there is ­­ again, where

MR. PINCUS:

I'm sorry ­­ contributes in any

17

way to the protection of that interest seems

18

inconceivable if the question is, is there bias?

19

What Florida has basically made ­­ made a

20

basic determination that a thousand dollar campaign

21

contribution limit is going to protect our interests

22

against bias.

23

And so the question, then, is:

Are any of

24

these other activities going to create such an

25

appearance?

22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And where the State has said a thank you

2

note, which seems more ­­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

You keep on going back

4

on that.

5

allowable for the State to say, no, that even the

6

chairman can't ­­ can't make those solicitations?

7

you keep on falling back, well, they allowed the

8

chairman or they allowed the thank you notes.

9

But, I mean, do you think it would be

So

So now let's say, you know, the State says,

10

look, we've been trying to do this because we've been

11

trying to narrow the law in order to accommodate First

12

Amendment interests; but if you're going to throw that

13

back in our face, we'll apply it to the campaign chair,

14

too.

15

will also be impermissible.

We'll apply it to thank you notes, too.

16

Would that be constitutional?

17

MR. PINCUS:

Those

I think if the State wanted to

18

adopt a system of public financing for judicial

19

candidates, that it might well then be constitutional

20

for the State to ban solicitations on the McConnell

21

theory.

answer that question because we ­­ we can think about

3

MR. PINCUS:

I think the answer to that

5

question is no, because the contributions are still

6

permissible.

McConnell, in terms of solicitation limitations, was

it's quite permissible to ban candidates from soliciting

contributions that cannot lawfully be made to their

committees when there are other avenues ­­ when they can

12

I think it would be quite a different

situation to say, yes, we're going to have an election,

14

but no one can solicit any money for the campaign

15

committee because, as the Court has said, money is ­­ is

16

essential to get the candidate's message out.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The whole ­­ but the

18

whole effort on Florida's part is to make the selection

19

of judges not like the political context.

20

And you ­­ what you're saying is that

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. RICHARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I'd like to begin by responding to Justice

18

Alito's question.

19

Florida law or in the canons that prohibits a candidate

20

from giving names to the committee for the purpose of

21

the committee soliciting from those individuals.

The answer is that there's nothing in

22

What the Florida canon is designed to do is

23

something that this Court has recognized previously in

24

Buckley and McConnell, which is to cut the direct link

25

that creates the quid pro quo relationship by keeping

25

the judge from communicating, with the judicial

candidate from communicating directly with the person

that he or she desires to receive the funds

think that what we're ­­

from.

That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

I mean, once you say you

can send a thank you note, what ­­ what you've just said
is not true.
MR. RICHARD:

Well, if ­­ if what we focus

12

on, which is what my colleague and opposing counsel

13

focused on, is the intimidation issue, I agree with you.

14

Either the intimidation issue or the effort to curry ­­

15

to ­­ to say you've curried favor, I agree with that.

16

But there's another factor here that this Court has

17

recognized is almost equally, if not equally important,

18

which is the appearance of the quid pro quo and the

19

appearance of corrupt influence that is inherent in the

20

quid pro quo that the ­­ that results in a public loss

21

of confidence in the judicial system.

MR. RICHARD:

But nobody

I think, Your Honor, that what

7

we deal with here, in response to your question, is

8

similar in kind to this issue of how many people are

9

being addressed.

10

This Court has said that in circumstances

11

like this, the Court has no scalpel, to use its words,

12

as to where to draw the line.

13

judicially manageable?

14

The question is what's

And so the question then becomes where

15

there's going to be a line drawn, is it unreasonable for

16

the State to say, we're just going to prohibit it, we're

17

not going to try to micromanage who it is ­­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, there's a

19

difference between micromanaging and overinclusiveness

20

or under­inclusiveness.

21

easily limited to litigants or lawyers appearing before

22

the Court.

23

MR. RICHARD:

I mean, could ­­ this could be

It could be, Your Honor.

But

24

then the question is what the appearance to the public

25

is; and the second question is, because it's always a

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question in First Amendment cases, how does this weigh

2

against the imposition on the candidate's First

3

Amendment rights?

4

This Court has recognized ­­ it did in ­­ in

5

both Buckley and McConnell ­­ that one of the reasons

6

that it upheld it and one of the reasons that it applied

7

a lesser ­­ a lesser standard of review was because it

8

said that the imposition on ­­ on the ­­ on the

9

communicative value of the contributions was marginal.

10

In this case, it's even more marginal.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I ­­ I ­­ be careful

imposition at all.

9

I haven't reached that

But ­­ and I understand it's a high mountain

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Could they ­­ could

10

Florida apply this canon to candidates for political

office?

MR. RICHARD:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You're saying could it?
Yes.

If Florida says, we

14

think it's such a good idea for the judges, we want to

15

make it across the board, no candidate for political

16

office can make a direct appeal for money.

17

MR. RICHARD:

I think it would be far more

18

difficult to convince the Court that that would be

19

constitutional, and here's the reason:

20

what Justice Kennedy has recognized as what he coined

21

the ­­ the good responsiveness and the bad

22

responsiveness.

23

It's because of

In a democratic society, in a republican

24

form of government, candidates in the other two branches

25

are expected to commit themselves in advance to certain

positions and are expected to comply with that once

2

they're elected in order to do what their supporters

3

expected them to do when they supported them with

4

financial contributions and otherwise.

5

When we're talking about judges, there is no

good responsiveness to a supporter or a contributor.

whether or not ­­

MR. RICHARD:

Well, I think that's

solicitation of a quid.

me, because I actually think judges should try to keep

contributions so there is direct contact and the person

JUSTICE BREYER:

One ­­ just one would be

enough, but I want to know what they are.
MR. RICHARD: I understand, but I want to use
every weapon I have in my arsenal.
So the first answer is that at the time that

12

the money is being solicited the contributor, if it is

13

solicited through a third person, doesn't know whether

14

the judge will ever find out.

15

person making the contribution doesn't know whether the

judge will ever find out, whether he's ever going to

receive a thank­you note or not.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to know what the

8

differences are, which is a main point that was argued

indeed, as you've added, in the initial letter you can

11

say, "and I will tell the judge"?

JUSTICE BREYER:

One answer is to say it

does exactly the same, it adds nothing but you don't

3

have to deal with every problem.

4

Do you have any answer that says it does add something?

5

If so, what?

6

MR. RICHARD:

I've got that answer.

I believe that Florida could

7

prohibit the thank you note as well, but it doesn't

8

change the fact ­­ by not prohibiting, it does not

9

undermine the fact that by telling judges that they

10

cannot personally, face­to­face or by buttonhole or by

11

12

significantly the public's impression of the fact that

2

It's possible that if the action rose to the point where

And ­­ and of course the

18

one area where this Court has consistently recognized

19

that the State can validly regulate contributions and

20

solicitations is in its effort to break the direct quid

21

pro quo, the direct communication between the judge

22

requesting the money ­­ in this case a judge as opposed

23

to the ­­ even in the other two branches, the Court has

a judge being able to pick up the telephone or visit any

lawyer who ever appears before him, or for that matter

5

any nonlawyer who might end up appearing before him or

before her, and ask for a contribution, and compare that

7

to a third person saying to a voter or a contributor,

8

"My friend, Joe Smith, is running for judge and I would

would be difficult for anyone who has lived in our

MR. RICHARD:

Well, I would say the greater

damage again goes to the fact that she is personally and

publicly requesting a quid from people who can be

21

expected to appear before her.

22

concern over the public's reaction to that, which I

would suggest is a fair concern and this Court has found

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Richard, there is

something that the other side has said about your

position and I'd like your answer to it, that is that

2

what you are advocating will help the people who are

3

already in the judiciary, the people who have lots of

4

money so they don't need contributions from others, the

5

people who will be hurt are like Ms. Yulee, who is

trying for the first time.

8

incumbents, yes, current officeholders and the rich.

9

MR. RICHARD:

In other words, the Florida

I disagree with that, Your

10

Honor, and I find it curious that the Petitioner would

11

suggest that if we take the restrictions off of

12

incumbent judges so that they're now free to call

13

lawyers who appear before them or litigants who might be

14

appearing before them and ask for money, that that

15

wouldn't give the incumbent an enormous advantage over

16

non­incumbent judges.

It seems to me that it would.

17

But we're also dealing here in an area in

18

which there is no evidence either in the record or in

19

the literature to suggest that it makes any difference

20

and also ­­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm sorry, but

22

you ­­ up to this point you've been saying what a

25

the line there.

MR. RICHARD:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.
It seems to me that

5

it's ­­ it's self­evident, particularly in judicial

6

races, where that the ­­ prohibiting a form of raising

7

funds is to the great advantage of the incumbent because

8

the only way that, in most judicial raises, the judge ­­

9

incumbents are going to be challenged if you have

somebody who can get their own distinct message out.
MR. RICHARD:

Well, I have two responses,

12

Your Honor, and excuse me if I didn't clearly express

13

myself in my response to Justice Ginsburg's question.

14

But what I'm saying is, clearly, when you

15

tell an incumbent judge that that judge can personally

solicit money, that's going to give an incumbent judge,

who has far more intimidation power, an advantage over a

The other thing I'd like to comment, if I

might go back to the question that Justice Alito asked

the difference in the impact upon this Petitioner's free

speech between sending a letter to one person or

9

personally confronting one person and, on the other

If you look at

hand, sending it to 5 or 10 or 50 people, if it would

move the free speech needle in this case one iota

because there's very little impact upon that candidate's

5

able to broadcast the message.

Now, that's not the wording that the Court
