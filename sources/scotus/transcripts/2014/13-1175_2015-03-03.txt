Mr. Rosenkranz.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case is about whether to deprive scores

12

of cities of one of the most effective tools that they

13

have developed to deter human trafficking, prostitution,

14

and drug crimes that have seized the ­­ the ground in

15

America's hotels and motels.

16

The ordinance in question is the least

17

intrusive of ­­ inspection scheme that this Court has

18

ever encountered.

19

single book containing only information that the hotels

20

transcribe specifically for the city and that they've

21

been turning over to the police by operation of law for

22

150 years.

23

It is limited to showing the police a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

questions:

25

for 150 years the same?

Could you ­­ first, two

Is the information that they've been keeping
Because looking at the

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

requirements, the early information was basically

2

somebody's name and ­­ I'm not even sure ­­ their

3

address.

4

registry and requirements have information that Federal

5

law doesn't permit to be disclosed, like driver's

6

license, credit card information.

7

says you can't disclose that information.

8
9

But today's information has ­­ or today's

I mean, Federal law

So isn't there a difference?

It's not the

same tradition over 150 years.

10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

You are right, Your Honor,

11

that the amount of information has increased.

12

privacy interests, however, have been pretty much the

13

same.

14

were charged and so forth, and that is the ­­ the ­­ the

15

information that the ­­ that the hotels have argued is

16

the most private.

17

The

It was name and address and the rate that they

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All of the

18

things that you say, the most effective tool for

19

trafficking, prostitution, child molestation, none of

20

that sounds like it's ­­ the purpose of the search is

21

administrative.

22

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, it is administrative,

23

Your Honor, and to understand why it's administrative,

24

you have to focus first on the target.

25

is not people who are accused of crimes.

4
Alderson Reporting Company

The target here
The target is

1

the motels and the hotels who are required to keep

records, to record information.

3

required to record the information?

4

purpose, and the deterrent purpose more specifically is

5

that criminals do not like to register.

6

like to record their information.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And why are they
For the deterrent

They do not

Mr. Rosenkranz, are you

8

saying then that the police can do this ­­ can request

9

these records on demand, and they don't have to have any

10

reason at all ­­ no reasonable suspicion, no probable

11

cause, nothing ­­ because the purpose is to deter people

12

from staying in hotels who might do bad things.

13

no ­­ nothing like a reasonable suspicion requirement.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So

That's correct, Your Honor.

15

It's the same rationale that this Court adopted in

16

Burger, that frequent, unannounced spot inspections are

17

necessary in order to achieve that deterrent purpose;

18

that if the hotels do not record all the names, and more

19

specifically, they record most names but not the names

20

of the ­­ of the guests that they know are criminals,

21

there's no way to know, unless you have this frequent,

22

unannounced inspection, that someone is missing.

23

there's a real necessity here as there was in Burger and

24

in Biswell.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

Can you tell me how many

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

prosecutions there have been ­­ and I use the word both

2

criminally or civil ­­ for the failure to register

3

people?

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, there have been

5

numerous prosecutions.

6

complaints in this case, which are in the beginning of

7

the joint appendix, refer to the plaintiffs having been

8

prosecuted multiple times, or fined, for failure ­­ for

9

failing to keep the records.

10

I can't tell you how many.

The

And I guess I do want to underscore this

11

point about necessity.

12

registers are empty.

13

decline to record the names of those who they know are

14

criminals, or the motels do ­­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is not that the
The problem is that the hotels

But that has nothing to

16

do with the free right to search.

17

refusing to do it are going to refuse to do it.

18

19

constitutional challenge.

20

access to that record.

21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

22

let me just break it down.

23
24
25

Those people who are
A

What does is the unfettered

Agreed, Your Honor, and so

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Those people who don't

want to do it are not going to do it anyway.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Exactly.

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Those people who

Official

1

don't want to do it go somewhere else or don't commit

2

their crimes, but if they ­­ if they are forced to do

3

it, which is to say the motel won't let them stay there

4

unless they register, then they will not commit those

5

crimes in the motels.

6

that the motels are enforcing that obligation is to

7

descend on them without notice as ­­ as Justice Ginsburg

8

was saying, and frequently, so that they never know when

9

the police are going to come.

10

And the only way to make sure

Why?

To make sure that

they are indeed recording the information.

11

And why is the real time observation key?

12

It's because they've been busy, the police show up and

13

they have a register, and they notice that room

14

number ­­ room No. 2 is unoccupied according to the

15

register, but they see someone in room No. 2.

16

only from real time observation that there is a violation

17

here.

18

nothing to compare it to.

19

They know

If they get the register a month later, they have

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You ­­ you mean they can

20

walk up and down the halls and see that nobody's in the

21

certain room?

22

I don't know quite how you do that.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, the way

it works in particular ­­

it's right there, but room No. 1204 ­­

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
out in the open.

You can sit there and see ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

about room 1204?

5

all over the hotel.

6

So motels, for example, are

What about my question

You seem to say the police can wander

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, if ­­ the police may

7

be allowed to wander around the hotel.

8

will not see much if what they're doing is wandering

9

back and forth looking at particular rooms.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

They probably

I suppose in motels they

11

can see what rooms have cars in front of them.

12

suppose as to room 1204 they can see, usually behind the

13

desk what ­­ what keys are missing, what ­­ what rooms

14

appear not to be occupied.

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

And I

That's correct, Your Honor,

16

and that's why the real time observation is so key,

17

because you can't do that a month later.

18

we have the same necessity ­­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sure.

And that's why

Why?

I mean,

20

what you're saying is it's easier to prosecute, but it

21

doesn't mean that you can't devote some resources and

22

find this out.

23

police do for a lot of crimes.

24

going in for two hours and leaving, and you keep a

25

record of it.

You do a surveillance which is what
And you watch people

You can even stop those people who are

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

leaving to ask them.

2

So there's a whole lot of law enforcement

3

techniques that could be used to combat the situations

4

you're talking about.

5

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

6

But not nearly as

effectively, Your Honor, because ­­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, since when has the

8

Fourth Amendment completely been abandoned to how

9

effective the proof that the police can get at a moment

10

should be?

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, that's

12

not the test.

13

not as effective, and it simply doesn't work, Your

14

Honor.

15

But Dewey refers to the fact that it's

Let me give you an example.

If all the police are doing is looking for

16

who's in what room and what keys are missing, they don't

17

actually know what to look for until long after the

18

fact.

19

there are many motels where they can't ­­ where they

20

can't do it, for example, look at the keys because

21

they're not available and easy to see.

22

having the information right in front of them, and then

23

comparing it to things that they might be able to

24

observe.

25

They may be looking for the wrong thing.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And

And so it's

But, Mr. Rosenkranz, why

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

isn't this just like Barlow's really?

That it's not

2

necessary on the following rationale:

Number one, most

3

people will consent so that you go ­­ the police go into

4

a hotel and say we'd like to see your registry, most

5

people are going to consent.

6

there's a real basis for believing that the evidence is

7

going to be altered or destroyed, you can seize it

8

pending judicial review, or you can get an

9

administrative warrant ex parte and conduct a surprise

10

If somebody says no, and

examination if you want to.

11

So we talked about all of those things in

12

Barlow's, about how ­­ why that suggested that these

13

warrantless searches were not necessary.

14

this different?

15

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

What makes

Your Honor, what makes this

16

different is the distinction between Barlow's on the one

17

hand and Burger, Dewey, Biswell, Colonnade, on the other

18

hand, and that is the movability of information.

19

is the transience and ­­ of the information that you use

20

to verify.

That

In Barlow's, if there is an unsafe

22

condition, there is an unsafe condition, and it's hard

23

to see.

7

as I said, if in an unusual case you have the feeling

8

that the hotel is complicit, you can make sure to freeze

9

But that's going to be an unusual case,

and mostly, the registry is going to be there.

14

The registry is the registry, and

To the extent not you can go get a

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If you prevail in this

case and a member of the Court sits down to write the

opinion, does he or she have to use the phrase

20

"reasonable expectation of privacy" and say there is no

21

reasonable expectation of privacy in our society, in our

culture, in our day, or do we just forget that phrase?

23

In ­­ in a way, as we all know it's circular, that if we

say there is a reasonable expectation, then there is.

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

If the Court adopts the

17

Burger rubric, what the Court was doing in Burger was

18

saying because this is so heavily regulated in the

19

context of this case, because everyone knows that these

registers have been reviewed by the police for 15 years,

MR. DREEBEN:

­­ my point here is that this

is ­­ we're dealing here with businesses which have

13

reduced expectations of privacy, and we are not dealing

14

with entry into the nonpublic areas of the businesses,

15

which is what Marshall's was concerned with, Colonnade,

16

Biswell, Burger, all of those cases.

17

So the Ninth Circuit itself did not apply

18

the rules that govern those kinds of situations where

19

the Court has sometimes said an administrative warrant

20

is required and other times said it is not.

JUSTICE ALITO:

This is a facial challenge.

Kennedy, in the sense that the ­­ the statute provides

encouragement for a potentially recalcitrant hotel owner

18

to produce it, because it's an offense for him not to.

19

But more importantly, I think for the

20

Court's evaluation of the facial challenge issue is that

there's no record in this case about what kind of

privacy expectations actually exist with respect to

uniformed detectives in the backroom so the guests don't

I think it's quite intrusive.

MR. DREEBEN:

The Ninth Circuit treated it

20

as a lesser degree of intrusion than an inspection of

all of the private areas of the business; and that's why

it applied the subpoena line of cases.

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. GOLDSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court:
We ask the Court to hold that the city does

11

not need to go to the judge in advance and get a

12

warrant, but instead, that it merely needs to issue us a

13

one­page subpoena.

14

but it's going to be enforced unless the city isn't

15

actually implementing a legitimate administrative scheme

16

because it's searching us to harass us or to investigate

17

crimes.

18

Now, we can object to that subpoena,

this line of cases is that the government show that it's

5

part of an ordinarily administrative scheme.

6

But the second part is what's missing, and

7

the key case that's mentioned in passing by Mr. Dreeben,

called Donovan v. Lone Steer.

And it was decided by ­­

10

an opinion by then Justice Rehnquist, it's an unanimous

11

opinion, and it considers a circumstance very similar to

12

this, and that is, under the Fair Labors Standards Act,

13

the government can do just what it does here, and that

14

is it just demands employment records.

15

And the reason this Court said that that

comports with the Fourth Amendment is there is a

balance, and that is that the government has to issue a

concern made up by the city's lawyers in this Court when

what this Court has said in cases like Camara and See,

that Justice Scalia is asking is, is there a reason to

No.

And what this Court said in both of those

cases is that with rare exceptions, like the $10,000

that in 2002, the Department of Justice did a study, and

Because they can do

17

The government can require any business to keep track of

18

all of its transactions and all of its customers.

19

if the government can then just say, all right, now,

20

give us all that information, then they've reduced the

21

Fourth Amendment to a nullity.

But what

with all respect, and that is, the records there are how
