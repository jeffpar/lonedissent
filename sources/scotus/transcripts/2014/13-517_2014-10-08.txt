CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Shanmugam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

7

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In McDonough v. Greenwood, this Court held

11

that a party is entitled to a new trial where it can

12

show that a juror was materially dishonest at voir dire,

13

regardless of whether the juror's dishonesty actually

14

infected the verdict.

15

A McDonough claim is thus an inquiry into

16

the composition of the jury.

It is not an inquiry into

17

the validity of the verdict.

And for that reason,

18

Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) unambiguously permits

19

the introduction of testimony about statements made

20

during deliberations in support of a McDonough claim.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But ­­ but wasn't that a

22

case in which a third party came and gave the

23

information?

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That is correct.

And so we

are certainly not arguing that McDonough itself resolved

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the question of the scope of Rule 606(b).

2

think that the nature of the McDonough inquiry is really

3

critical here in determining whether Rule 606(b)

4

applies.

5

But we do

And in particular we think that the critical

6

fact is that McDonough in no way requires an inquiry

7

into what actually took place in the jury room.

8

as we say in the briefs, a type of structural error.

9

And by that, I mean that it has no prejudice component.

10

It is,

And in that regard it is critically

11

different from other types of claims, such as a claim of

12

outright jury bias, where prejudice is required.

13

it's really for that reason that we think Rule 606(b)

14

unambiguously permits evidence of this variety to be

15

admitted.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

I thought that the whole

17

rationale behind this is we don't want to invade the

18

jury province with information about what went on in the

19

jury room.

20

people might think it makes no sense.

21

eavesdropper, and that's okay, but you can't have a

22

juror itself.

23

And that's a pretty old rule.

And some

You can have an

So this, what's involved here is a juror

24

reporting what she heard during the deliberations.

25

it seems to me that's exactly the kind of thing that is

4
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official

1

not permitted.

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Ginsburg, we're

3

certainly talking about statements made during

4

deliberations, and we are not disputing that this is the

5

type of evidence that is subject to the rule.

6

argument concerns the first requirement of Rule 606(b),

7

which goes to the type of inquiry during which evidence

8

that is otherwise covered by the rule would be

9

admissible.

Our

And I do think that Rule 606(b) embodies a

10

balance.

11

policy concerns, which Respondent and the government

12

understandably emphasize, of finality and jury secrecy.

13

It isn't simply about the countervailing

There is, of course, a countervailing

14

concern here about fairness.

15

principal concern on which the rule of McDonough itself

16

was based.

25

at the voir dire stage.

So the judge instructs the

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So two responses to that,

2

Justice Ginsburg.

3

reply brief, our rule has been the rule, both on the

4

Federal level and on the State level, in numerous

5

jurisdictions.

6

there is really no evidence of the floodgates problem

7

that Respondents suggest will follow if this Court

8

adopts our interpretation.

9
10
11

First of all, as we point out in our

And we would respectfully submit that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
prevail.

Well, perhaps if you

Why not?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that goes to my second

12

response, which is that I think that it is going to be

13

very difficult in the hypothetical you posit for a party

14

to make out a successful McDonough claim.

15

simply because the requirements of McDonough are in fact

16

quite stringent.

17

And that is

And in particular, the first requirement of

18

McDonough is that the moving party must show that the

19

response was intentionally dishonest.

20

think that the Court really meant intentionally

21

dishonest at the time of

22

hypothetical that the government uses in its brief ­­

23

voir dire.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And by that, I

So to take the

I think you're missing the

24

point of Justice Ginsburg's question.

25

not whether the McDonough claim ultimately would

6
Alderson Reporting Company

The question is

Official

1

prevail.

2

jurors about what went on in the jury room is going to

3

be solicited in an effort to prove a McDonough claim.

The question is whether the testimony from

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well ­­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I guess your answer to

6

­­ what's implicit in what you're saying is that it

7

would be permissible to receive that testimony in that

8

situation.

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, Justice Alito, I think

10

there are two separate issues here.

11

concern about undue solicitation.

12

explained, there are a variety of rules that I think

13

impose appropriate limits on a lawyer's ability to go

14

out and get evidence of this variety.

15

lawyers always have an incentive to talk to jurors if

16

they are able to do so.

17

The first is the
And as we have

And of course

Our point is simply that, to the extent that

18

there is a concern raised about harassment of jurors,

19

that is already dealt with, and appropriately so, by

20

governing rules.

21

Now, I think Justice Ginsburg's question ­­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry.

I didn't

23

follow that.

24

in talking to ­­ what's to prevent them from doing so if

25

the payoff could be as significant as you're looking for.

You said lawyers always have an interest

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think at a minimum,

2

Mr. Chief Justice, lawyers certainly would have that

3

incentive, even if we were to lose this case, because in

4

talking to jurors, that conversation could very well

5

lead to evidence that unquestionably would be

6

admissible, because, after all, a party can always make

7

a McDonough claim based on extrinsic evidence.

8
9

And so, for instance, if in fact a juror had
posted something on Facebook that indicated that the

10

juror had been dishonest at voir dire, there's really no

11

debate that that would be admissible.

12

But to go to Justice Ginsburg's question,

13

really sort of the second part of this, I think it's

14

important to remember that the mere fact that the

15

evidence is admissible under Rule 606(b) is not the end

16

of the inquiry.

17

and probative with regard to the requirements of

18

McDonough.

19

The evidence still has to be probative

And I think perhaps the best example that I

20

would give is actually an example that the government

21

uses in its brief, the example of the situation where

22

the jurors go back into the jury room and they flip a

23

coin in order to resolve the case.

24
25

Now, the government suggests that perhaps a
party could seek to use that as evidence that the jurors

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

were in fact dishonest when they said that they could be

2

fair and impartial at the time of voir dire.

3

that is pretty weak evidence of that for the simple

4

reason that the requisite showing under McDonough is

5

that the juror intended to be dishonest at the time of

6

voir dire.

7

But if so,

And in the coin flip hypothetical, it might

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, again, I think that

this really goes to the requirements of McDonough as

9
Alderson Reporting Company

1

opposed to the interpretation of Rule 606(b).

2

think that there's a meaningful difference between a

3

juror simply bringing personal experiences to bear on

4

the one hand and a juror doing so in a way that

5

indicates that the juror was, as was true in this case,

6

simply unwilling to award damages to Petitioner in a

7

case of this variety.

But I

And I think it's important to underscore the
extent that the facts of this case shed some light on

the legal question.

11

a question involving fairness and impartiality.

were also questions asked about whether the jurors would

13

be willing to award damages of various types in a case

14

of this variety.

But this is not simply a case about
There

And to point to the evidence of dishonesty

16

in the record at pages 40a, to 41a of the appendix to the

17

petition, Juror Titus said that Juror Whipple said in the

18

discussions that if her daughter had been sued for the

19

accident for which she was responsible, it would have

20

ruined her life.

21

In our view, that is evidence that the juror

22

was unwilling to follow the instructions and to apply

23

the law to the facts.

24

strongly supports the inference that the juror was

25

dishonest at the time of voir dire when she answered ­­

9

this is obviously not smoking gun evidence.

This is not

10

a situation where the juror comes into the jury room and

11

says, look, I really lied when I answered those

12

questions at voir dire.

13

It is inferential evidence, and it will be a

14

matter for Judge Viken on remand if this Court agrees

15

with our interpretation to determine first of all

16

whether this affidavit is in fact probative evidence of

17

intentional dishonesty, and second ­­

Because you want to set

Well, this is obviously a

case about the interpretation of that language.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I think it's critical to

realize that that language does not simply refer to any

24

challenge to the verdict.

It refers to inquiries into

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

would you have an inquiry into the validity of the

verdict absent juror misconduct?

5

use that statement in any other part of your case.

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You're not going to

But the critical point,

7

Justice Sotomayor, is that that language focuses on the

8

inquiry and it focuses on the substantive inquiry

9

mandated by the claim at issue.

10

And again, as I indicated at the outset, a

11

claim of juror dishonesty during voir dire does not

12

require any examination of the verdict itself.

13

not depend in any way on what took place in the jury

14

room.

15

that a McDonough claim is qualitatively different from a

include the first but not the second I guess I'm just

25

not getting as a matter of language.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Sure.

Well, I do think that

2

you have to give meaning to every word in this

3

provision.

4

different from a provision that just refers to

5

challenges to the verdict.

6

that in this case, as in many others, we are seeking as

7

the remedy on our McDonough claim a new trial.

8

component of that, once a verdict has been reached, is

9

obviously that the verdict should be set aside.

10

In other words, I'm not disputing the

And I really do think that this provision is

And it certainly it true

And a

11

proposition that our purpose here is to obtain a new

12

trial, and of course, therefore, to set aside the

13

verdict that has already been reached.

14

My point is simply that a McDonough claim in

15

no way turns on the manner in which the jury has reached

16

the verdict.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I know, but ­­ so maybe

18

we're just going back and forth here.

19

into the validity of the verdict means asking the

20

question, is the verdict valid?

21

the verdict valid, can have answers that refer either to

22

the deliberative process itself or to the composition of

23

the jury.

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But an inquiry

And the question, is

But that is not the question

that a McDonough claim asks.

And I think the best

14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

evidence of that is that I think it's really undisputed

2

that a McDonough claim can be brought even before a

3

verdict has been reached.

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I haven't ­­ I haven't

5

quite counted, but you keep saying this is a McDonough

6

claim.

7

Rehnquist does not cite Rule 606.

8

I think I'm correct.

9

If you read the McDonough case, Chief Justice

MR. SHANMUGAM:

You're absolutely correct.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

us, don't look at Rule 606.

12

That's what you're telling us.

13

He does not cite.

And so you want to tell

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Just look at McDonough.
It's a whole ­­

I am eager for you to look

14

at the language of Rule 606 because I think it supports

15

our position.

16

McDonough at all is because Rule 606 requires you to

17

look at the type of inquiry that the claim at issue

18

mandates.

19

The only reason that we're talking about

And I think in many ways this nature ­­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But it also requires you

20

to look at who is producing the evidence.

21

juror is producing the evidence and McDonough was a

22

third person.

23

And here, the

It's different.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, the rest of Rule

24

606(b)is, of course, all about that, because it is all

25

about the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion.

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

And again, there's no debate that that portion of the

2

rule sweeps quite broadly and would otherwise include

3

the evidence at issue here.

4

Our point is simply that a McDonough claim

5

is a type of structural error and I think that that

6

points up the ­­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you're taking a case

8

that had nothing to do with a juror testifying about

9

what ­­ what ­­ the deliberations in the jury room.

10

think you're using the case for much more than it's

11

worth, much more than the opinion writer put into it.

12

It just didn't present the question of what about a

13

juror testifying about the deliberations in the jury

14

room.

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I

But, Justice Ginsburg, I do

16

think that the nature of a McDonough claim points up one

17

of the oddities of Respondent's position, which is that

18

there's really no dispute that if a McDonough claim is

19

brought before a verdict has been reached, that

20

evidence ­­ even evidence from the jury room would be

21

admissible.

22

forward before the jury actually completed its

23

discussions and reached a verdict, I think there's no

24

dispute here ­­ at least I don't see any dispute in the

25

briefs ­­ that that evidence would be admissible.

And so, for instance, if a juror came

16
Alderson Reporting Company

2

held that evidence of this variety would be admissible

3

5

a McDonough claim based on this type of evidence.

6

the framers of the rule intended to disturb what was the

prevailing practice at common law, particularly after

this Court's decision in Clark.

25

in the history of the rule that suggests that.

First, there's no indication that

And if

anything, I think that the history of the rule suggests

2

that the central focus in framing the rule was on

3

excluding evidence concerning the manner in which the

4

jury reached its verdict, and not evidence that was used

5

to demonstrate that the jury was improperly constituted.

6

Now, again, because the rule focuses on the

7

inquiry mandated by the claim at issue, we think that

8

ours is the better textual interpretation.

9

minimum, if the Court thinks that the rule is somehow,

But at a

10

by its terms, ambiguous, I would simply make two points.

11

First, we do think that the canon of constitutional

avoidance would apply in this context.

14

constitutional problem with excluding evidence in cases

involving racial bias.

think that the Court reached that conclusion based

think that the Court viewed the inquiry in that case in

words, I think that the Court was operating on the

premise that the underlying claim there would require a

In other

My point is simply that when we're looking

19

at the policy balancing that is required here, the

20

better point of reference is this Court's decision in

Clark where the Court suggested ­­ albeit in the context

of contempt proceedings ­­ the concerns about fairness

outweighed the litany of concerns about jury secrecy and

That is correct.

the Court did indicate that its rule was consistent with

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHEILA L. BIRNBAUM
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. BIRNBAUM:

Thank you, Your Honor.

May

it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice:
What the Petitioner would do here is change

6

the rules of 606 and how it would apply.

7

This Court has said its language is clear.

8

Petitioner does not emphasize is that what they did

9

below was to make a motion for a new trial and to

606 is clear.
What

10

invalidate the verdict.

11

dishonesty of the juror doesn't change anything from the

12

Tanner case where the grounds for the new trial was that

13

the jurors were drinking during the trial and during

14

deliberations.

15

The fact that the ground was

McDonough doesn't change the nature of

16

606(b).

17

out, is that if there is an inquiry, that inquiry would

18

have to be such, but it does not tell you why it's

19

admissible.

20

And this, the Petitioner has conceded is not admissible.

21

It is jury testimony of what happened during

22

deliberations.

23

All McDonough says, I think as you have pointed

And Rule 606 tells us what's admissible.

So that's clear.

So what are we fighting about?

We're

24

fighting about what did Congress mean by during an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH E. HARRINGTON
FOR THE UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
MS. HARRINGTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Any hearing on a motion for a new trial is

16

an inquiry into the validity of a verdict.

17

when a plaintiff ­­ when a litigant brings a McDonough

18

claim because of what it ­­ the litigant is arguing is

19

that verdict that was issued in his case is invalid

20

because the tribunal that issued the verdict was

21

improperly constituted.

22

litigant were arguing that the judge that issued a

23

decision in a case should have recused herself from the

24

case based on some sort of conflict.

same if a litigant were arguing that the jury had 5

That's true

It would be the same if the

34

members or 25 members.
In each of those examples, how the argument

3

goes is that the ­­ the tribunal was improperly

4

constituted and so the verdict that was issued was

5

invalid because an improperly constituted tribunal

6

cannot issue a valid verdict.

7

Now, Mr. Shanmugam says that we should limit

8

the phrase "inquiry into the validity of a verdict" to

9

cases where what you're inquiring into is what happened

10

in a jury room.

11

usage, I think we ­­ it's not hard to imagine an inquiry

12

into the validity of a verdict that would not look into

13

what happened in a jury room.

14

criminal defendant who's convicted files a motion for a

15

new trial based on sufficiency of the evidence, I think

16

anyone would think that the hearing on that motion is an

17

inquiry into the validity of a verdict because a verdict

18

that's based on insufficient evidence is not valid.

19

wouldn't look at what happened in the jury room and so

20

you may have no occasion to apply Rule 606(b) in that

21

kind of inquiry, but it would certainly be an inquiry

22

into the validity of a verdict.

11

responsive.

12

But it is true that in California and in

13

about five other States, this type of evidence is

14

admitted because those States apply the common ­­ the

15

Iowa version of the common law rule.

16

rule, anything that jurors said during deliberations you

17

can admit testimony about because it wasn't something

18

that was internal to a juror's mind, it was something

19

that could be corroborated or rebutted by other jurors.

20

And so this type of evidence would be admissible in

21

those five or six States because of they apply a

22

different type of ­­ different version of ­­ in the

23

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I think there are just four very quick

13

points that I'd like to make.

14

to the text of the rule and this question of whether

15

this constitutes an inquiry into the validity of the

16

verdict, I would just say one thing in response to what

17

Ms. Harrington has just said.

18

files a motion for a new trial based on the

19

insufficiency of the evidence, that is, by definition, a

20

claim that can be brought only at the close of the

21

evidence in the case.

First of all, with regard

If, for instance, a party

22

A McDonough claim is critically different

23

because that claim ripens at the point at which the

24

allegedly dishonest juror is actually empaneled.

25

a McDonough claim could be brought before the verdict

38
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official

1

has been reached or after the verdict has been reached.

2

And to the extent that the argument here is that the

3

jury is a black box and that one shouldn't look into the

4

jury's deliberations, I would note, again, that evidence

5

of this variety would plainly be admissible either

6

before a verdict has been reached or in a contempt

7

proceeding after a verdict has been reached.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes.

But, of course,

you'd ­­ you'd have no incentive to do that until you

10

lose, right?

11

the verdict goes against you at which point you ­­ you

12

would make the claim.

13

So you would rather sit around and see if

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, that is ­­ that is

14

certainly true, but the ­­

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Is anybody going to do

Well, there are cases where

19

the evidence comes to light, typically when a juror

20

actually comes to the judge and then the judge takes

21

some action based on the statements that have been

22

recorded.

McDonough claim doesn't in any way depend on the

That simply points up the fact that a

3

McDonough claim, again, in no way depends on what

4

actually took place in the jury room in terms of the

5

manner in which the jury reached its verdict.

6

Second, I want to address this question of

7

the state of the law which I think is critically

8

important here because it really goes ­­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can you explain the

10

manner in which the jury reached its verdict?

11

that the testimony of Titus was she made this statement

12

about her daughter and she persuaded all the other

13

jurors to go along with her.

That's the manner in which

14

the jury reached its verdict.

It didn't follow the law,

15

it followed what this woman was alleged to have said.

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I thought

Justice Ginsburg, the Titus

17

affidavit does contain those allegations, but those

18

allegations are utterly irrelevant to the resolution of

19

a McDonough claim.

20

for purposes of the McDonough claim whether the other

21

jurors were influenced or whether the other jurors said,

22

we don't care about your daughter's experience, that

23

doesn't affect our decisionmaking in the slightest.

24

that is because a McDonough claim is designed to

25

identify juror dishonesty at voir dire without regard to

the current state of the law ­­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, presumably that's

5

because we assume impact, isn't it?

6

sort of built into the rule.

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So the impact is

Well, it's built into the

8

rule only in the sense that it has to be material

9

dishonesty.

And so, if a juror dishonestly answered a

10

question about his or her name at voir dire, a court

11

would say that that's immaterial.

12

that McDonough does not require any analysis of actual

13

prejudice as the proceedings actually played out, and

14

that in our view is the critical distinction.

15

My point is simply

Now, let me say something about the current

16

state of the law because I think there's a certain

17

amount of uncertainty based on this argument about that

18

and I want to clarify that.

19

the rule in the Ninth Circuit since its decision in Hard

20

that evidence of this variety is admissible.

21

respectfully submit that my friend Ms. Birnbaum simply

22

misreads the Hard case when she argues that that is

23

dicta, and the best evidence of that is how that rule

24

has been applied in the Ninth Circuit because I think it

25

has been treated as the law now for some three decades.

It has unambiguously been

41
Alderson Reporting Company

And I

Official

1

And it is clearly the law in California in the wake of

2

the California Supreme Court's decision in People v.

3

Castaldia.

4

Our point is that there has been less than

5

one decision that we've been able to find, whether

6

reported or unreported, in each of those jurisdictions

7

per year since those rules were adopted.

8

talking about decisions, I'm not just talking about

9

decisions in which McDonough claims were successful.

And when I'm

10

I'm talking about decisions in which evidence of this

11

variety has even been sought to be admitted.

12

there's really no evidence that this is a problem in

13

those jurisdictions and we have been unable to find any

14

suggestion in the secondary literature that this is a

15

problem either.

16

And so

And to the extent that Ms. Birnbaum

17

complains that we only cited those cases in our reply

18

brief, I would note that it's really Respondent's burden

19

here to identify evidence that this is, in fact, proven

20

to be a problem.

about this distinction between the Iowa rule and the

4

where only evidence of the jurors' thought processes is

7

But this points out another point of
Respondent and the government talk

But even in jurisdictions that apply the
Federal rule, courts have held that evidence of this

variety is admissible.

talking about two separate questions:

12

the type of evidence that is subject to exclusion; and

13

on the other hand, the type of inquiry during which such

14

evidence is excluded.

15

And that's simply because we're
On the one hand,

So again, we would respectfully submit that

16

there is no evidence that this is anything other than a

17

speculative concern that our interpretation would lead

18

to these difficulties with juror harassment and

19

undermining the finality of verdicts.

20

Let me say just a word about the issue of

21

racial bias.

22

a case involving, say, the application of the hearsay

23

rule, because this really goes to the fundamental

24

question of whether the factfinder itself was racially

15

And our point is simply that to the extent that the

17

should come into play and support our interpretation.

I would just say one last thing before the
