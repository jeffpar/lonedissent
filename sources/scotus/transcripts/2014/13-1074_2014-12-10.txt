ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROMAN MARTINEZ

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MARTINEZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Three features of the FTCA's text and

12

history make clear that Congress did not want to allow

13

equitable tolling of its time bar.

14

drafted that bar in 1946 using jurisdictional language

15

transplanted from the parallel Tucker Act context.

16

Second ­­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18
19

First, Congress

Is the ­­ is the word

"jurisdiction" used?
MR. MARTINEZ:

The word "jurisdiction" was

20

not used in ­­ in that language, Your Honor, but

21

the Court had interpreted that language in the Tucker

22

Act context in six cases beginning with the ­­

23

the Court's decision in Kendall in 1883.

24

decision ­­ those line of cases had made very clear not

25

only that the time bar was jurisdictional, but ­­

Alderson Reporting Company

And that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's the Court.

2

Congress did not say jurisdiction.

3

you are well aware that this Court, for some time now,

4

has been explaining that "jurisdiction" is a word of

5

many meanings, too many meanings, and has tried to

6

distinguish jurisdiction, meaning subject matter or

7

personal, from the rules, once a case fits jurisdiction,

8

how it will be processed in the Court.

9

me a time limitation, even a very stringent time

10
11

And I ­­ I'm sure

And it seems to

limitation, is not jurisdictional.
MR. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, I think two

12

points on that.

13

Congress acted in 1946 and it transplanted the ­­ the

14

identical words of the statute that ­­ of the Tucker

15

Act ­­ the statute governing Tucker Act claims, Congress

16

understood itself to be incorporating the same settled

17

meaning, and those words had already been given a

18

jurisdictional meaning by this Court.

19
20
21

First of all, I think that when

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Jurisdictional in the

narrow sense.
MR. MARTINEZ:

In ­­ in the sense that ­­

22

that ­­ that if ­­ that it went to the Court's ability

23

to hear the case ­­

24

JUSTICE SCALIA:

25

MR. MARTINEZ:

Yes, that's what I ­­
­­ and the jurisdictional

consequences were attached to those ­­ to those words.

2

In other words, the ­­ the issue had ­­ could not be

3

waived by the government, and no equitable tolling was

4

available.

5

In this Court's more recent cases, I think

6

the ones that, Justice Ginsburg, you were referring to,

7

in the Henderson case, what this Court said was that ­­

8

was that the Court will presume that a provision is

9

jurisdictional when a long line of this Court's cases,

10

undisturbed by Congress, has treated a similar provision

11

as jurisdictional.

12

And in this case, we have a statute that had

13

been interpreted by a long line of this Court's

14

decisions, all in the Tucker Act context, very similar

15

or identical ­­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But not the Tort Claims

17

Act.

18

the Court drew, it said if we characterize these as

19

jurisdictional in a prior case, we will stick with that.

20

But in the future, we're not doing that anymore.

21

The Tucker Act, I think the ­­ the line that

MR. MARTINEZ:

But I think what the Court

22

has said, both in the cases addressing jurisdiction and

23

in the cases ­­ in the Irwin line of cases addressing

24

the available of ­­ the availability of equitable

25

tolling is that the Court is not going to look for magic

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6

words in the statute.

2

the context, and the relevant historical treatment, and

3

that the overarching purpose of the inquiry is going to

4

be to find out what Congress understood itself to be

5

doing at the time that it enacted the statute.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's going to look to the text,

But, Mr. Martinez, wouldn't

7

that argument suggest that Irwin was really only good as

8

to new statutes?

9

Irwin?

10

As to statutes that were passed after

MR. MARTINEZ:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

11

I think ­­ I think what the Court did in Irwin, it

12

didn't conduct a lengthy historical analysis of all

13

statutes that had ever been passed.

14

it ­­ it based its ­­ its conclusion and ­­ and the

15

presumption on a kind of logical inference.

16

essentially reasoned, as I understood the decision, as

17

follows:

18

in the mine run of cases when Congress wants to take the

19

big step of waiving sovereign immunity, it's ­­ it's

20

reasonable to think that Congress also likely wanted to

21

take the small step of allowing equitable tolling.

22

And that ­­ and that may well have been true

But what it did was

The Court

The Court said that ­­ that when ­­ we think

23

in 1990, when Irwin was announced.

24

been true in 1972, when the statute that was addressed

25

in Irwin was announced.

It may have even

But we know for certain, and I

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

7
1

think the parties agree on this, that the rule in 1946,

2

when the FTCA was passed, was something quite different,

3

and the Court addressed that in the Soriano case just a

4

few years later in 1957.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What was different about

6

1972?

7

1972 statute, the extension of Title VII to federal

8

employees, why wouldn't that fall under the old regime

9

instead of the fresh look that Irwin took of it in 1990

10
11

They were pre­Irwin.

So why wouldn't 19 ­­ a

as applied to a 1972 statute?
MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think the ­­ the key

12

thing ­­ the ­­ the issue in this case is, obviously,

13

the FT ­­ is, of course, the FTCA.

14

are significant distinctions between the FTCA, which was

15

passed in 1946, and the provision that was passed in

16

1972 that was addressed in ­­ in Irwin.

17

statute­specific evidence, it's very detailed and is

18

much ­­ much more extensive than the evidence that was

19

before the Court ­­ or that was available in ­­ with

20

respect to Title VII.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think there

And we have

But, you see, I would ­­ I

22

guess I would have thought that really anything

23

pre­Irwin, the government could stand up and make a

24

very, very similar argument, which is, you know, in this

25

world we actually thought that a statute of limitations

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

8
1

with respect to a suit against a government was

2

jurisdictional, did not include equitable tolling, that

3

there were really no decisions the other way, that

4

Congress thought of that as the background rule.

5

what's to prevent this case from essentially becoming

6

everything prior to 1990 is presumed to be

7

jurisdictional contra Irwin?

8
9
10
11

MR. MARTINEZ:

And so

Well, we're not asking for

that presumption, and we don't think that the Court
needs to apply that presumption.
I think what the Court needs to do is to

12

look at the language of Irwin, which says that there's a

13

presumption.

14

inference about the mine run of cases.

15

that the presumption is rebuttable.

16

based on statute­specific evidence where the government

17

can come forward and overcome the presumption by showing

18

that, with respect to a particular law, Congress had a

19

different intent in mind.

20

It's based on its kind of logical

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But it also says

And it's rebuttable

So if there's ambiguity,

21

what breaks the tie?

22

there are some counters.

23

that Congress took this provision out of the

24

jurisdictional section, and put it in ­­ in a different

25

section, number one; and, number two, it said treat the

2

So those two counter.

MR. MARTINEZ:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5
6

With res ­­
What ­­ how ­­ how do we

break the tie?
MR. MARTINEZ:

Well, I think if there were

7

in fact a tie, I think the ­­ Irwin does ­­ does put

8

essentially the slight thumb on the scale in favor of no

9

equitable tolling.

But I don't think that there's a tie

10

in this case for a number of reasons.

11

address ­­ I think the primary reason is the Tucker Act

12

point which I mentioned.

13

textual points that you raised, Your Honor.

14

Let me just

But let me address the two

The first argument about the placement of

15

the provisions, as the Court knows, the provisions were

16

separated in 1948 as part of that recodification.

17

in the recodification law itself, in Section 33 of the

18

recodification law, Congress expressly forbade any

19

inference of legislative construction of what the

20

statutes meant based on the chapter of U.S. Code of

21

Title 28 in which it was placed.

22

that my friend makes that the placement of the

23

provisions in different chapters, that's ­­ that's an

24

argument that ­­ that Congress expressly took off the

25

table.

And

And so the argument

With respect to the second textual
argument ­­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

That was in the text of the

recodification?
MR. MARTINEZ:

Yes.

That was in ­­ in

6

Section 33 of the 1948 recodification.

7

that, Your Honor, but ­­ but I think this Court ­­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Does legislative history

support that, too?
MR. MARTINEZ:

It does.

11

history supports ­­ supports it.

12

texture, Justice Scalia.

13

And not only

The legislative

It's not just the

The ­­ with respect to the second argument,

14

Justice Sotomayor, that you raised, I think it's true

15

that there's language in ­­ elsewhere in the FTCA in

16

Section 2674 about the idea that ­­ that the FTCA

17

intended to create liability where a private person ­­

18

in circumstances where a private person would be liable

19

under State law.

20

Richards and what ­­ what a lot of courts have

21

recognized, including Judge Friendly's opinion for the

22

Second Circuit in the Kosak case is that the time bar

23

provision, 2401, is an exception to that principle and

24

is essentially a circumstance in which Congress

25

specifically indicated that it didn't want the same rule

But what this Court recognized in

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

11
1

to apply as would apply between private parties in ­­

2

under State law.

3

And so we don't think that those textual

4

arguments get a lot of traction here and they certainly

5

don't overcome the strongest textual argument which is

6

on our side, which is, of course, the express and

7

deliberate incorporation of the Tucker Act language that

8

it applied to Tucker Act suits in the court of claims.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Tucker Act doesn't have

10

to the same extent, in the same manner and to the same

11

extent as with respect to a private party.

12

in the Tort Claims Act.

13

MR. MARTINEZ:

That's new

It ­­ it's true that the

14

Tucker Act doesn't have that language.

15

needed that language because the Tucker Act ­­

16

essentially, that language in the Tort Claims Act, I

17

think, is intended to point to the substantive ­­ the

18

law that's supposed to be applied, as this Court

19

recognized in Richards.

20

to State law when you're applying the tort law.

21

I don't think it

And so it says, you know, look

The Tucker Act is a little different because

22

there you're applying Federal law.

23

Federal constitutional law, Federal statutory law or the

24

Federal common law of contracts in the Tucker Act

25

context.

You're applying

So it didn't need that language.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

12
1

But what the Court has recognized in its

2

cases is, again, that that principle of ­­ sort of the

3

parity principle, you know, treat the government like a

4

private party, that ­­ that 2401(b) is really an

5

exception to that principle.

6
7
8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I take it that your argument

would apply not only to 2401(b), but also to 2401(a)?
MR. MARTINEZ:

We ­­ the government's

position is that 2401(a) is ­­ is also jurisdictional,

10

not subject to tolling.

11

the Irwin inquiry requires a statute­specific inquiry.

12

And so ­­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But our argument is really that

But it's the same language.

14

And if I understood the argument you're ­­ you're

15

making, it's ­­ your essential argument is this

16

incorporated the Tucker language, Congress knew what the

17

Tucker language meant, therefore, Congress understood

18

these to be jurisdictional as well.

19

MR. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, I don't want to

20

resist your ­­ your point too much, but I do want to

21

point thought that 2401(a)'s history is slightly

22

different.

23

in the Tucker Act itself in 1887.

24

2501 actually came from the 1863 statute, and that's the

25

language, the actual ­­ you know, the 12­word phrase

The language in 2401(a) actually originates

Alderson Reporting Company

The language from

Official

13
1

that's repeated in 2401(b) comes from that provision.

2

So there's some slight differences, but we're not going

3

to fight.

4

2401(a) language is ­­ is jurisdictional and that's

5

being litigated in the lower courts.

6

We certainly would agree that the ­­ that the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I meant, I have to think

7

that this is just all over the U.S. Code, this kind of

8

language.

9

"shall be barred."

10
11

There's nothing unusual about this language
This is kind of the classic

language, right?
MR. MARTINEZ:

I think that the "shall be

12

barred" or "forever barred," that language does appear

13

in a couple of places.

14

important for purposes of our argument is not just that

15

two­word phrase, but the broader phrase, because the

16

broader phrase is what shows that when ­­ when the human

17

being who sat down on behalf of Congress to actually

18

write this statute, it shows, I think, that he was

19

basing it ­­ he was essentially cut and pasting from the

20

preexisting Tucker Act provision.

21

that's relevant is not just "forever barred," but the

22

phrase "every claim against the United States cognizable

23

shall be forever barred unless."

24

very ­­ it's not just the language itself, although the

25

language is identical, but it's clear that Congress,

But I think what ­­ what's

And so that language

And I think that it's

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

14
1

when it was drafting the FTCA, was ­­ its goal was to

2

fill a gap that had been left open in the Tucker Act.

3

The Tucker Act itself said that it would apply to

4

certain claims, quote, "not sounding in tort," unquote.

5

And the legislative history that ­­ that we've cited in

6

our briefs discussing the purposes of the FTCA makes

7

clear that Congress was looking at the ­­ the Tucker

8

Act, they saw that there was this hole for tort claims,

9

they wanted to plug that gap, and they wanted to give

10

tort claimants, in the language of the ­­ of the

11

relevant committee reports, the same right to a day in

12

court that claimants had under the Tucker Act.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It sounds to me like, the

14

way you're going about this inquiry, we're going to have

15

to take a case on every statute of limitations in ­­ in

16

the U.S. Code.

17

similar enough and maybe this would be a little bit

18

different, it has a few fewer words, and then we have to

19

look at the history, and we have to stare at the

20

drafting concerns of Congress.

21

was supposed to take us away from all that.

22

Because you're saying, well, this is

MR. MARTINEZ:

And I thought that Irwin

case on every statute of limitations, Your Honor.

25

think that ­­ that in those cases where the government

I

2

that the statute was ­­ was lifted, for example, from

3

the Tucker Act or from other similar statutes that had

4

been repeatedly interpreted as jurisdictional, I don't

5

think there's going to be much question about whether

tolling is allowed.

look at each statute separately, don't you?

MR. MARTINEZ:

When you

Federal statutes and it's conducted exactly the kind of

statute­specific inquiry into the text, the history, the

21

precedent, trying to figure out what Congress was

22

thinking.

And I think that's ­­ that's actually

JUSTICE ALITO:

After Irwin,

the other, are there any that you have concluded are not

held are not jurisdictional?

3

MR. MARTINEZ:

Your Honor, I confess that I

4

haven't gone through the ­­ the code with an effort to

5

try to figure out where ones that are not

6

jurisdictional.

7

are the ones that the Court has addressed, most

8

significantly in the Brokamp case, in Beggerly, in

9

Auburn Regional, in John R. Sand & Gravel, and now in ­­

I think the ones that I have looked at

10

in this case.

11

show is that what the Court has done with Irwin is not

12

to treat it as a conclusive presumption, but, rather, to

13

treat it as a rebuttable presumption ­­

14

And I think what ­­ what those precedents

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.

But there are two

15

kinds of ways that you can rebut something.

16

saying, here's something very distinctive about this

17

statute that shows that Congress meant for it to be

18

jurisdictional, that shows that Congress didn't mean for

19

equitable tolling to apply.

20

argument you are making here.

21

that basically says in this pre­Irwin world, Congress

22

understood that when it came to statutes against the

23

government, they would be jurisdictional and equitable

24

tolling would not apply, see the Tucker Act.

specific to the FTCA and there I think ­­ I don't want

5

to give you more than three, the golden rule of three,

6

but there are five distinctions.

7

off.

8
9

Our argument is

I can just tick them

One is the incorporation of the express
language of the Tucker Act.

Two is the fact that this

10

Court addressed this ­­ this particular statute, or at

11

least tort claims, in the Soriano decision.

12

addressed this particular provision 2401(b) in Kontrick.

13

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It also

I thought Soriano was ­­

MR. MARTINEZ:

It did, Your Honor, but ­­

16

but the Court expressly addressed ­­ it said that ­­

17

essentially, that the same rule that would apply in

18

Tucker Act cases would also apply to ­­ to statutes

19

waiving sovereign immunity for tort actions.

20

was a response to the point that we had made in our

brief ­­

immunity is what drives it, then the presumption would

MR. MARTINEZ:

I think ­­ I think at a

2

minimum, it would ­­ I think what we have in this

3

statute that was not present in Irwin is the fact that

4

this Court had expressly mentioned, you know, tort

5

actions; and then not only did the Court mention it, but

6

then Congress reenacted the statute in 1966, not just

7

against the backdrop of this Court's statement in

8

Soriano, but also against the backdrop of the uniform

9

view of the lower courts, including a number of courts

10

of appeals, that it all said that this statute was

11

jurisdictional, not subject to waiver, not subject to

12

tolling.

13

statute, the 1966 reenactment.

14

And so that's another unique feature of this

We also have a number of private laws, ten

15

real­life statutes that were passed by Congress that

16

seem to refer explicitly to 2401(b) as having ­­ as

17

being a jurisdictional statute.

And then finally, we have the fact that

Congress for 60 years, from the '20s through the 1980s,

that we're now ­­ that's now before us is such a case.

To get equitable tolling, it's

In order to get equitable tolling,

So isn't that the answer to it?

You have

Ordinarily,

4

the statute of limitations will govern, but if there are

equitable reasons, then there can be an exception.

6

those reasons have to be very strong.

7

MR. MARTINEZ:

But

Your Honor, I think that's

8

true, that's how the equitable tolling doctrine has been

9

conceived and if Congress were rewriting the statute

10

today, it may well decide ­­ it could well decide that

11

that would be a better approach.

12

Congress took at the time ­­ and I think this is best

13

reflected in the colloquy that's cited in page ­­ on

14

page 41 of our brief ­­ Congress considered the question

15

of whether in hardship cases it would be appropriate to

16

give judges some discretion where there was a good

17

reason for a ­­ for a claimant to file late.

18

And that suggestion was raised by

But the approach that

19

Congressman Gwynn and the Department of Justice ­­ this

20

was 2 years after the Act.

21

said look, it would just be impractical and it would

22

create too much of a burden on the government and it

23

would be impractical to have kind of a rule that was not

24

hard and fast.

25

The Department of Justice

And so Congress, in 1948, as that colloquy

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

23
1

showed, did not think that the FTCA that had been passed

2

two years earlier allowed for equitable tolling, and the

3

consistent view of Congress when it rejected proposals

4

to add tolling nine different times between 1946 and the

5

late '80s was that equitable tolling should not be

6

allowed.

7

And so in light of that statute­specific

evidence, I think it's ­­ it's eminently reasonable to

9

conclude that ­­ that, you know, the law is on our side.

9

I think ­­

That's actually right.
Justice Breyer, I think

that ­­ I think that, first of all, what this Court has

10

always said, of course, is that ­­ that the goal of

11

statutory construction in this context as in any other

12

is to look at the text in light of its context and its

historical treatment.

14

is to find what the legislative intent was with respect

to this particular statute.

there was market reliance by each succeeding Congress

on ­­ on the bills that had been proposed earlier, that

13

the omission of a ­­ of a provision from the final FTCA

14

that had been there before, we should treat that as a

15

deliberate choice, not an inadvertent omission.

16

think it was a deliberate choice here.

17

So I

And I think, with respect to the evolution

18

of the statute since then, as of 1966, we know that

19

Congress reexamined the time bar.

20

point in time, it was legislating against a backdrop

21

where this Court had suggested in Soriano that it was

22

jurisdictional, the lower courts had uniformly treated

23

it as jurisdictional, and not just by putting the label

24

on it, but by attaching jurisdictional consequences.

25

Congress reenacted the statute without any change in

Alderson Reporting Company

At that ­­ at that

meaning, and then even until the late '80s, it

repeatedly considered proposals to add forms of tolling

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If we were to adopt the

5

position that a statute can change in light of current

circumstances, what would that Congress think about it

not appropriate.

MR. SCHNAPPER:

So to say

I ­­ I think that's right.

15

As we said, most of the statutes are entirely different.

There's also another fundamental difference,

which is the claims recognized by the Tucker Act were

sent to the then newly­created Federal court of claims,

19

which only had whatever powers Congress was going to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That is, the government suggests even if the statute is

The ­­ the government's argument relies

And yet despite the fact that English statutes of
