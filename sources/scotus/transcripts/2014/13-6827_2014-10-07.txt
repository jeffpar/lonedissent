ORAL ARGUMENT OF DOUGLAS LAYCOCK

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

9

MR. LAYCOCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

40 other prison systems permit beards

11

without a length limit, yet Arkansas prohibits even half

12

an inch.

13

that courts have devised to evaluate their testimony.

14

And in their brief, they reject every means

So what they really seek is absolute

15

deference to anything they say just because they say it.

16

And that would be to repeal this statute de facto.

17
18

There may be deference to prison officials,
but there must be concrete limits to that deference.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If this prisoner wanted

20

to have a full beard, would RLUIPA require that the

21

prison administration allow him to do that?

22

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, some courts have said

23

yes.

24

beards and whether they're safe or whether they're

25

dangerous, but the 40 States that permit them suggest

There's very little in this record about full

Alderson Reporting Company

1

that the State would have a difficult burden of proof.

2

But that question is not presented here.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Laycock, the problem I

4

have with ­­ with your client's claim of ­­ of religious

5

requirement is the religious requirement is

6

full beard, isn't it?

7

that requires polygamy.

Now, let's assume

that he grow a

12

clipped to one ­­ one inch, isn't he?

13

I mean, you're still violating your

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, the religious teaching

14

is a full beard.

16

terms of Hadith that he referenced.

He testified that religiously half an

He offered an extremely conservative compromise to the

He's

MR. LAYCOCK:

He's ­­ he's supposed to have

2

a full beard, but a partial beard is better than none.

3

And that's not just in secular terms.

4

religious terms, which he explained on the record.

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

That's also in

You think on the

6

record that's what his religion would require if he

7

can't have a full beard.

8

MR. LAYCOCK:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
But I ­­ I mean,

10

you're really just making your case too easy.

11

one of the difficult issues in a case like this is where

12

to draw the line.

13

draw the line at half inch because that lets us win.

14

And the next day someone's going to be here with one

15

inch.

16

inches.

17
18

I mean,

And you just say, well, we want to

And maybe it'll be you.

And then, you know, two

It seems to me you can't avoid the legal
difficulty just by saying, all we want is half an inch.

19

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, most of the cases seek a

20

full beard or full hair.

And sooner or later, you will

21

have to decide one of those cases.

made a pro se decision to limit his request.

23

expressly limited the question presented.

is only about half an inch.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Alderson Reporting Company

But this case, he
The Court

So this case

Well, but we have to

1

decide this case pursuant to a generally applicable

2

legal principle, and that legal principle is one, it

3

seems to me, that demands some sort of a limit.

4

you're unwilling to articulate a limit to the principle

5

itself, it becomes a little bit difficult to apply it,

6

say, well, we don't know what the limit is because

7

you're only asking a half inch.

8

theoretical legal structure and ­­ and say you fall

9

within it.

10

MR. LAYCOCK:

And if

We'll apply a ­­ a

Well, I think, you know, the

11

limit has to be determined on a record in a case that is

12

seeking a ­­ a longer beard.

13

the larger issue than just half an inch that this case

14

presents is how do you administer ­­ the legislative

15

history suggests deference to prison officials in the

16

context of a compelling interest standard.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think, you know, what ­­

Yes.

So maybe we should ­­

18

maybe this was improvidently granted.

I don't want to

19

do these cases half inch by half inch.

Let's ­­ let's

20

take a case that involves a full beard.

I mean, the

21

next ­­ the next case will be one inch, then one and a

22

half inches, two inches.

MR. LAYCOCK:

They're not going to come in

that order.

likely, the next case is going to be a full beard

The next case is going to be ­­ most

2

has a limited question presented and has a serious

3

question of statutory interpretation.

4

This case

The courts below essentially applied the

5

pre­ RLUIPA

6

essentially unlimited deference to the prison officials.

7

constitutional standard that you have

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And then what has this

8

Court said about the standard under RLUIPA with

9

reference to prisons?

That the ­­ that the prison has

10

to show that its least ­­ least restrictive alternative

in order to meet the requirements of strict scrutiny,

12

and that's the prison's burden?

13

established?

14
15
16

MR. LAYCOCK:

Is that proposition

Well, your only prison RLUIPA

case is Cutter and that was a constitutional challenge.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes.

Do

17

you ­­ do you think RLUIPA displaces Turner as the right

18

standard?

MR. LAYCOCK:
replace Turner.

It was clearly intended to

It textually replaces Turner.

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

22

insofar as you're concerned?

23

MR. LAYCOCK:

And what is the test

The test is compelling

24

interests and least restrictive means and deference must

25

be administered in the context of that standard, not

8
Alderson Reporting Company

1

instead of that standard.

2

So if it's a close case on compelling

3

interest, they may well get deference.

4

reasoned and well­considered and informed explanation,

5

they deserve more deference.

6

due.

If they give a

More deference would be

Cutter says some ­­ Cutter says they get due

8

deference, but Cutter had no occasion to decide how much

9

deference is due or ­­ or how that ­­ how that should be

10
11

13

administered.
The textual standard is clearly compelling
interest and least restrictive means.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you put your

14

answer in practical terms.

15

what's the legal principle that you want us to apply,

16

and you announce it as give them the right deference.

17

It's a little bit circular, the answer, in my mind.

The Chief Justice asks you

18

Looking at what the circuits have been

19

doing, which one do you think articulates the best

20

approach to RLUIPA and what courts should be doing?

21

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, maybe Judge Gorsuch's

22

opinion in the ­­ in the Tenth Circuit.

23

sure any circuit has given a fully elaborated account of

24

deference in the context of a compelling interest test.

25

But I'm not

their explanation, the more deference is due.

2

they give concrete examples of specific harms?

3

treat similar risks the same way?

4

take account of solutions that have been found to work

5

in other jurisdictions?

religious needs of prisoners at any point, or do they

just reflexively say no?

8

So do

And the standard is other

9

similar risks.

The same way, then, what about a

10

1/4­inch rule?

Because that's what they allowed for

11

people who have dermatological problems.

12

MR. LAYCOCK:

They allow ­­ they allow a

13

quarter inch for medical beards.

14

a quarter inch for religious beards.

15

inch, I think, for medical beards, I think, fatally

16

undermines their claim that they can't administer a

17

length limit.

18

their other claims about ­­ about a 1/2­inch beard, that

19

this is in some ways like the case Justice Alito wrote

20

in Newark in the Third Circuit.

21

undermines all the alleged reasons for not allowing a

22

religious exception.

23

They don't allow even
But the quarter

And it ­­ and it somewhat undermines all

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The medical exception

There are ­­ there are

24

some religious practices ­­ I think that the Sikh

25

practice of not cutting hair ranks as a religious

10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

practice.

2

consistent with what you say is the standard, could a

3

prison say, we won't allow that because it is too easy

4

to hide contraband?

5

So not cutting hair and wearing a turban,

MR. LAYCOCK:

Yeah, that may be.

I don't

6

know what the evidence would show about Sikh hair

7

wrapped in a ­­ in a turban.

8

more serious issue than ­­ than what's presented in this

9

case.

But that's clearly a much

10

be different, but we don't have any evidence about it in

record in this case.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We don't really have a way to know on the

Mr. Laycock, you're relying

14

on this case really on ­­ on felt intuitions that this

15

couldn't possibly advance the State's interest.

16

the most part in these cases, there will be some

17

incremental gain with respect to the interests that this

18

State has.

19

But for

So whether it's a full beard or whether it's

20

long hair or whether it's a turban, there will be some

21

ability to say, even though it's just teeny tiny, there

22

is some increase in prison security that results from

23

disallowing this practice.

24
25

And I guess I want to know, and this really
fits in with several of the other questions that have

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

been asked here, is how do we think about that question

2

in the context of this statute?

3

MR. LAYCOCK:

I think they have to show

4

material ­­ this is a phrase in the government's brief,

5

and I think it's helpful ­­ a material effect on their

6

security situation.

7

is another way of de facto repealing the statute,

8

because you can always imagine some teeny tiny risk.

9

Any teeny tiny risk, however small,

And even

in Turner, under the rational

10

basis standard, the Court said the test isn't zero risk.

11

Even in Turner, the Court said you have to incur ­­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Teeny tiny isn't enough.

13

But how about, you know, measurable, although small?

14

Or, you know, at what point does it become something

15

that we say, yes, we have to take that into account?

16

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, I think material or

17

significant may be the best we can do.

18

example, that in 2011, they confiscated a thousand

19

cellphones.

I don't think a 1/2­inch beard would change

20

that number.

But if it went to 1,001 or 1,010, I don't

21

think that's material.

22

They say, for

significant increment.

5

have no examples of anything hidden in beards, and

6

certainly not in a very short beard, such as half an

7

inch.

8

And this is not

So

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the ­­ the

16

problem with deference, I think, is that if you accept

17

the fact that there is a point at which it does become a

18

problem, the full beard, Sikh with the ­­ the turban,

19

then you ­­ then there's the question of how you draw

20

the line.

21

And drawing the line, it strikes me, may be

22

the point at which you will consider deference to the

23

prison administrators.

24

of the equation by saying, look, we're only asking for

25

half an inch.

You take deference entirely out

13
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, we haven't taken

2

deference out of the equation, but when we only ask for

3

half an inch and when they offer so little evidence and

4

no

5

elsewhere, they haven't done anything to deserve

6

deference.

7

even with deference, you know ­­ even with some degree

8

of deference, it doesn't make out a compelling interest

9

on these facts and that's the question presented.

Where does this idea of deference come from

MR. YANG:

But the question I was asking was:

I don't think there's any

10

dissonance between the idea of strict scrutiny, which is

11

not a degree of proof required, it is a question about

12

whether you've identified a compelling interest and

13

shown that what the ­­ the burden is the least

14

restrictive means, that can be shown by preponderance of

15

the evidence.

16

And so when you're talking about deference

17

in this context, you're talking about deference to the

18

predictive judgments of officials based on their

19

experience and expertise, based on the fact that they

20

are, in fact, charged with protecting the public and

21

administering these prisons.

MR. YANG:

19

remember, this Court in ­­ in Grutter and in Cutter has

20

recognized that the application of strict ­­ what you

21

might broadly label strict scrutiny depends on context.

22

And Congress, when they enacted both RFRA and RLUIPA,

understood that these two concepts could be administered

together.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I thought we actually

used that in the recent RFRA case to suggest something

about RFRA as well.

MR. YANG:

That's because RFRA's definition

of religious exercise incorporates the RLUIPA

you were to go back to pre­RLUIPA case law, no one would

doubt that a State could, in fact, prohibit a 1/2­inch

The ­­ the point of

that, because it's very important to understand this in

our prison's unique environment.

21

that shaving a beard can enable an inmate to get into an

22

area where he's not supposed to be in ­­ that's at Joint

23

Appendix page 104 ­­ and that a beard can enable an

24

inmate to deviate from an inmate's appearance on an ID

badge.

That's on page 97 of the Joint

4

And, of course, the grooming policy itself

speaks in terms of maintaining the standard appearance

throughout the period of incarceration, minimizing

7

opportunities for disguise.

8

why this matters in our prison's unique environment and

9

why we're different, because it's a very important point

10

And let me explain a minute

here.

11

The testimony on the record on page 101 of

12

13

situation with barracks housing and inmates going

14

outside the fence in large groups of 30 to 60 per

15

barracks unit every day.

16

maximum security facility where they come out of a large

17

barracks holding 30 or 60 inmates, go out, and then come

18

back.

19

And there's a lot of traffic there, and in

20

that environment rapid and accurate identification of

21

the inmate by his face, his ­­ his ID badge and the

like, but also general familiarity with the inmate and

who the guards are dealing with is very important in

MR. CURRAN:

policy's rationale was follow doctor's orders.

Given the deference that was given here, the question

does the Court have to look at the individual request

MR. CURRAN:

Yes.

I think it's fair to say

the different elements.

I think, O'Lone ­­ I mean, I'll

12

credited prison officials' testimony that Muslim inmates

13

are sort of getting a good rehabilitative event by not

having to go back into the prison for Friday prayer

because they might as well get used to an intolerant

16

employer when they're out in the free world.

17

pass muster under compelling interest anymore.

18

that just ­­ that was the old standard and the interest

19

has to be truly compelling.

20

O'Lone

That won't
I mean,

On least­restrictive means, we think that

21

interest grounded mostly in cost and hassle would have

22

survived under the old regime which had a lot of, say,

23

dietary cases and the like.

24

fail a lot more often under RLUIPA than under the

25

previous standard.

Those probably will ­­ will

staffing, ever so slight, might say, okay, that ­­ that

is required to pass least restrictive means, but it

5

So I think even under a deferential approach

6

to RLUIPA, grounded in logic and common sense, you'll

7

still have more vigor under the RLUIPA standard and

8

cases will go the other way more often than under the

You made a statement just

3

then, Mr. Laycock, about how to think about deference in

4

the context of this statute and it's something that

5

still troubles me, so I'm going to ask you to expand on

that.

contradiction in terms.

MR. LAYCOCK:

To say ­­ it just seems like a contradiction in

situation like that, where there ought to be plenty of

2

examples if there's a problem, they ought to have to

3

produce some of those examples.

4

So the degree of deference it is due depends

5

on the quality of their explanation, the quality of

6

their consideration of the issue, and here there's no

7

indication they ever considered the religious needs of

8

the prisoners in the adoption of this rule, or if they

9

ever took a second look at it after RLUIPA was adopted.

10

And the testimony is very conclusory, devoid of

11

examples, devoid of attention to other jurisdictions.

12

The level of deference cannot be so great as

13

to negate the statutory standard.

14

administer deference within that standard, not

15

substitute deference for the standard, and the statutory

16

standard is still compelling interest and least
