ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. KELLER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KELLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Fair Housing Act does not recognize

13

disparate­impact claims, first, because its plain text

14

doesn't use effects­ or results­based language, and when

15

a statute prohibits actions taken because of race and it

16

lacks effects­based language, the statute is limited to

17

intentional discrimination.

18

constitutional avoidance compels this interpretation.

19

Most importantly, the Act doesn't use the phrase

20

"adversely affect."

21

recognized that this effects­based phrase ­­

22

And, second, the canon of

Smith v. City of Jackson,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

At the time of Smith and

23

Griggs, neither the Title VII nor the ADEA used the

24

words "disparate impact," and yet we recognize they

25

apply disparate impact.

3
Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. KELLER:

At the time, disparate ­­ the

2

words "disparate impact" were not used; however, the

3

words "adversely affect" were used.

4

subsequently interpreted Griggs as finding the textual

5

hook for disparate­impact liability was based on the

6

phrase "adversely affect."

And Watson

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Well, you have a problem,

8

because it says "to refuse to sell or rent," et cetera,

9

"or otherwise make unavailable," and the agency charged

10

with interpreting that language has determined that it

11

means disparate impact.

12

MR. KELLER:

Justice Sotomayor, the ­­ the

13

phrase "make unavailable" is an act prohibited by the

14

Fair Housing Act.

Housing Act.

21

ADEA, where Smith said disparate impact lied.

22

like Section 4(a)(1) of the ADEA, because of the ­­

24

refusal to negotiate, otherwise making unavailable, or

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the law where it found

the other way and had said that disparate impact was a

valid action under the FHA.

you found it, and we presume that Congress knows the

law, especially when the law is that clear and that

uniform, means, yes, there will be disparate­impact

Congress could have used the same language that appeared

invitation?

5

MR. KELLER:

Justice Sotomayor, I believe

6

you're referring to Representative Swindall's amendment.

7

And the mere fact that Congress didn't enact a

provision, this Court has not looked to in reviewing a

9

statute.

10

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But what ­­ you're ­­

11

you're telling us that these amendments which said that

12

certain types of effects will not qualify, that the

13

purpose of that amendment was to prevent erroneous court

14

of appeals' decisions from affecting those particular

15

areas?

16
17
18

MR. KELLER:

Justice Scalia, that's part of

the work that they're doing.

19

for Congress to do, to believe that those court of

opinions ­­ court of appeals' opinions are wrong and yet

22

opinions are wrong, they will not apply to these things.

23

MR. KELLER:

So even though those

Well, in 1988, when Congress

was legislating, it agreed on one thing, and that was in

these three narrow circumstances, liability would be

2

restricted under the Fair Housing Act.

3

extremely odd to read into a restriction of liability a

4

recognition of a massive expansion of Fair Housing Act

5

liability, and Congress does not hide elephants in mouse

6

holes.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It would be

Exactly.

And ten

circuits had already said there was disparate impact.

9

If they didn't like the disparate­impact analysis, they

would have taken up the congressman's proposal.

they didn't.

12

MR. KELLER:

But

In the brief that the Solicitor

13

General filed in 1988, it made the point, which is

absolutely the same today, which is Congress knows how

15

to enact an effect test.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What was the reason for

You can say it's a neutral, 10 percent is neutral;

the way that they saw of getting a minority population

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Daniel, I had thought

5

that Justice Scalia's question was whether the "because

6

of" language precludes a disparate­impact theory; in

7

other words, whether the "because of" language signals

8

that it has to have a certain kind of intent which is

9

not part of a disparate treatment, a disparate­impact

10
11

theory.
And I would have thought that your main

12

argument about that is, well, actually, the Court has

13

held numerous times, in the Title VII context, in the

14

ADEA context, in the Rehabilitation Act context, in the

15

Emergency School Aid Act context, that that "because of"

16

language can be read to include disparate­impact claims,

17

and that it's at least ambiguous as to whether it should

18

be read so in this case as to this particular statute.

19

MR. DANIEL:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21
22

Yes, Justice Kagan.
I mean, is that your

argument, or is your argument something else?
MR. DANIEL:

That is the basic argument on

"because of," that it has been interpreted both ways;

of intent.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI, JR.
ON BEHALF OF UNITED STATES,
AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING RESPONDENT
GENERAL VERRILLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The statutory provisions that most clearly

22

show that HUD's disparate­impact regulations are a

23

permissible interpretation of the Fair Housing Act are

24

the three exemptions.

25

existence of disparate­impact liability and so serve no

Those exemptions presuppose the

real purpose without them ­­ without disparate­impact

2

liability.

3

And the provenance of those exemptions lends

4

particularly strong support for the reasonableness of

5

HUD's reading.

6

a time when nine, I think the number is nine courts of

7

appeals, had ruled that the Fair Housing Act authorized

8

disparate impact, and they ­­ and they were added to

9

provide defenses to exemptions from ­­ they're labeled

what I was trying to say to you, Mr. Chief Justice,

are cases in the Heartland that have been adjudicated

Second, and I don't mean to be flip about it

3

we do have the reg now and I do think it gets Chevron

5

I think that's

And if I could turn to the question of

6

avoidance, constitutional avoidance, that has come up.

7

I don't think this is a suitable case for constitutional

8

avoidance, and let me try to explain why.

9

might think in the Title VII context about the

Whatever one

10

consequences of finding disparate­impact liability, this

11

is a very different context.

12

the issue has been raised is that the only way to avoid

13

disparate­impact liability is to engage in race­based

14

remedies, not race­based thinking about what neutral

15

criterion to adopt, but race­based remedies.

16

In a Title VII context,

And here in the Heartland cases under the

17

Fair Housing Act, you aren't going to have that kind of

18

an issue.

19

one race­neutral rule for another race­neutral rule.

20

For example, if a ­­ if a landlord cannot justify an

21

occupancy restriction that's particularly tight, the ­­

22

the remedy there is going to be either no occupancy

23

restriction or a looser occupancy restriction.

25

The remedy is going to be the substitution of

that no one gets classified by race, no one gets a

2

burden imposed upon them because of race, and no one

What ­­ what rule you

kind of consideration, so long as the ­­ the rule that

14

comes later is a race­neutral rule, seems to me is

exactly the kind of thing that the plurality opinion of

such things the Court suggested as changing the bonding

5

GENERAL VERRILLI:

And so in the Heartland

6

cases, with respect to the Fair Housing Act, the kinds

7

of remedies that are going to be imposed are like the

8

kinds of remedies that the Court said ­­ or the

9

plurality, excuse me, set in Croson would find.

something Justice Breyer said.

8

If there are particular instances in which

9

there is a concern that the recognition of disparate

10

impact liability could result in not just race­based

11

thinking about neutral means but race­based remedies, it

12

seems to me the answer there is the answer that the

13

Court usually gives, which is think about them on an

14

as­applied basis.

15

denying HUD the authority that we submit that HUD has

16

under ­­ under the regulations ­­ under the statute as

17

amended in 1988 when Congress specifically gave HUD the

authority to interpret these provisions and did so

19

against the backdrop of imposing the exemptions which

20

presupposed disparate impact liability and reenacting

21

the statute in which, after nine courts of appeals had

22

found that it did impose disparate impact liability.

23

The question here is whether under Chevron the statutory

24

text read fairly in 1988, taking all provisions of the

Justice Alito, to your point about Smith and

4

the ADA's reasonable factors other than age exemptions,

5

there are three things that distinguish that from this

6

case.

7

The ADA's reasonable factor other than age provision

8

referred to actions otherwise prohibited.

9

in Smith interpreted that as recognizing the disparate

First, there's an important textual difference.

And the Court

10

impact liability could lie under the ADA.

In the Fair

11

Housing Act, we don't have that language.

The

12

exemptions say nothing in the FHA prohibits or limits.

13

So this is truly a safe harbor.

14

Second, Smith already noted that the ADA

15

used adversely effect.

16

race and so no constitutional avoidance can and would

17

have applied there.

18

And third, Smith didn't involve

And on constitutional avoidance, the reason

19

we're here today is because the Texas department did not

20

use race­based decision­making.

21

from Gruder.

22

the incoming class must have 30 percent of its incoming

23

class of a certain race and we prefer that

24

race­conscious or race­neutral means were used to do

25

that, but if those aren't available, race­based means

Take a hypothetical

2

all we need to show is a constitutional doubt for the

constitutional avoidance canon to apply here and the

remedy said that there was one.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. KELLER:

At the very least

What in the remedy
What remedy said you have

The particular remedy here

wasn't race­based, but the liability to begin with and

10

whether the disparity is going to close and whether the

11

Department is going to remain not in compliance with the

12

Fair Housing Act, is still race­based.

13

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
