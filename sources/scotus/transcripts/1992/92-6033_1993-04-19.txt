ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN E. SHOENBERGER

We'll hear argument

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHOENBERGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case today is a single one,

11

whether or not Mr. McNeil can have his day in court on the

12

merits in the case he alleged.

13

experimentation for AIDS and hepatitis purposes without

14

his consent.

15

funded the research on male prisoners, but claims that the

16

research was done on him voluntarily.

17

His suit alleges

The Government answered agreeing that it had

We believe the Court can answer the question

18

presented in this case without reaching all of the many

19

questions presented in the briefs in this case.

20

particular, we believe the case can be answered on the

21

argument that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure rule 15(d)

22

means that he perfected his March, 1989 filing by the

23

August, 1989 letter for filing that he sent to the court.

24

That appears in the Joint Appendix on page 10.

25

The case is not about exhaustion.

In

Mr. McNeil

1

clearly exhausted the Federal administrative remedies.

2

Indeed, we think he at least exhausted it twice, but

3

certainly he exhausted it once and got a letter from the

4

Federal Government saying that he had a right to sue.

5

However, the case is rather complicated on its

6

facts and I would like to run through a number of those

7

major facts to show the events.

8

9

The case began when he filed, in at least
January of 1989, an administrative claim.

In that same

10

month, a letter was sent by the administrative agency

11

saying that his administrative claim, which it was

12

labeled, was being sent to a claims officer.

13

told that if the case was not settled, he would have to

14

bring a lawsuit.

15

And he was

In February of 1989, he received another letter

16

from that same administrative agency, this letter saying

17

that no records could be found to indicate that such

18

experimentation had been conducted with the Federal

19

Government being involved.

20

After those two letters, Mr. McNeil believed,

21

apparently, that he had an obligation to sue or his rights

22

would be lost.

23

included with that suit a motion for leave to proceed in

24

forma pauperis.

25

He brought suit in March of 1989 and

QUESTION:

1

Let me stop you there.

Now, do you

2

say that his claim was actually denied in writing?

3

so, which letter do we look to?

4

MR. SHOENBERGER:

5

that his claim was denied.
QUESTION:

6

do we look to as a denial?

8

MR. SHOENBERGER:

9

He believes or he believed

What is your position?

7

And if

What letter

You look to -- he believed

that the combination of the January 24th letter and the

10

February -- I believe it's 9th letter, put together, were

11

a denial of his claim.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SHOENBERGER:

14

position.

15
16
17

Is that your position on his behalf?
That is certainly a reasonable

I believe a stronger position -QUESTION:

Well, is it your position on his

behalf?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

It's part of our --my

18

position on his behalf.

19

the stronger position is that the August filing, the

20

letter that was contained in August, certainly constituted

21

an adequate filing for purposes of this suit.

22

QUESTION:

I think the better position or

But if we go this far, because that's

23

where we are chronologically, you say that the two

24

letters, somehow combined, are a denial.

25

certainly wasn't the passage of 6 months, was there?

QUESTION:

MR. SHOENBERGER:

10
11

there was the passage

March.

7

there was by August of 1989,

There was

of 6 months.

4
5

That's correct.

6 months had not elapsed.

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So you would have to say somehow

those two letters were a denial.

12

MR. SHOENBERGER:

That's -- that was clearly

13

what he believed.

As a pro se litigant, he clearly

14

believed that and he clearly articulated that to the

15

Seventh Circuit in his reply brief.
QUESTION:

16

But, we're -- Mr. Shoenberger, we're

17

talking really a question of law here, not what someone

18

may have reasonably believed, unless the law makes what

19

someone reasonably believed,

20

was,

rather than what actually

relevant.

21

MR. SHOENBERGER:

22

QUESTION:

I agree, Your Honor.

Then why do you keep mentioning your

23

client's reasonable belief in something?

24

does the statute give any reason why reasonable belief

25

should be important?

6

(800) FOR DEPO

Does the law --

1

MR. SHOENBERGER:

The statute on its text

2

neither refers to reasonable belief -- nor does the

3

statute, we believe, in its text indicate the remedy that

4

should occur should a premature filing, if this is deemed

5

a premature filing -- had been made.

6

So the text is absent that would answer this

7

case, except for Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, rule

8

15(d), which explicitly speaks to the case and we believe

9

explicitly cures any defect that might have been made in

10

11

the original filing.
QUESTION:

Well, but if one were to read the

12

text of 2675(a), which is one of the statutes with you,

13

"an action shall not be instituted upon a claim against

14

the United States for money damages unless the claimant

15

shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate

16

Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally

17

denied by the agency in writing."

18

That suggests that whatever you - - whatever you

19

filed in March simply was not -- was not permissible under

20

the statute because "an action shall not be instituted."

21

22

MR. SHOENBERGER:

course, whether "instituted" means the same as commenced.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SHOENBERGER:

25

Well, what --we contest, of

Well -But he believed that he had

his denial, and the statute is only clear if you look at

1

the method it specifies for notifying the denial, which

2

refers to certified or registered mail.

3

Unfortunately, Mr. McNeil was a prisoner, and as

4

a practical matter unless a letter includes within its

5

text a reference to certified or registered mail, he would

6

not know whether or not the letter was certified or

7

registered, because that kind of documentation does not

8

normally come forward to prisoners, at least in most of

9

the prisons that I'm aware of.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SHOENBERGER:

12

13
14
15

Well -And so he had --he had a gap

in knowledge.
QUESTION:

Well, was the letter which he

received -- was it certified or registered?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

The record does not indicate

16

whether either the January, 1989 letter or the February,

17

1989 letter were either registered or certified.

18
19
20
21

22

QUESTION:

Was this point raised by you in the

district court?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

I did not represent him in the

district court.
QUESTION:

Was it raised by whoever represented

23

him in the district court?

24

MR. SHOENBERGER:

25

QUESTION:

He represented himself pro se.

Was it raised by him?

3

MR. SHOENBERGER:

He did raise the argument that

he had made a sufficient filing -QUESTION:

I'm asking you a very specific

4

question, Mr. Shoenberger, and I think it's capable of

5

being answered yes or no.

6

MR. SHOENBERGER:

I believe he did assert

7

specifically that he had notice in March of 1989 in

8

connection with these two letters that allowed him the

9

right --a permission to sue.

10
11
12

13

He said that specifically

to the Federal district court.
QUESTION:

In - -

Well, so he wasn't contending there,

then, that the mailing he received was inadequate.
MR. SHOENBERGER:

No.

I think he thought the

14

mailings were adequate to inform him that the Federal

15

Government had said his claim was denied.

16

QUESTION:

Well then are you -- are you here

17

making a - - I thought from what you remarked a moment ago

18

that you are here making a point that because there was - -

19

there's no evidence the denial was sent by certified or

20

regisetered mail, that that has some bearing on it.

21

MR. SHOENBERGER:

In the August,

1989 filing

22

that he made,

23

litigation, attached to that letter -- that letter was the

24

sum certain denial that was sent in July of 1989.

25

internally, that says that it was sent by certified mail,

in his letter requesting to commence the

And

1

return receipt requested.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SHOENBERGER:

4

Well
That is, the letter contained

that particular language.

5

QUESTION:

Do you make a point here of your

6

claim that the denial from the agency was not sent by

7

certified or registered mail?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

8

9
10

That as far as we know, in

August -- in July of 1989 it was sent by certified mail,
because that's what the letter says.
QUESTION:

11

And am I right in thinking you make

12

no point of failure to certify or register here, in your

13

case here?

14

MR. SHOENBERGER:

We certainly don't, because

15

there's no evidence in the record -- and the only evidence

16

in the record would seem to suggest it was, but we don't

17

know that as a fact.

18

know that as a fact, can't know that as a fact by the way

19

mail is processed in the prison.

20

And as I said, Mr. McNeil doesn't

But in any case, the Government, as we

21

understand it, agrees that that July, 1989 letter was a

22

sum certain denial.

record and any of the briefs that have come up on appeal,

24

either in the Seventh Circuit or in briefs to this Court.

25

However, rule -- rule 15(d), it seems to us, is

We think that's uncontroverted in the

1

a completely adequate way of dealing with the particular

2

problem.

3

to the Joint Appendix, page 10, that's his August filing.

4

And that filing in its text seems quite clear.

5

If I could ask your Court -- the Court to refer

It says he got his second sum certain denial,

6

which was attached to that -- it's the July, 1989 sum

7

certain denial.

8

second text, second denial, to the Federal district court.

9

It also states he was, in fact, infected with hepatitis.

And it's -- he says he's sending that

10

It tells the court that he had paid the filing fee for the

11

case in May of 1989, although in June of 1989 the Federal

12

district court did not apparently know that and stayed all

13

further proceedings until it ruled on the in forma

14

pauperis motion.

15

There were a number of documents that apparently

16

were mislaid in Mr. McNeil's case by the Federal district

17

court.

18

QUESTION:

Well, now, you don't take the

19

position, do you, that the August 7th letter is a

20

complaint - -

21

MR. SHOENBERGER:

QUESTION:

No.

1

different ways.

2

that perfects the original March filing, or,

3

alternatively, that it is, in fact, a complaint under

4

Haines v. Kerner, to be construed liberally in terms of

5

its text.

6

That it's a proper rule 15(d) supplement

So that on either of those grounds - - if you

7

find for Mr. McNeil on either of those grounds, the case

8

was validly -- was validly filed and perfected, either

9

filed in August of 1989 or perfected in August of 1989,

10

and that he has an ability to go forward with the suit.

11

QUESTION:

Well, is there anything to indicate

12

that the district court acted to grant this implied motion

13

under 15 -- under rule 15(d)?

14

MR. SHOENBERGER:

There is no indication that

15

the Federal district court ever saw this letter of August

16

7th and the attachments.

17

opinion at the district court level that it was ever paid

18

any attention to, and so the answer to that is no.

19

QUESTION:

There is no reference in the

Well, it's rather odd to rely, then,

20

on an implied motion that the district court has not even

21

seen, much less acted on - -

sentence,

"plaintiff prays this Honorable court accepts

2

this letter as a proper request, whereas plaintiff can

3

properly commence his legal action accordingly."

4

If -- and we disagree.

If the word "commenced"

5

is the same as the word "instituted" -- that's the word in

6

2675 -- and both of those words mean filed, if the

7

statutory language is to bear that interpretation, his

8

letter should bear that same interpretation, being in the

9

same context.

And that means that this particular last

10

sentence or last half sentence should be interpreted as

MR. SHOENBERGER:

If the -- if commencing means

18

filed, if that's the statutory interpretation from 2675

19

that's correct.
QUESTION:

20

Yeah, but it says it "can properly

It says, "whereas plaintiff can properly

MR. SHOENBERGER:

2

Well, I think -- I think his

3

subjective intent may very well have been that he simply

wanted the prior filing to start going forward.

5

was a layperson and he certainly had no great familiarity

6

with rule 15(d).

We think it's a question

that's a subsidiary question to the one that was presented

The question is whether or not

Your question presented in your brief is whether

an incomplete filing of a Federal Tort Claims Act --an

considered a proper complaint, but by filing a notice of

Your second question is may the United States

14

bar a suit when the pro se prisoner files a premature suit

15

but satisfies the congressional requirement by filing a

final agency denial prior to substantial progress.

Now, that is a significant legal issue on which

there's dispute around the country.

MR. SHOENBERGER:

In a number of the examples

cited by the solicitor general's office, which we discuss

5

in the reply brief on page 8 and 9, the word "institute"

6

is used, in these cases, in the same statutory sections

different than the word "commenced" when Congress is using

Mr. Shoenberger, as I understand your

MR. SHOENBERGER:

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Why does

Well, as a practical matter,

20

if Congress was concerned with conserving the governmental

21

resources, we think that purpose is disserved by letting a

Now, the Court should also not overlook the

As the Court stated in Hallstrom, positions
become hardened once litigation is initiated, and
settlement becomes less likely.

More practically, FTCA

cases for the Government are litigated typically by the
U.S. Attorneys offices, and the administrative claims
process is cut off by the filing of a lawsuit.
The statute itself provides that.

Section 2672

gives the head of the concerned agency the authority to
settle a case prior to litigation being filed, subject to
regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.

Section

2677 lodges that authority to settle in the Attorney
General after a lawsuit is filed.

It is entirely a

An agency cannot, on its own, settle a

QUESTION:

Does that mean that at the time this

man wrote his letter to the agency, the agency really
didn't have any authority to settle?
MR. KELLEY:

Well, on - - these facts are

somewhat unusual, Justice Stevens, because the agency did
not have notice that the lawsuit had been filed.

I

suppose, as an abstract matter, that would be correct,
although the Attorney General's regulations respecting
settlement of administrative claims do not specifically
state that they may not settle claims after a lawsuit is

The structure of the statute suggests that and

in the administrative process the way it works, as a

4

practical matter, is that once a case is filed and we

I don't believe

So I'll just say I don't know.

The statute is plain.

Mr. McNeil, as is reflected by his pro se

And I would actually have to say

And he -- he made a mistake.
Now, section 2678 of the statute, which deals

11

with the extent of allowed attorneys fees in these cases,

12

which is reprinted in the appendix to our brief, also

13

confirms that there is a big difference between

14

pre-litigation settlement and post-litigation settlement.

15

Under that statute, a settlement pursuant to section 2672,

16

that is the pre-litigation settlement by the agency, is --

17

allows an attorney to collect a contingency fee of up to

18

25 percent of the award.

19

That section also says, however, that once a

20

lawsuit is filed and a case is settled pursuant to section

21

2677, the percentage of the allowable attorneys fee is

22

reduced to 20 percent, and that is a criminal penalty if a

23

lawyer violates that.

24
25

So this all goes to the point that it's
important to have a bright line here.

We believe that it

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I believe through inadvertence, there was a

misstatement of the 20 percent and 25 percent attorneys

fees.

14

think the difference between 20 percent, if you can settle

15

out of court, and 25 percent is enough to encourage

16

attorneys to go ahead and try to avoid the administrative

process, as a practical matter.

It's 25 percent if you go to court, and we don't
