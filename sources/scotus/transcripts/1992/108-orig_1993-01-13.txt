ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF WYOMING
MR. COOK:

10

Thank you, Mr . Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

'

We're here today on exceptions to the Special

12

Master's recommendations on cross motions for partial

13

summary judgment in an original action this Court accepted

14

i n 1987.

It was filed in 1986.

15

What makes this case important to more than the

16

parties before you here today is that these cross motions

17

for summary judgment provide the opportunity for the Court

18

to demonstrate the proper application of summary judgment

19

as a procedural tool to secure a just, speedy, and

20

inexpensive determination of this original case.

21

To follow the Special Master's recommendations

22

here will be to accept a view of sumrnary judgment that is

23

incompatible with the Court's decision in Anderson v.

24

Liberty Lobby, Celotex v. Catrett, and National Wildlife

25

Federation v. Luj an.

The Special Master in this case indicates at the

2

outset of his Second Interim Report that he has followed

3

the Court's dictates with regard to the sununary judgment

The specific issue to be addressed at this point

8

is the appropriateness of ruling on whether Nebraska's as-

9

interest downstream of Tri-State will be material to

11

whether Wyoming or Colorado has violated Nebraska's

apportionment.

case and the provisions for which her evidence will be

At this stage, however, it is premature to

Reading the Court's summary judgment decisions,

17

I do not believe that there's a fair reading of those

18

decisions that would allow this recommendation not to

19

decide, but to allow Nebraska more time yet to determine

20

if it has a case, to grope along for another 6 years,

21

possibly, to determine if it has a case.

Then by way of

sununary judgment motions, Wyoming asks the logical and

3

unavoidable legal question of whether those four specific

acts do in fact violate the decree.

It involves simply reading the North Platte

decree was final in 1945, it is a clear and unambiguous

has it been asked to amend the decree by Nebraska, has the

Court agreed to consider such an amendment of the decree

4

and then, if both of those tests have been met, now, on

5

summary judgment, when Wyoming moves to pierce their

6

pleadings, has Nebraska come forward with evidence that

7

would support a finding in their favor, and that evidence

would have to support a finding by clear and convincing

evidence that an injunction is necessary to protect some

consideration of this case to review those two affidavits

Mr. Becker specifically told -- in his March 1

affidavit indicated that, after analyzing the Deer Creek

Downstream, or upstream from Tri-State, Nebraska
has large rights in the water.

It derives water from

10

storage rights, from reservoirs that have been built

11

upstream for the benefit of Nebraska, and it also has

12

specifically allocated to it within the decree various

13

canals and the ability to draw water from those canals.

14

What Nebraska seeks in this case is apparently

15

the ability to go beyond what has been decreed to it and

16

to introduce evidence about various equities that have

17

developed, equities developing from the fact that it has

18

had excess water beyond the limited amount that it is

19

given in the decree, and that because of that extra

20

benefit it has had through the years, it has developed

21

equities in reliance on that excess water.

circumvent the limited nature of the enforcement action in

operational practice of the Bureau, and I think it's

concluding that the issues were not yet ripe for

The Special Master's reconunendations on those

light of his familiarity with the record of this case, a

record that is still being developed.

recommended that this Court should deny summary judgment

There are two critical considerations with

First, Wyoming's argument that

this matter is controlled by the Laramie decree is

20

untenable, because that decree only apportions flow down

and what's more, when this Court in 1945 apportioned the

2

North Platte, it included those Laramie inflows -- the

3

post-Wheatland Laramie inflows as part of that pool of

4

water between Whalen and Tri-State that's divided up among

the States, and again, it is a central assumption that

went into the apportionment in this case.

7

Now, Special Master Olpin correctly concluded

that since the North Platte water supply that this Court

Laramie contributions, Nebraska has a right to seek relief

If Deer Creek is
