ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY CAMINSKY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. CAMINSKY:

For the last seven or eight

10

hundred years, the writ of habeas corpus has been one of

11

the Crown Jewels in Anglo-American jurisprudence,

12

providing a measure of protection for all who share the

13

heritage of the English common law from tyranny and

14

oppression.

15

In this case, I submit to the Court that we have

16

in front of us today a classic example of the extent to

17

which habeas corpus has strayed from its original and

18

intended purposes and gives us a paradigm of a Federal

19

district court employing a writ of habeas corpus as a writ

20

of Federal error.

21

If we take a look at the record of this case, we

22

see that before his arraignment respondent made three

23

separate statements to the police, the first statement

24

being severable into two separate parts, a pre-Miranda

25

segment and a post-Miranda segment.

Prior to trial, the respondent moved to suppress
all three statements on various grounds relating to the
Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, and actuallyprevailed concerning two of those statements.
The only statement that the State trial judge
admitted into evidence was the first statement rejecting
the respondent's claim that it was obtained unlawfully and
in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights.
In a State court appeal, the respondent chose to
appeal on matters relating to this particular statement
only on grounds related to the Miranda issue.

The State

Court of Appeals in Michigan denied his appeal and issued
an opinion affirming his conviction.

The respondent then

filed an application to the Michigan Supreme Court which
denied review and ultimately filed a petition for writ of
certiorari to this Court which was denied back in 1989.
Respondent then went to Federal district court,
filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.

Again, as

far as this particular statement is concerned, respondent
raised only the Miranda issue.
In her opinion granting the writ, however, the
Federal district judge not only sustained his Miranda
claim, in effect overruling the finding of the State court
that the police had done nothing wrong, but also went on
to find the second half of that statement, the post4

Miranda statement, and actually both of the other
statements that had been suppressed in the State trial
court, to be involuntary.
We appealed to the Sixth Circuit, and while
finding parts of the district court's opinion slightly
inexplicable, the court nevertheless issued an opinion
affirming, and that is what brings us here today.
QUESTION:

Did you complain in the Fifth

Circuit, Mr. Caminsky, about the district court's taking
up the involuntariness issue as well as the Miranda issue?
MR. CAMINSKY:

Yes, we did.

In fact, in the

Sixth Circuit I tried to draw a clear distinction between
the Miranda claim and a claim of involuntariness.

I think

there are clear precedents from this Court under the
Quarles case and Harris v. New York and a number of others
where this Court has drawn a distinction between Miranda
defects and Miranda claims and claims of involuntariness,
and that was one of the things that I tried to point out
in the Sixth Circuit, apparently not as well as I would
have hoped, because in any event they rejected that
particular position, and in fact -QUESTION:

More specifically, though --

MR. CAMINSKY:
QUESTION:

Yes.

Did you object that the

involuntariness claim had never been raised in the

district court?
MR. CAMINSKY:

Yes.

We -- in a number of points

wf'

3

in our brief, what we tried to do was draw a distinction

4

between the Miranda claim and the involuntariness claim,

5

and we even noted in our brief in the Sixth Circuit that

6

this issue was not before the district court not only

7

because of the failure of exhaustion but because it had

8

never been raised in the petition for writ of certiorari,

9

so it is a little bit mystifying how we got to the point

10

of having to argue both the question of voluntariness and

11

the question of Miranda.

12

The Sixth Circuit, however, also drew no

13

distinction between the Miranda claim and the

14

involuntariness claim, and that is one of the points that

15

we're here to address today.

16

In fact, it seems to me that in many respects

17

the narrowest holding that this Court could issue, and

18

perhaps the core of this case, is simply the application

19

of Stone v. Powell to Miranda claims, and there are a

20

number of different ways this Court can go about that.

21
22

QUESTION:

Well, is one of your questions in

your petition the failure to exhaust?

23

MR. CAMINSKY:

24

I think in terms of helping the analysis, it may

Yes, it is.

help us to divide what we commonly consider to be

constitutional claims into three different

2

classifications, three different classes of claimed

constitutional violations.

4

The first claim would be matters of fundamental

5

fairness.

6

rather interesting opinion outlining his conception of

7

what fundamental fairness was, and basically this Court

8

has issued opinions of similar import in recent years.

9

Justice Cardozo in Palko v. Connecticut wrote a

Teague v. Lane, for example, would even apply

10

retroactive changes in the law in habeas review in certain

11

cases relating -QUESTION:

12

Well, if you really raised the

13

exhaustion claim and we agreed with you, why, that would

14

be the end of the case, wouldn't it?
MR. CAMINSKY:

15

No.

There would still be the

16

Miranda claim to deal with.

17

only refers to the second half --

QUESTION:

19

MR. CAMINSKY:

20

I mean, the exhaustion claim

Yeah. Yeah.
Of the statement, so as far as

that is concerned, that would be the -QUESTION:

Well, I don't know that I see the --

well, I guess I can read your questions as well as you

can.

1

MR. CAMINSKY:

See, this is one of the points of

2

some confusion in the Sixth Circuit.

3

examines the Sixth Circuit Appendix it will see that the

4

respondent in his State court appeal appeared through his

5

statement of the question to be raising only a question of

6

the State constitution.

7

If the Court

At the time in Michigan there was a question

8

relating to focus and custody in terms of triggering

9

mechanism for Miranda warnings, and in large part his

10

argument in the State court related to that issue, and I

11

had originally challenged the Miranda claim on the

12

question of exhaustion as well.

13

seemed that there was enough language in his State court

14

appellate brief to raise the Federal part of the Miranda

15

issue as well, and therefore I think that part of it is

16

exhausted.

Upon reflection, it

17

But I would - - I would - -

18

QUESTION:

19

You think Stone v. Powell covers this

case.

20

MR. CAMINSKY:

Yes, I do, for a number of

21

reasons.

22

particular classification that Miranda would fall into,

23

and we have questions of fundamental fairness of basic due

24

process.

25

I mean, part of the reason is because of the

1

be the Federal criminal constitutional procedural- type

2

guarantees that this Court has adopted through its

3

incorporation document.

4

The last class would be constitutional claims

5

relating to rules of deterrence, or rules of peripheral

6

access, and that is the type of claim that Miranda is, and

7

it seems to me that if you take the logic of Stone v.

8

Powell and apply it to the particular fact situations that

9

are likely to occur in a Miranda case, that the legal

10

11

parallels are rather compelling.
And in fact, as Justice O'Connor noted in her

12

concurring opinion in Duckworth, it seems to be even more

13

compelling in the Miranda context because we're not really

14

dealing with an actual violation of the Constitution,

15

we're simply dealing with a violation of the rule that

16

this Court has designed to create a buffer around the

17

actual constitutional violation.

18

QUESTION:

Isn't there a very pragmatic

19

difference, though, because in the Fourth Amendment case,

20

if you preclude the litigation of these claims that's it,

21

it's all over, whereas if we preclude litigation in the

22

Miranda claims we then face the voluntariness claim.

MR. CAMINSKY:

It's not over.

wind up having to face that claim anyway.

experience, it is the --

3

QUESTION:

In my

Well, it will face that case anyway

4

if the Miranda point is lost, but if the Miranda point is

5

won, it doesn't face that claim --

6

MR. CAMINSKY:

7

QUESTION:

Well --

So the -- I guess what my question

8

boils down to is, assuming you win, every case that -- at

9

least -- and I'm talking on pragmatic grounds here.

Every

10

case that would readily have been disposed of will now

11

turn into a case of much more complicated litigation over

12

voluntariness and I question -- even if one were inclined

13

to accept your view in the abstract, I question what we

14

would be gaining by it, or indeed losing by it.

15

MR. CAMINSKY:

Well, Your Honor, I suppose that

16

reasonable minds can differ in terms of our perception of

17

the practical benefits.

18

defendants are always raising both issues.

19

treat them as twins and see how the factual record

20

develops and argue the point from there.

21

QUESTION:

In my experience, it seems that
They tend to

It seems --

Would you concede that in this case

22

there certainly is a voluntariness issue which will be

23

litigated, is litigated?

24
25

MR. CAMINSKY:

There was a voluntariness issue

that could have been litigated.

If the Court, however,

1

examines the record and examines the tapes, it will see we

2

are not talking about the kind of voluntariness issue that

3

we discussed -- the Court discussed in Mincey, for

4

example, or in Brown v. Mississippi, where you're talking

5

about actual -- overt acts of physical coercion.

6

I mean, if there is a voluntariness issue, it is

7

rather - - rather odd that it not only passed by the

8

defense attorneys in the State court, but it completely

9

escaped the attention of anybody up until it was raised

10
11

sua sponte by the Federal district judge.
QUESTION:

Do we have any way of gauging the

12

practical effect of ruling your way?

13

to do this based on our own educated guesses from our own

14

backgrounds?

15

MR. CAMINSKY:

Probably.

I mean, do we have

I'm not aware of any

16

particular studies.

17

considerable number of Miranda claims, but in any event,

18

if the Court looks to the text of the habeas statute it

19

does not talk about issuing the writ in cases where there

is a violation of a prophylactic rule.

MR. CAMINSKY:

QUESTION:

MR. CAMINSKY:

Well --

Miranda claims?
I think that a very strong

4

argument can be made along those lines.

5

different question to be raised --

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CAMINSKY:

Do you want to rest on that argument?
No.

I think there's a -- there

8

is a distinction to be made between direct appeal and

9

habeas review.

10

I mean, habeas review historically has been a

11

rather limited mechanism for correcting fundamental

12

injustice, and in this type of case, if you are dealing

13

with Miranda claims you are not necessarily dealing with a

14

fundamental injustice.

15

opinion, the mere failure to give warnings does not render

16

evidence inherently suspect or inherently unreliable.

17

As Justice O'Connor noted in her

In addition, we permit the use of Miranda-

18

defective confessions for impeachment purposes and for a

19

variety of other purposes as well, so we are not dealing

20

with a class of evidence that is by its nature excludable,

21

we are dealing with a very limited class of evidence that

22

creates a buffer around the actual core constitutional

23

right that's involved.

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think the Miranda

6

rule plays a role in preventing the extraction of possibly

7

involuntary confessions?

8
9

MR. CAMINSKY:

I think it very well may in a

number of different cases.

10

QUESTION:

Do you agree that there's some sense

11

in thinking that involuntary confessions may be

12

unreliable?
MR. CAMINSKY:

13

Oh, I don't believe that any real

14

civilized system of justice could rely on involuntary

15

confessions at all.

16

QUESTION:

Well, so the Miranda rules do play a

17

role in preventing the introduction of possibly unreliable

18

statements.
MR. CAMINSKY:

19

In certain cases, Your Honor.

I

20

mean, what the Miranda rules do is create a buffer around

21

the right.

22

QUESTION:

Now, Stone against Powell has just --

23

Stone against Powell, the Fourth Amendment cases don't

24

have anything to do with a possible reliability,

unreliability of the result reached at the trial.

MR. CAMINSKY:

MR. CAMINSKY:

Anyway, perhaps I can make the point better by

8

way of illustration.

limit on most interstates, and if that is what the law is

10

supposed to be, if the police decide that that law is so

11

important that they simply do not wish to allow anybody to

12

exceed the speed limit, if they adopt a rule that they'll

13

issue tickets every time somebody goes more than 40 miles

14

an hour, you're going to have a great number of people who

15

are issued tickets for exceeding the de facto 40-mile-an-

16

hour speed limit but never actually reach the status of a

17

violation of the law.

18

We have a 65-mile-an-hour speed

It seems to me that the Miranda case -- the

19

Miranda rule deals with situations falling in that buffer

20

as between the 40 and 65-mile-an-hour range.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

7

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

8

MR. ROBERTS:

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
The United States believes that the rule of

10
11

Stone v. Powell should apply to bar the assertion of

12

Miranda claims on habeas corpus if the habeas petitioner

13

has had a full and fair opportunity to raise the claim in

14

State court for the same reasons that the rule bars the

15

assertion of exclusionary rule claims on habeas corpus.

16

Like the exclusionary rule, the requirement of

17

Miranda warnings is an extraconstitutional, judicially-

18

created rule.

19

admission of probative evidence to deter Fourth Amendment

20

violations, Miranda bars the admission of probative

21

statements to deter Fifth Amendment violations, and

Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

Okay.

MR. ROBERTS:

10

We don't challenge its application

in trial or on direct review.

12

QUESTION:

But just a Miranda rule is the law of

13

the United States within the meaning of the habeas corpus

14

statute.

15

MR. ROBERTS:

I don't think the phrase,

16

Constitution laws and treaties, laws can include both

17

statutes and judicially-created constitutional common law,

18

as it were.

19

QUESTION:

I understand.

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

Is your answer yes?

Yes, and as the Court

21

explained in Stone that there's little additional

22

deterrent effect from applying the exclusionary rule on

23

habeas corpus, so, too, there is little, if any,

24

additional deterring effect from applying Miranda.

You have no disagreement with the

We agree with that.

don't

4
5

No.

Yes.
It is a factor to be considered in

the totality of the circumstances, yes.
QUESTION:

9

So if we adopted your rule, we would

10

be inquiring into whether or not the Miranda warning had

11

been given and its effect in any event in all those

12

voluntariness cases.
MR. ROBERTS:

3

Well, it would be one of the

4

factors to be considered.

5

question.

6

This goes to Justice Souter's

We think there's a very significant gain from

7

excluding Miranda from habeas corpus.

8

from its own Miranda jurisprudence that cases under

9

Miranda can present very difficult technical issues -- the

20

content of the warnings, when they're triggered, how they

21

apply to subsequent arrests.

22

This Court knows

In cases that the Court knows seldom present

23

serious issues of voluntariness under the Fifth Amendment,

24

No.

Do you have any

No, I don't.

I think the key distinction that the respondent

Fourth Amendment and Miranda's exclusionary rule is that

the exclusionary rule doesn't prevent a constitutional

violation from occurring.

That's complete upon the

16

Miranda, on the other hand, respondent argues,

17

prevents a constitutional violation from even occurring,

18

and is therefore worth pursuing even on habeas corpus.

19

That, I think, begs the question.

It assumes

20

there's a Fifth Amendment violation to be deterred, to be

21

prevented.

22

As this Court has explained, a violation of

23

Miranda is not the same as a violation of the Fifth

Amendment, and once that's understood, the distinction

cuts the other way.

2

constitutional violation in every case in which it

3

applies.

4

Miranda sweeps more broadly than the

Constitution, so we think the rule of Stone v. Powell

should apply a fortiori, and with respect to the

significance, the practical impact, it's noteworthy I

8

think that 36 State Attorneys General have filed an amicus

brief in this case suggesting that they regard the impact

as significant in terms of the respect accorded by the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

7

MR. WAXMAN:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it

please the Court:
All four Federal judges who have considered this

8

case have concluded that a writ of habeas corpus must

9

issue in Mr. Williams' favor for two independent reasons.

10

First, because the prosecution introduced at his trial as

11

evidence of guilt statements Mr. Williams made in response

12

to custodial police interrogation prior to receiving any

13

Miranda warnings, and second, independently, because the

14

prosecution also introduced at trial statements

15

Mr. Williams made in response to custodial interrogation

16

by -- which were elicited by means which rendered them

17

involuntary under the totality of the circumstances.

18

Unless this Court overturns both of those

19

rulings, a writ of habeas corpus must issue and

20

Mr. Williams must be given a new trial.

21

The Miranda issue in this case is simply whether

22

the rule announced by this Court in Stone v. Powell should

23

be extended to claims that a petitioner's rights under

24

Miranda v. Arizona were violated.

25

QUESTION:

That's not how the question is phrased.

that there is no challenge in this Court -QUESTION:

Well, I know, but I take it that

7

if -- say we thought that Stone v. Powell was completely

8

different from this case, it would still be open to us to

9

say but nevertheless we should say that the Miranda claims

10

11

aren't open on habeas.
MR. WAXMAN:

Certainly, Your Honor, if this

12

Court were to conclude that Federal courts had no

13

jurisdiction to hear Miranda claims, it could and must

14

reach such a conclusion.

15

My first point is that there was no challenge,

16

though -- there is no challenge in this Court to any

17

aspects of the merits of the Miranda rulings below, and in

18

our view the rule announced in Stone v. Powell should not

19

and cannot be applied to violations of Miranda's

20

constitutional rules.

21

The rights protected by the Fifth Amendment

22

privilege against self -incrimination are so unlike those

23

under the Fourth Amendment, and the relationship of

24

Miranda to the privilege is so different than the

25

relationship between Mapp and the Fourth Amendment, that

the concerns that inform this Court's decision in' Stone

2

and, we submit, no other concerns counsel favoring

3

extension of that rule to Miranda claims.

4

factors counsel against extending the rule in Stone to

5

Miranda.

Indeed, those

I'd like to briefly give the reasons why, and

6

7

then explain in more detail why I say this.

8

because in complete contrast to the Fourth Amendment

9

exclusionary rule, Miranda is specifically designed to and

First,

10

does both prevent the constitutional violation from

11

occurring and, if a violation does occur, it redresses the

12

constitutional injury.

3

Second, unlike Stone, which reduce the burden on

4

Federal courts and friction with State courts by taking

5

Federal courts completely out of the business of

6

adjudicating the constitutionality of the admission of

7

physical evidence, depriving Federal habeas courts of the

8

power to adjudicate Miranda claims will produce no such

9

result, and third, unlike the Fourth Amendment

20

exclusionary rule, Miranda is not unrelated to fairness

21

and reliability at trial.
Before I elaborate on those three points, I

22

23

would like to stress two points which I think are very

24

fundamental in this case, one about Stone and one about

25

Miranda.
28

Stone v. Powell is not a decision about the

1

2

scope of the habeas corpus statute, it is a decision about

3

the scope of the judge-made exclusionary rule designed to

4

reinforce the Fourth Amendment.

5

very clear, and this important distinction is apparent and

6

reiterated in all of this Court's subsequent decisions

7

that have declined to extend Stone beyond the strict

8

confines of the Fourth Amendment and with good reason,

9

because Stone is bound up in the unique status of the

10

Stone itself makes this

Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.
With respect to Miranda, the contention that

11
12

Miranda v. Arizona announced nothing more than

13

nonconstitutional rules is wrong, and it critically

14

obscures the issue in this case.

15

one thing that Miranda v. Arizona did was to announce

16

rules that are not required by the Constitution.

warnings themselves, for example, are not constitutionally

18

required.

Similarly, the mere occurrence of unwarned

21

custodial interrogation absent a use of the statements as

22

evidenced at chief -- at trial, while decried by Miranda,

23

does not amount to a constitutional violation because the

24

statements haven't been used against the defendant as

What is at issue here is something fundamentally

different, because in addition to these nonconstitutional

prophylactic rules, Miranda v. Arizona announced both a

fundamental constitutional principle under the self-

Court said was necessary to protect that right, and if I

could just go through both of those briefly, I think it

would at least point up my understanding of what's at

issue in this case when you are asked to apply Stone v.

they didn't need to, because to protect that

the compulsion that's inherent in custodial interrogation,

unlike Eagan and Tucker and Elstad, is the violation of a

2

constitutional right, or at the very least, a rule that

3

this Court has repeatedly emphasized is required by the

4

Constitution, and the question is, can this rule be

5

analogized to Stone?

6

We submit that not a single one of the factors

7

that motivated this Court's decision in Stone to restrict

8

the scope of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule,

9

counsels that result in this kind of a Miranda violation.

10

First of all, the foundation for Stone was the

11

recognition by this Court in many, many cases following

12

Mapp, that the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule was not

3

a personal, constitutional right or a personal right of

4

the defendant because it can neither prevent the Fourth

5

Amendment violation from occurring, nor can it redress the

6

Fourth Amendment injury that the defendant has suffered.

7

Rather, as Justice O'Connor explained in her

8

concurring opinion in Duckworth v. Eagan, the Fourth

9

Amendment exclusionary rule is a structural device

20

designed to promote sensitivity to constitutional values

21

through its deterrent effect.

22

but it's constitutionally required where and only to the

23

extent empirically it serves the function of general

24

deterrence.

25

It's a constitutional rule,

for the rule,

for example, where the police are acting in

good faith, as this Court held in Illinois v. Krull and
United States v. Leon and Janis,
exist.

the rule simply does not

It doesn't extend that far.
And that's what this Court decided in Stone.

In

Stone, this Court concluded that since the deterrent
effect, quote,

if any, of applying that deterrent rule in

collateral proceedings is negligible at best and the
societal costs of enforcing it on Federal collateral
proceedings substantial, therefore this Court held that
this judicially created deterrent remedy simply doesn't
include resort to Federal habeas courts.
Now, Miranda is totally different from that on
every score.

In the first place, unlike the Fourth

Amendment, which has nothing whatsoever to do with trials,
the Fifth Amendment self -incrimination clause is first and
foremost a trial right.

The very purpose of the clause is

to protect against the introduction at trial of compelled
statements of the defendant.
Indeed, unlike the Fourth Amendment, which is
violated by an unreasonable search regardless of whether a
trial ever occurs, no violation of the Fifth Amendment
self-incrimination clause is ever completed.

The first one, and the less substantive one, is

10

I don't believe it is in this Court's power to decide

11

which constitutional claims are better to reach and which

12

aren't.

13

there simply is no Fourth Amendment claim that a

1

Arizona stands for is the proposition that the self-

2

incrimination clause imposes a standard different than and

3

in addition to the voluntariness standard.

4

Under the self-incrimination clause, it is not

5

simply enough to show that a defendant's statement was

6

voluntary.

7

no point in ever applying the self - incrimination clause to

8

the States in the first place, because the voluntariness

9

test has always adhered in the Fourteenth Amendment and in

10
11

If that were the case, there would have been

the Fifth Amendment itself.
Instead, the self -- what Miranda holds is that

12

the self-incrimination clause, a) applies in the station

13

house and b) require -- allows a suspect in custody the

14

privilege not to make any statements that can be used

15

against him as evidence of guilt at trial unless he

16

knowingly and voluntarily waives that right, and I submit

17

that this Court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona is

18

replete with references to the fact that of course these

19

cases would not have been otherwise decided if the only

20

issue was voluntariness, and --

MR. WAXMAN:

examines Justice Harlan's dissent in Miranda, one can see

1

very clearly that certainly he understood that the Court

2

was announcing a constitutional principle.

3

If I could just quote the beginning of Justice

4

Harlan's dissent, having decided that the Fifth Amendment

5

privilege does apply in the police station, the Court

6

reveals that the privilege imposes more exacting

7

restrictions than does the Fourth Amendment's

8

voluntariness test.

9

It then emerges that the Fifth Amendment

10

requires for an admissible confession that it be given by

11

one distinctly aware of his right not to speak, and

12

shielded from the compelling atmosphere of interrogation.

13

From these key premises, the Court develops the safeguards

14

of warnings counsel and so forth.

15

Similarly, this Court in Michigan v. Tucker

16

stated, before Miranda, the principal issue in these cases

17

was not whether a defendant had waived his privilege

18

against self -incrimination, but simply whether his

19

statement was voluntary, so - -

QUESTION:

And how can you square that with your

2

earlier assertion that we have no power or no right to

3

make a distinction between various constitutional rules?

4

Now, what you say is well, we did it in Stone on

5

the basis of the purpose of the constitutional rule, and

6

we can't do it here on the basis of the purpose.

7

that's so, but that does not establish that we can't do it

8

here on some other basis.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Perhaps

Well, yeah, Justice Scalia, the --

10

when I agree with your statement that the exclusionary

11

rule is a constitutional rule, let me make sure that you

12

and I both agree on all -- what I understand to be the

13

premises of that statement.

14

The Fifth Amendment self - incrimination clause

15

itself is an exclusionary rule.

In addition to that, it's

16

quite clear, it seems to me, under the core Fifth

17

Amendment right, that if Mr. Williams came to this Court

18

and said, look, those statements were taken from me, I

19

had - - with no knowledge whatsoever that I had a right to

20

remain silent or they could be used against me, and the

21

State agreed with that.

22

The Fifth Amendment itself, without reference to

23

any prophylactic rule, would require, by its own operation

24

of law, that those statements be excluded.

25

Now, Miranda also applies an exclusionary rule

which does sweep somewhat more broadly, because in some
indeterminate number of cases there are people whose

3

statements -- unwarned statements are introduced, and in

4

fact it was a law professor who teaches constitutional law

5

and was not at all coerced and made a deliberate decision

6

to waive his rights and try and talk his way out of it,

7

but constitutional law is filled with prophylactic rules

8

like that.

9

to give meaning to the core principles of the Constitution

10

Indeed, it would be impossible for the courts

without access to prophylactic rules like this.

11

Now, the reason that I'm saying in this

12

particular case -- let me not take on the burden yet of

13

all prophylactic rules in the Constitution -- with respect

14

to this case, the fundamental reason why what this Court

15

did in Stone should not and cannot be done here is that in

Stone this Court was not dealing with an exclusionary rule

that represented the personal right of the defendant in

QUESTION:

Well, this one could be enforced --

for example, if you go beyond voluntariness to waiver of

of the -- every issue on admissibility of a confession to

try to determine whether he was aware of his Fifth

as waiving it.

We can do -- that may be a very awkward inquiry,
but we can do it without having a Miranda ruling.
MR. WAXMAN:

It's so awkward that this Court

MR. CAMINSKY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I have

just a few brief points in rebuttal.

13

Counsel for respondent has questioned whether

14

this Court really can or should limit Miranda claims on

15

habeas review.

16

U.S.C. 2243, which authorizes the habeas court to dispose

17

of the matter as law and justice require.

18

I would simply cite this Court to 28

It seems to me that if this court concludes that

19

it is a better use of the Federal judiciary's time not to

20

delve into the technical aspects of the Miranda claim on

21

habeas but simply to delve into the very heart of the

22

Fifth Amendment to try to prevent any sort of fundamental

23

injustice involving involuntariness, that is certainly

24

within this Court's power.

25

I think brother counsel and I may disagree about

1

whether that would be a wise thing to do, but I think this

2

Court certainly has the authority to do that.

3

Counsel also mentioned the four Federal judges

4

who've considered this, and their conclusion on the merits

5

of this case.

6

overlook the 20 judges on direct appellate review, the 20

7

judicial officers who passed on the Miranda claim and

8

found that it -- found it to be meritless.

9

I would not want this Court to look -- to

I think that essentially goes to the heart of

10

why Miranda claims do not belong on Federal habeas review.

11

A habeas petitioner, if he has had a full and fair

12

hearing, or if the opportunity for a full and fair hearing

13

in the State court, and has lost --

14

QUESTION:

Did all the State judges agree with

15

the same result on direct review?

16

MR. CAMINSKY:

17

QUESTION:

18
19
20

I beg your pardon?

Weren't the State courts divided on

the issue?
MR. CAMINSKY:

No, not on this issue.

The issue

that they were divided on - -

21

QUESTION:

Not this -- oh, I'm sorry.

22

MR. CAMINSKY:

Was the question of effective

23

assistance of counsel.

24

whether a plea offer had been conveyed to the defendant,

25

and that's the issue that caused the dissent.

There was some question about

QUESTION:

And did the Michigan Supreme Court

unanimously deny review?
MR. CAMINSKY:

Yes, it did, and this Court

denied cert without -- without a dissenting justice as
well.
Lastly, brother counsel has made the point, or
has made the assertion that the Fourth Amendment does not
exist on Federal habeas review.

That is simply incorrect.

What is true is that on habeas review this Court's inquiry
into Fourth Amendment concerns is limited to whether there
was a full and fair hearing of the matter in the State
courts.
If the Court finds that there was ample
opportunity to fully litigate the matter and that the
petitioner's other due process rights were not violated,
that is the end of the matter, but if it finds that for
one reason or another the petitioner was precluded from
raising the Fourth Amendment claim in the State court,
then it simply goes on and uses the mechanism Congress has
established resolving the claim on the merits.
Lastly, I would simply remind the Court there
doesn't really seem to be any disagreement between brother
counsel and myself that Miranda does sweep more broadly
than the Constitution.
It seems to me that Justice O'Connor's point was

absolutely correct, once the matter passes through the
State appellate system and we get to the Federal habeas
court, this Court should be concerned not with the
technical rules, not with the rules at the periphery of
all these amendments, but rather with the core
constitutional right that is involved here, and in the
Fifth Amendment context, that right would be the question
of involuntariness.
Are there any other questions?
QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Caminsky --

MR. CAMINSKY:

Thank you.
