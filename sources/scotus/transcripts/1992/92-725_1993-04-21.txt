ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. SARNOWSKI

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SARNOWSKI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Thousands of cases are processed in our criminal

12

justice system in both the state and Federal courts

13

throughout this land each day.

14

the issue of whether or not a defendant is competent to

15

proceed to trial.

16

Appeals in Federal habeas corpus review of a state court

17

conviction and the imposition of three death sentences

18

concluded that there is a heightened standard for the

19

determination of whether a defendant may proceed to either

20

waive counsel or to enter a plea of guilty, which occurred

21

in this case.

22

is the issue that brings us here today.

23

The lesser number involve

In this case the Ninth Circuit Court of

We take exception to that ruling, and that

However, there are some underlying findings by

24

the state trial court that I would like to direct the

25

Court's attention to, specifically they appear at page 21

of the Joint Appendix.

At that point the trial judge,

2

Judge Leavitt, determined that this petitioner, Richard

3

Moran, was in fact competent.

4

tracked a Nevada statute on point, Nevada revised statute

5

178.400, which in turn is a formulation of this Court's

6

pronouncement in Dusky.

7

that Mr. Moran knew the consequences of his plea of guilty

8

and that he can intelligently and knowingly waive his

9

constitutional right to the assistance of counsel.

He utilized language which

He also made an express finding

10

In 1988 the judge made additional findings which

11

also appear in the trial record and are before this Court,

12

particularly at the pages D-7 and D-8 of the petition.

13

QUESTION:

Do you say that the finding of

14

knowing and intelligent waiver is a higher standard or a

15

lower standard or indistinguishable from what the Ninth

16

Circuit found was the standard, which was I believe a

17

reasoned choice?

18

MR. SARNOWSKI:

Our position in this case, Your

19

Honor, is that once a defendant meets a standard of

20

competence established by this Court in Dusky, then a

21

defendant is competent to proceed either to waive counsel,

22

to plead guilty, or to proceed to trial.

What do you think that encompasses?

MR. SARNOWSKI:

Are there

To answer your second question

6

first, yes, there are reasoned choices that have to be

7

made - -

8

QUESTION:

Such as whether to testify?

9

MR. SARNOWSKI:

Yes, Your Honor, that is a

10

critical choice that each defendant if they choose to

11

proceed to trial must make.

12

trial they must decide whether or not they are going to

13

have a jury trial or have a bench trial in those states

14

which allow a defendant to waive a jury trial.

15

critical determinations that the defendant has to make.

16

They are, in our estimation, equally important as to a

17

defendant's cause as is the decision by a defendant to

waive counsel or to plead.

opinion?

9

MR. SARNOWSKI:

We believe that the trial judge,

10

Judge Leavitt, both asked the correct question and

11

received the answer which was in context and directly

12

addressed to the judge's question both --

13

QUESTION:

It's not altogether precise, it seems

14

to me, when we're concerned with the competency to waive

15

that you asked about competency to stand trial.

16

a little bit different question.

17

that competency to stand trial may indicate a level of

18

mental stability that's sufficient.

19

MR. SARNOWSKI:

It's just

I understand the point,

It is our position that if a

20

defendant is assessed and it is determined by the trial

21

court that he has a factual and rational understanding of

22

the proceedings, that he has the ability to assist, not

23

necessarily that counsel actually is assisting, because as

24

was the case here the defendant ultimately chose not to

25

have counsel, but if he does have that ability to assist

1

he has, he meets the baseline standard which also includes

2

the ability to make a reasoned choice.

3

He must make a reasoned choice at all stages of

4

the proceedings, and if he at some point in time does not

5

meet a competency standard, then as an officer of the

6

court it's up to his counsel or the prosecutor or up to

7

the court sua sponte to ascertain whether the proceeding

8

should be suspended or not.
In this case - -

QUESTION:

10

Is competency comprehended within

11

knowing and intelligent voluntary waiver?

satisfactory for a judge to say before I allow you to

plead I'm going to insure that your plea and the waiver of

rights is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary?

suffice in a case where we have some question about

16

competency?

Would it be

Would that

I believe that the judge has to

18

independently ascertain that the defendant is competent

QUESTION:

So that's different than knowing and

intelligent?
MR. SARNOWSKI:

Yes.

But in the sequence of

23

events that may well happen a judge may proceed on a

24

Boykin canvas or a Faretta canvas in terms of a defendant

waiving counsel and ascertain that a further inquiry into

The competence evaluation does

2

not necessarily occur first in every instance.

3

Here the totality of the circumstances that

4

faced the trial judge understandably did not peak any

judge made his finding that Mr. Moran was competent.

And

10

in fact at the conclusion of the competence determination

11

before the judge allowed them to be discharged the record

12

clearly reflects that he asked them if they had anything

13

to say to the court or to address the court and they chose

14

not to and indicated that the judge had covered what was

15

necessary.

16

the requisite requirements under Dusky.

17

At that point in time the judge had fulfilled

However, the question before us is did the Ninth

22

such standard is required by the pronouncements of this

problems that ensue because of it, the first and not the

QUESTION:

weren't bound by the results of a state court hearing

because they applied the wrong standard?

11

MR. SARNOWSKI:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And they said that their standard of

reasoned choice is a higher standard?

12

MR. SARNOWSKI:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, that's what they said.

So they must have thought it was.

you think it's -- if the court hadn't said so would you

present a question that this Court should consider.

2

However, it is very clear --

3

QUESTION:

Well, it set aside a state court --

4

it refused to follow a state court finding that otherwise

5

it should have.

6

MR. SARNOWSKI:

Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit

7

relied on a premise that merely because the state courts

8

applied an incorrect standard as far as the law is

9

concerned that its factual findings were not due any

10

deference, and we would certainly take issue with that.

11

The facts are what they are, regardless of the applicable

12

legal standard.

13

pronouncements in Maggio v. Fulford and Miller v. Fenton

14

require deference by the Federal courts to findings of

15

historical fact for state criminal defendants.

16

It is clear that this Court's

That did not occur in this case, and in fact we

17

would go so far as to say that the circuit court panel

18

considering the case substituted its own facts for those

19

not found to be weighty in the state court system.

20

instance, they relied on certain extracts from a

medications that the defendant was using at the time of

his plea had certain properties.

MR. SARNOWSKI:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Which you say was wrong.

If it's

3

supposed to be a higher standard you say they had no

4

business applying a higher standard.

5

MR. SARNOWSKI:

Regardless of the standard to be

6

applied they should not have substituted its judgment and

7

allocated different weights than the state courts.

8

this particular instance the state trial judge when he

9

conducted the post conviction review hearing in 1988

In

10

expressly declined to find that the mere fact that the

11

defendant was under the influence of some prescription

12

medications had any significant weight, and as a matter of

13

fact he found that the defendant had failed under state

14

law to bear his burden of proof to show that that had any

15

medical significance in that --

16

QUESTION:

Do you think this argument you're

17

making now is within your question presented, the single

18

question presented?

19
20
21

MR. SARNOWSKI:

We believe -- yes, Your Honor,

in this sense.
QUESTION:

I thought the only question you

22

presented was whether the Constitution requires a trial

23

court to apply a heightened reasoned choice standard to

24

determine competency of a defendant to enter a plea of

25

guilty or waive counsel.

1

MR. SARNOWSKI:

That is the question presented.

2

However, the circuit court's conclusion in this case was

3

inextricably bound to its own substituted facts.

4

is our position that had it not substituted the facts,

5

even under the heightened standard, the defendant in this

6

case could not prevail, and clearly he could not prevail

7

under the standard that we espouse before the Court.

8
9

And it

In this instance the trial judge looked at the
totality of circumstances to assess the defendant's

10

competence, and only when he concluded that he was

11

competent did he proceed to a very thorough Faretta canvas

12

which appears in this record.

13

he allow waiver of counsel, and then he proceeded into a

14

very thorough plea canvas which comports fully with this

15

Court's holdings in Boykin and the subsequent cases that

16

ensued as a result of Boykin.

17

And then and only then did

Although the defendant contested the knowing and

18

intelligent quality of the pleas that he entered, those

19

legal determinations were made in the state courts.

20

truly the Federal courts never got to the issue because

21

the Ninth Circuit's holding was grounded in its ruling

that as a matter of law that the higher standard applied

1

Kennedy's initial inquiry, once competence is ascertained

2

it is our belief that there are protections built into the

3

system, the requirements that those canvases in both

4

Faretta instances and Boykin instances must be knowing and

5

intelligent, and that together the Dusky standard, the

6

Faretta standard, and the Boykin standard provide the

7

minimal due process that each defendant should have in our

8

system before they are held to account for their actions

in a criminal court, be it state or Federal.

UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONER

16
17

MS. WAX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

18

The position of the United States in this case

19

is that a valid finding of competency to stand trial

20

suffices to establish competency to plead guilty or waive

21

counsel.

22

30 years ago in Dusky v. United States, and we believe

23

that it is still a workable standard for determining

24

competency to perform all of the functions that a

25

defendant may be called upon to perform in the course of

standing trial.
Now there are a number of reasons why this Court

2
3

should reject the idea that a person can go to trial and

4

yet be unable to waive constitutional rights.

5

view seriously distorts the meaning of Dusky and the

6

standard of competence to stand trial in this Court's

cases.

cases of this Court such as Jones v. Barnes that

That standard must be understood in light of other

Therefore in order to be competent to stand

capacity for basic decision making in response to well

14

explained alternatives.

defendants routinely at trial and the decisions at issue

in this case.

have frequently articulated with respect to pleas of

So you think in testing out the

here - QUESTION:

3

In your submission what is the

4

standard that a trial court should use in determining

5

competency to plead guilty and to waive the assistance of

6

counsel?

7

MR. POTTER:

It's a decisional competency that's

8

entwined with Johnson v. Zerbst as to voluntariness.

And

9

whether it's a broader inquiry, a focused inquiry, is not

10

the real issue.

It's not whether this is a reasoned

11

choice, although reasoned choices are involved.

think this Court has to reach that issue as to a bright

line test.
QUESTION:

14

Maybe we do, maybe we don't.

I'm defending the Ninth Circuit judgment.
MR. POTTER:

Well, there is, that can be

20

that their inquiry also deals with, although it says

reasoned choice and a heightened standard, it's also a

22

broader standard from the due process standpoint that

there has to be a searching inquiry made.

that you're really not necessarily -- number one, you're

We also cited the Nevada courts to

the application of a Pate type hearing, that when a

competent to stand trial, but he certainly may not be
competent if he's waiving counsel to make those same types

you misunderstood the consequence, or so forth and so on,
right?

It's not even entirely the same issue, is it?

Is

it entirely an issue of competence?
MR. POTTER:

There is a difference between the

actual competence and the specific inquiry as to whether
in fact an individual can make decisional matters such as
the waiver of counsel and the right to give up his
assistance.

In this instance I think --

inquiry as to competency at this hearing, do you not?
MR. POTTER:

Yes.

And the general questions as

to competency dealt only with his ability to assist
counsel and to stand trial.

They did not deal with the

specific aspect of him waiving counsel, of him deciding
that he was entering, going to enter a guilty plea.

actual competency and not with this due process aspect.

competency, his competency at that time to waive counsel

and enter a plea.
QUESTION:

4

Mr. Potter, a minute ago if I

5

understood you I thought you answered a question of mine

6

in this way, that what was defective in this case was the

7

failure of the court to make the kind of knowingness and

8

voluntariness inquiry upon the waiver or attempted waiver

9

of counsel that would have been required if the defendant

10

had pleaded guilty.
Now I understand you to be saying something

11
12

different.

13

failure here was in fact a failure under existing law, the

14

existing law being that there is a continuing duty on the

15

part of the court to make an inquiry into competence

16

whenever facts come to the court's attention that might

17

put that competence in question, and that the facts in

18

this case were facts brought to the court's knowledge

19

about the drug use, the medication that the defendant was

20

on.

21

court did not fulfill its affirmative duty under existing

22

case law to make a thorough inquiry to find out whether

23

the medication had in fact rendered the individual

incompetent.

I understand you now to be saying that the

that in fact in terms of the medication that he was
incompetent as to actual competency.

We also made an

examination.

So they did a preliminary psychiatric

But in addition to that when they were made

aware of the medication we were also entitled to an
additional competency hearing.
What really occurred here was no competency
hearing at the time that these pleas were entered and the
waiver of counsel was made.
QUESTION:

Whether or not that's so, it sounds

to me as though what you're arguing now is basically that
there was an error under existing law.

The Ninth Circuit

may have gone off on a tangent which you do not defend,
but your position is simply that there was an error under
existing law.
MR. POTTER:

That's correct.

And the existing

law, Sieling v. Eyman, that case encompasses the same
thing that Melacor v. the Nevada Supreme Court, which
incorporates the Pate type hearing, is the same analysis.
And that was the argument that we made.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. SARNOWSKI

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SARNOWSKI:

18

The Ninth Circuit clearly

19

disposed of this case below by applying the heightened

20

standard.

21

decision is set forth in which it says that certain

22

observations made by the trial court were inadequate to

23

show that Mr. Moran was competent according to the higher

24

standard of reasoned choice that the law requires.

that in order to reverse the state court's determination,

You think that's why the Ninth

Circuit felt constrained to find a higher standard?
MR. SARNOWSKI:

9

That's our position, Justice

I suppose it would border

somewhat on speculation on my part, but it would seem

10

that's one reading of their decision.

11

higher standard does not apply, deference must be

12

afforded.

13

In this case if the

Mr. Potter's argument was that no hearing was

14

held, and that's what they really proffered to the Ninth

15

Circuit as a basis for relief, fails to recognize that a

16

hearing was held.

17

it is not the preferred method of assessing competence to

18

have a hearing after the fact, the fact of the matter is

19

that the same trial judge conducted a hearing and applied

20

the burden of proof to the same party who had the burden

21

under Nevada state law, Doggett v. State, a 1977 case, to

22

show that he was incompetent.

23

And although this Court has said that

Of course this Court just said last term that it

is not impermissible to require a defendant to bear that

burden of proof, in Medina.

He didn't bear that burden of

his proffer of evidence and his failure to show how the
medication impacted the defendant at the time of the entry
of plea and waiver of counsel situation.
Supreme Court affirmed that.

The Nevada

He had his hearing.

And this Court's recent pronouncement in Keeney
v. Thomiel Reyes would seem to say the fact that he didn't
present the evidence then requires him to make a showing
of cause and prejudice, and he hasn't even argued that,
much less shown it.

He should not be given the second

opportunity in the Federal courts to do what he had the
opportunity to do, but did not, in the state courts.
If the Court has no further questions, I have no
further argument.
