ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. JOHNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question before the Court in this case is

12

whether United States courts have jurisdiction to review

13

respondent's allegations that while working for a

14

government-owned hospital in Saudi Arabia, he was

15

wrongfully arrested, imprisoned and tortured by agents of

16

the Government of Saudi Arabia.

17

question must be no.

18

The answer to this

Nevertheless, the United States Court of Appeals

19

for the Eleventh Circuit in this case held that clause 1

20

in the commercial activity exception in the Foreign

21

Sovereign Immunities Act conferred jurisdiction over

22

respondent's claims.

23

made two distinct findings:

24

cause of action in the complaint was based upon commercial

25

activity; and second, that that commercial activity had

substantial contact with the United States.
We submit that the court of appeals should be

2
3

reversed on both grounds.

Nevertheless, reversal of the

4

court of appeals on either ground requires dismissal of

5

the complaint in this case.

6

The court of appeals held that a cause of action

7

is based upon commercial activity when the acts complained

8

of bear a jurisdictional nexus to that activity.

MR. JOHNSON:

5

No, I think it's not that, Justice

White.

There is a question, which the Court would need to

7

reach if it were to find that, in the abstract, the

8

activity in the United States could reach the legal

9

standard of substantial contact, whether or not the acts

10

of HCA, which was the Cayman corporation which actually

11

did the recruiting in the United States, could be

We think the Eleventh Circuit's construction is wrong for

You're saying it would be based upon action, but

MR. JOHNSON:

Yes.

Not so much impact, because

everyone concedes in this case it's a clause 1 case, which

19

refers to substantial contact with the United States.

Do you think commercial activity -- a

commercial activity, such as a contract, the signing and

performance of a contract, is divisible so that the

10

signing of the contract is one commercial activity, the

performance of the contract in Saudi Arabia is a separate

12

commercial activity so that if you don't pay for the

13

service in Saudi Arabia, that is, indeed, a commercial

activity, but it's not a commercial activity in the United

MR. JOHNSON:

Well, I -- and I think these

questions come together somewhat in this inquiry because
the question is what is the cause of action based upon,
and to be sure, the cause of action does not refer back to
the recruitment activity.

It refers about -- to alleged

injuries -- pardon me - - occurring entirely in Saudi
Arabia.

So, I think the recruitment activity in the

United States is insufficient.
QUESTION:

Even with respect to recruitment, why

isn't the -- why isn't -- at least as to the negligence
cause of action here, why isn't that gravamen based upon
the activity in the United States?

The claim made is that

your client failed to warn -- failed to warn -- that there
was a danger in working in Saudi Arabia.
MR. JOHNSON:

That's correct.

course, has the same two components.

The question, of

moment out of the question whether or not that cause of
action is based upon commercial activity, obviously, we
contend that it is not.
QUESTION:

Wait.

MR. JOHNSON:

Why isn't it?

Well, because, Justice Scalia,

it's just a different theory of recovery for the same
conduct, and the statute is explicit in at least this one
thing.

the conduct in question.

2

action, to be sure, adds another legal element and spins

3

the theory of recovery somewhat differently.

that he complains about is, nevertheless, exactly the

same, and that's his allegations regarding the arrest and

imprisonment in Saudi Arabia.

The conduct

And we think the dispositive question for the

based upon inquiry is not what is the plaintiff's theory

of recovery or how clever has the drafter of the complaint

been, but rather, what is the core conduct in question, in

11

this case it being inherently sovereign conduct, arrest,

12

and imprisonment, and allegations regarding torture.

underlying conduct about which they complain, albeit

couched as a negligence cause of action -- every injury

We think, therefore, the Court ought to look to the

underlying core conduct, in your hypothetical injury in

10

QUESTION:

It's not different than the injury in Saudi Arabia

But the duty to warn arises out of

11

different circumstances, doesn't it?

12

more logical to say that there's a duty to warn at the

13

time of recruitment activity, which is in Florida, and tie

14

that to the commercial activity of recruiting.

15

to me that comes over more plausibly than to say the

White's earlier question, I don't concede that that

conduct is attributable to Saudi Arabia for purposes of

itself in the United States is most likely commercial

activity.

22

QUESTION:

Going back to Justice Scalia's

question, why don't you draw a distinction between a duty

hand, and a duty to warn about what the person giving the

I thought you were basing your argument in this

2

3

case on the fact that we simply do not -- tort law

4

generally does not recognize a duty to warn of one's own

5

malevolence, but tort law does recognize a duty to warn of

risks that are beyond the control of the person giving the

warning.

distinction.

And yet, you don't seem to accept that

Well, I think it's unnecessary for

10

the Court to go that far in this case, Your Honor.

11

say and as the United States aptly pointed out in this

12

brief, the allegation of respondent here is nothing more

than the allegation that an assailant has a duty to warn

That's right.

Perhaps as illuminating as the plain language of

21

the statute with respect to the Eleventh Circuit's

22

construction is the restrictive theory of foreign

23

sovereign immunity, which the statute was intended to

24

codify, as this Court held most recently in its decision

25

in Weltover last year.

The restrictive -- the primary characteristic,
indeed, the only distinguishing characteristic, of the
restrictive theory of foreign sovereign immunity is that
it purports to distinguish between the kind of conduct
which U.S. courts may adjudicate, commercial conduct or
the public -- or private or commercial acts of a foreign
sovereign, and that conduct which U.S. courts can never
review, the inherently sovereign or public acts of a
foreign sovereign.
And the trouble we have with the Eleventh
Circuit's jurisdictional nexus test in this case is that
it not only steps over that line, it erases that line
because under the Eleventh Circuit's construction, there
is no activity of any type which a U.S. court could not
adjudicate so long as the plaintiff were willing to allege
a sufficient connection with commercial activity.

It is,

therefore, a completely limitless construction of the
based upon language which erases Congress' primary purpose
in codifying the restrictive theory of foreign sovereign
immunity, to distinguish between the types of conduct
which can be adjudicated and the types of conduct which
cannot.
I've struggled to find a hypothetical that was
more indicative of the danger of that construction than
the facts of this case.

Candidly, there's hard to find

-- it's hard to find one.

In this case, the allegations

2

go to the very core, the very quintessential activity of a

3

government, the right to exercise its police power, the

4

right to arrest and to imprison, to decide when and under

5

what circumstances a defendant shall be informed of the

6

charges against him, to decide when and under what

7

circumstances he shall be provided with a translator, to

8

conduct the trial, and to generally govern the police

power within its own territory.

10

Nevertheless, if the Eleventh Circuit --

11

QUESTION:

12

May I ask on that point?

Would the

case be different if instead of the allegation being that

3

law enforcement authorities had been used, they had

alleged that the hospital had its own private police force

5

in effect that could discipline people for whistle

MR. MINEAR:

Well, as we explain in our brief,

the negligence claims may stand on a somewhat different

Government, when recruiting in the United States, violated

some recognized duty that is generally applicable to all

9

if Saudi Arabia conducts recruitment activities in the

MR. MINEAR:

1

Well, ultimately our position here

2

is based not on the merits of this individual claim, but

3

rather, we're concerned with the broader principle, and

4

that is the question of what we mean by based upon a

5

commercial activity in the United States.

6

The difficulty here is the result might seem

7

harsh in this individual case, but it accords with the

8

reasonable and reciprocal expectations of sovereign

9

nations with respect to the exercise of their police

10

powers within their own borders.

11

States would vigorously object to being sued in a Saudi

court by a Saudi citizen seeking damages based on his

13

arrest in this country regardless of the reason for his

arrest or his treatment while in jail.

Our view is, in this case, that even if you

could characterize the arresting and jailing of Mr. Nelson

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. STEVENS:

7

please the Court:
This is a case about jurisdiction over a

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

hospital, not a police department.

The question presented

10

is this.

May a hospital owned by a foreign government

11

come to the United States for its work force, recruit and

12

hire a United States citizen to perform a specific job

3

overseas, beat and torture him for the proper performance

4

of his responsibilities, and then claim immunity for its

5

actions in the U.S. courts?

6

We say it cannot.

Our argument deals with the

7

hospital.

It consists of two main points.

First, there

8

are, as the Court knows, three separate defendants in this

9

case, and there are, in effect, three separate complaints.

20

Where this hospital is concerned, petitioner's motion to

21

dismiss the facial challenge that they have mounted to

22

subject matter jurisdiction requires that a court focus on

23

the factual allegations in the complaint concerning the

24

conduct of the hospital.

Mr. Stevens, you say there are three

In its capacity as the owner and

Suppose the recruiter for Saudi

Would you say that Saudi Arabia would

MR. STEVENS:

First, Your Honor, we do believe

it's unquestionable that the principal will be answerable

20

for the acts of its agent and that there will be

21

jurisdiction extended for those acts even if they're not

22

performed directly in the United States.

23

the hospital and Saudi Arabia as its owner are answerable

24

for jurisdictional purposes at least for the actions of

On this basis,

something beyond the scope of its authority as an agent

that was wrongful, you would apply simple agency analysis

3

for purposes of liability, but the jurisdictional question

would remain to be applied and addressed under the

statute.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Stevens, suppose the hospital

7

supervisors had someone that they had hired beat up

8

because he was dating the hospital president's daughter.

9

Would that be a commercial activity?
MR. STEVENS:

10

Justice Scalia, our view is that

11

there is a very short menu that the Foreign Sovereign

12

Immunities Act provides.

Things are either commercial or

3

they are sovereign.

There is not a third, private type of

4

action which falls somewhere between the two.

5

Insofar as the hospital is concerned, the

6

activity that you described would be commercial for

7

jurisdictional purposes under the statute.

4

commercial capacity.

And you say so long as you're doing something

That's your position.

5

MR. STEVENS:

That is our position.

6

The statute in our view subjects the hospital to

7

the jurisdiction of the United States based upon its

8

conduct, commercial conduct, whether performed here or

9

abroad so long as that conduct has substantial contact

10
11

with the United States.
QUESTION:

What is that substantial conduct that

12

you rely on here?

the signing of the contract?

The advertisement in the newspaper and

MR. STEVENS:

The complaint alleges, in a

15

portion titled, Factual Allegations Against King Faisal

16

Specialist Hospital, a course of dealing in the United

17

States that goes well beyond the specific advertisement

18

that was issued in the U.S. media or the specific

19

recruitment of Scott Nelson.

20

But the most fundamental conduct here, Justice

21

O'Connor, is that the petitioners came to the United

22

States to ask Mr. Nelson to do a specific job for them,

23

induced him through a rather extensive course of dealing

24

to come to Saudi Arabia to do that job, and once he was

25

there, beat and tortured him precisely for doing that job

1

that they had recruited and hired him to do.

2

Now, when Mr. Nelson and the hospital entered

3

into an agreement here in the United States, there were

4

some specific aspects of that agreement that bear upon the

5

substantial contact requirement.

6

agreement identified Mr. Nelson as an expatriate employee

7

of the hospital.

8

as his U.S. point of origin and the point to which he

9

would be returned.

First of all, the

It identified Fort Lauderdale, Florida

It required him to surrender his

10

United States passport to the hospital, but it also

11

obligated the hospital to return him to the United States

12

following the termination of his services.

In other

3

words, this hospital said, Mr. Nelson, if you quit, if you

4

perform poorly, or if you break the rules of the hospital,

5

we will send you home.

6

Now, our view is that when the hospital entered

7

into that agreement and mutual understanding with Mr.

8

Nelson, it assumed an obligation to exercise care and

9

diligence as an employer for Mr. Nelson's safe passage

during his -QUESTION:

You wouldn't be making any different

argument, would you, if Mr. Nelson didn't perform his job

over there?

he didn't perform well, but -- and rather than just send

25

him home, they put him in the jug and beat him.

And let's assume -- let's just concede that

Precisely, we would.

Yes.

So, it's just sort of beside

first employed Mr. Nelson here in the United States,

2

through his tour of duty there, until he was returned to

3

this country, and that this, as an obligation reflected

4

directly in their employment contract, gives the Court a

5

sense of the substantial contacts that the duty and the

6

activities of the hospital vis-a-vis Mr. Nelson had with

7

this country.

8

QUESTION:

Well, I don't --

9

QUESTION:

But you seem to be making up for what

10

may be a shortcoming in the jurisdictional aspects by

11

spinning a very elaborate tort theory that kind of

12

subsumes everything.

I mean, that would be an easy way to

3

get around the limitations contained in the Foreign

4

Sovereign Immunities Act, to develop a very elaborate tort

5

theory that perhaps would turn out to be not supported by

6

the cases at all.

7

You say the Government of Saudi Arabia assumed a

8

duty to kind of look after him from the time he left this

9

country until the time he was returned.

Well, I really

20

think you have to stretch quite a bit to get that out of

2

these facts.

22

MR. STEVENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, this was Mr.

23

Nelson's employer.

It is commonplace in our law that an

24

employer assumes a duty to prevent injury to his employee,

25

a duty of diligence and care, ordinary care at least, for

Now, if there is such a

But not to prevent injury at the

4

hands of the employer.

5

MR. STEVENS:

I would say, Mr. Chief Justice, to

6

prevent foreseeable injury at the hands of anyone, to the

7

extent that the employer can exercise ordinary care for

8

that purpose.

9

QUESTION:

Well, you mean, when I leave the

10

premises of, say, the store that I work at and walk home

11

at night, my employer has a duty to see that nobody mugs

12

me on the way home?

3

MR. STEVENS:

Well, if your employer knows that

4

there is a dangerous criminal lurking outside the

5

entranceway, it may issue some kind of warning that you

6

should take care.

7

But more fundamentally, we're not talking about

8

the negligence question, because if there is such a duty,

9

however it may be defined, then certainly there's an

20

obligation on an employer not to cause injury.

allegations of the complaint say that's precisely what

this hospital did.

grievous injury, false imprisonment, and battery.

2

But that took place in Saudi Arabia.

3

It doesn't depend on any rather elaborate duty.

MR. STEVENS:

You're correct that it does not

4

depend, in the way that we think about these things, on

5

the articulation of a duty, but in our view, both in terms

6

of the nature of the commercial activity and its

7

substantial contact with the United States, you cannot

8

look at these torts, these intentional torts, in isolation

9

and rip them out of this commercial context.

These were,

10

after all, actions taken by the hospital as alleged in the

11

complaint, the truth of the allegations which petitioners

12

admit, by the hospital as an employer against its employee

precisely for the performance of his job responsibilities.

QUESTION:

In other words, you want us to look

at the purpose of the act.
MR. STEVENS:

Justice Souter, I think that the

7

purpose of the act here, why it may be that this employer

8

beat Mr. Nelson, that purpose is reflected in the

9

complaint, but that an employer intentionally injures an

20

employee in whatever association it may be, on the work

MR. STEVENS:

Our theory is that the action is

MR. STEVENS:

It was not, Mr. Chief Justice.

It

was handed down shortly before the act went into law and

I suppose it's doubtless true that

when you have a Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act case in

that the act was not a commercial act, then for purposes

of that statute, the act must be treated as an act of

MR. STEVENS:

QUESTION:

Precisely.

But in making the inquiry of whether

it's a commercial act or not, I don't think you approach

it with the mental attitude that everything in the world

has to be either a commercial act or a governmental act.

MR. STEVENS:

7

That seems to me not a

Well, we approach it in much the

8

same way, and it is a conundrum that this dichotomy places

9

one in, a dilemma, so to speak, and I would acknowledge

10

that.

QUESTION:

11

12

But our consideration is very straightforward.
I suppose perhaps the question is

whether piracy is commerce.
MR. STEVENS:

3

Well, the law has resolved that

4

question, Justice Stevens.

It could be a form of commerce

5

by those people who are engaging in it, I suppose.
The point is that this was an action taken by a

6
7

hospital, an employer, in the context of an employment

8

relationship, and it really doesn't matter why the act was

9

taken.

20

If you look to the experience of the U.S.

21

marketplace, you certainly can see all sorts of cases that

22

go off on the issue of the wrongful discharge of an

23

employee, retaliatory actions taken against an employee by

24

an employer, whistle blower statutes that are now the

25

modern craze, I suppose, to address these kinds of wrongs.

1

Nowhere is it suggested to me in our jurisprudence that

2

just because these acts were terrible, wrongful,

3

injurious, tortious, that they are less commercial for

4

that reason.
And consider the signal that such a conclusion

5
6

would send.

If a foreign sovereign running a commercial

7

enterprise wishes to breach a contract, well, it shouldn't

8

fire the employee and stand ready to answer in damages.

9

It should have the employee done away with, because then

10

it has removed any possibility that it will have to answer

11

for its actions in the U.S. courts since doing away with

12

an employee can't be a commercial act.

It's not clear to me the extent to

which you base your complaint on a breach of the contract

itself.

QUESTION:

3

Do you at least use the contract or

4

may you use the contract as setting forth the duties of

5

the employer, which then gives rise to a tort cause of

6

action?

7

Is that your theory?
MR. STEVENS:

Well, our theory with respect to

8

the contract is that it is impossible to understand either

9

the commercial nature of the activity or the

10

substantiality of the contact with the United States

11

without looking to the agreement.

6

You could, I suppose, make a quasi-contractual

7

argument that an employer is obligated by a contract not

8

to torture its employee, but you can also, under our

9

jurisprudence, make an independent and perhaps more

20

compelling tort claim, and that's what we have done.

21

QUESTION:

So, your theory is that by setting

22

forth terms of discipline in the contract, that at least

23

establishes that discipline was within the realm of

commercial activity and that the employer exceeded

permissible discipline and committed a tort in this
