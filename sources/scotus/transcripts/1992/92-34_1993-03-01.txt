, ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. BIRD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. BIRD:

9
10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case concerns the implication of a cause of

12

action for contribution in a Federal statute.

13

in question is section 10(b) of the 1934 Securities

14

Exchange Act.

15

previously implied a cause of action for people who suffer

16

losses as a result of purchases or sales of securities

17

where the - - as a result of damage -- or, pardon me, as a

18

result of violations of section 10(b).

19

The statute

It is a statute in which courts have

My theme today is simple.

The Court should

20

apply its intent-based jurisprudence of implied rights, a

21

standard which respondents concede they cannot meet when

22

asked to apply a cause of action for a contribution in a

23

statute in which a victim's civil claim has previously

24

been implied.

25

Respondents and their amici assert that the

1

Court should apply a different line of cases.

That is, a

2

line of cases involving fleshing out the victim's remedy

3

itself.

4

claim is a separate claim, and it should be treated as any

5

other potential implied right of action in this Court's

6

jurisprudence.

My burden today is to show that a contribution

7

Implied contribution is to be treated like any

8

other request for an implied action, first, because this

9

Court has said so.

In the Northwest Airlines and Texas

10

Industries cases, the unsuccessful petitioners made

11

arguments which are indistinguishable from the arguments

12

made by the respondents in this case.

13

contribution there as an implied claim over those

14

arguments.

15

The Court treated

In Texas Industries, the petitioner asserted

16

that contribution was not at all a new cause of action,

17

but only a supplement to the victim's express remedy in

18

that statute for damages under section 4 of the Clayton

19

Act.

20

argued that contribution was a necessary corollary to

21

judicial creation under the antitrust laws of joint and

22

several liability among violators of that law, and amici

23

in that case actually argued that contribution was somehow

24

within the penumbra of the statute itself.

25

The respondent -- petitioner in that case also

The court in that case said that in almost any

1

statutory scheme, courts may have to interpret ambiguous

2

or incomplete provisions, but the authority to construe a

3

statute differs fundamentally from the authority to

4

fashion new remedies.

5

The court also said that the judicial

6

determination that defendants shall be jointly and

7

severally liable does not suggest that courts have the

8

power to order contribution among the defendants, for

9

joint and several liability only assures that the victims

10

whom Congress intended to protect shall have full recovery

11

from some, if not all, of the perpetrators.

12

Were there any lingering doubt that somehow

13

Texas Industries and Northwest Airlines differed from this

14

Court's general jurisprudence of implied rights of action,

15

I would suggest that was put to rest last year in

16

footnote 6 of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools,

17

where the Court cited all of those cases as a single line

18

and said that it's intent-based jurisprudence shall apply

19

to all such cases.

20

Implied contribution is to be treated like any

21

other request for an implied claim, second, because

22

contribution is a distinct action and - -

I suppose that footnote sort of

implied contribution under section 10(b).

QUESTION:

No, not contribution, just cause of

MR. BIRD:

The implied cause of action under

action.

4
5

10(b) itself was grandfathered as far back as Bankers

6

Life.

7

courts have .adopted that implied cause of action for

8

victims and repeatedly in a number of cases the Court has

9

fleshed out that cause of remedy, but as -- the Court has

I think the Court has accepted the fact that lower

10

never addressed the issue whether there shall be implied

11

contribution.

12

Contribution is a separate action because it

13

always involves a different plaintiff, and that different

14

plaintiff is someone whose claim has not been recognized,

15

that different plaintiff is someone who is always a

16

perpetrator of a violation of the statute, always a member

17

of the class that Congress intended to regulate, never a

18

member of the class that Congress intended to protect.

19

Second, contribution very often involves a

20

different defendant.

Even if contribution is sought in

21

the same action where the victims seek their compensation,

22

third party practice permits other parties, other

23

defendants to be brought in by contribution actions, and

24

often, as is the case here, contribution brings to Federal

25

court a new suit.

Implying contribution truly extends Federal

jurisprudence to embrace a dispute which Congress has not

assigned the Federal courts to resolve, and that is a

dispute for adjustment of damages among defendants as

any express indication of congressional intent, why

shouldn't we continue to round out the scheme without any

indication of congressional intent?
MR. BIRD:

Contribution is not rounding out.

22

There is -- the rounding-out cases, of which Lampf is one,

24

must reach an answer.

There is absolutely no need, in rounding out the

QUESTION:

10

You think we're just -- we think we'd

11

just be off-base if we tried to devine what Congress'

12

intention might be if it thought about it.
MR. BIRD:

3

I do, Your Honor, very much so.

I

4

believe the kind of analysis which exists in the

5

respondent's brief in this case is a kind of analysis in

6

which this Court should never indulge in the process of

7

deciding whether to create a cause of action.
The question is an attempt - - Your Honor put it

MR. BIRD:

19

I would still argue that the Court

20

should not engage in that kind of reasoning by analogy

but you did not.

13

QUESTION:

Right.

14

MR. BIRD:

The Court did not do that, Your

15

Honor.
The analysis in Lampf commences with a phrase

16
17

which says,

"excepting that some limitation must apply,"

18

and by saying that this Court squarely placed the analysis

19

of Lampf within the same line of cases that says, we will

20

determine what is the standard of liability, that says, we

21

will determine whether purchasers or sellers or perhaps

22

someone else shall have a cause of action.
That was not the creation of the cause of

23

action.

It is not a form of reasoning which should be

25

applied in a case like this.

Well, why doesn't -- I'm sorry.

QUESTION:

Go ahead, please.

QUESTION:

Why doesn't this form of reasoning

No, go ahead.

apply?

One of our sort of rounding-out theories is that

5

if there is in fact a class of plaintiffs who are given an

6

implied cause of action, and there are other potential

7

plaintiffs who are in essentially the same equitable kind

8

of position that we ought to round out and extend to that

9

second group of plaintiffs, why don't we have sort of the

10

converse situation here -- that if in fact there is a

11

group of defendants who are in some comparable position

12

and have a right of contribution, then we ought to round

3

out our cause of action to do the same thing for

4

defendants under

0 (b)?

As Justice White referred a moment ago to the

section -- what is it, the section 9 and section

of action, there is contribution.

appropriate argument to make here as the equitable

Why isn't the same

argument in the case of plaintiffs that we recognized in

That is an extension of

Well, if -- may I just interrupt you

6

and ask this:

if we get over the question of whether to

7

call them plaintiffs or whether to call them defendants,

8

do they not have essentially the same equitable argument

9

to make:

10

We are in a worse position than those who have

11

been subjected to express causes of action where express

12

rights of contribution apply, and therefore we ought, as a

13

matter of equity, be accorded the same right, whether you

14

call us a plaintiff or whether you call us a defendant?

15

MR. BIRD:

Justice Souter, that is an issue of

16

pure policy.

17

fundamental question is whether the Federal courts should

18

entertain an argument of pure policy when what is before

19

them is the question whether Congress authorized a -- the

20

courts to create a cause of action.

21

They can make that argument.

QUESTION:

The

May I -- first of all, you don't

22

really draw a distinction between whether the contribution

claim is asserted after a judgment or after settlement or

24

before, do you?

I do not, Justice Stevens.

I just wanted to be sure, because

2

then it wouldn't matter whether you call them plaintiff or

defendant in that context.

4

But what about the reasoning in the Blue Chip

16

What the Court is being asked to do here

It's certainly more than an acorn,

17

and there are a lot of cases out there and there have been

18

for a good many years.

19

QUESTION:

20

(Laughter.)
MR. BIRD:

21

And it's a hard nut to crack, too.

Well, perhaps it's a little sapling,

22

but it certainly does not have the dignity that the 10b-5

23

cause of action had when it reached this Court in Bankers

24

Life, nor does it have even the theoretical underpinnings

25

of that.

1

When this Court first met the implied cause of

2

action under section 10(b), it had been recognized by far

3

more courts, including the courts of appeal, and it also

4

had an underpinning that that cause of action was implied,

5

under whatever theory of jurisdiction, for the very people

6

investors, who were the people to be protected when

7

Congress enacted section 10(b).

8

9

This is not a class of people who were to be
protected when Congress enacted section 10(b).

Congress

10

enacted section 10(b) as an extremely broad regulatory

11

statute, not simply the disclosure statute which the Court

12

sees most often.

13

There is no reason to suggest that in attempting

14

to regulate disclosures markets and anything else the

15

Securities and Exchange Commission thought was necessary

16

to protect the public and investors Congress intended to

17

do anything to adjust the rights and liabilities of

18

perpetrators of violations of the section.

19

Implied contribution also is to be treated like

20

any other implied action, because abandoning the intent-

21

based jurisprudence in this case is bad judicial policy.

22

The real -- if the real intent-based standard is

23

abandoned, Federal courts will face countless arguments

24

like the colloquy we have just had here suggesting that

1

equity, some party is entitled to assert a cause of action

2

because some other party is entitled to do so.

3

This reasoning by analogy is like looking at

4

legislative history through dark glasses.

5

true of it

Two things are

6

QUESTION:

Or at all.

7

MR-. BIRD:

Or at all, but in this case

8

certainly, first it's obscure, and second, what one sees

9

depends on the color of the glasses, because whenever the

10

Court begins trying to create causes of action by analogy,

11

the question is, what analogy is valid?
The validity of an analogy depends on adopting

12

13

the same premises that Congress adopted when it enacted

14

the statute, and the sort of reasoning which is being

15

urged on this Court today is a kind of reasoning which

16

attempts to create intent in congressional minds which was

17

not there.

Were there pendant State law claims

in this case?

all other claims were dismissed and there would remain an

A second critical issue of judicial policy in

11

Mr. Bird, what point in time do you

12

think Congress' intent is relevant when you're talking

13

about intent-based standards, back in '34, or more

14

recently?

15

rule was if they passed the statute, why, they expected

16

the judges to figure out the appropriate remedy, so I'm

17

wondering whether you're talking about intent in '34, or

18

intent since we changed the law a few years ago.

19

Because all the way back to '34, the general

MR. BIRD:

Well, the Court has uniformly applied

20

its intent-based jurisprudence looking at the intent when

the statute was created.

So we're looking at '34.

up once one starts to reason by analogy, and that is, what

1

Congress does one look at?
The secondary jurisprudence in this case already

2

3

includes what's the effect of partial settlement without

4

guidance of Congress, whether contribution, if allowed,

5

would be pro rata or by relative fault, some guidance by

6

Congress in section 11 of the 1933 act, none any place

7

else.

8

9

In this very case, if one were to look to
sections 9 and 18 and say well, Congress might have done

10

the same thing, in any case where there is both a section

11

contribution, should we look at section 20A and see if in

something about whether contribution was efficacious or

not, and explicitly declined to adopt it as part of the

The context is that for 22 years, and over the

continuous process of defining the configurations and

The Court looks to the 73rd Congress, the

decides what Congress would have intended had it

MR. OLSON:

Well, we have --

QUESTION:

Which might move it beyond Lampf.

3

MR. OLSON:

I've several responses to that.

4

That is the central and exclusive core to the petitioner's

5

argument in this case.
In the first place, the reference in those two

6

7

cases to the phrase, cause of action, was not necessary to

8

the decisions in either of those two cases.

9

Court was doing in those two cases, we respectfully

What the

10

submit, and the Court did unanimously, was look to the

11

intention of Congress.
In each of those cases, Congress had created an

12

13

explicit statutory remedy, and in each of those cases

14

Congress had not included a cause of action or a claim or

15

a remedy for contribution as a part of the explicit cause

16

of action.

17

created this cause of action explicitly, did not want

18

contribution as a part of it, and we will adhere to the

19

judgment of Congress.

20

As a result, the Court determined Congress

The phrase, cause of action, really had very

21

little to do with it.

What we submit is what is happening

22

in the Securities Act -- and by the way, in the Northwest

23

24

footnote, the Court specifically said, when Congress did

25

want to create a cause of action or a remedy or a right

1

for contribution, it did so, and the Court in that

2

footnote pointed explicitly to the securities laws, the

3

'33 and '34 acts.
Those -- the rule of contribution explicitly

4
5

provided in the Securities Acts is very unusual in Federal

6

law.

7

Thus, Congress knew what it was doing when it included a

8

rights -- rights to contribution in the Securities Acts.

There are very few explicit rights to contribution.

In fact, in section

9

and in section 9 and in

10

section

8, the reference to contribution is included in

11

the definition of the right or the remedy itself, thus

12

suggesting that Congress felt that contribution was a part

3

of the cause of action or a part of the remedy, and

4

suggesting that Congress felt that that contribution right

5

was an important essential feature of the remedy itself.

6

Thus, we don't believe that contribution is a

7

separate cause of action, but even if it were a separate

8

cause of action, the very same methodology would apply.

9

The Court would try to determine whether implying the

20

cause of action, if that's what's going to be done, would

21

be most consistent with the statutory framework.

22

We submit that, again, it would be most

23

consistent with the statutory framework, because every

This Court has determined over and over again

In 10(b) cases or in securities fraud cases, you'd have a

necessary -- as perceived by Congress, inclusion in the
Securities Act.
If you give plaintiffs an opportunity to repeal
contribution, and plaintiffs may well choose to decide not
to plead violations of the statute that do involve
contribution because they may decide that may give them
some leverage against some of the defendants, or they may
decide to dismiss some of the cases if they can make a
deal with some of the defendants because of joint and
several liability.
That would allow section 10(b), the noÂ­
contribution rule of section 10(b) to be used as a
judicial implied repeal of the contribution rights in the
other sections.
Furthermore, a decision against contribution
would, as Justice Stevens suggested in his questions a
moment ago, overturn 25 years of consistent lower court
case law.

Until a few months ago, when the Eighth Circuit

decided the Chutich case, there was 25 years of consistent

14
15

present in the original action or they could have been

16

present if the plaintiff had named them, and the liability

17

is the liability that's established in the original

18

action.

19

So we do not view this as a case in which it's

20

appropriate to apply the Texas Industries or Northwest

21

Airlines type of analysis.

22

where Congress has expressly created a cause of action but

23

has omitted a right of contribution.

That analysis is appropriate

lack the power to create a right of contribution that a
fortiori there wouldn't be such a right if it's only an

3

implied cause of action in the first place.
MR. LONG:

4

^

Well, again, the approach the Court

5

has followed is when it has implied the cause of action it

6

has undertaken the necessary process of defining the

7

contours of .that action of rounding it out, and where the

8

question is whether there should be a right of

9

contribution, we see no essential difference between

10

answering that question and answering the kinds of

11

questions that this Court has answered in many prior cases

12

under section 10(b), whether to recognize a defense, the

13

measure of damages -- this is really, we think, just

14

another question in that line.

15

QUESTION:

Well, to the extent that it is a new

16

cause of action, it seems to me it's a step beyond

17

questions about whether there should be a statute of

18

limitations or a defense.
MR. LONG:

19

I would agree with you that it's a

20

step beyond in that sense, but again, I would emphasize

21

this is quite different from implying a freestanding cause

22

of action.

23

And in the situation the Court is presented with

24

here, when section 10(b) really sits among some express

25

causes of action that Congress created, where Congress

D

expressly recognized rights of contribution and section
10(b) not only sits in the middle of those but in fact is

3

a kind of catch-all that overlaps to a great degree, for

4

the Court to not imply, or not recognize a right of

5

contribution we think would in fact be less respectful to

6

the intent of Congress than to apply the same policy

7

choice, the same weighing of policy considerations that

8

Congress made in 1934.

9

QUESTION:

I wonder what underlies that policy

10

choice in these other sections, or under 10b-5.

as a matter of evenhanded administration of the securities

laws that a contribution right ought to be recognized

under section 10(b).

QUESTION:

Why is

The Commission reached this

Well, how does that work out?

You

somebody gets stuck for the whole bill it's fairer to dig

say, for the entire liability.

QUESTION:

On Justice White's hypothesis.

2

MR. LONG:

Well, the plaintiff may be quite

confident, or reasonably confident on getting a full

recovery, because it is joint and several liability, and

if the plaintiff knows it's got a deep pocket --

that most plaintiffs would be in favor of the Commission's

suggested policy -- contribution?

want to have contribution.

QUESTION:

Because --

3

MR. LONG:

The absence of contribution I think

4

gives plaintiffs additional control over the lawsuit, I

5

think is the short answer to that.

6

Let me say, then, just a word about the second

7

point I have, why the Commission believes that the

8

comparable provisions in the securities laws evince a

9

congressional intent to allow contribution in private

20
21

actions for damages for securities fraud.
In Lampf, the Court identified the express

22

rights of action that are most analogous to the implied

23

right of action under section

elements of a complex web of regulations, as the Court

Consequently, Congress' express determination to
