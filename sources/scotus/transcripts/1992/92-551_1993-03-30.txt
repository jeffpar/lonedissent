ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DREEBEN:

12

13

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

14

This case involves a due process challenge to a

15

Federal statute, section 801 of the HUD Reform Act, which

16

revises the process for adjusting rents in the section 8

17

program.

18

for low-income tenants.

Section 8 provides federally subsidized housing

19

The Ninth Circuit held that the statute

20

abrogates contract rights between section 8 project owners

21

and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

22

Court of Appeals therefore concluded that the statute is

23

unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth

24

Amendment.

25

In our view, that holding is wrong for three

The

sa~

^

1

reasons:
First, the contract right on which the owners

2
3

base their challenge to section 801, the right to be free

4

of individual comparability studies when rents are

5

adjusted, is not guaranteed by the contracts in question.

6

As a result, the contract claim that forms the basis for

7

the Due Process attack does not exist.

8
9

Second, even if the owners had-the contract
right that they claim, section 801 does not constitute a

10

substantial impairment of that right within the meaning of

11

this Court's cases.

12

And finally, even assuming that the impairment

13

is substantial enough to warrant further inquiry, section

14

801 satisfies the Due Process Clause because Congress

15

acted rationally and permissibly in reforming the rent

16

adjustment process in the section 8 program both to

17

reinstate the program's market rent premise and to impose

18

uniform national standards.

19

Now, the starting point in this case is the

20

assistance contracts that the project owners enter into

21

with HUD or with the local intermediaries.

22

claim is that they have a contract right to automatic

23

annual rent adjustments each year based on a published HUD

24

formula.

1

a cap to that adjustment based on the results of what has

2

been called a comparability study, which is akin to an

3

appraisal or a survey of local comparable rents at

4

projects that do not receive Federal assistance.

5
6

In our view, the language of the contracts is
dispositive.

7

^

It appears on pages 4 and 5 of our brief.

Section 9 of the contract first provides for

8

adjustments based on a published factor determined by HUD,

9

but the contract goes on to provide what is called an

10

overall limitation, and that limitation states:

11

"Notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract,

12

adjustments as provided in this section shall not result

13

in material differences between the rents charged for

14

assisted and comparable, unassisted units as determined by

15

the Government."

16

Now, based on that provision, HUD conducted its

17

comparability studies -- surveys of market rents at

18

comparable properties.

19

adjustments that would be produced under the factor

20

technique would produce rents that materially differed

21

from those charged at the comparable units, it used the

22

comparability studies as a cap.

1

decision of the Ninth Circuit basically that that

2

provision should be read as requiring the Government to

3

factor in those differences in the published formula?

4

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.

5

The Ninth Circuit interpreted this overall limitation as a

6

subordinate guideline for HUD to use in composing the

7

factors, and in our view, that interpretation is wrong for

8

several reasons.

9

language of the contract.

First, it's not justified by the plain
The contract simply does not

10

say that HUD must use this overall limitation as a

11

methodology for composing the factors.

12

QUESTION:

Well, read in light of the statute,

13

could it be thought to be ambiguous to some extent as to

14

whether they're going to make these comparability studies

15

in the published formula or whether they're going to do it

16

separately in a case-by-case basis?

17

MR. DREEBEN:

The statute itself, in our view,

18

is not ambiguous on the question of whether comparability

19

studies are authorized.

20

QUESTION:

No, I said was the contract

21

ambiguous, read in light of the statute, which

22

contemplated, apparently, that the Government could agree

23

in these contracts to a formula approach to the

24

adjustments?

25

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I do not think that the

1

contract is at all ambiguous read in light of the statute.

2

The contract is, if anything, far clearer on this point

3

than the statute.

4

The contract explicitly uses the words,

5

"notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract,"

6

as a way of indicating that when there is a collision or a

7

conflict between the provision dealing with published

8

adjustment factors and the substantive standard that was

9

animating this program -- namely, that rents shall not

10

exceed market-level rents -- that the overall limitation

11

provision takes precedence, and the words that are used

12

there are crystal- clear on that point, I think.

13

If there is any doubt about what the statute

14

actually meant about it - - and I will concede that the

15

statute is not as precise as the contracts -- the statute

16

is entrusted to HUD to administer, and HUD, exercising the

17

authority that any administrative agency has in this

18

situation, has promulgated a regulation that is entitled,

19

"Overall Limitation," and that sets forth that the

20

comparability rule that is parallel to the statute and is

21

parallel to the contracts is an overall limitation, and

22

the agency has interpreted its authority under that rule

23

as authorizing comparability studies.

24
25

Now, the owners in this case have made much of
the fact that HUD did not in the very earliest years of

the program conduct comparability studies, but I think
that claim really pales against the historical background
here.
The program was enacted in 1974.

The first

published adjustment factor wasn't published until 1976,
and when that factor was published, HUD recognized that
there could be some problems with the factors, and those
problems arose because they cover extremely wide areas.
Exact, precise, reliable market data is not
available for every market locality in the country.

HUD

had to rely on information that they got from the Bureau
of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and it
used that information as a means of devising what it
believed would be generally accurate factors, but it
recognized that the factors might need to be improved.
Two years later, in 1978, an internal HUD task
force report noted that it is HUD's policy that field
offices may adjust rents up or down based on the results
of an individualized comparability study, and by 1981, HUD
had found out that there were sufficient problems in
certain areas that required the use of comparability
studies in order to ensure that what Congress intended
came to pass, namely, that the owners got annual rent
adjustments that enabled them to keep pace with the
movement of the market.

But in no situation were those adjustments
designed to produce rents that were materially in excess
of what comparable projects were experiencing in the area,
with the one proviso that to the extent that there was any
such initial difference when the contract rents were set,
it would be preserved.
QUESTION:

Well now, why did the Government

concede in the Ninth Circuit that section 801
substantially impaired the contract?
MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice O'Connor, I don't

believe that the Government did concede that in any
meaningful sense.

We did not specifically raise a

substantial impairment argument.

We argued that the

owners have no contract right to formula-based adjustments
without the use of a comparability cap.

We're arguing

that here today.
In the alternative, we argued in the Ninth
Circuit that even if there was an impairment of that
contract right -- in other words, if the Ninth Circuit had
been correct in its Rainier View decision -- that still
didn't constitute a due process violation, and we gave
many reasons for that.
We also, in the lower courts, addressed an
alternative takings analysis that had been proffered by
the respondents, and many of the elements involved in that

1

analysis run parallel to the claim we make today, which is

2

that even if the Court were to disagree with us on the

3

contract and find, contrary to our view, in the clear

4

language of the contract that there was a contract right,s;

5

as the Ninth Circuit saw it, even, still, the Federal

6

statute at issue here doesn't constitute a substantial

7

impairment of that contract right because the statute also

8

preserves the same financial standard that was always in

9

this program -- namely, comparable market rents.

i*».

It is respondents' burden, who are attacking the

10

■"

11

constitutionality of a Federal statute, to satisfy this

12

Court that they have met every element of the test that

13

the Due Process Clause requires, and in our view they have

14

not met the burden of showing substantial impairment.

15

Now, the Ninth Circuit gave one other reason on

16

the contract that I want to address.

17

concluded that if HUD's reading of the contract were

18

accepted, the election by HUD of the use of a formula

19

would be nullified.

21

statute.

That holding does not follow from

formula as the primary mechanism for adjusting rents.

projects, but what it did do was to apply the overall

It

limitation as written.
Namely,

2

if there was a conflict between the

3

comparability determinations and the formula, then the

4

comparability determination took precedence to the extent

5

of the conflict, and that is not a nullification of the

6

formula,

7

that's available to an owner.

8

QUESTION:

10

it simply is a qualification on any adjustment

It used the proviso only after it had

gone through the formulaic calculations.
MR. DREEBEN:

That's exactly right, Chief

11

Justice Rehnquist.

12

step of the process, and I think what makes it most clear

13

that this is an independent requirement of the contract is

14

that the contract itself provides two different mechanisms

15

for adjusting rents each year.

16
17
18

The comparability survey is the last

First, it provides the factor method which we've
been discussing.
Second, the contract provides for special

19

adjustments that any owner can seek when he can show that

20

operating costs at his project and similar projects, or at

21

his project alone, have increased more rapidly than is

22

taken into account by the general factor, and when that

23

happens, he can apply for a specialized increase based on

24

his project alone.

25

subject again to this cap.

If HUD agrees, he gets that increase,

The cap applies overall.

It comes at the end of

the section dealing with the rent adjustments, and it
governs both of the prior mechanisms for adjusting rent
that the contract and the statute set forth.
QUESTION:

Of course, if you

have your formulas

set unrealistically enough -- that is, high enough -- you
would always have this case-by-case adjustment applicable,
which would defeat the whole purpose of requiring the
formula.
MR. DREEBEN:

I think you're right, Justice

Scalia, that if HUD really manipulated the adjustment
factor in such a way so that it was never applicable, then
this would be a very different case.
QUESTION:

And Congress has required in the

statute that there be the adjustment formula, right?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, that's -- it required that

there be either the use of comparisons of fair market
rentals or a reasonable formula, and HUD elected the
reasonable formula approach, but the point here is that
the factors in general operation are not inaccurate.
The problem arises because the best information
that HUD could get during this period covered broad areas.
For example, there was one factor that governs the entire
Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area, which includes
Montgomery County, Fairfax County, it includes a variety
12

Ufa.

1

of areas in which economic conditions are quite different

2

from each other, and the factor may as an overall matter

3

be working just fine for most of the projects that are

4

located in that region.

5

But for particular projects, it might be quite

6

out of line, and it was to deal with that particularized

7

problem that HUD adopted the comparability survey

8

technique, it was not as a method of circumventing or

9

abandoning the factors as a whole.

10

*V

The Ninth Circuit seemed to read it that way,

11

but the record really doesn't support any such claim, and

12

there really has never been a claim in this case that HUD

13

on a wholesale basis disavowed factors.

14

publish them, and it's attempting to perfect them all the

15

time.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Do we have any idea what percentage

of the projects were reevaluated in this fashion?
MR. DREEBEN:

The record does not show that, and

19

I don't think that there have been reliable statistics

20

that would be publicly available that would show that kind

21

of information.

22

But again, I don't think that the respondents

23

have ever claimed that at any point HUD ceased to publish

24

the factors.

25

and they haven't attempted to claim that most or any

substantial component of the projects that are governed by
the factors didn't get the factor increase.
Now, in the alternative, and only if this Court
concludes,

contrary to the language of the contract, that

the Ninth Circuit is somehow correct and what HUD was
required to do was not apply the comparability survey
directly but to work it into the factors, or to revise the
factors in response to a comparability survey, then our
alternative submission is that section 801 of the HUD
Reform Act does not substantially impair the rights that
the respondents had under their contracts.
QUESTION:

May I just ask on 801, at the time

Congress passed 801, was the Ninth Circuit the only one to
have ruled on whether HUD could use comparability studies,
or had there been other courts, district courts in other
circuits,

that had ruled on the point?
MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Kennedy, to my knowledge

the Ninth Circuit was the only Federal court,

the only

court to rule on this issue.
There have since the passage of section 801 been
three other courts - - the Court of Federal Claims and two
district courts -- that have analyzed the
constitutionality of section 801, and all three of those
courts found that, as we submit, the owners never had a
contract-based right to adjustment - formula increases free

1

from comparability caps, and they therefore terminated the

2

constitutional analysis at that point.
When Congress confronted the situation, Rainier

3
4

View was the only Federal court to have ever held that

5

comparability caps could not be used.

6

in that very case had agreed with HUD that comparability

7

caps could be used, but had held that HUD hadn't

8

implemented them properly, there hadn't been national

9

standards -- all of those were administrative law claims

The district court

10

which the district court conceptualized under the guise of

11

the Due Process Clause, but the basic thrust was, HUD

12

hadn't done it right.

13

The Ninth Circuit, on the basis of its reading

14

of the contract language against the background of the

15

statute, announced for the first time that no, HUD, you

16

may not use comparability studies.

17

Where that left HUD was in an anomalous

18

position.

HUD had not, over the years, changed adjustment

19

factors to respond to imbalances that it discovered when

20

it did comparability studies, and under the Ninth

21

Circuit's ruling, the owners were in a position to claim

22

the full adjustment factor increase for each year, the

23

full measure of it, with no comparability constraint,

24

because HUD had misunderstood the way that comparability

25

had to be used, at least as the Ninth Circuit saw it.
15

So Congress confronted a situation in which a

1
2

program that had always been designed to keep rents in

3

line with the market, subject to these adjustment

4

procedures, now had projects in it that could claim the

5

benefit of adjustments that would put it far in excess of

6

the market, and these adjustments would amount to

7

windfalls in the truest sense, because they resulted only

8

because the agency had misunderstood what its financial

9

obligations were under the contracts when it readjusted

10
11

v

rents.
Faced with that situation, and faced with the

12

fact that the Rainier View decision was on the books, this

13

Court had denied certiorari, the program had to function

14

effectively as a Nationwide program, and it was now

15

subject to disparate standards, Congress enacted section

16

801 as a mechanism to restore the basis for adjusting

17

rents going forward and to try to rectify the problems it

18

had identified going backward.

19

Now, retroactively, what Congress did was to

20

raise the rents of the section 8 project owners who had

21

been limited by comparability studies or who had not

22

actually requested rental adjustments because they feared

23

that they would get negative adjustments through

24

comparability studies, and HUD said that as to -- Congress

25

said that as to those owners, the full factor shall be

1

applied to increase their rents, but only to the portion

2

of the rents not used for debt services.

3

So Congress determined to adjust their rents

4

upward to the extent that those rents were affected by

5

operating cost increases, but not to the extent that they

6

were used to cover debt service, which of course hadn't

7

gone up during that period.

8

since refinancing is an option.

9

They may well have gone down,

Congress also provided a floor of 30 percent of

10

the full factor adjustment to make sure that no project

11

owner was really left with just a nominal supplementary

12

payment, and again, Congress did that as a means of

13

rectifying what it perceived as well-founded criticisms of

14

the comparability process, yet at the same time, Congress

15

was unwilling to sanction a full windfall adjustment

16

factor as the owners saw it.

17

Simultaneously, Congress decided to reform the

18

program going forward on a prospective basis by requiring

19

HUD to do, in essence, as the first level response to rent

20

problems, rent adjustment problems, to do what the Ninth

21

Circuit said -- adjust the factors if you can, construct a

22

modified adjustment factor based on a smaller market area

23

than the large, original going-in adjustment factor, and

24

use comparability studies to achieve that result, and that

25

surely is not an impairment of the contract right even as
17

te.,

“s
-

1

respondents claim it, because that's what the Ninth

2

Circuit said HUD was supposed to do.

3

Only if that fails, and HUD determines that it

4

cannot construct a modified adjustment factor, or even if

5

it does so, the adjustment factor that it constructs fails

6

to achieve the goal of comparability, HUD is then

7

authorized to use another means of employing comparability

8

studies to get to its ultimate objective.

9

At most, in our view, that is a tinkering with

10

the process and procedure that does not constitute a

11

substantial impairment, because it leaves the owners'

12

financial rights intact and it changes only the way that a

13

comparability study can be used.

14

HUD always had the right to conduct a

15

comparability study.

both of which we would disagree with, the impairment is

2

sufficiently substantial to warrant its invalidation under

3

the Due Process Clause.

4

This Court has not, since the 1930's,

5

invalidated a Federal law on the ground that it had

6

impaired contract rights between the Government and a

7

private party under the Due Process Clause, and we submit

8

that this is not an occasion on which that very strong

9

medicine is warranted.
The section 8 program is, at its base, designed

10

11

to use public funds in order to provide low-income housing

12

through the mechanism of private owners providing the

13

housing and receiving subsidies from HUD.

14

Two features of this program are critical.

The

15

first is that owners are to get rent adjustments each year

16

in order to accommodate changes in the market, and the

17

second feature is that the system was never designed to

18

give the owners above-market rents that would reward them

19

for in effect not being as efficient as the private sector

20

in providing the housing, again subject to the condition

21

that initial differences in the setting of the rents would

22

not be abolished.

23

Now, the Ninth Circuit's ruling upset the

24

statutory scheme in two distinct ways, and we've discuss

25

them both.

The first is that it made it impossible to

2

Neither Congress nor HUD was willing to

3

acquiesce in what it believed was a wrong decision and bad

4

public policy, and therefore neither Congress nor HUD

wanted to extend the Rainier View approach to the entire

6

Nation, so you had a result of a Nationwide system that

7

was no longer functioning under uniform, sound criteria.

have a Nationwide, uniform system for adjusting rents.

And the second feature of the legal terrain that
Congress objected to was that, even where factor-based

10

increases could not achieve the goal that Congress had set

11

for them -- namely, providing fair, reasonable increases

12

each year that were not in excess of comparable rents - -

13

HUD would have been required to grant such increases, and

14

those results were simply unacceptable in the context of a

15

social welfare program that had the purpose of providing

16

subsidized housing for low-income tenants, not to give

17

windfalls to their landlords, and section 801 responded to

18

the situation to put the program back on track.

19

It restored uniformity to the program's

20

operation, and as we've discussed it did that in large

21

measure by accepting the owners' complaints about the way

22

in which comparability studies were conducted, and it

23

required HUD to put out regulations that would rectify

24

prior deficiencies, and it also reinstated and made

HUD's mistake -- HUD's failure to recalibrate the factors
to the local submarkets in light of comparability, a
mistake that would not have been appreciated before the
Ninth Circuit's ruling, and HUD did not appreciate.
In our view, those purposes are legitimate and
substantial and, in light of the relatively modest
impairments that could be said to occur in this case, the
rent adjustment mechanisms of section 801 do not infringe
the Due Process owners' rights and the constitutionality
of section 801 should be upheld.
QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, could I ask you a couple

of questions about your first point?

Do you acknowledge

that this contract should be interpreted, in the case of
ambiguity, against the Government?
MR. DREEBEN:

No, Justice Scalia, we don't, for

two reasons.
First, that the case -- the United States v.
Seckinger, from which that test is drawn, requires that
the alternative readings both be reasonable and
practicable as well as finding the existence of an
ambiguity in the contract, and in our view it would not be
a reasonable and practicable alternative to require HUD to
adjust the adjustment factors in light of comparability
studies if in fact adequate data does not exist to allow

MR. DAHEIM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
One might ask why a person would build a four-

9

unit apartment specially designed for the handicapped and

10

the elderly in the town of Froid, Montana, a town of less

11

than 400 people located in a remote corner of that State.

12

That's one of the projects in this lawsuit.

13

W

Very well.

And the answer is, they built that project

14

because HUD made certain promises, and HUD made those

15

promises in writing, a writing that was drawn by the

Government attorneys, a writing which specifically said it

17

was assignable for financing purposes, a writing that

18

specifically provide -- provided that the Government's

19

policies were backed by the full faith of the United

20

States Government.

21

One of those promises, and the reason why we are

here today, was a written promise of annual rent

23

adjustments based on factors published annually in the

QUESTION:

Webster's says that "notwithstanding"

has several meanings, and one of them is "despite," and
that is as a preposition rather than as an adverb like you
would use it.
MR. DAHEIM:

Well, it -- once again, back to the

Ninth Circuit's position on this.

HUD wants to treat this

language as saying these factors are coming out of -- off
the wall.

They seem to be -- they're totally unrelated to

their factors that they themselves select.
They select these factors -- it seems the most
logical meaning of that language is that when you are
selecting those factors, and clearly they can select the
factors and make those determinations, they can come up
with subareas, whatever subareas they think are
appropriate, but having made that decision, that's where
this thing is functional.
Now, actually, it's sort of strange, because the
Government - - another branch of the Government was here
last week arguing basically my position in another case,
saying that we have a framework.

My Lord, how can we go

to ad hoc, standardless determinations after the fact?
Now, that's exactly the position that they are
arguing for here, ad hoc positions without a standard
whatsoever, and that's what they did.

They didn't publish

MR. DAHEIM:

That's sort of a shorthand.

they specifically said is that you will get your factor,

but not on the full dollar amount of the rent.

get it on the full dollar amount less your mortgage

You will

So in other words, the only person who gets the

6
7

full factor amount is if you're mortgage-free, if you're

8

debt-free.

9

there, you get the factor only based on your 20 percent. I

mean, where they came up with that, it's -- that isn't, in

fact, irrational.

14

addressed these factors.

The response is irrational.

If they

I mean, even if you were talking about windfalls

16

in some kind of a way, you would do like they did in '76,

17

when the oil prices went up, and in some rational basis

18

try to determine who got windfalls and who didn't, but

19

this thing is completely irrational.

imposed upon them.

All it concentrates

Let me get back to Justice Scalia's comment once

That guy in Froid is a member of this class

4

He couldn't afford to challenge HUD, and they know it.

You can't get an appraiser, you can't get an attorney, you

can't go through that process, and that was supposed to be

the beauty of this thing.

Let's get the private sector to go on out and do
what we bungled.

We bungled it with public housing, we

10

bungled it under section 23 where we tried to manage these

11

projects, we bungled it under section 236 and wound up

12

having to take these things back.

13

It was a process where the owner was supposed to

14

make money or lose money.

15

out and get his own financing, so if the project goes into

16

default the Government doesn't wind up with it, and the

17

only way they could sell that was to tell these owners,

we're going to give you a rent adjustment process that

we're not going to have our finger in.

Chevron in their primary brief.

I respond to it obviously

as inapplicable, and then of course they come back in
their reply brief when I can't answer it and put in the
City of Fulton.
The City of Fulton, however, is not applicable
for two or three reasons.

Number 1, it seems, Your Honor,

that the contract did nothing more than mirror that
statute.

This contract does something more than mirror

the statute.

It has a choice in the contract.

Number 2, in Fulton, they said that there was no
other evidence of what the parties' intent was.
there is other evidence.

Finally, on purpose, we think that whatever the
