Mr. Ball, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. BALL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. BALL:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, may it please the

Court:
The important issue posed by this case is whether Jim

12

Zobrest, the petitioner, a profoundly deaf boy, would have to

13

have forsaken education in the State-qualified religious

14

school of his parents' conscientious choice if he were to

15

participate in a program designed by the Congress of the

16

United States to aid the education of all handicapped

17

children, including children in public and religious --

18

including public and private and religious schools.

19

Now, the courts below answered that question by saying

20

yes, and that is the respondent's position and that of the

21

respondent's amici.

22

Now, Jim, in order to be educated, had to have the

23

service of a certified sign language interpreter, a related

24

service under the Education of the Handicapped Act.

25

have it on the place where his education was going to happen,

He had to

4
1

and the place where his education was going to happen was

2

Salpointe Catholic High School, a high school which meets the

3

requirements of Arizona's compulsory attendance law and which

4

is accredited as a college preparatory school by the North

5

Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

6

But it's also a school which is pervasively religious,

7

and on the ground, the sole ground that to afford Jim a sign

8

language interpreter, on the premises of a pervasively

9

religious school, would violate the Establishment Clause, the

10

court - - the respondent school district denied him the

11

service.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Ball, before you get too far, just

13

clarify one point for me.

14

the statute only provide for in-kind furnishing of services?

15

Would the statute not permit the parents to hire their own

16

sign language interpreter and be reimbursed?

17

MR. BALL:

Under the statute, could -- does

Yes, Your Honor.

We don't find any authority

18

in the statute for the school district, for example, to have

19

paid the parents money so they could go and hire the

20

interpreter.

21

subsection I can't recall -- it seems -- would seem to

22

preclude that.

23

could not be disbursed to the parents for that purpose.

In fact, there is a - - under section 1415 -- the

All the funds therefore -- funds therefore

24

QUESTION:

1415 is what --

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a different question about

2

what may just positively be prohibited.

3

litigated the effect of the Arizona constitution or the effect

4

of the statute and the regulations on the ultimate question of

5

entitlement here?

6

MR. BALL:

At any point have you

We have never -- in this case because solely

7

the Federal' Establishment Clause was raised, we have not in

8

any way gone into the Arizona constitutional question.

9
10

QUESTION:

And you haven't litigated the legal as

distinct from the constitutional issue.

11

MR. BALL:

I'm sorry?

12

QUESTION:

You haven't litigated the question of legal

3

entitlement, entitlement under the law and the regulations, as

4

distinct from the constitutional issue.

5

MR. BALL:

Well, we have not litigated it because, in

6

fact, the process had already gone a great distance.

QUESTION:

The

No, I'm not necessarily faulting you for it.

I just want to make sure that I am right that the record
simply does not contain determinations on these two issues.
MR. BALL:

No, Justice Souter, but I think it's

22

important that I add there the fact that at the time the

23

parents applied for EHA help to the school district, the --

24

Jim was already enrolled at Salpointe Catholic High School,

25

and the issuance of the individualized education program to

him took place in the context of the fact that that's where he

2

was and that the sole problem -- the sole problem -- and this

3

appears in the individualized education report itself.

4

sole problem was the Establishment Clause.

5

Now, the key issue, as we see --

6

QUESTION:

The

Have you taken a look at the statutory

7

provision and the regulations here, and are you -- would you

8

conclude that they clearly require the provision of the

9

services in private schools?

10

MR. BALL:

Yes.

The -- to begin with, section

4 5(a)

QUESTION:

Or does it leave it open to the State to

-

11

3
4

decide?
MR. BALL:

Well, they don't leave the -- the statute

5

doesn't leave it open to the State to decide whether private

6

school children will be included, and the statute also

7

provides and the regulations provide that there will be

8

provision made for the education of children enrolled in all

9

private schools.

And the regulations, the -- under 30 of the

20

Code of Federal Regulations -- specify even parochial schools.

21

They use that term, and the only question then is where and

22

under what circumstances those services would be provided.

23

But there has to be afforded the child in the private

24

school, including a parochial school, a genuine opportunity.

25

He must be furnished or she must be furnished services of the

same scope and quality as those provided for public school

2

children.

3

5

QUESTION:

Did the school district ever raise any

objection based on the regulations or the statute?
MR. BALL:

None whatever.

Their sole -- Chief Justice,

6

their sole objection throughout was the Establishment Clause.

7

In fact, throughout the proceedings before the district court

8

and before the court of appeals, they insisted that Jim would

9

be provided - - would be required to be provided the services

10

by them on the premises of a public school or of any -- any -

11

- nonsectarian private school.

12

Now, the key issue, as we see it, is whether the --

13

furnishing of an interpreter to Jim would have had a primary

14

effect advancing religion.

15

problem raised as a lesser issue.

It would get nothing in

One is that it would

If he can't get the interpreter, he'd have to go to

MR. BALL:

No.

The tuition would not be paid for at all

by the school district.
QUESTION:

No, no, no, but his parents are paying the

tuition now.

9

MR. BALL:

They did, indeed.

10

QUESTION:

But they will not be paying that tuition to

11
12

13
14

the school if he goes to school someplace else.
MR. BALL:

The parents will pay the tuition to the

school where their child is enrolled.
QUESTION:

That's right, so that if he doesn't get the

15

interpreter, he won't attend the school, and they won't get

16

that particular tuition.

17

a small point.

18
19

That's all I'm saying.

It's perhaps

But is it not true that he needs an interpreter wherever
he goes to school?

20

MR. BALL:

Absolutely so.

21

QUESTION:

And if he can't get it here, he'll have to go

22

to school elsewhere.

23

MR. BALL:

24
25

Yes.

Then he'd have to give up the religious

education.
QUESTION:

And the school would lose that amount of

tuition.
MR. BALL:

The school would lose that amount of tuition

4

QUESTION:

Maybe that's not significant.

5

MR. BALL:

-- for one child.

QUESTION:

But they will lose at least that much.

MR. BALL:

It is more than the cost of the interpreter,

but here's a school with many children.

interpreter for one child.

This is one

We're speaking of one school, and

QUESTION:

And unless the school loses money on each

child, which a lot of schools do - -

17

MR. BALL:

Yes.

18

QUESTION:

-- and the deficit made up out of

19
20

contributions.
MR. BALL:

They had no program for the deaf.

There's no

21

real market to bring in deaf children.

22

interpreters who are certified are very, very scarce.

23

Sign language

The second reason which the respondent attempts to

24

advance is that a certified sign language interpreter will

25

inadvertently or intentionally inculcate religion in the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

children.

Here I think the respondents totally misconceives

2

what certification of a sign language interpreter amounts to.

Under -- in Arizona, an interpreter must be qualified

under the interpreter quality assurance system.

what the interpreter's function is.

9

American sign language into spoken English, spoken English

10

11

He is a

It's simply to translate

into American sign language, and that's it.
QUESTION:

Mr. Ball, isn't there a slightly different

12

argument which has greater strength here, and that is not that

13

the interpreter is going to inject a religious element that is

14

not there, but that the interpreter is, as I understand it, a

15

kind of necessary functionary for the religious message to get

16

through?

17

just as necessary as having the teacher or the priest or

18

whatnot there and, therefore, is just as much an integral part

19

of the conveyance of the religious message as some of the

20

equipment, for example, which was denied to schools under our

21

prior cases under Meek and Wolman on the theory that they

22

might be used for that purpose.

23

And, therefore, the interpreter is -- in effect, is

MR. BALL:

Well, in the first place, the interpreter is,

24

indeed, a -- the window of communication of religion in the

25

schools.

He will be conveying religion.

No doubt about it.

It's a given in the case.
The fact that he does that does not put him - - does not

create an image of authority to him in any sense that a

QUESTION:

Yes, but tape recorders, or whatever the

equipment - -

MR. BALL:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

-- was in those cases, I suppose didn't

5
16

acquire any such aura either, and yet their potential use for
the purpose of this kind of communication was forbidden.

7

why isn't this interpreter, even if we assume the kind of

8

neutrality of the role that you describe, in the same boat

9

with the equipment?

20

MR. BALL:

And

Well, you bring me back to Meek, Justice

21

Souter.

22

a hearing aid, for example, could not be loaned or provided to

23

a -- for the use of a child in a religious school.

24
25

In Meek, I find nothing by which the Court said that

Well, how about a hearing aid that is only

used during school hours when the school's purpose is

12
1

religious?

2

it?

3

That would have been a different case, wouldn't

MR. BALL:

Well, in our case it's used -- the

4

interpreter is used for the whole educational program, and

5

there we get to the question of whether the fact that he is

6

used for religious purposes, as well as secular purposes,

7

results in a primary effect advancing religion.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, only because the school has secular, as

well as religious, purposes.

10

MR. BALL:

Exactly.

11

QUESTION:

And what I was trying to suggest is that it

12

seems to me that the interpreter here is pretty much in the

13

category not of the hearing aid that's used during all waking

14

hours and outside the school, but in the position of the

15

equipment which is used only during the school, which was the

16

problem in Meek and - -

17

MR. BALL:

But it was a problem in Meek, if I may say

18

this, only because the -- of the massive size of the program.

19

I well realize what the Court said in Meek about the fact that

20

the inanimate object could be turned to religious uses.

21

But as I've reread Meek very, very carefully, it's quite

22

clear that in an effort to distinguish the Meek situation from

23

what the Court faced in Allen v. Board of Education, the Court

24

was saying, well, here you're into a massive program of

25

supplying materials and supplies and equipment to parochial

school systems.
I think the interpreter - - I think if the boy must be

2

3

denied this - - the service of an interpreter here because it

4

would be like the hearing aid and that the hearing aid was

5

forbidden in Meek, I don't think it becomes a realistic

6

application of Meek.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

10
11

Mr. Ball, you're not really going to try to

Are you going to tell us why a globe is okay,

The answer is that --

(Laughter.)

17

QUESTION:

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. BALL:

The answer is that I will not, Your Honor.

You couldn't.

The next reason given by the respondent --

20

and this was the reasoning - - one reason of the court of

21

appeals why the furnishing of the sign language interpreter to

22

Jim would have had a primary effect advancing religion -- is

23

that it would have created a symbolic union of church and

24

state.

25

under two headings.

And this can be -- and the respondent addresses this

14

1

One refers the -- the first heading refers to the

2

impressionable youngsters, Jim's peers, who would be -- who

3

would see that interpreter as symbolizing a union of church

4

and state, as an endorsement by the school district of a

5

Catholic school.

6

but it goes to the breaking point when I'm thinking of Jim's

7

peers, these impressionable youngsters, saying something like,

8

guys, you see that fellow who's making those signs.

9

it's like awesome.

10
11

I can only stretch my imagination so far,

Well,

Right here in chem lab we're seeing a

violation of the Establishment Clause -(Laughter.)

12

MR. BALL:

-- of the First Amendment.

3

QUESTION:

I thought the argument was for establishment

4

that here is the State furnishing directly financial support

5

for a sectarian purpose.

6

MR. BALL:

Yes, but --

7

QUESTION:

None of that symbolism business.

It's just

8

that they're -- you're not supposed to furnish money to a --

9

you think the State could -- under our cases could just pay

20

for the -- pay for -- contribute to the sectarian schools the

21

amount of that to the extent they are furnishing a secular

22

education?

23

MR. BALL:

I was dealing only with the question of a

24

symbol, an image of endorsement, in the eyes of impressionable

25

youngsters, and I simply don't think that it -- that that

particular impression of it.

4

think that would be a far more likely image that the kids

5

would have.

6

If they did, they might say the
Well, that's neat.

I would

Secondly, they say that furnishing the interpreter would

7

create the image of a joint enterprise of church and state.

8

This again -- here they rely on Ball v. Grand Rapids School

9

District, but there you had 40 sectarian schools.

You had a

10

massive infiltration of teachers, public teachers, into

11

religious schools.

12

like the image that one boy with one interpreter in one school

13

can conceivably provide to the public.

Would the case be different if we were

dealing with a tutor for a homebound student in a parochial

school, someone who had to convey their own views of the

MR. BALL:

Oh, very much so.

QUESTION:

-- instruct the child?

21

MR. BALL:

Very much so, yes.

Here the -- sign language

22

interpreters have been described to me as regarding themselves

23

as nonpersons, which gets us very close to the hearing aid

24

example that Justice Souter raised.

25

I think the primary effect that this furnishing of the

16

1

interpreter would have is simply to enable a youngster to get

2

an education in the general branches of learning.

3

respondent says that the - - that one reason why you can see a

4

primary effect advancing religion here is that the parents

5

chose a religious school, and their motivation was to get him

6

a religious education.

7

far more obvious reason, namely, to get this boy equipped for

8

the business of life by getting an education in the general

9

branches of learning, learning the same math that will be

The

Of course, it was, but was there not a

10

learned in a public school, the same modern foreign languages,

11

the same computer literacy, everything that he would get in a

12

public school in order to enable him to become independent, to

3

become self-sustaining, and to survive in a world not always

4

hospitable to deaf people?

5

There has been much talk in the media about whether we

6

are seeking an overruling in this case of Lemon v. Kurtzman.

7

Nothing in Lemon bars, as we see it, the providing of this

8

service to this boy.

9

and their supporting amici come perilously close themselves to

20

seeking an overruling of Lemon because they appear to ask this

21

Court to strike the primary effects test from the Lemon test,

22

and instead of saying primary effect, advancing religion, they

23

seem to be urging the Court to say any effect accommodating

24

religion.

25

I think, however, that the respondents

I'll reserve what time I have left for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

5

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. BRYSON:

6

7

Court:
We agree with Mr. Ball that the principal issue in this

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

case is whether the second test from Lemon is satisfied, and

10

we submit that the primary effect in this case of the benefit

11

that was conferred is not to advance religion and that the

12

second test in Lemon, therefore, would indicate that this is

3

not an establishment of religion.

4

I think it's useful to look at perhaps the most succinct

5

statement of the test under Lemon, the succinct -- most

6

succinct recent statement that this Court has made, and that

7

comes in a concurring opinion of Justice Powell -- excuse me -

8

- which was joined by two other members of the Court and was

9

endorsed by yet another two members of the Court.

So, in a

20

sense, it speaks for a majority of the Court in the Witters

2

case.

22

And he said, quote, State programs that are wholly

23

neutral in offering education assistance to a class, defined

24

without reference to religion, do not violate the second part

25

of the Lemon test because any aid to religion results from the

things that'they disagree with and will sign them nonetheless.

They are not expected to agree

10

expected to change, by virtue of their own predilections,

11

anything that they hear.

12

Now, the themes that I think that you can trace through

13

this Court's Establishment Clause cases, in the aid to schools

14

area at least, that we can tease out from Justice Powell's

15

statement are as follows.

16

First, where the service is made available directly to

17

the individual as opposed to the school, you will ordinarily

18

not find an Establishment Clause violation.

19

Similarly, where there's a broad class that is the

20

recipient of the service that is not based on religion -- in

21

this case, everyone who is the subject of a disability was a

22

student -- that also indicates no Establishment Clause

23

problem.

24
25

Third, where the school gets no financial benefit out of
the arrangement.

And here, I think in answer to Justice

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

Stevens' point that the school does, after all, get the
tuition, this Court has been very clear in cases going back to
Everson, which was the bus transportation case, and going
through the Allen case and the Mueller case, the tax deduction
case, and Witters, Witters in particular, that the fact that
the school gets another student and the associated tuition is
not enough to constitute a primary effect for Lemon, the
second part of the Lemon test, purposes.
So, there's no financial benefit here.

Salpointe is

essentially in a position of just being a stakeholder with
respect to the financial impact of this arrangement.
And finally, that -- you have to ask the question of
whether there is any expression of endorsement or support for
the religious view that is being put forward or for religion
at all.

And here again, we submit that there is neither any

implicit support on the part of the State for anything that's
being said here in the religious school merely by virtue of
the fact that the State is providing the child a means to hear
what's being said, nor is there any sense in which the State
is somehow endorsing the message of Salpointe High School in
general by providing an interpreter there.
The interpreter is serving as this child's ears.

This

interpreter is doing nothing more than performing at the
State's behest the service of enabling this child to hear
whatever it is that - -

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, may I ask whether it is clear

2

here that the statute and regulations require the State to

3

provide this service?

4

MR. BRYSON:

The statutes and regulations, Your Honor,

5

do not require it.

The statute operates essentially as this.

6

The statute gives local educational agencies a great deal of

7

freedom to design programs as they will.

8

some cases that the local educational agency will say we are

9

going to provide certain services, but only in the public

That may mean in

10

schools because it's just impractical to do it.

11

nothing that compels.

12

QUESTION:

13

There's

That would be consistent with the Federal

scheme.

14

MR. BRYSON:

15

QUESTION:

That's right.

That's right.

And if Arizona's constitution, for example,

16

prohibited the furnishing of a -- of services like this, that

17

wouldn't interfere with the Federal scheme at all.

18
19
20

MR. BRYSON:

Well, there's a provision -- the short

answer is no, it wouldn't.
The somewhat longer answer is there is a provision in

21

the statute that allows what's called bypass, which is to say,

22

if there's something about local law that generally precludes

23

a certain type of service, then you can go directly to the

24

Federal bypass provision and you can get aid directly from the

25

Federal Government.

So, there is a provision in the statute

22
1

2

that deals with that problem.
But the way this case comes to the Court is that it was

3

conceded all the way along that this service would be

4

available to this child except for the fact that he was in a

5

religious school and only then, not because of the choice of

6

the school district, but only because the school district felt

7

compelled by the Establishment Clause to say no.

8

has been purely an Establishment Clause defense to what

9

otherwise would be the school district's conceded

This case

10

acknowledgement that under their own policies they would

11

provide the service to the child in place.

12

Now, the school district --

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, may I just keep you interrupted

for a moment more and go back to your point on the primary

effects test?

do, that the interpreter is necessary in order to communicate

17

or to hear, however you want to put it, the message, and if

18

you also accept the premise, which is that, I understand it,

19

of the school, that the intertwining of the religious and the

20

secular messages are -- is inextricable --

If you accept the premise, which I think we all

21

MR. BRYSON:

22

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- that is, that is really the point of the

23

school as they run it -- does it make any sense to try to

24

apply a primary effects test here?

25

The fact is the entirety of the message is going to have

a religious content, a religious overlay, a religious
reference, and there's no way to communicate or to hear
anything without communicating or hearing the religion.

Under

those circumstances, does the primary effects test make any
sense?
MR. BRYSON:

I think it does, Your Honor, and that is

because what we're concerned with is asking -- is, does this
benefit itself actually have the primary effect of advancing
religion?
Here, the State has acknowledged that he can get an
education at this school that satisfies the State's
requirements.

So, they have defined this institution as a

valid secondary school for Arizona purposes.
QUESTION:

There's no question it has a secular function

too.
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

That's right.
Yes.
You would apply primary effect to this case

just as you would to the bus driver case or a case in which,
for example, the school district provided -- suppose we had a
severely paralyzed child who needed a nurse to wheel him in a
wheel chair from one class to another, including religion
classes.

We submit that that would not have the primary

effect of advancing religion because although the nurse's
availability would be necessary to his getting his education

MR. RICHARDSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

The constitutional question presented in this case is

10

whether Federal law can require a public school district to

actively participate in a student's religious education.

QUESTION:

MR. RICHARDSON:

We would not, Your Honor.

Why not?
Because this Court's decision in

employee, standing as a public employee in the classroom and

employee, not the school district.

So, a public -- suppose the interpreter, the

sign language interpreter, in a public school is paid on a

5

piecework basis and the -- and but that same public person is

6

paid by the parents on a piecework basis to go over to the

7

parochial school.

8

Would that bother you?

MR. RICHARDSON:

I'm not sure I understand the question,

9

but I think the critical distinction is, if I understand the

10

question, is -- to me is whether the person in the classroom

11

that's transmitting the religious information is or is not a

12

public employee functioning at public expense.

13

We think in Witters, this Court carved out an exception

14

that said when the State provides money to a student or his

15

family and then takes a hands-off approach -- and that's a

16

second condition that we think would be necessary that is not

QUESTION:

-- amicus brief makes very clear --

it, but I'm looking at the regulation, which is set out on

page 45a of the Government's brief, which I assume is

applicable here, that no State may use its grant -- and I'm

6

skipping inessential language -- to pay for religious

7

instruction'.

between church and nonchurch private schools?

9

Doesn't that have an effect in distinguishing

MR. RICHARDSON:

Absolutely, and let's use an example.

Many students under the IDEA have mental disabilities.

need the services of a one-on-one aid to assist them

12

academically in the classroom.

13

student attends a nonparochial school, a private nonparochial

14

school, we may choose to give that aid because all they're

15

going to do is assist the student in a secular education.

16

if you take that exact situation and put it in a parochial

school, you would have an employee whose job it would be to

QUESTION:

Why didn't you raise it?

MR. RICHARDSON:

Because the reality of dealing with the

to take a long, expensive trial because the answer isn't a

The United States has consistently

QUESTION:

they wouldn't be there if they thought that the Federal act

would have forbidden you to furnish these services.

MR. RICHARDSON:

Well, they don't because they think

Edgar is - - these regs are consistent with the First

19

Amendment, and they don't think the First Amendment is

violated.

if we accept their premise that the Edgar regulations merely

nothing to do with statewide practice, does it?

20

MR. RICHARDSON:

Yes.

We had already been informed,

however, that that just mirrors the First Amendment, and so

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM B. BALL
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BALL:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I was interested that Mr. Richardson referred to the
Arizona School Boards Association brief amicus curiae in
connection with his argument that the interpreter will fulfill
a teacher's function.

Exhibit -- or the first appendix to the

Arizona School Boards' brief amicus is the report of the
National Task Force on Educational Interpreting, and it says
that the interpreter's task in a school is interpreting.
That's his priority.

It goes on to say that the role of the

educational interpreter should not include classroom
management, that is to say, formal instruction and classroom
supervision.
The Court in Meek spoke of teachers and said the teacher
remains a teacher.

Well, the interpreter remains an

interpreter very, very clearly under the ethical code.
My second point is
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Ball.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 12:06 p.m., the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted.)
