CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

General Barnett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK BARNETT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9

MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

In 1944, Congress recognized that there was a

11

need to bring the massive Missouri River under control.

12

They passed the Flood Control Act at that time which was

13

to authorize the construction of reservoirs and dams and

14

to convert that river to public beneficial uses.

15

By 1954, that scheme had resulted in the entry

16

into an agreement between the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe

17

and the Government that for a sum certain, all lands,

18

interests, claims, demands, et cetera, in the affected

19

property would be conveyed in fee simple or in fee title

20

to the United States subject, however, to certain

21

conditions, quote, hereinafter set forth, end quote.

22

The treaty underlying this dispute is the Treaty

23

of 1868 which, for all intents and purposes, is

24

indistinguishable from the treaty that this Court

25

considered in Montana v. U.S. some 12 years ago.

1

The issue before the Court today is whether, in

2

light of that alienation of land under the act, whether or

3

not the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe somehow retained

4

regulatory authority over nonmembers on what was now and

5

is now public land.

6

To answer that question --

7

QUESTION:

8

9

But what used to - - did it used to be

part of the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation?
MR. BARNETT:

Yes, it did, Your Honor, and the

10

- - I should say the eastern boundary of the reservation

11

jutted out into the mid-channel, quote, unquote, of the

12

river, and that reservation boundary is still there at

13

this time out into the water somewhere.

14

is approximately 2 million --

15

QUESTION:

The reservation

Does that mean -- just so I - - does

16

that mean that the area in dispute is now within the

17

reservation?

18

MR. BARNETT:

There is - - the issue --we have

19

not brought the issue before the Court today of

20

diminishment, and --

21

22

QUESTION:

You haven't brought it here, but it

was decided below that there was no diminishment.

23

MR. BARNETT:

QUESTION:

25

That'S --

There's no appeal.

Ergo, we have to

accept the case as coming to us with this territory being

4

within the reservation.
MR. BARNETT:

I think that's a fair statement,

Your Honor.
I should state, as a way of factual background,

5

that there are some 2,800,000 acres in this reservation.

6

Approximately 1,400,000, or half of the reservation, has

7

been alienated out to non-Indian fee ownership.

8

particularly important in this analysis that the Court

9

keep in mind that the strip of take land that was along

And it's

10

that western side of the Missouri River and on the eastern

11

edge of the reservation included not only 100,000 --

12

104,000 acres of tribal land, but also 18,000 acres of

13

non-Indian fee land.

14

QUESTION:

Is that a checkerboard situation on

15

the reservation where the holdings of fee land and

16

reservation are kind of like a checkerboard?

17

MR. BARNETT:

It is interspersed.

I think it

18

would be accurate to say that the majority of the fee land

19

on the reservation is towards the northwest corner, or

20

away from the river.

21

other portion of fee land that had taken place in this

22

reservation prior to the taking was along that river, some

23

18,000 acres.

24

land had come into being, and then between those, slightly

25

removed from the river and in many places directly along

However, again, as I mentioned, the

And so, there's really two areas where fee

So, yes, there was

Since the gates of this dam have closed and the
water has arisen, the tribe has not sustained --

So, does this case involve the -- any

7

States?
MR. BARNETT:

originally.

It does not anymore.

It did

The courts below have found and the tribe has

10

basically conceded that as to the fee lands not in the

11

take area, that they were no longer claiming jurisdiction.

12

However, they had originally in the declaration in '88

13

that caused us to go to court.

14

The tribe has not sustained, quote, an

15

independent and vigorous scheme of wildlife management on

16

this reservation, and I quote from the Government's brief

at page 6.

The district court found -- and I quote -- the
End

20

The tribe admitted through its Game, Fish, and

21

Park Director at trial -- this is in your joint appendix

22

at 379 -- that the tribe does not do any management on the

23

Missouri River and does not even have a plan for fishery

24

management.

25

And that is at 381.

QUESTION:

How does that bear on the legal

1

issues involved in this case, General Barnett?
MR. BARNETT:

2

The tribe has -- for a period of

3

some 30 years, Your Honor, the State of South Dakota has

4

vigorously managed all of this public property and assumed

5

jurisdiction over all of this area, both the take land,

6

whether it was previously Indian land or whether it was

7

previously fee land by non-Indians, as well as all the

8

waters.

9

jurisdiction and management of that asset, and the tribe

10

We have asserted and maintained and exercised

has not.
QUESTION:

11

But does that bear because of some

12

statute or some case from this Court?

13

tie that fact into the established law regulating this

14

subj ect?

15

MR. BARNETT:

I mean, how do you

I think that it is the most

16

compelling evidence of how all of the parties to this

17

entire transaction have construed the '54 act.

18

act made it quite clear that all interests, all lands were

19

to be conveyed to the public, to the government, and that

20

is in section I, except for such conditions are set forth

21

in the act.

22

The '54

Section II again suggests all interests, not

23

just the land, but the interests, were being conveyed to

24

the public.

25

And last, but not least, section X, which was

form submitted by

the tribe, the tribe was -- treaty

3

rights were to be

limited in the future to access.

4

Whereas before, but for the navigational servitude, they

5

might have claimed that they had control under section X,

6

they were reduced to a position of access -- and I quote

7

-- subject, however, to regulations governing the use by

8

other citizens of the United States.

9

And so, our position is, Your Honor, that for 30

10

years, we have read that act

11

12

13

to say just what it -- to

says, that the tribe had lost the power

And I might point out in that contention that

14

the tribe lost the power to exclude that section 4 of the

15

'44 act, which authorized the entire process, specifically

16

said that no use of these areas shall be allowed which is

17

inconsistent with the game and fish laws of the State in

18

which the area is situated.

19

what it sounds like it says, that the State game laws will

20

be in control in these areas.

QUESTION:

We read that to mean just

General Barnett, am I correct that

22

you have taken or you have represented to us that the only

23

regulation to which the State has consented in the past,

basically by agreement I guess, has been regulation of

MR. BARNETT:

We have conceded and we do concede

I might add that - - and I would suggest that

10

it's in deference to the citizens who are tribal members

11

--we also are not contending today that -- or rather, we

12

are conceding that the tribe can regulate that activity of

13

its own members out on this public property.

even arguing that point, but only that we are regulating

15

the activity of nonmembers on this public property.

of the district court, a nationally recognized fishery

5

with regard to certain game fishes.

We have developed what is now, in the words

You might ask -- and I think it's a fair

6

7

question -- if the State has exercised jurisdiction for 30

8

years, and the tribe has not, which is clearly what the

9

district court found, then how did we get to this dispute?
In 1988, the State attempted to enter into an

10
11

agreement with the tribe with regard to the taking of

12

deer, not just on the public property and not just on the

13

reservation, but in effect, a joint opportunity for

14

hunters to buy one license, split the revenue between the

15

entities, and allow the hunter to go where the game is

16

without respect to jurisdictional boundaries.

17

those negotiations broke down when the tribe insisted that

18

before nonmembers could hunt on that public property, they

19

would have to have tribal permission.

20

to that demand, and so at that time, negotiations broke

21

off.

22

That --

We could not accede

And the tribe then publicly announced -- and

23

I'll quote the tribe's brief.

Quote, the tribe announced

24

its intentions to enforce tribal hunting and fishing

25

regulations on the taken area.

That's at page 14.

And

The State license will no longer be honored.

And yet, the tribe comes before you today and

suggests that they've had jurisdiction and exercised

And I would submit to

a public announcement suggesting that now you must have a

tribal license to hunt on these public lands?

I would submit to the Court as well - -

QUESTION:

General Barnett, they could have had

14

-- thought they had jurisdiction before, but simply

15

decided that, as a matter of comity, they would honor the

16

State hunting license.

17

MR. BARNETT:

I think that the best evidence of

18

what the tribe thought was the fact that for some 30 years

19

they had not made any actual -- they had had a regulation

20

in I believe the '30's under the Indian Reorganization Act

21

that suggested or that they claimed gave them jurisdiction

22

over these nonmember activities.

QUESTION:

3

And that's a reference to a

General Barnett, where does the State

4

acquire the authority to issue hunting licenses for this

5

land?
MR. BARNETT:

6

I would submit first under Rosebud

7

v. Kneip, the principle that this Court suggested, another

8

case coming out of South Dakota, that when the State has

9

exercised jurisdiction for so many years, without

10

objection through those years from the Government or the

11

tribe, that this can create jurisdictional expectations

12

and that it also is good evidence of how the parties

13

construe the law.

14

QUESTION:

Could the Corps of Engineer -- Corps

15

of Engineers say anybody can hunt and fish without a State

16

license or we'll issue a Corps of Engineers licence

17

instead?

18

MR. BARNETT:

I would submit that the -- there

19

isn't any question that the Federal Government has the

20

right to regulate this property, and probably the answer

21

to that question is yes.

22

also pertinent that the Corps has worked with us through

23

all these years.

Federal, State, and local laws and regulations remain in

2

full force and effect, where applicable, to these water

3

resource development projects.

4

MR. BARNETT:

I think that's an additional

5

source, and I think a source even earlier than that is

6

section 4 of the '44 act, which made it clear this was to

7

be opened up to the public for boating, recreation,

8

fishing, and so forth.

9

QUESTION:

Oh, I have no doubt about that, but I

10

just wonder whether -- you know, why it is that the State

gets the right to exclude anybody - -

12

MR. BARNETT:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BARNETT:

I think there's also --

-- Federal land.
--a principle that runs through

15

the cases of this Court that the powers not exercised by

16

the Federal Government, and particularly with regard to

17

navigable waterways, are reserved to the State.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you thought that the

analysis in Montana would -- in the Montana case would

control this case.

I would refer you to the district court comment in its

decision where it said this case is indistinguishable from

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, where did Montana say the State

got the authority to regulate on fee land?
MR. BARNETT:

6

I think it was a recognition of

7

the concept that jurisdiction over these waterways, to the

8

extent not used by the Federal Government, should remain

9

in the States.

And in fact, during the discussion of the

10

ownership of the bed, the Court noted the equal footing

11

doctrine, which made it very clear in that case that

12

Montana owned the bed and that there were certain inherent

13

sovereignty sorts of rights that reserved to the State for

14

the management of that water.

15

QUESTION:

Is it clear and conceded by everyone

16

that this property that the United States took is open to

17

the public?

MR. BARNETT:

I don't think there's any dispute

about that, Your Honor, although perhaps the other side

There was testimony by the tribal

nonmembers from this public property.

MR. BARNETT:

The regulatory authority of the

tribe stems from its treaty rights under the same

identical -- basically identical treaty of 1868.

And in

10

the discussion on those treaty rights, I would refer you

11

to the Congressional Record, 15609, where Representative

Case -- and this is in our briefs -- said -- and I quote

13

-- hunting and fishing rights were also a part of the

concurrent jurisdiction will work.

although it was not addressing exclusive jurisdiction by

about the issue of tribal jurisdiction over this land

Therefore,

If we are to read it, as this Court advised last

clause of the statute has meaning, then tribal council

11

must mean something more than the mere right to hunt and

12

fish because every member of the tribal council enjoyed

13

that already by virtue of the general reference to a

14

reservation of powers to hunt and fish.

15

In light of that, the one place in the

jurisdiction actually occurred in a colloquy between the

tribe's representative and Representative Berry, the

19

sponsor of the legislation, the day after the conversation

that General Barnett referred to.

the tribe has always asserted jurisdiction over this taken
area both before it was taken and since 1954.

It has

never acquiesced in State jurisdiction, and that the
jurisdictional matrix which has, in fact, ensued is that
the tribe enforces its tribal fishing and hunting
regulations against all, including nonmembers, on the
taken land; whereas the State of South Dakota has limited
its enforcement to nonmembers.

Those are the findings of

the district court and they are not disturbed.
In - - moreover, if I can get back to - - strictly
with respect to the grazing, it gave the grazing, which is
the most important aspect of this land.

Because it is

done pursuant to the tribal grazing code, the district
court found that it gives the tribal land a distinct
Indian flavor because it is criss-crossed by fences
setting up these areas.

That code is enforced by the

Bureau of Indian Affairs, and in fact, the entire area has
a pervasive Federal presence.

The tribal regulation is

subject to oversight by the Corps of Engineers, but not by

2

Federal Government not only does not see anything

inconsistent in permitting tribal regulation of hunting

5

checkerboard nature of the area being surrounded by lands

QUESTION:

And you say it is the interpretation

of the Corps of Engineers that local laws in section 327.0
of their rules and regulations governing public use of

10
11

water resource development includes tribal laws.
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

The intent of the Corps was

12

to have other laws that govern fish and game apply so that

13

the Corps doesn't have to adopt a specific Federal code to

14

govern those kinds of matters on Corps land.

15

QUESTION:

The Corps --

Yes, but how can that all survive the

16

provision in section 4 that the water areas shall be open

17

to public use generally without charge for boating,

18

swimming, bathing, fishing, and so forth?

1

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that, first of all, that

20

without -- I think that that is directed toward the Corps,

21

and that was Congress' prescription to the Corps that it

22

should not make charges for access to these areas.

23

Congress specifically indicated that it wanted to continue

24

regulation of hunting and fishing.

-- some regulation of hunting and fishing is necessary in

order to preserve the stock of fish and game on the land.

2

Really, some system with certain seasons and certain types

3

of animals and fish being taken at certain times is

4

required or you won't have any fishing or any hunting --

5

QUESTION:

Well, and -- I'm sorry.

6

QUESTION:

I just assume it means without charge

MR. FELDMAN:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

Anyway, Mr. Feldman, that sentence

10

goes on to say as -- shall be maintained when such use is

11

determined by the Secretary of the Army not to be contrary

12

to the public interest, all under such rules and

13

regulations as the Secretary of the Army may deem

14

necessary, which is why I think that provision of C.F.R.

15

is so crucial here.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

17

QUESTION:

That's right.

They don't really have to allow any

18

fishing at all if they don't think it's in the public

19

interest.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct, and generally

21

speaking, if the Corps, for instance, felt that the flood

22

control or irrigation purposes of this project would be

23

disserved by permitting people on some area of it or on

24

the whole thing, then they could prohibit any hunting and

25

fishing on the project.

necessary in these circumstances anyway.

I am not sure what part of the record that

counsel for the Government is referring to in regard to a

suggesting that their ordinances did not have effect over
