ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM MALLORY KENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KENT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

This Court has framed the question presented in

12

Mr. Stinson's case as whether a court's failure to follow

13

Sentencing Guideline commentary that gives specific

14

direction that the offense of unlawful possession of a

15

firearm by felony is not a crime of violence under

16

Sentencing Guideline, section 4B1.1, and seeing section

17

4B.1.2's commentary note to whether that failure

18

constitutes an incorrect application of the Sentencing

19

Guidelines under 18 U.S.C. section 3742(f) (1).

20

First, some background, the chronology.

Mr.

21

Stinson committed his crimes, which included being a felon

22

in possession of a firearm unlawfully, in October-November

23

of 1989.

24

applying the November 1989 Sentencing Guideline manual,

25

section 4B1.1, and the district court treated the felon in

Mr. Stinson was sentenced in July of 1990,

1

possession of a firearm charge as the necessary predicate

2

for the career offender provision of the Sentencing

3

Guidelines.

4

Then, in October of 1991, the Eleventh Circuit

5

affirmed the district court's sentence, affirmed the

6

sentence of a career fender -- offender, treating the

7

predicate offense of possession of a firearm by a felon as

8

a crime of violence.

9

Then just days after the Eleventh Circuit's

10

opinion came out affirming the sentence, on November 1st,

11

1991 the United States Sentencing Commission issued

12

clarifying commentary, and that was amendment 433 stating

13

that it was the Sentencing Commission's intent that the

14

definition of crime of violence, for career offender

15

purposes, did not include the crime of possession of a

16

firearm by a felon.

17

In a timely manner, before Mr. Stinson's

18

judgment and sentence was final on appeal, Mr. Stinson

19

petitioned for rehearing to the Eleventh Circuit, basing

20

his petition for rehearing on this clarifying amendment.

21

In March of 1992 the Eleventh Circuit in an opinion denied

22

the petition for rehearing, holding that the Eleventh

23

Circuit would not be bound by Sentencing Commission

24

commentary.

last term, held that a court's failure to follow

2

Sentencing Commission policy statements can result in a

3

misapplication of the Guidelines under section 3742(f).

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Kent, I understand the

5

Government to essentially agree that a commentary that

6

plausibly interprets the Guideline is binding on the

7

sentencing court.

8

MR. KENT:

Yes, ma'am.

9

QUESTION:

And to agree to with you that a

10

court's failure to follow such a commentary would be an

11

incorrect application of the Guidelines.

12

MR. KENT:

That is --

13

QUESTION:

But I think the Government then says,

14

however, here any -- this commentary should not be applied

15

retroactively in these circumstances.

16

address that?

So are you going to

17

MR. KENT:

Yes, ma'am.

18

QUESTION:

Is that question presented and -- and

19

should we decide it here?

20

MR. KENT:

Yes, this Court should decide.

21

QUESTION:

The court below didn't address it.

22

MR. KENT:

No, it did not, but the question is

23

necessarily subsumed in the question that has been

24

accepted for cert by this Court.

25

that the Government has conceded, in effect, that Mr.

The Justice is correct

1

Stinson's position is correct, that commentary should have

2

controlling weight.

3

QUESTION:

4
5

So this case may turn on the

retroactivity question.
MR. KENT:

Yes, Justice.

I would not refer to

6

it as retroactivity.

Our position is that the commentary,

7

as clarifying commentary --by definition, clarifying

8

means that the Sentencing Commission was intending to
explain what the meaning of this Guideline was.

That is,

10

what the meaning of this Guideline was at the time Mr.

11

Stinson was sentenced in July of 1

12

QUESTION:

0.

That may well be, but -- but Congress

13

can enact a piece of legislation which it calls clarifying

14

legislation and we will not apply that retroactively.

15

They can -- they can call it that, but if, in fact, we had

16

interpreted the prior legislation to mean X and the

17

clarifying legislation says we really meant it to mean Y,

18

or at least that's what we now want it to mean, we're --

1

we're not going to go and apply that retroactively.

20

MR. KENT:

Justice Scalia, if the -- if the

21

Sentencing Commission's characterization was plainly

22

inconsistent with the act that it took, then this Court

23

would not be bound by it.

24

that the Government has advanced, that the commentary of

25

the Sentencing Commission has controlling weight and must

But I think that the position

1

be deferred to by the courts unless it is clearly

2

erroneous or plainly inconsistent with the - - with the

3

law, that same position requires this Court, and the

4

Eleventh Circuit, to give deference to the Sentencing

5

Commission's characterization of this particular

6

clarifying amendment.

7

QUESTION:

But it seems to me, Mr. Kent, that

8

what this so-called clarifying commentary describes is

9

that it clarifies the new and now current sentencing

10

regime for felons in possession.

11

to me, clarify the former regime as it was in place when

12

this defendant was sentenced.

13

scheme adopted for -- for felons in possession, and so I'm

14

not sure that it would be appropriate at all to apply this

15

so-called clarifying commentary to this defendant, who was

16

sentenced under the old regime.

17
18

MR. KENT:

And it did not, it seems

I mean, there is a new

Justice O'Connor, I have two

responses to that.

19

QUESTION:

Okay.

20

MR. KENT:

First, the Sentencing Commission has

21

twice described this commentary as clarifying.

22

second time that it was addressed --

23

QUESTION:

And in the

Yes, but what does it clarify?

It

24

seems to me it clarifies what the meaning should be under

25

the new regime.

MR. KENT:

1

Justice O'Connor, it's our position

2

that this clarification is drawn out from the definition

3

that went into effect in November of 1989.

4

an evolving structure of Guidelines that relate to

5

firearm-related offenses.

There has been

But it's our position that there has never been

6

7

the intent, as least since November of 1989, by the

8

Sentencing Commission and by Congress which approved the

9

Guideline definition in effect in November of '89, that

10

the career offender crime of violence definition was

11

intended to include possession of a firearm by a -- by a

12

felon.

13

The - - there was only one change in the

14

definition of crime of violence in the history of the

15

career offender provision.

16

into effect November of 1989, and that change of

17

definition, November of 1989, was an attempt -- and

18

there's further commentary that accompanied that change in

19

definition -- an attempt to make crime of violence be

20

understood from a generic, or, we'd say, a per-se

21

approach, and to limit district courts from looking at the

22

underlying actual conduct.

23

25

QUESTION:

That change in definition went

Did that -- I'm sorry, finish.

I

thought you were done.
MR. KENT:

If I may.

The definition that was

was taken from

And that definition carried over from

24(e)

itself is a definition that -- I don't have the language

verbatim, but the definition begins by saying that a crime

the use or carrying of a firearm that, and then the

definition continues with a conjunction.
10
11

There has to be

some additional element, some acts of violence.
It's our position that the clear intent of the

now twice -- in taking over than

QUESTION:

24(e) definition was to

24(e) definition permanently.

Well, I thought there was a statute

16

that tells the district courts to apply policy statements

17

in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.

18

a statute that tells the court to do that and they've done

1

that here, I mean presumably.

20

MR. KENT:

There's

Well, I think that the Government --

21

if Justice O'Connor is referring to the Government's

22

argument that 3553 -- title 18, 3553 requires a sentencing

23

court to apply the Sentencing Guidelines in effect --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. KENT:

Policy statements.
-- In policy statements in effect on

1

the date of sentencing, it reads too much into that

2

statute to say that that governs a court of appeals'

3

application of post - sentencing clarifying commentary or

4

policy statements, reads too much into the statute.

5

Sentencing Commission itself, in Guideline 1B1.11(b)(2),

6

has acknowledged this sort of dichotomy between clarifying

7

and nonclarifying commentary, and has directed courts to

8

apply clarifying commentary.
QUESTION:

9

Can one tell immediately the

10

difference between clarifying and nonclarifying

11

commentary?
MR. KENT:

12

The

Well, judicial review of course.

13

14

determination finally.

15

position that the characterization of the Sentencing

16

Commission is owed great deference if

But, Mr. Chief Justice, it's our

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Kent.

18

QUESTION:

If the Sentencing Commission

I'm sorry.

19

describes the commentary as clarifying, then the courts

20

ought to accept it if it's within the ballpark.
MR. KENT:

21

I

Unless it's plainly inconsistent with

22

what the Sentencing Commission's done.

For example, in

23

November of 1989 the Sentencing Commission did change its

24

commentary with reference to the definition of crime of

25

violence.

Previously, courts were directed in the

1

2

commentary to look to the underlying conduct and to see

3

whether there were acts of violence in the actual conduct.

4

An example was given of an escape, and the courts were

5

directed in the commentary to look to the actual conduct.

6

Was the escape a violent escape by the acts that were

7

committed or not?

8

November of 1989, and the courts were limited to look at

9

the count of conviction, the language in the -- in the

10

That commentary was also changed in

indictment.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Kent.

12

MR. KENT:

That's a change.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Kent, am I not correct that the

14

Sentencing Commission itself could -- could clarify all of

15

this?

16

when we said clarifying, we meant thus and so, and it

17

should be applied that way retroactively?

18

they not do that?

The clarify -- the Sentencing Commission could say

Can they -- can

19

MR. KENT:

They can.

20

QUESTION:

Frankly, I was content to let them do

21

that.

And I thought that - - that when we granted

22

certiorari in this case with a reformulated question, we

23

reformulated the -- the question on certiorari, we

24

intended to exclude, I thought, the issue of what exactly

25

the commentary meant, whether it meant clarify in the

1

sense that you say or clarify in some other sense.

I

2

thought the only question we -- we wanted to take this

3

case for was whether a court must follow the commentary,

4

whatever the commentary might -- might mean.

5

what the question presented says?

Isn't that

6

MR. KENT:

Yes, sir.

7

QUESTION:

So why don't we - - why don't we just

8

talk about that and let the Sentencing Commission worry

9

about all the rest?

10

Couldn't we handle this case that

way?
MR. KENT:

11

Well, Justice Scalia,

I think the

12

Sentencing Commission already has -- has handled the rest

13

in amendment 461 where the Sentencing Commission in

14

September of 1992 -QUESTION:

15

Well that may be.

We can let the

16

lower court figure that out.

17

the lower court you have to pay attention to the

18

commentary, which they said they didn't have to do at all,

19

and then - - and then let them decide what the commentary

20

means.

21

We can just decide -- tell

But you're asking us to decide what the

22

commentary means.

Frankly, that's a -- that's a very hard

23

question and,

24

think we should spend our time on that.

25

Sentencing Commission should spend its time on that.

for my part,

I -- I don't want to - - I don't

I think that the
It

1
2

has full power to make those decisions retroactively.
MR. KENT:

Well, Justice Scalia, I -- I believe

3

the Sentencing Commission has tried to express that

4

already in amendment 461 where the Sentencing Commission

5

directly referred to this case, Stinson, and reiterated

6

their explanation that the amendment, 433, was clarifying.

7

This was - - and then 2 months later in November

8

of 1992, the Sentencing Commission adopted a Guideline,

9

1B1.11(b)(2), which explains what the significance of this

10

word "clarifying" is, and the courts are directed to apply

11

clarifying amendments.

12

Commission has already answered the question, but I

13

believe the Eleventh Circuit's unwilling to -- to abide by

14

the answer the Sentencing Commission has given.

So I think the Sentencing

15

This Court recently granted cert - -

16

QUESTION:

But not because they -- not because

17

they disagree with you about the meaning of "clarifying."

18

They -- they were much more categorical, weren't they?

19

They just say we don't --we don't have to pay any

20

attention to the commentaries.

21

MR. KENT:

Their holding was limited to their --

22

the Eleventh Circuit will not follow commentary that

23

overrules their prior precedent.

24

has just recently -- this Court granted cert in a case

25

called Morrill, M-o-r-r-i-1-1, versus United States.

But the Eleventh Circuit

1

And in a memorandum order this Court reversed or

2

directed the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider a case called

3

Jones, United States v. Jones, in which the Eleventh

4

Circuit had held that being a bank teller per se triggers

5

the vulnerable victim enhancement under the Guidelines.

6

On remand, the Eleventh Circuit en banc has reversed

7

Jones, but has stated that the Eleventh Circuit hasn't

8

decided yet whether clarifying commentary has to be

9

applied retroactively or not.

10

And that that question is on cert before the

11

Supreme Court in this case.

12

give direction at this time on that issue.

13

is necessarily subsumed within the question that was

14

presented by the Court in its reformulation of the issue.

15

QUESTION:

I believe this Court needs to
And the issue

Whatever we said about it could be

16

contradicted by the --by the --by the Sentencing

17

Commission, couldn't it?

18

MR. KENT:

It could be - -

19

QUESTION:

Now, we could come out with a

20

decision, the Sentencing Commission could say no, we

21

really didn't mean that, we meant the opposite, and

22

moreover this view that we now express should be applied

23

retroactively, right?

24

would be a nullity.

25

MR. KENT:

Whereupon our decision would be --

Well, yes, Justice Scalia, you

1

yourself, in the Braxton opinion, deferred to the

2

Sentencing Commission, of course, on a question on which

3

cert had already been granted, because the Sentencing

4

Commission had agreed to take up that issue.
But here, to repeat myself, I think the

5
6

Sentencing Commission already has addressed this issue and

7

has given the answer, and I would simply ask this Court to

8

follow that answer in its instruction for the remand.

9

That is the remand instruction should require the court to

10

apply this clarifying commentary to Stinson's sentence

11

because Stinson's sentence was not yet final on appeal at

12

the time the commentary came out.
QUESTION:

13
14

And the Sentencing Commission has --

has said that the courts may apply that 433 retroactively.

15

MR. KENT:

Yes, sir.

16

QUESTION:

But does it say "may" or "must?"

MR. KENT:

Well, Justice White, that gets

But also, I believe

the original amendment, 433 itself, which was

MR. KENT:

Exactly, Justice White.

I believe

this is just --as Justice Scalia said in Braxton, noted

that the Sentencing Commission was given this unusual

power to decide even that sentences could be reduced

retroactively, and that is what's been done in this case.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

We agree with the petitioner that the Sentencing

to deference from the courts.

an even more pro-deference position than the petitioner

does.
In our view, the court should give effect to the

Guidelines in the same way that the courts would give

In fact, we think that's a reasonable

The Sentencing Guidelines can reasonably be

analogized to a Federal agency's legislative rules.

11

all, the Guidelines are not just a collection of advice to

12

district courts about how to impose sentence in criminal

cases.

15

the exercise of their sentencing authority, such as the

For example,

there are certain times when Congress will

refer to guidelines and other times when Congress will

3

refer to policy statements.
For example,

in one of the statutes that we've

5

cited that is relevant, we think, to the proper

6

disposition of this case, section 3582(c)(2), which we

7

have reprinted in our appendix beginning at page 5a,

8

Congress has set forth a procedure that is to be followed

9

so that a sentence that is already imposed can thereafter

10

be reduced if the Sentencing Commission reduces the

11

offense level for that sentence.
If you flip over to page 6a,

We didn't argue to the contrary in the court of

at the rehearing stage in the Eleventh Circuit was that it

MR. LARKIN:

No.

So are there different kinds

I think -- I think the

Commission is using the term legislative history perhaps

in a different way than this Court is.

7

history oftentimes will sometimes explain how a statute is

The legislative

That happened frequently with respect
There was a rather

10

comprehensive report by the Senate committee that was

11

issued -- that accompanies the Sentencing Reform Act, and

12

it gave rather a elaborate explanation of how the Congress

13

thought its provisions would work.

14

And in this case, I think what the Sentencing

15

Commission is getting at is when we issue an explanation

16

of how a Guideline should be implemented, you should look

17

to it the same way you look - - you would look to a

18

legislative report explaining how a statute is to be

And that is as

1

Mr. Larson, what -- what you're

2

proposing to us is really not, however -- I don't think it

3

is -- the way we would apply an agency's interpretation of

4

its own regulations.

5

regulation is on appeal to a court of appeals and while

6

it's on appeal the agency issues a -- a new regulation or

7

a policy statement interpreting its own regulation, or

8

there's some decision of the agency that makes clear the

9

official agency interpretation of the regulation, wouldn't

If -- if a case involving a

either one of two things happen?
Number one, the -- the court of appeals itself

11

12

would take notice of that new - - of that newly issued

13

agency interpretation and decide the case on that basis.

14

Or number two, remand to the -- to the trial court for

15

that court to take account of the agency's new

16

authoritative interpretation. Isn't that the way it would

17

happen?

18

MR. LARKIN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LARKIN:

That's right, it would.
So why is this different?
Because here we have a statute that

21

sets out the relevant agency's interpretation.

22

to be considered the statute --

23

QUESTION:

And it's

Well, why we -- we have a statute

24

that says the trial court shall decide the case on the

25

basis of the law at the time.

But that just states a

truism.

I mean, you expect the same thing for agency

2

regulations too, don't you?

3

MR. LARKIN:

Well, no.

Here the reason that

4

Congress has set out a specific manual, as it turns out,

5

to be applied.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LARKIN:

Yeah.
Is that the Commission has a

8

continuing responsibility to revise -- to monitor the

9

implementation of the Guidelines, make revisions where

10

necessary, and to have those revisions injected into the

11

stream of cases that are being decided.
If you retroactively applied every revision that

12

3

came along, you would needlessly burden the system in

4

cases where the Commission didn't believe that prior

5

adjudications were -- were erroneous or unjust.

No, I understand that and it makes

sense.

But -- but I'm just saying it really is not -- I

don't believe it's the way we would treat an agency's

interpretation of its own regulation.

11

whether the analogy you're inviting us to make is -- is a

12

sound one.
MR. LARKIN:

13

I just wonder

Well, the purpose of the analogy

14

we're drawing is to the -- to the substantive weight to be

you're talking about is really more a procedural or timing

1

MR. KENT:

2

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court again:

4

The point that Justice Scalia was making, I

5

think I addressed this or the Second Circuit has in the

6

Carter case, and this is at page 29 of my brief.

7

quoted from the opinion in which the court, Second

8

Circuit, stated "Effective November 1, 1992, a revision to

9

section 1B1.10(d) of the Sentencing Guidelines establishes

And I

10

retroactively that a felon-in-possession conviction under

11

section 922(g)(1) is never a crime of violence for

12

purposes of section 4B1.1," thereby undercutting the

13

Government's position.

14

After oral argument and upon learning of this

15

revision, the Government informed this court that it does

16

not oppose remand or resentencing in conformity with this

17

Guideline's amendment.

18

resentencing.

19

Second Circuit meant by that, but I believe that what that

20

meant was that they were remanding for resentencing in

21

conformity with the amendment and that the

22

defendant/appellant would be sentenced not as a career

23

offender.

24
25

Accordingly, we remand for

Now, it's not absolutely clear what the

sentence.

7

It said that this procedure -- 3582, title 18,

The Government

And that's my point exactly, that Mr. Stinson's

8

sentence was not yet final on appeal.

Mr. Stinson does

9

not have to resort to this discretionary remedy under

10

3582.

And it is discretionary and the Government itself

11

is arguing that he shouldn't be entitled to the exercise

12

of that discretion in his favor.

3

QUESTION:

Well, if you through this other

4

procedure it's discretionary with the trial court whether

5

it -- whether it will make the change or not.

6

MR. KENT:

Exactly.

Now, as to whether this

7

Court should dispose of this issue simply by taking the

8

Government's concession and remanding up for the Eleventh

9

Circuit to determine, then, what it will do once it's

10

directed that commentary or at least this particular

11

commentary has controlling weight.

12

The Eleventh Circuit, though, hasn't decided yet

13

what -- how clarifying commentary is to be applied.

14

Justice White noted in dissenting to the denial of cert in

15

the case of Early v. United States back in October of 1991

16

that although the clear majority of the circuits are

17

applying clarifying commentary retroactively, so to speak,

18

not all of them are.

19

And although the Eleventh Circuit has on

20

occasion -- I noted one in my brief, Gardiner, and there's

21

been a subsequent case, Dedecker, in which the Eleventh

22

Circuit has applied clarifying commentary retroactively,

23

MR. KENT:

3

Well, we would come up against the

4

problem, though, Justice White, of does this particular

by the Government in its brief, and it's a question

Does this particular commentary apply to

ripe for decision by this Court now.
QUESTION:

Well,

it -- it applies, but the

it's -- it's possible that the

district court could have imposed a worse sentence.
QUESTION:

20

Well, then I -- I can't imagine why
