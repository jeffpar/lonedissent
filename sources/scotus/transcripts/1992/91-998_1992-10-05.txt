ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

Home office expenses are a conceptual hybrid of

12

business expenses, which are generally deductible, and

13

personal expenses, which generally are not.

14

most courts concluded that the expenses of a home office

15

may be deducted if the office was appropriate and helpful

16

to the taxpayer's business.

17

concluded that that broad standard should be rejected

18

because it was too difficult to administer and too prone

19

to abuse.

20

the Internal Revenue Code to establish a detailed set of

21

restrictive criteria for home office deductions.

22

relevant to this case, the statute now permits a deduction

23

only if the home office is used exclusively as the

24

taxpayer's principal place of business.

25

Prior to 1976

In 1976, however, Congress

In its place Congress enacted Section 280A of

approximately 70 percent of his time administering medical

2

services to patients at hospitals, principally at Suburban

3

Hospital in Bethesda.

4

percent of his time doing paperwork related to his

5

practice in an office at his home.

He also spends approximately 30

The tax court and court of appeals held that the

6

7

doctor's home office constitutes his principal place of

8

business under the statute because the office is essential

9

to the doctor's business, he spends a substantial amount

10

of time there, and he maintains no other office.

11

statute, however, does not permit a deduction merely

12

because essential and substantial work-related tasks are

13

performed at home.

14

home office be the taxpayer's principal place of business.

15

The

Instead it plainly requires that the

As this Court has consistently held, the words

16

of revenue statutes should, where possible, be given their

17

ordinary meaning, and in Malat v. Riddell this Court held

18

that in ordinary usage the word principal is synonymous

19

with primary or of first importance.

20

language of Section 280A, therefore, the courts must make

21

a comparison of each of the various locations in which the

22

taxpayer conducts his business to determine which one of

23

them is primary or of first importance.

2

here, do you suppose?
MR. JONES:

There is a legal standard that must

3

be met, which is what I just described, that the home be

4

the most important place of business.

5

findings of the tax court or the district court are

6

reviewed on a clearly erroneous basis.

7

QUESTION:

The factual

Do you think there can be only one

8

principal place of business under the statute?

9

that the notion?

10

MR. JONES:

I mean, is

Yes, that is the logical result of

11

the language, and in fact as this Court held in Malat v.

12

Riddell, principal means most important.

13

two places that are most important.

14

QUESTION:

You can't have

Under the Fourth Circuit view and

15

test that we're reviewing do you think it leaves it open

16

to find more than one principal place of business?

17

MR. JONES:

Certainly, as the Court also held in

18

Malat v. Riddell, the word substantial cannot be equated

19

with principal.

20

Internal Revenue Code which required a finding as to what

21

was the taxpayer's primary purpose in holding certain

22

property, and the Court held in Malat that a finding that

23

the taxpayer had a substantial purpose of holding the

24

property did not satisfy the requirement of what was his

25

principal purpose.

That case involved a provision of the

QUESTION:

Doesn't the Commissioner -- the

6

Commissioner says that he has to determine where the

7

principal place of business is, but you just said that you

8

have to compare what goes on in the various places and how

9

important they are and things like that.

So you

10

apparently then in applying the statute apply the same

11

test that the tax court does.

12

MR. JONES:

No.

The tax courts had two tests,

13

and we don't recommend either one of them.

14

the test that the tax court applied was they developed as

15

a rule that if the office is essential to the taxpayer's

business - -

MR. JONES:

Don't you apply that?
Yes, sir.

But they do --

So you do have the same general test.
We start out at the same point.
Isn't that right?
Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

Well, that's all I wanted to know.

2

You apply the same test, and you think the court of

3

appeals misapplied it here.

4

MR. JONES:

No, sir, we don't apply -- they --

5

the tax court and the court of appeals applied two tests.

6

They said they were going to look at the facts and

7

circumstances of each case, which we think is the

8

appropriate beginning point.

9

can answer each case by concluding that if the home office

But then they said that we

is essential, you need an office, and if there is a

11

substantial use made of that office, and if no other

12

office is used by the taxpayer, that will be his primary

13

place of business.

14

below that we object to.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

That is the portion of the opinions

Well, that's just a misapplication of

the same test you used.
MR. JONES:

It's possible to view it that way,

18

Justice White, but actually we think that the tax court

19

resurrected a sub standard, a legal standard that if met

20

satisfies, in their view, the statute.

21

sub standard is wrong, and that is the issue that we

22

presented to the Court on certiorari.

23

QUESTION:

And we think their

May I ask you, Mr. Jones, do you

24

measure the, do you get your answer solely by looking at

25

the amount of time spent in the various locations?

MR. JONES:

1

No, we agree with the basic

2

principle described by Meiers and Weissman and in the

3

proposed regulations, which is that you look to both the

4

time spent and the importance of the activities at each

5

location.
QUESTION:

6

7

Well, in this particular case I guess

the doctor had three hospitals he went to - -

8

MR. JONES:

9

QUESTION:

That's correct.
-- and one of them a lot more time

10

was spent than in the office.

Supposing he went to eight

11

hospitals and each of them he spent less time than the

12

home office, precisely the same amount of time in the home

13

office that he did in this case.

Would he then prevail?

14

MR. JONES:

Well, I have two answers to that.

15

QUESTION:

16

(Laughter.)

17

MR. JONES:

18

QUESTION:

You can't give both.

19

QUESTION:

Those are his two answers.

20

MR. JONES:

One, it's either yes or no.

Well, no, actually --

Those are my two answers.

(Laughter.)

determination of two things.

finder could conclude in that scenario that his home was

11

his principal place of business, but I wish to point -QUESTION:

That's a

conclusion of law.

14

MR. JONES:

Well, the finding is that he spends,

15

is how much time he spends at various locations and how

16

important those are, and then from those -QUESTION:

18

Jones.

20

Washington and one in New York, and have them come out

21

differently?

I want this -- really you can't -- can you have

MR. JONES:

Fact finders sometimes don't agree

23

even on the same record, but we think that there are sub

24

standards that the courts can look to that will resolve

25

the ordinary case.

The fact finder

is necessarily a correct answer, although I - QUESTION:

6

Is the problem that you have in

7

answering Justice Stevens' question the concession that I

8

believe you made in your brief that there is always a

9

principal place of business?
MR. JONES:

10

Well, that was the second answer I

11

was going to give Justice Stevens, which is that this is

12

not a statute in which the Government has to establish

13

where the principal place of business is.

14

statute where the taxpayer has to establish that his home

15

is his principal place of business.

16

QUESTION:

This is a

Well, do you concede that there is

17

always a principal place of business or do you argue that

18

in some cases, say in Justice Stevens' hypothetical or a

19

traveling salesman who just goes to 100 different places,

20

that there is no principal place of business at all?
MR. JONES:

21

Taking the word most important to

22

its logical extreme you would think that in almost every

23

case a fact finder could find a location that was most

24

important.

your position.

2

before us there is somewhere out there a principal place

3

of business?

4

Is it your position that in the case

MR. JONES:

Our position under the statute is

5

that the taxpayer has not established that his home is his

6

principal place of business and that is all that this case

7

requires.

8

found that the hospital is necessarily his most important

9

place of business.

It is also our position and the tax courts have

The tax court found that while the

10

doctor's activities in his house were essential to his

11

medical practice they were, and I quote, ancillary to the

12

primary income generating services he performed as an

13

anesthesiologist at the hospitals.

14

held on the same basic facts in the Pomarantz case, the

15

location where you spend the most of your time doing your

16

most important business functions is necessarily your

17

principal place of business.

18

QUESTION:

As the Ninth Circuit

I am correct that in your brief you

19

conceded the proposition that at least in this case there

20

is a principal place of business, is that not correct?

21

MR. JONES:

In this case we affirmatively state

22

that the hospital, Suburban Hospital, is his principal

place of business, yes, sir.

Mr. Jones, the tax court majority

found for the taxpayer and the dissenters in the tax court

criticized the majority for having adopted kind of a facts

16

it is strictly a facts and circumstances test.

And yet I gather that you really think

MR. JONES:

Chief Justice Rehnquist,

I think

18

that the dissent in the tax court and in the court of

19

appeals criticized the majorities for having adopted this

20

test based upon essential need,

21

true that when the tax court started out writing its

opinion it said we're going to look to facts and

QUESTION:

1

So you think that the majority in the

tax court applied the right test, they just didn't get the

right result?
MR. JONES:

direction but they went a step that was not, that cannot

simply to the location where goods and services are

QUESTION:

14

MR. JONES:

You think that's wrong?
We think that that's wrong.

The

15

statute by referring to principal place of business

16

doesn't exclude management activities as a matter of

17

course.

QUESTION:

Well, if you're not going to exclude

Why?

MR. JONES:

It

The principal place of business

requires some reference to what it is he is doing.
QUESTION:

12

Well of course, but you're admitting

13

that, as I understand it, that what you call management

14

activities or the place of management activities may

15

qualify as the principal place of business, and once you

16

do that I don't know why your insistence on some

17

qualitative sense of importance is anything but just

18

injecting a kind of wild card for the fact finder.
MR. JONES:

19

It is not in our view a wild card.

20

In our view it is a fundamental relationship to what

21

Congress sought to do.

22

allow a deduction not simply because the taxpayer used the

office a lot, but only when it was his principal place of

3

because you think the concert hall was the principal place

of business.

5

as much as practice, or what?

6

MR. JONES:

Now, you disagree with that

Why, because performance is worth 10 times

Well, actually Drucker is a good

7

example of the point.

Drucker, we're willing to assume

8

that the importance of the function of performing compared

9

to the function of practice is closer than in Dr.

10

Soliman's case where we think that the provision of

11

medical services is much greater compared to sending the

12

bills out.

13

Our real problem with the Drucker case is not

14

with the legal standard it applied.

15

think is the law, that you look to where the dominant

16

portion of the work was performed considering the time and

17

the importance of the activities involved.

18

with Drucker is not with the legal standard but with the

19

court's management of the record in that case.

20

Graphlin decided that case based upon an aphorism.

21

started out the decision by telling a story of the

22

musician who is walking down the street of New York.

23

stranger stops him and asks him what's the best way to get

24

to Carnegie Hall, and the musician answers practice,

I

it means that there's no other place he could have used.

done is set up a test that will determine whether or not a

taxpayer's home office is a principal place of business.

There is simply no basis to conclude that Congress

QUESTION:

4

Mr. Sokolow, one of the provisions of

5

280A(c)(1) is that it doesn't have to be the principal

6

place of business but it is sufficient if it is a place of

7

business when what occurs there is that the office is used

8

by patients, clients, or customers in meeting or dealing

9

with the taxpayer.

Doesn't that suggest that, although

10

perhaps you can't have a rigid point of sale or point of

11

performance of services test, nonetheless the point of

12

sale or the point of performing the services is of

13

enormous importance to Congress, if you're talking about

14

congressional intent?
What this statute says is even if it's not your

15
16

principal place of business, if it's a place of business

17

where you're selling the goods or performing the services

18

we'll allow a deduction for that.

19

that what counsel for the Government was saying has some

20

truth in it, that it isn't just adding up time, that

what's very significant in following congressional intent

is where the services are provided or where the goods are

I think that there's room under the

slightly more where the income is generated, really adds

that much to the fundamental inquiry of where is the most
