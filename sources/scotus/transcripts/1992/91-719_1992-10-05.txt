ORAL ARGUMENT OF IAN G. SONEGO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

Okay, go

MR. SONEGO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns Ricky Raley's 1986 conviction

11
12

as a persistent felony offender under Kentucky law.

13

conviction was based on two prior guilty plea convictions.

14

On the 1981 conviction the record was a plea negotiation

form.

evidence of those two prior convictions.

plea was recommitted by counsel and that he was guilty of

should bear the burden of proof to demonstrate the

2

invalidity of the prior conviction.

3

Court has ruled that the validity of a prior conviction

4

under the persistent felony offender law is not an element

5

of the offense, and that ruling should be binding on the

6

Federal court under this Court's opinion in Martin v.

7

Ohio.
Further, the ruling of the Kentucky Supreme

8

9

The Kentucky Supreme

Court is fully consistent with the analysis employed by

10

this Court in Lewis v. United States under the Federal

11

convicted felony possession of firearm law.
QUESTION:

12

Well, Mr. Sonego, the Kentucky

13

Supreme Court allows a defendant to make some sort of

14

challenge to the validity of a prior conviction under this

15

statute, doesn't it?

16

MR. SONEGO:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It

17

must be by a pretrial motion and it's a hearing conducted

18

outside the presence of the jury and decided by the judge

19

as a matter of law.

20

the Kentucky Supreme Court believes it is compelled to do

21

so under the opinions of this Court in allowing such a

22

challenge.

23

QUESTION:

But it's also clear, of course, that

So you don't think it was just

24

interpreting Kentucky's, the Kentucky recidivous statute

25

when it said that you can make that sort of challenge?

MR. SONEGO:

No, Your Honor, the Commonwealth

2

contends that the Kentucky Supreme Court was viewing

3

itself compelled by decisions of this Court.

4

cited the case of Commonwealth v. Gadd where the court

5

discusses the fact that the prior, the validity of the

6

prior conviction is not an element of the offense itself

7

and believes itself compelled to allow a pretrial

8

challenge in order to comport with due process rulings by

9

this Court.

10

QUESTION:

We have

So the Commonwealth wants something

11

more favorable to it from this Court than they've got even

12

from the Supreme Court of Kentucky, say nothing of the

13

Sixth Circuit?

14

MR. SONEGO:

Well, Your Honor, of course this

15

Court could reverse on much narrower grounds.

16

the Commonwealth would be happy with a more favorable

17

ruling, but this Court could reverse on more narrower

18

grounds simply by putting the burden of proof on the

19

convicted defendant to show --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SONEGO:

Your Honor,

As the Supreme Court of Kentucky did.
That's correct, Your Honor.

That's

22

the primary issue that this Court must resolve today in

23

this case and - -

24
25

QUESTION:

I wonder if there isn't even a more

narrow ground than that, because is it not true that the

1

proceeding that we're involved in is a collateral attack

2

on the 1987 conviction?

3

MR. SONEGO:

It was a habeas corpus proceeding.

4

Yes, Your Honor, it was a habeas corpus proceeding against

5

the persistent felony offender.

6

QUESTION:

So the question in this case is

7

whether the procedure followed in Kentucky satisfies due

8

process sufficiently to defeat a collateral attack on the

9

1987 conviction, isn't that correct?

10

MR. SONEGO:

Yes, Your Honor, it is.

It is

11

actually a double-header collateral attack, if you'll

12

pardon my use of that analogy.

13

attack on the persistent felony offender conviction which

14

in turn was based on the 1981 conviction subsumed within

15

the persistent felony offender conviction.

16

point out to the Court also that according to Raley's

17

habeas corpus petition filed in this case he was still

18

serving time on the 1981 conviction when he filed that

19

habeas petition.

persistent felony offender conviction.

In fact I'm not sure it is even a

unfair to use the 1981 conviction.

conviction in order to say that was

MR. SONEGO:

In other words

Well, Your Honor, I would be, I

6

would have to agree with you that there should only be one

7

collateral attack, but clearly you are correct in saying

8

that this collateral attack was brought because of the

9

persistent felony offender conviction, not because of the

10

98

conviction.

It would appear since Mr. Raley did not

11

attack the

12

result in that situation.

QUESTION:

Could a state say that, introduce in

4

the record evidence of a conviction is conclusive proof

5

that the person was indeed convicted of the crime for

6

purposes of the persistent felony offender statute?

7

MR. SONEGO:

Yes, Your Honor, the Kentucky

8

Supreme Court has said that the judgment is sufficient to

satisfy the statute --

Could a state provide that the record

MR. SONEGO:

1

Yes, Your Honor, I think the state

2

could provide that by following the analogy of Lewis v.

3

United States in taking the position that a collateral

4

challenge would have to precede the subsequent charge.

5

QUESTION:

So that the status of being a person

6

with a record conviction is all that's needed from a

7

constitutional standpoint to suffice for your being

8

convicted under a statute like the PFO statute in

9

Kentucky?

10

MR. SONEGO:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think the

11

question about whether or not the challenge should be

12

brought prior to the subsequent offender charge being

13

filed has been discussed by some of the Federal courts

14

under the Federal sentencing guidelines, and I think there

15

may be a few states that have --

16

QUESTION:

Does the same answer apply if there

17

is a separate offense for being a PFO?

18

the state have some additional burden beyond showing

19

record evidence of the conviction?

20

MR. SONEGO:

At that point does

No, Your Honor, I don't think that

21

should make a difference.

Kentucky chooses to employ jury

22

sentencing, and for that reason requires a persistent

23

felony offender charge be included in the indictment.

24

I think Kentucky could, if it eliminated jury sentencing,

25

follow something analogous to the Federal sentencing

guidelines.
QUESTION:

2

Would your answer be the same if all

3

parties conceded that the prior conviction was obtained

4

through an unknowing plea?

5

(Pause.)
MR. SONEGO:

6

7

I interpret the cases of this Court as saying - QUESTION:

8

9

Yes, Your Honor, I think it would.

What about an uncounseled plea, there

is no counsel present?
MR. SONEGO:

10

Your Honor, I would have to, I

11

would have to say that the precedents of this Court

12

establish that a defendant may attack an uncounseled

13

guilty plea.

14
15

QUESTION:

Well, why?

What is the difference in

the two cases?
MR. SONEGO:

16

The difference is, Your Honor, the

17

defendant presumably has had the advice of counsel and

18

therefore certainly had an opportunity to discuss with

19

counsel the events leading to the guilty plea.
QUESTION:

20

Does the difference depend upon the

21

fundamentality or the gravity of the constitutional

22

violation?

23

MR. SONEGO:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that is an

24

important point to make because the Court has clearly

25

stated the right to counsel is fundamental.

It has been

1

2

applied retroactively to the criminal cases.
QUESTION:

Well, under the hypothesis we're

3

assuming that the guilty plea was uninformed, it was a

4

completely uninformed waiver.

5

from a case where there's no counsel?

6

MR. SONEGO:

Why is that any different

Your Honor, I think the difference

7

is the court has assumed that where counsel is not

8

provided it is more likely an innocent man would plead

9

guilty than otherwise.

Where counsel has been provided

10

then counsel has the opportunity to point out to the

11

defendant his rights and possible defenses that may exist,

12

the opportunity to discuss the evidence that might be

13

introduced against him, and the possible sentences that

14

may result.

15

The Commonwealth respectfully contends that

16

placing the burden of proof on a convicted defendant

17

making a collateral attack for purposes of sentencing

18

enhancement is consistent with this Court's ruling in

19

Medina v. California, where the Court ruled that the state

20

could require the defendant to demonstrate he was

21

incompetent to stand trial, and that case was also based

22

on Martin v. Ohio.

QUESTION:

24

tradition here, do you think?

MR. SONEGO:

What's the relevant historical

Your Honor, the history of the

1

precedents of the Court have directed that the denial of

2

counsel is a fundamental right permitting a collateral

3

attack on a guilty plea, and have also indicated that an

4

involuntary guilty plea may be collaterally attacked.

5

don't believe the Court has indicated any other basis for

6

a collateral attack.

7

United States v. Timmreck, direct attention to fundamental

8

defects in the proceeding that would make the resulting

9

conviction fundamentally unfair and potentially or

I

The Court's precedents, such as

10

probably result in an innocent person being convicted.

11

And certainly probable innocence is an important factor,

12

as this Court has made clear in evaluating the

13

circumstances of a collateral attack.

14

The history of the precedents of this Court

15

clearly indicate that on a collateral attack the convicted

16

defendant must bear the burden of proof.

17

clear at least since Johnson v. Zerbst in 1938 and this

18

Court has repeatedly reiterated that the burden for a

19

collateral attack should fall on the convicted defendant

20

who mounts such an attack.

21

Lockhart the Court placed the burden of proof on the

22

convicted defendant to establish ineffective assistance of

23

counsel.

24

ruling in Strickland v. Washington regarding counsel

25

provided for a trial.

That has been

Most recently in Hill v.

This was consistent with the Court's earlier

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005'
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The Court has also made it clear that a

1

2

collateral attack is not a substitute for an appeal and

3

therefore a higher standard must be applied in that

4

situation.

5

it really is a double collateral attack that is being

6

mounted in the proceedings.

7

Within the context of sentencing enhancement

QUESTION:

May I ask a question about the nature

8

of the burden you think the petitioner would have?

9

Suppose he gets on the witness stand and says the judge

10

didn't ask me any questions and I didn't understand what

11

the crime was I was charged with.

12

Does that carry his burden?

13

the state to go forward and prove otherwise?

14

MR. SONEGO:

That's all he says.

Does it shift the burden to

Yes, Your Honor, that could shift

15

the burden of proof to the prosecution, bearing in mind

16

this Court said in Marshall v. Lonberger that the

17

defendant must convince the trial court of the credibility

18

of his testimony, or whatever witnesses.

19

if I were prosecuting the case, would want to present

20

whatever evidence I had at that point and not take a

21

chance on the judge deciding the defendant was a credible

22

witness.

23

But I certainly,

But certainly, as this Court has indicated most

24

recently I guess in the dissenting opinion in Marshall, in

25

Loper v. Beto, defendant's own testimony certainly opens

serious credibility questions.

2

lower Federal courts have also indicated they have serious

3

doubts about the ease with which a defendant may come

4

forward and claim some sort of constitutional violation

5

without any corroboration.
QUESTION:

6

And I think again the

But then what if the only other

7

documentary evidence is that there was no transcript

8

prepared, even though say normally they do prepare a

9

transcript but in his case they didn't?

10

What more is he

supposed to do in your view?
MR. SONEGO:

11

Well, Your Honor, he certainly

12

could present other witnesses such as his former attorney,

13

the former judges, bystanders, Kentucky allows a bystander

14

bill.

15

since they normally occur in the courtroom.

16

that nature.

17

of the problem, of course, is that, as this Court has

18

noted, there's no time limit on a collateral attack and a

19

collateral attack may go back many years.

20

Kentucky has no prescribed time limit on making a

collateral attack.

QUESTION:

2

MR. SONEGO:

3
4

I see.
The judge could order it, but

otherwise it wouldn't be made.
QUESTION:

Mr. Sonego, when you concede that at

5

least a certain quantity of evidence would be sufficient

6

to shift the burden to the state, do you mean that it

7

would be enough to shift the burden of proof or just that

8

it would be enough to shift the burden of going forward in

9

the sense that if there's a prima facie case made and the

10

state does nothing the state presumably is going to lose

11

if the judge accepts the evidence as it appears?

12

mean then a shifting of the burden of proof or just the

13

burden of production?

14

MR. SONEGO:

Do you

Well, Your Honor, in this case the

15

Commonwealth is arguing under Johnson v. Zerbst it should

16

be the burden of proof, but certainly the opinion of the

17

Kentucky Supreme Court seemed to indicate it's simply the

18

burden of producing the evidence.

19

follows the slightly lower standard at this point.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sonego, I, my understanding is

that you did not raise below the contention that the

1

MR. SONEGO:

Well, Your Honor, the

2

Commonwealth's position is that that was inherent in our

3

argument that Dunn v. Simmons was wrongly decided and is

4

inherent in the issue of which side must bear the burden

5

of proof, because the question becomes how is that burden

6

of proof to be satisfied.

v. Lockhart from this Court also indicating that Boykin

8

was not an essential component of a valid guilty plea.

10

Cases were cited such as Hill

I will reserve the -QUESTION:

Did you make the argument below in

11

the court of appeals that for purposes of Federal habeas

12

corpus this kind of a claim was not entertainable?

13

17

MR. SONEGO:

No, Your Honor, that was not a

precise argument caption.
QUESTION:

We presented --

So you're making an argument here

that wasn't made in the court of appeals?
MR. SONEGO:

Yes, in one sense, Your Honor, but

18

we're contending that it was subsumed within the other

19

arguments presented, the argument that Dunn v. Simmons was

20

wrongly decided.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. SONEGO:

How was it subsumed?

Tell me again.

We contended that the Sixth

Circuit's opinion in Dunn v. Simmons was in error, which

24

placed the burden of proof on the Commonwealth.

MR. SONEGO:

The Sixth Circuit's opinion in Dunn

v. Simmons.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. SONEGO:

Yes.
And by asking the Sixth Circuit to

reexamine that ruling we contend that they also had to

7

reexamine whether it fared around a Boykin warning.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. SONEGO:

I see.
More recently in the McLaughlin

10

case the Sixth Circuit seems to have indicated a Boykin

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. MANNING

11

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

12

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING PETITIONER

13

15

MR. MANNING:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin by explaining what we think,

16

believe is the proper standard for evaluating this claim.

17

We believe that it's set forth in this Court's decision in

18

Chapman v. United States.

19

that a person who has been convicted is eligible and the

20

court may impose whatever punishment is authorized by

21

statute for the offense, so long as that penalty is not

22

cruel and unusual and so long as the penalty is not based

23

on some arbitrary distinction that would violate the due

24

process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

25

In that case the Court held

In this case the Kentucky Supreme Court has

from the court's decision in Commonwealth v. Gadd at page

As my

It says the fact of conviction is what the statute

7

The question is whether it is arbitrary for the

8

state to treat somebody as a persistent or repeat offender

9

on the basis of the fact of a prior conviction.

We

10

believe that it is not irrational for the state to do so

11

even if the state is unwilling to allow a collateral

12

attack in which the defendant may raise every issue that

13

he could have raised on a direct appeal of the prior

14

conviction.

15

QUESTION:

May I just ask, because I want to be

16

sure I understand you correctly, you say as a matter of

17

Kentucky law the fact of conviction is the critical thing.

18

Is that an element of the offense that must be proved

19

beyond a reasonable doubt as a matter of Kentucky law?
MR. MANNING:

20

It does have to be proved beyond a

21

reasonable doubt under Kentucky law and it is proven to

22

the jury.

23

clear that it is not, it is not dispositive that an

24

offense is, that, I'm sorry, that a persistent felony

determined beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Graham v. West

2

Virginia the Court said even though it's charged

3

separately, even though it's decided by a jury, a

4

persistent felony offense is a sentencing factor that

5

enhances the punishment.
It is not a separate offense as such.

6

And even

7

if it were the question would be the same, whether it's

8

rational for the state to treat some people as persistent

9

offenders and punish them more harshly on the ground that

10

they have prior convictions.

11

rational for the state to do so even if, as I mentioned,

12

there is not a full right to appeal.

13

this Court's cases that says that to treat somebody as a

14

persistent felony offender they have to be retried for

15

their past crimes.

16

QUESTION:

And we believe that it is

There is nothing in

Mr. Manning, do some states

17

characterize their recidivous statutes as being separate

18

offenses as opposed to sentencing enhancing, and if they

19

do are they then required to prove the prior offenses

20

beyond a reasonable doubt or is your answer still the

21

same?

22

MR. MANNING:

It depends on how they -- I mean

24

Patterson v. New York the answer is that it doesn't really

7

They are free to

There is nothing in this Court's cases that

And indeed in response to Justice O'Connor's

8

question, the history is quite to the contrary.

The

9

longstanding tradition was that states would traditionally

10

allow people charged as multiple offenders or treated and

11

sentenced as persistent offenders to attack their prior

12

convictions only on the ground that the prior conviction

13

was entered by a court without jurisdiction over the prior

14

offense, and that is evident from 25 Am Jur at page 266 to

No, Your Honor.

The rules are

21

slightly different when the conviction is uncounseled, and

22

that's evident from this Court's cases in Tucker and

Burgett.

24

the right to counsel is on a different plane from typical

25

errors that would impact a conviction.

integrity of the fact finding process.

5

QUESTION:

Is there anything else that's on that

plane?
MR. MANNING:

Well, we would suggest that the

6

kind of error would have to be a fundamental structural

7

error such as perhaps the adjudication of the case before

8

a kangaroo court or the adjudication of the case before a

9

biased judge, something that went to the very legitimacy

10

of the process and not merely cause one to doubt the

11

reliability of the conviction, but the very legitimacy of

12

the proceeding from which it was rendered.

13

the way, brings the Tucker and Burgett line of cases into

14

line with the traditional basis for providing relief from

15

final judgments of the conviction, i.e. that it was

16

rendered by a court that didn't have competent

jurisdiction.

whether it is a rational distinction to punish the second

defendant who has two convictions more heavily.

9

answer is, with the exception of fundamental errors in the

10

prior convictions such as the ones that were identified by

11

this Court's cases in Tucker and Burgett, it is entirely

rational for the states to make that differentiation and

MR. CLARE:

Isn't that wherein you say

That's how

their procedure is incorrect.

Because Boykin says that if

the record is silent as to the waiver of these

constitutional rights then it is, that conviction is void.

11

What the Sixth Circuit done, has done is to follow the

12

line of the waiver of the right to counsel cases, saying

that when the record is silent you get a hearing.

a presumption against the waiver of those constitutional

rights that are inherent in a plea of guilty.

The state in the sentencing phases

10

are within parameters in order to enhance the defendant's

11

sentence.

13

elements to be used in the sentencing phase.

This is not the same as like in the Federal

14

This, Mr. Raley is being convicted of a crime

15

and to prove the crime they must show all the elements,

16

prove all elements.

17

That's all the state said there, and that's where we go

18

back to the waiver of counsel cases.

19

the Sixth Circuit has done is to say under Boykin if the

20

record is silent it is presumed that that conviction is

21

invalid constitutionally, and then they have a hearing.

standard.

10

MR. CLARE:

My response is the same as with

11

Justice Scalia, was that by using the word convict in the

12

statute that the legislature placed in there or assumed,

13

although we cannot assume what they meant because they

14

have to state exactly, but they used the word to convict,

15

and that it would not have been an assumption to use an

invalid conviction or a constitutionally invalid

17

conviction.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I would have no problem if the,

19

you know, the Kentucky Supreme Court decided the case on

20

that basis, that when our legislature said convict it

21

meant validly convict.

that's what their legislature meant.

believe that the decision of the State of Kentucky, the

Burgett.

The State of Kentucky in essence would not allow

any defendant to come back and challenge any conviction

not under that scenario.

In fact in the case of the Supreme Court of Duke

v. Warden you all know that the waiver, or the entering of

a guilty plea is one of the most devastating waivers that

19

there is because you are giving up three constitutional

rights at one time, and the right to counsel, that you

can't put a hierarchy between those constitutional rights.

that on the habeas proceeding the defendant may be greatly
