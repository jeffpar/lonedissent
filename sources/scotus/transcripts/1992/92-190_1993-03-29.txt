ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MINEAR:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether the

12

13

McCarran Amendment allows the State of Idaho to charge the

14

United States with filing fees to pay for the costs of

15

State water rights adjudication.

16

This case has its origins in a dispute between

17

the State of Idaho and the Idaho Power Company over the

18

Company's right to use Snake River flows for power

19

development.

20

general adjudication of all water rights in the Snake

21

River Basin.

22

the McCarran Amendment, which is set forth at page 2 of

23

our brief.

Idaho ultimately decided to conduct a

specifically provided that the United States is exempt

2

from judgments for costs, which was the mechanism that

3

Idaho and other States commonly used to pay - - to pay for

4

those adjudications at that time.

5

Nevertheless, Idaho has now asserted that it can

6

charge the United States filing fees to the same end, to

7

pay for the adjudication.

8

those fees would amount to at least $10 million in this

9

litigation alone.

We originally estimated that

We have now completed filing our

10

various water rights claims with the Department of Water

11

Resources and it appears that those fees will total at

12

least $30 million.

13

We challenged Idaho's fee assessments through a

14

writ of mandamus, and the Idaho Supreme Court ultimately

15

held by a vote of 3 to 2 that the McCarran Amendment

16

requires the United States to pay those fees.

17

reversal of that judgment.

18

We seek

As this Court has repeatedly recognized, the

19

United States is immune from cost and fee assessments

unless Congress expressly provides otherwise.

parties.

The mere consent to joinder is not consent to pay

QUESTION:

5

Well, Mr. Minear, the last sentence,

6

the proviso, says no judgment for costs shall be entered

7

against the United in such a suit.

8

that these fees could be considered costs?

9

in advance, but are they the type of fee that could be

Now, is it possible

MR. MINEAR:

They certainly serve the very same

12

function as a judgment for cost.

makes that quite clear.

15

cost-sharing formula for financing the costs of

I found troublesome the Government's

20

argument that the United States isn't bound by any

procedural requirements of the State in which the water

MR. MINEAR:

1

That is

that is not our

position.

Amendment does not specifically address State procedures.

4

Now, I think that it's implicit in the join -- the notion

5

of joinder that the United States will comply with

6

reasonable procedures of the State.

7

I think our position is that the McCarran

QUESTION:

I mean there may be time limits for

procedural requirements.

10

MR. MINEAR:

11

QUESTION:

That is correct. And Idaho -And if the United States isn't bound

12

by any of those, I don't see how the litigation could

13

proceed.

14

MR. MINEAR:

Well, our position is that -- we

15

think that the McCarran Amendment does not expressly

16

address this issue, but we think that the United States is

17

bound by reasonable procedures.

18

United States reserves its right to object to any

19

procedures that are aberrant or that are hostile to

20

Federal interests.

21

But at the same time, the

So do you have some other example

States still has the right to raise objections to

2

procedures that are either unfair, which, I think, is the

3

point that you're making in terms of them being -- not

4

comporting with due process, or also procedures that are

5

directly hostile to Federal interests.

6

For instance, if -- suppose that in terms of

7

filing deadlines, the United States was subject to a

8

shorter period than other parties.

9

United States may well have the right to object to those

We think that the

types of procedures.

QUESTION:

Sure, but not on the basis of

sovereign immunity.

discriminated against.

On the base -- I mean, the -- on the

MR. MINEAR:

That's correct, that's correct.

16

QUESTION:

Okay.

17

QUESTION:

Sovereign immunity has nothing to do

18

with -- with due process, in that people who concededly

19

are subject to the jurisdiction of courts can always raise

20

a due process claim.

21

MR. MINEAR:

That -- that is correct.

Again,

22

the point here, however, is the -- the question of

23

assessment of fees.

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

Now, supposing that Idaho made

an assessment of $100 on everybody who is making an

1

appearance for the first time in a judicial proceeding in

2

Idaho, and that was applied across the board.
MR. MINEAR:

3

The question with respect to the

4

United States is whether Congress has waived its historic

5

immunity from those types of assessments.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MINEAR:

And do -And we -- and our answer is it has

8

not.

And we would look to the three provisions of the --

9

the three relevant provisions of the McCarran Act.

First

10

is the joinder provision and, as I say, all that consents

11

to is the joinder of the United States in the proceeding.

12

It does not say anything about costs or fees for which a

13

separate waiver of sovereign immunity would be required.

14

QUESTION:

You don't think there's any

15

subsidiary waiver involved when it -- when it talks about

16

being joined in a proceeding.

17

MR. MINEAR:

Not with respect to -- to fees and

18

costs.

19

cost-shifting mechanism requires a separate waiver from

20

Congress.

21

This Court has recognized those types of -- any

QUESTION:

Well, but then why does Congress say

22

at the end of this that it shall not be liable for costs,

23

if it wouldn't have been without the provision?

24
25

MR. MINEAR:

For the very reason that it -- that

the provision was attached to the third provision, the

1

so-called judgment provision, which subjects the United

2

States to the judgments of the State court.

3

believe that Congress put in the proviso to make clear

4

that that provision did not subject the United States to

5

judgments for costs.

6

It's important to remember --

7

QUESTION:

And we

Well, Mr. Minear, the -- the statute

8

permits the United States to be joined, but what that

9

means is that the - - that there can be a general

10

adjudication of a -- of water rights in the basin, but

11

only -- and what it means is that if the United States

12

wants to get water rights, they not only are joined but if

13

they did not come in and file a claim, they would have no

14

water rights.

15

MR. MINEAR:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And so it -- you -- the United States

17

conceded that it would have to to make a valid water right

18

claim in the State of Idaho.

19
20
21

22

MR. MINEAR:

In the judicial

proceeding it would have to make a claim.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

And you would have to take

the initiative.

23

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

25

It would have to.

Yes, that is correct.
And you don't think that subsumes

compliance with some rules about how you file a claim.

We believe it does not subsume

has --we require a waiver from Congress.

QUESTION:

5

MR. MINEAR:

Again, this -- Congress

Well, what if it had been a $5 fee?
If it had been a $5 fee, in all

6

likelihood we would not have challenged it because it's a

7

de minimis amount.

QUESTION:

9

MR. MINEAR:

Well, why not?
And because it - - the law does not

concern itself with trifles, as the Court said in Weltover

11

last year, that de minimis not curat lex.

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

And, also, certain types of

claims are, in fact -- or require a higher fee even though

10

there's no added expense in adjudicating those types of

And that includes the claim -- the

kind of claims the United States makes.

But, again, this --

But, again, the question here is not ultimately

one of reasonableness or fairness of the State procedures.

It's a question of whether Congress has consented to these

QUESTION:

You say -- suggest that determining

21

instream flow claims is not more complicated than just --

just adjudicating prior appropriation claims.

MR. MINEAR:

Well, with respect to the Federal

24

Government, the State does not carry any burden, in fact,

25

of even investigating those claims.

They simply take the

4

going out and investigating individual small claims.

5

So there's very little cost involved to the

But, again, we're getting, I think, removed from

6

the point that I -- I think is critical here, and that is

7

that Congress must specifically consent to the payment of

clearly that Congress was not - -

10

Let me ask you about that.

You --

13

which is just an appendage to the portion of the statute

14

that deals with the entry of judgments, doesn't have any

15

relevance to the first sentence in the section.

16

I inferred -- and you correct me if I'm wrong -- that the

17

United States is not taking the position that the filing

18

fees in this case, which are assessed before any

19

judgment's entered, are covered by the language in the

20

proviso.

21

I thought you said that the cost provision,

are not, by their terms, a judgment for costs.

is -- can be distinction between a judgment for costs --

2

not a sufficiently specific waiver of sovereign immunity

3

in the earlier part of the statute.

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

6

Ultimately, that is -Rather than arguing that this is

covered by the proviso.

7

MR. MINEAR:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MINEAR:

That is - - that is correct.
Okay.
That ultimately is correct.

And I

10

think it's important to remember that when the McCarran

11

Amendment was enacted in 1952 it was against the backdrop

12

of other well-accepted principles, including the fact that

13

the United States was not liable for fees.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, I assume I can agree with

15

you on the -- or, I hope I can agree with you, because

16

you're going to have trouble otherwise, on the -- on the

I mean how

MR. MINEAR:

Well, we think -- again, this is

2

the -- this issue arises -- our basic -- let me begin with

3

this point.

4

separate and specific waiver before fees or costs can be

5

assessed against the United States.

Our basic position is there must be a

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. MINEAR:

Right.

That's fair enough.

Now, the question of procedures was

8

brought into this case by the interpretation of Idaho of

9

the pleading provision.

There is a -- a second provision

10

says the United States, when any -- when a party to any

11

such suit, shall be deemed to have waived any right to

12

plead that the State laws are inapplicable.

13

We believe that the State laws was referring to,

14

in fact, the laws governing the appropriation of water

15

rights by - - under State law, the acquisition of water

16

rights themselves, not the laws -- not procedural laws.

17

Idaho's argument is that reference actually is referring

18

to procedural laws.

19

Our basic point is that procedure has nothing to

20

do about -- with this.

Even if you accepted that

21

provision as -- as referring to procedural laws, the

22

United States still would not be subject to fees because

23

there is not an express waiver of the United States'

24

immunity from fees.

25

QUESTION:

Well, do you think your argument as

to the express waiver by the United States of immunity

2

from fees is no stronger than the argument that you're not

3

subject to procedures because the -- there's no express

4

waiver as to procedures?
MR. MINEAR:

5
6

We think our argument with respect

to fees is much stronger.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. MINEAR:

9

QUESTION:

So do I.
Yes.
I mean I think to -- if you had said

10

that you have a right to challenge an Idaho rule that says

11

you notice a deposition a certain amount of days in

12

advance, that you go just through the whole Idaho Code of

13

Procedure saying we have to look at sovereign immunity in

14

these of these after there's been a consent to joinder, I

15

think that's rather farfetched.

16

MR. MINEAR:

17

if I've not been clear on this.

18

the question here is the United States' immunity with

19

respect to fees.

20

have - - do reserve the right to challenge them on the

21

basis that they are either unreasonable or hostile to

Federal interests, but that's not a sovereign immunity

No.

As to procedures, we believe that we do

rights that were recognized in footnote 20 of San Carlos

2

where you noticed that State procedures might be

3

inadequate to adjudicate certain types of Federal water

rights.

5

The -- the crucial question here, though, is

6

whether there has been an express waiver of fees.

And I

7

think it's important to note that in 1952 when this act

8

was enacted, Congress was quite clear that there did need

9

to be a separate waiver for -- for fees.

Then the McCarran Act doesn't really

say that the United States -- that this whole proceeding

MR. STRONG:

And that's not our contention, Your

6

Honor.

Our contention is simply that those procedures and

7

substantive parts of State law that govern the conduct of

8

general stream adjudications and suits for administration

9

is what the second sentence refers to.
To give you an example of the problem that would

10
11

encompass if that reference was not in the procedure, it

12

would be the claims filing periods, the procedures that

13

are all set forth by statute -- and you have to understand

14

that in Western States the general stream adjudications

15

are not a creature of court, but rather a creature of

16

statute.

All the aspects of those proceedings are

governed by those State statutory procedures.

20

to apply its statutory procedures to the United States.

interpretation that it only - - that the second sentence

2

only extends to those laws governing the acquisition of

3

water rights, then it would be rendering meaningless the

4

same phrase with respect to suits for administration.

5

Because in suits for administration, the issue is not the

6

acquisition of a State water right, it's a question of how

7

the decree is going to be administrated.

8

And for example, the futile call doctrine, which

9

says that if a senior water right could call for water but

10

by calling for that water there would not be sufficient

water to meet the purposes of that water right, you could

not exercise it against a junior water user.

be able to administer the particular decrees.

we're contending is simply that the State laws must refer

MR. STRONG:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

Our

2

contention is that as to the laws that govern the

3

determination of those water rights, it will be based upon

4

either Federal or State law.

5

those determinations, the McCarran Amendment is a

procedural statute that was designed to allow the States

to apply those laws that govern the conduct of their

adjudications to the United States.

it allows the imposition of filing fees, because filing

fees are part and parcel of those procedures.
One of the reasons the McCarran Amendment was

enacted was to ensure the availability of the

13

comprehensive State proceedings.

14

originally started out as a quite title action in which

15

there was an adversarial relationship, but over time the

16

Western States developed a specialized procedure that

17

moved away from that process and instead developed a

18

process that's more akin to an interpleader action or an

19

in rem action, in which all parties are brought in who may

have a claim to that resource.

which a variable fee was charged for claimants to have

That also explains why it uses the language "any

If Idaho was correct that the point of

this whole provision was to subject us to State

have said the United States shall be subject to State

Now, I think the important point in this case is

17

it's about fees and it's about costs.

18

costs -- the general costs provision of the U.S. Code said

19

this:

And in 1952, the

sovereign cannot be sued without his consent, and

that's --

3

QUESTION:

Is it remarkable that the reference

4

to fees was omitted from this proviso, whereas it was

5

included in the language from the general statute that

6

you've just quoted?

7

MR. MINEAR:

No, I don't think so, because that

8

general statute would have exempted the United States from

9

both fees and costs.

However, when Congress wrote the

10

McCarran Amendment, it also provided the second clause --

11

the second clause of the pleading provision:

12

States, when a party to any such suit, shall be subject to

13

the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having

14

jurisdiction, provided that no judgment for costs shall be

The United

Now, the purpose of the cost proviso was to make

absolutely clear that the mere fact that we are subject to

judgments for costs -- for judgments generally, did not

mean we were subject to judgments for costs.

20

explains why it -- read in the context of section 2412(a),

21

the cost proviso was inserted there, to make it absolutely

clear that the United States was not expected to pick' up

to why fees were later -- later omitted.

2

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

4

MR. MINEAR:

Yeah, yes.
The reason why -- there's simply no

common law rule would still be in effect.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but I mean they -- they

were once present in the statute, they are now omitted.
MR. MINEAR:

9

Yes.

And, in fact, it's -- I

10

suppose by negative implication what's -- what is

11

indicated is that although a prevailing party can now

12

collect costs under the present version of 2412(a), he

13

cannot collect fees.

14

statutes of the Federal Code.

15

QUESTION:

And that's reflected in the various

16

17

fee as a cost, but the Supreme Court of Idaho is certainly

18

right as to the distinction between fees and costs, I

19

think.

20

MR. MINEAR:

And a party may charge a paid

Why, I think so.

But nevertheless,

21

the United States still does not pay fees even to a court.

22

That's made clear in the notes of 28 U.S.C. 1914, for

23

instance, where it recognizes that although fees may be

24

assessed against parties, the United States does not pay

25

fees in the courts.

1

Now, that's the common law rule that's been

2

followed here, and I think that Idaho has really seized

3

upon the absence of the word filing fees to turn what used

4

to be judgments for costs into filing fees.

5

for instance, the court-appointed experts, the fact that

6

we're simply paying for a court-appointed expert.

7

court-appointed expert is an assessable cost under section

8

1920 of the judicial code.

9

a person could, in fact, get compensation for.

10

They mention,

A

That is one of the costs that

So I think it's clear that what they've really

11

done is taken a procedure whereby the State was precluded

12

from charging the United States with the expense of the

13

litigation by the cost proviso, and tried to get around

14

that by collecting the fees up front through filing --a

15

filing fee system, which may bear very little relationship

16

to the actual costs incurred.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, do you -- you implicitly,

18

then, I take it, dispute Mr. Strong's representation that

19

at the time this statute was enacted, there was in effect

20

in Idaho and other Western States the practice of charging

21

fees up front.

22

MR. MINEAR:

I believe there was no practice in

23

Idaho of charging filing fees in a court adjudication.

24

There were three States that charged filing fees in a

25

administrative adjudication, but those are not subject to

In a judicial proceeding.
