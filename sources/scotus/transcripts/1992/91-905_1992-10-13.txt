v. Jenny Lisette Flores.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

9

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

This case concerns a facial challenge to the

11

constitutionality of a program adopted by the Attorney

12

General in 1988 to govern the care and custody of

13

unaccompanied alien minors who are charged with being in

14

the United States illegally.

15

The Ninth Circuit held that this program was

16

unconstitutional in two separate respects.

17

invalidated the substantive determination that the

18

Attorney General made about who had the appropriate

19

requirements to serve as a custodian for these children.

20

And second, it invalidated the procedures that were used

21

to make that determination.

22

First, it

We respectfully request this Court to reverse

23

both rulings of the Ninth Circuit, and I would like to

24

turn first to the substantive due process issue.

25

I think that the best way to explain why the

1

program is constitutional is to explain the program.

2

Because a description of those terms reveals that this

3

program is not only supported by legitimate purposes which

4

conclusively establish its constitutionality, but, in

5

fact, these terms are far more consistent with the welfare

6

of these children than the program that was adopted by the

7

Ninth Circuit on its own.
And I think the best way to do this is just

8

9

to -- to try to describe the problem that INS confronts.

10

Every year thousands of unaccompanied minors are taken

11

into custody.

12

primarily from Haiti or from Central America.

13

they're bound for relatives in the United States,

14

sometimes they're living on the streets of Los Angeles,

15

but all of them concede -- virtually all of them -- that

16

they are here illegally.

17

These children have travelled large -Sometimes

And when INS takes them into custody it doesn't

18

want to keep them in custody, but these children all share

19

the same problem and that is that they have no home to go

20

to.

21

Now, what is INS supposed to do?.
The easiest and the cheapest thing they could do

22

is adopt the substantive policy that the Ninth Circuit

23

said they should adopt, and that is to simply release them

24

to the first willing adult who comes along and says that

25

they'll ensure that they show up for their deportation

hearing.

And that's what the Ninth Circuit said that the

2

INS must do.

3

QUESTION:

May I just interrupt.

You said the

4

policy was adopted in 1988.

5

it was 1984.

6

they had been doing this for a long time before 1984?

7

I had in the back of my mind

Whatever date it was, isn't it true that

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, this problem started

8

in the early -- in the 1980's, and there was no national

9

program to deal with the issue of the custody of

10

unaccompanied minors until 1988.

11

basically, on the basis of different districts using

12

different policies.

13

haphazard.

14

It was done on a - -

And, frankly, the system was somewhat

But the important point here is that by the time

15

the district court ruled in 1988, the policy that was at

16

issue was the national policy that is reflected in two

17

places.

18

establishes the requirements for fitness to serve as a

19

custodian.

20

govern the shelter care facilities where these children

21

have to be placed, and that's set forth in the Federal

22

Register, and it is also adopted as part of a settlement

23

agreement in this case that is binding and enforceable.

24
25

It is reflected in the regulation, 242.24, which

And it's established in the standards that

Both of those aspects of the Attorney General's
program had been adopted and were being implemented at the

time that the district court found this program to be

2

unconstitutional.

3

related to the conditions of custody, and also the program

4

that had been followed previously, were simply irrelevant

by that period of time.

And the evidence in the case that had

QUESTION:

MS. MAHONEY:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well have they -- excuse me.
Go ahead.

I was just going to ask you are they

irrelevant in the sense - - sometimes history explains why

10

a regulation is adopted.

A regulation responds to

11

problems that can be proved in the record of a case.
And I think -- isn't it true that in this record

12

13

there is no evidence of any problem that caused the

14

adoption of the new policy?

15

MS. MAHONEY:

There is no evidence of any

16

problem, but the INS did not concede that there were no

17

problems in the districts where they released them.

18
19

QUESTION:

They just didn't prove -- they just

didn't prove that there were any.
MS. MAHONEY:

20

They did not prove that there were

21

any.

But the important point here, I think, is that if we

22

look at the Federal Register notice that accompanies the

23

adoption of this regulation, it states quite clearly what

24

the purposes of INS are.

25

of the Attorney General, are to further the overall

And those purposes, the purposes

1

welfare of these children.

2

One thing that the Ninth Circuit just

3

fundamentally did not discuss was what are - - what is the

4

condition of custody that is at issue here.

5

that what we are talking about is detention of children in

6

institutional facilities,

7

concluded that that doesn't make any sense if what you're

8

trying to do is further the children's welfare.

But that,

in fact,

It assumed

And they -- they

is not what INS does with

10

these children.

11

custody until an appropriate guardian can be found, they

12

have entered into a series of quite expensive agreements

13

with private, State-licensed child welfare organizations

14

to place the children in these homes, pending location of

15

a family member or the appointment of a guardian.

16

Instead, they -- while they retain legal

Typically,

the placement in these homes is 30

days, maybe a little bit more, a little bit less.

18

19

their freedom are truly quite minimal.

20

terms of the -- of the program as established in the

21

Federal Register, the facilities that provide this care --

22

and I would note,

23

providers are facilities that are -- have been established

24

-- group homes and foster homes established by the

25

Catholic Church.

that we're talking about here.

9

They don't have

They're -- to use the terms of the CRS

That's the nature of the restraint on liberty

Furthermore, in the Federal Register where the
INS discusses why they retained legal custody of these

10

children while they're in these homes, it's so that they

11

can pay for it.

12

restraints on these children.

13

retaining a legal obligation to care for the children

14

until the home can be found.

15

They're not imposing substantial
They're -- they're

Another important aspect of this program that

16

absolutely goes by the board under the Ninth Circuit's

17

plan is that these facilities that -- the directors of

18

these child-care facilities are actually paid to help the

19

children find family members.

20

find people that they can link up with and live with in a

21

caring and supportive environment, and typically that is

22

successful.

23

The whole objective is to

INS works with the director of the facility to

24

try and locate the parents to find out who they would

25

designate as a guardian, or to find relatives.

And that

1

is precisely how this program works, and that is -- it is

2

the very purpose and, really, far more consistent with

3

these children's interests than the plan that the Ninth

4

Circuit has.
QUESTION:

5

Now Ms. Mahoney, generally what is

6

the age of these children?

7

to 18?
MS. MAHONEY:

8

9

Does it run all the way from 0

Generally, they're -- most of them

are 16 and 17, some of them are as young as 13 and 14.

10

And there are different kinds of care facilities

11

available, particularly for the youngest children.

12

of the Catholic Church's organizations, for instance,

13

include foster-care homes where these children can be

14

placed pending the location of a family member.
QUESTION:

15

You made mention of Haiti.

Some

I don't

16

find it in your brief, but how do those Haitians get over

17

here?
MS. MAHONEY:

18

Well, a lot of them are brought

19

here or have - - had been brought here by the United

20

States,

21

many of them from Guantanamo to the United States, to

22

assert -- they paroled them into the United States.

23

The Coast Guard picked them up and have brought

And I would note, Your Honor, that many of those

24

child - - some of those unaccompanied minors are housed in

25

precisely the same location as these children who have

1

been charged with illegal presence in the United States,

2

showing that - - that these terms - - the terms of custody

3

here are really not restrictive of liberty.

4

They are designed to further the interests of

5

the children.

They offer specialized programs to help the

6

children in terms of becoming culturally acclimated into

7

our society, and --as well as -- as educational efforts

8

and medical treatment.

9

frankly I think -QUESTION:

10

A whole range of services.

Ms. Mahoney, all of the juveniles

11

which are subject to the INS program are themselves

12

thought to be subject to deport -- to be illegally

13

present.

14

But,

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

And, in fact, as

15

this Court noted in NCIR last year, aliens that are

16

brought into custody and charged with being deportable, 97

17

percent of the time they concede deportability.

18

I think it's probably more like 99 percent of the time

19

they concede that they are deportable.

20

issue, really, is whether they will be given relief from

21

deportation at the time of their hearing, which is often

22

much longer, I mean much --

23

QUESTION:

And here

And the only

If they are found nondeportable, what

24

provision is made for their custody?

25

15-year-old.

MS. MAHONEY:

1

In other words if they were

2

brought -- if they were arrested, and there was no basis

3

to hold them.

4

QUESTION:

5

nondeportable, yes.

They're arrested, they're found

MS. MAHONEY:

6

I don't know the answer to that.

7

I assume that INS would place them in one of their shelter

care facilities and look for a parent.

9

certain.
QUESTION:

10

I'm really not

But if the police authorities

11

detained, say, a 15-year-old -- he's known to be a

12

citizen, he's not an alien -- can they hold -- continue to

13

hold him if no parent or close relative appears, or is

14

there a constitutional obligation to release the

15

15-year-old?

16

MS. MAHONEY:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Not talking about aliens now.

Just -- just a citizen, a young

citizen.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well, I think that -- that the way

20

it works under the statute, anyway, is that a magistrate

21

is to find an appropriate custodian for them, including a

22

licensed -- the director of a shelter care facility, and

23

is to release the child to - -

25

This is under the Federal Youth

Corrections Act?

MS. MAHONEY:

1

Yeah, 18 U.S.C. 5034, I believe.

2

They are to release them to the director of a shelter care

3

facility, or a responsible adult.

4
5

QUESTION:

Even though no offense has been

committed.
MS. MAHONEY:

6

Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

7

offense has been committed --

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. MAHONEY:

10
11

If no

Yes.
- - I do not know what they do with

them.
QUESTION:

Would it be constitutional for the

12

Federal Government to pass a statute saying that they must

13

be detained until an adult family member or other

14

responsible adult appears to take custody of the child?

15

MS. MAHONEY:

I think it would, Your Honor.

The

16

critical inquiry in due process analysis is the legitimacy

17

of the Government's purpose.

18

the best analogy to what you're talking about would be

19

statutes dealing with runaways.

20

And certainly I think the --

Because oftentimes police, let's say, in

21

California will pick up a child who is not charged with an

22

offense, but who they discover has run away from their

23

home in, let's say, Illinois.

24

statutes that provide that the State authorities are not

25

to release the children to anyone other than a legal

And many States have

custodian or a parent.

2

them to someone else, they will prevent the family

3

reunification which is really the heart of the liberty

4

interests that children might have.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

And the reason is if they release

And this is up to the age of 18, you

think?
MS. MAHONEY:

That is up to the age of 18,

8

that's correct, Your Honor.

9

Arizona and in California they have such statutes.

10

And I know that in - - in

Under the Ninth Circuit rationale, those laws

11

really should be unconstitutional.

12

really said is that it is unconstitutional for the

13

Attorney General to prefer to place these children

14

temporarily in a licensed child-care facility pending the

15

location of a family member, instead of releasing them to

16

an unrelated adult.

17

Because what they have

And, I mean, from a parent's perspective, I

18

think that the Ninth Circuit's system is rather

19

frightening.

20

would prefer to know that their children are in the

21

custody of licensed child-care professionals than being

22

released to strangers who are not under the supervision or

23

monitoring of any State system.

24

vulnerable and in those parents' homes with no -- in those

25

adults' homes with no one to watch them.

I would certainly think that many parents

So - -

1

QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, does the record include

2

what you've just represented to us about the basic reason

3

being to - - to, in effect, preserve conditions in which

4

the reunification of the family can be fostered, as

5

opposed to conditions in which that is less likely.

6

that in the record?

7
8

MS. MAHONEY:
certainly in the record.

Is

Well, the CRS Standards are
Those are the standards, the

community relations standards, that govern the facilities.
10

And it very much says, in fact it places a contractual

11

obligation on the facility to assist the child in finding

12

an appropriate -- finding family relatives or an

13

appropriate custodian and, in fact, says that they are to

14

assist family members who need to go through the State

15

guardianship process.

16
17
18

And, yes, that is in the record.
contractual obligation.
QUESTION:

It is a

It's in our appendix.

Ms. Mahoney, if we were dealing here

1

with someone over the age of 18, and that person had been

20

arrested on a deportation warrant, found not deportable, I

21

take it, then, the INS would simply release the person?

22

MS. MAHONEY:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That's correct, Your Honor.

So the INS deals differently with --

with minors or juveniles than it does with adults.
MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct.

QUESTION:

1

Would you clarify for me something

2

that I think Justice Stevens asked you?

3

the policy of INS before 1988 to release deportable minors

4

to responsible adults other than the listed relatives?
MS. MAHONEY:

5

Your Honor, it was not a national

6

policy.

7

San Diego, for instance, did not.

8

be - -

9
10

Was it, in fact,

Some districts did and some districts did not.

QUESTION:

They insisted that it

But no articulated policy.

MS. MAHONEY:

There was not a unified policy.

11

And, frankly, there was dissatisfaction with the policy,

12

which is what led to the adoption of this overall program,

13

in order to try to, in fact, assist the minors.

14

The --

15

QUESTION:

But Ms. Mahoney -- excuse me.

16

QUESTION:

This regulation was adopted with

17

virtually no explanation in the record, as far as a normal

18

APA explanation.

19
20
21

MS. MAHONEY:

The Federal Register includes an

explanation of the reasons.
QUESTION:

Well, isn't it pretty cursory?

I

22

mean it just says no home studies; we're not equipped to

23

do it, we're not equipped to consider those matters.

24
25

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, it also says, though, that

what they're concerned about is the welfare of the

1

children and that they think it appropriate to rely upon

2

State processes.

3

about financing this issue, it's about expertise.

4

And it talks about -- it's not just

And I think it's important to note that under

5

certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act,

6

Congress has, in fact, said that it is appropriate for the

7

Attorney General to defer to State laws concerning custody

8

of children.

9

those are, because I think they strongly support the

And I'd like to, sort of, point out which

10

policy that the INS and the Attorney General have adopted

11

here.

12

First, in connection with adoption, which is set

13

forth in 8 U.S.C. 1101(b)(1)(F) and 1154(d), Congress said

14

that a foreign-born child can only be brought into the

15

United States for adoption if the Attorney General is

16

satisfied that proper care will be furnished, and that

17

finding can only be made if there is a valid home study

18

that has been favorably recommended by the State agency.

19

In other words, even with respect to immigration, the

20

State agencies' determinations are dispositive of fitness

21

to serve as a custodian.

22

And probably of more significance is the 1980

23

Refugee Act has a provision at 8 U.S.C. 1522(d) that deals

24

with the problem of what to do with the unaccompanied

25

minor refugees who are brought into the United States

QUESTION:

And really --

Ms. Mahoney, may I go back to the

history just a moment, please, because I think we're going

you promulgated the regulation.

Is there any evidence that the --

this policy had been adopted in any district before 1984?
MS. MAHONEY:

11

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, I --

Before 1984.
Before 1984 I'm not certain.

Right, but --

And is there any evidence in the

record that the old policy ever got the department in any

18

trouble or ever got any children in any trouble?

19

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, the department did not

20

put that evidence in the record, nor did they concede ever

21

that there had not been any problems.

22

QUESTION:

And didn't they have two reasons for

23

adopting the policy, and one was to protect themselves

24

from liability?

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I believe that it was.

You don't rely on that when -- that

reason anymore.
MS. MAHONEY:

No.

That may be a reason, but I

11

don't think that that is the -- what's motivating this.

12

mean INS is -- the Attorney General is spending a lot of

13

money, a lot of effort, trying to help the children.

14

I don't see why we should conclude that they're

15

constitutionally mandated to protect them less.

16

And

And even if that was once how they did it, one

17

reason they might not know about problems, Your Honor, is

18

that once they release them to an adult, they don't --

19

they don't necessarily hear from them ever again.

20

QUESTION:

No, but the thing that puzzles me

21

is -- under your description of the history it's puzzling

to me to understand why anyone would bring this lawsuit.

1

No, but why wouldn't they have

just -- why wouldn't your opponents just throw in the

3

towel and say, well, they're taking such wonderful care of

4

these children that we have no reason to litigate?

5

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I think they should

6

have.

7

when we were before the district court lawyers for the

8

department said we have adopted a new policy.

9

I think they should have, and I do not -- you know,

First of all, we've settled all of the claims

10

concerning the conditions of confinement.

We have adopted

11

the community relations standards and established a

12

network of shelter care facilities, and there is a

13

settlement agreement that is enforceable that requires us

14

to adhere to those standards.

15

related to that, this regulation which identifies who's

16

appropriate to be fit as a custodian.

And now we've adopted,

17

The district court, nevertheless, went ahead.

18

He looked at -- he got supplemental briefs on the issue

19

and found that the program was facially unconstitutional,

20

and there's never been any question that it is that

21

regulation which has been the subject -- was the subject

22

of his order and which was before the Ninth Circuit at the

23

time that they ruled.

24

They were - - I mean maybe they were influenced
by ancient history, but the fact is this is the program

that has been held invalid.

2

the Attorney General provides all of this support for the

3

children, and inside the western region the Attorney

4

General must release these children to any unrelated adult

5

absent affirmative evidence that they're going to harm the

6

child.

7

Outside the western region,

We don't like that system.

We don't think it's

8

sound, and think that it's -- it's simply not only

9

legitimate, but that this is the way to do it.

This is

10

the way to handle the problem and to serve the long-term

11

interests of these children.

12

If I could turn quickly to the procedural issue.

13

QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, may I just ask you one

14

question before you do that.

It's just sort of about the

15

present state of the record.

We're left, it seems to me,

16

as Justice Stevens has pointed out, with evidence that

17

prior to '84 a -- we'll call it a less restrictive or less

18

protective, whichever word we want to use, policy was in

19

effect.

20

There's no evidence that the Government suffered

21

liability as a result of that policy, and there's no

22

evidence that, in fact, the Government had runaways and

23

found it difficult to -- to bring their respondents to the

24

point of adjudication.

25

of policy in '84 to the more protective or restrictive.

On top of that, we have a change

1

We have no affirmative evidence supporting that.
How does that affect our right to -- to make a

2

3

determination about legitimacy for the -- for the kind of

4

threshold level substantive due process analysis?

5

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I don't think there

6

needs to be a factual record for the issue of legitimacy

7

here.

8

nothing about the features of this program that would

9

suggest an illegitimate purpose.

I think we can simply look at the program.

There's

It is cheaper, it is easier, to release the

10
11

children in the manner that the Ninth Circuit has

12

established, so what possible illegitimate purpose could

13

the INS have unless one concluded that it is not relevant

14

whether these children find a home and an appropriate,

15

suitable guardian.

16

And, certainly, the provisions of the

17

Immigration and Nationality Act suggest otherwise, that

18

Congress is very concerned with the welfare of alien

19

children while they are in the United States, as they

20

should be.

politically accountable to foreign nations for the

22

treatment of their citizens, including their minor

23

citizens, while they are here.

And

1

given that there really is not any significant restriction

2

on these children's liberty interests, it seems to me that

3

there's no real way to say that this doesn't survive

constitutional scrutiny.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARLOS HOLGUIN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14
15
16

Mr. Holguin,

MR. HOLGUIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue here, we believe, is straightforward.

17

May a law enforcement agency institutionalize children

18

throughout a lengthy deportation process solely to protect

19

that child when there is a responsible adult available to

20

care for that minor.

21

The district court held that the INS may detain

22

children, provided the agency makes an individualized

23

determination that an available adult would not be - - or

24

release to an available adult would not in a given child's

25

best interests.

QUESTION:

6

they not?

7

MR. HOLGUIN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That's true, Your Honor.

I mean it isn't -- you aren't

contending that these 13 or 15 or 16 should simply be
released on their own on the street.
MR. HOLGUIN:

11

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

In

12

fact, this case doesn't even involve those minors for whom

13

no person comes.

14

if no -- no responsible adult appears for that minor, then

15

the Immigration Service, under this order, is permitted to

16

continue detention.

If -- under this district court's order,

And you don't contest the validity of

that.

19

MR. HOLGUIN:

20

QUESTION:

No, not in this case, Your Honor.

Well, as a matter of law there's a

21

right to detain in that circumstance, is there not?

22

There's no constitutional violation.

23

MR. HOLGUIN:

In the event that the INS takes a

forward for that minor.

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. HOLGUIN:

I believe -- or the Constitution

would require some efforts on the part of the State to

QUESTION:

6

What those might be is -- is really

Well, would those efforts be

7

sufficient in the terms in which your -- Ms. Mahoney

8

described them to us, and that is that the -- that the

9

children are -- are -- are -- are retained.

The custody

10

of the children is retained, and yet the contract parties

11

who have actual custody of the children are obligated,

12

among other things, to take steps to try to link them up

13

with their natural families and ultimately to be in a

14

position to reunify the families.

15
16
17

Would that be a sufficient justification on your
theory?
MR. HOLGUIN:

If the -- if Government has

18

detained an individual and is making efforts to reduce or

19

to minimize the amount of detention that individual is

20

going to - - going to experience, then efforts toward

21

family reunification are certainly -- are certainly one

22

way of doing that.

The problem here is where we have no one coming

forward for the minor.

QUESTION:

That they're -- well, I am assuming,

there is, in fact, a bona fide object to accomplish that

result and a bona fide effort to do so.

11

MR. HOLGUIN:

Yes, yes.

12

QUESTION:

Yeah, okay.

13

QUESTION:

So is this a -- a facial challenge to

the policy?

conceded, that there is a policy established that says

they will look for a responsible family member to take the

you not?

If that's so, if what you've just said is

MR. HOLGUIN:

I -- no, Your Honor.

What we have

20

is a situation where there is somebody available to care

possibilities of family reunification here.

2

blanket rule that's applied and says that unless one of

3

these people who appears on the blood relative list

4

appears in front of us, then we're not going to release.

5

It's simply a

We say in our - - in our - - in our papers and in

6

our plan that we're going to make efforts to find -- to

7

find family members, but there's no provision as to what

8

happens when those efforts appear to be futile.

9

And the record is quite clear.

This is the

10

furthest thing from a facial challenge.

We have an

11

extensive record here showing that minors, children were

12

being held for extraordinarily long periods, despite these

13

efforts that the Immigration Service has only recently

14

inaugurated, ostensibly, to find family members and so

15

forth, without there ever being an end to detention or any

16

kind of an individualized determination, no matter how

17

remote the possibility of finding any kind of a relative

18

is.

19

And that's the entire thrust of this case.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. HOLGUIN:

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Holguin.
Yes.

Does your position not require you to

23

maintain that the Federal statute governing detention of

24

aliens suspected of illegal immigration is

25

unconstitutional?

SUITE 400

Because as I understand the statute, in

1

2

principle all aliens suspected of illegal immigration may­

3

be detained in custody, adults and children alike.

4

up to the discretion of the Attorney General to release

5

them, if he wishes.

Nov; is that unconstitutional?

MR. HOLGUIN:

6

It's

Your Honor, just last term this

7

Court held in National Center for Immigrants Rights,

8

Incorporated, versus the INS, that under that statute

9

there needs to be an individualized determination as to

10

cause for detain.
QUESTION:

11

Now once that happens -Where -- as to cause, meaning as to

12

whether the person is an illegal immigrant or not, or is

13

likely to be an illegal immigrant.

14

let them out to enjoy the United States for 2 years before

15

you can finally deport them.

16

MR. HOLGUIN:

17

QUESTION:

But you don't have to

Well --

You could -- you could hold them in

18

custody, could you not, all of them, adults and children

19

alike?
MR. HOLGUIN:

20

You can maintain them in custody

21

under the precedent that I've just cited only if there is

22

an individualized determination, that there used to be

done.

1

MR. HOLGUIN:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

In that

2

case it was an individualized determination of right to

3

work or not.

4

So I think that the initial - - the initial

5

decision to detain here is not at issue.

6

decision where the INS has said we're going to take you

7

into custody is not the issue.

9

QUESTION:

The initial

You will have won a pretty small

victory if the only -- if the only minors that your-- that

10

your victory applies to are those who are not reasonably

11

suspected of being illegal immigrants, because I don't --

12

I don't suppose that that's a very large percentage of the

13

total at issue.

14

MR. HOLGUIN:

The Immigration Service's

15

rationale for adopting this policy has nothing to do with

16

whether a minor is going to appear for a deportation

17

hearing or not, whether they're going to be available for

18

deportation.

19

turns on one item, and that is whether or not detention is

20

going to be in the best interests of minors as a general

21

proposition.

The entire justification for this policy

Well, if -- if -- if it's determined

that there's -- individually determined that there's

pending the final determination.

2

MR. HOLGUIN:

3

Are you referring to the statute

itself?

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. HOLGUIN:

Yes, and the Constitution.
Under the Constitution the INS

would have to show a -- that its grounds for detaining are

7

weighty enough to justify that kind of infringement on

8

personal liberty.

That showing --

So you don't concede that the INS

could detain adults?

11

MR. HOLGUIN:

QUESTION:

Detain every -- no.

Its grounds for detaining are that

13

this person does not belong in the United States.

14

have -- we have good reason to believe that this person

15

should be deported, and we're darned if we think that the

16

person should enjoy the United States for as long as it

17

takes to get the person deported.

MR. HOLGUIN:

19

QUESTION:

21

And we

Well.

We're talking aliens, now, we're not

talking about United States citizens.
MR. HOLGUIN:

We may be.

The point of the

22

matter is, is that when counsel refers to the vast

23

majority of people who are apprehended by the Immigration

24

we're talking about in this case.
Those individuals sign what's called a voluntary-

2

3

departure form and are - - and are sent on the next

4

available transportation outside of the country.

5

those minors who say wait a minute, I have a reason to

contest my deportability, are the ones that find

7

themselves in the deportation hearings and in the long­

8

term type of institutionalization that we're dealing with

9

in this case.

Only

So the vast majority of those whom you correctly

10
11

point out are here illegally have gone and never find

12

themselves members of this particular class of children.

13

It's only those who have said wait a minute, I have a

14

reason to contest my deportability, I have a defense of

15

deportation, I want a deportation hearing -- and those are

the ones that we're placing into this long-term detentive

Suppose that a State in its child welfare program

MR. HOLGUIN:

What is the standard?
The proper standard is whether the

INS is able to show a good and sufficient reason in the

that.

If

10

the INS has any real reason to detain, it's entitled to

11

detain under this district court order.

12

Do

It's only where there is no real reason to

13

detain and the INS has simply said, you, you, and you,

14

we're going to presume that you're going to be a fine

custodian, and everyone else is somehow excluded no matter

16

how reputable, no matter how much the INS officer, in

fact, wants to release this minor to this individual,

18

where it simply cannot be done.

It's that blanket, automatic detention that

offends the Constitution here.

Again, we're talking about a -- a

I thought you were, then.

MS. MAHONEY:

in -- in -- the idea is to leave discretion for those

rather exceptional and unusual circumstances.

7

For instance, if the godfather has, in fact,

8

lived and cared for this child and they have the kind of

family relationship that INS is, in fact, trying to

10

promote and makes representations that they're in the

would be the type of - - of circumstance that might warrant

the child will remain in a group home run by the Catholic
Church or another private organization.
