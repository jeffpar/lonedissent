ORAL ARGUMENT OF MAUREEN E. MAHONEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

12

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns the scope of the President's

13

emergency powers to adopt measures that he deems to be

14

necessary to prevent a mass migration of aliens across the

15

high seas and to the ability of the alien migrants to

16

challenge those measures in United States courts.

17

Last May, in the first 20 days, more than 10,000

18

Haitians crowded into unseaworthy vessels and set sail for

19

our shores.

20

stop this migration while continuing to offer the migrants

21

any kind of asylum screening on board Coast Guard cutters

22

or at off-shore locations such as Guantanamo.

23

The President determined that he could not

He accordingly concluded that a change in the

24

procedures was required in order to stop the migration and

25

to save lives that he concluded would be lost if that

1

number of people continued to flow out of Haiti in the

2

vessels which are clearly unseaworthy.
He accordingly invoked his powers under the

3
4

Immigration & Nationality Act, which are in the nature of

5

emergency powers, to adopt the procedure that he thought

6

were necessary, and those procedures provided that the

7

Coast Guard should directly repatriate Haitians without

8

asylum screening but that persons who genuinely feared

9

persecution should be given an opportunity to seek

10

admission as a refugee through asylum processing at the

11

embassy.
QUESTION:

12

Ms. Mahoney, was this directive aimed

13

at any Haitians who were leaving Haiti, or just Haitians

14

who were leaving Haiti for the United States?

15

MS. MAHONEY:

It's directed at Haitians who were

16

leaving for the United States.

17

directs the Coast Guard to determine whether they have

18

reason to believe that undocumented aliens are seeking

19

entry into United States territorial waters, and the Coast

20

Guard has enforced it in that way.
QUESTION:

21

The executive order

Once the procedures were changed, the

22

exodus that had begun a number of months before was

23

halted.

24
25

They were effective.
The problem that we face now is that the threat

of the out-migration continues because the underlying

conditions in Haiti that have caused people to wish to
leave their country --a variety of political and economic
conditions -- continue to persist.
The President has accordingly determined that in
order to prevent mass migration, just as last May, and
also to prevent loss of life at sea, perhaps hundreds or
thousands, the policy of direct repatriation must
continue, but the President has also directed that efforts
be made to fully fund the asylum processing in Haiti so
that those who wish to come to the United States because
they genuinely fear persecution will have an opportunity
to adjudicate those claims expeditiously in Haiti and flee
Haiti through those orderly procedures.
QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, you don't claim that

section 1253(h) is unconstitutional, I take it?
MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, we're not claiming

that it's unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

Has any effort been made to amend the

statute?
MS. MAHONEY:
QUESTION:

Since this occurred?

Yes.

MS. MAHONEY:

Not that I know of.

I don't

believe that -- a bill might have been introduced, I
really can't say, but nothing has certainly gotten very
far.

1

The Coast Guard is accordingly still under

2

orders from the President to interdict Haitians and to

3

repatriate them without conducting asylum screening.

4

court of appeals, nevertheless, told -- directed the

5

commandant of the Coast Guard to disregard the procedures

6

that had been established by the President and to resort

7

to the procedures that had been suspended by the President

8

last year in the national interest.

9

The

We respectfully ask this Court to reverse the

10

order of the court of appeals and to permit the 20

11

military vessels that are currently stationed off the

12

coast of Haiti to operate under the direction of the Coast

3
4

Guard and the President and not the Federal courts.
QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, after the court of

5

appeal's ruling last spring, was an injunction actually

6

entered by the district court?

7
8
9

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, it was, Your Honor, but this

Court stayed it.
QUESTION:

And was -- did the injunction -- was

20

it directed against the Commandant of the Coast Guard and

21

the Commandant of the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, too?

22

MS. MAHONEY:

Yes, I believe that it was

23

directed against all of the defendants, and definitely

24

against the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

25

QUESTION:

What did it command them to do?

^

1

MS. MAHONEY:

It commanded them not to return

2

any interdicted Haitian who would be threatened with

3

persecution in Haiti, and necessarily, in order to comply

4

with that order, Your Honor, we would have to conduct some

5

sort of asylum screening so that we could be in compliance

6

with the injunction, otherwise we wouldn't know whether we

7

were returning someone who might fear persecution.

8
9

QUESTION:

Is the asylum screening, Ms. Mahoney,

that's taking place in Haiti pursuant to the Government's

10

obligations under section 1253?

11

MS. MAHONEY:

No, it is not, Your Honor.

12

Government does not have obligations under 1253(h) outside

13

of the territory of the United States.

14

QUESTION:

15

on the part of the Government.

16

So this is just a gratuitous effort

MS. MAHONEY:

Well, it is a humanitarian effort

17

on the part of the Government to provide an orderly way

18

for persons with genuine fears of persecution in Haiti to

19

seek asylum and come to the United States.

20

The situation that he had before, when we were

21

conducting screening on Coast Guard cutters and at

22

Guantanamo, was conducting thousands and thousands of

23

people to essentially risk their lives so that they could

24

get the opportunity to apply for asylum outside of their

25

own country and the chance to come to the United States,

1

even though the vast majority of those people will not

2

ultimately be found to be eligible for asylum.

3

This unnecessarily creates the risk of loss of

4

life at sea, and it interferes with our foreign policy

5

initiatives, which very fundamentally depend upon bringing

6

order and stability into that country.

7

QUESTION:

If a person in Haiti is found

8

eligible for asylum, what steps are taken to allow him to

9

enter the United States?

10

MS. MAHONEY:

They are transported to the United

11

States, and hundreds of people have in fact been brought

12

to the United States pursuant to that procedure, which

13

again is being expanded by the President, and emergency

14

refugee funding was just devoted to that.

15

We are not under an obligation to provide that

16

process, but it is part of the procedures that the

17

President had determined constitute an appropriate

18

response to the emergency situation in Haiti. In this way,

19

the asylum claims can be made in an orderly way.

20

They can be adjudicated more effectively because

21

persons at the embassy and asylum employees who are

22

adjudicating the claims can look into the allegations.

23

Trying to conduct asylum interviews on Coast Guard cutters

24

at Guantanamo did not produce results that really very

25

accurately reflect the true nature of the claims.

QUESTION:

1

What is the authority of the United

2

States to conduct such extrastatutory - - take such

3

extrastatutory steps?

4

MS. MAHONEY:

Oh, those are not extrastatutory.

5

That is a procedure that Congress adopted in section

6

It's a procedure for refugee admissions for aliens who are

7

outside the United States.

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. MAHONEY:

In fact --

All right.
The system that Congress set up

10

really reflects the differences in the obli -- in the

11

benefits that are to be afforded to aliens outside the

12

United States and aliens who have reached our shores.

3

57.

Congress provided that you could apply for

4

asylum in the United States and it could be granted in the

5

discretion of the Attorney General if you've reached our

16

borders.

Outside the United States, you could only apply

7

for asylum if the President determined in consultation

8

with the Congress that a nation represented a

9

particular -- an area of humanitarian concern.

20

And Haiti is one of the very few nations in the

21

world where we have actually established in-country

22

asylum-processing centers -- I believe there are only five

23

or six -- and this was done, again, to try to facilitate

24

the adjudication of those claims and to stop this exodus

25

which is threatening our foreign policy interests and

1

humanitarian interests as well.

2

I'd like to emphasize that we do not --

3

QUESTION:

None of this has anything to do with

4

the legal issue in front of us,

5

position you've taken is that you have no obligation to

6

permit aliens to come to the United States in order that

7

they may apply for asylum here.

8

MS. MAHONEY:

9

QUESTION:

10

3

I believe.

The

That is correct, Your Honor.

I --

So maybe we can talk about that legal

issue.

11
12

though,

MS. MAHONEY:

The -- the point here, Your Honor,

is that the power that the President has under
85(a)( )

82 (f)

and

is to adopt procedures -- these are in the

4

nature of emergency powers, and they are to adopt

5

procedures in response to crises abroad or international

16

situations which he thinks to be appropriate in the

7

national interest, and it is these combination of

8

procedures, direct return plus the availability of the 207

9

screening, that makes for both a humanitarian policy and

20
21

one that is certainly well within his legal authority.
The scope of the powers that were conferred by

22

Congress were addressed by this Court in Knauff v.

23

Shaughnessy in

24

and there the Court emphasized that these powers were very

25

broad, were in the nature of emergency powers, and in fact

950 before the '52 amendments to the INA,

10

1

so broad that the President could in fact suspend

2

exclusion hearings when he deemed it to be appropriate,

3

even for aliens who had reached our borders.
In that case, the bride -- alien bride of an

4
5

American soldier was not allowed entry and was not given a

6

hearing because the President had delegated unreviewable

1

discretion to the Attorney General to deny such procedures

when he thought it appropriate in the national interest,

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, who directs the Coast

io

Guard under the current policy?

ii

MS. MAHONEY:

The Department of Transportation,

12

the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

13

has not issued any directives to the Coast Guard, Your

14

Honor.

:

15

QUESTION:

The Attorney General

Does the Attorney General ordinarily

16

have jurisdiction over the conduct of the United States on

17

the high seas?

18
19
20

MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, the Attorney

General does not.
Under 8 U.S.C. section 1357 his responsibilities

21

are to enforce the immigration laws within the borders of

22

the United States and within the territorial waters, so

23

this further underscores that if Congress intended to

24

limit the scope of the President's emergency powers under

25

1182(f) and 1185(a)(1), surely they would not have simply

1

written 1253(h) as a direction to the Attorney General and

2

included it in parts 4 and 5, which deal with exclusion

3

and deportation proceedings.
QUESTION:

4

These are --

Ms. Mahoney, may I just interrupt you

5

on one point before you get too far from it?

Isn't there

6

a law to the effect that the Coast Guard is deemed legally

7

to be executing the policies of whatever department it may

8

be responsive to so that if the Coast Guard is

9

implementing a policy which is set by the Attorney General

10

it would be treated as the Attorney General for statutory

11

purposes?
MS. MAHONEY:

12

Your Honor, you're referring, I

13

believe, to 14 U.S.C. section 89, and it does provide that

14

when the Coast Guard is acting under the -- basically as

15

the agent of a particular department, that it will use its

16

procedures, but here it is clear that the Coast Guard is

17

acting at the direction of the President under the

18

President's powers under 1182(f) and 1185(a)(1), and that

19

is a very different source of power than that which is

20

conferred on the Attorney General to enforce our

21

immigration laws within the boundaries of the United

22

States.

23

The Attorney General is responsible for making

24

refugee determinations in the course of exclusion and

25

deportation proceedings, and I would note that 1253(h),
12

1

the express language is directed to the Attorney General,

2

and if the Attorney General makes a determination that a

3

person would be subject to persecution, then they shall

4

not be deported or returned.
That language simply has no bearing on the

5
6

President's exercise of his powers, separate powers under

7

1182(f) .
QUESTION:

8

9
10
11

So basically your argument is that

1253(f) is really irrelevant to the issue that we've got
here.
MS. MAHONEY:

No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say

12

that it's irrelevant.

13

issue that the court of appeals looked at and said it was

14

not extraterritorial, which we agree with, but this simply

15

shows that, given that the President was exercising

16

authority under different sections, if Congress had

17

intended to circumscribe those powers, it would not have

18

written 1253(h) in the way that it did.

19

addressed to the Attorney General and his exercise of

20

powers, and this is particularly so, given that the --

21

given the broad interpretation of 1185(a)(1) that had

22

already been adopted in Knauff v. Shaughnessy when

23

Congress --

24
25

QUESTION:

I -- I mean, certainly, it's the

It clearly is

Isn't it true that both 1182(f) and

1185 deal with the power of the President to prevent entry

1

into the United States, rather than to return to any

2

particular destination?

3

I think.

4

MS. MAHONEY:

It addresses a different problem,

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

5

think that those powers are very broad, they're designed

6

to give the -- the President the authority to -- it says

7

to control the travel of aliens and prevent -- not

8

prevent, excuse me, and to prohibit attempts to enter.

9

QUESTION:

That's right.

10

MS. MAHONEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. MAHONEY:

3

It talks about entry.

Right.

To suspend entry.
To -- to suspend entry, but

85(a)( ) specifically talks about prohibiting travel,

4

and by adopting rules and regulations that he deems

5

appropriate.

6
7

I

QUESTION:

Well, it deals with aliens who are to

depart or enter, or attempt to enter or depart.

8

MS. MAHONEY:

9

Essentially, the proclamation in

Attempt to enter, Your Honor.
98

said that the

20

attempt to enter the territorial waters of the United

2

States on the high seas by undocumented aliens was

22

prohibited.

23

here is enforcing and asking the Coast Guard to enforce

24

that limitation that was established by proclamation for

25

the purposes of protecting the sovereignty of the United

So essentially what the President is doing

1

States.

2

QUESTION:

Not, but if there were another

3

statute that said you shall never send anybody to Cuba,

4

for example in so many words, that wouldn't -- this

5

statute would be - - the statute on the books would still

6

leave the President full of power to control entry and

7

departures from the United States.

8

would then place a limit on where he could return someone.

9

He couldn't send them to Cuba, and that's what they argue

10

11

here.

Because the statute

I don't know if they're right or not.
MS. MAHONEY:

Well -- well,

that could be,

12

except that in this case these facts demonstrate that that

13

would make the powers that have been conferred on the

14

President ineffective under these circumstances.

15

President has determined that he cannot do any sort of

16

refugee screening or take them anywhere else.

17

cannot enforce the interdiction program if he is

18

prohibited from taking them back to Haiti.

QUESTION:

MS. MAHONEY:

Right.
So,

in other words,

would be difficult to believe that Congress intended to

skirt -- circumscribe the President's authority in a way

that he has to permit a mass migration across the seas to

1

Well -- well maybe it's impractical

2

and unrealistic, but at least theoretically consistently

3

with the law, he could interdict them and send them

But if you just look at the words,

it's consistent with the various -MS. MAHONEY:

He can't enforce the prohibition

directed to the attorney general.

QUESTION:

The attorney general, I understand.

20

MS. MAHONEY:

I'd also like to turn to the fact

21

that the court of appeals didn't address the threshold

action for aliens outside of the United States to

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, if self - executing were

meant to create a cause of action, an actual cause of

3

action on behalf of that alien, I suppose that's true.

4

But I don't think that -- certainly there's nothing in the

text of article 33 or in the convention as a whole that

6

indicates that it itself creates causes of action that can

I don't know the answer to that,

recently, the Court did note that even though there were

rather explicit obligations to pay compensation, it did

not create a cause of action that was enforceable in

2

That's because Congress has determined that the only way

3

to bring that challenge is to get a certificate from the

4

consular office in the foreign locality that you,

5

basically, have probable cause to present a claim of

6

citizenship, in which case they will permit you to come to

7

the United States to make that challenge, but you cannot

8

do it from outside the United States.

9

QUESTION:

Ms. Mahoney, does -- does that mean

10

that if, say, a Haitian appears at the American consulate

11

in Port-au-Prince and makes a case for political asylum

12

and the consul simply misunderstands the law and says

13

there is no case, does that person then have no remedy in

14

the United States courts unless - -

15

MS. MAHONEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

In

16

fact, there's absolutely nothing in the statute that would

17

provide any rights of review for persons who think that

18

they have been unfairly denied, whether it be refugee

19

admission or any of the other preferences that are

20

established by the immigration laws.

21

And in the - - in one APA action that this Court

22

decided, Brownell v. Tom We Shung, the Court found that

23

the APA could be used for an alien child who came to the

24

borders of the United States and claimed a right to enter

25

under the War Brides Act, but it noted in -- in the course

1

of reaching that conclusion that, of course, aliens

2

outside the United States who have never reached our

3

borders couldn't possibly maintain a claim under the APA.

4

But even the result that this Court reached in

5

Brownell was overruled by Congress.

6

history indicated it was a fallacious doctrine to suggest

7

that aliens outside the United States could come into U.S.

8

courts under the APA.

the United States, those who have no connection to our

20

any rights of access to the courts.
And to construe the APA to nevertheless provide

21

them access with the courts when it historically has never

22

been done, seems to me to be a grave departure from our

23

law, particularly in the circumstances of this case where

24

it's aliens outside the United States who are threatening

25

to migrate en masse and, in fact, were migrating en masse,

and they wish to come into the courts of the United States

2

to challenge the action of the President in responding to

3

that.

4

It seems to me that even if the Court were to

5

think that an APA action might be appropriate, equitable

6

relief under these circumstances certainly is not.

7

President has determined that the national interest here

8

is to pursue the procedures which he has established, and

9

to suggest that the persons who wish to avoid the 207

The

10

processing in Haiti so that they can seek more beneficial

11

asylum procedures or what they might view to be more

12

beneficial asylum procedures in the United States, does

3

not strike us as equitable relief.

4

As this Court noted in Webster v. Doe, the

5

Court, when exercising powers under the APA, must

6

determine whether the relief requested is appropriate

7

equitable relief, and continues to have authority to

8

dismiss relief, whether declaratory or injunctive, that

9

does not represent an appropriate exercise of judicial

20
21

power.
This is certainly such a case, where the

22

President has determined that to adopt the procedures that

23

the court of appeals has required will result in mass

24

migration and the loss of hundreds and possibly thousands

25

of lives at sea.

Does 1253(h) rest on the assumption

MS. MAHONEY:

9

No, Your Honor, I think that

1253(h) is addressed only to the attorney general because

11

it is only addressed to the removal of aliens within our

1

that the executive power over the subject matter would be

2

exercised only through the attorney general?
MS. MAHONEY:

3

If I understand your question,

4

Your Honor, you're saying that we should conclude that the

5

President's authority was circumscribed or that he did not

6

have authority to do this.

7

QUESTION:

That -- that it was circumscribed and

8

it's a circumscription which, at least as a Constitutional

9

matter, is not presently before us.
MS. MAHONEY:

10

No, Your Honor, I don't think we

11

could construe it to circumscribe the President's

12

authority in that -- in that light, especially since in

13

Knauff v. Shaughnessy itself, the President suspended

14

exclusion hearings which were required by statute for an

15

alien bride who was entitled to admission so that she

16

could be with her husband, if she was otherwise

17

admissable.

18

So to say that -- that the -- the President's

19

powers could suspend those kinds of procedures in Knauff

20

but nevertheless not permit the President to adopt

21

procedures that are necessary to protect our sovereignty

You've heard the Government's case.

But,

unfortunately, that case differs from the one that's

It is the act of taking them into their custody

outside the United States that brings them within the

control of the attorney general, and it is that act which

then, authorizing them to be returned, makes the Coast

15

Guard an agent of the attorney general for the returned.

they have been referring, when they withdrew the words

20

they intended merely to reach deportables and excludables,

they could have said shall not return any alien physically

3

In other words, there was no need for Congress

4

to delete the words "within the United States" altogether.

5

And there is no valid claim that what was actually going

6

on here is that they -- the pen slipped, because at the

there should be no doubt as to what's going on here

because the executive order that's being invoked says,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

4

MS. MAHONEY:

There's a basic principle in our

5

law that is reflected in Johnson v. Eisentrager, it's

6

reflected in the INA, it's reflected in the construction

7

of 243(h) that governed here for 30 years, that ordinarily

8

an alien's right to protection from a country only arises

9

when they arrive in the territory of the United States.

0

It is not at all unusual that aliens outside the United

11

States should not have rights under U.S. law or access to

12

its courts.

3

I'd like to emphasize that the removal of the

4

language "within the United States" is a direct response

5

to this Court's holding in Leng Ma May Ma v. Barber, that

6

that language meant it could not apply in exclusion

7

proceedings.

QUESTION:

Then -- then why didn't it say so?

I

mean why didn't it simply refer to exclusion rather than
return?
MS. MAHONEY:

The word return, as Judge Walker

22

notes in his dissent, had been used as a reference in

23

statutes before to the manner in which you exclude people

24

from the United States.

25

exclude to a country where they would be threatened with

If the statute had read deport or

persecution, it wouldn't make any sense.

2

So in order to respond to the concern that - -

3

that the INS had that they'd like to go ahead and extend

4

it to exclusion proceedings, they need to add -- take out

5

"within the United States" and add another word.

6

done voluntarily by the INS when the '80 act was being

7

amended.

This was

8

In fact, Stevie and Cardoza-Fonseca say that it

9

is important to look at how the act was being interpreted

10

in the 12-year period after accession to the protocol and

11

prior to the amendment, because we should conclude that

12

what we were doing during that 12-year period was

13

consistent with the protocol.

14

And contrary to what Mr. Koh has said, the INS

15

in fact, and the BIA took the position repeatedly that

16

243(h) had not been extended to exclusion proceedings.

17

Matter of Pierre that was settled by the BIA, it still

18

during that period applied only to persons who were within

19

the United States, but we believed that we were in

20

compliance with the protocol and, in fact, we were.
