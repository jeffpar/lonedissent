ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. McCARTNEY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. McCARTNEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This action involves the boundary between the

11
12

states of Mississippi, Louisiana, and the private

13

ownership of a body of land known as Stack Island or

14

Island No. 94, patented by the United States as

15

Mississippi land in 1881.

16

location of this island, which is the only island at issue

17

in this case, can be traced from ancient maps beginning in

18

1826 through aerial photographs beginning in 1932 through

time.

Mississippi, that the thalweg, that's corrupted in

2

Louisiana and Mississippi to thalweg, of the Mississippi

3

River forms the boundary between the states, and that

4

boundary shifts with gradual shifts in the location.

5

QUESTION:

If that's so, why is it that 1881

6

became the relevant date for the district court's inquiry?

7

Why shouldn't it have been where the thalweg was at the

8

time when the state was admitted to the Union?

9

MR. McCARTNEY:

1881 became the focal point of

10

the controversy, Your Honor.

11

evidence with respect to the documentary evidence showing

12

the island as early as 1826.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. McCARTNEY:

15

Well, was it -So that's why it became the

center of the trial court's fact findings.

16
17

There was no controverting

QUESTION:

Was it - - and you contend that that's

the correct date to focus upon?

18

MR. McCARTNEY:

No, the correct date according

19

to the rules of this Court would be the date the existence

20

of the island if it were present at the date the state was

21

admitted to the Union or at the date it was formed.
QUESTION:

22

25

Is that what you argued in the trial

court?
MR. McCARTNEY:

Yes.

Your Honor, in the trial

court we offered all of this evidence and suggested -4

1

QUESTION:

I know you offered it all, but was

2

your theory in the trial court that the date of admission

3

to the Union was the critical date, and that you tried to

4

find out from the best evidence available what the

5

situation was at that point?

6

MR. McCARTNEY:

The theory in the trial court

7

focused on the 1881 because of the controversy, but the

8

evidence in the trial court and the finding of the trial

9

court, the ultimate finding is susceptible of the

10

interpretation that the applicable state entry date can be

11

under the evidence of this case the controlling date.

12

no, the principal focus of the argument in the trial court

13

was the controversy in 1881 forward.

14

But

Now, the second point relating to the boundary

15

issue is the doctrine of acquiescence, also a factÂ­

16

intensive doctrine.

17

of the conflicting evidence of the experts that the

18

thalweg lay on the west side of the island, and thus under

19

the thalweg rule the island was Mississippi property.

20

trial court also found based on extensive evidence that if

21

the trial court were wrong in that finding that

22

nevertheless the land were Mississippi land because of the

23

doctrine of acquiescence.

24

assertion of dominion, control, and jurisdiction.

25

The trial court found after a review

The

That is of course long

So we had two basic ultimate fact findings.

We

1

had innumerable subsidiary fact findings.

2

one of the two central points in this case, and that is

3

the Fifth Circuit's exceeding the constraints of Rule 52

4

and according deference to the trial court's findings of

5

fact.

QUESTION:

We then come to

Mr. McCartney, would you clarify a

7

couple of things for me with respect to what the Fifth

8

Circuit did?

9

One, who owned the particular land, was it the Houston

I guess there were two basic questions.

Group or the State of Louisiana?

11

MR. McCARTNEY:

12

QUESTION:

13

Correct.

The second question is was the land

at issue located in Mississippi or Louisiana, right?

14

MR. McCARTNEY:

15

QUESTION:

Right.

Now, did the Fifth Circuit, do you

16

think, did its judgment have any effect on the ownership

17

dispute as opposed to the state boundary question?

18

MR. McCARTNEY:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. McCARTNEY:

Yes, it did, Your Honor.

You think it did?
Yes.

The land was patented as

21

Mississippi land and the Fifth Circuit, the finding of the

22

trial court was that it was, the private ownership was in

23

the Houston Group.

24

by the Fifth Circuit.

25

QUESTION:

That finding was reversed and rendered

1

Houston Group or Mississippi?

2

MR. McCARTNEY:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. McCARTNEY:

Both, Your Honor.

Both.
Yes.

My counsel advises under

5

Louisiana law if it's Louisiana land it's owned by the

6

state.

7

But the focus of the first of these issues is

8

then the clearly erroneous rule or standard under Rule 52

9

which this Court has given more precision in Anderson v.

10

Bessemer City and in Amadeo v. Zant, and has very clearly

11

let it be known that if there are two permissible views of

12

the evidence that there can virtually never be a clearly

13

erroneous finding by the trial court, and that --

14

QUESTION:

Mr. McCartney, do you think that rule

15

necessarily applies in the case in which at least some

16

people might have thought belonged in this Court in the

17

first place?

18

controversies between two states.

19

MR. McCARTNEY:

20

QUESTION:

You know, we have original jurisdiction of

Yes .

Do you suppose we might have a little

21

broader authority to review the fact finding that

22

underlies the decision of such a controversy?

23

MR. McCARTNEY:

Unquestionably, Your Honor.

24

would be a different standard.

25

QUESTION:

So that we may not be bound by the

It

clearly erroneous standard.

2

MR. McCARTNEY:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. McCARTNEY:

I would not agree with that.

You think we are bound by it?
I would say that as the case

5

comes up through the appellate court route that the

6

appellate courts are bound by the erroneous standard.

7

the case comes to the Supreme Court by the original

8

jurisdiction route, then this Court has no constraints but

9

it is likewise obligated to make the fact findings

10

required as a matter of its original jurisdiction.

11

see a distinction between the standards of review under

12

the clearly erroneous finding.

QUESTION:

MR. McCARTNEY:

QUESTION:

through original jurisdiction -MR. McCARTNEY:

21

Yes.

But this one has gotten here not

So I

Depending upon how it gets here, you

Correct.

-- and so you say we would be bound

by what the district court found?
MR. McCARTNEY:

Correct.

If that you find from

22

a review, of course, that the finding was, quote,

23

plausible or was, quote, permissible.

24

And just, if I may briefly address the Court's

25

attention to some of the evidence that clearly indicates

1

that the trial court's findings were supported.
QUESTION:

2

Before you do that, would you clarify

3

for us what if we think that only this Court can determine

4

the boundary dispute, this Court and no other, that the

5

district court could not decide that question, what do we

6

do now?

7

MR. McCARTNEY:

8

that you can do one of two things.

9

which there is no forum.

If you do that, then we think
You can dismiss, in

Of course this Court has already

10

considered that problem and made a contrary determination.

11

But alternately you could consider the findings of the

12

trial court based on the record and treat them as the

13

findings of a master that you might have appointed.

14

QUESTION:

But there is no third alternative of

15

vacating any decision on the boundary but then dealing

16

separately with the question of who owns the land?

17

MR. McCARTNEY:

I think not, Your Honor.

Our

18

position is that when the case comes up through the

19

appellate route, and that's the way this Court has mapped

20

the route of this case, then we look at it on a standard

21

of review based on clearly erroneous, and if the case

22

comes up through the original jurisdiction route you

23

consider those facts yourself as a matter of original

24

jurisdiction.

1

question, I don't know if Justice O'Connor had this in

2

mind but just a slightly different version of her

3

question.

4

is not dependent on the ruling on where the boundary is?

5
6

7

Is it conceivable that the ruling on ownership

MR. McCARTNEY:

It is conceivable -- in this

case, Your Honor?
QUESTION:

Yes.

Obviously it's conceivable, but

8

in this case do both parties feel that one cannot answer

9

the ownership question without first answering the

10

boundary line question?

11

MR. McCARTNEY:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. McCARTNEY:

I believe that to be true --

I see.
-- because of the ownership of

14

the state unless, unless there is an adverse possession

15

possibility, and I am not certain whether the land has

16

been sufficiently divested from ownership by the state to

17

permit the adverse possession of the Houston Group to

18

mature title, even if this is Louisiana land.

19

QUESTION:

I see.

20

QUESTION:

So that you would fear, I guess, the

21

precedential or the res judicata effect if we allowed the

22

private ownership determination to stand and vacated with

23

respect to the sovereignty issue between the two states?

24
25

MR. McCARTNEY:

No, Your Honor, if the private

ownership were allowed to stand on the basis of the

1

adverse possession concept, then that would be the ruling

2

of this Court.

3

But --

QUESTION:

And what would be your position if we

4

vacated and allowed an original action as between the two

5

states on their controversy?
MR. McCARTNEY:

6

Your Honor, our position would

7

be that the original action would directly affect the

8

ownership if you were to at this point in time --

QUESTION:

So the original action would not,

would not be subject to res judicata is what you're

saying?

Mr. McCartney.

Why don't you answer that at 1:00,

(12:58 p.m.)

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. McCartney, you've

4

had the lunch hour to think about Justice Souter's

5

question.

QUESTION:

6

7

What was the question?

Would you

repeat the question?
MR. McCARTNEY:

8

9

Let's proceed.

As we understood the question it

was basically whether title and boundary were intertwined,

10

and we believe that they are, that if this Court were to

11

decide boundary in Louisiana that that would directly

12

affect title, although there is some --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. McCARTNEY:

Why?
Well, because, Your Honor, I was

15

going to say there is some uncertainty because of the

16

Louisiana ownership of the islands as opposed to the fact

17

that the private owners Houston have title from the United

18

States, a patent from the United States.

19

tried and it appears to us that title and boundary fall

20

together.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. McCARTNEY:

But the case was

Well, you still haven't told me why.
The best answer I can give you

23

is that if the land is in Louisiana then we have no title

24

out of Louisiana, and we may have a possessory right if

25

the Court were to find some facts -12

QUESTION:

1

2

What do you mean you don't have any

title out of Louisiana?

3

MR. McCARTNEY:

Precisely that, Your Honor.

4

title is out of the United States covering Mississippi

5

land.
QUESTION:

6

Well, what difference would it make

7

if it's in Louisiana?

8

title from the United States?

How would that cancel out your

MR. McCARTNEY:

9

Well, that, Your Honor, is why I

10

qualify to say it's not altogether clear, and that's

11

what's not clear.
QUESTION:

12

13

The

Well, what's the argument that your

title would be affected if it's in Louisiana?

14

MR. McCARTNEY:

Because we could not mature a

15

limitation title against a sovereign Louisiana by

16

possession and occupancy, and we would not have record

17

title.

18

QUESTION:

Oh, you mean adverse --

19

QUESTION:

Adverse possession.

20

MR. McCARTNEY:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

But does Louisiana recognize the

22

doctrine of accretion and avulsion that, you know, title

23

may change depending upon whether a switch in a river

24

thalweg was sudden or gradual?

25

MR. McCARTNEY:

Louisiana recognizes title by

1

accretion to private land owners and there would be a fact

2

question about the private land ownership.

3

QUESTION:

I suppose if we said that the title

4

issue should have been that we have exclusive jurisdiction

5

to decide the boundary issue, then we could, couldn't we,

6

if we decided it that way couldn't we remand to the courts

7

below to decide whether or not the fact that we took the

8

boundary issue here could be, can be disassociated with

9

the title issue?

10

MR. McCARTNEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

Yes, you could do that.

Because I would think that the courts

below could, would know more about that than we do.

13

MR. McCARTNEY:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

Mr. McCartney, I thought it was your,

15

frankly I'm surprised to hear what you've said.

16

it was your position, I gathered from footnote 14 of your

17

brief that Mississippi would remain free to litigate the

18

boundary issue even if we decided we had no jurisdiction,

19

if we decided that the district court had no jurisdiction

20

over the question.

21

holding that the district court lacked jurisdiction of a

22

third-party complaint against Mississippi would require

23

vacation of the judgment against the state and leave

24

Mississippi free to litigate the boundary issue anew.

25

That's what it says.

MR. McCARTNEY:

Yes.

I thought

It says a

1

QUESTION:

I thought you might concede --

2

MR. McCARTNEY:

What we're saying there was that

3

we recognize that this Court could reconsider its 1988

4

decision to defer --

5

QUESTION:

Right.

And suppose we do that?

6

thought that was the question you were being asked.

7

Suppose we do that, isn't Mississippi then free to

8

relitigate the boundary issue?
MR. McCARTNEY:

9
10

QUESTION:

11

MR. McCARTNEY:

12

I

Yes, Your Honor.

Okay.
If that's the question I was

asked, then it's very clear.

13

QUESTION:

Maybe I misunderstood it.

14

MR. McCARTNEY:

Yes.

If this Court were to

15

reconsider, and we would urge after of course a very

16

lengthy period of litigation that it not do so, but if it

17

were to do so then we feel it would be free, and neither

18

Louisiana nor Mississippi would be bound by the district

19

court's decision.
QUESTION:

20
21

22

But as it stands -Although the title decision would

stand.
MR. McCARTNEY:

We believe that the title

23

decision would likely follow the determination of the

24

boundary, but I will have to say that I'm not clear on

25

that and that is frankly the best I can do.

QUESTION:

1

Well, we wouldn't -- if we granted,

2

if we granted a motion for leave to file an original

3

action it would just deal with the boundary, I suppose.

4

We wouldn't be deciding title.

5
6

MR. McCARTNEY:

That's correct, Your Honor.

It

would be left to another day to decide the title.

7

QUESTION:

And of course if Louisiana had never

8

intervened into this case Mississippi could have remained

9

in it and litigated the title.

MR. McCARTNEY:

QUESTION:

15
16

Louisiana brought Mississippi

Oh, oh.
Louisiana brought Mississippi --

Mississippi wasn't a party at the

outset?
MR. McCARTNEY:

No, Your Honor.

Louisiana --

17

and that was the third issue on cert, was the third-party

18

complaint by Louisiana against Mississippi within the

19

jurisdiction of the district court.

20
21

QUESTION:

But do you agree that Mississippi

would be equally free to litigate the boundary issue --

MR. McCARTNEY:

QUESTION:

Yes.

respect to the boundary issue but we, for whatever reason,

do not disturb the judgment with respect to the title

issue, the private title issue?
MR. McCARTNEY:

You're referring to the Fifth

Circuit's judgment of the district court's judgment?

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. McCARTNEY:

Yes, the Fifth Circuit judgment.
The Fifth Circuit judgment.

6

I'll have to return to my original answer that I believe

7

that the Court, if it were to vacate, would leave the

8

title question to a later date but that it would have a

9

distinct impact on the title issue.

10
11

Perhaps I could put

it that way.
QUESTION:

In other words I think you're saying

12

that we could not consistently vacate the judgment with

13

respect to the boundary and leave the judgment with

14

respect to the private title as it is, as the Fifth

15

of the proceeding?

conclusive, saying that the objective was to bring the

21

thalweg, or main channel as it's called, back to the west

22

of the island, and if it's going to be brought back

23

obviously it has to have been there at some time.

24

are examples that more than demonstrate the permissible

finding by the trial court that this was Mississippi land.

ultimate finding very clearly, that if it was wrong with

This is a pure fact question, and it is a

complex fact question, and the trial court heard the

evidence on it and it made the finding.

competing notions about that.

2

Harrison held that in fact the remnants of what were Stack

3

4

completely eroded away by the time the Louisiana riparian

5

sections starting rebuilding through the accretionary

process.

QUESTION:

other words was there evidence on that score from which

9

the trial judge could have gone either way?
MR. KEYSER:

10

No.

In

No, there was no contrary

11

testimony.

The trial judge simply concluded that 8 miles

12

of accretion from above Lake Providence to below the

13

corner in the reach of the river, thousands of acres, was

14

really no more than the original 117-acre Stack Island,

15

less erosion, plus accretion, but he failed to consider,

16

although all the maps show, that the accretion which

17

filled up the Louisiana bank simply restored the radiating

18

sections which Louisiana patented out of its state land

19

office over 100 years ago.

20

So the trial judge's theory, like the

21

petitioners', was an island can move laterally across the

river and grow and become a part of the bank in Louisiana

ergo it's still an island or once was and those remnants

that by building a series of dikes out of the north end of

Were you able to authenticate that

report in any way other than as an official document as to

qualifications of the people on the commission were?

5

MR. KEYSER:

We didn't get into the history of

6

the Mississippi River Commission.

It was stipulated

7

between counsel that it was an authentic report, that it

was a Government document, that it indeed was reported to

experts, Mr. Harrison and Dr. Easterly, testified from it.

12

from it.

15

QUESTION:

Well, did he express doubt as to its

correctness?
MR. KEYSER:

No, his version was that what the

16

language really meant was that the main channel of the

17

river was always to the right of the island and that there

18

was no avulsion in 1882-1883 because the river was always

19

to the right of the island, which is contrary to the plain

20

reading of the report itself, which --

21

QUESTION:

have been free to discount the usefulness of the report?

12

Mississippi, being the plaintiff in the case, never used

14

didn't put those exhibits on because their theory at trial

was the river was subject to two avulsive actions which

that they occurred sometime around 1912-1913.

So we responded to their case at trial,

Well, when Mr. Smith testified he only testified

19

about one avulsion which he claimed was due to the

20

flooding of 1912-1913 which he concludes happened because

21

he has some tables of river elevations of that year which

22

he said demonstrated a flood which apparently enlarged the

23

chute channel to the east of Stack Island, meaning that

But even Mr. Smith only said it apparently

2

enlarged the chute channel.

3

prior to the 1912-1913 claimed floods, I showed him maps

4

of 1908, 1909, 1911 from the U.S. Geological Survey, that

5

showed that the channel was already occupied with the main

6

channel of the river, the chute channel, he refused to

7

discuss it.

8

Louisiana must have rigged those maps up or something to

9

that effect.

And when I showed him maps

He said the maps were unwholly and that

So we disproved the northerly avulsion which he

10
11

really didn't even clearly testify to, and as to the

12

southerly avulsion, which would have the boundary going a

13

couple of miles inland 8 or 9 miles downstream, he had no

14

testimony whatsoever.
Then in the Fifth Circuit, after the Fifth

15
16

Circuit reversed and rendered, the petitioners changed

17

their theory to the time of sovereignty.

18

Fifth Circuit was in error in using the 1881-1882 avulsion

19

caused by the Mississippi River Commission.

Circuit should have looked to much earlier periods of

time.

Certainly the

In our briefing we have pointed out that in all

The boundary must be decided in the

I have looked through the law and find no exception to the

the district court had to predetermine its jurisdiction

and thence the outcome of the case before it even heard

jurisdictional finality they did have jurisdiction.

Is that because of the presence of

14

third parties or because of the order of this Court, or

15

both?
MR. KEYSER:

16

I would say it's because of the

17

jurisprudence in the orders of this Court declining to

18

take jurisdiction itself, thereby giving the district

19

court the suitable alternative forum, implicit

20

jurisdiction to hear and determine all issues.
QUESTION:

I see.

You don't contest that we

could have taken original jurisdiction if we had chosen to

do so?

that was a judgment of ours?

MR. KEYSER:

Only that the district court must

then be vested with sufficient jurisdiction to hear and

determine all issues.

that the Court had found that to be the suitable

alternative forum beside the Supreme --

7

QUESTION:

Implicit in that ruling would be

Well, I'd say implicit in the ruling

8

is that the judges that voted that way probably thought

9

that, but does it have the force of a judgment of this

10

Court that there is jurisdiction?
MR. KEYSER:

11

12

does.

13

not it does.

As a practical matter it certainly

I don't know as a technical legal matter whether or

QUESTION:

Isn't it at least theoretically

15

possible, maybe this isn't what the majority was actually

16

thinking then, but that the Court might have thought that

17

the title issue could have been resolved without resolving

18

the boundary issue and that the district court was an

19

adequate forum for that purpose?

20

MR. KEYSER:

I don't know how the Court could

21

have reached that conclusion.

22

QUESTION:

Well, lots of times the ownership of

23

land could be in the same party even though he thinks he's

in Mississippi when in fact he turns out to be in a

25

different jurisdiction.

they are, they could be regarded as separate issues.

2

Maybe not on the facts of this case after you get into it.
MR. KEYSER:

3

Because of the interstate boundary

4

issue I made a rather concerted effort to point out that

5

this case did deal with an interstate boundary, that it

6

involved the Treaty of Paris, that it involved acts of

7

Congress, that it involved statutes of the United States,

8

and I did everything I could to draw the court's attention

9

to that.

10

QUESTION:

I'm not sure any of that would be

11

conclusive on the question whether the boundary issue

12

would also necessarily determine the title issue.

13

all I'm saying.

14

understand it well enough.

15

That's

Maybe it is, I just don't know,

MR. KEYSER:

Well, in our view if the boundary

16

is drawn in its proper place all of the lands at issue

17

remain in Louisiana as they were patented out, thereby the

18

only claim that the Mississippi people would have would be

19

one of adverse possession or acquiescence, and they

20

certainly can't prove either of those.

21

QUESTION:

On the facts of this case, but I

22

suppose it's at least theoretically possible, isn't it,

23

that a Mississippi citizen could acquire land in Louisiana

24

by adverse possession?

MR. KEYSER:

I would agree with that.

QUESTION:

I suppose it doesn't make a whole lot

2

of difference to the state who owns it, does it, so long

3

as the state has sovereignty over it?

4

MR. KEYSER:

I would agree with that.

Our port

has water frontage because of the boundary drawn by

7

petitioner's expert, and the riparian owners from above

a mile inland from the river.

And that, of course, and that

pertains to the title, not to the boundary?

MR. KEYSER:

I certainly could.

it was not generally recognized that they were Mississippi

Jelly and Horsefly said they were acts of adverse
