ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN TREBON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TREBON:

10
11

Thank you, Mr.

Mr. Trebon.

Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether or not the

12

13

courts below correctly applied Rules 404(b) and 403 of the

14

Federal Rules of Evidence in order to assure a fair trial

15

below.

16

More specifically, if the issue of intent is not

17

a disputed issue at trial, and the defense offers a

18

genuine, judicial admission on the issue of intent, should

19

the prosecution be allowed to admit overwhelming amounts

20

of uncharged misconduct evidence under the ruse of proving

21

the marginal statutory issue of intent, and secondly,

22

should the prosecution be allowed to ambush the accused

23

with eleventh-hour prior bad conduct evidence?

24

Let me highlight some of the facts in this case.

Mr. Hadley was a teacher in Chilchinbeto, Arizona, a rural

agents that Mr. Hadley may have a tendency to be a

8

seventh, and eighth graders in Chilchinbeto -- over 75

9

students -- and asked them specifically about Mr. Hadley.

As a result, the FBI interviewed all sixth,

10

There were no identified victims, and Mr. Hadley was not

11

known to be a suspect before any of these interviews

12

commenced.

13

During the same time, during the pendency of

14

this case, there were congressional hearings regarding

15

what was perceived as an epidemic of child molestation on

16

the Navajo Indian Reservation.

17

besides Cory K., who testified as a prior bad act witness,

18

never mentioned that Mr. Hadley had touched or molested

19

them to anyone else other than the FBI either before or

20

after the interviews.

21

The victims in this case,

During the FBI interviews, many students at

22

trial testified that the FBI told them that they knew that

Mr. Hadley had touched other students and they were only

24

interested to find out if he had touched them, too.

QUESTION:

11

Mr. Trebon, how does this bear on the

12

questions presented here, which seem to deal mostly with

13

Rule 403?
MR. TREBON:

14

That's true.

What I'm trying to

15

show in this case, that there were genuine disputes about

16

what occurred in this particular case, and the problem

17

with 404(b) evidence is that it tends to draw the

18

attention of the jurors away from the facts in dispute in

19

this case, and tend to paint the defendant as a bad person

20

or show that he has a predisposition for committing these

21

types of offenses, and in this case that's exactly what it

22

did.

23

The prior bad act evidence was absolutely

24

overwhelming.

1

not be fairly decided.

Intent was the basis for admitting

2

the prior bad conduct evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, and

3

intent in this case was merely a marginal issue required

4

by Federal statute.

5

QUESTION:

Federal -Well, it's an issue like any other

6

element of a crime in which the Government bears a burden

7

of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, isn't it?

8

9

MR. TREBON:

Yes, Chief Justice, that's true,

but the intent required in this case was merely the

10

statute follows the model penal code which requires that

11

when you touch someone that you do it with the desire to

12

harass, humiliate, to arouse or satisfy the sexual desire

13

of any person.

14

statute merely to distinguish innocent or accidental

15

touchings from intentional or sexual touchings.

16
17
18

In other words, it was placed in the

QUESTION:

But it's still there, and the

Government has to prove it.
MR. TREBON:

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice, it

19

is there, and the Government does have to prove it.

20

point here is that there's not much there to prove.

21

QUESTION:

My

Well, as to count IX, I take it that

22

there could have been a plausible defense that the actions

23

did occur but that they were innocent.

24
25

MR. TREBON:

Theoretically, Justice Kennedy,

that's true, but no such defense was put forward, number

Government needed a prior bad act to establish what was

3

going on in count IX, was established by count VIII.

V

4
5

QUESTION:

Did he deny that the count IX acts

occurred at all?

6

MR. TREBON:

Yes.

He occurred that both count

7

VIII and count IX acts occurred, and count VIII, of

8

course, the same type of conduct allegedly went further,

9

so there was no question about what was supposedly taking

10

place when count IX evidence was presented.

11

occurs during October of '87, count IX evidence occurs

12

during November of 1987, so again, the issue of intent was

13

merely - -

QUESTION:

Do you have to - - I thought you were

15

arguing that just as a per se rule that if - - there's a

stipulation about intent, that if these acts occurred,

17

they occurred intentionally, that that -- then no prior

conduct evidenceshouldbe admitted.

Justice White, we are not saying

that there's a per serule.

saying that the offer to stipulate as to the issue of

2

intent should have been a factor considered under Rule

3

403, and moreover, if it had been a factor considered

4

under Rule 403, in this case it would have tipped the

5

balance in favor of exclusion of all this massive amount

6

of prior misconduct evidence to prove an issue of intent

7

that was transparent from the nature of the acts alone.

QUESTION:

Mr. Trebon, the Government contends

that there were other purposes for introducing it that

10

supported its relevance in the case and not just its

11

relevance to the intent.

12

MR. TREBON:

What do you say to that?

Well, Justice Scalia, first of all

13

it could have never been considered for any other purpose

14

in this case.

15

only consider the evidence for motive, intent and

16

preparation, and planning, number 1.

That language was thrown in immediately

before it went to the jury.
The trial court also instructed the jury that

things as, you know, why he invited children to his home.

MR. TREBON:

QUESTION:

Justice Scalia -But I must say that if the

instruction was you must first establish from other

evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the acts occurred,

then it would have been irrelevant to the planning,

rendered irrelevant by that mistake was therefore

2

improperly admitted?
MR. TREBON:

3

In other words, we don't know how

4

much calculus the jury added to the weight of this

5

evidence at trial, and it would be impossible to

6

redetermine that if we submit it to the jury for another

7

purpose when we know they didn't consider it for that

8

purpose.
In this particular case, we know that we

10

couldn't do that.

12

might be a different situation.
QUESTION:

I don't know that -- if you have

Are the instructions in the appendix

that you refer to?
MR. TREBON:

15

Yes, Your Honor, they are.

This

16

particular instruction I believe appears in the Joint

17

Appendix twice, and it's on page 75, as I recall.

instruction was given both before the -- or, after the

testimony of Kyle Hartman and before the testimony of Cory

QUESTION:

Is it correct that plan was neither

an element of any offense charged nor an issue in the case

as it was tried?

Yes, Justice Souter, that is true,

It's not a

The prior bad acts, unfortunately, that were

5
6

admitted in this case, occurred 13 to 17 years earlier in

7

the case of Kyle Hartman and several years earlier in the

8

case of Cory K., and of course the reason that they were

9

so prejudicial, if anyone has any question about that, is

10

because they were unspecified.
When the Government filed a motion in limine

11

12

several months before trial, they said we want to

13

introduce particular prior bad acts relating to three

14

people.

15

those people never testified, and Cory K. was one of them,

16

but when he got on the stand he testified about numerous

17

unspecified prior bad acts.

18

Well, two of those people recanted, so two of

In the Government's brief, they concede 10 to 20

prior bad acts between he and Mr. Hadley that we had no

1

MR. TREBON:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think it

2

does to the extent when we weigh the amount of evidence

3

necessary to establish intent in this case and we weigh

4

the heavy amount of effect that the prior misconduct

5

evidence had, we can see, I hope it crystallizes the

6

notion, that a stipulation would have taken care of the

7

matter or significantly changed --

8

9

QUESTION:

Yes, I understand that point, but I

don't understand how that point is aided by your

10

contention that you had no notice of what this witness was

11

going to testify to, that you were surprised.

12

MR. TREBON:

Well, actually, in Rule 403, unfair

13

surprise was kept out of the rule itself but it's in the

14

comment, and it says that's also a factor for the trial

15

judge to consider.

16

they're surprised, then obviously the trial court should

17

naturally weigh against the introduction of such evidence.

18

If there hasn't been prior notice and

In this case, it's another factor to attach to

have changed - -

QUESTION:

Well, supposing you have a crime

defined as consisting of four elements, do you think a

23

defendant can come into court and say, I'll stipulate to

three of these elements and therefore the Government

25

should not be allowed to introduce any evidence on those

2

MR. TREBON:

would not be allowed.

QUESTION:

5

MR. TREBON:

I think in the usual case that

Why not?
Because the Government is allowed

6

to put forth its full evidence, the moral force of its

7

evidence on the elements at stake.

8

they're intrinsic acts, Mr. Chief Justice, if the acts

9

that you're trying to stipulate out of the case are

13

In other words, if

intrinsic to the case itself -QUESTION:

Well, I'm talking about elements of

the crime to stipulate out of a case, and not acts.
MR. TREBON:

Well, I think -- then I would make

14

another distinction.

15

elements with the use of prior misconduct evidence under

16

404(b), then, of course, you have to consider the parallel

17

provisions of Rule 403, and then a stipulation must be a

18

factor to be weighed by the trial court, so in that

19

situation I'd say you'd at least have to weigh it out.

20

QUESTION:

If you intend to prove one of those

You say anytime, then, that a

21

defendant offers to stipulate to an element of a crime

22

charged, and the Government wishes to use some sort of

prior bad acts evidence, the stipulation is a factor

regardless of anything else.

MR. TREBON:

Sure.

1

least a factor the trial court should consider in

2

determining whether or not the incremental probative value

3

of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair

4

prejudice, and in this case, of course, the stipulation

5

would have easily taken care of the problem.

6

We had an issue of intent that was necessarily

7

inferred from the nature of the act alone.

I mean, there

8

was no question that if someone touched someone the way

of a crime, that he was touching these children

improperly.

I thought a moment ago you

I think the Government should have

been required to stipulate in this case.

Mr. Chief Justice, in this case it was appropriate to

accept that stipulation in lieu of the evidence.

In other words,

QUESTION:

Well --

QUESTION:

You said that a moment ago that

for -- if the Government's going to use bad acts evidence

11

and refuses to stipulate, that should be a factor, an

12

admission of bad acts.

13

couldn't refuse to stipulate.

14

quite the same as what you said a moment ago.

15

MR. TREBON:

Now you say the Government
I thought -- that isn't

I'm sorry, let me try to clarify

it.

17

essential element of the statute when the Government is

18

trying to admit prior bad act evidence to prove that

19

point, that the offer to stipulate in lieu of the prior

20

bad act evidence is a factor that the trial court should

21

weigh within the balancing processes of Rule 403.

22

I'm saying that if you offer to stipulate to an

I take it another way of saying that

is the Government can be required to stipulate as a

24

precondition to the admission of the prior bad acts.

the Government could be required to stipulate instead of

allowing the prior bad acts.

exactly that.

QUESTION:

5

MR. TREBON:

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

Rule 403 comments say

All right.

All right.

Yes.
Of course, you're not even arguing --

7

you're not even going that far here.

All you really have

8

to establish, I guess, is that at least it should have

9

been taken into account.

What you're arguing here is not

10

that it necessarily should have been excluded because

11

there was no stipulation, but at least you should have

12

considered the refusal to stipulate in deciding whether it

13

should have been admitted or not.

14

MR. TREBON:

Well, Justice Scalia, you're

15

correct, although I suppose my position now would be that

16

now that the Government's conceded in their brief that

17

everyone, according to the Government, agrees that it

18

should be a factor considered under Rule 403, I'd like to

19

go on and convince you that in this case you can see by

20

looking at the relevant factors it would have changed the

21

equation, that if the stipulation would have been

22

accepted, then the need for this evidence is obviously

23

trivial and the prejudice from it is overwhelming.

24

other words, it stopped Mr. Hadley from getting a fair

25

trial.

And I think you do one other important thing.

2

Speaking as a trial lawyer before this honorable Court,

3

the practice now at trial is for the prosecutor to come in

at the trial level and spotlight one of the other purposes

under Rule 404(b) as a facade for getting masses of

amounts of prior misconduct evidence before the jury,

because we all know - - I think the comments to the rules

support it, all the scholars support it, and a milieu of

case law supports it - -

QUESTION:

11

MR. TREBON:

12
13

Well -That once that evidence comes in,

it's misused.
QUESTION:

It seems to me that you are just

14

asking us to disagree with the two courts below that this

15

evidence was admissible and that it wasn't too

prejudicial, and you say it shouldn't have been admitted

because the equation was such that it shouldn't have been

admitted, which means that this is just sort of a fact-

MR. TREBON:

Well, I think that both -- Justice

The - - what I think - - and where I think I can

perhaps explain what I think the judge had in mind by the

combination of the basis for admission and the instruction

was that the judge was focusing on the fact that these

witnesses corroborated one another.

The two witnesses in question, Amadee R. and

that Amadee R.'s testimony bears on:

1) the question of

whether the event occurred, but 2) and significantly for

purposes of the instruction, the question of whether his

testimony reflects intent on the part of the defendant, so

if you believe that that event occurred as Amadee R.

MR. BRYSON:

It should be, and it was in this

case, Your Honor.

16

The district judge in this case said on several

17

occasions that this particular stipulation on this record

18

simply doesn't give the Government the equivalent of that

19

evidence, that 404(b) evidence.

20

The judge was very careful in his 403 balancing

21

in this case, and he looked time and again at the

22

stipulation, even suggested an alternative form of the

23

stipulation that counsel could propose that might well

24

displace the need for the 404(b) evidence.

Well, the court's concept was that

if you look at the similarity in the Cory K. testimony and

18

the Amadee R. testimony it establishes a modus operandi,

essentially, is what he was talking about with plan and

probative of modus operandi which in turn reflects one of

the ultimate elements of the crime, yes, Your Honor,

certainly, and that bears -- that turns on whether there's

great similarity in the prior bad acts.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BRYSON:

9

QUESTION:

Why was the stipulation inadequate?
Well, let me turn to that.
You said that the trial judge found

10

that merely telling the jury, look it's conceded he had

11

the intent if he did the acts.

12

MR. BRYSON:

Why wasn't that enough?

Well, here are the reasons, and let

13

me just go down the reasons that I think the stipulation

14

was inadequate.

15

First of all there -- the attack, as I've

16

mentioned, on the witnesses was the suggestion that they

17

had simply fabricated this evidence.

18

the Government to corroborate those witnesses in some way

19

in order for the jury to believe the witnesses.

20

the jury believed the witnesses or not obviously went to

the issues not only of intent but also whether the crime

22

was committed.

exclude corroboration, and the judge said explicitly -QUESTION:

2

Well, I mean, it did not allow its

3

use for corroboration, did it?

4

MR. BRYSON:

It spoke only of ultimate issues,

5

Your Honor.

6

this for corroboration, but in saying that you may use

7

this for intent of preparation or plan, what the judge

8

clearly contemplated was that the jury could use this to

9

corroborate witnesses whose testimony in turn would bear

10
11
12

I mean, it didn't say explicitly you may use

on intent.
QUESTION:

You say he should have let him use it

for that, even if he didn't.

3

MR. BRYSON:

4

QUESTION:

Yes, that's right.
Yes, but their testimony would also

5

bear on whether or not the acts occurred, and it seems to

6

me that in this case 90 percent of the thrust of the

7

testimony is whether or not the acts occurred, and 90

8

percent of the corroboration that you obtained by

9

introducing these prior acts is that the acts occurred,

20

and that intent is not fictional, but it is de minimis or

21

insignificant.

MR. BRYSON:

2

ground, I think, on which the district court properly

3

refused to take the stipulation, and that is, this is

4

really not a case in which there was a concession as to

5

intent, but the theory of the defense case, again, was

6

that I -- and this was his testimony:

I had -- sure, I had a lot of contact with these

children.

I dealt with them on a regular basis, but it

His defense was that I do not have the

didn't commit them.

QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, on the basis of that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN TREBON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

weak modus operandi case.

If corroboration is used so broadly that if

crime A is on trial and you corroborate to another person

that crime B was committed, that's not corroborating

There's no difference between the two.

MR. TREBON:

Yes.
At all.
Yes.

We deny that he touched

them -- the particular acts in question.

13

playground as their teacher, and so forth, but we denied

all of the acts in question.

So this was a trial about whether or not these

acts occurred, or whether or not they were prompted,

17

similarly to many other witnesses who testified at trial,

18

prompted by the FBI to make accusations against

19

Mr. Hadley.

20

It was a case that necessitated a full-blown

21

exploration on the particular acts in question, and all we

22

did by admitting all the prior bad act evidence is to

23

change the focus of the trial to events that occurred 13

to 17 years earlier, and certainly was extremely

prejudicial.

emotional -- that the emotional propensity of child

2

molestation is extremely high, and limiting instructions

3

in this area are very ineffective.

4

I don't believe that the Government can have it

5

both ways with the jury instruction, too.

6

Judge Carroll had this broad idea about plan evidence but

7

yet instructed the jury that they couldn't consider the

8

evidence for anything other than mental state.

9

You can't say

You had to determine independently whether or no

10

the acts occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, so clearly

11

none of this evidence could have been considered at the

12

trial level to determine the actus reus of the case.

13

That's simply implausible under the jury instruction that

14

was given by Judge Carroll.

QUESTION:

Well, what if the instruction was in

16

fact wrong?

17

admissability of evidence, not its use by the jury.

18

What we're talking about here is

MR. TREBON:

Well, this was admitted for a

19

limited purpose, as all 404(b) is.

You only can admit

20

404(b) evidence, Mr. Chief Justice, if you identify one of

21

the other purposes that it's allowed for under the rule,

22

and, as this Court noted in Huddleston -- indeed, as

23

Mr. Chief Justice wrote for a unanimous Court, under

24

Rule 105 you have to give a limiting instruction if it's

25

requested when 404(b) evidence is admitted.
