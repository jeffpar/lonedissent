CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ms. McKeown.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF M. MARGARET McKEOWN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. McKEOWN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue before you is whether a court reporter

11

who fails to produce a transcript is entitled to absolute

12

judicial immunity, thus overcoming the presumption of

13

qualified immunity which has been found to be sufficient

14

protection for the vast majority of public and Government

15

officials, ranging from presidential aides to the attorney

16

general, other cabinet officers, governors, police

17

officers, and school board members.

18

We submit that the Ninth Circuit ruling, that

19

the doctrine of judicial immunity bars Mr. Antoine's suit

20

simply because the court reporter is part and parcel of

21

the judicial process, expands the immunity doctrine beyond

22

the Court's decisions and certainly far beyond its

23

historical scope.

24

The case comes here in a situation where over

25

3-year period the court reporter ignored numerous court

1

orders, failed to file the transcript, and, in fact,

2

violated show cause orders from the Ninth Circuit.

3

Finally, after 3 years, she was unable to produce a

4

complete transcript and a substitute reporter was able to

5

file a reconstructed transcript which was admittedly

6

deficient.

7

We ask the Court to rule that a court reporter's

8

function is not adjudicatory, it is not a judicial

9

function, and she is not entitled to absolute immunity

10

from suit for damages.

11

issue, but the answer can be found in the Court's cases on

12

judicial immunity.

13

The circuits are split on this

The starting point in the immunity analysis is

14

that the presumption is that there is gualified immunity.

15

So here it's not a question of absolute immunity or

16

nothing, but rather starting with a presumption of

17

qualified immunity.

18

granted so sparingly and has generally been regarded as

19

such an extreme measure, there is a very heavy burden on

20

the respondents to justify elevation from qualified to

21

absolute immunity.

22

And because absolute immunity must be

No justification exists here.

Certainly, the

23

court reporter doesn't serve a function so special or so

24

sensitive as to require a total shield from liability.

25

Nor is the real purpose of judicial immunity, that is

1

preservation of independent decision making, preventing

2

the chilling of making hard and difficult decisions,

3

served in this particular case because, of course, the

4

court reporter makes no such decisions and has no such

5

discretion to chill.
I would like to turn, then, to a discussion of a

6

7

judicial act and adjudication.
QUESTION:

8

9

The threshold question —

Well, may I interrupt you?

Do you

suppose that a judge would have absolute immunity in

10

certifying a case record for appellate review, for

11

example?

12

MS. McKEOWN:

Yes.

I believe that a judge

13

certifying a record for appellate review is acting in his

14

judicial capacity.

15

by the judge, and that really is an extension — we're

16

assuming a trial judge — of the decision-making process

17

in which the judge has engaged on the trial level.

18

QUESTION:

That is a function normally performed

Although you could certainly say

19

that's a ministerial sort of act, couldn't you?

20

the trial judge kept notes during that proceedings that

21

became relevant on appeal and they had to be sent up, do

22

you suppose that's part of the judicial act?

23

MS. McKEOWN:

What if

Let me answer your first question,

24

and that is whether this judge's certification might be

25

deemed to be ministerial.

And it might; there is not an

1

absolute line that can always be drawn.

But certainly in

2

the case of a judge, one needs to look to the scope of

3

judge's authority, and it's a fairly broad decision-making

4

authority, in contrast to the very limited authority of

5

the court reporter.
Taking your second situation, and that is assume

6

7

that the judge makes notes during the process and those

8

are used in some fashion on appeal, it would appear that

9

those notes would be made as part of the decision-making

10

process, not as a part of recording simply a verbatim

11

transcript of what went on in the courtroom.
So there's a far bigger distinction there

12

13

between the note taking by the judge, which might be akin

14

to historical note taking by the judge in which he had

15

absolute immunity and was taking notes so that he could

16

comment on the evidence and summarize matters for the

17

jury.

18

a part of the decision-making process, but rather simply

19

pursuant to statute and court order.

But surely a court reporter is not taking notes as

20

QUESTION:

Suppose the judge —

21

QUESTION:

So — excuse me.

22

QUESTION:

Suppose the judge knowingly keeps on

23

an inept court reporter who's always late, is having

24

health problems, et cetera, and two or three transcripts

25

are delayed or lost, can the judge be sued?

MS. McKEOWN:

1

In that particular situation, that

2

would come somewhat close to Forrester, of a hiring and

3

firing decision which may be an administrative act rather

4

than a judicial act by the judge.

5

QUESTION:

6

MS. McKEOWN:

7

qualified immunity.

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Does it —
But in any event, there would be

Ms. McKeown, I can't hear you like

that.
MS. McKEOWN:

Yes.

In any event, there would be

11

qualified immunity in that case, and it may well be that

12

the decision, albeit not an adjudicative one, would not be

13

subject to suit because there was qualified immunity.

14

QUESTION:

Well, what would be — is there any

15

potential judicial liability simply by virtue of the fact

16

that the reporter may be held liable?

17

about a respondeat superior here?

18

Are we talking

Because I would suppose — for example, in

19

Justice Kennedy's case, I mean he's posing an example in

20

which the judge's decision is a decision which is made on

21

the administrative rather than the adjudicative side of

22

the dichotomy in his duties, so that if the — if the

23

reporter is negligent and the judge was negligent in

24

keeping the reporter on, I assume there's going to be —

25

could there be respondeat superior negligence here?

1

MS. McKEOWN:

If it's determined that the

2

judge's conduct was adjudicative in nature, then there

3

would be absolute immunity and you would not reach the

4

respondeat superior.

5

QUESTION:

Well, if it wasn't.

I mean what if

6

the judge simply has an incompetent court reporter and

7

keeps the incompetent court reporter on, and the reporter

8

then causes damages?

9

for his own negligence, or — and B, would the judge, in

10

11

Is the judge going to be liable, A,

any event, be liable on a respondeat superior theory?
MS. McKEOWN:

As to whether the judge would be

12

liable in negligence, most likely if the judge is given

13

qualified immunity, then the judge's, in effect, good

14

faith and following his own procedures would exempt him

15

from liability.

16

QUESTION:

But what if he knows that he's got a

17

incompetent there and he's — he's a kind person, he

18

doesn't want to fire this person, and just keeps the

19

incompetent reporter on?

20

believe that the law gives him a privilege to inflict

21

incompetent reporters on the parties, so there's not going

22

to be any good faith defense, is there?

23

MS. McKEOWN:

He doesn't have any reason to

If there is not a — sufficient

24

evidence to meet the qualified immunity test, it may also

25

be that there's no cause of action because, generally,

1

civil rights claims based solely on negligence would not

2

rise to the level of stating a claim under Bivens or

3

section 1983.

4

QUESTION:

Well, how about State law?

5

QUESTION:

Yeah.

6

MS. McKEOWN:

There would be a State law —

7

there would be a potential negligence claim under State

law.

QUESTION:

Do you think qualified immunity would

QUESTION:

MS. McKEOWN:

15

Would qualified immunity be of use

Yeah.
As a practical matter, yes,

From the cases that have been

brought against —
QUESTION:

Would you think the reporter would

have some doubt about what his or her duties were?
MS. McKEOWN:

Well, there's — there's various

24

cases which have been brought where the court reporters

25

have been granted qualified immunity.

For example, simply

following the judge's instructions.
QUESTION:

2

Well I think — I didn't ask you

3

whether they were entitled to qualified immunity.

4

they are.

I think

But I wonder what good it will do them.

5

MS. McKEOWN:

Well, I think it would do them

6

good because there are circumstances in which I believe

7

they would meet the qualified immunity test.

8

QUESTION:

Like — like what?

9

MS. McKEOWN:

A good example would be where the

10

judge, perhaps as part of his decision-making process, has

11

a vendetta against a particular litigant, but gives the

12

court reporter an order, for example, don't produce the

13

transcript for 6 months.

14

reporter, following the duties that is given to her by the

15

judge, would be able to avail herself of qualified

16

immunity.

17

QUESTION:

There it would appear the court

Well, it may be, but it would seem to

18

me to be — it would be the odd circumstance where

19

qualified immunity would be — would do much good.

20

nevertheless, I would think the reporters would win an

21

awful lot of cases because of — you know, they just —

22

they just haven't broken the State law or they certainly

23

haven't stated a cause of action for a civil rights

24

violation.

25

QUESTION:

Do we know that they would have

6

I mean our cases have all involved constitutional

MS. McKEOWN:

That's correct.

There — there

are —
QUESTION:

Have we ever said that you must give

7

a reporter, or anybody, any Government officer, qualified

8

immunity under State law?

9

MS. McKEOWN:

Well, it would appear under the

10

Westfall decision that the immunity analysis should end up

11

the same whether a Federal cause of action or a State

12

cause of action, certainly against a Federal official.

13

There are some circumstances where States have their own

14

immunity statutes, and in some of those they even

15

implicate court reporters, for example, and they do have

16

immunity under their State law provisions.

17

QUESTION:

Yeah, but what — what it's meant in

18

connection with the Federal causes of action, which are

19

all constitutional causes of action, has been simply that

20

it has to be, you know, violation of a known

21

constitutional right, intentional violation of a known

22

constitutional right.

23

you're applying it in a constitutional context, but how do

24

you — how do you translate that into a State tort action

for negligence of a — of a court reporter, not claiming

And — and

21

getting back to Justice Scalia's question, what would be

22

the test if you had the Federal reporter but sued under

fashion a test which would be similar to the

25

constitutional-type test, that is whether she was

1

following out her duties and was able to proceed in an

2

expeditious and appropriate fashion under either the

3

statute or rule.

4

QUESTION:

Yeah.

Of course, we developed the

5

other test because we thought it was a fair interpretation

6

of what Congress intended in the congressional statute

7

allowing suit.

8

Bivens' action we just imitate that, but basically it was

9

based upon a congressional intent.

That's how we came to that, and I guess in

And I guess we'd just

10

be making it up for the — or I don't know, some

11

congressional common — some Federal common law principle

12

that requires this to be applied in State causes of

13

action. I don't know.

14

QUESTION:

It's just a new question to me.
Well, you — we've announced that a

15

Federal — certain Federal officers, wholly aside from any

16

statute are — have either absolute or qualified immunity.

17

How about the prosecutor, Federal prosecutor?

18

MS. McKEOWN:

Well, under the — this Court's

19

rulings, the Federal prosecutor, acting in a prosecutorial

20

capacity, has absolute immunity.

21

QUESTION:

22

MS. McKEOWN:

23

Is that based on the statute?
No, that is — that is based on

common law, as well as looking at the —

How about judicial immunity?

essentially on the common law rather than statute or

Constitution.

QUESTION:

4

MS. McKEOWN:

5

Yeah.
And that is essentially extended

with respect to the prosecutor.

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

MS. McKEOWN:

.

Because the prosecutor plays that

8

role.

And that is exactly — that prosecutorial issue

9

really frames why judicial immunity has been granted,

10

because the purpose there is to protect the independent

11

decision making, it is to protect the actual adjudicative

12

process.

13

acts in an eguivalent role to the judge in considering,

14

weighing, and making presentations in evidence.

So the prosecutor, like witnesses or jurors,

Would you help me out on one thing

MS. McKEOWN:

Your recitation of the facts is

exactly the procedure in which the case was brought.

He had both what

Right.
— And a State contract claim.

The — as I understand the respondents' position, it was

10

that absolute immunity would bar either of those cases.

11

But the court below, having decided that absolute immunity

12

would take effect, essentially dismissed without prejudice

13

his State cause — State law cause of action.

14

QUESTION:

So that if — in other words, if he

15

overpaid the court reporter, he paid her a couple hundred

16

dollars more than he should have and sued to get his money

back, she could just put it in her pocket and say I'm

sorry, I'm absolutely immune?

But that's — you think that's, in

effect, what was held here.

Yes.

Is she a Federal employee?

know of any cases in which a judge was — was sued for

I don't know of cases where the

judge was sued for a failed — failure to compile the

MS. McKEOWN:
QUESTION:

10

Thank you.

Was the conclusion in those articles

11

that the notes themselves were actually shipped up to —

12

either to an appellate court or to the court sitting in a

13

law term, if it was an old nisi prius judge, so that those

14

notes actually functioned as the equivalent of today's

15

verbatim transcript?

16

MS. McKEOWN:

No, that — that is not the

17

conclusion that Professor Langbein drew.

18

the opposite, it's that those notes were taken during the

19

trial and then were used in the summing up process to the

20

jury.

21

the king would go back to the judge for a recommendation

on — in a capital case, to ask the judge to go back and

And, of course, the notion of a

verbatim transcript was not even mandatory in the Federal

3

courts until 1944.

What we are suggesting is that the threshold

absolute immunity from suit.

3

QUESTION:

Well, why — why should a Federal

4

employee, like the respondent in this case, have any sort

5

of immunity granted by Federal law if it's a simple

6

contract claim under the law of the State of Washington?

7

MS. McKEOWN:

Well, there is some suggestion

8

that there would be no immunity in such situations.

9

we would be willing, of course, to accept that rule.

And
The

10

concern is that given the court reporter obviously having

11

some association with the judicial process, that there may

12

be some reluctance to go that far.

13

course, ideally would be that she has no immunity because

14

everything she does is totally ministerial and

15

nonjudicial.

16

QUESTION:

Our position, of

Yes, but one could disagree with you

17

on that position so far as any claim based on Federal law

against her, and perhaps any claim based — based on a

cognate State law.

20

hypothesized by Justice Stevens, where the defendant

21

claims that he overpaid $200 for a transcript, it strikes

22

me that whether the Federal law ought to impose on the

23

State law system in immunity is quite debatable.

24
25

MS. McKEOWN:

I would agree with that.

1

this to go back to the State court, we would argue no

2

immunity with respect, certainly, to the contract action.

3

But that the only issue that comes before this Court, of

4

course, is this particular Bivens Federal claim and what

5

the immunity is with respect to that.
QUESTION:

6

But not the tort action.

You don't

7

assert that there's no qualified immunity, whatever that

8

means, with respect to a State tort action.

9

distinction between a State tort action and a State

10

You draw a

contract action.
MS. McKEOWN:

11

Well, I wouldn't draw that

12

distinction.

13

that my client has not himself alleged a State tort action

14

on — there is an amended complaint that was pending, and

15

the amendment was not granted because the case was

16

dismissed.

17

At this point in time I have to be candid

In looking at what is a judicial act, the

18

language in the partial concurrence in Burns v. Reed is

19

really quite helpful, because there it was written that

20

the touchstone of the application of judicial immunity is

21

the function of resolving disputes between the parties, or

22

that is authoritatively adjudicating private rights.

23

if you take the situation of what does the court reporter

24

do and does she fall into that description, the answer has

25

to be no.

So

The court reporter, of course, performs a

1

2

stenographic function, produces a verbatim transcript

3

according to very clear rules, and it's a skilled, but

4

it's a ministerial function.

5

is hardly in any respect related to the notion of why we

6

have judicial immunity.

The scope of that activity

The court reporter exercises no independent

judgement, she performs none of the classic adjudicative

9

functions such as evaluation of evidence, like the jury

10

might do.

11

parties and she does nothing that is really central to

12

this truth seeking which is part of the justice system.

13

The central characteristic, then, that is adjudication, is

14

not present with the court reporter.

15

She has no discretion over the rights of the

Secondly, you ask is it an act normally

16

performed by the judge.

17

know it now, that is not part of the judge's normal

function, that is to take a verbatim transcript.

19

could it be said that somehow the court reporter is the

20

judge's alter ego or performs a function which is really

21

comparable to a judge.

22

disservice to the judiciary, to suggest that court

23

reporting is functionally comparable to judging.

24
25

And clearly in the system as we

Nor

I think that certainly would be a

And finally, of course, a necessary but not
determinative point is to go back to the historical

1

analysis.

2

common law, and on that point I believe both parties are

3

in agreement, the question is then asked was there any

4

comparable function.

5

And since there were no court reporters at

And the fact is that there wasn't.

There really

6

was nothing like a verbatim record at common law.

The

7

note taking was for judicial summing up.

8

court clerks who had transcripts, and that was basically

9

just a listing of the pleadings, were entitled to no

And even those

10

immunity because they were performing ministerial acts

11

under the common law.

12

So with those principles in mind, I'd like to

13

turn then to the Ninth Circuit decision and to suggest why

14

that decision is wrong.

15

Circuit did was to grant absolute judicial immunity to

16

anything which is part and parcel of the judicial process.

17

But what that does, basically, is to ignore Forrester, and

18

it really collapses the judicial immunity analysis into an

19

unprecedented association with the judiciary.

20

ought not to be where you sit but what you do.

21

Essentially, what the Ninth

The test

Also, this would be a blanket extension of the

22

notion of absolute judicial immunity to the entire

23

judicial branch.

24

such as Harlow, such an undifferentiated extension cannot

25

be reconciled with the functional approach.

And as we've learned from other cases

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

What it would do, of course, is to place the

1
2

judiciary in a situation superior to the other two

3

branches of Government.

4

cannot be extended in an undifferentiated fashion to his

5

aides, neither can the judiciary's immunity be extended in

6

an undifferentiated fashion to a court reporter.

7

similarly, even in the legislative context from the Gravel

8

case, legislative acts are not all encompassing.

9

Just as the President's immunity

Or

Finally, what the Ninth Circuit also focused on

10

was that this is a very important part of the overall

11

administration of justice and the efficient administration

12

of justice, and therefore there ought to be absolute

13

immunity.

14

fails to distinguish acts that are important to the

15

judicial system from judicial acts.

16

And we would take issue with that because that

The answer to that can best be found in the

17

language of Forrester where the Court, talking about

18

administrative acts, says that they might have been quite

19

important in providing necessary conditions of a sound

20

adjudicative system, but the decisions at issue were not

21

themselves judicial or adjudicative.

22

The second prong of the Forrester test then asks

23

to evaluate what impact would there be were one to grant

24

qualified immunity to court reporters, and what impact

25

would that have on the court reporters' performance of
24

1

their duties.
Starting with a premise that qualified immunity

2

3

is the rule, there's no real reason to place the court

4

reporters in a preferred position above all those other

5

officers mentioned earlier, such as law enforcement

6

officials, presidential aides, who day after day face very

7

difficult, important discretionary decisions, and yet are

8

protected only by qualified immunity.

9

And also, the court reporter can hardly be said

10

to fit within the short list of those functions to which

11

this Court has granted absolute immunity:

12

the judge's judicial or legislative capacity; jurors,

13

witnesses, and prosecutors taking part in a deliberative

14

evidentiary hearing; the President or legislators and

15

their aides acting as alter egos.

16
17

At this time, if the Court has no objection, I
would like to reserve time for rebuttal.

MR. FITE:

1

Addressing that question, I would

need — we think we need to take a look at the history of

3

judicial immunity.

4

judicial immunity afforded to the court reporter?

5

You say do we need, in a sense,

My interpretation of the case is — and this is

6

founded in common law, is that judicial immunity

7

essentially comes into play because we felt that judicial

8

immunity had to be, otherwise the process of making

9

decisions of the judicial process would be damaged, would

10

not function as we want it to function.

The question I

11

see here for the Court to resolve, is it necessary to

12

extend that immunity on to a court reporter to accomplish

13

the same goal, and that is an effective judicial process.

14

So you say do — do we need to extend it on, is

15

it a policy decision?

16

policy decision in this respect, as I think that is how

17

judicial immunity arrived.

18

couldn't have collateral attack, we wouldn't have finality

of judgments, wouldn't have an arbitrator that concluded

in the reading I've done on the history — and I think the

a record and have finality as to the factual issues of the

in fulfilling that role, and I think one of the

2

consequences is — is to make that court reporter's role,

3

that sensitive role of being assured that they are

4

recording what happened fairly, accurately, with no bias,

5

that — the fact that there could be qualified immunity,

6

questions of fact about that, I think would inhibit the

7

court reporter in fulfilling that role.
QUESTION:

8

9

Why is that?

It seems to me there

are two purposes to absolute immunity.

One is simply to

10

restrict what otherwise would be frequent lawsuits, so

11

that the judge or whoever it is won't have to be in court

12

all the time defending his or her actions.

13

is to be sure that in order to avoid lawsuits, the judge

14

or whoever it is does not — does not shrink from making

15

the tough calls, the tough decisions, the jury from

16

calling it the way the jury really saw it, or the judge

17

from coming out against somebody who is a — an habitual

18

litigant and would sue anybody in sight.

19

And the second

I don't see how the second of these reasons, at

20

least, applies to the court reporter.

21

maybe — maybe qualified immunity is enough to take care

22

of that.

The first may, but

6

There may be — I don't think it's the most

7

important reason for immunity, but I think there well

8

could be that a court reporter with this litigious counsel

9

on one side saying I hope you got that record right today

10

when he said no or she said no and yes — it may have an

intimidation effect on the ability to sit back in an

MR. FITE:

The perfect judge doesn't need a

reporter, if somebody could record —
QUESTION:

11

I thought your point, Mr. Fite, was

12

that if there are eight people talking at once she can

13

hear them all, but she doesn't have eight hands.

14

can't write everything down at once, and therefore she has

15

to make a judgment about which things of those that she

16

heard and can remember she can get on paper.

17

happens sometimes, a court reporter with about six lawyers

18

arguing at the same time, they can't get them all.

19

she must make a decision as among those, which one she's

20

going to put down.
MR. FITE:

21

She

I mean that

And

Well, there's another element to that

too.

I agree with Your Honor.

Another element is at

times the court reporter needs to intrude into the

process, needs to say stop, I didn't get it, I need to

have you stop here.

3

But even with that, what I think is the greatest

danger flowing from failure to provide absolute immunity

to a court reporter is that I think you create a question

defeating the purpose of judicial immunity.

Is there any reason to think, Mr.

that once the Supreme Court has spoken and every counsel

is going to have to consider — in representing their
