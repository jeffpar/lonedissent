ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM C. BRYSON

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11
12
13

MR. BRYSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether the double

14

jeopardy clause bars successive prosecutions for contempt

15

of court and substantive criminal offenses which are based

16

on the same underlying conduct.

17

Our position is that the double jeopardy clause

18

does not bar such successive prosecutions because crimes

19

such as assault with intent to kill or drug trafficking

20

are not the same offense as contempt of court.

21

Now, this case comes to the Court on certiorari

22

to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.

23

of the case briefly are as follows.

24

proceeded against under contempt of court proceedings for

25

violating court orders that prohibited them from engaging

The facts

Respondents were both

1

in certain criminal acts.

2

Respondent Dixon was barred by an order that was

3

part of a pretrial release condition that provided that he

4

should not commit any crimes, and Respondent Foster was

5

found to have violated a civil protection order which

6

provided that he must not assault, molest, or threaten his

7

wif e.

8

After they were both found in contempt for

9

violating those orders, they were prosecuted criminally

10

for, in Foster's case, assault with intent to kill, and

11

other assaults, and in Dixon's case for the drug

12

trafficking offense that formed the basis for his contempt

13

proceeding.

14

QUESTION:

Now, would the prosecutor in those

15

subsequent criminal proceedings prove anything that wasn't

16

already proved at the contempt hearings?

17

MR. BRYSON:

In these particular cases, no, the

18

prosecutor would not prove any additional facts.

19

conduct is the same.

22

QUESTION:

The

So literally it falls within at least

the language of Grady v. Corbin.
MR. BRYSON:

I think literally it probably does

23

fall within the language of the formulation that the Court

24

adopted in Grady.

25

part of our submission here -- that that formulation the

Now, I hasten to add -- this is a major

1

Court has already said in Felix was unduly broad and the

2

Court noted in Felix that that formulation should not be

3

followed to the limits of its language.

4

QUESTION:

Do you think that this Court in Menna

5

and in Colombo at least indicated that it thought perhaps

6

double jeopardy applied in contempt situations?

7

MR. BRYSON:

No, Your Honor, and let me move

8

directly to Menna and Colombo, because the Respondents

9

discuss Menna and Colombo in some detail - -

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BRYSON:

12

13

Yes.
And I think they are easily

distinguishable.
Both of those cases involved a New York - - a

14

sort of double header New York contempt statute.

There

15

was -- and if I can go into the details of those statutes,

16

it's important.

17

One of them was section 750 of the judiciary law

18

of New York, which was contempt, and provided that a court

19

could hold somebody in contempt for a variety of acts,

20

including refusal to comply with an order to testify.

21

There was another provision of New York law,

22

section 600 of the penal law that was in effect in those

23

days, which had almost exactly the same language, also

24

entitled contempt, and provided that courts could penalize

25

people for various things, including failure to testify in

response to a direct order of the court.
To the extent that there's any suggestion -- and
the Court in this case did not -- in -- excuse me, in
Colombo and Menna did not reach the underlying double
jeopardy questions, but to the extent that there's any
suggestion that there was merit to the underlying double
jeopardy claims, it was simply saying that you can't
prosecute somebody for contempt and then come back and say
well, we're going to prosecute you for contempt again,
when the two contempt proceedings have exactly the same
elements.
That case did not at all involve the situation
that we have here, where we have a contempt proceeding
which has elements A and B, and we have criminal acts
which are not part of contempt which have elements D, E,
and F.

The elements simply do not overlap in this setting

and that, in our view, makes all the difference.
Now - QUESTION:

Mr. Bryson, if I understand what

you're saying, the premise of what you're saying is this,
that criminal contempt does not have as its element, or as
an element, the commission of either one of the two crimes
which these respective parties committed.
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:

That's correct.
But it seems to me that that's really

1

not the point.

2

offense, if you will, of criminal contempt has elements of

3

other crimes, but whether the court order in this case has

4

as its -- whether violation of the court order in this

5

case required proof of a crime, and in fact the court

6

order in this case did forbid a crime and its violation

7

required the proof, so why isn't this like Harris v.

8

United States?

9

Isn't the point not whether the generic

MR. BRYSON:

Your Honor, because we don't think

10

that the offense in the sense that that term is used in

11

the double jeopardy clause is a violation of this

12

particular court order.

13
14
15

The offense is contempt of court.

Now, let me

give you an analogy - QUESTION:

Yes, but it's equally true that there

16

is no offense of contempt of court unless there is a court

17

order and the offense is confined to the elements of that

18

order, isn't that true?

19

MR. BRYSON:

Well, the Government certainly, or

20

the court, if the court is proceeding in the contempt

21

proceeding, has to prove that in fact that court order was

22

violated, but it is no different, Your Honor --

23

QUESTION:

Well, it does, but may I just ask

24

this -- and I realize I keep interrupting you.

25

I'll stop

1

MR. BRYSON:

2

QUESTION:

It's all right.
I promise you.

There is one

3

essential respect in which the offense of contempt of

4

court is different -- criminal contempt of court is

5

different from the normal crime, and that is, it has no

6

specific elements.

7

No one can be charged generically with contempt

8

of court.

One can only be charged with contempt for

9

violating a specific order, and therefore it seems to me

10

that any contempt analysis has got to include the specific

11

order that was violated, and if that includes the elements

12

of a crime, i.e. because it forbids the commission of any

13

crime, that is the datum that you look to to decide

14

whether you're talking about a Harris situation.

15
16
17

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I don't think so, Your Honor,

and let me give you an analogy that I think applies here.
Suppose the crime in question is failure to

18

follow a lawful order of a police officer.

19

incorporate, in effect, all possible human activity that

20

could be subject to a police officer's order as being

21

elements of that crime.

22

That would not

The crime is failing to follow an order of a

23

police officer, and if the order of a police officer is

24

don't shoot that man, it doesn't make murder a lesser

25

included offense, in effect, of the offense of failing to

follow a lawful order of a police officer.

It's the same

situation here.
QUESTION:

Well, it seems to me the trouble is

there that the --at least as generally understood, the
offense of failing to follow the order of an officer
refers to orders for the commission or the prohibition of
discretionary acts, not the incorporation by police
officers of the criminal law --of specific provisions of
the criminal law, so I don't think that analogy gets you
anywhere.
Do you agree with me that there is at least an
essential difference between the offense of criminal
contempt and the offense, let's say, of burglary, in the
sense that there are no specific elements of the offense
of criminal contempt?

You cannot charge a criminal

contempt without something more, i.e., a court order.

Do

you agree with that?
MR. BRYSON:

Well, I wouldn't put it that way.

No, I don't agree with that, Justice Souter.

The offense

of criminal contempt does have elements which is violation
of a court order.

Now, the --

QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

But you've got to have a court order.
Well, that's right, but in a false

statement offense you have to have a false statement.

The

offense is making a false statement, let's say within the

2

actually prove what the statement was and then show that

3

it was false.

4

The Government has to

That's no different, I think --

QUESTION:

But what it's proving in the criminal

5

contempt case is, if you will, the analog of the content

6

of the law, whereas in your example of the false

7

statement, what it is proving is the act which happened

8

also to be a violation of the law.

9

MR. BRYSON:

Well, Your Honor, I think it is --

10

when you go - - when you look at the elements of the

11

offense, which is what's critical here, the fact that

12

there is conduct, and really the conduct here is the

13

violation of the particular order, it's -- the facts of

14

the case are -- excuse me - - are the order of the Court

15

and the fact of the violation of that particular order,

16

that doesn't count in the way Blockburger looks at the

separate elements of an offense --

order and the particular violation of the order that's at

2

issue in the particular case, because otherwise you really

3

are looking at conduct.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. BRYSON:

6

QUESTION:

Mr. -You've adopted a same conduct test.
Mr. Bryson, so supposing someone, a

7

spectator during a jury trial in a trial court just gets

8

up and starts yelling, he can be held in contempt, can't

9

he, without showing that he violated any particular order

10

of the court?
MR. BRYSON:

11
12

13

He could, Your Honor, yes, that's

right.
Now, I think in response to Justice Souter's

14

question, Justice Souter is limiting the question, as I

15

understand it, to cases in which brands of contempt that

16

involve the violation of an order -- in other words,

17

contempts emerging from injunctions or other orders --

18

QUESTION:

In other words, you're not claiming

19

that if there had not been an order here saying don't

commit a crime, that he could have been held in

contempt -- criminal contempt of court if he had

22

committed --

Absolutely.

Now, what could the prosecutor have

MR. BRYSON:

1

2

Well, the two cases present

different options for the prosecutor.

3

In Dixon, in a sense the prosecutor has more

4

options because the prosecutor is more directly in control

5

of the situation.

6

went to the court and said, we would like a modification

7

of the terms of the bail release, and suggesting an

8

increase in the bond.

The court said no, I think this is

proceeding.
The court could also have simply revoked the

release of Dixon on the murder charge which he was - -

13

QUESTION:

So the court deprived the prosecutor,

14

possibly, of the option of going ahead with the criminal

15

charges if double jeopardy attaches.

16

MR. BRYSON:

That is the problem in this

17

setting, is that the court is in a position that it can

18

deprive the prosecutor of proceeding with the criminal

19

case.

20

Now, that problem is even more serious in the

21

Foster-type setting, because you've got two very important

22

interests at stake.

23

interest of the woman, typically, in - - who has the civil

24

protection order and who's being assaulted by her husband.

25

She wants immediate relief and is entitled to immediate

adjudication which may be the only way that she can get

3

the assaultive behavior to stop.

5

6

quick, effective relief, so she goes in for contempt, and

7

that's a very sympathetic situation in which to grant

8

contempt.

9

It doesn't work.

She needs

But it may well be that the prosecutor is not in

10

a position at that point to go forward with criminal

11

charges, or it may well be that the prosecutor doesn't

12

even have notice that she's proceeding on the contempt

13

angle and therefore if Dixon and Foster is correct -- the

14

decision below in Dixon and Foster is correct, the

15

prosecutor will be foreclosed from bringing very serious

16

criminal charges in a situation in which the defendant is

17

subject to no more than 6 months imprisonment under the

18

family court contempt proceedings that are at issue here.

19

Now, of course, there's another general contempt

20

statute in the District of Columbia which was not invoked

21

here which provides for longer contempt incarceration, but

22

6 months is the limit that someone in Foster's position

23

was exposed to, even though the conduct he engaged in was

24

much more serious than a 6-month sentence would suggest.

3

But there's an even greater danger, let me point

out, of an acquittal in the following setting.

5

what you've got is a Foster-type situation in which the

contempt proceeds first, and the basis for the contempt is

an attempted murder by Foster against his wife, and the

judge acquits Foster not on the ground that the murder

didn't take place or that Foster didn't commit the murder,

Suppose

10

but on the ground that Foster didn't have notice of the

11

order.

12

In that situation, if this -- if the lower court

3

decision is right in this case, and these are the same

4

offense, then we would not be able to proceed with the

5

attempted murder charge in the criminal case because the

6

offense would already have been prosecuted, even though --

2

offense has been the same, and therefore presumably the

3

analysis of whether it's the same offense as a substantive

4

crime would have stayed the same.

5

Now, the Court in Grady changed all this, at

6

least as perceived by the lower courts, with the

7

formulation that the Court adopted in Grady, which was the

8

formulation that this Court talked about in Felix, that to

9

establish an essential element of an offense charged in

10

the second prosecution, the State will prove conduct that

11

constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already

12

been prosecuted.

appear to cover this case, but that is an extremely broad

formulation which has proved very difficult to apply.

1

the context in which Grady arose and because of

2

difficulties that have already arisen in its

3

interpretation.

4

The context of Grady was a lesser-included

5

offense context, or, as the Court expressed it, if not

6

technically a lesser-included offense, at least a species

7

of lesser-included offense.
In Grady and in Vitale before it, the reckless

driving by or traffic infractions that were the first

prosecuted provided a basis on which you could infer at

11

least either the establishment of recklessness, the

12

element of the greater offense, or at least go a long way

13

to establishing that.

14

As we've argued here, it's very different in

15

contempt, because without knowing a fact of the case, the

16

fact of what's in the court order, the violation -- a

17

violation such as assault with intent to kill or drug

Mr. Klein,

1

2

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

3

The United States wants to prosecute Mr. Dixon

4

and Mr. Foster for breaking the law after they have

5

already been prosecuted for breaking these same laws in

6

violation of court orders.

7

with respect to the application of the double jeopardy

8

clause in these circumstances.

9

I have three points to cover

First, if we could set aside just for a moment

10

the special features of contempt, I think it would be

11

clear that further prosecution here violates the double

12

jeopardy clause under pre-Grady principles, and we think

13

that the controlling principles are those in Harris and

14

actually with respect to Dixon the principles of Brown v.

15

Ohio.

16

As a matter of law, the offenses now being

17

prosecuted were component offenses or elements of the

18

offenses that were prosecuted first, so we don't think the

19

Court needs to talk about conduct at all.

20

facial examination of the applicable laws takes this Court

21

to the principles of Harris or Brown.

22

My second point would be that there should be no

23

change in the Court's general rule that a comprehensive

offense and a component offense are the same offense for

double jeopardy purposes simply -27

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Well, it is an ambiguous question, at

which side of the fence you're looking at at trial.
MR. KLEIN:

That's right.

I think that one of

20

these cases, Foster, could be decided under the principles

21

of Brown, that the crimes now being prosecuted constitute

22

elements of the crimes previously prosecuted, and in

23

Dixon, where the Court's order was, it is a crime to

24

commit any crime, that that is comparable to the

25

relationship of the two laws in Harris v. Oklahoma which

was the felony murder statute.
And I think that the comparison - - and this is
really very important, and I think this is why Grady
really isn't needed to decide the relationship in this
case, is that we can make that comparison between the
definition of the offenses being prosecuted simply by a
facial examination of the laws, one a judge-made law, of
course, that being the contempt, and the other a statutory
law, but we don't have to ask about conduct or what the
prosecutor's theory of the case was.
QUESTION:

Well, does your position mean that

any time a criminal defendant having been convicted and
let's say placed on probation on typical terms, which is
that you be law-abiding, and then the probationer is
brought in back to the sentencing court because of
committing some criminal offense, not remaining lawabiding, and so the probation is revoked.
Now, would you say double jeopardy prevents any
subsequent prosecution there as well?
MR. KLEIN:

Absolutely not, Your Honor, because

Well, why is Foster's prosecution
The U.S. Attorney wasn't involved in

MR. KLEIN:

Because this Court has said

repeatedly in Young v. -- excuse me, in the Providence
Journal case, and in the Young case, that a criminal
contempt prosecution, regardless of who actually handles
the prosecution, is a criminal prosecution on behalf of
the sovereign.
And in fact we think that - - and that was said
twice, and in fact that goes back to Gompers, 50 or 60
years before, that a criminal contempt prosecution is
between the public and the defendant and it is not part of
the underlying civil proceeding, which is what there was
in Foster, and that it is a -- that the criminal contempt
is a crime in the ordinary sense, regardless of who
prosecutes it, and we think that the answer, Your Honor,

Mrs. Foster went

Well, no one has doubted in this

7

litigation to this point, and I didn't hear the Government

8

doubt it this morning, that that was in fact a criminal

9

prosecution, a criminal contempt prosecution.
The judge at Mr. Foster's trial said it was a

10

11

criminal prosecution.

He said that the Government --

12

excuse me, he said that the attorney there, who was

3

representing the Government, would have to prove the

4

contempt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the sentence that

5

was imposed was a determinate sentence, which is as I read

6

this Court's jurisprudence always of tremendous importance

7

in deciding whether the proceeding is remedial and civil

8

or punitive and -- not punitive, but criminal, because the

9

sentence is to punish for the affront to the court's

20
21

dignity.
And I think that that's really the critical

22

point here, which is that the sole purpose of the criminal

contempt is to vindicate the authority of the court and

not to protect private litigants, and -- for the

vindicated by revoking the pretrial release for the

commission of the crime, whereas in Foster there doesn't

MR. KLEIN:

6

Well, I think that one might be able

to say that if we were back at the earlier stage and

asking the question whether the court should go ahead and

punish for contempt, there would arguably be greater

necessity in the one in Foster than in the other, but in

11

That is not a slogan.

It's anything but a

slogan.

first the Court's sense that, unless the contempt power is

tightly tethered to the Bill of Rights, it is

inconceivable that the exercise of that power can be

restricted to the least power necessary.

contempt was considered something quite separate from

2

criminal prosecution originally and that it's changed with

3

4

as a criminal prosecution for all purposes?

5

We faced that question a few years ago and

decided, for example, that the court can appoint its own

prosecutor for contempt, thus raising the problem that the

Government poses in this case -- the prosecutor doesn't

10

So we are inevitably confronted with the

question, having decided that contrary to what the common

law tradition had been we're going to treat contempt as a

13

criminal matter, are we going to treat is a criminal

14

matter for all purposes?

Now, we certainly haven't treated it as a

The necessity is that the Court can

be imposing a slap on the wrist for contempt and depriving

5

the prosecutor of the ability on behalf of the people to

7

MR. KLEIN:

I disagree.

I think that the

8

Government greatly misreads Young and the import of the

9

decision in Young.

10

11

Young puts the prosecutor in the

driver's seat.
Young says, at least in the Federal courts --

12

and any other jurisdiction now has a model that it could

3

follow -- Young says these prosecutions must be referred

4

in the first instance to the public prosecutor, and then

5

the prosecutor can control the timing of when the contempt

MR. KLEIN:

MR. KLEIN:

The whole issue has arisen only twice that we know of in

6

courts came out in our favor.

7

These cases are really sort of oddball cases.

So there is apparently no Federal practice, no

criminal rather than civil contempt remedy, it wouldn't

have been any answer to the concern of the court - - the

legitimate concern of the court for the prosecutor to say,

5

well, I'll bring in information and we'll put this down on

6

the trial calendar and I will include a contempt count as

7

well as a substantive assault count.

8

I don't know how many weeks or months would go

9

by in the District of Columbia, but the fact is, if that

10

were the procedure the trial court would be left with no

11

immediate means to -- in effect to vindicate its order and

12

no immediate means to have an effective order.

3
4

Isn't that

fair to say?
MR. KLEIN:

That's true.

The court could not

achieve immediacy, but I think this Court has already come

to the conclusion that if a contempt does not occur in the

courtroom, then immediacy is not an essential part of the

QUESTION:

of applying that kind of a rationale in this situation

that the possibility of enforcing these kinds of domestic

legitimate interest in addition to the general public

13

MR. KLEIN:

Right, and I think, Your Honor, that

14

the courts should in these instances put pressure on the

Government to bring any substantive criminal prosecution

swiftly, and the question is, does the court's interest

QUESTION:

So the only distinctive

characteristic is the dignity of the court somehow.
MR. KLEIN:

I agree, the question referred to

that as the rhetoric of the court's decision, and if there
was a concern there, I wanted to deal with it.
Justice O'Connor, I think you were given some
inadvertently slightly wrong information in response to
one of your questions.
In the Dixon case, the prosecutor moved to
modify Dixon's pretrial release, and he cited in his
motion the indictment, and he came before the court and
they started the proceeding.
At some point the judge said, I don't think that
I would have a basis to modify his bail if my concern is
flight, and then the judge said to the prosecutor -- and
this is critical to the facts - - are you seeking
preventive detention, and the relevant provision is in our
brief.

It's D.C. Code Section 23-1329(c).
That would have allowed for the preventive

detention of Dixon on the showing that he had violated a
condition of his release.

There would have been a lesser

showing than was needed to prove the contempt.

there's a time limit with respect to this particular

That's unusual, because at least in

Federal law it's been very much circumscribed.

12

MR. KLEIN:

But Your Honor, there wouldn't have

been a problem here anyway, because the Government already

had the indictment in hand, so in terms of joining

15

everything together, the prosecutor could simply have

said, Your Honor, I don't know that I want to go ahead

17

with a criminal contempt prosecution, but if that's what

18

we're going to do, let's proceed on the indictment, and

19

they could have done it all together.

20

I agree that Foster looks somewhat different.

21

If there's going to be a system, if the States are going

Court said, the cases should be referred to the public

need to have some very specific and strong remedy.

what contempt is for, and that's why it is so important to

23

not water down the effect of contempt in this setting, and

I would add one other point.

for a minute?
What do you say to the suggestion that criminal

2

3

contempt can be charged, preventive detention can be

4

imposed in the Foster situation, and prosecution can take

5

place subsequently in the normal course, so that as a

6

practical matter you get the offender away from the

7

victim?
MR. BRYSON:

8

9

Well, contempt can clearly be

charged, but in many States preventive detention is not

10

available for offenses such as simple assault, and in fact

11

I don't believe -QUESTION:

12

If that is so, isn't that the problem

13

of the State, not the problem of the double jeopardy

14

clause?

15

MR. BRYSON:

Well, I'm not sure the solution to

16

the current problem is to get around the problem by

17

creating the capacity for preventive detention for minor

18

offenses and then using it for long periods of time, such

19

as 6 months.

20

I think that's really using preventive detention

21

to serve a purpose to get around the problem, that you

22

really are holding him in contempt but you're calling it

23

preventive detention and thereby avoiding the double

24

jeopardy clause.

25

satisfactory result, jurisprudentially.

I don't think that's really a

QUESTION:

Yes, but to the extent that you're

concerned that you need to make the contempt proceedings
officially serious, is there any limit on the court's
power to impose the same punishment they would impose they
would impose in a criminal prosecution?
MR. BRYSON:

If the court has a statute, a

general contempt statute that has no limit on the amount
of time that can be made the sentence, that's right, there
would be no restriction.
But typically in these situations, that's not
the case, and here the statute under which the proceeding
was brought, the contempt statute in this particular case,
had a limit of only 6 months to it -- at least, the
proceeding under the Intrafamily Act.
QUESTION:

Yes, but there can be more than one

6 months consecutively, can't it be?
MR. BRYSON:
QUESTION:
MR. BRYSON:

For various acts, that's right.
Yes.

Yes.

And to be sure, to acknowledge the

point made by respondents, there is a separate contempt
statute in the District of Columbia that could conceivably
have been invoked but was not in this case.
If the Court has nothing further, thank you.
