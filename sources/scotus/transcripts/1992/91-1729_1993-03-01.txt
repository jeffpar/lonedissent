ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUNGAR:

8

9

We'll hear argument

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case involves the question whether the

10

11

United States retains its long-standing common law right

12

to collect prejudgment interest on debts owed by state and

13

local governments.

14

Federal Food Stamp Program.

16

issuance to eligible individuals.

17

choose to distribute food stamps through the mail are

18

contractually liable to the United States for a portion of

19

the value of the food stamps that are lost or stolen in

20

the mail.

21

The case arises in the context of the
Under that program the United

States like Texas that

In 1986 and 1987 the United States asserted

22

claims against Texas amounting to over $400,000 for losses

23

arising out of the State's issuance of food stamps in the

24

mail.

25

upheld the validity of those claims, but the court of

1

appeals also held that the United States was not entitled

2

to collect prejudgment interest on the State's debts.

3

submit that the court of appeals erred in reaching that

4

conclusion.

We

As this Court has repeatedly indicated, an award

5
6

of prejudgment interest is in keeping with fundamental

7

principles of fairness and equity and serves to insure

8

that neither party to a dispute benefits or suffers from a

9

delay in payment.

For those reasons the right of the

10

United States to collect prejudgment interest from the

11

states and from local governments has long been recognized

12

as a matter of Federal common law.

13

Respondents argue that Congress intentionally

14

abrogated that long-standing common law right when it

15

enacted the Debt Collection Act of 1982, but the language

16

and purpose of that act and traditional canons of

17

statutory construction require rejection of respondents'

18

argument.

19

not address the question at issue in this case.

20

says only that states are not persons for purposes of the

21

mandatory prejudgment interest and delinquency penalty

22

provisions of 31 U.S.C. section 3717.

The language of the Debt Collection Act does
The act

23

Standing alone, that exclusion from the scope of

24

section 3717 does not suggest that Congress intended to go

25

further and to abrogate the existing common law remedy.

1

The common law remedy is discretionary and flexible and

2

allows courts to weigh the interests of the state better

3

in determining whether and to what extent to award

4

prejudgment interest.

5

QUESTION:

If the state had just refused to pay,

6

Mr. Hungar, and the United States had sued the state,

7

which was not the case here, would it have had a choice to

8

proceed under the Federal common law or under the Debt

9

Collection Act, or does the Debt Collection Act not

10
11

provide some substantial cause of action?
MR. HUNGAR:

In this case the United States

12

would not have had the choice to proceed under the Debt

13

Collection Act because the Debt Collection Act's

14

prejudgment interest remedy expressly excludes the states.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

I mean for the substantive amount

owed, for the principal amount owed.
MR. HUNGAR:

Well, the Debt Collection Act

18

doesn't create a cause of action.

19

certain remedies and certain specific contexts for the

20

Federal Government's debt collection efforts.

21

even a comprehensive scheme in that respect.

22

QUESTION:

It just, it sets forth

It's not

All right, so there's no substantive

23

liability under -- substantive cause of action created

24

under the Debt Collection Act?

25

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, where the -- that's correct.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. HUNGAR:

3
4

For the principal sum.
That's correct, Your Honor.

The

substantive cause of action comes from the Food Stamp Act.
QUESTION:

Would the -- and is that the common

5

law cause of action that the United States would proceed

6

under in this hypothetical case where the United States is

7

initiating the suit?

8

choice to say well, we'll proceed under the statutory

9

cause of action or under the Federal common law, or are

10
11

Would the United States then have a

they the same thing?
MR. HUNGAR:

Well,

if we're referring to the

12

Federal common,

13

different question than the remedy for prejudgment

14

interest in our view,

15

United States would have a cause of action that could

16

either be viewed as an implied right of action under the

17

Food Stamp Act or as the more general Federal cause of

18

action for money had and received, which is at issue in

19

the United States against California case.

20

the Federal cause of action, which is a

the cause of action - - I am sure the

But in either event we would submit that

21

prejudgment interest would be available under the separate

22

remedial rule that this Court has repeatedly affirmed,

23

which is that where a sum of money is owing to the United

24

States prejudgment interest is generally available,

25

depending on the equities of the particular situation.

QUESTION:

1

So if in the hypothetical case you

2

had proceeded under the statutory authority to collect the

3

money, the Debt Collection Act is still not applicable

4

insofar as prejudgment interest is concerned?

5

MR. HUNGAR:

In this context, yes, Your Honor,

6

because this would be an action against a state and states

7

are excluded from the scope of section 3717.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

Mr. Hungar, in cases in which the

common law remedy is applied, when does the interest run
from?

Is it the date of the complaint?
MR. HUNGAR:

11

Again, Your Honor, because the

12

common law remedy is flexible and discretionary, that is

13

up to the court.

14
15

QUESTION:

Could the court assess it as of a

date earlier than the date of the complaint?
MR. HUNGAR:

16

We believe it could, Your Honor,

17

but it might, depending on the equities of the particular

18

situation, if there had been some undue delay perhaps then

19

it would be inequitable to impose liability prior to that

20

date.

21

complaint would be the first date from which interest

22

would accrue.

23

would be that interest begins accruing once the debt is

24

liquidated and owing.

25

The court could determine that the date of the

I would think the general rule, though,

Now, there's no discretion under the

MR. HUNGAR:

it would have had under the act.

11

of remedy, I take it.

12

MR. HUNGAR:

It's not the same kind

That's exactly right, Your Honor.

3

The common law remedy is quite distinct and different from

4

the statutory remedy.

5

It requires courts to impose prejudgment interest at a

6

specified mandatory minimum statutory rate, which is not

7

true of the common law.

8

processing fees and delinquency penalties in appropriate

9

cases, which is not true of the common law.

The statutory remedy is mandatory.

It requires collection of

It applies to

20

more debts or more obligations than does the common law

remedy.

22

that the statute is mandatory on the courts, the common

23

law has discretion.

24

QUESTION:

25

And the biggest distinction is the fact of course

Do you see the common law remedy as

essentially a discretionary judicial remedy as distinct

from something which is implicit in a contractual

2

relationship?

3

remedy.

4

I assume the answer is yes, it's a judicial

There's nothing contractual about it.
MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

5

think prejudgment, although this case doesn't present that

6

question, I think that prejudgment interest could be

7

available under the common law even beyond a purely

8

contractual relationship if it were appropriate.

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Hungar -- I'm sorry.

10

QUESTION:

If you're correct, Mr. Hungar, and

11

there still exists this common law right to recover

12

prejudgment interest, are any of the State's other

13

arguments open for consideration on remand?

14

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, the State has argued in this

15

Court that the plain statement rule announced by this

16

Court in Pennhurst would bar application of prejudgment

17

interest.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I think they have also made

19

arguments that go to, that are equitable in nature, I

20

suppose, the fact that the Government's own agent stole

21

food stamps and things of that sort.

22

MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct, Your Honor.

To the

23

extent the State is arguing that even if prejudgment

24

interest is appropriate an award of prejudgment interest

25

should not be awarded in this case, and it's not clear to

what extent the State is making that argument, but

2

certainly to the extent the State is making that argument

3

that would be a valid consideration on remand in

determining whether prejudgment interest is available.

5

The legislative history of the act - -

QUESTION:

7

Mr. Hungar, before you get to the

legislative•history --

8

(Laughter.)

9

QUESTION:

-- I suppose the best argument for

10

the other side, it's really a sort of inclusio unius est

11

exclusio alterius argument, and why doesn't it make a lot

12

of sense?

13

the Government would want to establish these new rules

14

that are apparently fairer and more efficient for all

15

other interests but somehow not for interests owing by the

16

states?

17

simply saying no interest from the states, you just don't

18

get it, and where you get interest these are the fair and

19

efficient rules for getting it.

20

MR. HUNGAR:

Why, can you explain to us why it would, why

It seems to me much more likely that they were

Well, I'm sure that the private

21

debtors who have now been subjected to section 3717 would

22

disagree with your characterization that section 3717 is

23

fairer than the common law.

equitable defenses could be considered.

QUESTION:

MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct, but the

Government - QUESTION:

You don't mean Congress passed this

not thinking it was fair?
MR. HUNGAR:

Congress was attempting to enhance

11

the Federal Government's abilities to collect debts as

12

against those entities covered by the act, but Congress

13

could well have determined that it would be inappropriate,

14

for example, to impose on state and local governments the

15

delinquency penalties and the processing fees that are

16

mandated by section 3717 in addition to the statutory

17

minimum rate of interest.

18

Congress could also well have determined that it

19

would be appropriate to leave state and local governments

20

subject to the flexible common law remedy under which the

21

courts are permitted to weigh the interests of the state

22

debtor in determining whether in the particular case an

23

award of interest is appropriate.

possible under the statute, so it's entirely conceivable

25

that Congress wanted to leave the states subject to the

provisions of section 3717.

5

odd and round about way to achieve a formal, an

6

affirmative abrogation of the existing law simply to

7

exclude state and local governments from the scope of a

non-comprehensive limited statute, which is what the Debt

Collection Act was.

It's sort of an

scheme designed to answer all questions that might arise

12

with respect to the Government's debt collection efforts.

debt collection efforts.

Well, I'm not sure whether it would

be denominated to cause of action, but it certainly

mandates that a prejudgment interest remedy in the context

6

the existence or non-existence of a prejudgment interest

7

remedy in the context of state debtors.

8

least the statutory language is equally susceptible to

9

interpretation.

But at the very

Even if it's equally reasonable, which we

10

think it's not, to read the statute in the way that the

11

State does, it's certainly reasonable to read it in the

12

way we do.

13

If Congress had in fact intended to leave the

14

law with respect to the states alone, a perfectly

15

reasonable and rational way of achieving that result is to

16

say this statute doesn't apply to the states, because the

17

general presumption in all areas is, and specifically when

18

we're talking about the common law, is that when Congress

19

doesn't legislate with respect to that particular question

20

it leaves the state of the law as it was.

21

we're saying happened in this case.

22

And that's all

The legislative history of the act provides no

23

support for a contrary conclusion.

24

noted, that Congress expressly stated in its statutory

preamble that the purpose of the act was to provide

collecting its debts.

construe a statute intended to assist the Federal

4

Government and enhance its debt collection efforts in a

5

manner that would cut back on existing remedies against a

certain class of debtors.

13

though it was focused on a different set of problems it

nonetheless went out of its way and intended to abrogate

No, Your Honor, because Congress is

understood to legislate against the backdrop of

those traditional canons is that Congress will not be

deemed to have changed the law and in particular will not

MR. HUNGAR:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes .
I mean, you have said that.

That has

been your argument here.
MR. HUNGAR:

4

That's correct,

Your Honor.

In any

5

event,

deference to the administrative construction of the

6

statute is appropriate because the question here is not

7

whether prejudgment interest is appropriate in this case

8

or whether the common law prejudgment interest remedy

9

exists.

Those are questions for the court.

The question

10

here is whether Congress,

in enacting the Debt Collection

Act of 1982,

12

the existing common law remedy.

13

that the administrative agency has determined in our

14

favor,

evidenced a congressional intent to abrogate

and we believe that is what is due deference.

17

at the rate of 8 percent from the time they got notice of

the debt?

we're going to follow the common law,

interest or the time?

Before 1982 there

3702, and as Mr. Hungar just mentioned, 3714, were in that

preexisting.

13

expand the scope and really limit the discretion.

the most important things it did was to reduce the

11

that's based on regulation 102.11.

12

102.13, which is the one Mr. Hungar was discussing.

102.13 incorporates almost verbatim the provisions of

Agriculture treated the Texas Department of Human Services

effect of allowing this putative common law right is to

QUESTION:

So states are not out

Well, if the state had refused to pay

have a choice to say we're proceeding under the common law

or we're proceeding under the statute?

the choice make any difference so far as the Debt

17

Collection Act?

18

MR. TODD:

And if so would

The answer to the first question is I

19

don't think that the Federal Government's choice would be

20

to proceed under common law.

21

proceed under the specific enforcement provision of the

22

statute, and for the reasons that I want to discuss in

23

detail as to how a statute displaces common law.

2

it can use which hasn't really been a subject of this

litigation thus far.
I think the City of Milwaukee v. Illinois case

5

in '81, and it sort of was a companion case to

6

Northwestern Airlines v. National Transport Union, are two

7

cases which'really clarify and remind litigants of the

8

proper scope of Federal common law when there has been a

9

particular statute.

And I think that's a good starting

10

point for analysis to then take a look and see what the

11

Debt Collection Act has done.
That case reminded litigants that Federal common

12

13

law is not like the common law, the body of common law

14

that the state courts by and large have developed.

15

called common law because judges use a common law type of

16

decision making process, but it's a limited stop gap

17

measure.

18

Federal court needs to make a decision on a question,

19

there is no Federal statute to guide it, and it's not

appropriate to look to state common law.

22

common law.

for Congress to directly address a question.

goes on again, this is really a reminder of what had been

the law all along.

this statute we intend to displace Federal common law.

6

fact in none of the briefs in this case, in none of the

another helpful case is United States v. Fausto, said you

3

scope and the structure of its remedial scheme.
Now as to the purpose, obviously 3701(c) is an

5

exception.

It is an exception, so in a sense you can say

6

any time a statute makes an exception, having made a broad

7

across the board rule, any time it comes back and says but

8

we except, we exclude these categories, you can say that's

9

contrary to the purpose, but it isn't really in this case.

10

It's not at all unusual for Congress to choose to treat

11

one class of debtors differently, governmental parties

12

differently from others.

debtors differently from other debtors.

19

very common to find that governments don't have to pay

interest.

unique sort of relationship which state agencies have with

I would agree that that's an instance

in which a governmental entity does not pay interest and

7

somebody back in which there has been an overpayment.

8

this is sort of that sort of situation.

9

Stamps Act what the Government is saying is that money has

10

been paid which the Government should not have had to pay,

11

and therefore the State of Texas should refund or

12

reimburse the Federal Government a portion of that money

13

which the Federal Government should not have had to pay.

14

And so it's a similar sort of situation.

judicial doctrines, then a court can and should substitute

its judgment for the agency.

indication of it is in the Government's brief.

it's extremely unclear, and furthermore that this is an

suggesting is actually the situation where the statute has

I mean, the Government has to bill you

MR. TODD:

That would be the way it would, if

they have to have, if they have to charge interest I would

say that, as I was saying earlier, the one thing that

distinguishes the relationship of the Federal recipient

creditor-debtor relations is this ongoing relationship

10

that they have and the need that they have to maintain

good relations with the -- the states are simply not

some part of the problem, but they're not a big problem.

MR. TODD:

Not explicitly.

From United States

States brought it, the United States through the Bureau of

That was

10

Indian Affairs was really bringing it on behalf of a

11

native American, and really the outcome of that case was

12

based on the fact that really the United States

13

Government's position there was equivalent to any other

14

individual who was due a tax refund.

15

16

the Federal Government can sue a county, and although they

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. HUNGAR:

The State's burden in this case is

to show that a statute expressly intended to enhance the

10

Federal Government's debt collection efforts.

11

had the effect of creating an unprecedented disincentive

12

for an important class of debtors to pay --

QUESTION:

In fact it

May I ask you if there was a case

other than the one that your opponent mentioned before
