v. Catholic Social Services.

Mr. Mann, you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. MANN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

10

This case arises out of the provisions of the

11

Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 that granted

12

amnesty to certain longstanding illegal aliens.

13

presents two class actions challenging regulations the

14

attorney general promulgated to interpret eligibility

15

requirements under the act.

16

The case

In one case a regulation interpreting a proviso

17

that allowed an alien to gain relief even if he had brief,

18

casual, and innocent absences from the United States, in

19

the other a regulation interpreting the requirement that

20

the aliens' immigration status have been continuously

21

unlawful since 1982.

22

In each case a class of aliens filed suit in a

23

Federal district court in California and secured a ruling

24

holding the challenged regulations invalid.

25

district courts then proceeded to require INS to grant the

Both of the

1

benefit of the ruling not only to aliens who filed

2

applications before the program expired, but also to

3

aliens who applied after the deadline in May 1988.

4

The Government appealed and the Ninth Circuit

5

affirmed.

6

case has been pending and INS has been obligated to

7

continue accepting applications for the more than 4-1/2

years since May 1988.

Those orders have continued in effect while the

It has accepted about 300,000 so

In our view the decision of the court of appeals

10
11

is wrong for two separate reasons.

12

court did not have jurisdiction to review INS

13

determinations regarding whether or not members of the

14

respondent class were eligible for relief under the act.

15

And second, even if it did have jurisdiction it was

16

improper for the district courts to grant relief to aliens

17

who failed to apply before the program expired in May of

18

1988.

First, the district

On the first question the key factor is the

final order of deportation.
Thus although the statute allowed aliens to seek

2

3

relief from the agency while retaining their

4

confidentiality and anonymity, they could not obtain

5

judicial review of an adverse agency decision without

6

giving up their fugitive status, either by surrendering --

7

QUESTION:

Well, now did the -- did INS, in your

8

view, have authority to determine that the regulations

9

were invalid in a -- in an ordinary proceeding brought by

10
11
12

an alien?
MR. MANN:

No.

INS is bound by regulations that

are issued by the attorney general.

13

QUESTION:

Right.

14

MR. MANN:

And so if an alien had filed an

15

application for relief, and many aliens in this situation

16

did, the application would have been denied and

17

undoubtedly the denial would have been affirmed by the

18

legalization appeals unit if the regulation remained valid

19

at the time the appeal was taken.

20

withdrawn before the -- just before the application period

21

expired, so some of the adjudications would not yet have

22

been determined by the legalization appeals unit.

23

what that would do is that would place that alien in

24

exactly the same situation as any alien whose application

25

was denied.

The regulations were

But

For example, if the INS determined as a fact

1
2

that the alien first entered the United States in 1983 his

3

application would be denied.

4

the evidence in the record supported that, would deny

5

the -- would deny the appeal and the alien could do

6

nothing.

7

The LAU, if it agreed that

If the alien wanted to challenge that, he would

8

have to give himself up and submit to our immigration laws

9

and then challenge it in the court of appeals after

10
11

deportation proceedings.
QUESTION:

Well, didn't we have a virtually

12

identical provision before us in McNary against the

13

Haitian refugees?

14

MR. MANN:

Yes, in -- in -- in the relevant

15

respects we believe the jurisdictional provisions in

16

McNary were the same as these, and the difference is that

17

this case involves a different type of claim.

18

at issue in McNary were claims that could not have been

19

reviewed in the court of appeals on the administrative

20

record, but the fundamental claim was that INS was

21

deciding -- denying applications on the basis of evidence

22

that was not in the record.

23

The claims

And so if the court of appeals had reviewed the

24

administrative record it could not have ascertained

25

whether or not the claim was correct and would not have

1

been able to evaluate it.

And if that was the only remedy

2

that the aliens had, they really would not have had

3

effective judicial review.

4

By contrast, the claims here are that INS would

5

have improperly denied applications for legalization, and

6

the only thing that the court of appeals needs to know to

7

evaluate that claim is the core information that's

8

required to determine whether he's statutorily eligible.

9

And that information would be in the administrative

10

record.

That's the information that's put on the form

11

1-687, the application that the alien files.
He would file the application.

12

It would be

13

denied, probably denied by the LAU.

14

would have that application and it would be perfectly

15

capable of making its own decision as to whether or not

16

those facts were sufficient to justify relief under the

17

act.
QUESTION:

18

The court of appeals

Well, I guess the operative language

19

in section 1255 (a)(f) is a determination respecting an

20

application.

21

MR. MANN:

Yes, ma'am.

22

QUESTION:

And it certainly is arguable, anyway,

23

that that means a determination that the INS itself could

24

make.

25

MR. MANN:

That's correct, and in our view the

3

certain things had to be true for an alien to be entitled

to relief.

5

a member of the respondent class because the only claim

6

that the respondents can make is that if they filed an

7

application it would have been denied, or that they did

8

file an application and that they expected that it would

9

be denied.

10

INS determined that

The determination relates to an application of

So because they're challenging its effect on

11

them it's a determination respecting each of their

12

individual applications, and that's how we read the

13

statutory language to apply.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, is there a - - is there a

15

different problem with impossibility as a result of the

16

INS's practice -- I think it was called front desking,

17

that is to say simply not accepting the applications of

18

those that they were satisfied under the regs would fail?

19

So that as a matter fact, given the front desking

20

procedure, there is - - there was no way that a given

21

applicant could get his application to the point of a

22

final determination, subject to review.

23

MR. MANN:

Now that goes to the second question,

24

the remedial question, but --

25

QUESTION:

It does go to that.

MR. MANN:

Yes.

2

QUESTION:

Doesn't it also go to the question of

3

the appropriateness of applying McNary here on - - in

4

effect on an impossibility of review theory otherwise?
MR. MANN:

5

No, we don't really think it does.

6

In our view the jurisdictional question is -- this case

7

was filed in November of 1986 several months before the

8

application period started.

9

presented with a complaint and the question is whether it

10

The district court is

has jurisdiction over that complaint.
Now, at that time there were 18 months, more or

11
12

less, maybe 17 months left before the application period

13

was going to expire.

14

way that the district court could have determined at that

15

time that there was no way these people could file,

16

particularly if you look at the - - so I don't think that's

17

really relevant to the jurisdictional question.

18

And we don't think that there's any

The jurisdictional question, it seems to me,

19

turns on whether this is a - - whether the determination

20

they challenged, which is the regulation, is a

21

determination respecting an application in light of the

22

way that this Court interpreted that phrase in McNary.

McNary what if the -- what if the -- what if the action in

2

this case had been filed after the 1-year period began and

3

the period -- and the practice of front desking was known

4

and, in fact, was -- was pleaded, would that affect the

5

appropriateness of a McNary kind of jurisdictional

6

determination?

7

MR. MANN:

Well if you're -- if you're filing a

8

suit challenging INS's practices of accepting

9

applications -- for example, if the complaint isn't that

10

INS has an improper regulation for determining whether you

11

are eligible for relief, but instead that INS -- INS

12

officers are refusing to accept applications, it seems to

13

me that that is a - - that is a type of claim that arguably

14

might be covered by McNary, but that's not the claim

15

that's before the Court in this case.

16

The only people with respect to whom INS

17

appealed in this case are people who did not apply for

18

relief under the act.

19

look in the record you can see where the district courts

20

defined the groups to whom they extended relief.

21

didn't appeal with respect to the people who applied for

relief.

which, as we mentioned in our reply brief, would have

violated INS's policies as set forth in the legalization

manual -- if you did that, we believe that you have, in

QUESTION:

MR. MANN:

And it's our view that if you walk

into INS's offices and you attempt to apply, it's one

thing if they say we don't think you're going to get

relief and so you shouldn't waste the money.

On the second question, which is what

21

I was talking about with Justice Souter, whether or not it

22

was proper for the district courts to accept jurisdiction

23

over these cases in the first place, it certainly was

24

improper for them to grant relief to individuals who did

not satisfy the requirements for relief that Congress

The first of the four statutory requirements for

requirement is that the alien have filed an application

MR. MANN:

It does not expressly say that, but

it's our view - -

It's a negative application.

MR. MANN:

-- That the only -- the only basis

definition, people who are illegally here.

MR. MANN:

12

I don't -- I don't think the attorney

general views it that way.

basis that the attorney general has for allowing these

people to have any lawful status in this country is if

they meet each of the four requirements in 1255a(a).

precedent in later cases.

instead of by regulation?
MR. MANN:

Could it have done it that way

Yes, we think he could have.

I

would -- I would say the attorney general was obligated

under section 1255 (a)(g) to implement -- to pass

11

regulations and he did that before the application period

12

commenced.

arise and it will raise legal questions that are not

included in the regulations and had been decided in

the statute did not cover it.

whether the statute covers it or not, on the -- on the

respondents' theory, depends upon whether it was adopted

by rule or by adjudication.

MR. MANN:

1

I believe that respondents would

2

probably take the same position even if this was adopted

3

by a legalization appeals unit decision.

4
5

QUESTION:

Is that right?

Then -- then what

conceivably would the statute not cover?
MR. MANN:

6

I believe that their view is the only

7

thing the statute does not cover is if an individual --

8

particular individual files an application and it is

9

denied, on I'm not sure what particular basis.

I guess if

10

it's denied on the basis of something that -- that would

11

not deny anybody else's application.

14

A -- a --

QUESTION:

It's hard to think of something that

MR. MANN:

Well, in most cases I believe that's

would.

15

true because the requirements for relief are fairly

16

generalized; you have to be here since 1982 unlawfully and

17

you have to have not left since 1986.

18

and innocent absence actually is one of the most soft

19

provisions in the statute, because there obviously is some

20

play in that particular phrase could mean, but being here

21

since 1982 is a clear provision.

22

The brief, casual

But there are a lot of things that -- legal

23

questions that arose under the act and some of them --

most of them were decided by regulations, but some of them

were decided by the LAU.

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's

But we don't believe that Irwin substantially

changed this Court's jurisprudence on that issue.

what Irwin says is that generally Congress believes that

statutory filing deadlines should be equitably tolled.

Now, there are clearly certain types --

In our view this is not the type of

I'd like to address that for a moment.

distinction to us between an individual filing deadline

20

and a statute of limitations, for example, which will say

you have to file for relief within 6 years after your

cause of action arises.

23

There's a

believe is at issue in Irwin.

Now sometimes it may be a

statute of limitations, sometimes it may be called

something else, but that's one type of statutes to which

we think equitable tolling generally applies.
This case and Pangilinan, however, involve

The program in this case ended on May 4th, 1988.

10

And we don't think that that type of deadline should be

11

subject to tolling, because it's -- it's a requirement for

12

relief.

13

Now, even if it is subject to equitable tolling,

14

it seems to us that the - - that this is not remotely the

15

type of case as to which equitable tolling would be

appropriate.

17

did that is offered as a justification for equitable

tolling is that INS issued regulations explaining the

circumstances under which it believed people would be

eligible for relief.

21

What -- what INS and the attorney general

It said if you were gone from the United States

22

without advance permission, you're not eligible.

whether that was right or wrong, that's just a regulation

explaining the circumstances in which you may or may not

be eligible for relief.

2

by the United States Government should do, is you apply

3

for the benefit and if you don't agree with the agency's

interpretation you challenge it.

And these people had exactly the same

opportunity for judicial review as everybody else under

the act, and they chose not to apply and so they're not

And even if this suit had not been filed in the

12

district court, they would have gotten relief when the

injunction -- when the regulations were withdrawn, because

14

INS would have had to given the relief sooner or later.

15

When the person got to the court of appeals they could not

have deported them because the court of appeals would have

ruled that they were entitled to legalization based on the

fact that INS had withdrawn the regulation.

The real reason respondents are unable to secure

relief is that they declined to take advantage of the

21

12-month opportunity Congress offered them.

You have to

22

remember this was an extraordinary statute.

Congress was

6

QUESTION:

They're a little counterintuitive.

7

To say that an alien who is here by presenting false

8

documents is to be presumed legally here is a bit

9

counterintuitive, isn't it?
MR. MANN:

10

Well, actually, if you compare that

11

provision of the --of IRCA with a corollary provision

12

about exclusion, I think the regulation actually comes

13

pretty close to -- to being correct.

14

remember is that if the person entered with a false - -

15

with false documents in that manner it would be fair to

16

say the person entered by fraud, and a person who enters

17

by fraud is excludable unless he can secure a waiver from

18

the attorney general.

19

What you have to

And so what the regulation effectively did is by

20

saying that the people can't come in at all, it should

21

have said the person is ineligible for relief unless he

22

can secure a waiver for the fraud from the attorney

general.

About a year later they discovered it was

Also, Congress provided for a stay of

the same narrow question that was raised in McNary,

whether Congress intended to preclude truly meaningful

these two class actions, raising generic, statutory, and

constitutional claims for which an abuse of discretion

time, simultaneous with the adoption of the legalization

The TRO was stayed

me, I made that point earlier.

7

This case, just as in McNary, is a case in which

8

Congress had readily at hand far broader language of

9

section 1331 preclusion that it could have used.

McNary

gave examples of preclusive language that would have

11

precluded a challenge to a regulation, as this was.

12

McNary -- McNary involved policies and practices that

14

I believe that the argument that INS is making

15

in this case is that the distinction between McNary and

this case is that there was a regulation that was

promulgated through the process of notice and comment

Moreover, the regulations that were adopted

manner suggested by Justice O'Connor earlier, that if a

that the facial validity of their entry then converted

13

There are several points about

The first is I don't really think that has

14

anything to do with the jurisdictional question.

15

district courts in this case concluded that they had

jurisdiction over claims that certain INS regulations

believe that is incorrect and that's what the first

question in this case is.

we're wrong on that, was it proper for the district courts

to grant relief to people who did not file in a timely

What -- what we have conceded, though, is -- we

6

did not appeal from the district court with respect to

7

people who applied for relief largely because they were

8

going to get relief sooner or later anyway, so there's no

9

reason for us to appeal.

If we withdrew the regulations

10

the people would eventually secure legalization, and so

11

there's no reason for us to continue to litigate about it.

12

It is our view that there are - - there are some

13

sets of fact patterns where the person did not force INS

14

to accept his application that will constitute applying

15

for relief under the act.

17

fact situation.

MR. MANN:

Why is it different from

Well, for one thing, because I think

that title VII is violated by a discriminatory practice

that the -- is violated by discriminatory practice that

24

poses a considerable headwind to blacks getting

MR. MANN:

What's the

But I don't believe -- I don't

believe that title VII contains a provision saying -- that

says that you have to apply for a job in order to have

standing under the act, and that if you don't courts

But neither does this statute.

MR. MANN:

Excuse me?

QUESTION:

Neither does this statute.

13

MR. MANN:

Well --

14

QUESTION:

It specifies a period in which you

15

may apply, but it doesn't have the other language in it

16

either.

MR. MANN:

But the only people --

QUESTION:

It's a fair reading that you must,

because -- but it's also a fair reading that if you're

going to seek relief for being denied a job, you ought to

MR. MANN:

That's a -- that would be your normal

I think that's quite a different case

involving title VII as a remedial statute directed at

25

private employers.

QUESTION:

Is this a remedial statute?

2

MR. MANN:

This is a statute giving a very-

important immigration benefit to private individuals from

4

the Government, and in light of the customary requirements

that people apply for relief from the Government -QUESTION:

6

What if you did have a sign up

that --on the site that said don't apply unless such and

8

such, apply, and then they didn't apply.

9

would they then be discouraged or would they have to come

10

in and file the application?

11

MR. MANN:

Would then --

I think if the -- if the sign said we

12

will not accept applications from people who are in the

13

following fact situations, period, I believe that would be

14

different.

But I think if -QUESTION:

Then you'd apply the same rule as in

No.

title VII.

17

I think that if the person -- I

18

think that if the person in that case came into -- if the

19

person came in and the sign was there and the person

20

refused to file because of that sign, they would have

21

applied.

I'd like to point out, though --

QUESTION:

They would or would not have applied?

MR. MANN:

They would have applied.

Okay.

case is, if you look at the legalization manual and

2

last -- we've lodged with the Court the entire part of the

3

legalization manual that's at issue here.

4

If you go into an INS office it costs you $420

to apply for a family.

Most of these people are not

dramatically wealthy, and that is quite a bit of money to

7

them.

8

ineligible, the clerk says you're not going to get relief.

That if they come into INS's offices and the person

If the person still wants to pay the $420, the manual is

11

quite clear that the person can and should take the

application.

It's very clear about this, that the person

I take it there's no finding that

19

MR. MANN:

There is no finding that this policy

suspect that there are members of the respondent class

with respect to whom the policy was violated.

mistakes.

With all candor, I would be willing to

there were a lot of people and INS may have made mistakes.

That's why you have administrative appellate review, so

that INS can correct its mistakes.
A few other things I wanted to mention.

One of

the most important things, I think, from the argument of

respondents is that he -- he agreed that there was really
