ORAL ARGUMENT OF CRAIG J. DONALDSON

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. DONALDSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

This case comes to the Court from a decision of

13

the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,

14

which allowed the respondents who were claimants in

15

Pioneer's chapter 11 case to file their proofs of claim

16

out of time based upon a finding by the Sixth Circuit that

17

their failure to file within the originally prescribed

18

deadline was the result of excusable neglect.

19

To reach that result, the Sixth Circuit adopted

20

a test that was first enunciated in the Ninth Circuit in

21

the case of In re Dix and has been referred to frequently

22

as the liberal interpretation of excusable neglect

23

focusing on five factors set forth in that opinion.

24
25

The Sixth Circuit also, to reach the result that
it did, had to consider an equitable factor which was, in

1

its opinion, there was no prejudice to the debtor to allow

2

these proofs of claim to be filed under the excusable

3

neglect standard.

4

And finally, what it had to do, contrary to the

5

decision of this Court in Link v. the Wabash Railroad

6

decided some 30 years ago, said that it was inappropriate

7

for the courts below to punish the respondents for the

8

neglect of their counsel.

9
0

We suggest to the Court that this opinion
clearly is wrong on all three counts and must be reversed.
The first error is in the adoption of the test

2

itself.

3

adopted by the Sixth Circuit and followed by the Ninth

4

does violence to and runs plainly contrary to the plain

5

language of rule 9006(b)( ) itself, which states that

6

where, as here, a motion for an extension of time was

7

filed after the deadline has expired, the court has to

8

find that the failure to act was the result of excusable

9

neglect.

20

Petitioner submits to the Court that the test

As the Eleventh Circuit stated, and we contend

2

properly so, in the South Atlantic case, the words failure

22

to act in the plain language of the rule limit the focus

23

of the inquiry to the actions or inactions of the movant

24

and to the reasons for their failure to act within the

25

time provided, and that they do not permit, as the Ninth

1

Circuit has done and the Sixth Circuit has done in this

2

case, consideration of factors other than why didn't they

3

do what they were supposed to do within the time they were

4

supposed to do it, and what were the reasons for that.

5

The concept that there is no prejudice to the

6

debtor we submit under the authorities, not only the

7

Eleventh Circuit, but in the decisions of the Second,

8

Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits that we have

9

cited in our briefs, all hold uniformly that there is no

10

room for consideration of so-called equitable factors in

11

determining whether the failure to act under rule 9006 is

12

a result of excusable neglect.

13

The bankruptcy code quite clearly in section

14

1111(a) dictates who must in a chapter 11 case file a

15

proof of claim, and it says that if your claim is listed

16

as disputed, contingent, or unliquidated, you must file a

17

proof of claim.

18

code section goes on to say also that if your claim is not

19

listed or you do not agree with the amount listed on the

20

debtor's schedule, you must file a proof of claim.

21

the facts here clearly show that three of the respondents

22

were listed as disputed and unliquidated, and one was not

23

listed at all.

24
25

Bankruptcy rule 3003 supplementing the

And

We submit to the Court that the congressional
intent that underlies section 1111 in the bankruptcy rules

1

is to clearly place an affirmative duty on creditors who

2

fall within the definition of the code and rules to file

3

their proofs of claim if they want to be able to

4

participate in the debtor's chapter 11 reorganization in

5

three very important respects:

6

allowed; two, to have a right to vote on the plan of

7

reorganization; and three, and probably most importantly,

8

to receive a distribution from the debtor's estate.

9

one, to have their claim

And as the decisions of the other courts of

10

appeals that we have cited in our brief recognize, there

11

was a congressional intent underlying this section

12

requiring these creditors to file these claims to promote

13

certainty and finality in chapter 11 proceedings.

14

these courts, contrary to the Sixth Circuit in this case

15

and the Ninth Circuit in the Dix case, say that this

16

congressional intent precludes courts from finding

17

exceptions based on equitable considerations or equitable

18

factors.
QUESTION:

19

And

Well, Mr. Donaldson, I guess this

20

case may turn on what we mean by excusable neglect under

21

the statute.

MR. DONALDSON:

22

23

I would agree wholeheartedly,

Justice O'Connor.

24
25

Would you agree?

QUESTION:
neglect?

And what's our test for excusable

What does that mean, do you suppose?

MR. DONALDSON:

1

Excusable neglect, as I'm sure

2

the Court knows, is nowhere defined in the bankruptcy code

3

or the rules and, for that matter, is nowhere defined in

4

the similar rule 6 of the Federal Rules.

5

Circuit in the South Atlantic case defined excusable

6

neglect as follows:

7

that was due to circumstances which were beyond the

8

reasonable control of the person whose duty it was to

9

perform.
QUESTION:

10

The Eleventh

the failure to timely perform a duty

Well, why is that definition any

11

improvement on the statutory language?

It doesn't seem to

12

say anything more than excusable neglect.

13

MR. DONALDSON:

14

Mr. Chief Justice, for this reason.

15

talks about excusable neglect in this definition which

16

says -- the essential part being beyond the reasonable

17

control, granted it is somewhat nebulous, but I think it

18

clearly implies that when you come into court saying

19

excusable neglect, you have to come in and present

20

circumstances that are unique or extraordinary, that are

21

beyond - -

22

QUESTION:

I think it is an improvement,
When the statute

Doesn't the provision of the -- what

23

does the Federal -- provision in the Federal Rules that

24

talks about default judgments say?

25

term excusable neglect?

Doesn't it use the

MR. DONALDSON:

1

If Your Honor please, rule 55(c)

2

that talks about the entry of default only is for cause

3

shown.

4

aside a default judgment entered by the court, talks about

5

excusable neglect.

Rule 60(b), where you would come in to ask to set

QUESTION:

6

Why do we need a definition of

7

excusable neglect?

8

you think Congress may have intended to leave it largely

9

to the discretion of the initial court, the bankruptcy

10
11
12

13

Why not leave it largely to - - don't

court?
MR. DONALDSON:
Chief Justice.

I think the answer is yes, Mr.

If I may expound, though.

I think Congress, by using the term excusable

14

neglect, certainly left it to the courts to exercise their

15

discretion.

16

years ago in United States v. Boyle, what elements

17

constitute excusable neglect is a question of law that

18

clearly is unsettled, and we are asking the Court here

19

today in this case to settle it.

20

However, as this Court said not too many

QUESTION:

Well, don't you think it's rather

21

strange to talk about events beyond somebody's control

22

when you're trying to define excusable neglect?

23

neglect is always -- is never beyond your control, is it?

24

That's just sort of -- negligence.

25

your control?

I mean,

Is that ever beyond

MR. DONALDSON:

Justice White, the answer to

your question --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DONALDSON:

I would think --- is no, as phrased, because

5

neglect, obviously, means that something has to be within

6

your control and you failed to do it.

7

enunciated by the Eleventh Circuit and followed by the

8

substantial --

9

QUESTION:

But the test, as

I would think the Eleventh Circuit

10

definition would just -- how could you ever prove that

11

neglect was beyond your control?

12

MR. DONALDSON:

Well, if Your Honor please,

3

they're not saying it's beyond your control.

4

it by saying it's beyond your reasonable control.

5

don't say it's -- they don't say you have to come in and

6

prove something was totally beyond your control before you

7

show excusable neglect.

8
9

QUESTION:

They qualify

That still doesn't sound like a

disregard or carelessness of any kind, and that's the

20

meaning of neglect, is it not?

21

Eleventh Circuit reads the neglect word out of the

22

statutory phrase, out of the rule.

23

MR. DONALDSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

They

It seems to me that the

I don't believe so.

Because if you say reasonable, well,

then it's not carelessness.

MR. DONALDSON:

1

Well, they say beyond the

2

reasonable control, and I think what they mean by that is

3

-- and I think the case authority supports it -- is that

4

mere ordinary, garden variety neglect of counsel, simple

5

inadvertence if you will, is not going to suffice to let

6

someone be relieved from a deadline that is imposed by

7

other rules of the court, that that discretion that's

8

vested in the court has to be circumscribed by something

9

that shows that the reason you failed to act is due to

10

something unique or extraordinary.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but you just say it isn't

12

excusable.

13

the courts decide whether it's excusable or not.
MR. DONALDSON:

14
15

And let

I think that -- I think

that's -QUESTION:

16
17

You just -- what's wrong with that?

That's not enough?

Isn't that

enough?
MR. DONALDSON:

18

I think that's proper, Justice

19

White, but I think someone -- and I respectfully suggest

20

it falls to the duty of this Court -- is to tell the

21

courts below how they determine whether it's going to be

22

excusable.

23

QUESTION:

Well, did the -- the court below

24

didn't even ever get around to determining whether the

25

attorney's error was excusable or not, did it?

MR. DONALDSON:

Well, I would think any attorney

MR. DONALDSON:

12

No, not since -- in substance as

QUESTION:

So, really --

Mr. Donaldson, I don't know why you

18

concede.

It seems -- maybe I misunderstood, but you

19

appear to concede that neglect always has an element of

20

negligence or blameworthiness about it.

21

concede that?

Why do you

I don't think that it does invariably.

MR. DONALDSON:

12

wish you would say it.

No.

Donaldson?

Having had the benefit of that suggestion, can

2

you give us an example of excusable neglect as either you

3

or Justice Scalia would interpret it?

4

MR. DONALDSON:

5

QUESTION:

What would be acceptable --

What would -- when should a judge

ever excuse neglect either the way you define it or the

7

way Justice Scalia does it?

11

MR. DONALDSON:

If -- one that comes right away

to mind, Justice Stevens, is if the attorney or the
counsel never received notice of the bar date.
QUESTION:

And you'd say that was neglect in

12

that -- and you think that's the way in which they meant

13

the neglect.

14

MR. DONALDSON:

I think that's a unique or

15

extraordinary -- I don't go by so much the word neglect as

16

I do the word excusable.

17

QUESTION:

What if you had a tickler system set

18

up in your office that worked regularly where you were

19

given a note the day before something was due that it's

20

due tomorrow, and it just failed on this one occasion?

Would that be an example of, A, neglect and, B, of

excusable neglect?

25

No, Your Honor, it would not.

Which -- it would be -- it would not

be neglect or it would not be excusable?

MR. DONALDSON:

It would be neglect, but it

would not be excusable because --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. DONALDSON:

That's what happened in this case.
Well, Justice Stevens, I would

5

say based on the record here, Mr. Richards went far beyond

6

the grounds of neglect or concurrent findings by the

7

bankruptcy court and the district court that not only was

8

he negligent, he was totally indifferent to the bar date.

9
10

11

QUESTION:

But why in the case, the hypothetical

I put to you is that neglect not excusable?
MR. DONALDSON:

12

the tickler system?

QUESTION:

14

MR. DONALDSON:

The failure in your office of

Yes.
I think because the cases hold

15

and the way the statute is construed, that mere neglect of

16

counsel or counsel's staff will not rise to the dignity of

17

being excusable.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but by - - mere -- but by

19

hypothesis the statute says some neglect is excusable, and

20

to say that mere neglect is never excusable simply defies

21

the statutory language.

22

MR. DONALDSON:

Well, I think where that gets

23

perilously close to, Mr. Chief Justice, is this.

24

something like if you did have a tickler system and you've

25

taken all the steps you could conceivably take to make

Maybe

1

sure you don't fall through the trap of missing a deadline

2

and that system malfunctions, but that leads to these

3

problems.

4

shouldn't you have had a backup system, and I think you

5

get into a series of what if's that engulf the rule.

Then the next question might be, well,

QUESTION:

6

Well, isn't that an argument for

7

confiding a great deal of discretion as Congress may have

a

intended to the district courts or the bankruptcy courts

9

here?

io

We don't want thousands of little annotations in

law books saying this is or is not excusable neglect.
MR. DONALDSON:

ii

Right.

I think the Congress

12

clearly has conferred that discretion on the lower courts,

13

but it also attempted to, and I think does, circumscribe

14

it.

15

someone runs into court and says -- well, particularly

16

like this case, runs into court and says, well, it's my

17

lawyer's fault, or I forgot to read something, or a lawyer

18

comes in and said I forgot to read something.

19

were permitted to be the standard of excusable neglect, I

20

dare say it would do away with the efficacy of any

21

deadline set under any rules of procedure.

22

It's not an unbridled discretion that any time

QUESTION:

If that

Well, would you be satisfied to win

23

this case on the ground that the court of appeals didn't

24

blame the client, they didn't stick the client with his

25

lawyer's neglect, and therefore did not decide whether the

MR. DONALDSON:

the system and the efficient administration of justice

10

throughout the Federal system at least, I would like to

QUESTION:

You want to confine -- you want to

put some definition into excusable neglect.
MR. DONALDSON:

I would like this Court to adopt

15

as bright a line as possible as to what factors are to be

16

considered or what the appropriate definition is of

17

excusable neglect because - -

18

QUESTION:

Do I understand that your position is

19

that the factors to be included can only be factors that

20

have to do with the action or the state of mind of the

21

person who is allegedly excusably neglectful?

22

MR. DONALDSON:

Yes, sir.

So that you cannot take into account,

for example, how much harm has been caused by the action.

Correct.

QUESTION:

He's either excusably neglectful or

2

not, and if he is, it doesn't matter if it has caused a

3

whole lot of harm.

4

It's still excusable neglect.

MR. DONALDSON:

That's correct.

I think it has

5

to be determined solely by the actions of the moving party

6

and the reasons for those actions without consideration of

7

any other, what you might call equitable factors, such as

8

prejudice or lack thereof.

9

QUESTION:

May I go a step or so?

Whether it's

10

a $100 million windfall or a 10 cent windfall is totally

11

irrelevant.

12

13

That's one.

Also, I take it it's totally irrelevant whether
it's a 10-minute delay or a 3-year delay.

14

MR. DONALDSON:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

I think it has to be.

How do you get around the fact that

16

the statute reads that the court may allow the late filing

17

in a case of excusable neglect, which seems to suggest

18

that there may be cases of excusable neglect in which it

19

will and other cases of excusable neglect in which it will

20

not allow the late filing?

21

that it's appropriate for the court to look at the

22

consequences to third parties, whether they're getting

23

hurt or whether they're not getting hurt?

And isn't it at that point

24

MR. DONALDSON:

I think, to answer your

25

question, no, and if I may expound.

1

The statute - - the last sentence begins with the

2

failure to act.

3

failure to act directs the focus solely and exclusively to

4

what the movant did or didn't do and the reasons for that.

5

I think the plain language of the words

QUESTION:

Well, it may -- that may direct the

6

court's attention to the reasons for the failure to act in

7

determining what is excusable, but it certainly does not

8

exclude from the court's consideration the consequences to

9

third parties in determining whether a - - an excusable

10

neglect should, in fact, be a basis for precluding him and

11

making -- precluding the party from making a late filing.
MR. DONALDSON:

12

But I think it does for this

13

reason.

14

that there was excusable neglect, however determined, even

15

if that would result in the most extreme prejudice to the

16

debtor, I think the court has to exercise its discretion

17

and let that creditor file its claim regardless of the

18

consequences if --

19

If a party could come in and, in fact, establish

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's no discretion at all.

20

I mean, if that were going to be -- if that were the

21

intent of Congress, why didn't Congress simply make it

22

mandatory that if the neglect was found to be excusable, a

23

late filing would be permitted?

They could have done that, but

they did not.

1

Well, I know, and it seems to me

there's some significance in the fact that they did not.

They left it a discretionary judgment or they left some

MR. DONALDSON:

And yet, in the hypothesis that you

in and proves that the neglect -- that their failure to

act was excusable neglect, that they have brought

11

themselves within rule 9006(b)(1), and that the court

12

would have to exercise its discretion to let them in.
QUESTION:

13

But, no, they have brought themselves

members of the Court have been addressing in their

2

questions to my adversary, and that is the fundamental

3

difference between the petitioners and the respondents in

4

this case is that the petitioners advocate, in essence, a

nondiscretionary, strict, in their words, inflexible rule

6

to be applied only in extraordinary circumstances.

The respondents, on the other hand, submit that
this is and should be a discretionary standard in which

the lower courts are permitted flexibility in the exercise

of their discretion as guided perhaps by certain

guideposts set by this Court.

QUESTION:

Well, in this case, Mr. Lucas, the

bankruptcy court ruled against your client, and then the

district court in the exercise of its discretion ruled

against it, didn't it?

17

MR. LUCAS:

The bankruptcy court did, Your

effect, abused its discretion because of the way that it

20

weighed the factors.

MR. LUCAS:

I believe there was an abuse of

discretion in this case, Your Honor, and that's one of the

17

points of our appeal is that the bankruptcy court erred in

18

the way it weighed these factors because the way it

weighed them -- and I'll come to this in a moment, but it

20

weighed them in a way that inevitably would find against

and which was continually urged by petitioners.

2

Your Honor, let me add --

3

QUESTION:

I understand one of your arguments to

4

be that excusable neglect cannot consist of circumstance

5

- - exclusively of circumstances reasonably beyond the

6

control of the party for the reason that that would not be

7

neglect because there would not be any negligence or blame

8

attachable, if it were circumstances beyond the control of

9

the party.

Isn't that one of the arguments you make?

10

MR. LUCAS:

That is correct, Justice Scalia.

11

QUESTION:

Am I to understand then that where

12

you are negligent or blameworthy, but you have some

13

excuse, you are in better shape for purposes of this rule

14

than if you're not blameworthy at all?

15

MR. LUCAS:

16

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor, because -What do you do with a person where

the circumstances are beyond his control?

QUESTION:

Do you think the court of appeals said the client

QUESTION:

whether the attorney's negligence was excusable.
MR. LUCAS:

QUESTION:

And the question here is what should those

QUESTION:

Well, you can't imagine more severe

4

consequences than in Link when the plaintiff's complaint

5

was dismissed.

6

MR. LUCAS:

That's correct, Your Honor, but

7

here's an important point about Link.

Link supports our

8

position, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is because you will

9

recall that in Link this Court affirmed the exercise of

10

discretion by the trial court.

11

dismissed a case for

the plaintiff's attorney's failure to

12

appear at a pretrial

conference, and this Court gave the

13

trial court discretion and said it could do that based

14

upon all the facts and circumstances in the record which

15

were known to the trial court, and that this Court would

16

grant the district courts that discretion.

17

QUESTION:

The trial court had

to why the bankruptcy court abused its discretion.

And the bankruptcy court said - - curiously they

11

said but early in the case, like here, and where there's a

12

short delay, like here, those factors will seldom, if

13

ever, be present.

14

QUESTION:

So, it wouldn't make any difference

15

whether the attorney's error would subject him to a

16

malpractice suit or not?

17
18
19

MR. LUCAS:

I don't think that makes a

difference, Justice White.
QUESTION:

But --

So, you're not really talking about

20

whether it was just a human error in the sense that almost

21

anybody would make it.

22

MR. LUCAS:

It was a human error.

We concede it

23

was neglect, but the way the bankruptcy court weighed

24

these factors, it said that early in the case they will

25

hardly ever be present where the delay like here is short.

1

And so, they said -- the bankruptcy court said, therefore,

2

I'm going to look at whether or not it was within their

3

reasonable control and focus on that.

4

So, early in the case where creditors, such as

5

my client, is diligent, realizes their mistake, takes

6

actions promptly to cure it, they're penalized the way the

7

bankruptcy court weighed the factors because he says,

8

well, I won't consider those because it's too early in the

9

case.

10

They won't be present.
But he created a catch-22 because late in the

11

case those factors will almost always be present.

12

a much greater risk of prejudice, impact on judicial

13

administration, bad faith, and the like late in the case.

14

QUESTION:

There's

That's an argument certainly why the

15

bankruptcy court was wrong in exercising its discretion in

16

this case, but it -- do you support the view taken by the

17

Sixth Circuit, as Justice White reads its opinion, as I

18

do, that whatever the consequences -- whatever the neglect

19

of the attorney, it should not be visited on the client?

20

MR. LUCAS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LUCAS:

Your Honor, I don't think -Can you answer it yes or no?
I don't support it the way Your

23

Honor just articulated it.

If Your Honor meant to say

24

must the sins of the attorney always be visited upon the

25

client, then I believe that the answer is no.

attempting to overrule Link, and to the extent that the

11

Sixth Circuit decision relied upon Link, we think it can

12

be affirmed on other grounds because we say in this case

13

we acknowledge that there was neglect, and we acknowledge

14

that that neglect is imputable to the respondents.

like to refer to a case --an opinion that Justice Scalia

2

wrote for the majority in 1988, Pierce v. Underwood, and

3

in that case, Your Honor may recall that the question

4

before the Court was whether or not the position of the

5

United States was substantially justified for purposes of

6

an award of attorney's fees.

7

And Justice Scalia, writing for the majority,

8

said that the Court was going to eschew what Justice

9

Scalia and the Court termed a rigorously scientific

10

approach and said because of the large number of possible

11

situations in which the phrase might arise, that it was

12

inappropriate to draw a set of narrow guidelines, that

13

this was simply an area in which the court -- the lower

14

courts had to have a substantial amount of discretion.

15

And the Court also said that it would not choose to

16

substitute a different formula for the formula

17

substantially justified which had been chosen by Congress.

18

We think that that holding is applicable to this

19

case also because what the petitioner is seeking to do,

20

Your Honors, is to substitute new words for the words that

21

exist in the rule.

was due to circumstances beyond the reasonable control of

the moving party, and that's simply not what the rule

to do with the subjective actions of the individual and

You'd have a

10

whole lot of discretion still within the meaning of

11

excusable so long as it's limited to factors affecting the

12

subjective actions of the individual.

13

And then you would have additional discretion at

the back end because even when the court finds excusable

neglect, it need not -- it may, as the rule says, but it

need not use that.

MR. LUCAS:

And once again, that would be up to

That is correct, Justice Scalia, but

19

there's nothing in the rule that dictates that approach.

20

There is simply nothing in the rule that says that the

21

only focus shall be on the actions of the moving party or

22

the party who has failed to act.

And, in fact, I think it comports not only with

the face of the rule, but just with our everyday

We say

There's a fourth element that I would suggest

2

that would go into the calculus properly which is not

covered in our brief, and that is what is the nature of

the deadline missed and what is the impact on the moving

to virtually any filing, under the Federal rules, it

applies to answers, it applies to discovery responses, it

applies to briefs, it applies to proofs of claim, it

applies to notices of appeal.

Keeping in mind that this rule applies, as I said,

And the way you weigh these factors, and

10

11

particularly the good faith factor, might vary from case

12

to case, but that's what discretion is all about.

13

that's the type of discretion that the Court allowed the

trial courts in Pierce v. Underwood, and we submit that

that discretion is appropriate here because on the face of

the rule it says that the court may in its discretion.

And

Your Honor, there's another point that I would

like to make about the source of this beyond reasonable

appears on the face of the rules or the bankruptcy code.

linchpin of their argument because it appears in the very

1

the rest of their argument flows from the need for

2

finality.

3

that was articulated by the lower courts, and they cite to

4

a Second Circuit opinion in a case called Hoos v. Dynamics

5

Corporation.

And they say, well, there's a need for finality

And they cite this need for finality there.

And the reason that's so important to the

6

7

petitioner is that without this need for finality that

8

they find in the bankruptcy code, an overriding need in

9

their view, you really can't get to the beyond reasonable

10

control language because it's just not in the rules.

11

in the Hoos v. Dynamics Corporation, the court did discuss

12

the need for finality, but -- and perhaps it was an

13

overriding or the most important need there, but the

14

circumstances were entirely different than they are today.

15

But

In that case, it was decided under the old

16

Bankruptcy Act, and in that case creditors in a chapter 11

17

case had until virtually the end of the bankruptcy process

18

in which to file their proofs of claim.

19

had to be filed by confirmation of the plan, not before.

20

That, as the Court knows, is virtually the last step in

21

the process.

Proofs of claim

In Hoos, the creditors were actually attempting

22

23

to file their claims after the plan had already been

24

confirmed.

25

There's always a need --a greater need for finality at

So, of course, there was a need for finality.

the end of the case, but the petitioners seek to

2

extrapolate from that and say, well, in Hoos there was a

3

need for finality at the end of the case.

4

there's a need for finality here at the beginning of the

5

case.

Therefore,

6

Obviously, it just doesn't follow, and without

7

that supposed need for finality, the overriding need for

8

finality, they simply can't get to this beyond reasonable

control test because that's the need that has driven every

10

court of appeal that has decided and articulated this

11

beyond reasonable control test.

Mr. Lucas, straighten me out on some

Has this plan been confirmed?

MR. LUCAS:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, it has.
And do I understand that the

unsecured creditors will be paid off 100 cents on the

MR. LUCAS:

That is correct, Justice Blackmun.

19

QUESTION:

Do you have any comments about that

20
21

as far as your clients are concerned?
MR. LUCAS:

Your Honor, it illustrates the

22

windfall to the debtor, to the petitioner, if this type of

23

procedural, defect is allowed to essentially deprive my

24

clients of their right to file the claim.

25

once the claim is filed, it is prima facie evidence of the

And, of course,

1

validity of the claim.

2

purposes of this discussion, the claim has to be accepted

3

as a valid one, and therefore, there is a $6.9 million

4

windfall to the debtor because that's the amount of

5

money - -

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. LUCAS:

So, we do believe that for

There are that many assets.
It was I believe a $55 million asset

8

case, Your Honor, and it's a 100 percent payment plan.

9

So, that is the amount that my clients have been deprived

10
11

12

13

of because their attorney was negligently 20 days late.
QUESTION:

Well, if these claims are filed, is

the 100 percent payoff affected?
MR. LUCAS:

It is affected to this extent that

14

without my clients' claims, it's a 5-year payoff.

15

our claims are factored into the plan - - if our claims are

16

allowed, it's a 10-year payoff.

17

Once

That plan, incidentally, was formulated

18

after -- the plan had not begun being drafted at the time

19

this time extension was sought.

20

-- because the litigation over the filing of these claims

21

was going on while the debtor was drafting its plan, the

22

plan anticipated and planned for the eventuality that

23

these claims would be permitted or would be allowed.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. LUCAS:

So, the plan anticipated

1

interest payable, and interest is being paid to other

2

creditors and has been since the plan was confirmed.

3

QUESTION:

Would there be any virtue in tying

4

the phrase excusable neglect in this bankruptcy rule into

5

the provisions of rule 60(b) of the Rules of Civil

6

Procedure where I'm sure there must be some decisions

7

construing the same phrase?

8

9

MR. LUCAS:

Your Honor, I think that whatever

decision this Court makes necessarily -- even if the Court

10

attempts to limit it to proofs of claim and bankruptcy

11

rule 9006, that whatever decision this Court makes will be

12

construed as also governing rule 6 and all the filings in

13

Federal civil litigation simply because the rule, for all

14

intents and purposes, are identical.

15

And the phrase excusable neglect, if the Court

16

is going to avoid the one-subsection-at-a-time approach to

17

the statutory construction, if we're going to avoid that,

18

it seems to me that it has to be construed uniformly.

19

it's going to be an absolute, strict standard allowing no

20

exceptions except for matters beyond the moving party's

21

reasonable control here, then the same must be true for a

22

party who files an answer 1 day late in a lawsuit.

If

of a defendant in a lawsuit who is served with a summons

3

and, of course, required to answer in 20 days.

through an administrative error, clerical breakdown,

5

whatever, through neglect, for reasons within his control,

6

the defendant doesn't answer the lawsuit, say, a $7

7

million lawsuit, until the 21st day.

8

morning, his answer is 9 hours late.

9

Let's take a hypothetical example

But

9:00 the next

Today, I submit and I believe that in most

10

jurisdictions around the country, most district judges

11

will think that it's in the exercise of their discretion

12

to allow an answer to be filed 9 hours late rather than to

13

deprive a party of his or her day in court and essentially

14

impose a windfall to the plaintiff, who at that point

15

would have a $6.9 million default judgment.

16

But it is precisely that sort of exercise of

17

discretion that the petitioners would deprive the trial

18

courts of exercising if their hard and fast, inflexible

19

rule is accepted in this case.

If there are no other questions, that completes

It leads to an

And as I said earlier in our argument, in

11

construing this term, it cannot be construed such that it

12

just sweeps away deadlines imposed by other rules of the

13

court which are necessary to the efficient administration

14

of justice.
In particular reference to the Sixth Circuit

15
16

17

the bankruptcy court and district court abused this

counsel.

21

QUESTION:

Well, if you want to - - I suppose the

real party in interest is the client, and if you want to

impose a rule that this is excusable if it's due to

something -- some act beyond your control, surely in this

case the negligence of his lawyer was beyond his control.

MR. DONALDSON:

But I think the rule looks,

Justice White, at the negligence of the party and the

party's counsel, and if one of them is at fault -- well,

Can that be amended?

Can the court set a file date and

MR. DONALDSON:

10

If it does so before the

expiration of the date set, the plain language of rule
