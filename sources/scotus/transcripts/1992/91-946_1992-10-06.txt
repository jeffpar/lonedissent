ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC M. LIEBERMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LIEBERMAN:

10
11

Thank you.

Mr. Justice and may

it -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case raises the question whether compliance

12

13

with a district court order enforcing an Internal Revenue

14

Service summons renders any subsequent appeal moot.
The district court below on remand enforced an

order and permitted the IRS to inspect and copy the tapes.

22

Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

the clerk of the

While the case was on

23

dismissed the appeal from the production order as moot

24

without considering or hearing argument on the merits.

25

doing so,

the court of appeals held that once a district

In

1

court enforces an Internal Revenue Service summons for the

2

production of documents, and once the documents are turned

3

over to the IRS by either the taxpayer or by a

4

disinterested third-party record holder, the case becomes

5

moot.

6

privacy, or other interests the taxpayer may have in the

7

documents and, of course, no matter how meritorious the

8

taxpayer's appeal may be on the merits, even if the

9

taxpayer is claiming privilege, IRS bad faith, or that

This rule applies no matter what proprietary,

10

there is no legitimate, ongoing Internal Revenue Service

11

investigation.

12

The court of appeals' rule here is contrary to

13

well-established mootness doctrine as enunciated by this

14

Court and by the lower Federal courts.

15

whether a case is moot has long rested on two interrelated

16

considerations:

17

controversy between the parties; and second, whether the

18

courts may grant any effectual relief to the prevailing

19

party.

20

any relief may be afforded even if it is only partial

21

relief or relief other than that originally sought at the

22

outset of the case.

23

QUESTION:

Determination of

The emphasis here is upon the question of whether

24

the issues on the merits in this litigation are finished.

They're resolved, are they not?

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Well, no, Your Honor, I don't

believe that's true.
First of all, when this Court decided the first

4

Zolin case, it found that in deciding the crime-fraud

5

issue on an attorney-client privilege issue, the district

6

court could look at any evidence not privileged and

7

lawfully obtained by the Government, and it specifically

8

noted that the question of whether the partial transcripts

9

in this case were lawfully obtained.

10

It then remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which

11

again declined to reach the issue of whether the

12

transcripts were lawfully obtained, and remanded to the

13

district court for determination of whatever other

14

objections the parties may raise, specifically noting that

15

it was not reaching that particular issue.

16

Secondly - -

17

QUESTION:

And you did not take -- certiorari

18

was not granted from that order.

19

That's the June 20 order, and that is final.

20
21

MR. LIEBERMAN:

That order is final.

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's correct.

22

But certiorari was not sought on that issue.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

So, it's the law of the case that the

court is not going to consider these transcripts.
MR. LIEBERMAN:

Oh, no, Your Honor.

We did not

seek certiorari on that issue, and the court of appeals

2

did not hold that that issue was precluded from the

3

district court.

4

going to be considering that issue.

5

the issue had been waived, and it remanded to the district

6

court to consider that issue and any other objections the

7

party might raise.

the question of whether or not the transcripts had been

Now, the other issue --

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well, but isn't that the problem?

You didn't even raise it in your original appeal.
MR. LIEBERMAN:

Well, there was no reason to,

16

Your Honor, because we were being remanded for the

17

opportunity to raise it in the district court.

18

of appeals did not preclude us from raising it on the

19

remand that the court of appeals was then ordering to the

20

district court.

21

whatever other issues the parties may raise, and footnoted

22

right at that point, that it is not reaching the issue of

MR. LIEBERMAN:

So, everything in the transcript was

covered by the documents themselves, and we've said you

can look at the documents themselves in order to determine

7

the privilege.

8

reason this case is over no matter what we do.

9

So it seems to me that that's another

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Well, one thing that we were

10

urging below, Your Honor, was that the district court look

11

at the entire tapes because we believe that they would

12

show that the privilege still remained.

13

that it was improper for the court of appeals to look at

14

the partial transcripts, then the whole issue of

15

looking -- of what evidence the district court has

16

available to it to look at becomes a live issue, and it

17

must look then, if it is going to look at anything, at the

MR. LIEBERMAN:

It gets a little confusing, Your

It certainly does.
Since the Ninth Circuit ruled

and the opinion reported at 905 F.2d, which is not the

10

opinion from which this certiorari petition was granted,

11

the Ninth Circuit remanded to the district court.

12

the case was back before the district court, evidence was

14

Service agents in other cases that there was no ongoing

21

wished to raise on the merits on the appeal back to the

the grounds that the case was now moot because the IRS now

MR. LIEBERMAN:

The Ninth Circuit could have

MR. LIEBERMAN:

2

No.

We were asking for return

3

of the copies as well, relief twice afforded in this case

4

by the district court.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but to say to return the copies

6

as well suggests that you want an order precluding their

7

use in any future proceedings.
MR. LIEBERMAN:

8

9

Honor.

No, that's not right, Your

No more true -- that is no more true in this case

10

than it was in the Sells case or in the G.M. Leasing case.

11

In both of those cases -- first, take Sells.

12

In the Sells case, where the grand jury,

13

pursuant to court order, had turned over records to the

14

Civil Department of the Justice Department and the

15

Government claimed that therefore the appeal from that

16

order was moot, the Ninth Circuit and this Court both

17

agreed that the case was not moot because the court of

18

appeals had the power to order the Civil Department of the

19

Justice Department to turn over the originals and the

20

copies of the record, and that would afford partial relief

21

to the individual.

22

Similarly, in each and every one of the cases

23

involving Federal Trade Commission subpoenas, for which

24

the Government must seek a court order of enforcement, in

25

numerous cases, the similar situation has arisen where in

QUESTION:

Not in the past.

That's right.

And so, what good is an order like

that to say that the IRS shall not further look at your

copies, which perhaps would be the counterpart of the

Sells order?

MR. LIEBERMAN:

What good is that going to do you?
Well, precisely the same good

that it was going to do the person in the Sells case, Your
Honor.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but the complaint in Sells was

12

that these people were disclosing things among themselves,

13

and that it would keep right on going.

14

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Precisely the same thing as here

15

too.

The IRS has these tapes and is disclosing these

16

things among itself, and the people who have had access

17

have continuing access, just as in Sells.

18

Similarly, in G.M. Leasing.

QUESTION:

Well, how is it that so many courts

20

of appeals haven't really caught on to this argument of

21

yours?

Mr. Lieberman, there's a similar

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Is that

That's precisely right, Justice

O' Connor.
QUESTION:

Is the language of that statute the

same as here?
MR. LIEBERMAN:

The language of that statute, as

10

with this statute, permits -- authorizes the Federal

11

courts to enforce a subpoena order when the FTC brings a

12

proceeding.

contradiction to the line of authority in the summons

enforcement cases.

In those cases -- and here there is a line of

the FTC has subpoenaed material in the course of its

investigations, I suppose.

1

And the Government attempts to make a

2

distinction with the FTC cases by saying that those cases

3

are all adjudicatory subpoena cases and, therefore, that

4

it's the equivalent of a suppression order, but that's not

5

true.

6

are investigatory subpoenas.

7

Invention Submission case, cited in our briefs, in the

D.C. Circuit, was clearly an investigatory subpoena, and

11

FTC because, it said, the documents and the copies can be

12

returned or the copies can be destroyed, just as in Sells.

13

In the search and seizure area, the Government

14

cites the General Motors Leasing Corporation case to

15

support its view, and quite frankly, I find that rather

16

peculiar because I think, if anything, G.M. Leasing

17

suggests that we are correct in this.

And the other thing that's in the

somebody that may be affected by the outcome of this case?

17

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Well, Your Honor,

if we're

18

correct that there is no ongoing investigation, then the

1

risk is simply the risk that any citizen faces in having

20

his or her private papers in the possession of the

Government for it to rummage through or use as it wishes

second'way in which Congress has recognized this interest.

15

When Congress amended section 7609 to provide for the

Congress took the position that the taxpayer -- and this

In addition, there is the additional objection

we raised of whether there was an ongoing investigation.

8

Now, I think the important issue, the thing to

keep in mind here, is that the issue before this Court is

10

whether or not our appeal was moot, not whether or not we

11

would have won or lost that appeal.

12

which has broad reference to summons enforcement cases.

13

As has been noted, there is a split in the circuits on it.

14

Most of the circuits go against us, and -- but most of

15

those circuit decisions against us, I submit, are contrary

16

to parallel lines of authority dealing with the Federal

may it please the Court:
In the current appeal to the Ninth Circuit that

2

3

is under review, we argued both that petitioner's claims

4

were res judicata and that the appeal was moot because all

5

of the materials had, in fact, been produced because of

6

the denial of stays and the originals had been returned.

7

The court of appeals did not reach our res

8

judicata contentions, but decided only that the appeal was

9

moot.

We argued both that the claims that are being made

10

are claims that have already been resolved against

11

petitioners, and even if some of the claims were not, they

12

could have been raised at the earlier stage, and unlike

13

collateral estoppel, under principles of res judicata, the

14

claims'are barred because it's the same litigation between

15

the same parties, and petitioner is not free to raise

16

these claims seriatim rather than all at once.

17

But we have not urged the court -- we've pointed

18

out this obstacle to petitioner's prevailing, but we have

19

not urged this Court to reach and sort out the res

20

judicata issues which the court of appeals did not reach.

21

We assumed that the Court granted certiorari to decide the

22

question presented in the petition, which was the mootness

23

question on which there is a conflict in the circuits, and

24

that is what we have addressed.

the res judicata obstacle to petitioner's prevailing is a

2

reason to dismiss the writ as improvidently granted, but

we have not urged that either.

I suppose our problem is that if

There can be protective orders,

And one of the issues before was

23

Do you still take the position there's no such authority?

QUESTION:

I'm talking about this

MR. WALLACE:

Under this statute, there is a

5

statutory requirement that production, when it's ordered,

6

be for a reasonable time and under reasonable

7

circumstances.

8

generally has been understood to mean that we can keep the

originals only for a reasonable time and then should

I'm referring to section 7605(a), and that

return the originals.
QUESTION:

But can the order --my question is

12

really can the district court say to you I think the

13

reasonable time is 30 days, return them after 30 days?

14

Would that be within the authority of the district court

15

to fix the reasonable time?

16

MR. WALLACE:

It's rather seldom done in these

summons enforcement orders, but there would be nothing

do that?

7

Could the subpoenaed party go into court 10

MR. WALLACE:

Could they

Well, we think that once a

8

production has occurred, the jurisdiction of the court has

9

ended under the narrow jurisdiction conferred to enforce

10

an Internal Revenue summons, but that the court, as any

11

court does, retains authority to enforce its order.

12

if, in fact, an implied in law condition of the order is

13

that the originals can be kept for inspection only for a

14

reasonable time, because that's what 7605(a) says, then

15

the court retains authority to see whether we have

16

exceeded that implied condition in his order.

QUESTION:

And

implied condition in a case like this that the

MR. WALLACE:

Give them back.

That would be an implied condition

3

that would contradict the overall pattern of statute and

decision law concerning judicial anticipation and

direction of Internal Revenue Service investigations.

6

I think the answer to this case emerges with

7

greater clarity if we put the particular summons

8

enforcement question into the landscape in which the

9

summons authority is placed.

There is - - throughout the

10

U.S. Code, there's a thematic pattern that this Court has

11

recognized in its decisions repeatedly, and that is that

12

Congress has, with only very narrowly delimited

13

exceptions, prohibited preassessment litigation about tax

14

controversies because that litigation could interfere with

15

the Service's investigatory and collection efforts.

There's the Tax Anti-Injunction Act.

Exception to the Declaratory Judgment Act, and there are

The question before you is whether

that proceeding can extend to monitoring of the IRS'

the Government agrees to such a restriction.

courts in to supervise and delay the conduct of IRS

QUESTION:

16

That's what Congress has

You would say to wait in this case

wouldn't do them any good because it's res judicata.

Well, it happens to be res
That's correct.

Thank you, Your Honor.

brief, the Government made seven copies of the tapes and

they reduced them to two cassette tapes and a computer

disk.

As we point out on pages 9 to 10 of our reply

QUESTION:

When?

7

MR. LIEBERMAN:

When?
When the Government returned the

8

copies on March 14, 1991, after having received them the

9

second time -- and this is noted on the docket -QUESTION:

10

So, they had copies at the time

QUESTION:

Had they had copies at the time the

district court first ordered them to return?
MR. LIEBERMAN:

Yes, they did, and those were

returned as well.
QUESTION:

And yet, the Government never claimed

the case was moot at that time.
MR. LIEBERMAN:

That's precisely correct, and by

22

their action in seeking them for a third time, they

23

thereby demonstrated that the case was not moot because

24

the relief had been effectual.

MR. LIEBERMAN:

2

QUESTION:

3

Did they have copies of each and

every document?

4

MR. LIEBERMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

They needed them again.

Yes, absolutely.

Well, so the Government is just wrong

in saying that they didn't have copies.

7

MR. LIEBERMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. LIEBERMAN:

That's precisely correct.

How do we know that?
It's in the record, Your Honor;

10

if you look at the docket sheet on items number 75 and 77

11

on pages 74 and 85 of the excerpts of record.
I just want to clarify one other point.

12

We are

13

arguing that there was no legitimate purpose - - no

14

legitimate investigation at the time of the disclosure

15

order, and therefore the Government never had a right to

16

obtain the documents, not that at some reasonable time

17

thereafter, the documents had to be returned.

18

the original jurisdiction of the court invoked by the

19

Government pursuant to an act of Congress was still

20

applicable.
QUESTION:

21

Therefore,

But you know, there are other areas

22

of the law where you -- you're compelled to stand on your

23

rights.

24

you have to do it right then and there, take your chances.

25

That's not unheard of.

If you want to challenge the Government action,

appropriate here in this area, where Congress has

2

displayed great sensitivity about staying the process of

tax collection?

4

MR. LIEBERMAN:

Well, you raise a very

5

interesting question which we raise in this case, Your

6

Honor.

7

because this summons was directed to a disinterested

8

third-party record holder, and in -- we particularly urged

9

that in that context, the case cannot be deemed as moot

We had no opportunity to stand on our rights

10

because even if in the taxpayer disclosure situation, you

11

can argue that the taxpayer, albeit it under threat of

12

contempt, gave up his interest in the controversy, that

13

certainly can't be said as here --

QUESTION:

MR. LIEBERMAN:

15
16

Yes, I had forgotten that.
-- where the taxpayer had no

opportunity to do so.

Thank you very much.
