ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALFRED H. SIGMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. SIGMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents the Court with the issue of

12

whether a person who knowingly participates in a breach of

13

fiduciary duty under ERISA is liable to restore losses

14

suffered by a retirement plan.

15

In 1987, the Pension Benefit Guaranty

16

Corporation imposed a distress termination on the Kaiser

17

Steel retirement plan because of what it described at the

18

time as its gross underfunding.

19

other retirees similarly situated, suffered substantial

20

losses in their retirement income.

21

example, suffered a reduction in his monthly benefit from

22

$2,000 to $500.

23

Petitioners, and all

Mr. Mertens, for

Petitioners brought this action to recover all

24

losses to the plan.

Petitioners sued the plan's

25

fiduciaries, officials of Kaiser, for allegedly breaching

1

their

2

plan's actuary, in a separate action which the district

3

court consolidated, for allegedly knowingly participating

4

in that fiduciary breach.

5

fiduciary duties to the plan, and also sued the

Essentially, plaintiffs allege that the Kaiser

6

fiduciaries and Hewitt acted together to purposefully

7

underfund the plan by failing to change the plan's

8

actuarial assumptions to reflect Kaiser's decision to

9

essential terminate its steel-making operations.

10

As a consequence of that decision, a great

11

number of Kaiser employees were -- were forced to take

12

full early retirement benefits, which in turn greatly

13

increased the funding costs to the plan.

14

did not fund the plan in a manner to pay for the increased

15

retirements caused by the closing down of its steel

16

operations, the plan became insolvent.

17

Because Kaiser

I'd like to argue three points to the Court

18

today, the first being that under ERISA section 502(a)(3),

19

which provides for all appropriate equitable relief to

20

redress violations of the act, that that statute is broad

21

enough to encompass redress against a person who knowingly

22

participates in a breach of fiduciary duty.

23

principle also is a fundamental principle of the common

24

law of trusts, which should be incorporated into ERISA.

25

And that

Secondly, I'd like to argue that when Congress

1

in 1989 enacted the so-called OBRA amendment to ERISA, it

2

made -- which had explicitly referred to a preexisting

3

underlying cause of action under section 502 for recovery

4

of losses to a plan caused by any person who knowingly

5

participates in a breach of fiduciary duty, that that

6

amendment had confirmed that the right on the part of

7

participants and beneficiaries to sue knowing participants

8

in fiduciary breaches had always existed under section

9

502.

10

Finally, Your Honors, I would like to argue that

11

the liability that we argue for here today is essential in

12

order to further the remedial purposes of the statute, the

13

primary function being to deter fiduciary breaches in the

14

first place, so as to secure the interests of retirees in

15

their pension benefits.

16

QUESTION:

If there were a suit under State

17

law - - and I think this question relates on all three of

18

the points you want to bring up, or at least it -- it

19

gives me an initial grasp of the case.

20

suit under State law, what would your position be on

21

whether or not there's preemption?
MR. SIGMAN:

22

If there were a

Well, in fact we did raise a claim

23

under State law.

State law.

25

We sued Hewitt for malpractice under

And after this Court granted certiorari, the

1

preemption grounds.
I think that the answer to that question in

2

3

part's going to depend on the resolution of this case.

4

would point out to the Court, however, that ERISA does

5

provide specifically that plans can be sued and can sue.

6

And there are many instances where district courts have

7

held that malpractice actions against attorneys, against

8

other service providers to plans, are not preempted.

9

once again, that issue is not presented by this case

10

because Hewitt did not raise it until after the cert

11

petition had been granted.
QUESTION:

12

13

I

But,

Mr. Sigman, what provision of ERISA

did the respondent violate?

14

MR. SIGMAN:

We contend that the respondent,

15

Hewitt, violated -- that -- that the violation involved

16

was the violation of the fiduciaries to adequately fund

17

the plan.

18

because it is an open-ended provision, to provide relief

19

against Hewitt for aiding and abetting the fiduciaries in

20

that violation.

21
22

23
24
25

And we contend that 502(a)(3) is broad enough,

QUESTION:

And what's the section of ERISA that

the fiduciary violated?
MR. SIGMAN:

What would we look to?
That would be section 404 and 409,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

404 and 409?

MR. SIGMAN:

1

Right.

Section 404 broadly sets

2

forth the fiduciary standards of ERISA and 409 is the

3

provision of the act which provides for an action against

4

fiduciaries on behalf of the plan.
Congress provided in section 502(a)(3) of ERISA

5
6

that pension plan participants and beneficiaries could

7

recover, in addition to the remedies explicitly set forth

8

in that section, other appropriate equitable relief to

redress ERISA violations.

there's -- that doesn't go to the relief, it goes to where

encompassed within the adjective, within the term

18

equitable relief, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes, so -- so you might as well have

dropped the adjective.
MR. SIGMAN:

Well, I don't think so, Your Honor,

22

because equitable relief traditionally has encompassed

23

make-whole relief in situations such as this.

24

Beneficiaries of a trust who are wronged by the

12

MR. SIGMAN:

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. SIGMAN:

I'm sorry to disappoint the Court.

As this Court has stated in the

15

Firestone case, ERISA's legislative history further

16

demonstrates that Congress had intended Federal courts to

17

develop Federal common law in fashioning the additional

18

appropriate equitable relief described in section 502.

19

The legislative history also demonstrates that Congress

20

intended to engraft traditional trust law principles into

21

ERISA's remedial scheme.

22

Moreover, a fundamental concept of trust law is

23

that courts will give to the beneficiaries of a trust

24

those remedies which are necessary to - - for the

25

protection of their interests.

And it's also a

(800) FOR DEPO

1

fundamental concept and principle of trust law that a

2

knowing participant in a breach of fiduciary duty is as

3

responsible as the fiduciary for the breach.

4

In this particular case, the relief which we

5

urged the Court to approve is essential in order to

6

fulfill the act's remedial purposes, among the most

7

important being to deter fiduciary breaches which

8

frequently could not happen without the assistance of a

9

knowing participant in that breach.
In addition, as I've stated earlier, the

10
11

fundamental and most important remedial feature of ERISA

12

is to assure the interests of retirees in the pension

13

benefits that they were promised under the terms of the

14

plan.

15

knowing participants would thereby further ERISA's

16

remedial goals.

17

nonfiduciary might have to assist or to induce a fiduciary

18

to breach his ERISA responsibilities.

QUESTION:

Let -- let me ask you, Mr. Sigman, if

21

I may, section 409(a) talks about the liability of -- of a

22

fiduciary.

Is that correct?

MR. SIGMAN:

relief as the court may deem appropriate.
MR. SIGMAN:

That's correct.

And I think that

3

40 , Your Honor, also demonstrates that that relief can

4

encompass monetary relief.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SIGMAN:

Well -Because the --at the beginning of

7

the section it says "shall be personally liable to make

8

good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from
each such breach."

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SIGMAN:

12

13
14

And -"And to restore to such plan any

profits" -QUESTION:

But it's -- it's phrased in the -- in

the disjunctive there.

15

MR. SIGMAN:

16

QUESTION:

Is -- is that correct?
Yes, it is, Your Honor.

And then 502(a), section (1)(3), if

17

the civil action brought by a participant benefit a

18

fiduciary, that can be brought to obtain other appropriate

1

equitable relief.

20

MR. SIGMAN:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.
So that in one -- in 50

it talks

22

about equitable or remedial relief, then this section

23

talks about appropriate equitable relief.

24

Congress was really being careful in the terms it used?

2

the phrase "equitable or remedial relief," I don't really

equitable and remedial.

It sounds -- I believe that it's a

But I do think, despite the sloppiness

10

in the drafting of the statute, that 409 does establish

11

that it's appropriate to seek relief which would provide

12

all losses or restore all losses lost to the plan.

14
15

In the 1989 OBRA amendment to ERISA, which added
a new subsection, 502(1), Congress -QUESTION:

17

the -- the breach of fiduciary obligation, not exactly

negligence but the work of the actuary in combination with

the fiduciary, caused the plan to be underfunded.

Your claim is that

That's correct, Your Honor.
And is the relief that you're asking

22

for that those individuals should pay the amount of the

underfunding into the plan?

24
25

MR. SIGMAN:

Actually, it -- it could go beyond

just the amount of the underfunding into the plan.

seeking to - - relief which would make the plan whole.

And, in other words, we're seeking relief that would

result in a full benefit, a full retirement benefit, as

originally provided for in the terms of the plan, to the

retirees of the plan.

What I'm trying to find out, if you

5

can tell me just in rough figures, is by how much was the

6

plan underfunded, which I suppose would measure the

7

aggregate potential liability in this kind of a lawsuit?

8

9

MR. SIGMAN:

Once again, it's not in the record,

but the best answer I can give you is that in the context

10

of the litigation, the PBGC produced what it called a

11

termination report, indicating that the losses to the plan

12

were in excess of $50 million.

13

QUESTION:

MR. SIGMAN:

And the actuary would be liable for

the fiduciaries.

$50 million.

MR. SIGMAN:

Correct.

The company itself,

Kaiser, was also, we contended, a fiduciary of the plan.

But given the fact that Kaiser was in bankruptcy, we did

not bring suit against Kaiser originally.

I wanted to point out to the Court that the OBRA argument

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. MANN

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether ERISA

6

7

deprived beneficiaries of their traditional equitable

8

remedies against parties who knowingly participate in a

9

breach of trust.

In our view, the answer is found in the

10

text of section 502(a)(3), which authorizes courts to

11

award appropriate equitable relief to redress violations

12

of ERISA and ERISA plans.
Although compensatory damages normally are

13
14

considered legal relief, it is clear in the trust context

15

that equitable relief includes a right to compensatory

16

relief which accordingly should be available under section

17

502(a)(3).

18

indications from related provisions of the statute, as

19

well as the practical consequences of a contrary reading.

20

That reading of the statute is bolstered by

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, if you go to the subsection

21

immediately before the one you're talking about, section

22

502(a)(1)(2), I guess, is where it talks about "A civil

action may be brought by the Secretary or by a participant

24

for appropriate relief under section 1109."

11

most obvious meaning of - - of the word in context is those

things that are not equitable, which is the legal relief

at the types of things that are legal relief and are not

equitable relief, they are actions that would lie solely

that when Congress drafted section 409 for remedies

equitable relief but also the very limited types of legal

Now, at common law the understand --

before ERISA, the understanding was we can't expect the

plan sustains as a result of a breach, restoring profits

note that at common law only trustees were in a fiduciary

relationship with a trust and its beneficiaries.

ERISA, on the other hand, not only are the trustees in a

fiduciary relationship with the trust, but ERISA deems any

be - - I didn't understand from the briefs, quite frankly,

2

but in response to my last question to Mr. Mann, he said

3

the provision of the subchapter that they said was

4

violated was 404.

and so forth,

10

And that -- you then read 502(a) is

"to enjoin any act or practice that violates
"and to

"appropriate equitable

Now, why can't that -- why can't "appropriate

11

equitable relief" in such an action include conspirators

12

with the fiduciary?

13

MR. FRANKEL:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FRANKEL:

For two reasons.

One --

Ignoring 409 entirely.
Ignoring -- ignoring 409.

What --

16

what -- what ERISA says is that a person is either, in

17

essence, a fiduciary or not a fiduciary.

18

ERISA expands the universe of fiduciaries, it says that

19

only fiduciaries can be held liable for losses sustained

20

by the plan, while working a concomitant reduction on what

21

relief can be obtained from nonfiduciaries.

22

And given that

And to accept a conspiracy or other theory, one

23

would have to conclude that by conspiring with the plan

fiduciaries, then in essence --

MR. FRANKEL:

2

QUESTION:

-- That they became a fiduciary.

Well either you have to conclude that

3

or conclude that Congress meant by the words appropriate

4

relief, relief that would have been appropriate under

5

common law precedents.

6

MR. FRANKEL:

7

That is a possible interpretation.

That is one with which we strongly disagree.

8

QUESTION:

You disagree, of course.

9

MR. FRANKEL:

And I think the whole structure of

10

the statute shows that Congress didn't decide to take the

11

common law of trusts and the exclusive jurisdiction of

12

equity courts and import that into ERISA.

13

QUESTION:

What is your position on the

14

preemption question that Justice Kennedy asked earlier?

15

Does a cause of action remain against the actuary at --

16

under State law, or has it been preempted?

17

MR. FRANKEL:

That -- that issue has not been

18

presented to this Court before, as to whether actions

19

against nonfiduciary service providers are preempted.

20

QUESTION:

Do you have a position on the

21

question -- I know it hasn't -- and I know it isn't before

22

us, but it affects our thinking.

23

MR. FRANKEL:

However, this Court may conclude

24

if it holds, as we think it should, that money damages are

25

not encompassed with appropriate equitable relief, that it

would agree with the district court in this case, in an

2

appropriate case, that professional malpractice claims or

3

common law tort claims against nonfiduciary service

4

providers may not be preempted by ERISA.

QUESTION:

ERISA cases coming out our ears these days.

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, Mr. Frankel, is it -- we have

And I'm glad to find that there's a

section here that is crystal clear.

10

(Laughter.)

11

QUESTION:

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

Or at least allegedly so.

Mr. Frankel, clarify your last

14

answer.

15

common law State action against nonfiduciaries based on

16

trust obligations are precluded.

17

MR. FRANKEL:

18
19

You -- you are of the position that any -- any

I believe that that is a -- is --

would be consistent with existing law, although -QUESTION:

The only thing you're conceding is

20

that there may be some tort claims against them or some

21

extra trust claims remaining.

22

MR. FRANKEL:

Extra trust claims.

I mean, what

23

obligations are imposed by the statute on fiduciary --

24

nonfiduciary service providers?

25

strong argument that claims based on that would be

I think there would a

preempted.
QUESTION:

2

Of course, the question will be

whether that action relates to an ERISA plan, the way this
4

Court's been construing this.

5

•

MR. FRANKEL:

I -- I agree with you, Justice

6

Stevens.

However, whether common law tort claims or other

7

claims against nonfiduciary service providers fall within

8

the conspicuous breadth of ERISA's preemption clause is

9

really a matter that Congress may ultimately have to

10

decide.

If, for example, this Court were to conclude in

11

an appropriate case that such common law claims against

12

nonfiduciaries would be preempted and would leave people

13

without a place to go to get the money damages they might

14

otherwise be entitled to, but with which they cannot

15

obtain it under ERISA.

16
17

If there are no further questions, I have
nothing further.

Thank you.

QUESTION:

19

Mr. Sigman, you have 2 minutes remaining.

MR. SIGMAN:

25

The case --we submit the case,

Your Honor.

22
23

Thank you, Mr. Frankel.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Very well. The case is

submitted.
(Whereupon, at 2:52 p.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
