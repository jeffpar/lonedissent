ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns the relative priority of a

3

Federal tax lien and a private state law lien as to a

4

specific piece of real property that was acquired by the

5

debtor after the date the Federal tax lien was filed.

6

is after-acquired property in that sense.

7

The relevant facts can be summarized simply.

8

The Federal tax liens at issue in this case arose on

9

December 29,

986 at the time the taxes against the debtor

20

were assessed.

21

its judgment against the debtors.

22

state law constituted a lien against the debtors' real

23

property, then owned and after-acquired.

notice of Federal tax lien.

after that on September 23, 1987 the debtors acquired the

^

subject property known as the South Street property, the

3

right to which are at issue in this case.

4

The order therefore was the Federal tax lien

6

Federal tax lien was filed, and then the debtors acquired

7

the property.

8

has priority as to that piece of after-acquired property.

9

•'

And the question is whether the IRS's lien

The general rule as to the priority of a Federal

10

tax lien is that a Federal tax lien has priority over all

11

competing interests unless at the time the Federal tax

12

lien arose the competing interest was specific and

13

perfected.

14

the Federal tax lien can only take so much of the property

15

as is the debtors' and if at the time the Federal tax lien

16

arises some other lien has come and essentially grabbed a

17

part of that property, the Federal tax lien can only take

18

the balance of the interest that was the debtors'.

19

The rationale, I think, of that rule is that

Now, there are exceptions to that rule and one

20

of the exceptions is section 6323(a), and that provides

21

that a Federal tax lien is not valid against a judgment

22

lien until the Federal tax lien is filed.

23

claims that in this case, this case arises, he is entitled

24

to the benefit of 6323 (a) , and the effect of that

25

provision therefore is just to move the date from the date

Now respondent

1

of assessment, from the date the tax lien arises on which

2

you determine priorities, to move the date until the date

3

the tax lien was filed, which in this case was September

4

9,

987.

5

I think there are thus two issues in this case.

6

The primary question and the one that the court of appeals

7

got wrong was whether the debtors' interest was specific

8

and perfected as of September 9,

9

mean, in our view the lienholder's interest was not

987.

In our view, I

10

specific and perfected as of that date, and accordingly

11

the tax lien would have priority.
There is a second question which the court of

12

3

appeals didn't rely on, but I think maybe the district

4

court did, and that is whether the fact that the Federal

5

tax lien attached to the property at the same time as the

6

state tax, as the judgment lien, whether that alters the

7

result that would follow from a finding that the state

8

lien wasn't specific and perfected as of the date of

9

filing of the Federal tax lien.
QUESTION:

20

May I ask, Mr. Feldman, now, if we

21

weren't dealing with after-acquired property but had a

22

judgment lien on all property of the debtor, would you

23

think a subsequently filed Federal lien would take

24

priority?

25

MR. FELDMAN:

If, well, I think that that is

1

exactly what this Court decided in the case of United

2

States against Vermont.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, I thought so too.

4

MR. FELDMAN:

And the issue in that case was

5

whether a lien is sufficiently specific, that is if it

6

just identifies all of the debtor's property rather than

7

giving a specific legal description of the property.

8

9

QUESTION:

That's pretty specific, if it

attaches to all.

10

MR. FELDMAN:

11

that was sufficiently specific.

12

is derived from Vermont is whether, on the date of filing

13

of the Federal tax lien whether, if you can determine on

14

that date that a particular piece of property was subject

15

to the judgment lien, then it was specific and perfected

16

on that date.

17

Right.

And this Court held that
And I think the task that

If you can't --

QUESTION:

Well, is it enough that you can say

18

it's clear that any subsequently acquired property will be

19

immediately covered by the judgment lien?

20

that it would be, isn't it?

21
22

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, I don't think -- there's no

question under state law that judgment lien --

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. FELDMAN:

25

And it is clear

is a problem.

So specificity isn't a problem.
Right.

We don't think specificity

The problem is that under the settled task

for whether a judgment lien is specific and perfected is

2

whether the identity of the lien or the amount of the lien

3

and the property subject to the lien were established.

4

In this case the property subject to the lien

5

was not established as Of the date on which you measure

6

the priorities, which is September 9, 1987.

7
8

QUESTION:

Well, whose lien attached first in

your view, or were they simultaneous?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, that actually gets to the

10

second question I mentioned.

Both liens attached to the

11

property at the same time, but there's nothing hinges on

12

when the Federal lien attached to the property.

13

turns on, the question is whether as of the date of notice

14

whether the state lien had already attached to the

15

property.

And since, in our view since it hadn't --

Yes, primarily.

And does the creditor have the

22

judgment lien credit or have any reliance interest on

23

property subsequently acquired, do you think?

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think he does.

1

Congress did in 1966 when it overhauled the statute and

2

passed the Tax Lien Act, it specifically dealt with the

3

question of after-acquired property and it looked at all

4

the types of after-acquired property and types of security

5

interests and made a narrow exception to the general rule

6

of Federal priority as of the date of notice was filed, a

7

narrow exception to that rule for certain kinds of

8

commercial financing transactions, only as to certain

9

kinds of property, and only for a limited period of time,

10
11

that is 45 days after the tax lien was filed.
QUESTION:

If there had been no Federal

12

Government here but we had a situation of private parties,

13

what would be the result under the Uniform Commercial Code

14

of state law generally for after-acquired property?

15

MR. FELDMAN:

It's a little bit hard to answer

16

that question because the Federal Tax Lien, I'm not sure

17

what, how, that is not something that is governed by the

18

Uniform Commercial Code.

20

lender or the interest of an inventory financier or an

21

accounts receivable financier, just the parties who are

22

protected by the Tax Lien Act.

23

UCC as a general matter, although it's quite complex,

24

would have priority over a judgment lien creditor as to

25

the after-acquired property.

There would be some interest in

Those interests under the

But, on the other hand, a Federal tax lien

1
2

itself is not subject to the UCC and it's difficult to say

3

what, there's no, really no other way to answer that

4

question.

QUESTION:

on when the Federal tax lien was perfected?

7
8

Is your argument that nothing turns

MR. FELDMAN:

Nothing turns on when it attached,

and I think that follows from a number of --

QUESTION:

Well, is that the same as perfected?

MR. FELDMAN:

10

Yes, I think that's part of

perfection.

lien, and the property subject to the lien was

this particular lien had taken hold of this particular

property.

If you look at the test for perfection it's

QUESTION:

So everything turns on when the

19

judgement creditor's lien perfected, but nothing turns on

20

when the Government's lien was perfected?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

The relevant thing you do

22

is take, what you do is you take a snap shot of the

23

situation as of, in ordinary cases as of the date the

24

Federal taxes were assessed, but in cases under 6323(a) at

25

the date that the tax lien was filed.

You take a snap

1

shot of that situation and say as of that date had the

2

judgment lien attached to the property at, was a definite

3

amount, was the identity of the lienholder specific.

4

it wasn't, then the tax lien takes the property and the

5

judgment lien is junior to it.

If

If it had already attached to that property and

6

7

was established as of that date that that particular piece

8

of property was subject to the lien, then that lien would

9

be superior to the Federal tax lien.
QUESTION:

10

What happens with the proceeds in a

11

title company?

12

superior to the Government because its lien was perfected

13

before the assessment and before notice of the lien, and

14

then the property is sold and money is sitting in the

15

escrow company.

16

that money, or is this after-acquired property so that the

17

Government's subsequent lien could now attach and be

18

superior?

Suppose the judgment lien creditor is

Does the judgment creditor's lien follow

MR. FELDMAN:

The question there would be

20

whether you trace the proceeds of the property, whether

the lien on the property attaches also -- you trace the

priorities through to the proceeds.

1

here had been purchased with an exchange of other real

2

property to which the judgment creditor's lien had

3

attached, then surely it would carry over to the South

4

Street property, would it not?

5

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

I would think it would.

6

In this case it wasn't, the debtor had no rights in the

7

South Street property to which the judgment lien could

8

attach as of September 9.

9

QUESTION:

Well, how was the, what was the

10

consideration for the acquisition of the South Street

11

property?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

The debtor had previously owned

13

the property and had sold the property.

14

essentially what amounts to a mortgage, except that under

15

Utah state law in this circumstance it was considered an

16

interest in real property, in personal property and not

17

real property.

18

QUESTION:

19

lien didn't attach?

20

He had

And therefore the judgment creditor

MR. FELDMAN:

It didn't attach because it was

21

personal property at that time and the judgment lien only

22

attaches under state law to real property.

23

when that interest became a real property interest of the

24

debtors, which was on September 23, after the Federal tax

25

lien was filed, it was only then that the judgment lien

It was only

attached to the property.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Feldman, in a case of

3

simultaneous perfection do you take the position that

4

6323(a) breaks the tie?

5

MR. FELDMAN:

I think our position is that, if

6

you mean a case of simultaneous attachment, if we're

7

talking specifically about that type of perfection --

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

It would be our view that both the

10

amendments, the clear intent of the amendments which is to

11

limit the extent of a security interest in after-acquired

12

property for a period of 45 days and only in certain given

13

cases which did not include judgment liens, it would be

14

our position that both that and 6323(a) and (c) , I'm

15

sorry, 6321 and 6323(a), all of those support our

16

position.

17

6321, which is the basic rule, says that the

18

Federal tax lien arises at the time the taxes are

19

assessed.

20

assessed or attached, whichever is later, or if there is

21

some kind of perfection that it arises at a different

22

time.

23

for Federal law the Federal tax lien arises at the date

24

the taxes are assessed.

25

It doesn't say at the time the taxes are

That states a Federal rule that for purposes of,

Now, 6323(a) switches that, moves that, just

1

simply moves that date back to the date that the notice is

2

filed, but you still do the same thing on that date that

3

you would do in one of the other cases under 632 , which

4

is you look as of that date as to whether the judgment

5

lien had attached.

6

QUESTION:

What does that tell you about

7

simultaneity, when two of them attach at precisely the

8

same moment?

9
10

MR. FELDMAN:

I guess, I think the import of our

argument is that the date that the Federal tax lien
attaches in an after-acquired property case is not a

12

legally significant date, that Congress set those legally

3

significant dates as being either when they're assessed or

4

when the tax lien is filed.

5

a later date is not legally significant.

6

Congress considered the after-acquired property issue, in

7

all cases of after-acquired property you're going to have

8

situations similar to this in which the state lien and the

9

Federal lien, or the judgment lien and the tax lien attach

20
21

The fact that it attached at
And in fact when

at the same moment to the property.
Congress wanted to limit the cases in which a

22

private party could have superiority over the Federal tax

23

lien among those cases of after-acquired property in very

24

limited ways, only for a period of 45 days, for example.

25

If the court of appeals were right here the judgment

1

creditor has a far superior interest to those the Congress

2

specifically wanted to give priority to in the Tax Lien

3

Act because the judgment lien would be good indefinitely

4

for after-acquired property.

5

this case it was 2 weeks, but if the debtor had acquired

6

the property a year later under the court of appeals'

7

opinion the result would have been exactly the same.
And I don't think that's consistent with what

8

9

If the debt -- it's true in

was Congress' decision to limit very carefully the classes

10

of after-acquired property that would have, as to which a

11

private creditor would have superiority over the Federal

12

lien.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Feldman, are you talking about

14

Congress' decision -- you're talking about the 1966

15

decision?

16

MR. FELDMAN:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, because that's where it --

Is it your view that the law with

18

respect to the issue that's before us today changed in

19

1966?

20

MR. FELDMAN:

21

QUESTION:

No, it's not.

I think --

So we really, the 1966 act really

22

does shed any light on the problem that we have before us,

23

does it?

24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, let me put it this way.

I

^

So you don't need to rely on it.
I don't have to rely on that, but

4

I do think Congress then enacted those amendments in 1966

5

in reliance on that.

6

^

this case was clear long before 1966.

QUESTION:

In other words you're relying on what

7

you perceive to be Congress' understanding in 1966 as to

8

what the law then was?

9

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct.

10

by enacting the statute that it did in 1966 it really

11

adopted that prior law, and the exceptions to the rules

12

about after-acquired that it enacted in 1966 wouldn't make

13

any sense if it turned out that other, all kinds of other

14

security interests other than the ones Congress named had

15

a priority over the Federal lien that was so much more

16

substantial than the priority that Congress chose to give

17

the particular classes of creditors.

QUESTION:

Where do you first quote the 1966

statute in your briefs or cert petition?

MR. FELDMAN:

4

I think there is another line of cases

QUESTION:

Oh, I had the wrong brief.

Yes,

thank you.

5

MR. FELDMAN:

There's another line of cases that

6

also suggests the same result, and that is this Court has

7

never specifically addressed a case involved after-

8

acquired property but it has addressed cases involving a

9

very closely analogous situation, and that is what might

10

be called after-acquired debt or after-incurred debt.
In the cases of United States against Pioneer

11

12

American Insurance, United States against Equitable Life

13

Insurance, those cases involved mortgages that included

14

clauses providing that if the mortgage was foreclosed that

15

the attorneys' fees for the foreclosure would be added to

16

the principal amount of the debt due secured by the

17

property.

18

after-incurred debt, a debt that is added on to the

19

secured amount.

20

fees were incurred after the Federal tax lien was filed,

21

and in both of those cases this Court held that that

22

after-incurred debt, that the security interest as to that

23

after-incurred debt was junior to that of the Federal tax

24

What was the reasoning in those

Would interest that accrued later be junior to?
MR. FELDMAN:

You know, I'm not sure what the

5

rule was before 1966 as to interest.

6

1966 Congress specifically provided for interest and

7

actually provided for some other kinds of costs that were

8

attendant, for instance on a mortgage, to be included in

9

the principal amount as a specific exception to the

10
11

I believe that in

general rule.
But the point was that these after-incurred

12

debts in this Court, this Court decided in two different

13

decisions that these after-incurred debts, even if they

14

were relatively certain in amount and relatively certain

15

to be incurred, that the security interest as to those

16

debts was junior to the Federal tax lien.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. FELDMAN:

What was the reasoning of the Court?
It was applying the test for

19

perfection that I have suggested here, which is, in those

20

cases the amount of the debt - - you remember the test

21

requires the identity of the lienholder, the amount of the

22

debt, and the property subject to the debt be established.

It seems a rather strange ruling.

Well,

Congress did

take care of some of those situations elsewhere in the

amendments in provisions other than those that I was

talking about before.

the date of filing, therefore the interest in that,

that

10

after-incurred debt was not superior to the Federal tax

lien, there's no reason why the court of appeals ruling

12

that after-acquired property should be treated any better.

13

I think those cases provide a close analogy to the

14

decision that should be reached here.

that if the South Street property had been owned by the

debtor here at the time that the judgment lien was filed

Yes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF T. RICHARD DAVIS

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. DAVIS:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

12

In 1827 Justice John Marshall enunciated what

13

was, he deemed, a cardinal rule, which was a prior lien

14

gives a prior claim entitled to prior satisfaction from

15

the subjected binds.

doctrine of first in time as first in right, and it has

competing lien claims.

20

the competing liens between a Federal tax lien and certain

21

competing liens as provided in section 6323.

This has become known as the

This has also been adopted and

and make a singular issue presented to this Court.

2

is will this Court apply the first in time rule in favor

3

of a prior perfected judgment lien over a subsequently

filed Federal tax lien when property purchased by the, as

5

against property purchased by the debtor subsequent to all

6

the liens, the after-acquired issue.

7

The facts are not in dispute.

That

It is important

8

to note that Zions Bank did everything that was required

9

of it to perfect under state law a general lien on all

10

real property owned by the debtor located in the County of

11

Salt Lake.

12

Section 6232 does not explicitly resolve the

13

issue of after-acquired property, but it provides the

tl

14

framework which, very compatibly with prior decisions of

^

15

this Court and with the intentions of Congress as shown

16

since the institution of the Federal tax lien in 1866,

17

allows a consistent pattern of recognizing the integrity

18

of a judicial judgment lien obtained by a private party.

19

QUESTION:

The Government's argument, Mr. Davis,

20

as I understand it, is that the property used to purchase

21

the South Street property was property to which the

22

judgment creditor's lien did not attach under Utah law.

23

Do you dispute that?

I do not.

That is correct.

Not pursuant -- that is correct as

5

parties have, they abandon whatever rights they had to any

property of Mr. McDermott, or any rights they had to this

7

property until the property was repurchased by McDermott

at the foreclosure sale.

Then both liens attached to that

property simultaneously.

The question is whether the

prior entry of the judgment lien has any effect at all as

against a subsequent filing of the notice of tax lien.

12

believe it does.
The choateness doctrine, as it has been declared
by this Court, was codified by the Treasury Department in

its regulations.

has stated, a requirement of the establishment of the

amount of the lien, the identity or the lienor, and the

different, and I agree, but I think this is not an

illogical step to say that a general lien which is

12

commercial law is regarded to be the perfection of a lien.

13

I think just the common law understanding is that the lien

14

doesn't attach until the property is identified, and

15

that's why the provision of the Uniform Commercial Code

16

containing an after-acquired property clause was a real

innovation, because it was generally understood in the

common law that you can't attach until you know what the

It's simply --

MR. DAVIS:

I believe that's the case with the

2

property which is covered by a lien is subject to that

10

QUESTION:

As far as real property it stays and is

I understand, of course the UCC

11

applies only to personal property, but what I'm suggesting

12

is that it made an innovation with respect to personal

13

property, and that the old law with respect to personal

property was the same as the old law with respect to real

property, that you don't have a perfected lien until you

MR. DAVIS:

That did not affect the lien, but it

gave, Zions had knowledge that that would be coming into,

9

that the property would be coming into Mr. McDermott's

10

hands because of the nature and the assessing of the

Reliance was important to a judgment

against a party will not pursue that party if he knows the

1

obtaining property either through foreclosure or gift or

2

devise or some such way, there would be a reliance that

3

was exercised on the half of that judgment lien creditor.

4

QUESTION:

But how does that fit into the

5

congressional statute here, the fact that the competing

6

judgment lien creditor may have relied on the judgment

7

debtor to eventually acquire property?
MR. DAVIS:

8

9

I think the statute is silent as to

after-acquired property.

I think the framework which

10

allows the recognition of a general lien is as far as we

11

can go in looking at the statute to find whether this will

12

fit within the choateness doctrine.

13

QUESTION:

14

anything to do with reliance.

15

MR. DAVIS:

I didn't know that choateness had

I think the reason for, the

16

choateness doctrine requires that the lien be, that the

17

lienor be identified, the amount be ascertained, and the

18

property be established.

19

so that anyone else can rely upon what that lien is all

20

about.

21

upon the actions of other entities.

22

Congress, not only in 1966 but beginning in 1913 and again

23

in 1939, began not to cut back on private competitors with

24

Federal tax liens, rather to allow those liens to compete

25

fairly as on an equal footing with the Federal tax lien.

I believe the reason for that is

time of perfection in either lien or both liens is

3

important in any case, whether it's before or after the

If that

Basically what we have here is a secret lien of the

placed by a private lien claimant.
I believe that the congressional intent clearly,

13

under 1966 acts and prior to that as reviewed by various

14

Federal courts, states that the purpose of that act was

15

merely to put them on equal footing and encourage both

I

think the statute says that.

comment a little bit on what, why you would say if there

were a tie you wouldn't somehow or other share the

proceeds or something, but rather would give the

MR. FELDMAN:

And I wonder could you

Yeah, I mean, there's two, I think

there's two distinct questions there.

really is a tie would be a case, I would regard a case as

9

for instance the Fifth Circuit case, the Southern Rock

One is where there

10

case, where there really was simultaneously with the

11

Federal filing there was a state filing, and that would be

12

a real tie case.

3

I think the underlying rationale, even in a case

4

like that the Government should win, because I think the

5

underlying rationale is that unless the prior, is that the

6

Federal tax lien is a very potent form of lien and unless

7

at the time the Federal tax lien either arises or is

8

filed, if at that moment the other lien hasn't already

9

taken the property the Federal tax lien is what attaches

20
21
22

23
24
25

to the debtor's property and has a superior interest then.
QUESTION:

But this is, there's no specific

statutory provision addressing the question, is there?

I think that you could read the

word until in 6323(a) to accomplish that.

That would be one way to put it.

Well, that's the only, that's what

you're claiming.

MR. FELDMAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

Otherwise there would be a tie.
I think the question of when our

9

lien attached to the property is not a legally, there's

10

nothing that makes that a legally significant question.

11

If it -- then that is really to say the same thing as the

12

date of attachment was as of the date that it was filed,

13

or in the case that didn't come within one of the 6323(a)

14

exceptions it would be when the Federal tax lien arises,

15

which Congress provided was the date of assessment.

QUESTION:

Government's Federal tax lien in September attach to the

South Street property when the earlier July lien didn't?

QUESTION:

So when did your lien take effect?

MR. FELDMAN:

Our lien attached to the property

on, at the same time as respondents', on September 23,

11

1987, but the priority of the Federal lien should be

12

determined as of the date of filing.

priority of the United States, as is the case with many of

11

the exceptions in the Tax Lien Act and elsewhere in the

12

UCC when you're dealing with prior, with private

creditors, it is frequently the case that the priority is

not measured from the date of attachment but is measured
