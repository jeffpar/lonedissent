ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL 0. FREEMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. FREEMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case has been called a plain touch, a plain

11
12

feel, or plain view case.

13

aside, this Court must decide whether police officers in

14

the field, under a variety of circumstances, may continue

15

using all their experience, all of their knowledge, and

16

all of their senses in arriving at probable cause

17

determinations.

18

But when all the labels are set

In this case, Officer Vernon Rose conducted a

19

limited, careful, and reasonable protective pat search

20

that was well within the limits of the Terry v. Ohio

21

doctrine.

22

QUESTION:

Well, do you agree that, at least on

23

the officer's testimony, it was possible for the State

24

Supreme Court to find, as it did, that he went beyond the

25

pat search for weapons?

I presume the point of their

analysis was that whatever this lump was that he felt, it

2

was perfectly obvious that it wasn't a gun or a knife or

3

some kind of a weapon, and that he went a little bit

4

further to see if he could figure out what it was.

5

agree that the court could at least place that

6

interpretation on the testimony?

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, the court could

8

have, but we believe the court erred.

10

Do you

The facts for the

Well don't -- don't we normally take

11

our facts from the State -- the State courts or the courts

12

from which the appeals are taken?

13

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, you do, Your Honor.

But we

14

believe that the facts in the trial court, in the Supreme

15

Court were the same, but the Minnesota Supreme Court used

16

the wrong legal standard, the subjective standard, to - -

17

in which to arrive at its conclusion of the facts.

18

subjective standard -QUESTION:

19

If the

Well, what was subjective about its

20

concluding that the officer had gone -- based on the

21

officer's own testimony, had gone beyond what was

22

necessary to determine whether there was a weapon there or

23

not.

Rose's testimony.

I would refer the Court to page 2 of

MR. FREEMAN:

-- The facts in the transcript

were very limited in terms his testimony.

7

lump in the front pocket.

and it slid and it felt to be lump of crack cocaine in

10

He said,

"As I

I examined it with my fingers

If he --

QUESTION:

Well, he didn't --he didn't claim

11

that he thought the lump might be a weapon.

12

no one -- when I read it, it didn't occur to me that this

13

so-called lump might be a potentia.' weapon, which is what

14

he was authorized to search for under Terry.

15

MR. FREEMAN:

And, I mean,

Your Honor, we believe that the --

16

the facts before -- before the trial court, before the

17

Minnesota Supreme Court, and this Court, support the

18

conclusion at the same time he decided that it was not a

19

weapon, that he knew it was crack cocaine.

20

that he can do that because of his experience as a police

21

officer, because he had seized crack cocaine out of this

22

very same house at 1030 Morgan Avenue, North in

23

Minneapolis on previous occasions, and, in fact, he had

24

arrested suspects with weapons on their person.

25

We suggest

So when he was doing a legitimate Terry stop and

a subsequent search for weapons - QUESTION:

2

Could a reasonable trier of fact

3

conclude that the officer went beyond the bounds of what

4

was necessary in order to determine if the subject had a

5

weapon?

6

MR. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, a reasonable trier of

7

fact could make that conclusion, but we believe since the

8

Minnesota Supreme Court used the subjective standard

9

rejected in Horton, that that so colored their judgment

10

that they did not provide the proper analysis.

11

I would point to the Court - -

12

QUESTION:

Well did -- would you agree, then,

13

that a police officer cannot, in conducting a Terry frisk,

14

go beyond what is necessary to make the determination that

15

the subject does or does not have a weapon?

16

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, Your Honor, the limits of the

17

Terry search say that that is a search strictly for - - is

18

a search for weapons.

19

fact, if -- at the time he decided it was not a weapon,

20

that that search must stop.

21

QUESTION:

And it -- the position is that, in

So the conduct of the search cannot

22

extend beyond the object of the search, beyond the purpose

23

of the search.

24

MR. FREEMAN:

25

Your Honors, we're suggesting that Officer Rose,

That is correct.

1

using his knowledge and experience in touching the suspect

2

in the front of his thin nylon jacket, reasonably

3

concluded, with probability, that, in fact, he.had crack

4

cocaine in the pocket and therefore he was authorized to

5

seize it.
And what, I guess, we're suggesting is that the

6

7

Court should confirm what Officers Rose -- Rose's

8

experience and knowledge, and, yes, his hands told him,

9

that at the time he touched this object in the nylon

10

jacket during a protective pat frisk authorized by Terry,

11

that he concluded that it was not a weapon and at the same

12

time contemporaneously decided it was crack cocaine.

13

QUESTION:

Suppose he needs 5 seconds to

14

manipulate the object from the outside of the jacket.

15

that permissible?

16

MR. FREEMAN:

Is

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

17

police officer is entitled to do a thorough and reasonable

18

search for a weapon.
QUESTION:

19

Now, suppose that he's satisfied by

20

touching an object that it's not a weapon.

21

linger for 3 or 4 seconds to determine whether or not it

22

might be contraband?

23

MR. FREEMAN:

Now, can he

Your Honor, he could under the

24

concept of a continuing search based on reasonable

25

suspicion.

in Terry extending to Arizona v. Hicks and subsequently

2

in -- in place, suggested that if, in fact, a reasonable

3

suspicion existed in the minds of the police officer,

4

that, in fact, a limited additional investigation might

5

occur under four criteria.

6

First, the officer --

7

QUESTION:

That would be an extension of our

8

precedents, I take it.

9

MR. FREEMAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FREEMAN:

That would be, Your Honor.

Thank you.
We would suggest that the officer

12

would have to have a right to have his hands there in the

13

first place, have reasonable suspicion that there is an

14

object there, but not yet have reached the level of

15

probable cause, that additional search would have to be

16

limited in scope and duration, it would have to be only to

17

quickly confirm or deny what the object was, and it would

18

have to be within operational necessity.

19

QUESTION:

Would it therefore be appropriate for

20

him to peek into the pocket if he could do that real

21

promptly?

22

MR. FREEMAN:

Your Honor, I don't believe this

23

Court's doctrine, in discussion, of appropriate pat frisks

24

would suggest he could not.

25

QUESTION:

So your answer is yes, that would.

1

MR. FREEMAN:

That's correct.

2

Your Honors, we're suggesting that

3

reasonableness is the touchstone of the Fourth Amendment.

4

It's reasonable for police officers to be able to use all

5

of their sense and all of their experience in arriving at

6

probable cause determinations.

7

This Court recognized in Coolidge the use of

8

sight is an important sense in developing probable cause.

9

This Court, in Johnson, recognized smell through the sense

10

of burning opium as an appropriate probable cause

11

determination, and in Terry itself, this Court recognized

12

that the sense of touch is an important determination to

13

decide whether or not a suspect has a weapon.

14

In short, this Court's decisions reflect the

15

common sense and reasonable principle that officers in the

16

field are entitled to use all of their senses to gather

17

information to make the difficult decisions they must

18

make.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Freeman, your objection to the

20

decision below is that they said you cannot use feel, that

21

that can never be the basis for a probable cause

22

determination.

23
24
25

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes.

That's one of them, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, what is it addition?

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

Suppose I

1

agree with you on that, but I also think that even -- even

2

if he was using feel permissibly, there is considerable

3

question whether he felt beyond what -- beyond the feel

4

that was necessary in order to determine that this wasn't

5

a weapon and therefore violated the Fourth Amendment.

6

What do I do?

Is the case remanded or what?

7

MR. FREEMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, Your Honor --

I mean I don't see -- I don't see why

you should win so long as there is some possibility, as

10

Justice Souter indicated, that the manipulation of the

11

thing he felt was -- was more than was necessary to

12

determine that it wasn't a weapon.

13

MR. FREEMAN:

Well, Your Honor, that goes r:ight

14

back to the Minnesota Supreme Court's mischaracterization

15

of the facts.

16

because they were focusing solely on what was in the mind

17

of the officer and not his objective -- objective actions,

18

that they were so colored in their determination that

19

they, frankly, mischaracterized the evidence.

20

Because they used a subjective standard,

QUESTION:

Well, I'm willing to say that, fine.

21

So let's give them a chance to characterize it correctly.

22

So, I mean, we wouldn't say that the search was valid, we

23

would just say it was not invalid for the reason that the

24

Minnesota court gave.

25

reason, but we don't know because they were using the

It may be invalid for another

1

wrong standard.
MR. FREEMAN:

2

Well, Your Honor, the breadth of

3

the search was not challenged in the district court,

4

was not challenged in the appellate court.

5

in the Minnesota Supreme Court where they used words like

6

"squeeze" and "manipulation."

7

transcript,

8
9

it

It arose first

The officer said in his

"felt and examined."

Now, consider the hypothetical:

a police

officer is frisking a person, he's bent over the police

10

car, and he comes down in a nylon jacket.

11

unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to touch and have

12

to ascertain what it is.

13

"feel" and "examine" are the real words of Officer Rose in

14

the Supreme Court, and that those two verbs are one action

15

that occurred - - that was a brief and a reflex action that

16

occurred at the same time.

17

It is not

And what we're suggesting is

But the Minnesota Supreme Court took those same

18

words.

First,

they reversed them.

They said -- instead

19

of "it slid," they said "slid it," and certainly that is

20

clearly a different concept or connotation of the action

21

that occurred.

22

Court went beyond that in terms of using the subjective

23

standard and focusing only what was in his mind.

24

that the officer was looking for weapons and contraband

25

does not make his search inappropriate.

And then secondly the Minnesota Supreme

The fact

And certainly this Court and a number of other

1

2

courts,

3

contraband in a legitimate Terry search,

4

is not required to ignore that contraband but,

5

can seize it and it will not be suppressed under the

6

Fourth Amendment.

7

in decisions have held that when you find

QUESTION:

that the officer
in fact,

That was set forth in - Well, Mr. Freeman,

I suppose

8

doctrinally you're more interested in - - in having us hold

9

that there such a principle as plain touch.

10

the most important question in the case,

11

MR. FREEMAN:

12

QUESTION:

That's really

isn't it?

Yes, sir.

I know you want to win the case,

13

but -- straight across the board, but you will have won

14

considerably if -- if we held that the Minnesota court was

15

wrong in refusing to recognize plain touch.

16

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, Your'Honor.

And I think it's

17

also a victory for police officers on the street who ought

18

to be able to use all their senses.

Court has already recognized a number of them - -

Is that a correct statement of the law?

MR. FREEMAN:

1

That is a correct statement of the

2

existing law previous to this case, but we believe, Your

3

Honor, that they ought to be able to use all of their

4

senses in all of their criminal act - - in all the work

5

that they do in terms of law enforcement.
QUESTION:

6

I mean --

Well, they can search for weapons,

7

but if -- but if in the course of searching for weapons

8

they touch something that -- that is plainly contraband,

9

they can seize it.

MR. FREEMAN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. FREEMAN:

13

Well, Your -- yes, Your Honor.

That's -- that's your proposition.
That's -- that's what we're

arguing.

14

QUESTION:

Well, it sounds like you're arguing

15

for more, that you're arguing for an extension of Terry

16

and just an outright recognition that officers can search

17

not - - can pat down under Terry not only for weapons but

18

also for drugs.

That's what it sounds like.

22

MR. FREEMAN:

Okay.

Let me - - let me try to be

more precise.

reasonable suspicion theory that I suggested that was

25

already -- that was evolving in this Court's opinions.

I do not believe we have to get to the

We

1

believe probable cause was ascertained at the time the

2

officer reached down, he felt and examined, and he knew at

3

the same time it was not gun but it was crack cocaine.

4

And crack cocaine has got - -

5

QUESTION:

Well, that gets us back to whether we

6

accept the factual findings of the Supreme Court of your

7

State.

8

MR. FREEMAN:

And in -- Your Honor, under Ker v.

9

California this Court can, and has in the past on a number

10

of occasions, disregarded findings of fact that were based

11

on the proper -- improper legal conclusions.

12

below uses the wrong legal standard, that has to impact

13

their judgment.

14

this Court has the right, and has done in the past, to

15

make their own conclusions.

If a court

And in deciding constitutional questions,

16

The facts are quite simple.

17

QUESTION:

But it's simply existing law, is it

18

not, Mr. Freeman, to say that -- and if in conducting a

19

Terry pat down for weapons an officer has -- comes on

20

reasonable suspicion of contraband, he's entitled to seize

21

the contraband.

That's no extension of existing law.

22

MR. FREEMAN:

23

QUESTION:

No, sir, that's not an extension.

Am I right that, in fact, you do not

24

need -- even on your theory, you don't need a new

25

exception to the warrant requirement?

All you need, as I

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

understand it -- and maybe not to win this case, but as

2

Justice White said, doctrinally, all you need is a

3

recognition that the sense of feel can be employed like

4

the sense of sight and smell and so on.

5

And if in the course of what is a - - within the

6

legitimate scope of a Terry search, based on feel and the

7

other senses, an officer reaches the point of having cause

8

to believe that there is contraband there, the officer

9

then can seize the contraband under -- under existing law.

10

Whether it be search incident to arrest --I assume if he

11

had probably cause to believe it was crack, he could

12

arrest him for possession at that point under exigent

13

circumstances, if, for some reason, arrest was not in

14

order.

15

You don't need a new exception to the warrant

16

requirement even on your own claim that feel ought to be

17

recognized as a legitimate source of information.

18

that true?

19

MR. FREEMAN:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Isn't

What

20

we're trying to do is to suggest that an officer can use

21

his sense of feel to develop probable cause.

22

not the critical question about which sense you use to

23

arrive at the conclusion of probable cause, it's whether

24

the standard of probable cause has been met.

use the term, when we say the - - a plain feel doctrine or

2

a plain feel exception, we should not and you are not

3

suggesting that there would be yet another exception to

4

the --to the warrant requirement akin to plain view.

5

What you're really arguing for is simply the -- the

6

recognition that feel is a legitimate source of fact.

7

MR. FREEMAN:

Yes, sir.

8

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

QUESTION:

Don't you find it rather ineffable to

10

determine whether when he felt this little thing, he

11

immediately knew that it -- that it was crack cocaine, or

12

rather before he knew it was crack cocaine he knew it was

13

not a gun and should have stopped thinking right then and

14

moved his hand further on.
I - - is every Fourth Amendment case going to

«

16

come down to this?

17

policemen do a -- do a frisk, they are going to use this

18

-- this doctrine.

I mean I am sure that every time

Why shouldn't we just adopt a clear

19

doctrine that anything you find without strip search,

20

without intruding into pockets and looking underneath the

21

outer garments, is okay, and anything beyond that is not

22

okay?

23

Or else, another clear line doctrine.

That is

24

you can get guns and weapons and anything else you find,

25

you can't use at all.

Wouldn't that be a lot easier?

19

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. SEAMON:

20
21

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

22

The primary issue in this case is whether the

23

sense of touch, like the other senses, may give rise to

24

probable cause when employed in the context of a Terry

25

search.

On that issue we join the State of Minnesota in

1

urging the Court to hold in the affirmative that, yes, the

2

sense of touch, along with the totality of other

3

circumstances, may give rise to probable cause.

4

QUESTION:

One thought that keeps running

5

through my mind is it's perfectly obviously the sense of

6

touch can support that kind of inference, because that's

7

what Terry contemplates is touching looking for weapons.

8

And when you touch and you recognize a weapon, the touch

9

is what you rely on.
MR. SEAMON:

10

That's correct.

And we also think

11

that Terry recognizes that the sort of conduct that is at

12

issue here is simply a natural and necessary part of every

13

protective pat down.

14

a weapon, a police officer needs discretion to be able to

15

momentarily handle items that he runs across in the course

16

of the pat down and can't recognize.
QUESTION:

17

So to determine whether something is

Suppose the officer determines it is

18

not a weapon, may he proceed further to determine whether

19

it's contraband if there is a - - just a few seconds

20

involved and it is not intrusive into the interior of the

21

garment?

22

MR. SEAMON:

No, he may not.

As soon as he

determines that an item is not a weapon, he must move on

and look for something else --

MR. SEAMON:

I'd like to address that issue in

QUESTION:

MR. SEAMON:

Yes.
Our difference is not with the

interpretation by the State Supreme Court of the facts,

7

it's with the legal analysis applied by the State Supreme

Court.

9

refer the Court to page A-7 of the petition appendix which

12

QUESTION:

A-7 of the white cover?

13

MR. SEAMON:

14

The court states as follow:

That's correct.

Page A-7.
"During the course

15

of a frisk, if the officer feels an object that cannot

16

possibly a weapon, the officer is not privileged to poke

17

around to determine what that object is."

18

That's close to being correct, but the flaw in

19

that argument is the assumption that a court can make an

20

after-the-fact determination that an object cannot

21

possibly be a weapon.

22

analysis is it's based on pure hindsight.

9

If you could amend that formulation

that you've read, how would you amend it?
MR. SEAMON:

10

We would say, during the course of

11

a frisk, if the officer feels an object that he knows is

12

not a weapon, the officer is not privileged to poke around

13

to determine what that object is.
QUESTION:

14

I thought that was the subjective --

15

that's the subjective test that the law eschews, is it

not?
MR. SEAMON:

It is a subjective test and we

18

think that in - - in the run of cases such as this one

19

where we are talking about only a brief handling of an

object in a suspect's pocket, the Court should adopt a

What the -- what the State of Minnesota is

Mr. Gorman, do you question the

down an officer develops a reasonable suspicion that the

person being patted down has contraband, he can seize the

contraband?

20

MR. GORMAN:

There are two lines of cases that

21

allow that, Your Honor.

This Court decision in Michigan

22

v. Long allows that, where the officer saw the trunk full

23

of marijuana.

24

from the lower courts, that allow an officer to remove and

25

inspect a hard object of substantial size.

There is also a line of other cases, mostly

And if that

hard, object turns out to be contraband, then the law under

Terry would allow that kind of seizure.

as, I think,

any further.

1

I would answer that, Your Honor, by-

agreeing that under certain circumstances sight may not be

3

the best sense.

4

sight is a better sense.

5

I would say that in most circumstances,

But as to the second part of your question about

6

certainty, I think that when you get down to the facts of

7

this case, Your Honor, it is unreasonable for the officer

8

to conclude that he knew immediately what this minuscule

9

object was.
And I think that that's the problem in

10
11

certainty, because it -- allowing decisions to be made

12

based by the police officer on the sense of certainty is,

13

like Mr. Freeman says, adjudicating the matter on the

14

subjective basis, which this Court has repeatedly declined

15

to do and has said that it should be the objective view.

because it was obviously not a weapon.
There is a third reason why I think that the

4

because it opens up a -- in our view, a serious danger of

6

can't be better shown than on the facts of this case.

7

And that can only better --

The officer testified that he told his partner

subjective view, but that's also a fact of the case.

But there's more pretextual facts in this case.

If you read the record, the officer didn't do a thoroughly

We also believe that the State's position is not

2

a logical extension of plain view.

Plain view -- the

3

plain view cases say that when the officer sees something

4

from a legally -- from a position he's legally entitled to

5

be in, that's not a search.

6

touch is an intrusion and that is, in fact, a search.

7

One of the distinctions between the senses,

We believe, of course, that

8

between the two senses in this case, is that what an

9

officer sees can be seen by others as well to corroborate,

10

but what an officer feels can only be described after he

11

pulls it out of the pocket and writes down in his police

12

report what it is that he saw.

13

QUESTION:

Well, why does that make a

14

difference, Mr. Gorman?

corroboration in the case of a plain view seizure.

16

MR. GORMAN:

Certainly, we don't require

You don't require corroboration,

17

Your Honor.

18

is because it helps to show that the officer did, in fact,

19

see contraband when he sees it, but whereas with the sense

20

of touch, he can't see something, he can only describe

21

what he feels and then pull it out and examine it.

2

as the very small object in this case, touch requires, in

3

our view, more intrusion than sight and more subjective

reasoning rather than objective reasoning.

5

For small objects such

One of the most crucial factual issues in this

case, I think, is the State's claim that the officer

And as a

1

matter of fact, the brief of the solicitor general

2

describes the trial court's order as instantaneous and

3

immediate and that just simply isn't the case.

4

instantaneous and immediate, the trial court would have

5

found that.

And if the trial court --

MR. GORMAN:

QUESTION:

12

I believe we do, Your Honor.
Well, unless the State Supreme Court

doesn't read it that way.
MR. GORMAN:

13

We think what happened here, Your

14

Honor, is that the -- the State Supreme Court applied our

15

clearly erroneous rule, under which it will reexamine

16

factual determinations and overrule trial judges if they

17

think that it was clearly erroneous.

The State Supreme Court relied on the

officer's testimony as to what the officer did.
MR. GORMAN:

And then the court went on to say

that although the officer thought it was immediate, the

25

fact of the matter is that it really wasn't immediate,

that it wasn't instantaneous.

went into its discussion about the officer's manipulation

of the object in the pocket.

4

And that's when the court

But to the extent that the State would have you

5

instantaneous or immediate, that is simply not the case.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GORMAN:

9
10

Mr. Gorman, who was the trial judge?
The trial judge was Robert Lynn,

who argued here 10 years ago in Minnesota v. Murphy.
There is another ambiguity in the record that I

11

also think is worth the Court's consideration, and that is

12

that the officer provided two inconsistent descriptions of

13

the type of outer garment that Mr. Dickerson was wearing.

14

At one point in the record, at page 9, the officer said

15

that it was a "thin nylon jacket."

16

the record, at page 20, the officer said that the jacket

17

was "kind of fluffy," in answer to a question.

18

At another point in

The trial court never resolved that and didn't

19

make any conclusion as to what type of a jacket it was,

20

but that, I think, also goes to the plain view element of

21

the immediate apparency.

22

The sum and substance of this case, for -- as

23

far as -- as far as Mr. Dickerson is concerned, is that

24

what the State is asking you to permit is a second search

25

of the type rejected in Arizona v. Hicks.

In Arizona v.

1

Hicks, the officer had the right to be there but he didn't

2

have the right to lift up the turntable and copy the

3

serial number.

4

This is, in fact, a second search.

The officer,

5

according to our Supreme Court, had the right to make the

6

Terry frisk, but once he determined that there was no

7

weapon present, he didn't have a right to do the

8

additional probing of the content of the pocket in an
effort to try to decide what the object was.

10

Even if the Court concludes that plain feel

11

could, under some circumstances, be adopted, or to use

12

Professor LaFave's language, to be a so-called stepchild

13

of plain view, the facts of this case do not support the

14

adoption of any type of plain view related exception,

15

because of the -- because of the fact that the officer

16

violated Terry in doing the additional search, because of

17

the fact that there was no probable cause, which is

18

plain -- plain view requires, and because of the fact that

1

the object was not immediately apparent.

20

Your Honors, it is our position that if the

21

Court adopts the State's proposed rule here, it will allow

22

police officers to search someone for contraband anytime

23

they think that the Terry criteria might be met.

24

means that any time an officer is in the vicinity of a

25

troubled part of town and sees someone, that they can

That

search that person for drugs rather than for weapons.
We believe that that would be an enormous

expansion of Terry and one that poses severe risks to

ordinary citizens in every city in the country.

ask the Court to keep the bright line where it was at
