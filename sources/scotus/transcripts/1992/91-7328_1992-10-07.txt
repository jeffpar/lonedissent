CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

The case of Leonel Herrera brings to the Court

12

the question of whether or not a person with a colorable

13

claim of innocence is entitled to have a hearing before

14

being executed by the state.

15

QUESTION:

(Inaudible)

16

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, we are not

17

challenging the conviction below, we are basing this

18

submission on - -

QUESTION:

You mean innocence of the death

penalty, so to speak.
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, it's our

22

contention that he should not be executed while he has a

23

colorable claim of innocence, but our submission is based

24

on the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment.

25

QUESTION:

Is it innocence in the sense that he

didn't commit the crime?

2

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

3

QUESTION:

4

So it does go to the guilt and not

just the sentence.
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

5

*

It is, Your Honor.

It does, Your Honor, although

6

in our submission the relief that we request does not seek

7

complete justice at this stage.

8

at this stage that Leonel Herrera may not be executed

9

while he has a colorable claim of innocence.

We are just simply saying

10

sought at this stage is that Judge Hinojosa at the trial

11

level take evidence about our colorable claim of

12

innocence, which he agreed to do, and that process before

13

Judge Hinojosa was aborted by the decision of the Fifth

14

Circuit.
QUESTION:

15

But at bottom you have a claim of

16

innocence of the conviction,

17

merits of the conviction, do you not?
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

18
19

21
22

I mean that goes to the

We do, Your Honor, and

ultimately -QUESTION:

20

So how does the Eighth Amendment bear

on that?
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, the Eighth

23

Amendment only gets us step one.

We respectfully submit

24

that because of the grounds of our claim we in this

25

submission only ask that the state not be allowed to

There's an

He has been found guilty.
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, he was found

17

guilty by a state court and now a Federal judge has ruled

18

that there's a colorable claim of innocence and has sought

19

to proceed.

20

QUESTION:

But the question was not presented to

21

us in the language you have just used, a colorable claim

22

of innocence.

23

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, perhaps there has

24

been some error in that.

1

have to plead first of all innocence and then a Federal

2

district judge has to use the various habeas procedures to

3

act on that claim of innocence and make a determination.

4

That whole process was going forward before Judge Hinojosa

5

when the Fifth Circuit stopped the process.
QUESTION:

6

Well, now most states have provisions

7

for letting a convicted defendant come in with new

8

evidence, limited to a certain amount of time.

9

right?

10

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

I know other states do.

I

11

don't agree with the states count in this, but I think

12

quite a large number.

QUESTION:

And in this case it has been some

years, I guess.

15

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

It has been 10 years, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And the state's period for coming in

with new evidence has been exhausted long before.
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

It's a 30-day period, Your

20

Honor, in Texas.

21

take this claim originally simply said it was not a claim,

22

no jurisdiction for that claim.

23

And the Texas court to whom we tried to

QUESTION:

And Texas does have a method by which

24

someone in Herrera's position could ask for clemency or

relief through the governor, I guess?

We have not had a hearing and we have

QUESTION:

That's pending?

13

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Perhaps so, Your Honor.

Under

14

the Texas rules it's not even clear that we're entitled to

15

be before the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole.

16

way to get there it seems to me as I read their rules

17

that all members of the prosecution team, that is

18

the prosecution, the prosecutor, the sheriff, and the

19

judge have to make application and have to agree to that

20

submission, or alternatively there is to be a court

21

judgment perhaps supported by affidavits.

22

So the possibility if we went forward with this

matter before Judge Hinojosa and got a judgment of actual

24

innocence, that might give us an entry point to the Texas

clemency proceeding.

But there's not any great history of

QUESTION:

We know at least Randall

Would you be challenging, would you

7

be making this argument if Texas had a, say a 5-year time

8

limit?
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

9

Yes, sir.

Your Honor, I

10

believe that innocence is a value which trumps all other

11

time limits, and in that I go back to Judge Friendly's

12

1970 law review article in which he said that innocence

13

ought to be a paramount virtue and you have to look at
that - -

15

QUESTION:

But do you think that, do you think

16

that a judge presented with newly discovered evidence of

17

guilt or innocence of the offense, do you think he's

18

entitled before ordering a hearing to ask himself or

19

herself well, even with the newly discovered evidence is

20

there any argument that the Jackson rule, that Jackson is

21

not or is satisfied?

22

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Yes, in general, Your Honor,

23

it seems to me that's exactly the process that ought to be

24

followed, that a judge ought to look first of all to see

25

whether the pleading stage is satisfied.

QUESTION:

But let's say we disagreed with you

that there's no time limit on claims of innocence.

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

And let's say that we would say to

17

ourselves at least they have to come in before 10 years.

Now you, you wouldn't win this case just because the state

10

Justice, I do appreciate the fact that a great deal of the

we apply it across the board to all prisoners, no matter

2

how much after the fact they choose to bring in new

3

evidence raising a colorable claim of innocence.

The

4

witnesses from the prior trial are dead or gone.

The

5

burden this would put upon a system of justice is

6

enormous.

7

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, first of all we're

8

not asking for the very broad rule which you suggest in

9

your question.
QUESTION:

10

But I'm saying it's illogical not to

11

ask for the broad rule.

If the principle of

12

constitutionality you're asserting is correct, I don't see

3

why it's any more justified to keep someone in prison for

4

life than it is to, than it is to execute them.
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

5

And perhaps, Your Honor, this

6

Court will at some point reach that, but it need not reach

7

that point on this submission because we do maintain,

8

along with earlier court decisions, that death is

9

different and that all of the many claims that the state

20

makes for all the processes that might be available, they

21

are clearly not available to someone who has been

22

executed.

23

QUESTION:

Well, now Texas or any other state is

24

free to adopt the rule you're arguing for, isn't it, by

25

legislation?

I mean, they could do that.

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, when I read the

4

phrases used by this Court referring to miscarriages of

5

justice and I began to put in my mind what is the greatest

6

possible miscarriage of justice, it occurs to me that the

7

greatest one that I could formulate would be the execution

8

of an innocent person or the execution of a person who had

9

a colorable claim of innocence.

You would not want that

person to be executed without hearing that case.

Suppose

18

that Texas allowed a new trial 10 years later on the basis

19

of this evidence, but went ahead and put in all the

20

evidence it had before.

21

that would enable a jury to return a guilty verdict again,

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I --

Could the jury disbelieve these late

coming affidavits and continue to find Mr. Herrera guilty?
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, of course these

affidavits in a full evidentiary hearing would be turned

6

into extra witnesses being placed before a trial.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

9

Yes.
I think our burden is to show

that a jury, based on all the evidence, not just the

10

evidence that is judged by the Jackson standard but all

11

the evidence judged under the Kuhlmann standard, would

12

mean that a jury probably would not have reached that

QUESTION:

This is a full scale trial before the

Federal judge, or does he just examine affidavits?
MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

Your Honor, it seems to me

21

that this is a staged proceeding in much the way that all

22

habeas cases are, under great control of the Federal

23

district judge under the habeas rules.

24

initially not a trial, it is first of all a review of the

25

pleadings to find out if they're adequate.

community over the question whether all time limits for

such motions should be abolished.

13

of their abolition was that eliminating time periods was

necessary to prevent miscarriages of justice.

15

contrary argument, the argument in favor of the retention

16

of such time periods, was that it was necessary to promote

finality.

that today the balance of interests that might be

And it would also be a mistake to conclude

10

that was conducted by this Court nearly a half century ago

11

that no time period can be said to be valid.

In fact the contemporary evidence in this regard

supports the continued vitality of this Court's judgment.

those laws petitioner could not have obtained relief in

this widespread recognition that there should be some time

22

fact that the Constitution supplies no objective basis for

to channel such motions to the process of executive
clemency.
In fact Chief Justice Harlen Fisk Stone made
that precise point in 1944 when he transmitted to the
Federal rules advisory committee this Court's comments on
what ultimately became Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
33.

Chief Justice Stone rhetorically asked is it not

desirable that at some point of time further consideration
of criminal cases by the Court should be at an end after
which appeal should be made to executive clemency alone.
We submit that the answer to Chief Justice Stone's
question is yes, the same answer this Court gave nearly a
half century ago.

The procedure he described is the

procedure we have historically followed, and that
historical procedure is fully consistent with due process.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Larkin.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:54 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
