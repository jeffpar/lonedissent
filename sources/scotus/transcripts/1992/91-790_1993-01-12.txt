3

MR. TRIENENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises from a railroad crossing
accident in which respondent's husband died.
Every one of these crossing accidents is a

4

serious matter, and when the number of accidents reached

5

the thousands with the increase in highway traffic, this

6

became a matter of national concern.

7

Congress faced up to this problem in the Federal

8

Safety Act of

9

Transportation to issue regulations and standards for all

20

areas of railroad safety and it directed the Secretary to

21

undertake a coordinated effort toward solutions to the

22

grade crossing problem under his authority under both the

23

Railway Safety Act and the highway legislation.

Congress provided a sweeping preemption provision as

until such time as the Secretary has adopted a rule,

language was to avoid a lapse in responsibilities between

8

the time the statute passed and the regulations were

9

issued.

10

A State may adopt or continue in force any law,

Now, the until such time

In 1973, Congress went further.

It passed a

11

highway safety act in which the States were required to

12

survey all highway rail crossings and implement

13

improvements.

14

Now, as authorized and directed by Congress, the

15

Secretary has issued many, many regulations, and many of

16

those include safety at grade crossings.

laws covering the same subject matter are no longer in

What did that regulation require?

MR. TRIENENS:

It provided that the

6

picking a reasonable selection of a device, gate, sign,

8

responsibility was placed exclusively upon the State

authorities.
QUESTION:

Even there there was going to be a

11

lapse between the time the State could implement its

12

program and the time when the railroads might begin

13

withdrawing from this field.

14

MR. TRIENENS:

Don't you think?

Well, possibly.

I think the

15

literal reading of this and the practical reading of the

16

statute is that when the responsibility shifted, the

identify the point at which preemption occurred.

QUESTION:

I'm just pressing Justice Kennedy's

point.

I think it is an important point because although

6

it's time past and it's not involved in this case,

7

bear upon whether your interpretation of when the

8

preemption occurs is a reasonable one.

interpretation leaves a time period, namely the period

crossing.

So, the answer

That's what the statute

This is 4 years after Congress had said the States

QUESTION:

Mr. Trienens, I'm having a -- I guess

10

a different problem about identifying the scope of the

11

subject matter, and let me just give an example.

12

not the only one that I have in mind, but let me just give

13

this as an example.

This is

14

With respect to those cases in which, as I

15

understand it, Federal funds are used to improve the

16

condition of the -- the safety conditions at a grade

17

crossing, and it is determined I guess in accordance with

18

the manual that some kind of a device should be installed,

19

as I understand the reg, the reg provides that the device

20

is to include automatic gates.

21

Well, the provision that it should include

22

automatic gates leaves open -- in fact, it seems to imply

23

- - that other devices and other means of warning might be

24

appropriate and might be imposed, which I assume refers

25

back to imposed under State law.

And I further assume, since I don't see anything

1

2

to the contrary, that it does not -- that that assumption

3

does not distinguish between State law in the sense of law

4

under which the State as a government might decide what

5

the devices should be or State law, such as common law or

6

tort law, which might decide the duty incumbent on the

7

railroad which they could only satisfy by certain devices.
So with respect to that particular example,

8

9

doesn't the regulation itself imply that there is going to

10

be some State law relating to the safety at the grade

11

crossing which survives even that regulation?
MR. TRIENENS:

12

No, no.

What it does imply is

13

there is a State responsibility to select and determine

14

the appropriate device at each crossing.

15

responsibility is a responsibility imposed by Federal law.
QUESTION:

16

That

Why does it imply a responsibility as

17

opposed simply to a remaining power?

18

the -- we can't tell what the responsibility is for the

19

reg, and it seems to leave it simply open, and I suppose

20

the answer would have to be an answer under State law.
MR. TRIENENS:

21

22

No, because the reg in question

-- you're referring to I believe part 646 of the manual.

MR. TRIENENS:

1

Well, the manual and the way the

2

States wanted it, because there was a -- there was an

3

effort to have further detail and elaborate formulas on

4

whether gates or not gates -- the way the States wanted

5

it, knowing they had this responsibility, was to say there

6

was a variety of circumstances, and they wanted more

flexibility.
The regulations I'm talking about not only

9

impose the responsibility for selection of devices upon

10

the State officials, but tells them how to go about it.

11

It says based on an engineering study at the particular

12

crossing, you shall decide what's appropriate.

14

was exclusive responsibility, the regulation also says

Now, these regulations I've been reciting put

matter is the subject matter of all State rules affecting

safety at grade crossings as opposed to State rules or

8

simply rules affecting the need for devices, which is

simply a subset of the former?

QUESTION:

The Secretary has issued

Mr. Trienens, why don't -- why isn't

5

a better explanation of what you're arguing for that this

6

is conflict preemption?

7

Justice Souter does, squeezing this within the terms

8

regulation, order, or standard relating to railroad

9

safety.

I have the same trouble that

I mean, there's no standard contained in that

10

regulation.

It just allocates the responsibility for

11

issuing the standard.
Now, I can -- if you're making the argument that

12

3

it is inconsistent with placing that responsibility upon

4

the State itself to instead, by State common law, impose

5

that responsibility upon the railroad, then I can

6

understand.

7

That's a conflict preemption argument.

MR. TRIENENS:

Well, our argument in our brief

8

makes both the conflict point and the point that the 434

9

covers the subject matter.

It certainly -- nobody on the

20

other side has ever argued this wasn't a matter relating

21

to railroad safety, whether you have a gate or a sign or a

22

light.

about that.

Does the plaintiff's theory include a

5

failure -- a theory that somehow the railroad failed to

6

identify the existence of a hazardous crossing?

7

MR. TRIENENS:

Well, I -- their theory

8

apparently, as stated in their brief, is that the railroad

9

had the responsibility -- and presumably implicitly we

10

failed to perform this duty -- of determining that

11

improved grade crossing devices are needed and to

12

implement them.

it.

I think that's their case.

Or to at least identify and call to

the attention of the State authorities the hazards?

17

MR. TRIENENS:

Well, they make that point, but

it's -- first place, if it's their responsibility -- and

QUESTION:

MR. TRIENENS:

To whom?

The railroad?

To the railroad?
I don't know because all I'm

4

concerned about here is the fact that having this process,

5

having the Federal regulations prescribing the process,

6

and having a statute that says that when you cover this

7

very subject matter, it's preempted, we don't get to that.

8

They say, well, you know, maybe you would have a

nice State law defense, and maybe a jury would find for

you.

But on this narrow issue, this is not for a State

11

court or a State jury.

QUESTION:

Mr. Trienens, are you going to talk

at all about the speed issue?

MR. TRIENENS:

15

I have one question or two

Well, the -- on the speed issue,

What happens if the train went

7

MR. TRIENENS:

Would that be a matter

Could they --

It would be a violation of

Federal law, but you could sue in the State court on a

9

common law basis under a case Justice Brennan wrote called

10

Crane.

In other words, there would be a violation of this

11

regulation and the railroad would be subject to a suit.
QUESTION:

You could be covered.

incompatible with essentially a local hazard?

does that play out in your view?

7

MR. TRIENENS:

What - - how

Well, the local hazard -- I think

8

the court of appeals below and the Solicitor General, we

9

all agree.

The local -- essentially the local hazard is

20

not implicated in this case because if you had said every

21

grade crossing is a local crossing, that would just

22

swallow the national rule that they got out.

QUESTION:

No, not a gate problem, just that

because of the particular local conditions, the

statute as saying the speed limit is not always going to

be -- there could be an essentially local safety hazard

which would indicate that a lower rate of speed would be
necessary to avoid the danger at that local place.
MR. TRIENENS:

Well, if a State -- not the city,

something very unusual about the Horseshoe Curve - - and I

which again, by its terms, seems to imply to me that there

may be some source of authority that could appropriately

set a speed as appropriate, but less than that which is

17

allowable, which again implies that there is some State

18

authority left to do this.

19

The regulation on speed -- it was at 213.9 --

MR. TRIENENS:

Well, we don't agree that there's

20

any such implication, and one of the reasons is that the

21

Secretary of Transportation has a number of motives, one

22

of which is to get the trains through.

is -- the allowable speed is the speed you're allowed to

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

3

5

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is the first time in 20 years that this

6

Court has had an opportunity to interpret the preemptive

7

scope of the FRSA, and we'd like to make three basic

8

points about how we think that it needs to be interpreted.

9

And the first is that we share the view of the

10

parties that 434 should not be interpreted to preempt

11

common law tort actions against railroads for violations

12

of their duties to operate trains in a safe manner.

13

Second, we think that it is also important,

14

however, to recognize that under the language when the

15

Secretary has covered the subject matter of a railroad's

16

duty, that standard of care must govern.

17

standard of care defining the railroad's -- the content of

18

the railroad's safety obligations under the circumstances

19

that must control in this case and in other cases.

20

It is a Federal

So, the critical question becomes whether, in

21

fact, the Secretary has covered the subject matter of the

22

particular claims that are at issue.

23

As to those claims, on the grade crossing issue,

24

we do not think that the regulations cover the subject

25

matter of these claims.

On the speed issue, we think that

when we're dealing with grade crossings, although the

intersections, whereas before under State law, it was the

with the old common law rule.

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, we don't see what you

In fact -Don't they

MS. MAHONEY:

That's different than the MUTCD.

21

Now we're talking about the Federal funding program, and

22

yes, to use Federal funds, they have a responsibility to

of the statute does not speak in any way to what the

2

State's obligations are with respect to grade crossings

3

that are not improved with Federal funds.

And, in fact, the regulation, 646.210,

specifically says that State laws that govern the

railroad's share of grade crossing improvements shall not

The railroad has gained numerous benefits

Honor, at the very bottom it begins.

2

QUESTION:

Thank you.

3

MS. COLSTON:

Congress declares that the laws,

4

rules, regulations, orders, and standards relating to

5

railroad safety should be nationally uniform.to the extent

6

practicable, thus beginning the section with a recognition

7

that all laws relating to railroad safety can't be

8

completely uniform.

9

Then the second section.

A State may adopt or

10

continue in force any law, rule, regulation, order, or

11

standard relating to - - relating to - - railroad safety.

12

That's preservative of the State's powers.

3
4
5

Then the preempting provision.

Until the

Secretary covers the subject matter.
This statute is drawn very narrowly.

Therefore,

6

it must be construed very narrowly and especially in light

7

of the presumption against preemption when you've got such

8

traditional State police powers.

9

QUESTION:

20

very narrowly, Mrs. Colston?

21

Why do you say the statute is drawn

MS. COLSTON:

Your Honor, without 434 -- the

22

preemption might have even been broader without it, but it

23

preserves State laws relating to railroad safety until the

24

Secretary covered the subject matter, and that --

as either a narrow or a broad statute.

2

fairly common preemption provision.
MS. COLSTON:

3

It strikes me as a

Yes, Your Honor, it is fairly

4

common, but the language used -- the language Congress

5

chose --we have to assume they knew the meaning of what

6

they were saying.

7

QUESTION:

Well, that's exactly the language I'm

8

referring to, and I'm telling you I don't see how you can

9

classify that as a narrow preemption provision.
MS. COLSTON:

10

Your Honor, I classify it as such

11

because it says that State law is preserved relating to

12

railroad safety, and then when it says what's preempted,

13

what does it say?

14

matter, not -- the Secretary.didn't say, well, when the

15

Secretary passes a regulation that relates to railroad

16

safety.

17

That's why I say the statute is narrowly drawn.

The Secretary has to cover the subject

The Congress said cover the subject matter.

It's also supported by the legislative history,

Your Honor.

The legislative history in a railroad

21

under the FRSA -- this is what Congress said.

22

may adopt or continue in force any law, rule, regulation,

23

et cetera, until the Secretary has promulgated a specific

24

rule.

25

authorizing Federal statute from preempting the field.

The States

This prevents the mere enactment of a broad

Then to ensure even more that State law wouldn't

1
2

be arbitrarily displaced, they included the local safety

3

hazard exception, which says States may adopt rules,

4

regulations that the Secretary has already covered when

5

there's ai local safety hazard and it's not incompatible

6

with the Federal rule and it's not an undue burden on

7

interstate commerce.
Reading this and then reading it as this Court

always does in light of its stated purpose, the purpose of

the FRSA, not as CSX would have you believe, is not

11

uniformity-

railroad related accidents and to reduce damage caused by

Are Federal funds used to conduct the

MS. COLSTON:

Yes, sir, they are.

for the surveying process, some to pay the diagnostic
team.

And so there you go.

The diagnostic team walks

Boom, you're preempted under that

analysis.
The Secretary in the reports to Congress noted
that because the railroad does have tort liability in
cases such as -- in railroad crossing accidents, this
continues, a just -- a continuing interest -- excuse me.
This justifies a continuing interest on the part of the
railroad in the total safety effort.
If they were to be preempted, Your Honors, from
placing gate arms at a hazardous crossing, it would remove
all incentive to improve safety, and that would be in
direct opposition to the purpose of the Federal Railroad
Safety Act.
