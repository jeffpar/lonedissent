CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Everett.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBINSON 0. EVERETT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8

10

MR. EVERETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As our complaint seeks to make clear, this case

11

poses the basic issue of how far a legislature may go in

12

seeking to guarantee the election to Congress of persons

13

of a particular race.

14

in the form of the map, which is a reproduction in color

15

of a map which was earlier lodged with the Court at page

16

133A of the jurisdictional statement in Pope v. Blue, and

17

there are a number of copies of that which I believe are

18

before the Court.

19

Perhaps the best evidence is here

We proceed in a sense on the theory that while

20

we are reluctant to use political pornography -- and this

21

has been described as political pornography, but really

22

the only way to understand what took place in North

23

Carolina is to look at the evidence thereof.

24
25

And our complaint seeks briefly to set forth the
history of the developments in our State.

Basically the

1

Attorney General in the summer of 1991 and in the fall

2

made clear that it was necessary to have two majority-

3

minority districts.

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Are you talking about the United

States Attorney General?
MR. EVERETT:

Yessiree.

Yes, Your Honor.

7

Indeed, it was Attorney General William Barr at that

8

particular time.

9
10

QUESTION:

Did he -- the federal statute?

MR. EVERETT:

He was relying on the Voting

11

Rights Act.

12

Voting Rights Act which, as we understand some of the

13

recent opinions of the Court, was erroneous.

14

that's the way we interpret the Growe case and the

15

Voinovich case.

16

This was apparently an interpretation of the

At least

But in any event, he set forth preconditions.

17

Basically, as we allege in the complaint, the precondition

18

for clearing -- for preclearing the North Carolina plan

19

was that there be two seats which would be guaranteed for

20

election of African Americans to the Congress of the

21

United States so that here, in a sense, we oppose the

22

issue of legal segregation of the congressional delegation

23

of North Carolina.

24
25

Now, North Carolina is a State where the
minority population is relatively dispersed.

Indeed, we

1

have also lodged with the Court various data pertaining to

2

the dispersion of the population throughout the 100

3

counties of the State.

4

concentrated in the east and in the Piedmont, that is to

5

say, along the coast and in the center of the State.

Most of the black population is

Interestingly, there are only five counties in

6

7

the State and those, with one exception -- and that's not

8

a major exception -- are relatively small counties, only

9

five counties in which there is a majority of black

10

persons.

11

submitted to the Attorney General - -

12

13

And as a result, after the first plan was

QUESTION:

There are only five counties in which

there's a majority of white persons?

14

MR. EVERETT:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. EVERETT:

Of black persons.

Of black persons?
Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

And

17

interestingly, those are counties of relatively small

18

population in the northeastern part of the State.

19

one county which I would say is mid-sized.

There's

20

So, as a result of that, the only way basically

21

to achieve this objective of having two majority-minority

22

districts -- and indeed, these are super majority-minority

23

districts because it's not 51 percent.

24

margin for error, not 65 percent as in the U.J.O. case,

25

but moving up into the mid-50's.

There's some

The only way to achieve that was to violate

1

2

every one of the principles of redistricting and

3

reapportionment which have heretofore been accepted by the

4

Court, or at least as we understand it, which have been

5

accepted by the Court.

6

where there was a reference to a pattern of crazy quilts

7

which in and of itself would be sufficient to invalidate

8

the constitutionality of the reapportionment.

We harken back to Reynolds v. Sims

We harken back to U.J.O. itself where in one of

9
10

the opinions -- I believe it was the opinion of Justice

11

White -- there is a reference -QUESTION:

12

Mr. Everett,

could I interrupt you?

13

You say that the district violates all the principles that

14

have been established in the cases.

15

violate the one person/one vote principle, does it?
MR. EVERETT:

17

QUESTION:

24
25

How about the one person/one vote

MR. EVERETT:

It does not violate the one

That's correct.

23

It violates every principle except

21

it doesn't

the principle of giving a majority -- to preselecting --

18
19

Well,

Tell me what principle does it

violate.
MR. EVERETT:

Well,

it violates the principles

of compactness.

QUESTION:

1

2

But are they constitutional

principles?
MR. EVERETT:

3

We would submit that compactness

4

and seeking a community of interest is a constitutional

5

principle and that at least -- put it this way, Your Honor

6

-- that it is not permissible to disregard everything else

7

for the sole purpose of targeting that the seat will have

8

a person of a particular race.
QUESTION:

9

Is -- when you say everything else,

10

do you include anything other than compactness in the

11

concept of everything else?

Well, but this district is entirely

contiguous, isn't it?
MR. EVERETT:

Well, they're contiguous in a very

marginal sense of the word.
QUESTION:

I think --

But it is entirely contiguous, is --

19
20

I

MR. EVERETT:

Contiguous -- I think actually,

21

Your Honor, one of the districts is cut in the middle by

22

District 12, but we would view contiguousness as meaning

23

more than a contact at a point so that we would suggest

24

that if there's any significance to contiguousness other

25

than, say, a point -- one point where there is an

1

infinitesimal contact, that it violates contiguousness.
Certainly compactness it violates no matter what

2

3

the test is.

4

Community of interest it violates.

Take the

5

12th district, which is the one that has received quite a

6

bit of attention and which stretches from Durham, my

7

hometown, to Gastonia.

8

It's described by Judge Vorhees in his dissent in the

9

lower court.

It snakes along Interstate 1-85.

It snakes along.

At some points it is no

10

wider than 1-85.

11

than two lanes of 1-85.

13

another.

14

In fact, at some points it's no wider

QUESTION:

You can go from one side of the

Well, Mr. Everett, I guess this Court

15

summarily affirmed in a previous case that came before us

16

raising just these points.

17

MR. EVERETT:

Well, Your Honor, we think that we

18

came at it from an entirely different viewpoint.

That was

19

a case in which the assertion was predicated on political

20

gerrymandering.

21

for the sole purpose of targeting two seats for persons of

22

a particular race.

23

think that perhaps the issue of compactness could have

24

been raised differently in that case and there might have

25

been some constitutional issues before you.

There was no assertion that this was done

That we think is the fatal flaw.

We

But what we are saying is that even in search of

1

2

diversity in the Congress, the legislature of North

3

Carolina and the Attorney General can go only so far, but

4

they cannot go as far as they went in this particular

5

instance.
QUESTION:

6

Well, that brings us back to the

7

point Justice Stevens was beginning to discuss with you.

8

Isn't a State free to reject the idea of compactness if it

9

chooses?

10

MR. EVERETT:

We would think there are some

11

limitations even on how far the State can go in rejecting

12

the principle of compactness.

13

in answer to your question, that perhaps they can reject

14

compactness, but not do so in the context of seeking to

15

assure the election of a person of a particular race,

16

whatever that race may be.

17

QUESTION:

We certainly would say this

Well, isn't that your basic point,

18

Mr. Everett, that that sort of intent or motivation on the

19

part of the legislature is subject to strict scrutiny?

20

MR. EVERETT:

21

QUESTION:

Exactly, exactly.

So that your argument really isn't -

22

-does not rest, I take it, at any point on the fact that

23

any of these other principles have been mandated either by

24

the authority of this Court or by any other authority that

25

we would have to recognize.

Your case really rests simply

1

on the motivation by which this particular configuration

2

supposedly was justified.
MR. EVERETT:

3

That's the key to it, Justice

4

Souter, that it rests on the motivation.

5

distortions are a reflection of the motivation, and the

6

distortions show what happens once we start down the path

7

to what might be termed segregating the electoral process

because - QUESTION:

In a sense the

But none of them has independent

constitutional significance.
MR. EVERETT:

11

We would think that is -- that the

12

motivation is the independent constitutional grounds for

13

invalidating it.

14

goes beyond strict scrutiny, that anytime a motivation of

15

this particular type is that which dominates the

16

legislative purpose, anytime the legislature is thinking

17

of choosing -- of drawing boundaries for the specific

18

purpose of assuring that persons of a particular race will

19

be elected, then under those circumstances, it's invalid.

We would contend that regardless -- it

unconstitutional.

MR. EVERETT:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. EVERETT:

If it required --

How about authorizes it?
We would say that if it authorized

4

the legislature to act with that intent and if, in fact,

5

the legislature acted with that intent, that then it would

6

be unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

7
8

Well, how much of North Carolina is

the kind of State that the Voting Rights Act applies to?
MR. EVERETT:

40 counties.

10

counties which require preclearance.

11

counties would not.

QUESTION:

There are 40
The remaining

However -So, you don't deny that you had to

have preclearance for this redistricting.
MR. EVERETT:

14

Preclearance was required, but as

15

we understand it, preclearance does not change the basic

16

rules.

17

those in Gingles are totally ignored.

Preclearance does not mean that factors such as

18

No, no.

QUESTION:

2

MR. EVERETT:

3

Yes.
-- in requiring that there be the

majority-minority districts.

4

As we understood the opinion in Voinovich, there

5

is nothing in the Voting Rights Act which requires that

6

there be particular types of majority-minority districts.

7

This is something that in a sense is the primary

8

responsibility of the State so long as the State does not

9

violate other principles in a manner that dilutes the

10

vote.

Now, there has been no dilution of the vote in this

11

particular instance.
Indeed, it's interesting to look at statistics

presented in the brief by the appellees.

But if the Attorney General -- don't

QUESTION:

How does that work?

7

MR. EVERETT:

Well, to focus on the issue that

8

the Court presented, the legislature, after the refusal of

9

preclearance, then went ahead and with reckless abandon

10

drew something that apparently was not in line with the

11

suggestions of the Attorney General so that -QUESTION:

Well, the Attorney General suggested

that the State needed to have another majority-minority

They did.

one might be created in, what, the southeast corner?

MR. EVERETT:

19

QUESTION:

In the southeast, yes.

The southeast corner of the State?

20

Then he didn't -- but anyway, he did -- before you could

get preclearance, he thought you had to have another

Mr. Everett, what's the effect of the

Voting Rights Act by its terms where 40 out of 100

7

counties are covered?

8

9

MR. EVERETT:

Well, we would contend that there

is a requirement of preclearance admittedly, but that a

10

plan which burdens the areas that are not subject to

11

preclearance and unduly burdens them is unconstitutional.

12

QUESTION:

Supposing you were to draw a district

13

that was entirely in areas that were not subject to

14

preclearance.

15

to do with that?

16

Would the Voting Rights Act have anything

MR. EVERETT:

We would say it would not, that it

17

should be separated - - that there would be no nexus

18

between any violation and the purported corrective action.

19

QUESTION:

But are all of the counties which are

20

the subject of this district which you're complaining

21

about -- are they all subject to preclearance?

25

MR. EVERETT:

Relatively few of them are, as a

matter of fact.
QUESTION:

So, many of the counties in this

district are not subject to preclearance?

1

MR. EVERETT:

A number of them that are in the

2

12th district, which is the one we are particularly-

3

focusing on, are not subject to preclearance.

4

example, Durham County is not subject, and indeed, Durham

5

County is one which in the Thornburg case, in Thornburg v.

Gingles, was accepted because the political process was

not operating in a way that in any - - that diluted the

MR. EVERETT:

QUESTION:

It was a three-judge court.

Was this issue brought before it

16

about whether or not that 12th district was subject to

preclearance at all?

18

MR. EVERETT:

Well, we brought up that -- and

19

we've consistently taken the position that to manipulate

20

the preclearance requirement for the 40 counties,

21

primarily in the northeast, as a basis for covering the

Voting Rights Act, but in addition and more fundamental we

2

take the position that what was done is not authorized by

3

the U.S. Constitution.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Everett, do I understand

5

your argument here to be that the problem is not race

6

consciousness as such in drawing lines, it's the

7

specificity of the race consciousness in saying, in

8

effect, that there must be a quota of two districts?

9
10

MR. EVERETT:
QUESTION:

That is basically it.

Well, how then do -- how do you draw

11

the line on your theory between what is a permissible use

12

of race consciousness in this kind of districting or

13

redistricting and what is impermissible?

14

what is the principle on which that line is drawn?

15

MR. EVERETT:

How is the - -

The principle to some extent can

16

be related to factors such as those in the Gingles case.

17

Where there is a compactness of a minority group and it's

18

broken aside -- broken apart, then we would submit that

19

the Voting Rights Act could authorize race conscious

20

corrective action, but what we're concerned --

21

QUESTION:

Well, what about a case like this in

22

which you're not so much breaking apart a district in

23

which a violation has occurred, you've simply got to come

24

up with another district and, as a consequence,

25

essentially a whole new configuration?

QUESTION:

It's --

What if the Attorney General had

13

suggested in this case not that there should be a second

14

district, minority-majority district, but that it would be

15

permissible to have two, and he would like to know why two

16

had not been proposed?

17

that some race consciousness is permissible, would that

18

have been impermissible?

19

MR. EVERETT:

20

QUESTION:

Given the fact that you accept

We think even that goes too far.

I guess the trouble I'm having is you

21

accept the principle that there can be some race

22

consciousness, but I don't understand how you are willing

to let that principle be applied in a concrete way at

But there again we're getting back

argument that race -- when race is taken into account,

15

although that may be permissible per se, it cannot be

taken into account, in effect, without serving a series of

17

other principles like compactness, community

18

identification, and so on.

QUESTION:

Mr. Everett, I thought part of your

2

answer to Justice Souter's question was that race could be

3

taken into consideration if race had previously been taken

4

into consideration in an adverse way --

5

MR. EVERETT:

6

QUESTION:

That's --

-- that you could right that wrong.

7

But I wonder if you're wise in conceding that race should

8

be taken into -- could be taken into consideration in any

9

further extent.

10

MR. EVERETT:

Well, I perhaps misspoke myself

11

earlier because I was thinking of the corrective situation

12

where something has been done on racial grounds adverse to

13

a minority group as, for example, breaking apart a

14

community of minority persons into two districts and

15

thereby basically diluting the vote.

16

certainly some corrective action could be taken, and the

17

corrective action would take race into account.

18

QUESTION:

Then I think

Well, Mr. Everett, I mean, you say

19

community of - - communities of interest can be taken into

20

account, but doesn't that necessarily mean that racial

21

groups can be taken into account as well?

22

fact there's a community that's a religious community, a

23

racial community or whatever, why can't that be taken into

24

account by intelligent legislators in districting?

25

thought you were making that concession before.

you are white, you will vote for a white, and if you're

MR. EVERETT:

That's using race not for

Justice Souter, that's exactly it.

The assumption here -- the stereotype underlying this is

that a black in Durham has more in common with a black in

Mr. Everett, just one last point to

make sure I understand your principle.

on the principle of the color-blind Constitution, are you?

accept that.

QUESTION:

Do you want us to -- do we overrule

-- do we say that the possibility applying a Gingles

analysis cannot be anticipated in redistricting?

17

MR. EVERETT:

Well, the Gingles analysis, if it

18

were applied in this particular instance, would not permit

19

the sort of result that was achieved here.

20

QUESTION:

But you -- but is it fair to say that

21

you accept the principle that redistricting can be done on

22

the basis of trying to anticipate the possibility of a

Gingles violation and to avoid it by drawing lines in such

a way as to avoid voter dilution?

there can be an effort to avoid any future dilution so

That's --

But in any case, that's not a

principle of a color-blind constitution, is it?

Well, that may not be in one

sense, but certainly, as we view it, some of the basic

9

concept of ignoring racial stereotypes -- that we view as

10

an essential to the color-blind Constitution, and that we

think is the principle that has been violated here.

MR. POWELL:

As the Attorney General administers

to avoid vote dilution of minority voters.

2

Right, but if it doesn't succeed,

3

then the harm that appellants are most concerned about is

4

really not present.
But the Voting Rights Act specifically addresses

5

6

the problem not of individual discrimination against --

7

not only of individual discrimination against individual

8

blacks, but the fear that a State either intentionally or

9

through setting up districts that in concert with private

10

behavior will have the effect of diluting the black vote.

11

And where you have racially polarized voting and a

12

minority is submerged in a majority white district, that

13

will be the effect.
And Congress determined that full effectuation

14
15

of the voting rights protected by the Fifteenth Amendment

16

required that that be addressed as well, and this Court in

17

Gingles and in Beer and other cases has sustained -- has

18

applied the Voting Rights Act on that premise.

19

not believe that the principle of the color-blind

20

Constitution requires a State to be blind to the fact that

21

its citizens regrettably may vote along racial lines and

22

to take account of the fact that its own redistricting

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I think there would have to

11

be -- for a State to do it without the Voting Rights Act,

12

there would have to be a basis in racial block voting for

13

that because the State would have to be addressing - - and

14

this was the premise of a portion of the opinion in U.J.O.

15

There would have to be a premise of some discriminatory

conduct going on that the State would address.

that extent, it would be something of the same motivation

that Congress had for enacting the Voting Rights Act.

I wanted to address one point here.

So, to

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think it would be permissible

private discriminatory conduct.

The Attorney General in this case did not

require two districts.

3

that the State had failed to carry its burden of proving

4

the absence of discriminatory purpose because the State's

5

proffered reasons for rejecting a second majority-minority

6

district appeared to be pretextual.

7

What the Attorney General said is

This Court has upheld in Katzenbach v. South

8

Carolina, the shifting of the burden of proof to the State

9

to demonstrate that its plans are free of racially

10

discriminatory purpose or effect.
QUESTION:

12

As I understand your argument,

though, Mr. Kneedler, you're not relying on the fact that

the Attorney General turned this plan down.

making the same argument if the State had done this on its

5

own before submitting it to the Attorney General.

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's correct.

You'd be

States should be

7

encouraged -- far from being a suspect, States should be

8

encouraged to conduct their districting in a way that

9

comes into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, section

20

2 and section 5, although in this case, the Attorney

21

General's objection letter furnished the State with a

22

pretty firm basis for doubt as to whether it could carry

23

its burden if it chose, for example, the alternative to go

discriminatory purpose.

2

So, clearly the basis for the Attorney General's

3

objection or the State's concern in this case, a fear that

4

the burden could not be carried, was an authorized

5

interpretation by the Attorney General.

6

General is required to object where the State cannot carry

its burden in that respect.

So, it is permissible for a State to take into

account that it can't carry the shifted burden that this

Court sustained in Katzenbach v. South Carolina, and

therefore to devise another plan that will meet the

12

Attorney General's concerns or the concern in section 5 of

3

the Voting Rights Act as such that plans be free of racial

discrimination.

5

We think it is the existence of the Voting

6

Rights Act in this case and Congress' thorough examination

7

of the need for the Voting Rights Act periodically that

8

distinguishes this setting from the cases in which the

9

Court has required strict scrutiny.

This Court has

20

recognized that the Voting Rights Act was a drastic remedy

21

in the section 5 preclearance setting, for example, to

22

address the pernicious evil of voting discrimination, and

rather than require case-by-case adjudication, Congress

determined, and this Court held validly determined, that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBINSON 0. EVERETT

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

7

MR. EVERETT:

Let me respond first to the last

8

remark by Mr. Kneedler, Mr. Chief Justice.

The position

9

seems to be that if the Voting Rights Act authorizes

10

something, then it is automatically valid.

11

be the case in some situations, but we would submit not in

12

the situation that is involved here.

13

And that might

Moreover, it's our contention that the Voting

14

Rights Act did not cause this conduct, that it was done by

15

misinterpretation, and it was done by a misinterpretation

16

on all sides, that the Voting Rights Act leaves the

17

parties free to choose districts other than majority-

18

minority districts, but there's no compulsion, no

19

authorization to have a majority-minority district.

20

And our complaint very basically sets forth in

21

its -- in the jurisdictional statement that we're

22

complaining of a quota system of a proportional

23

representation which was, in fact, being forced upon the

24

congressional delegation.

MR. EVERETT:

Section 2 has a specific proviso.

So, we maintain that it's not authorized by the Congress,

10

that it is not authorized by the Constitution, that the

11

result is to produce the type of distortion that was

12

reflected in the map, and to produce a process that is

inimicable to all the ideals of the Fourteenth and
