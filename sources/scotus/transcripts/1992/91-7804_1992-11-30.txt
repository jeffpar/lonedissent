MR. FILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This is a statute of limitations case.

QUESTION:

What is the

Okay.
Now, what if it's more than 3 years

ago that the subchapter C corporation did that?
MR. FILLER:

I think the Government would not

21

dispute, frankly, Your Honor, that if this were a C

22

corporation and an adjustment of the C corporation were

23

necessary in order to adjust a shareholder's return -- and

5

QUESTION:

Well, you cited --

6

QUESTION:

Why is that?

7

MR. FILLER:

Why is that?

Because section

8

6012(a)(2) of the code provides that a C corporation, or a

9

corporation subject to taxation -- and by the way,

10

provided that much prior to 1958, when the S corporation

11

was created and carved out - -

QUESTION:

Okay, now, but you're trying to

13

answer my question, I take it.

MR. FILLER:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. FILLER:

Yes, I am.
Why don't you continue -And section 6501(a) of the code

17

provides that a 3-year period of limitations from that

18

return -- from the filing of that return is applicable to

19

the C corporation's return.
QUESTION:

20

Well, but why should the running of

21

the statute of limitations on the C corporation's return

22

prevent an adjustment in the taxpayer's return when the

23

taxpayer -- when an extension was obtained with respect to

24

him?

14

QUESTION:

You've made that statement, but I

15

simply don't -- I must say I don't follow your reasoning.

16

I don't understand from what you've said what statutory

17

provision or what case it is that you rely on to say that

18

the Government is bound in adjusting an individual

19

taxpayer's return, which it has extended the time for, by

20

the figures in a C return, which it has not extended the

time for.

MR. FILLER:

2

Section 6012(a)(2)

of the code

requires a corporation subject to taxation to file a

return.

QUESTION:

6

MR. FILLER:

I know that.
Okay.

And section 6501(a)

says,

7

okay,

that the period of limitations with respect to that

8

return is 3 years from the date of filing that return,

9

that adjustments to assess a tax within that period,

10

whether the tax is on the C corporation or the C

11

corporation's shareholders, must be made within the 3-year

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but you cite absolutely no

2

authority, no text, no statute, no regulations, no case.

3

It's just an assertion.

4

Now, the Government doesn't frontally deny what

5

you say.

6

to me that's the whole issue in the case.

7

It may do so at oral argument, but it just seems

Suppose that a corporation makes a distribution.

8

It treats it as not out of earnings and profits.

The

9

corporation's tax year closes, and it's then found that

10

there was -- it is very clear that this was a distribution

11

made out of earnings and profits.

12

why the shareholder can't be charged with a dividend.
MR. FILLER:

13

It is not clear to me

I think I know the answer, Your

14

Honor.

15

the Government would have had to attempted at least to

16

assess such a tax against the shareholder after the C

17

corporation's return was filed.

What the Government wishes

Yes.
They are assessing this under an

extension of the 3-year period on the individual.
MR. FILLER:

Yes, Your Honor, but they are two

8

separate and distinct entities, and I don't think you can

9

fail to recognize that.

10
11

They are two separate and

distinct taxable entities in the case of a C corporation.
QUESTION:

I know, but you are simply stating,

12

so far as I know, without pointing to any statutory

13

authority that the Government cannot reexamine anything

14

that comes out of a C return on an individual's return if

15

the time for examining the C return hasn't been extended.

Now, I simply don't see in your reference to

some implication from it, but it certainly isn't express.

MR. FILLER:

that in thorough research, that there is nothing from

anyone or any source or any material written to believe

3

The S corporation that we are confronted with

today is an entity created only in 1958 where, in effect,

5

you might say part of the heart of the C corporation was

pulled out and part of the provisions of the -- for the S

in some ways for a C corporation.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Filler, you may

MR. FILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Prior to the lunch break, we were discussing the

8

critical language of section 6501(a) which provides that

9

the period of limitation for assessment is 3 years from

10

the date the return -- the return -- was filed.

11

issue then before the Court is identifying what Congress

12

meant by the term, the return, in section 6501(a).

13

The real

Petitioner's position is that the return can

14

only be identified in the case of an S corporation with

15

reference to the second sentence of section 6037 of the

16

code which provides that any return filed pursuant to this

17

section, which must mean every return filed pursuant to

18

this section, shall, for purposes of chapter 66 relating

19

to limitations, be treated as a return filed by the

20

corporation under section 6012.

21

There is nothing in the language of section

22

6501(a) that refers to the shareholder's income tax return

23

as the relevant return for purposes of beginning the

24

running of the period of limitations.

2

Court reach the conclusion of the Second Circuit and

3

affirm the opinion of the Second Circuit that it's the

shareholder's return that's referred to in section

They would have to add the phrase so that

section 6501(a) read as follows:

the amount of any tax

That language is not present in section 6501(a).
QUESTION:

It seems to me it's quite natural to

read it in by implication, though.
MR. FILLER:

I think, Your Honor, that that

14

ignores the fact that there are two separate and distinct

15

taxable entities.

16

(a)(1) of the code, the shareholder is a separate taxable

17

entity and must file a return that has the period of

18

limitations under 6501(a).

19

separate return for a separate taxable entity, the

20

corporation, the C corporation, which must also file a

21

return, or by reference to the second sentence of section

22

6012, the S corporation return is treated as a corporate

23

return under section 6012 for purposes of the period of

limitation.

1

Why is the taxpayer's return treated as a return filed,

2

quote, pursuant to this section under 6037?
MR. FILLER:

3

I'm sorry now.

No.

It's the

4

corporate return, the S corporation return, that's treated

5

as a return.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FILLER:

8

QUESTION:

9
10
11

That's what I thought.
That's what I said.
So, it's only the S corporation's

return that is referred to in the second sentence, isn't
it?
MR. FILLER:

That's correct.

It is the S

12

corporation's return that is treated as a corporate return

13

filed pursuant to section 6012 that is the return in the

14

language of 6501(a) that begins the running of the period

15

of limitations from the date that return, that S

16

corporation return, was filed.

17

Yes, Justice.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Filler, you say that you don't

19

want to add in that phrase in 6501(a), but it seems to me

20

it's necessary to read in some phrase, because it says

21

within 3 years after the return was filed.

22

What -- I mean, the question comes immediately to mind,

23

what return?

24

after all relevant returns were filed, but after the

25

return was filed.

The return.

It doesn't -- it does not say within 3 years

Right?

MR. FILLER:

Nor does it say, as the Second

2

Circuit held, Your Honor, that the relevant return is the

3

return against whom the tax is imposed.

4

language in the way the Court has implied and the Second

5

Circuit held would require the Commissioner to make an

6

annual examination of all the financial transactions on a

7

return that's filed, and if the Commissioner could adjust

8

the returns such that a tax could be imposed against that

9

return, then the Second Circuit and respondent argue that

But reading the

that return has a period of limitations.

11

tax that could be imposed against the S corporation

12

return, the Second Circuit held and the respondent would

13

argue that there is no period of limitations.

14

If there is no

There's nothing in the language of section 6037,

15

6012, or 6501(a) that indicates that Congress intended,

16

okay, that this one return have two separate and distinct

you, Mr. Filler?
I don't really follow your argument.

There's

24

nothing that says about two different periods of

limitations, but it's one or the other each time.

Under section 650 , the Service has 3 years from

the filing of any return to make an assessment of the

taxes imposed on that return.

of this statute, you need to know what an assessment is.

An assessment is merely an administrative record filed in

To understand the meaning

Nothing in section 650

suggests that by

11

limiting the time for recording an assessment, the statute

12

in any manner limits the amount of taxes imposed on the

taxable income of the taxpayer by the other provisions of

the code.

I'd like to give you an example.

The rule that we are describing is

identical for subchapter C, subchapter S partnerships.

The

The income

not on the corporation.
The Second Circuit summarized this issue in the

3

Siben case when they said the return that starts the

4

running of the limitations period is that of the taxpayer

5

whose liability is being assessed and not that of a third

6

person who also reports the transaction.

7

The subchapter S return is obviously not the

8

return upon which tax can be assessed upon the individual

9

shareholder.

The corporate return doesn't contain any of

10

the individualized information or any of the information

11

about other sources of income that are required to assess

12

a tax against the individual.

13

In the Automobile Club case in this Court, the

14

Court held that an information return that lacks the data

15

necessary for the calculation and assessment of

16

deficiencies is not a tax return within the contemplation

17

of section 6501.

18

is not functionally different from a W-2 return filed by

They, therefore, cannot constitute the return that

2

commences the period for assessment of taxes against the

3

individual.

4

Turning to section 6037, which deals

5

specifically with S corporations, under that statute the

6

return of the S corporation serves two separate functions.

7

It serves as an information return providing data relevant

8

to the calculation of the shareholder's taxes.

9

section 6037 is contained within chapter 6 , part 3 of the

Indeed,

10

Internal Revenue Code, which is entitled, Information

11

Returns.
The return of the subchapter S corporation also

12

3

serves as the tax return of the S corporation in the

4

narrow circumstances when that corporation is subject to

5

tax.

6

As Congress explained in enacting section 6037 in

958, when the S corporation is itself subject to tax, the

return of the S corporation commences the period of

8

limitations for assessment of tax against the

shareholders.

MR. JONES:

Yes.

there is a basis for ascribing knowledge to the

In a limited category of cases for years after

1982, Congress changed that result.

and logical one.

I should point out that petitioner's contrary

interpretation of section 6037 would mean that Congress

3

enacted a nullity when it enacted TEFRA and applied it to

4

the unified statute of limitations provisions for large S

corporations after 1982 because, under petitioner's view,

6

the same unified statute of limitations would be reached

7

for all large and small S corporations both before and

1982 if section 6037 had the meaning for which they

contend.
Petitioner didn't have time to mention it, but

the case that's on his side in this area is the Kelley

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STUART JAY FILLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. FILLER:

Thank you, Mr. Jones.

I can only go back to the

10

beginning, and that is that the second sentence of section

11

6037 provides any return filed by an S corporation shall

12

be treated as a return of a corporation pursuant to

13

section 6012.

14

The Second Circuit makes a major -- and the

15

respondent -- major chronological error by attempting to

16

interpret section 6037 in 1958 as a provision that only

17

applies to a corporation when it is subject to tax.

18

1958, the subchapter S corporation was not subject to tax.

19

It was not until 1966, 8 years afterwards, that a tax was

20

first imposed on an S corporation.

21

QUESTION:

In

No, but Mr. Filler, he makes the

22

point that it might not have thought it was subject to

23

tax, but it didn't qualify as S corporation status, and

24

therefore you need to limit the period in which a tax

25

might be assessed against it when it made that mistake.

MR. FILLER:

The committee reports in the 1958

legislation specifically provide that the Congress knew

that a subchapter S corporation was not subject to tax.

QUESTION:

No, but the taxpayer might have made

a mistake in thinking it was qualified.

thought it was qualified as an S corporation when, in

fact, it was not, and the period of making that

determination is then set by the statute of limitations.

The person who

Yes, but in that case, the Congress

could not have drafted the second sentence saying any
