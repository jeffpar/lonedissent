ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILIP PALMER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PALMER:

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The basic issue in this case is whether section

12

506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and section 1322(b)(2) are

13

compatible and can be harmonized, or whether they are

14

hostile and conflict.

15

petitioner that they are compatible and they can be

16

harmonized.

17

It is the position of the

The function of Code section 506(a) is to divide

a claim into secured and unsecured parts.

20

one of which is a secured claim to the extent of the value

21

of the collateral, and the excess, or any amount above

22

that, becomes an unsecured claim.

23

A creditor who

We know that 506(a) does apply in Chapter 13,

24

because the Code tells us it does in section 103(a).

25

does it apply specifically to Chapter 13, Code section

apply, in an argument that is based upon the "other than"

clause that is found in section 1322, the clause that

7

reads "other than a claim secured only by security

principal residence."

The respondents argue that it does not

taken, they differ somewhat between themselves as to why

the "other than" clause excludes the application of

506(a).

14

focus on the word "rights" to tell us that the "other

15

than" clause modifies only the word "rights."

16

Nationsbanc, Fannie Mae, and the Chapter 13 Trustee look

17

to almost the same thing,

18

American Savings and Freddie Mac specifically

"rights of holders."

Whereas the Realtor Group, Fannie Mae again, and

19

Freddie Mac look to the word "claims," which they define

20

by going back to the definitional section of the Code to

21

determine that a claim is both a secured and an unsecured

22

claim -- indeed, a right to payment.

23

respondents look to the word "secured" or "secured claim"

24

together.

25

None of the

can be made first by the rule of last antecedent, which

2

was applied by the Ninth Circuit in the Bellamy case to

3

say you should look to the words that immediately precede

4

the clause in question.

5

looked to the adjective as well, secured claims.

Not just claims, but Bellamy

6

Another approach is that when several words are

7

followed by a clause and the clause is just as applicable

8

to the first word or the last word or middle words, that

9

clause should be read as applicable to all, which was an

10

approach espoused by Justice O'Connor and Kennedy in the

11

Ron Pair dissent.

12

Either approach is fatal, because either

13

approach puts the word "secured" back into 1322(b)(2).

14

And it is "secured" that is as fatal as an assassin's

15

bullet here, because a secured claim is determined by

16

506(a), and 506(a) is what the respondents must avoid.

17

Now if, as those opposed to the application of

18

506(a) would argue, that it was not meant to apply, one

19

thought which occurs is that the clause could have been

20

put at the very first of 1322(b)(2), or at the very end.

21

In effect, to start off by saying "other than" what I'll

22

call a homestead mortgage, the debtor may modify secured

23

or unsecured claims, and you could reach the same

24

reasoning at the end.

MR. PALMER:

1

It's been cited several times for

the grammatical analysis which, frankly, does appeal to me

at this moment.

(Laughter.)

5

MR. PALMER:

If you take -- or if you accept

6

that there is some uncertainty as to what the "other than"

7

clause applies, if you do not accept the Bellamy rule of

8

last antecedent, then we seem to fall right into the

9

analysis that you made -- with considerable and

10

respectable authority, I might add -- that it must apply

11

to the whole thing, rights of holders of secured claims.
But what are the rights of the holders of the

12

13

secured claims?

14

operative word,

15

about the rights of holders of secured, or partially

16

secured, or secured and unsecured claims, but only secured

17

claims.

And that brings us back, I think, to the
"secured claim."

We're not now speaking

There are some other points that lead to
somewhat the same analysis.

There is a question of whether or not Dewsnup

6

are aware that that was dealing to 506(d).

7

all are aware that that was -- the issue there was whether

8

or not an abandonment would revive the lien that appeared

9

by its terms to be cut off under 506(d).

And, of
All

And I think

And what I think

10

the Court held, and properly, was that 506(d) applies only

11

when it is not an allowed secured claim claim.

12

Because otherwise, Code liens would not pass

through the act the way that Act liens did.

That was the old Bankruptcy Act rule and it

20

was - - the Court found nothing in the Code or the

21

legislative history to indicate any intent to change that.

22

And the results of implying such a change would be a

23

rather unfair windfall to the debtor, because it would be

24

a permanent reduction even though it no longer served a

25

bankruptcy purpose.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Palmer, you may

resume.
MR. PALMER:

5

When we took our noon break, we

6

were discussing Dewsnup, and I'd like to pick up again at

7

that point.
Dewsnup, of course, was a Chapter 7 case.

8

Dewsnup did not involve homestead or residence; it
10

involved farmland in Utah.

And the argument was made in

11

Dewsnup that because there had been a valuation of the

12

property at a value well below the total amount, the total

13

amount of the debt, that that was something akin to

14

albatross branded to that property, even after that

15

property was abandoned from the bankruptcy estate so that

16

no distribution purpose in the bankruptcy remained.
The Court felt, and I think with justification,

17
18

that that was an unfair result.

1

appreciate in value, it would create a windfall to the

20

debtor.

21

that initial determination then determined that the Court

22

was uncomfortable in changing pre-Code law on ambiguous

23

language when there was no legislative history whatever to

24

support it.

25

Should the property

The Court found 506(d) ambiguous, and having made

4

true even if there is no objection to the exemption status

5

as homestead.

6

Chapter 13, of course, is one of the
The property is not abandoned

Exempt property does not pass from the Chapter

7

13 estate until after the plan has been confirmed, and

8

only then under 1327 does it pass from the estate.

9

purpose of determining exemptions in Chapter 13 is not, as

The

10

in Chapter 7, to have it pass from the estate, but to

11

determine whether or not the debtor must include in its

12

payments to creditors an amount equal to all of its

13

nonexempt property.

14

Now, that's all a Chapter 7 debtor does, is

15

surrender his nonexempt property.

But a Chapter 13 debtor

16

is required to do more than that.

The Chapter 13 debtor

17

must not only pay the value of all of his nonexempt

18

property, but must also pay his nondisposable income --

19

that is to the excess under his monthly budget, his

20

nondisposable income for 3 years to get the benefits of a

21

Chapter 13.

22

Chapter 13 is a favored chapter in bankruptcy,

23

and that has been a consistent purpose of Congress and

24

that's well reflected in legislative history throughout.

MR. PALMER:

1

Favored over Chapter 7.

Chapter 13 presents a man who is doing more than the legal

minimum that he would have to do to receive a discharge of

his debts.

to take an Internal Revenue Service, a tax debt otherwise

homestead, I will not deny, is a major benefit in Chapter

2

Well, there is another I should mention, and

3

that is that the grounds for objection to discharge in

That's really not a major consideration for the average

couple, but it's also a benefit of 13 over 7.

QUESTION:

Mr. Palmer, would you explain --

8

explain how your system works?

9

you have a single instrument of indebtedness that covers

10

both the secured and the unsecured claim, you can comply

11

with what you contend the provision says, and that is

allow the instrument to be modified as to the unsecured

claim, but not allow it to be modified as to the secured

claim.

Let me begin by explaining it in an

area where there is absolutely no controversy between the

17

parties, the $50,000 lien on the $100,000 automobile.

If we move it to a homestead, the result is

exactly the same unless, of course, the "other than"

QUESTION:

The

I mean, I'm

8

not asking for the difference between the secured and the

9

unsecured; I understand that.

But for the car or for the

10

homestead, I have the same problem about how you can --

11

how you can allow a unitary instrument which covers a

12

claim - - part of which is secured and part of which is

13

unsecured, but it's just one instrument.

14

How can you allow it to be modified as to the

15

secured portion of the claim but not as to the unsecured

portion of the claim, or vice versa, which is what

17

1322(b)(2) requires?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Mr. Palmer was correct when he said that this
case involves an interpretation of one or more statutes.

20

I would like to reread section

pertinent portions of that statute, and if the Court wants

22

to follow along, that statute is reprinted in page 3 of

Taking a plain and clear look at the language of

this statute, it appears that the word "rights" is the

6

grammatical object of the word "modify."

7

8

9

Modify.

We're modifying the rights.

In addition, the term "secured claim," again in
that first phrase, is preceded by the preposition "of."

It's our contention that those three words together, "of

12

of holder that the Congress was talking about when they

passed the statute.

interpretation that the same treatment must be accorded to

This Court,

that it is the creditor, not the debtor, who has the

2

benefit of increase in value, so as to avoid a windfall to

3

the debtor in that case.

4

Another right that the Dewsnup Court set forth was the

5

right to have the lien pass through bankruptcy unaffected.

6

In addition, this Court in the Barnhill case, in

I believe that's one right.

interpreting the words property and interest in property,

said that in the absence of a controlling Federal law,

answer your question -- yes, we may look to State law in

11

determining what rights are.
QUESTION:

12

Well I -- I'm surprised this is even

13

an issue.

I mean the provision doesn't mean very much if

it means the only rights you may modify are the lien

you can modify the rights that are the substantive rights

2

the discharge provision, section 1328, has an exception.

3

There are certain debts which are excepted to discharge in

Chapter 13 which are not excepted to in Chapter 7.

on the debt is on a date further into the future than the

Circuit, which was the first of the pro lien-stripping

1

cases, it appears from a reading of the text that that

2

court was predisposed as to its decision.

3

verbiage in that decision which says we can't believe that

4

a mortgage creditor wouldn't have an equity cushion in the

5

first place.

6

automatically take 506(a) and force it into 1322(b)(2),

7

just because 506 -- the Chapter 5 provisions of the

8

Bankruptcy Code are ones of general applicability to all

9

other substantive provisions.

10

There was some

They also do, as my opponent is suggesting,

The Wilson case is somewhat distinguishable.

11

The same result was reached there, but in that case the

12

creditor had additional collateral beyond the homestead.

13

And so the court, in part -- almost in passing, but it did

14

recognize that additional collateral beyond the homestead

15

was claimed by the mortgage company in that case, so that

16

case is somewhat distinguishable.

17

In the Hart case we have the same situation

18

where we had a mobile home on real property and other

19

collateral.

20

That's not what the court necessarily -- the facts that

21

that court necessarily relied on in reaching its decision,

22

but those were considered by that court in the result that

23

took place.

24
25

Again, that is somewhat distinguishable.

In the most recent case, the Bellamy case, the
court there takes a somewhat circular analysis of the

1

statutes in effect.

The court, by that time, had heard

2

several arguments.

And as a matter of fact, the creditor

3

involved in that case, the Federal Home Mortgage

4

Corporation, made the argument that it was rights and not

5

the secured claim that was subject to modification at

6

1322(b)(2).

7

The Bellamy court on one page of its decision

8

said yeah, that might be the case.

You may be correct in

9

saying that it is the rights that are the subject of the

10

adjective modified.

However, the real question is whether

11

it means unsecured rights or secured rights.
And then it goes on to make a statement about

12

13

the Code being a substantial change from the Act, which it

14

was.

15

of the statute, therefore we must only be talking about

16

secured claims.

And therefore -- without really looking at the terms

17

A couple of pages later in that same decision

18

that court goes and automatically, as the Hougland,

19

Wilson, and Hart courts did, take the "other than" phrase

20

and apply it to the words "secured claim," just as if it

21

had forgotten that it already used the rule of last

22

antecedent to apply to the entire phrase of that preceding

23

phrase.
