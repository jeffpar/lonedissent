ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS R. MURPHY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Although it was fully cognizant of the decisions

12

in Gray and Connolly, Concrete Pipe and Products asked for

13

hearing because it believes the assessment of withdrawal

14

liability under the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment

15

Act is unconstitutional when applied to the facts of this

16

case.

17

Concrete Pipe and Products requests the Court

18

rule that the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act is

19

unconstitutional under the substantive due process and

20

takings provisions of the Fifth Amendment.

21

the Court rule that the presumptions that are set forth in

22

29 U.S.C. 1401 deprive CP&P of the guaranteed right to

23

procedural due process.

Products from Gray and Connolly are the lack of connection

between Concrete Pipe and Products and those who will

benefit, the imposition of liability without

3

responsibility, the imposition of liability without regard

4

to the employee's expectations, the fact that the act uses

5

an irrational formula of increasing liability on the basis

6

of the amount of contribution, and the retroactivity

7

involved in this case.
With respect to the first fact, the lack of

8

9

relationship between Concrete Pipe and Products and those

10

who will benefit, it should be noted that this act would

11

require Concrete Pipe and Products to use its funds for

12

the generalized benefit and needs of members of society

3

who have never had any relationship with CP&P.

Yes, they have had a relationship.

voluntarily went into the relationship, and the

I do not believe that is correct.

That it's a defined plan.

You didn't

raise that.

3

MR. MURPHY:

We did not raise it, but we do not

4

necessarily concede that it is a defined benefit plan.

5

This is not an issue that is before the Court as we argue

6

the case today.

7

However --

QUESTION:

Well, I guess as we take it, we have

8

to consider that it is not, even though perhaps it could

9

have been argued differently below.
MR. MURPHY:

10

Perhaps it could have been argued

11

differently below, and it is -- certainly to assess

12

liability under the statute it has to be a defined benefit

3

plan, and certainly it has been considered, I presume, by

4

the deciding parties that it is a defined benefit plan in

5

assessing liability, since the statute clearly states that

6

there is no withdrawal liability with respect to a defined

7

contribution plan.

8
9

And we are not here asserting that it is not a
defined benefit plan, but we are asserting elements of it

you might not have assumed the risk for back in joining

to 50 percent of your net worth instead of 30 percent, as

2

ERISA had limited.

MR. MURPHY:

In - - it was a very contingent risk

under the original statute.

5

QUESTION:

Under the original statute there was

6

a contingent withdrawal liability of amounts up to 30

7

percent of the net worth.
MR. MURPHY:

8

But not as to defined contribution

9

plans, and it's clearly conceded that in 1976 everyone

10

believed this to be a defined contribution plan, so if

11

you're asking what the intent of the parties were in

12

entering this relationship and whether they agreed to

13

become liable for this type of debt when they entered the

14

plan on December 1, 1976, they did not agree to assume

15

liabilities to other employees in 1976.

16

notice of that.

17

They had no

The court from the very jurisdiction of which

18

this case arises, the Central District of California, had

19

just held that similar types of plans were defined

contribution plans.

They

were just wrong about that.
MR. MURPHY:

But if you -- if the issue is when

they - - there was no - QUESTION:

Well, the issue is what their

5

reasonable expectations were, and you don't have a

6

reasonable expectation that's contrary to the law.

7

9

MR. MURPHY:

Well, you have a reasonable -- they

entered a plan and they did nothing contrary to the law.
QUESTION:

No, but you're telling us you thought

10

it was a defined benefit plan and it turned out not to be,

11

or vice versa, and I mean, that's your problem.

12

see how that renders the Government's ability to deal with

13

you as someone charged with that knowledge who entered

14

into that arrangement, I don't see how it changes the

15

Government's ability to deal with you in that capacity.

16

MR. MURPHY:

I don't

Well, I think the Government's

17

ability to deal with us depends -- I think what we are

18

pursuing in this action is that the Government has been

19

recognized to be limited in its ability to deal with us,

20

and the Government's ability to deal with us is that it

21

can't charge one member of society for debts with which it

22

is unrelated, and there must be some reasonable

23

relationship in the legislation.

24
25

And in this instance we assert that there is no
reasonable relationship between CP&P and those employees

1

who -- or those employees of other employers who will

2

receive the benefit of these payments, and that is one of

3

the primary thrusts of our argument before you, Justice

4

Scalia.
As a matter of fact, it was interesting that in

5
6

the Connolly argument Mr. Felner, arguing on behalf of the

7

PBGC, indicated that it required the employer to pay for

8

consequences of its own conduct, and when he was asked by

9

one of the members of the court, what if it was not the

10

fault of the employer, and he specifically stated that's

11

not before us, and the takings clause involves transfers

12

of the property between unrelated parties.

that you would acknowledge that the company could be

liable for withdrawal liability up to 30 percent of its

976 that

1

they were a defined benefit plan, they would have

2

therefore, under force of statute, been constructively --

3

had constructive knowledge that they would have been

4

liable up to 30 percent.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MURPHY:

7

QUESTION:

You acknowledge that.
Correct.
Well, since you didn't raise the

8

question about this not being a defined benefit plan,

9

isn't that precisely how we have to view it here?

10

MR. MURPHY:

Well, we can view it as a defined

11

benefit plan here, but what we are trying to do here as I

12

understand it is to determine whether the application of

13

the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendment Act that was

14

passed in 1980 is applicable -- is constitutional under

15

the substantive due process clause and the takings clause,

16

and I think that that - -

QUESTION:

Well, the only thing that added was

18

that they could go up to 50 percent of the net worth.

Actually, it added it go up to any

amount well over 50 percent --

1

responsibilities under this act, we believe that they have

2

to establish a nexus between our conduct and our promises

3

and these payments, and what we're trying to demonstrate

4

is that there was no reasonable - - and as we state in our

5

reply brief, if you were going to analogize to a joint

6

venture or an insurance fund, there has to be some promise

7

made, and there's no reasonable basis for asserting a

8

promise.

9

The trust fund itself at that point in time was

10

representing itself to be a defined contribution plan.

11

The trust fund itself represented to the employers that

12

they would have no obligation for this.

13

itself represented to the employees that there were no

14

guaranteed benefits, and that was the -- those were

15

undisputed facts in this case, and based on those facts,

16

there was no knowing or no constructive promise by

17

Concrete Pipe and Products to pay the unfunded liability

18

of employees of other employers.

19

The trust fund

Your Honor, I also -- we've -- I've touched upon

20

it, we also assert that the fact that the statute imposes

21

liability based on the amount of contributions is itself

22

as demonstrated by the facts of this case unconstitutional

23

and irrational.

24
25

We have demonstrated by the facts of this case
that Concrete Pipe and Products has paid over two times

the amount of money necessary to fund the credits earned

2

by its employees, and that assumes all of its employees

3

vest, and we know, of course, under the Ponds case that

4

96 percent don't ever vest, and we didn't

time in business for them to vest while on our employment.

6

QUESTION:

have enough

Isn't it also the case that the more

7

you pay indicates the more likelihood of proportionately

8

large claims down the road?

9

MR. MURPHY:

Isn't that fair to say?

If it was related -- the more we

10

pay related in some way to the credits or the vesting of

11

employees, but --

12

QUESTION:

Well, you're now -- if I understand

13

you, you're now turning to a second argument, and that is,

14

during the period in which we paid our employees did not

15

work long enough to have vested benefits, but it seems to

16

me that that argument is foreclosed by the fact that the

17

very point of the act was to aggregate the periods of

18

employment, so I don't see how you can make that argument.

19

MR. MURPHY:

The argument I'm making with that

20

fact is that the point of the act and the point of prior

21

decisions is that an employer must pay for the liabilities

22

that arose as a result of its participation, and this

23

formula does not determine or even come close to

24

determining liabilities that arose as a result of its

25

participation.

1

They concede in their opposing brief that as a

2

result of our participation the employer not only funded

3

all the credits earned by its own employees, but also

4

twice that.

5

QUESTION:

Well, isn't it enough if you have a

6

reasonable plan that, in most cases, on average would

7

indeed hit the employer with the liabilities that arose by

8

reason of its participation?

9

Now, in some instances the scheme might not work

10

out that way, as in your case, because your employees quit

11

before the 10-year cliff vesting, but that doesn't make it

12

an irrational scheme, does it, just because in some cases

13

it won't work out perfectly?
MR. MURPHY:

14

Well, the law does not have to work

15

out perfectly, but the law has to have some relationship

16

between the harm -- the legislation has to have some

17

rational relationship between the harm that it is trying

18

to address and the remedy that is provided.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MURPHY:

In each case, or just generally.
Well, I would think that in general

21

the statute has to, but in general this formula does not

22

address that.

money.

The formula says that you simply give

24

We don't have any nexus between how much money

25

you gave and how much the liability is, and the more you

1

give the more you owe, so in our case if we had just paid

2

enough to fund our credits, the withdrawal liability would

3

have been approximately $55,000, but they don't even try

4

and make a relationship.

5

QUESTION:

It doesn't address it.

As Justice Souter says, ordinarily

6

the more you pay the more you do expose the - - the more

7

your operation does expose the fund to greater liability.

8

As a general rule that's true, isn't it?

9

MR. MURPHY:

I don't think so.

As a general

10

rule there has to be a relationship with how many hours of

11

credit or how many months and years of credit are earned.

12

As a general rule, at this point in time most employers

13

are paying far more than the credits that are being

14

earned, as a general rule.

15

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting the payments

16

should only relate to vested benefits?

point?

MR. MURPHY:

1

you should have no withdrawal liability if you contribute

2

for less than 10 years?

3

MR. MURPHY:

No.

My theory would be that we

4

would have no withdrawal liability if we contribute enough

5

to fund the credits that are being earned, because these

6

employees may perhaps go from our employment to another

7

employer and then finish their --

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, assume all of your employees

had no prior employment within the industry.

Then I think

10

under your theory you would have no withdrawal liability

11

until after a 10-year period.

12

13
14
15
16

MR. MURPHY:

That is one theory, but we don't

have to go that far, because our proof is -QUESTION:

It seems to me that's where your

argument takes you, if I understand it.
MR. MURPHY:

No.

We believe that we can step

17

back one step and say if we have fully funded all the

18

credits, assuming they will vest --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Well, but if your employees have no

vested benefits, they're fully funded by zero.
MR. MURPHY:

Well, there is no vested -- there

22

is no -- by definition, there is no vested liability at

23

that moment in time, but there are 2-1/2 years of credits

24

toward the 10 years, and we have fully paid for those 2-

25

1/2 years of credits.

QUESTION:

3
4
5

MR. MURPHY:

Yes, but you would then therefore

We would have no withdrawal

liability.
I would also like -- I believe that while we are

6

discussing this, address the presumptions issue, too,

7

since that is a significant issue.

8

9

Under 29 U.S.C. 1393, the trustees are to
determine the unfunded liability by using their best

10

estimate of anticipated experience in determining the

11

interest rates to apply.

12

Under the presumptions that are used in deciding

13

the issue, there is no opportunity to determine whether

14

they did or did not use their best estimate.

15

Under the presumptions, an employer could be

16

forced to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in

17

withdrawal liability when, under the most likely evidence,

18

there is no underfunding at all, and this can occur

19

because the trustee's determination as to the interest

20

rate must be accepted unless the employer proves by a

21

preponderance of the evidence that their determination is

22

unreasonable.

23

So while the statute says they're supposed to

24

use their best estimate, the statute does not allow

25

Concrete Pipe and Products to prevail in this case by
16

1

going in and addressing the proof issue that they did not

2

use their best estimate.

3
4
5

Because of that, this is not truly a
presumption.
QUESTION:

You say that the Constitution

6

requires that Congress say that if the trustees are going

7

to use their best judgment that they must prove by a

8

We have to prove that it is not --

10

used 6 percent for future funds which their actuary

admitted that it was on the low end of reasonable, it was

lower than their last year's 10 years experience, but he

also figured in that there might be future increases in

MR. MURPHY:

It is originally made by the

trustees are well aware of the various philosophies of the

8

actuaries when they hire them, so they can go hire

rates, they can hire actuaries that are known to be more

MR. MURPHY:

in an amount over that, you don't really have the problem,

MR. MILLER:

Well, that is not in the record, as

I understand it.

What is estimated is that the liability

of Concrete Pipe and Products exceeds 30 percent of the

9

which is the -- which wholly owns that subsidiary, so they

10

have not shown on an as-applied basis that there is even

Secondarily, the other misperception is that the

warrant that kind of adjustment of economic cost by

Congress.

2

the service credits that were being earned currently.

3

That is reflected in the table that is

4

reproduced in our brief that shows that today, or that as

of 1982, phe employers who remained in the plan were

paying $3 an hour for funding of previously promised

benefits and the projected cost of the current hour that

8

was worked was merely 55 cents, or thereabouts.
Now, those employees who earned -- such as

Concrete Pipe and Products who earned a contribution that

11

was worth 55 -- that would cost 55 cents today to pay it

an expectation, that when those employees actually retire,

they won't be receiving whatever the dollar -- unit dollar

Products by the actuary as a matter of withdrawal were

2

actually more generous than the assumptions that were

strictly being used by the actuary for the plan, because

4

they gave credit for higher interest rates being earned on

termination rates, and they only retained the 6 percent

is being unconstitutionally impaired by being unable to

13

challenge the actuary's assumptions, and what I'm

14

suggesting is that those assumptions, the only assumptions

15

that are different from a withdrawing employer than an

16

employer who purchased the plan are the five assumptions

17

that are set forth in the record, and those are generally

18

more favorable to the withdrawing employer than they are

for the ongoing employers.

The date that the employer withdrew

from the plan is also something that's determined by the

That's in this case --

That begs the question as to

certainly acknowledge that this language is inartfully

language, there are other determinations which the

12

trustees will make and that will apply to all employers

believe in order to ensure uniformity and consistency and

clear in analyzing what he did in that opinion, is that he

weighed the evidence and the other testimony that was

1

and there's many assumptions here, not just the interest

2

rate assumption to be examined, but what the actuary has

3

to do is really consider what liabilities are going to

4

have to be paid by this particular plan over 30, 40, 50,

5

maybe even 60 years into the future, as the various

6

participants retire.

7

Also in a plan like this one that was very

8

seriously underfunded, the actuary can't simply pick an

9

interest rate that may reflect what the current day's

10

investment returns are going to be, because he knows that

11

there's going to be money coming into the plan to make up

12

for that underfunding over all of that many years into the

future, and that he has to be very conservative about what

road.

reasonableness afforded these actuarial assumptions, what

we would be talking about is a situation where the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS R. MURPHY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. MURPHY:

Your Honor, the SDA presumptions,

8

the - - page 54 of the appendix clearly shows that the

9

trustees made a determination that the withdrawal occurred

10

in 1981 and the issue was whether the plant was mothballed

11

or permanently closed, and that was a determination that

12

the trustees made and it was challenged throughout the

13

entire proceedings and the presumptions -- there is no

14

disclaimer that the presumptions were not issued in their

15

favor and clearly the arbitrator was aware of the

16

presumptions because he cited the presumptions at page 400

17

and 401 of the joint appendix in issuing his second

18

decision, so it was a decision of fact, it was raised, it

19

is before the Court, and it needs to be determined whether

20

the trustee's decision on the A presumption is

21

appropriate.

22

With respect to the statement that Concrete Pipe

23

is on notice of the actuaries in 1976, there was no

24
