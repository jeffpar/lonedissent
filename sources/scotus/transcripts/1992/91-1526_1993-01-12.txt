ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN H. WESTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESTON:

9
10

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Congress designed RICO to eliminate any business

11
12

which has committed two or more predicate RICO offenses.

13

Such a business then becomes illegal and therefore

14

forfeitable.
Under the First Amendment, the presumption is

15
16

that no matter how many speech violations a business may

17

commit, it retains its protected status because all

18

unlitigated materials are presumed to be constitutionally

19

protected.

20

This case then presents the collision between

21

RICO and the First Amendment made inevitable by the 1984

22

congressional amendment adding obscenity to the predicate

23

list of RICO offenses.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well, is - - what -- which of our

cases do you rely on, Mr. Weston, for the proposition that

1

when obscenity is charged, it is presumed that it is not

2

obscene?

3

I take it that's what you're saying.
MR. WESTON:

The mere fact of an accusation, Mr.

4

Chief -- if I understand the Court's question, the mere

5

fact of an accusation does not serve to deprive the

6

material that is being challenged of its protected status

7

until such time as a court ultimately and finally

8

determines that it is not obscene.

That is certainly the

10

QUESTION:

Well, is that just a burden of proof

11

proposition?

12

criminal prosecution, you're presumed innocent until

13

you're found guilty.

14

You're saying that anyone is -- if it's a

MR. WESTON:

Not at all, Your Honor.

With the

15

-- with respect to the materials alleged to be obscene, a

16

host of cases, including all of the so-called search and

17

seizure cases, Marcus and Quantity of Books, Fort Wayne

18

Books, and a host of others, have all stood for the

19

proposition that even where material is being accused by

20

government of being obscene until such time as it is

21

finally determined to be obscene, it may not be removed

22

from the public totally because to do so would constitute

23

a total prior restraint.

24
25

And, in fact, in Heller, this Court went so far
in 1973 as to note that where a single motion picture film

1

was available to an exhibitor seized by government as part

2

of an obscenity prosecution, it was the duty of government

3

to make at least a copy of that film available or to

4

permit the defendant to have a copy of the film so that

5

the film might continue to be exhibited until such time as

6

it was ultimately determined to be obscene.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

That established that you can't

8

seize it under those conditions.

9

established the proposition that you're talking about.

10

MR. WESTON:

I don't think it

Well, with all respect, I see no

11

difference with respect to that, Your Honor, that if the

12

material is presumed to be protected until it is

13

ultimately deprived judicially of its protected status,

14

under that circumstance, it retains the presumption of

15

protectedness and simply may not be removed.

16

Our point, however, is with respect to this

17

case, that other than the seven items determined to be

18

obscene by the jury in this case, all of the other

19

material that was seized and destroyed by the Government

20

pursuant to the forfeiture order was neither alleged nor

21

proven to be obscene.

22

in that the nature of the material is totally irrelevant.

23

It might have been sexually oriented.

24

erotic, but it just might as well have been a book on how

25

to improve one's bridge game or build a garden or a

QUESTION:

Do I understand that all this

material was burned?

MR. WESTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is our

6

understanding that all of the hundreds of thousands of

7

books, magazines, videotapes, and films seized from the -

8

-representing the entirety of petitioner's inventory,

9

without any consideration or allegation or determination

10

of the protected or unprotected status of this material,

was seized by the Government, carted away, and burned in

MR. WESTON:

Much was probably adult video,

Justice Scalia.

3

First Amendment perspective, none of this material -- none

4

of the status -- none of the nature or determination or

5

character of the seized material was alleged.

6

under this Court's consistent decisions, the first

7

Amendment requires judicial blindness to the nature of the

8

material that was seized without any judicial focus

9

whatsoever.

And the destruction.
-- there was an objection here -The destruction -Once it's the Government's property

16

-- I suppose if the Government appropriately took control

17

of it and possession of it and ownership of it, I suppose

18

the Government can do with it what it wants, and the

19

objection to whether the Government ought to have burned

20

it or not probably should depend on what its character is.

21

Maybe the Government didn't want to be in the pornography

business.

3

MR. WESTON:

Absolutely, Your Honor, except to

4

the extent that the Government's destruction of the

5

material, certainly at a time of enormous national debt,

6

when all proceeds from sale of seized material would

7

certainly go to reduce that debt, bespeaks a governmental

8

purpose to remove protected or presumptively protected

9

materials from public circulation in a way that certainly

ought to arise the interest in anti -- in constitutional

11

protection of both this Court, as well as all of --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Weston, would you be making any

13

objection if what had been done was simply to require the

14

sale or disposition of all the presumptively protected

15

materials and to turn the proceeds over to the Government?

16

MR. WESTON:

That's a very tricky and

17

interesting question, Justice O'Connor, and the answer to

18

that is yes.

And frankly, the Government --

MR. WESTON:

In that case, an aspect of the

7

prior restraint doctrine would be satisfied or would be

8

finessed, in a sense, in that the public would not

9

necessarily be deprived of the materials.

But it

10

certainly doesn't deal with the right of the disseminator

11

to be able, in an untrammeled way, to continue to

12

disseminate presumptively protected materials --

QUESTION:

Well, for goodness sake.

Suppose the

Government decided because of the RICO violations to seek

MR. WESTON:

3

Yes, absolutely, and particularly

4

in the context of today's modern business world.

5

Corporations conduct most businesses.

a corporation is placed in jail, the corporation continues

7

to function, and the business continues to disseminate

As an officer of the Court, I advise, Your

Honor, that in 1969 or 1970 there was an obscenity

conviction of Ferris Alexander, followed some years later

10

by an acquittal, followed by almost 20 years of

11

nonprosecution at either the State or the Federal level,

the point being that under this statute, which is what is

obviously before the Court, what was done here was on the

There was -- the trial court

in its sentencing order noted it, and more importantly --

and I'm sure the Government would not contest this, but

15

at the forfeiture hearing, the Government put into

16

evidence in an attempt and, we respectfully submit, a

17

constitutionally irrelevant attempt -- but to somehow

18

characterize what the nature of the business was - - at

19

least 400 different, separate videotapes, none of which

20

had been alleged to be obscene, and perhaps 20 or 30

21

magazines and books and so forth.

items because the media items, large as they were,

2

whatever the number was, are an extraordinary minimal

3

portion of the terrible prior restraint that was imposed

4

here because 10 media businesses, the equipment necessary

5

to support the dissemination, plus the businesses

6

themselves, were taken over by the Government and closed

7

in a geometric fashion, totally therefore eliminating not

8

only the dissemination of all materials that presently

existed in the universe, but all those which might have

been created in the future which could have been

disseminated - -

QUESTION:

Mr. Weston, as I understand it, you

13

would have had -- you say you would not have any objection

14

to that under the First Amendment if the predicate

15

offenses had not been speech offenses.

16

MR. WESTON:

That is correct, Your Honor.

This

17

Court in Arcara made very, very clear that where the

18

predicate conduct has no communicative quality, whether it

be conduct with some -- as Justice O'Connor --

have no objection if it was a speech offense for the

predicate RICO offense, and the punishment, no matter how

forth.

There would be no per se

description of that penalty as being a per se prior

restraint.

what you're doing is combining two positions, neither one

of which alone would be - - would violate the First

19

when you combine the two, although they don't reinforce

20

each other as far as I can see, it is a First Amendment

21

obj ection.

22

And you say that somehow

There are two problems involved.

One is the

chill of the speech.

affected just as much by imprisonment as by taking away

MR. WESTON:

1

But we're not -- in this argument,

2

Your Honor, although this Court has frequently noted that

3

one of the vices of a prior restraint is the chill -- I

4

mean, in the Pittsburgh Glass Company case cited by the

5

Government, that's exactly what the concept is.
But the point that we're making primarily here

6

7

is that it is the prior restraint which invalidates in

8

every case the RICO sanction as - - the RICO forfeiture
sanction as applied to speech predicates because in every

10

case, speech will inevitably and immediately be

11

suppressed, the taking of the books, the closing of the

12

store, and so forth, whereas -QUESTION:

13

Speech will inevitably be suppressed

14

whenever you go after anybody in the media business under

15

RICO, whether it's for a speech offense or for any other

16

offense.

Right?

17

MR. WESTON:

18

QUESTION:

1

MR. WESTON:

I see the Court's point.
Yes.
But the classical difference is, as

20

pointed out by Near and in a host of subsequent cases,

21

there are special rules, special concerns, that we have

22

for the First Amendment, and the nature of the injunction

23

that was issued in Near would have caused no problem if,

24

as in Arcara, the predicate or triggering conduct had had

25

nothing to do with speech.

Why was it that this Court - - forgive the

1

2

rhetorical question, but this Court struggled and wrestled

3

with the problem in Arcara because, in fact, a bookstore

4

was enjoined.

5

triggering conduct either had no speech at all or had no

6

communicative content or no expressive conduct which was

7

involved in the sanction, that it simply was not a prior

8

restraint.

The ultimate conclusion was that where the

But the obvious implication, if not explication,

9
10

in both Chief Justice Burger's opinion and in Justice

11

O'Connor's concurring opinion is that where the triggering

12

activity was either speech or had communicative conduct

13

or, as Justice O'Connor noted, where a nonspeech

14

triggering statute had been used as a pretext to impose

15

censorship in the interest of decency, then there would

16

have to be a First Amendment analysis.

17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Let me begin where we left off in this

As I see it, until the very end of his argument,

16

Mr. Weston did not seem to be calling into question the

17

basic proposition that this Court established, after

18

hearing Mr. Weston's arguments to the contrary, in Fort

meaning of the First Amendment and that it can serve as a

QUESTION:

2

MR. STARR:

-- after R.A.V.?
To the extent that a final

3

determination has been made that it is obscene, the First

4

Amendment does not care and thus, in that sense, it is

5

invisible once it has been -- in terms of First Amendment

6

values, yes.

7
8

It is invisible to the First Amendment.

QUESTION:

Do you think that's consistent with

the holding in R.A.V.?
MR. STARR:

I don't think it's inconsistent with

10

the holding in R.A.V. because R.A.V. did not seem to call

11

into question -- or R.A.V. was obviously concerned with

12

content basis.

16

And I don't want to delay unduly in

The basic holding in R.A.V. -- and it was a

17

unanimous holding -- was that that ordinance had to fall

18

because it was content based.

serious as content based kinds of distinctions are,

20

obscenity is a different matter, and obscenity is not

protected within the meaning of the First Amendment.

This Court has held that as

Now, the second aspect - - and I think this is an

What I think we have seen today is, first of

all, an assault on Fort Wayne Books without his having

12

up being quite a remarkable proposition that is unfounded

13

in this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence.

14

That ends

What really seems to be at issue here is the

15

sense of disproportionality, that the defendant, the

16

petitioner, stands convicted of seven obscenity offenses,

17

and yet this entire business enterprise, including what he

18

considers presumptively expressive and protected

19

QUESTION:

Is there anything in the record to

show us the extent of the forfeiture or what was taken?
MR. STARR:

Yes.

I would have to know, first of all,

whether this was, in fact, corporate policy, board of

11

about a corporate forfeiture as opposed to the in personam

This is -But you just told me six is enough

MR. STARR:

I have suggested that it could be

enough as long as there is the threat of continuity, and

that is why I will not concede that any, other than the

most irrational, corporation would knowingly, as a matter

17

What this statute was aiming at and why this

predicate offenses is the kind of empire that we saw here,

20

one that is essentially given over to the display of

saw, to those --

Not at all.

Because of the

Government's concern about the nature of these materials

the Government did not need to go into the business or

And

10

so, the jury had before it the nature of this enterprise

and that prompted then at the forfeiture hearing the judge

to conclude that what had been established here was a vast

in terms of obscenity offenses in interstate trafficking

in obscene materials to take place.
That is to say, what is RICO getting at?

It is

an enterprise --an individual's use of that enterprise as

the vehicle for commission of criminal offenses.
