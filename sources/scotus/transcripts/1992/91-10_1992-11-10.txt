whether the defendant's conduct will harm competition.

One is unable to distinguish between conduct that may be

is undertaken for personal reasons.

as with -- as one who has 80 percent of the market.

5

Certainly, the party that has 2 percent of the market is

not likely to be able to affect that marketplace and harm

competition.

8

but there are other laws to deal with harm to another

competitor.

But moreover, the same conduct might be

There may be some effect on the competitor,

The Lessig rule converts a section 2, an attempt

10

11

to monopolize analysis, from one which requires an

12

analysis of the market and the impact on the market to a

13

per se analysis based solely on the defendant's conduct.

14

This Court has shown an aversion to extending the per se

15

rule, and that would be -- it would be even less

16

appropriate to extend it to a section 2 case.

17

The -- the Lessig rule has been rejected by

18

every other court of appeals for several reasons.

19

it permits there to be a finding of antitrust, of a

section 2 violation, without determining anything more

than whether or not the defendant's conduct has been

from that, the Ninth Circuit concluded that there was

14

the circuits will allow specific intent to be inferred,

15

the Ninth Circuit is the only one that disregards or

permits the inference of dangerous probability of success.

17

And our point is that nothing about the conduct or even

probability of monopolizing.

QUESTION:

1

The Ninth Circuit permits an

2

inference of dangerous probability of success without any

3

effort having been made to define the market?

4

MR. VAIL:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The --

5

the Ninth Circuit permits - - permits the dangerous

6

probability element to be based solely on conduct.

7

the charge specifically says if you find the conduct to be

8

predatory, or in this case the Ninth Circuit deemed if it

9

were unfair, then you may proceed to infer that there is a

10

- - that the defendant has a dangerous probability of

11

succeeding in monopolizing.

The --

And our position is there is nothing about the

defendant's conduct that can allow you to conclude that

that defendant has a realistic possibility or probability

of monopolizing any particular market.

QUESTION:

So if we agree with you it has to go

instructions?

4

MR. VAIL:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Uh-hum.

MR. VAIL:

We think that the Lessig instruction

7

is inappropriate and that the case ought to be reversed

8

with instructions that it may not use -- rely on the

9

Lessig rule.

10

The -- one aspect of the harm of the Lessig rule

11

is that it -- it truly harms competition.

12

example, a competitor with 80 percent of the market, to

13

claim that its 10 percent competitor has violated section

14

2 because the 10 percent competitor has been able to

15

secure 2 points of the market share from the 80 percent

16

competitor.

17

It allows, for

The 80 percent competitor may deem that -- the 2

18

percent -- may deem the smaller competitor's conduct to

have been unfair and may think that it was predatory,

however that is defined in that instance, and file a

section 2 claim.

cannot monopolize the market, but --

that the defendant can put in evidence that he's -- that

he's got 80 percent of the market, the defendant has 80

percent of the market, and therefore it's absurd to think

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

where we left off.

Justice Stevens' question, I think.

You were pondering the answer to

7

I understand the question -QUESTION:

question.

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Justice,

I don't -- I don't remember the

Do you want to tell me what it was?
MR. VAIL:

10

Mr. Vail, we'll resume

As I understand the question, it was

11

whether or not a defendant in the Ninth Circuit had the

12

ability to rebut the Lessig presumption by offering

13

evidence that it did not possess market share or market

14

power.

15

Is that -- if that's the question, I think that

16

certain panels in the Ninth Circuit do permit that.

17

Ninth Circuit jurisprudence is certainly confused from

18

time to time from one panel to the next, but I would say

19

that, on balance, yes, the Ninth Circuit would permit that

20

presumption, it would permit that rebuttal.

21

QUESTION:

The

Well, well, how do you explain the

22

result in this case, then?

Because -- is there -- is it

23

subject to reasonable -- could reasonable jurors differ on

24

whether or not there -- there was a dangerous probability

25

of success here?

MR. VAIL:

1

The

the instruction

first of

2

all, I think jurors could not distinguish.

3

the facts for the moment, I think the instructions simply-

4

permitted the jury to rely on -- to rely on conduct to

5

reach dangerous probability.

6

there was no instruction to that effect.

7

QUESTION:

But forgetting

In this case it was not --

Did -- but did the defendant put in

8

evidence that this is kind of silly, to assume a dangerous

9

probability when we have such a small percentage of the

10

market?
MR. VAIL:

11

There was extensive evidence

12

presented on behalf of the defense to the effect that this

13

was an extremely competitive market with no barriers to

14

entry, yet the verdict was against the defense.

15
16

QUESTION:

Did you object to the jury

instructions in the district court?

17

MR. VAIL:

We did, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

And did you raise the jury

19

instruction issue in the court of appeals?

20

MR. VAIL:

We did, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION:

Was the jury instructed in line with

22

Justice Stevens' questions, that the defendant could rebut

23

the inference, or was there an instruction on that point

24

at all?

25

MR. VAIL:

There was not, Your Honor.

1

QUESTION:

Did you ask for one?

2

MR. VAIL:

We asked for an Oahu Gas instruction

3

which allows the jury to look at procompetitive

4

justifications of conduct as well as anticompetitive

5

analysis, and that was objected to by the respondents and

6

the instruction did not go in.

7

One of the key points or key problems with the

8

Lessig rule is that it is so difficult to determine what

9

is predatory and what is not predatory in any particular

10

situation, that the dangerous probability requirement is

11

there as a safeguard to make sure that this is not -- that

12

the challenged conduct is not simply conduct done for

13

personal motives.

14

And it becomes very important in a section 2

15

case because section --we are trying to promote

16

competition and certainly the competitor who feels harmed

17

or who has lost market share may believe that to be for

18

predatory reasons or unfair reasons.

19

that such conduct does not implicate the antitrust laws.

20

But nonetheless,

Lastly, I'd want to point out to the Court that

21

the Lessig rule engenders unnecessary litigation, a

22

bushel-load, if you will, of litigation in the Ninth

23

Circuit, because of the enticement of treble damages and

24

attorney's fees.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. LONG:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

Liability for attempted monopolization in

13

violation of section 2 of the Sherman Act should be

14

limited to conduct that creates a realistic probability of

15

actual monopolization.

16

can be determined only by defining a relevant market and

17

considering the defendant's conduct in the context of that

18

market.

19

The probability of monopolization

Section 2 of the Sherman Act, unlike section 1,

20

applies to unilateral conduct.

As this Court recognized

21

in Copperweld, it is often difficult to distinguish robust

22

competition from unilateral conduct with long-run

23

anticompetitive effects.

24

unfair and predatory to an unsuccessful competitor, but

25

the antitrust laws protect competition, not competitors,

Vigorous competition may seem

1

and vigorous competition promotes the welfare of

2

consumers.

3

The Ninth Circuit's approach to attempted

4

monopolization brings many ordinary business torts within

5

the scope of the Sherman Act with its treble damages

6

remedy.

7

easy to bring and expensive to defend, an overexpansive

8

definition of the attempt defense is likely to chill

9

vigorous competition.

Because private antitrust actions are relatively

Nonantitrust laws are more

10

appropriate vehicles for remedying single firm conduct

11

that does not present a genuine risk of injury to

12

competition.

13

The probability of monopolization can be

14

assessed only by defining a relevant market; that is, a

15

market in which a monopolist could charge a price above

16

the competitive price for a significant period of time.

17

In general, a higher market share increases the

18

probability of market power, but market structure is also

19

relevant; factors such as barriers to entry and excess

20

capacity.

21

In our view, the probability of monopolization

22

generally should be considered as a threshold issue in a

23

section 2 case.

24

market position that there is no significant possibility

25

of monopoly, then judgment for the defendant is

appropriate.

The court and the parties can thereby avoid

costly and time-consuming inquiries into specific intent

and conduct.

I should add - -

QUESTION:

6

When do you get to -- when do you get

to being guilty of an attempt but not monopolization?

7

MR. LONG:

Well, when there's a dangerous

8

probability of success.

That's the formulation this Court

9

adopted in Swift & Company and -- and that is the standard

10

we think the Court should reaffirm in this case.

11

Obviously - QUESTION:

examining market power, is that it?

Typically, we think you must define a

And we would

Indeed, on that point, the point that the Court

20

granted certiorari on, the issue presented is whether in

21

every section 2 case, in every attempt to monopolize case,

22

Congress intended the separate offense of attempt to

23

monopolize to require, as a threshold matter in every

24

situation, a market analysis showing virtual

monopolization, or whether, as the Ninth Circuit provides,

in some limited, very narrow class of cases where the

2

conduct is manifestly anticompetitive and without

3

legitimate procompetitive justification.

4

We can pick up on Justice Holmes' comment in the

5

Swift Premium case and conclude, without a market share

screen, that the specific intent and consequent dangerous

probability exists.

8

dangerous probability element.

There is no case -- and the Walker

further development in the record below needs to be done

So it really leaves

So the issue of whether there's a dangerous

16

probability element at all in the attempt defense, or how

17

we should properly prove it, is certainly an issue that

18

this Court is now addressing, essentially, for the first

19

time since 1905.

20

The Ninth Circuit rule -- I might also add, the

21

screen that the -- the Solicitor General proposes, which

is the market power screen, is going to give -- is not

only an expensive impediment and a needless one, but it's

In the circumstance where a proposed monopolist

2

who has the specific intent, as Justice Holmes said, to

3

acquire that power, is engaging in conduct before he has

done significant harm to the markets, the screen will show

QUESTION:

Mr. Shohet, supposing we -- we accept

your submission that a dangerous probability of success is

not required in every single case, but wouldn't --

11

wouldn't you at least have to know what the -- what the

12

defined market was before you could convict someone of

3
4

attempting to monopolize it?
MR. SHOHET:

I would say no, Justice Rehnquist,

5

for this reason, although it is certainly a very important

6

and complex question.

7

where conduct is plainly anticompetitive, without

8

justification, market definition should be left to the

9

defendant to justify that conduct.

20

I would say that market definition

That the jury can properly infer when someone

21

appears to be acting with the specific intent to harm the

22

markets and has no legitimate procompetitive justification

23

for engaging in that conduct, that he is harming a market,

24

a relevant market.

in a criminal prosecution the State can charge you with
attempt to murder because you were running around with a
knife without saying who you were going to murder.
MR. SHOHET:

Well, it is a little like that,

Justice Rehnquist, but it's a little different than that
as well.

And it's different because, again, if we accept

Justice Holmes' definition of the attempt defense, that
when we have specific intent combined with dangerous
probability we have dangerous conduct.
Now I would agree with -- with Your Honor that,
in fact, no harm to -- can occur except in a relevant
market.

I accept that and we did allege a relevant market

and we put in evidence of the relevant market.

But my

point is it's sort of a burden-shifting issue.

Once you

show the plainly anticompetitive conduct, why not shift
the responsibility to the defendant to then define the
market?
QUESTION:

Well, ordinarily the burden of proof

is on the plaintiff to prove all of the elements of the
case.

2

always harmful -- in this case per se unlawful under

3

section 1, that is always harmful to the markets and never

justified.

5

And the Ninth - - the wisdom of the Ninth

6

Circuit, if there is any, it says in that circumstance

we're going to permit but not require an inference from

8

the very conduct that is inconsistent with an intent other

than to harm the markets.
QUESTION:

MR. SHOHET:

As a matter of policy, should we

let some big -- some of the big monopolist fish through

the net simply because we may catch a few people who have

the specific intent to hurt the market but are just very

That's the policy question

with the exclusionary conduct creates the danger to the

that the record demonstrates that that's precisely what we

have, conspiratorial per se conduct, that conduct being an

agreement in January of '82 to fix prices, that the

wholesalers would resell the product to their retailers,

16

an agreement on their part to set up resale price

maintenance agreements with their retailers and an

18

agreement to police those retailers to eliminate any price

19

cutting or discounting by those retailers.

A particularly pernicious form of resale price

22

there was no interbrand competition or little interbrand

1

between each other and so they would devote shelf space to

3

Now there's a raging debate between the

economists as to whether resale price maintenance should

of resale price maintenance.

The evidence was that petitioner was a

evidence of a meeting, that he would slow down shipments

to the retailers to keep them from cutting the price, and

12

that he was doing quite a good job.

13

It also has a horizontal component to it because

14

the specific meeting testified to by the -- the -- the

15

marketing manager was called by the other national

distributor of medical products, and the testimony was

that it was in furtherance of an understanding to keep the

such a way, with -- with focus on the manufacturer rather

I'd like to talk a little bit about the Ninth

10

Circuit's approach and the attempt defense, just to -- to

focus exactly what it did and what it did in this case.

12

There are three prongs to the section 2 attempt approach

Moreover, what section 2 does address itself to

are going to do that through joint conduct.

Joint conduct is the most harmful conduct to the

markets, and there's no reason for the Court to develop a

rule that simply writes joint conduct out of section 2.

The Ninth Circuit has thrown

specific question, where there's a price fixing proposal

2

on the table, I would submit that it's a sensible rule

3

that rather than require a market screen and all of the

complexity and difficulty of market definition and proof,

5

we start with the proposition that in that case it is

6

likely -- it is reasonable to infer specific intent and

7

dangerous probability.
QUESTION:

8

9

It's kind of interesting because your

theory would really create an attempt defense in

10

section 1.

An attempt to engage in, at least, the worst

11

kinds of section 1 violations would be unlawful --

12

MR. SHOHET:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SHOHET:

Right.
-- but unlawful under section 2.
Except to bring it under section 2,

15

you impose on yourself an additional screen of specific

16

intent, which is not present under section 1, and it's a

17

mere inference, not a rebuttable presumption.

18

Mr. Vail's example of the 80 percent market share

defendant, they're permitted to come forward and

20

presumably that would go out on summary judgment because

the court would screen that case right out, and saying

it's totally implausible for there to be any harm to

still a good and viable element under section 2 in the

2

Ninth Circuit.

It merely limits to a very narrow case.

In most cases, and the case law under the Ninth

3
4

Circuit established this -- in most cases there is a

5

requirement for a market analysis because we can't know

6

that it's dangerous, we can't form a judgment about it in

7

the ambiguous conduct.

unambiguous, why throw the plaintiff out on the street for

lack of a market analysis when we can start with the

But where the conduct is

inference that there is market danger and intent, and

11

shift over to the defendant to put on all the market

12

evidence it wants.
And, indeed, on a summary judgment, if there's a

13
14

significant implausibility factor to that position of the

15

plaintiff, these cases are not going to go to the jury.

16

And the Ninth Circuit jurisprudence in the last 10 years

reflects that most of these cases are thrown out because

they reflect ambiguous conduct or because they're --

there was a variety of

But Mr. Shohet really put the question very

8

well.

He said, do we really need to know what power a

9

defendant has in the market,

is that really something we

10

need to know.

And I think the answer is yes.

I think the

11

Court has said it's yes, and it makes intuitive sense.

12

We're concerned in section 2 about

13

monopolization, and if a defendant doesn't have the

14

possibility or the reasonable probability of monopolizing,

15

we're simply not concerned with section 2 of the Sherman

16

Act.

QUESTION:

Do you agree that your instruction on

with Lessig is that it allows defendants who have no
