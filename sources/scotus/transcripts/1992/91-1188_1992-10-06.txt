ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES CHING

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. CHING:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

Section 1915(a) permits persons to proceed in

12

forma pauperis upon the filing of a proper affidavit of

13

indigency.

14

corporations may also apply and whether, therefore, they

15

are persons under the language of the statute.

16

The issue today is whether associations or

The relevant events concerning this statute are

17

few and can be briefly described.

18

forma pauperis statute was limited to citizens, and prior

19

to 1959, the case law is perfectly unequivocal.

20

citizens were only natural persons.

21

corporations, and a fortiori, they were also not

22

associations.

23

QUESTION:

Prior to 1959, the in

They were not

Well, Mr. Ching, weren't corporations

24

considered to be citizens at least for purposes of Federal

court jurisdiction?

QUESTION:

How do we know whether it would have

been rejected in the Ninth Circuit, for example?

18

MR. CHING:

Well, I would guess that the period

of time between 1938 and 1959, in which no single case

20

arose, indicated that there was some unanimity on the

point.

resident aliens alone substituted for the word, citizen,

2

in the in forma pauperis statute the term, person.

3

for a period from '59 to '69, utterly no litigation at all

4

on the point.

5

Then

What this would indicate to me, in sum, is

6

number one, the statute, whether referring to citizen or

7

to person, never referred to artificial persons.

8

referred to natural persons.

9

It only

Secondly, in the amendment in 1959, the language

10

is we would extend the same privilege as is now afforded

11

citizens to resident aliens.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CHING:

14

QUESTION:

What about the House report?

Did

that say the same thing?

17
18

That is the language of the report,

the Senate report, in the statutory history.

15
16

That's the language of what?

MR. CHING:

I do not -- I only had the

Congressional News report.

19

I do not know.

However, drawn from this examination of the

20

statutory reports, there are two principles:

21

the intent of the legislation was only to include another

22

category of natural persons, residential aliens; and

23

principle number two, that Congress has been extremely

24

parsimonious in extending the benefit of IFP to any other

25

groups.

QUESTION:

8

To parsimoniously extend the

That's a principle or that's just an

observation I suppose.

9

MR. CHING:

I guess it's an observation.

10

generalization which I think is fairly drawn from the

11

statutory history.

12

QUESTION:

Well, has the Congress rejected from

13

time to time suggestions to expand the in forma pauperis

14

statute?

15

MR. CHING:

QUESTION:

17

evidence for your supposition.

18

MR. CHING:

I do not know, Your Honor.
Well, then I don't think you have any

All right.

Well, in any case, the

19

single instance in which they have expanded it with an

20

enactment has been this 1959 amendment.

21

The core of the minority position is - - takes

22

note of the fact that in 1948 the section 1 of title 1 was

23

amended to create persons --a definition of persons that

24

included corporations and associations.

This would seem

to be an irrelevant definition.

It is even more

irrelevant in light of the qualification that is explicit
in section 1, that unless the context is consistent with
the definition of persons, it is not to be used.
QUESTION:

Well, it says unless the context

otherwise requires, doesn't it, in - MR. CHING::
QUESTION:

Unless the context otherwise -Or unless the context indicates

otherwise.
MR. CHING::

Indicates.

Of course, the meaning

of context is not spelled out, but surely context must at
least include the events surrounding the amendment in
1959, as well as the cases from the -QUESTION:

So, you say context means more than

the words of the statute itself.

Context means the

environment for the milieu in which the statute was
adopted?
MR. CHING:

Certainly.

Yes, that is my point,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:
MR. CHING:
QUESTION:

And the legislative history.
Certainly, Your Honor.
Section 1 then requires us to look at

legislative history in every case to be sure it doesn't
otherwise require.
MR. CHING:

I would think so, Your Honor.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. CHING:

A statutory directive.
And since, in fact, we are

3

attempting to implement the intent of Congress, then

4

certainly we must understand what they mean if they use

5

the word, person.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. CHING:

8
9

What does context not include?
I would not -- I would think that

the use of such a general term would not exclude much.
QUESTION:

Anything?

Anything at all?

I mean,

10

I don't know why they just didn't say then unless there is

11

some reason to think otherwise --

12

MR. CHING:

13

QUESTION:

And certainly --- the word, person, means, you know,

14

but they didn't say that.

15

indicates otherwise.

16

MR. CHING:

17
18

And there is nothing in section 1 to

indicate what context means.
QUESTION:

Well, I think the word, context,

19

comes from the word, text.

20

surrounding text.

21
22
23

They said unless the context

MR. CHING:

Context.

It means the

there's extratextual.

The

1

statutory language.
MR. CHING:

2

Don't you think that's what it means?
If that were so, that would indicate

3

a restriction to only the statute which purported to

4

define person in a separate and distinct manner.

5

cases, the FTC case and so on, dealing with the use of

6

person doesn't seem to indicate such a narrow restriction.

7

QUESTION:

The

Well, really the first definition in

8

the dictionary is that it is a connection of words that

9

-- excuse me.

The parts of a discourse that surround a

10

word or passage and can throw light on its meaning.

11

under that definition -- it's the first definition -- it

12

would indicate that we look just to the statute.

13

MR. CHING:

14

its meaning.

15

the text first.

17

There's no doubt about that.
But now, I said gist of the statute.

That's a plausible interpretation of context, is it not?

18

MR. CHING:

19

QUESTION:

20

Well, anything that would indicate

Yes, I would think that you would look to

QUESTION:

16

So,

Yes, it certainly is.
If we don't go beyond the text, do

you lose?
MR. CHING:

21

No.

I do not believe that I lose if

What's your best textual argument?

MR. CHING:

My best textual argument is that

1

which I led with; that is, there has been a consistent

2

restriction to natural persons both in case law and in the

3

bill.

4

QUESTION:

5

text of the statute when you say that?

6

your parsimony argument, and you have to go to -- I guess

7

you have to look at a lot of congressional history beyond

this statute.

Scalia suggested, is there anything in the text that

11

s

Well, aren't you getting beyond the

QUESTION:

What about the requirement for an

affidavit?

15

MR. CHING:

The requirement for an affidavit is,

16

of course, tied up with the complications of a corporate

17

identity.

18

QUESTION:

It's not normal to talk about a

19

corporation making an affidavit, is it?

20

can't get IFP status unless you make -- unless the person

21

makes an affidavit that he is unable to pay such costs.

22

MR. CHING:

23

QUESTION:

Well -Such affidavit shall state the nature

24

of the action, blah, blah, blah, and affiant's belief that

he's entitled to redress it.

say that the corporation can make an affidavit through one

2

of it's officers, but --

3

MR. CHING:

4

QUESTION:

5

It could --- it's sort of a stilted use there,

isn't it?

6

MR. CHING:

Well, it could not make it directly

7

as implied by the plain meaning of the statute, and I

8

would think that tied up with that is the inability to

9

determine what the corporate assets are for the purposes

10

of the litigation at hand.

11

QUESTION:

So --

I suppose without the definition of

12

person, the general definition of person, if that weren't

13

in the statutes, I suppose you would win.

14

MR. CHING:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, unequivocally.
Because you don't usually call a --

16

in common parlance, you wouldn't call a corporation a

17

person.

18

MR. CHING:

19

QUESTION:

No, I would not think so.
I suppose the word, poverty, in the

20

statute also helps you.

QUESTION:

corporations?

4

5

We refer to corporations with financial

MR. CHING:

Yes.

I mean, there are many other

6

technical terms that would more accurately describe a

7

corporation without funds to pursue litigation.

12

QUESTION:

So, you don't pin much on the term,

poverty, in the statute.
MR. CHING:

I do not think it is as significant

as the other point Justice Scalia made.
QUESTION:

I suppose part of the context is also

13

the fact that this statute is providing for treatment as

14

an indigent and providing public funds to be used for

15

purposes that otherwise people are required to pay for.

16

That's the part of the context, right?

its debt, its assets are much less than its liabilities

2

-- do you think that would automatically mean that it

3

could be -- it could file an affidavit that is -- that it

4

is entitled to be treated as a pauper?

5

MR. CHING:

There is no reason to think that the

6

bankruptcy -- any of the prevailing tests for determining

7

it bankrupt would automatically be imported into the in

8

forma pauperis statute.

9

QUESTION:

Well, a corporation might have --

10

could be taking -- could be put in involuntary bankruptcy

11

or take voluntary bankruptcy even though it has an income

12

of maybe $100,000 a year.

13

MR. CHING:

Certainly, and the practical --

14

QUESTION:

And yet, I don't -- I doubt if it

16

would be granted in forma pauperis status, would you?
MR. CHING:

I hesitate.

I hesitate to answer

17

for the Ninth Circuit.

believe income flow is one of the key provisions for

19

determining in forma pauperis status.

20

QUESTION:

However, in all seriousness, I do

Well, there's a difference also.

21

When an individual says that that person is unable to pay

22

sort of thing.

1

into consideration?

2

MR. CHING:

It is simply stating that it is

3

unable to engage in the business for which it was created,

4

and therefore, it would seem to me a lesser claim than

5

that of bread on the table for an individual.

6

the in forma pauperis statute was more directed to the

7

individual in dire straits than a corporation in dire

8

straits.

9

QUESTION:

Well, now, Mr. Ching, in this

10

instance, if we have an association of prisoners who by

11

-- I guess you concede they individually didn't have any

problems with the case is the lack of development of facts

QUESTION:

So, it wouldn't have been impossible

4

for this group to have filed on an indigent basis, in

5

effect, through the mechanism of a class action.

6

MR. CHING:

Well, certainly, Your Honor, I think

7

that they could have pursued a class action.

8

that's what they should have done.

9

QUESTION:

I think

But, Counsel, isn't that -- isn't

10

there a danger there that just because the named plaintiff

11

is indigent, could he bring a class action in forma

QUESTION:

What I'm suggesting is that I think

that you will have more in forma pauperis actions allowed

if you allow class actions with just an indigent named

Thank you, Mr. Ching.

MR. WEISSELBERG:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
There are three main reasons why the Men's
Advisory Council may sue in forma pauperis.
First, under the plain and unambiguous statutory
language, an association may proceed in forma pauperis.

16

Second, if this Court does decide to look to the

17

legislative history, nothing in the legislative history is

18

contrary to the plain language of the statutes.

19

And third, the statutory context, meaning the

20

overall text, structure, and purpose of the in forma

21

pauperis statute, does not require a restricted definition

22

of the word, person.

Congress was aware of its own dictionary, and so when

Congress reenacted the law using the phrase, white person.

Congress was fully aware that the phrase would be

construed to cover artificial entities, as well as

The petitioners' claim here is that Congress was

silent regarding whether an association may proceed in

loud and clear in the statute.

14

Congress chose that word knowing that the word, person,

15

has a specific standard statutory meaning.

16

In amending section

The petitioners want that phrase, person, in

17

section 1915 to be read as natural persons, but if

18

Congress had wanted only natural persons to proceed in

19

forma pauperis, it would have said so in the statute.

20

statute would have said that natural persons can proceed

21

in forma pauperis or that individuals can proceed in forma

22

pauperis or that citizens and aliens can proceed in forma

23

pauperis, or Congress would have taken the time to craft a

specific definition of the word, person, just as Congress

25

has done in a variety of other statutory schemes.

to that, Your Honor.
First, again, when Congress changed the statute

There are a few cases that come to

that case, this Court interpreted the phrase, sanction, or

the word, sanction, and the Court said that sometimes

And there the Court compared

10

the use of the word, sanction, in several different

subsections of the particular enactment.

certain that the courts will have difficulty assessing
when organizations can go in forma pauperis.
And I don't really that this is something which
will come up much.

I mean, frankly, the Southern District

of New York decided the Harlem River case 15 years ago.
In that case, the district court held that associations
and corporations are persons within the meaning of the in
forma pauperis statute.

I think this Court can take note

of the fact that the Southern District of New York is a
district which has quite a number of corporations and
associations, and yet, since the Harlem River case, no
case has reached the Second Circuit on this issue.
There's no other reported case in the Southern District of
New York.

I don't know that this is something which is

going to come up often.
Also, I would point out that if organizations
are bringing lawsuits on behalf of individuals, it may
well be that there would be a reduction of litigation in
the Federal court because an association suit may replace
suits of many individuals.
So, first, I don't know that this is something
which will cause a problem for the courts, and I don't
know that it will come up very often at all.
I'd also like to point out the in forma pauperis
statute, section 1915, doesn't even give guidelines as

\
2

courts have managed to fashion their own rules to

determine when individuals can proceed in forma pauperis.

4

And the courts have developed that jurisprudence and have

5

not had difficulty in developing it.

6

the courts, if associations or corporations do

7

occasionally sue under this in forma pauperis statute in

8

the future, will have no difficulty developing that

jurisprudence either.
I know that the petitioners have suggested that

And I'd suggest that

11

legislative history means context and that the Court ought

12

to look to legislative history.

13

means overall text and purpose of a statute, and that if

14

this Court looks to the legislative history in this case,

15

it does it for the same reasons that the Court ordinarily

16

looks to legislative history, and that is if the statute

17

is deemed ambiguous in any respect or if there is an

18

argument that interpreting the statute literally would

19

frustrate the intent of the legislators.

20

I'd suggest that context

I think that the language of the statute is

21

clear.

The statute is not ambiguous.

Section 1915 says

22

that persons may proceed in forma pauperis, and 1 U.S.C.,

23

section 1 says that persons include associations.

24

it's not an ambiguous statute and one should not look to

25

the legislative history under that -- for that reason.
