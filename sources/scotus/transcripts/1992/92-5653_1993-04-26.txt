ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. TIGAR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TIGAR:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice of the United

States, and may it please the Court:
Dorsie Johnson was 19 when he accepted the gun

10
11

from Amanda Miles and, at her urging, entered the Allsup's

12

convenience store and shot Jack Huddleston to death.

13

In the punishment phase of his trial for capital

14

murder, the jury was limited to answering two special

15

issues under the former Texas statute.

Issue one,

16

deliberately.

It mandates a

17

narrow mens rea inquiry into the deliberateness of the act

18

that proximately caused death.

19

The statute has a text.

The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, whose cases

20

respondent hardly cites and does not discuss, has so

21

construed it.

22

of its brief to how the issue might be construed is plain

23

wrong.

24

Court of Criminal Appeals said that the fact the defendant

25

had a gun was enough.

Indeed, respondent's reference at page 40

became an adult at 18?

MR. TIGAR:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.
So, how long in your view is youth a

21

factor then in a case such as this?

22

treated, for all purposes in Texas, as an adult at the age

23

of 18.

Well, why do you say that, and what

I find that a difficult aspect of the

MR. TIGAR:

6

By the respondent referring to

I submit that one could look first

7

to respondent's concession here that Jurek was youthful

8

although he was 22.

9

Justice O'Connor, the consensus that in the States that

But also there is this consensus,

10

give an instruction on youth, the generality of those

11

States -- and the roll call was called in Stanford v.

12

Kentucky -- leave it to the jury, guided by cautionary

13

instructions.
Another approach is to say up to the age of 21

14
15

or 22.

The scientists we have spoken -- whose works we've

16

cited, speak of the time of adolescence which lasts

17

somewhat longer, perhaps 23 or 24.

18

that dates to a statute of the 4th century B.C., to

19

antiquity, cut off the age at 25.

The legal tradition

20

It seems to us that 19 surely falls within the

21

range as to which there is unanimity among the States - -

1

of what?
MR. TIGAR:

2

The Lex Plaetoria of the 4th century

3

B.C. as interpreted by Justinian and the institutes would

4

have extended mercy up to the age of 25 despite the coming

5

to majority at 14, which was the general rule under Roman

6

law, Justice Scalia.

7

we speak there.
QUESTION:

8

9

Did that relate to the time the crime

was committed or to the age of the defendant?
MR. TIGAR:

10
11

That's the legal tradition of which

To the time of the transaction under

review, Justice Scalia, as I understand the institutes.

12

The point, however, for present purposes is not

13

an idle stroll through antiquity, is that the statutes as

14

to which --of which the Court spoke in Stanford v.

15

Kentucky focused on this factor of adolescence.

16

If we're looking not for numbers, Justice

17

O'Connor, but for characteristics, I think there's no more

18

eloquent statement of what you are like at 19 as an

19

adolescent than Dorsie Johnson's father's statement.

20

he said, that's a foolish age.
QUESTION:

21

19,

This young man, Mr. Tigar, had

22

tragedies in his early adolescence.

His mother was killed

23

and his sister murdered I think, and it caused him severe

24

problems.

25

relevant than youth per se to a reasoned moral judgment,

It seems to me that that might even be more

1

if that is indeed a constitutional requirement.
I'm not quite sure why you focus your argument

2

3

on youth, and I suppose what I'm getting to is that in all

4

of the cases that we've had -- held for this case that's

5

being argued today, some 22 cases, there are factors such

6

as this.

7

is ultimately going to be that there should be a general

8

instruction on mitigating evidence.

9

And it seems to me that what you're arguing for

MR. TIGAR:

No, Justice Scalia, we do not submit

QUESTION:

MR. TIGAR:

13

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Justice

Kennedy.

15

I'm Justice Kennedy.

We do not submit that is constitutionally
required.
First, with respect to the family factors that

17

you mentioned, Justice Kennedy, of course this is a

troubled background.

potentiates the effect.

so.
Again, I think if we look at the issue of

3

deliberately, this Court of Criminal Appeals has looked at

4

that issue with respect specifically to youth.

5

Zimmerman v. State, on the 9th of April 1993, they said

6

that youth can be aggravated, indeed, that it was properly

7

so considered in Zimmerman's case.

8

9

And in

And, therefore, the Court of Criminal Appeals
has shut off any consideration of youth for whatever worth

10

youth may have as a mitigating factor.

11

a direct assault upon the language that you, Justice

12

Kennedy, used for the Court in Saffle v. Parks at page 493

13

in which you said that the State must not cut off full and

14

fair consideration of mitigating evidence.

15

QUESTION:

We regard that as

Well, but the evidence was introduced

16

in this case and counsel is not confined at all in their

17

closing arguments.

18

your submission in this case, any different than these

19

other tragic instances that we've adverted to and that are

20

present in this case and so many other capital cases.

21

And my question is why is youth, under

MR. TIGAR:

Justice Kennedy, first with respect

22

to the factual premise, of course the jury heard evidence

23

of youth in this case.

judge, however, shut off their inquiry rejecting proposed

25

instructions the defendant had proposed, and instructing

that had been submitted to them.
Second, Justice Kennedy, we know, after Graham

this Court has done since 1984, and that's the answer it

respectfully seems to us to your second question.

invited, indeed required, that kind of careful look.

9

take the Graham conclusion as being reasonable jurists

Graham
We

10

would not in 1984 have been compelled to the conclusion we

11

seek.

So, I'd like to look at that.
The key phrase we submit is reasoned moral

13

response not because we think the phrase is talismanic,

14

but because it well describes what the Court has done

No matter how egregious

But why is this youth in this regard

20

different from a tragic occurrence during adolescence?

21

What's the difference?
MR. TIGAR:

22

The difference is that this Court's

23

decisions, particularly Lockett and Eddings, say that,

24

recognize that youth has this uniquely powerful mitigating

25

force.

That tradition of Lockett and Eddings, which was

summoned up again in Stanford v. Kentucky, is what

2

identifies youth as such a factor.

3

background may also be such a factor, and the Court may

4

have to reach that in another case.

5

A troubled family

The question for us, therefore, Justice Kennedy,

6

is how is it, since 1984 or 1987, has the teaching of

7

Lockett and Eddings that identifies this uniquely powerful

8

factor focused on the sentencing process, and as to that,

9

we put alongside Sumner v. Shuman, Stanford and Penry

because there you rejected the categorical imperative of

You thrust back again on the sentencer this duty of

13

QUESTION:

Your description of what the Texas

14

courts hold these factors to be, namely, narrow, factual

15

inquiries, suggests to me that -- although you purport to

16

be making only an as-applied challenge, it seems to me

17

that if we accept that description, this scheme is

18

invalid.

19

Kennedy is asking.

20

Texas system, this is invalid in all cases, not just for

21

youth.

22

Maybe it's the same question that Justice

MR. TIGAR:

If we accept your description of the

The State and the amici have made

23

that argument.

24

Jurek should be overruled, that this Court needs to

25

overrule Jurek.

Let me be clear.

We do not believe that

1

Court upheld the Florida sentencing statute on its face,

2

and yet, when Hitchcock v. Dugger came to the Court in an

3

as-applied challenge, a unanimous Court said that the

4

statute as applied to that particular defendant didn't

5

pass constitutional muster.

6

Proffitt and Hitchcock, we suggest it could be done here.

If it could be done between

And Penry puts paid, it seems to us, to the
argument that Jurek needs to be overruled.
QUESTION:

9

Yes, but Proffitt didn't -- I mean,

10

we had never accepted the proposition that the State

11

inquiry was a narrow, factual inquiry of whether there

12

was, as you say there is in this case, premeditation or

13

deliberateness.

14

you say?

15
16
17

There either is or isn't.

And what do

Two blinks of an eye or something -MR. TIGAR:

Well, that was the prosecutor's

words, Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

But, I mean, if that's what this

18

means in the Texas statute, surely it does not allow a

19

reasoned moral response.

20

MR. TIGAR:

The two special issues that were

21

before the Court in Jurek, Justice Scalia, had at 1976

22

been considered only in two cases by the Court of Criminal

23

Appeals, Jurek and a case called Smith.

24

in Jurek was whether the Texas statute, like the others

25

argued that day, impermissibly vested undue discretion in

Indeed, the issue

1

jurors.
So, what we are saying is that as applied, as it

2

3

has played out, the jurisprudence of the Texas Court of

4

Criminal Appeals has robbed the first special issue of any

5

force it might have had to make this reasoned moral

6

response.

7

under this statute.

8

Appeals has looked at this first special issue and never

9

found the evidence wanting.

Hundreds of people have been sentenced to death
Fifty-six times the Court of Criminal

With respect to the second special issue,

in the

11

Zimmerman case, acknowledging, quoting Justice Souter's

12

dissent that it could be and was appropriately used as

13

aggravating, even in mental illness cases, these disturbed

14

cases,

15

well, mental illness, well,

16

they go ahead and deny a mitigating instruction on Penry

grounds, so that if,

invitation tendered by any lawyer of whose existence I am

2

aware to recognize what this Court has done since 1987.
And I know, Justice Kennedy, as you said, that

3
4

this is not a Teague case, but Graham v. Collins was, and

5

the issue was here.

6

Jurek, and I know other Justices are concerned about it.

7

There is a reliance interest that the State can

8

legitimately have in opinions of this Court, such as

9

Jurek.

And Justice Scalia has asked me about

We submit that the reliance interest is fully

10

satisfied by holding these claims barred on Federal habeas

11

corpus.
On direct appeal, the State, it respectfully

12

13

seems to us, must take the consequences of not having paid

14

careful attention to what this Court has done since 1987

15

because having rejected the categorical imperatives of

16

death and life, you've put the sentencing process, this

17

adversary inquiry, at the sentencing phase into new and

18

very stark relief.
QUESTION:

19

You think, Mr. Tigar, that the

20

Court's jurisprudence in capital cases, since 1987 has

defendant?

23

MR. TIGAR:

No, Justice -- Chief Justice

Chief Justice Rehnquist, in some

ways that jurisprudence has become more favorable to the

Delaware, the State has a freer play to put on aggravating

11

took full advantage of that here, putting in the

12

aggravating phase such things as the defendant had made a

vulgar gesture to a teacher by way of showing he'd be

14

dangerous in the future.

MR. TIGAR:

I think that notion of what was

Well, I would have thought your

answer to the Chief Justice would have been that to the
extent that the cases can be and must be read as saying

10

that a reasoned moral judgment must be applied by the

jury, that this is helpful to the defendant on the

mitigating side of the ledger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANA E. PARKER

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MS. PARKER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May

it please the Court:
Johnson, indeed, does not ask the Court to

12

overrule Jurek v. Texas.

13

it and let it die without further comment.

14

He instead asks the Court to gut

To accomplish this, Johnson proposes an

15

unprecedented rule, one that would require the State to

16

provide an independent life option, despite the fact that

17

proffered mitigating evidence maybe both considered and

QUESTION:

Mrs. Parker, may I ask you this

20

question?

in a very summary fashion I think is the argument in the

22

as-applied sense here, and I want you to tell me if I'm

23

wrong or if I'm -- or if there is a legal flaw in it.

24
25

And it - - what I'm going to put to you is what,

As I understand the argument on the other side,
it is if you start with the assumption that you're going

1

to keep Lockett and Eddings and Saffle, secondly, if a

2

reasonable juror could have concluded in this case that

3

Johnson was at least mature enough to have satisfied the

4

deliberateness criterion, and likewise that he was still

5

young enough so that for some period in the future - - I

6

don't know --a couple of years, 3, 4, 5 years -- the kind

7

of youthful lack of judgment could continue to be a

8

dangerous factor, then on those three premises, in effect,
the jury would be in a bind, given the instructions they

10

got, because there would, on the one hand, be an

11

obligation to give mitigating effect to relevant

12

mitigating evidence, but that on the facts of the case,

13

there would have been no way to do it because the so-

14

called mitigating evidence could not have been considered

15

in any way favorable to the defendant under deliberateness

16

and could only have been considered as a - - as an

17

aggravating factor on the question of future

18

dangerousness.

1

And I think his argument simply is that in this

20

case, this kind of case -- this is an example of it --

21

there's no way that the so-called mitigating evidence of

22

youthful impetuousness or bad judgment could have been

23

considered for a mitigating purpose and could have been

24

given the so-called reasoned moral treatment for that

25

purpose.

reasons.

And

What a juror reasonably could be

you're right on that point.
MS. PARKER:

Yes, Your Honor.

What the jury was

reasonably likely to do, how the jury was reasonably

13

likely to interpret its instructions.

to whether the jury was precluded as a matter of law from

QUESTION:

That inquiry goes

That is not

Well, isn't it -- isn't the proper

18

way to apply it that if the jury was reasonably likely to

19

view the evidence in the way that I think Mr. Tigar is

20

suggesting, i.e., as certainly in no way contrary to the

21

deliberateness of the act, and as also indicating under

22

the second issue a continuing youthfulness for some period

23

of time, which imports danger with it, if those two

24

conclusions were reasonably likely, then there's no way

25

they could consider it for a mitigating purpose.

MS. PARKER:

I think

3

that that is inconsistent with how this Court has

evidence does possess mitigating relevance to the second

issue, and where jurors --

QUESTION:

Well, how -- in other words, why is

he wrong when he assumes that a reasonable juror would
view it as aggravating rather than mitigating?
MS. PARKER:

I think there are -- that premise

12

is legally incorrect for two reasons, the first being that

13

it is not consistent with what the Court of Criminal

14

Appeals said in Zimmerman.

15

Criminal Appeals -- this is an as yet unpublished opinion,

16

Your Honor, but on the very same page that is cited in the

17

reply brief at page 12, the Court of Criminal Appeals

18

stated that youth can be seen as mitigating because

19

maturity often coincides with age.

20

merciful toward a young defendant in the belief the

21

defendant could live a productive life after an extended

22

period of incarceration.

QUESTION:

In Zimmerman, the Court of

But

have treated it as, in fact, aggravating, and if the

2

reasonable jury did treat it as aggravating, which is

3

possible I assume on this record, then it could not have

given any mitigating effect?

5

simply should have had that option.

6

MS. PARKER:

And his argument is they

No, Your Honor.

The jury could

7

still give the mitigating effect to that evidence.

8

precisely to the extent that youth may reflect a reduced

9

culpability in the sense that he is immature or impulsive,

10

that that evidence equally indicates that he will not pose

11

a future danger.

12

QUESTION:

It is

What does future dangerousness mean?

13

Does it mean whether he is going to be dangerous tomorrow,

14

or does it mean whether he is going to be dangerousness -

15

-danger after he has been released from a period of

16

incarceration?

17

Do we know that?

MS. PARKER:

The Court of Criminal Appeals has

18

stated that it's whether the defendant would continue to

19

commit criminal acts of violence so as to constitute a

20

continuing threat whether in or out of prison.

QUESTION:

today and going into the future he would continue to be

youthfulness as an aggravating factor.

That is precisely correct, Mr.

Chief Justice, and that is particularly true in a case

9

a mitigating aspect of youth and that that defendant,

10

precisely to that extent, is likely not to pose a future

danger.

13

That is what the Court of Criminal Appeals

And certainly nothing in the Constitution

requires that the jury view evidence only as a mitigating

this in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance

of counsel in Berger v. Kemp.

MS. PARKER:

They are in this case.

The Court

8

recognized this in Adams v. Texas.

The plurality

9

recognized this in Franklin v. Lynaugh, and even the

10

dissenting Justices in Blystone recognized that in

11

answering the special issues, because they are the

ultimate sentencing issues, that the jury, in fact, does

make a moral judgment about this defendant and about his

QUESTION:

Yes, but in Blystone the jury weighed

the aggravating and the mitigating factors.
MS. PARKER:

Yes, Your Honor, but a finding that

18

aggravation outweighs mitigation is no more or no less

19

utilitarian than an answer to these special issues.

20

jury in Pennsylvania, for example, would not be free to

21

return a sentence less than death if it honestly believed

22

that the aggravation outweighed the mitigation, but

23

nonetheless, a jury in Pennsylvania is not required to

24

have an independent life option independent of its

25

weighing of the evidence according to the State statute.

wide range of evidence, both aggravating and mitigating,

4

is relevant to the issues, and because they must be proven

beyond a reasonable doubt, the State certainly does not

require that the jury give much weight to the evidence

before it can answer a special issue no.
Unlike the typical enumerated aggravating and

mitigating factors that are used in pure balancing States,

10

Texas does not require the jury to find the existence of

11

preliminary facts before it can then proceed to weigh

12

those factors in deciding the ultimate issues.

13

catchall in Blystone, for example, is merely a vehicle by

which evidence can make its way into the actual weighing

QUESTION:

2

Would it be error for the judge not

answers question 2, it's making a finding of fact?
MS. PARKER:

5

No, Your Honor, it would not be.

6

Despite the factual nature of that inquiry, there is a

7

moral quality that is inherent in the ultimate issues of

any capital sentencing scheme here.
QUESTION:

9

But isn't it a utilitarian, moral

10

response?

In other words, isn't it a moral judgment by

11

the jury about what ought to be done rather than a moral

12

conclusion by the jury about the moral character of the

defendant or his act?

MS. PARKER:

No, Your Honor.

It is no more
