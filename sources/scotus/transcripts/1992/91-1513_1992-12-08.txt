ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. LONG, JR.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. LONG:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
For more than 200 years, Congress has determined

12

the priority of Federal claims against insolvent debtors.

13

The Federal priority statute, section 3713 of title 31,

14

provides that claims of the United States in nonbankruptcy

15

proceedings shall be paid first.

16

repeatedly held that only the plainest inconsistency would

17

warrant our finding an implied exception to the operation

18

of so clear a command.

19

This Court has

The question in this case is whether the

20

McCarran-Ferguson Act created an exception to the clear

21

command of section 3713.

22

argument has three basic points.

23

In our view, it did not, and our

24

business of insurance.

ordinary meaning of those words.

It does not result in the transfer or
It is not an integral part of the

10

contractual relationship between insurer and insured, and

11

it involves entities wholly outside the insurance

industry.

13

QUESTION:

Well, may I ask, Mr. Long why the

14

statute doesn't perhaps meet the National Securities test

15

since it is aimed at protecting directly or indirectly the

16

relationship between the insurer and the insured to the

17

extent that it covers the payout in the event of

18

insolvency.

MR. LONG:

to that question.

but insofar as it protects the insured.

1

Securities is a three-part test.

It's considerably

2

narrower than simply whether the State regulation has some

3

effect on the risk that the policyholder will not be paid.

4

We think that test would be too broad if it were simply

5

reduced back to that single factor.
The other part of the answer is, in fact, the

priority statute has relatively little to do with whether

8

a policyholder's claim is paid.

isn't it?

If it does happen, though, the

It might be a real concern.
MR. LONG:

15

It may be more likely these days, and

16

if it is a real concern of a policyholder, the real

17

insurance against insolvency is not the priority statute,

18

it is insurance guaranty funds, which have been

19

established by all 50 States to pay claims of

20

policyholders in the event the insurance company becomes

21

insolvent.
QUESTION:

22

Well, that may be, but I still think

23

to the extent that the statute tries to deal with this

24

situation, that it may very well be covered by McCarran-

25

Ferguson.

insurance company when it goes bust?
MR. LONG:

2

Well, as I say, in our view because

3

it's not a regulation of the business activities of the

4

insurers, it should not be held to be a regulation of the

5

business of insurance, and we don't think it meets the

6

three-part test that this Court has identified, which is

7

considerably more discriminating than simply a question of

8

whether this statute may lead to the payment of a

9

policyholder's claim.
And even to the extent you focus on that single

10
11

factor, we think that the priority statute is really not

12

very good protection in most cases.

13

policyholder, when he enters into a policy of insurance,

14

is likely to think about as an important protection.

1

And it seems to me that when a

policyholder, especially a major policyholder, looks at an

insurance company, he looks at the strength of its assets.

MR. LONG:

QUESTION:

I think that's the most -- one of the

6

most critical determinants in your choice of insurance

7

companies, and your -- you say that it's irrelevant the

moment the insurance company goes out of business.
MR. LONG:

9

Well, of course, this statute applies

if the State's regulations that are designed to protect

11

the solvency of insurance companies fail and the insurance

12

company is not solvent, but then the protection is the

15

That's what insures that the claim is

Let me discuss the three factors that this Court

16

has identified as relevant to determining whether a

17

statute regulates the business of insurance because the

18

test is broader than simply whether the statute was

19

enacted to protect policyholders or whether it may affect

20

the likelihood of a claim being paid.

21

In the Variable Annuity Life Insurance case, the

22

Court concluded that the concept of insurance must involve

23

some investment risk taking on the part of the company.

25

In the National Securities case, the Court held
that the Federal securities laws applied to a merger of

1

insurance companies that had been approved by State

2

insurance regulators.

3

did not make the States supreme in regulating all the

4

activities of insurance companies and that State laws

5

aimed at protecting the interests of shareholders are not

6

laws regulating the business of insurance.

7

It concluded that the McCarran Act

Then in the Royal Drug case, the Court held that

8

agreements between an insurer and pharmacies to supply

9

prescription drugs to policyholders were not part of the

10

business of insurance.

11

And most recently in Union Labor Life Insurance

12

against Pireno, the Court held that an insurer's use of a

13

peer review committee to determine whether policyholder

14

claims are covered by the insurance contract is also not

15

the business of insurance.
So, the Court has developed a three-factor test

17

-- and it's a rather demanding test -- to define the

18

boundaries of the business of insurance.

19

must have the effect of transferring or spreading risk

20

from the policyholder to the insurance company.

21

be an integral part of the policy relationship, and it

22

must be limited to entities in the insurance industry.

23

And the Ohio priority statute fails that demanding three-

24

part test.

whether it's an integral part of the relationship between

the policyholder and the insurance company.

fails that part and clearly fails the other two parts as

I can briefly explain our reasoning.
We think it clearly does not involve any

It just determines the order in which the -QUESTION:

differently, the United States could not have reached the

4

MR. LONG:

That's absolutely right.

That was

the principal issue in Knott, but the first part of the

holding was that the Federal priority statute applied to

these claims as long as they were assets of the insolvent

11

little different program where they make sure these assets

12

are kept in trust and therefore avoid your priority claim.

MR. LONG:

That is -- the Federal priority

necessarily a senseless distinction if you recognize that

8

the States their traditional authority to tax and regulate

the business of insurance.

It held that the

14

15

States had no authority to overrule the Federal priority

17

And, of course, this Court had held in

And it's not surprising that the Court reached

that result in Knott and reached it unanimously because

19

prior to South-Eastern Underwriters and prior to the

20

McCarran Act, even under the narrow view of the Commerce

21

Clause that prevailed as to insurance companies at that

22

time, it was clear that Congress had the power to enact a

1

conclude that in enacting the McCarran Act, Congress

2

intended to expand the regulatory authority of the States

3

beyond the authority that they had traditionally exercised

4

and to leave the determination of the priority of claims

5

of the United States entirely to the States, which

6

predictably would result in the kind of priority statute

7

that we have here where the claims of the United States

8

are not only subordinated to claims of policyholders, but

9

also to claims of general creditors, which of course can't

10

possibly be justified on the basis of protecting

11

policyholders.

12

So, to summarize our argument, we think the Ohio

13

priority statute falls outside the ordinary meaning of the

14

business of insurance because it does not regulate any

15

business activity of insurers.

16

satisfy this Court's three-part test for defining the

17

business of insurance, which is a narrow and demanding

18

test, and finally, it was clearly not part of the States'

19

traditional authority, prior to South-Eastern Underwriters

20

and the McCarran Act, to regulate the priority of claims

21

of the United States.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. RISHEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There's one point that I want to make clear at

6

7

the outset before going to the core legal question in this

8

case, and that is even after an insurance company is found

9

to be insolvent, it still functions as an insurance

10

company with respect to the claims of its policyholders

11

that arose before a finding of insolvency.

12

contractual relationship with these policyholders is

13

unchanged.

14

with these policyholders remains and is still being

15

developed, and the company's obligation to pay these

16

claims of these policyholders is unsatisfied, unrelieved.

That would lead to the conclusion I

suppose that the trustee in bankruptcy of a -- an

insolvent insurance company is subject to entirely State

Right?

22

MR. RISHEL:

23

Largely that's true.
Does that mean the Federal bankruptcy

It's not how Ohio has regulated the payment

We have regulated.

MR. RISHEL:

No.

I don't think you need to look

I think you have to look at it as a

policyholders to effectuate the payment of claims.

It undergirds that relationship at a time when the

2

policyholder is truly in a situation where they may not

9

that doesn't matter.

The best evidence of the fact that guaranty

As to the Knott decision, I thought that the

1

2

Solicitor General did an excellent job of distinguishing

3

that case from this case in his reply brief.

4

his footnote number 9, I believe, the last sentence at the

5

bottom of the page says Federal -- Knott, and he gives the

6

citation.

7

8

think that's a very succinct holding of this Court's

9

decision in Knott.

10

On page 14,

I

And then I'd ask you to look at appendix page A3

11

in our brief, section 3903.18 of the Ohio Revised Code,

12

another section of our insurance liquidation act, which

13

says the liquidator shall be vested by operation of law

15

rights of action and all of the books and records of the

18

So, what didn't happen in Knott happened here,

to acknowledge that if the property was not part of the

Now you're arguing that it was not part of the estate.

MR. RISHEL:

About Knott?

What I didn't have in the court of appeals was

In conclusion, the court of appeals correctly
found that the Ohio statute is part and parcel of the

10

large, complex, specialized administrative system adopted

11

by the State of Ohio to regulate the life of a domestic

12

insurance company from inception to dissolution pursuant

13

to the authority granted the State by McCarran-Ferguson.

14

The Government would transform that complex,

15

specialized administrative system into a claims collection

16

process for the primary benefit of the Federal Government.

17

To allow the Federal Government to assert a priority under

18

the Federal Claims Priority Act would allow for the very

19

Federal statutory interference with State regulation which

20

Congress eliminated in McCarran-Ferguson.

21

Under a correct application of the McCarran-

22

Ferguson Act and the phrase business of insurance, as

23

defined by this Court, we believe that the Federal

24

Government's claim against the American Druggists'

Federal bankruptcy code, they also amended this Federal

2

priority statute that we have here before us today.

3

amendment said that the Federal priority statute shall not

4

apply in proceedings under the Federal bankruptcy code

5

because of the different priorities Congress established.

6

But Congress left in effect the Federal priority statute,

7

the first priority as to nonbankruptcy proceedings, and

8

there was no indication that it intended to change the

9

rule that the Federal priority statute applies in

10

insurance company insolvency proceedings, just as it

11

applies in other types of State receiverships and in

12

proceedings against insolvent estates of decedents.

What is the provision that renders

the bankruptcy act inapplicable?

MR. LONG:

I think the

17

distinction suggested this morning, which is a new

18

suggestion, was not argued below, doesn't work anyway.

19

The Federal priority statute has been applied many times

20

over the years when a receiver has been appointed or a

21

liquidator to take over the assets of an insolvent debtor.

22

That's one of the classic acts of bankruptcy.

of the main situations in which the statute is triggered,

24

and it's -- the Court has never held that that works -- it

moves the assets away from the debtor.

They're just in the debtor's estate.

QUESTION:

your statement about practice?

7

MR. LONG:

I think there were not a great number

8

of insolvencies, and the United States often didn't file

9

claims in the past.

And also, this practice of the States

10

of prioritizing claims and placing the United States

rather low seems to have begun only in the late '60's in

12

Wisconsin.

13

15

company and may not have any tax claims.

It's a fairly recent development.

definition.

21

Court's prior decisions, and in particular, that would be

22

inconsistent with the antitrust -- the application of the

23

antitrust laws to the business of insurance, which is also

24

at issue here and is also an interest of the Federal

25

Government.

We think that is too broad a

We think that is inconsistent with this

SUITE 400

So, we urge the Court not to reject its prior

1

2

decisions and adopt that much broader test.

I mean, it

3

really is true that in a general sense every State law

4

regulating insurance companies is aimed at protecting

5

policyholders.
And finally, very briefly, on the third factor,

6

7

there was a argument that something that's not unique to

8

the insurance industry shouldn't be covered by this

9

factor.

In fact, the purpose of that factor, this Court

10

has said, is to recognize the importance of intra-industry

11

competition.

12

important in the insurance business that insurance

Congress thought that was particularly

3

companies needed to cooperate on rates and statistical

4

information and so forth.

5

So, we think that is actually a relevant

6

consideration, although again our principal submission

7

under that factor is that a lot of these claims involve

8

the ordinary business relationships of an insurance

9

company with suppliers of goods and services like the

20

relationship in Royal Drug with pharmacies that this Court

2

said was not a part of the business of insurance.
