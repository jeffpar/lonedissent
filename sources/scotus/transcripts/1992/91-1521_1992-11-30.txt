MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

trial for first degree murder, the jury must never know

15

that he voluntarily confessed to the crime after receiving

16

Miranda warnings and expressly waiving his rights because

17

5 months before confessing, he invoked his right to

18

counsel when he was arrested on an unrelated drug charge,

19

a charge he resolved with a guilty plea 3 months before

20

being questioned about the murder.

21

court of appeals should be reversed.

That court held that in respondent's

2 months later, he pled guilty

3 months after that, he was -- while still in

custody, he was arrested for murder, a charge unrelated to

the drug offense.

and this time he chose to waive them, giving the police a

7

videotaped statement in which he confessed to his role in

the murder.

He was again read his Miranda rights,

confession, even though they found it voluntary and found

respondent's waiver knowing and intelligent.

this result compelled by this Court's decision in Edwards

against Arizona and the rule that once a suspect invokes

submission this morning is that the guilty plea is a

2

dramatic change in circumstances that justifies lifting

3

the presumption.

4

consider whether the Edwards presumption continues in the

5

face of a guilty verdict, let alone a guilty plea.

6

Edwards, in Roberson, and in Minnick, the subject was in

7

the same position when he invoked his right to counsel as

8

when the police reinitiated questioning, a pretrial

suspect.

MR. ROBERTS:

1

Well, he didn't even have to say

2

that, of course, with respect to the drug charge.

3

Sixth Amendment would prevent the police from

4

interrogating the respondent on the drug charge and using

5

that at sentencing.

So, that's not an issue.

The only question would be then whether there's

The

a - - an invocation of the Fifth Amendment right.

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. ROBERTS:

And there it seems to us that the

10

invocation is respected, as it was here.

The police

11

immediately stopped the proceedings, but when there has

12

been a change in circumstances like the entry of a guilty

13

plea, that there is no reason to presume that the

14

suspect's wishes continue.
Now, we're not saying that the police have free

15
16

rein to question him, and they should presume now that

17

he's willing to talk to the police without his attorney,

18

just that the situation has changed sufficiently that

19

it's

20

QUESTION:

Well, it's strange.

Isn't it strange

21

that he invoked his right to counsel on a drug charge and

22

-- but with a much more serious charge, he didn't invoke

23

his right to counsel?

QUESTION:

Because he is still represented by

MR. ROBERTS:

The issue here is

the Fifth Amendment right to counsel and whether or not

the Edwards presumption should continue in effect after a

guilty plea.

QUESTION:

1

But what is the dramatic change other

2

than the fact that if you win this case, there will be a

3

dramatic change?

4

before and after the guilty plea?

But what else is dramatically different

5

MR. ROBERTS:

6

QUESTION:

The investigative process --

In terms of rights to talk to people

7

and rights to have access to counsel, what's the

8

difference?
MR. ROBERTS:

9

The difference is that the

10

investigative process on the drug charge, which is of

11

course what Miranda was centrally concerned about, is

12

over.
QUESTION:

13
14

No, it isn't because he hadn't been

sentenced yet.
MR. ROBERTS:

15

The police are unlikely to

continue an investigation on sentencing, and if they do,

18

No, but aren't matters relevant to

the drug charge, even though he has pleaded guilty, still

relevant to the sentencing decision that is yet to be

made?

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS:

It is reasonable to assume that

that dramatic change in circumstances might alter his

judgment about whether to talk to the police without a

lawyer.

9

QUESTION:

It seems to me that argument would

justify questioning about the drug charge as well.
MR. ROBERTS:

No, it would not because the Sixth

Amendment protects him there.

He has the right to counsel

20

in any custodial interrogation with respect to the drug

21

charge, but as the court explained in McNeil, that doesn't

22

apply to the murder charge.

QUESTION:

to be questioned about the murder charge and confessed it,

that could be used because of the Sixth Amendment right.
QUESTION:

6

It would then

I mean, I'm wondering whether the

7

cutoff time might not be the sentencing on the drug charge

8

rather than the entry of the plea, because it isn't clear

9

to me how the information you would learn on questioning

10

him after the plea and before sentencing wouldn't somehow

11

be used at the sentencing on the drug charge.
MR. ROBERTS:

12

Well, it's not how guilty pleas

13

have been treated elsewhere, for example, in the Federal

14

Rules of Evidence.

15

an appeal, for example, may still be used for impeachment

16

purposes.

17

specifically addressed in the Federal Rules, that if

plea may be used for impeachment purposes.

QUESTION:

Do you agree that there should be

You'd have us apply a totality of the

I don't think it goes that far.

yet, we think they have to look to see to make sure he has

It has to look to

16

All we are suggesting is that there are

17

additional relevant factors to consider, factors that look

18

to the same concerns that the ones the Court already

19

considers to look to, to determine if there's a reasonable

end to the Edwards presumption.

bright line, but beyond that --

The guilty verdict is significant because it is

1

2

addressed to the same concerns that trigger Miranda.

3

Miranda is concerned about the investigative process.

4

That's at an end when the defendant has been found guilty.

5

QUESTION:

Well, but after a guilty plea and

6

before sentencing, the defendant may feel very real

7

pressure to cooperate with the police in order to obtain

8

lenient treatment on his sentencing.

9

MR. ROBERTS:
QUESTION:

10

And if he's --

And it seems to me that's -- if we're

11

going to draw this line, sentencing is a much more

12

sensible place to draw it if this is how we're going to do

13

it.

14

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, I don't think so, Your

15

Honor, because sentencing isn't directed to the concern of

16

Miranda, which is investigation.

17

right to counsel presumably because he's afraid that

18

without counsel he'll say something incriminating and be

pressures in custodial interrogation.

1

Amendment, as I indicated, protects if the police are

2

questioning him for information to use at sentencing.

3

With a probation officer or something like that, there's

4

certainly a split as to whether the Sixth Amendment

5

applies, but even if it doesn't, that is in our position

6

not custodial interrogation.

7

wouldn't apply in any event.
But with respect to the need for a bright line,

8

9

And so, Miranda and Edwards

our position is that, first of all, the guilty plea is a

10

bright line, but a line needs more than brightness to

11

commend it when it has the consequence of excluding a

12

voluntary, warned confession in the circumstances of this

13

case.

14

QUESTION:

May I just be sure I understand your

15

position, Mr. Roberts?

17

say we don't want to ask you about the specific crime to

about everything else in your life that might have a

20

bearing on your sentencing.

officer does, not the prosecutor's office.

MR. ROBERTS:

QUESTION:

MR. ROBERTS:

Assuming there's no Sixth

But the brightness of the line in our view

12

cannot be the only consideration.

You need to look, as

MR. ROBERTS:

position there was that the approach on a different

8

Edwards was based upon.

The purpose not -- is here not to prevent police

It's to protect the ease of administration,

been a sufficient passage of time to justify going back to

We also think that the combination of the

factors in Roberson and Minnick, having an opportunity to

consult with an attorney and the approach being on an

entirely unrelated offense, is also sufficient to lift the

those activities that occurred prior to the request for

Mr. Conte, is it the practice in the

can be present if he wants to?

MR. CONTE:

It's not.
There are judges I am aware of who

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. ROBERTS, JR.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. ROBERTS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

21

I think it's important to remember exactly what

22

it is that we're suggesting today.

It is not that when

23

there is a finding of guilt or, we think in particular, a

24

guilty plea, police may now presume that the suspect is

25

willing to talk to them without his attorney.

All we're saying is that the facts have changed

1

2

to such an extent that it is reasonable to once again

3

regard that question as an open question, and the first

4

thing that the suspect will be reminded of is that he has

5

a right not to talk to the police without his attorney.

6

If he still -- given the change in the situation, if he

7

still does not wish to talk to the police without an

8

attorney, all he has to do is say so.

9

time, and he knows it will work again.

It worked the last

In other words, the deck has been reshuffled, he

10
11

has been dealt a new hand, and there's no reason to

12

presume that his opening bid is going to be the same.

3

That's why we think it is the finding of guilt and the

4

guilty plea that is a sufficient change in circumstances

5

that justifies reopening the question once again.

6

With respect to the difference between the

7

guilty plea and sentencing, under the Sixth Amendment, he

8

cannot be interrogated for information to be used at

9

sentencing on the drug charge, and under -- because it is

20

not custodial interrogation, questioning by a court

21

official -- that's why the warnings are not given -- the

22

Edwards presumption doesn't apply in the first place.

23

That's why we think it is the guilty plea, the guilty

24

verdict, rather than sentencing that is a determining

25

factor.

whether or not the Sixth Amendment right applies at the

probation officer interview.

then they can't be used at sentencing.

QUESTION:

Is counsel correct that the probation

14

officer does not routinely give Miranda warnings when

15

other crimes are to be discussed?

16

MR. ROBERTS:

That's my understanding, yes, that

a probation officer does not give Miranda warnings and, we

submit, is not required to because that's not custodial
