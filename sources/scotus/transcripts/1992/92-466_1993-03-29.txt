ORAL ARGUMENT OF PHILLIP AREEDA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. AREEDA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The jury in this case found predatory price

12

discrimination by respondent Brown & Williamson, in

13

violation of the Robinson-Patman Act.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

And --

That predatory price violation was

discrimination among its wholesalers.
MR. AREEDA:

Yes, Your Honor.

The form of

17

the -- the form of the discrimination was in rebates to

18

wholesalers designed not to be passed on to consumers.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. AREEDA:

Brown & Williamson wholesalers.
Brown & Williamson wholesalers.

21

fact, the wholesalers were not brand specific, but to

22

wholesalers with whom it -- to whom it sold, yes.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And how -- did it find how that hurt

those -- that discrimination hurt your clients?
MR. AREEDA:

In

Yes, Your Honor.

The -- this

1

discrimination resulted in net prices to B&W that were

2

below its average variable cost.

3

average variable cost, these rebates, had to be met by

4

Liggett in order to retain the patronage of the

5

wholesalers on whom it depended.
QUESTION:

6

7

These prices below

So you had wholesalers doing business

both with Brown & Williamson and with Liggett.

8

MR. AREEDA:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
But as I understand the instructions,

10

the jury could have found in your favor even if it made no

11

finding that the sales were below average variable cost.
MR. AREEDA:

12

13

No, Your Honor, I think the

instructions --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. AREEDA:

Or is that the argument in this case?
That's the argument of the other

16

side.

17

to find that B&W engaged in below-cost pricing with a

18

reasonable prospect of recoupment before it could find

19

that there was the injury to competition that it did find.

20

The instructions, fairly read, did require the jury

Furthermore, B -- the B&W experts in court

21

admitted that the pricing was below average variable cost.

22

To be sure, they sought to draw the string from that

23

admission by introducing alleged tax savings, but there's

24

no evidence -- the brief of the other side cites no

25

evidence at all of any realized tax savings. So - 4

QUESTION:

1

And is it your theory of the case

2

that this is part of your burden, to show that it was

3

below average variable cost?
MR. AREEDA:

4

Yes, Your Honor, we do.

We accept

5

the burden of showing that prices were discriminatory,

6

below average variable cost, and were undertaken with a

7

reasonable prospect of recoupment.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

I don't understand.

Discriminatory,

in what respect were they discriminatory here?

As between

different wholesalers, right?
MR. AREEDA:

11

A scheme -- the rebates were based

12

on volume.

And a volume rebate, for example 75, 80 cents

13

a carton, for wholesalers who handle 1,500 cases during

14

some period.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. AREEDA:

17

QUESTION:

19

MR. AREEDA:

21

And lesser rebates to other -- to

wholesalers who did not handle that volume.

18

20

Right.

Right, right.
Now, these are discriminatory

volume rebates.
QUESTION:

I can understand how that

22

discrimination would hurt a small wholesaler, one that

23

does not buy in high volume.

24

discrimination is a form of discrimination that -- that in

25

any way focuses in upon your client.

I do not see how that

MR. AREEDA:

1

The discrimination triggers the

2

statute.

The statute only applies in the case of price

3

discrimination.

4

discrimination, and therefore the statute is triggered.

5

Now, what is the connection between such discrimination

6

and my client?

7

cheaper.

Such discrimination makes predation

That is, if you offer your below-cost prices to

8

9

The -- there is admitted price

some of your customers and you charge other customers

10

higher prices, though still below cost, the overall

11

burden, the financial burden on the predator, is

12

diminished, making predation -- thereby facilitating

3

predation.

4

of this kind,

5

well, that the discrimination facilitated the predation.

6

That is why the statute covers discrimination
And that is what the jury found here as

Well, I thought it covered

7

discrimination of this kind in order to protect the person

who's being discriminated against.

MR. AREEDA:

But -And I just don't see how your client

is being discriminated against by this discrimination.

line price discrimination.

The kind of price

2

discrimination which you have focused on, Justice Scalia,

3

is the secondary line price discrimination that has the

4

impact of harming the disfavored buyer, the disfavored

5

wholesaler.
Primary line price discrimination, that price

7

discrimination which has an impact on competitors in the

8

market, is what is at issue in this case.

9

discrimination never has an impact on competitors

Price

directly.

11

can facilitate predatory pricing, and that is what -- that

12

is what happened in this case.

13

It has an impact on competitors only because it

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you said in answer to

14

my question, Mr. Areeda, that it did have an effect on

15

your client because your client had to change its

16

procedures in order to continue to retain the business of

17

the wholesaler.

MR. AREEDA:

Exactly, exactly.

documents, would induce Liggett to raise its list prices,

The consequence of this --

QUESTION:

And so what exactly are the losses

MR. AREEDA:

When it has to match the

below-cost -- when it has to match the rebates the -- of

7

the defendant, of the respondent, which are below cost.

8

To match those below-cost rebates forces it to bear

9

losses.
QUESTION:

10

But is it because the -- is it

11

because Brown & Williamson discriminated among its

12

wholesalers that Liggett has to do that, or because Brown

13

Sc

Williams was selling below cost?

MR. AREEDA:

Both.

It's -- the sales below cost

Well, why it is - - I don't -- I still

22

don't see why the discrimination facilitates the scheme.

I mean what -- it would seem to me the scheme would be

even more effective if you didn't just offer these

even further to everybody, inflicting even more punishment

upon the person you're seeking to -- to predate, if -- if

3

that's a verb.

4

MR. AREEDA:

That -- that might be.

That might

5

be the consequence.

But the reason that it facilitates,

6

the reason it facilitates is that it makes the expenditure

7

on predation less.

8

Honor, that if all -- if prices were lowered uniformly,

9

the burden on the rival could be greater, which is what

Now, it's true -- it is true, Your

10

you -- which is what you've focused on.

11

time, it's also true that by not having to extend the

12

lowest prices to all of your customers, the predator

But at the same

expends less on his predatory program.

QUESTION:

Is this the difference between a

Sherman Act section 2 claim and a Robinson-Patman Act

claim?

brought this suit as a section 2 Sherman Act claim?

And beyond that, I want to know could you have

MR. AREEDA:

The answer to your -- the answer to

your questions are respectively yes and no.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. AREEDA:

I'll explain.

To your two questions are yes and

22

no.

First, the difference between the two statutes is

23

that the Sherman Act does not require any price

24

discrimination.

25

statutes, which gives the answer to your second question,

A second difference between the two

is that the Sherman Act as conventionally required --

interpreted, requires single-firm monopoly.

contend that there's a single-firm monopoly in this -- in

this case.

5

What is in issue in this case --

QUESTION:

And we do not

May I ask you sort of a preliminary

7

question?

Was there anything in this case, or any

evidence in this case that there was any secondary-line

injury to competition?

10

MR. AREEDA:

12

the wholesalers were injured?

question, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Was -Was there proof, for example, that

That --no one has litigated that

There was never a suggestion that the

16

discrimination would be unlawful if that kind of injury to

17

competition ensued, and then the next question is was your

client damaged by the illegal discrimination.

didn't -- nobody argued the case in that way.

the case on that basis, but let me answer your -- let me

answer your question.

would not think a competitor of -- of the discriminator

1

In other words,

if a -- if a food

chain, for example, discriminated between a chain store

and an individual small, and by that means got a large

account away from a competing supplier, that would be --

It was derivative

That would not be the injury

to competition.

The injury to competition makes the

then the statutory violation might injure a -- but,

16

anyway,

that theory isn't even involved.

MR. AREEDA:

That's not -- that's not here.
Okay.
What is here is that the losses, as

B&W predicted,

prices,

the gap between regular brand - - the regular brand product

23

and the generic product.

MR. AREEDA:

accept that burden.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. AREEDA:

Yes, Your Honor.

We do -- we do

Uh-huh.
We do believe, and we have

6

proposed, in fact, as the --as the rule in this case in

7

our brief, that a reasonable prospect of recoupment should

8

be required as a means of -- as a means of reinforcing --

9

making the court feel more comfortable that predation is

10

11
12

actually taking place.
QUESTION:

So to that extent Utah Pie is not to

the contrary or it is limited somehow?

13

MR. AREEDA:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. AREEDA:

Utah Pie did not reach that issue.
Uh-hum.
Utah Pie came early in the thinking

16

about predatory pricing and did not reach the issue as to

17

whether recoupment would be required.

18

QUESTION:

Well, tell me what differences you

19

have with the respondent's legal theory in this case.

20

Does it boil down to a question of fact for us, or is

21

there a difference in legal theory between you and the

22

respondent?

23

MR. AREEDA:

The respondent suggests that he

24

agrees with our position, that -- that predation oligopoly

25

is possible, but all of the arguments in the respondent's

brief are that is it impossible.

And the lower court, the

2

Fourth Circuit, upset the jury verdict not on the basis of

3

reviewing the facts of the case, but on the grounds that a

4

mere 12 percent firm --a mere oligopolist could not

5

believe that recoupment was economically rational.
And I'd like -- what I'd like to put before you is

6

7

that recoupment is economically rational in the

8

circumstances of -- of this case.

9

recoupment and success in predation are really the same

Recoupment -- that is

10

thing.

Success is what hurts the consumers.

11

brings about the payoff to the predator.

Success also

Now, recoupment and success is possible whenever

12

13

predation can bring about or achieve supracompetitive

14

prices.

15

prices are supracompetitive.

16

supracompetitive prices on regular-brand product was, in

fact, the object of the predatory scheme.

In this market it's quite well established that

that prices were fair and yes, we're not engaged in

In this

That does not at all negate the textbook - - the

fact that this industry is the textbook example of

8

supracompetitive prices.

9

sides, such as the Scherer book, say so.

And the textbooks cited by both
It is the

classic example of supracompetitive prices and it was the

purposes -- it was the purpose and effect of defendant's

conduct to protect those supracompetitive prices by

And the result of what it did, the result of

15

what defendant did, was not only was the gap narrowed, but

QUESTION:

Prices --

On your theory, Mr. Areeda, does it

MR. AREEDA:

3

Which it did, here, didn't it?
Yes.

Yes, it's an undisputed fact

that the volume of generics grew.

QUESTION:

So you -- you can -- you don't

5

achieve anything by a bit of a narrowing if the volume of

6

the --of the generics increases.

7

MR. AREEDA:

8

could raise the average price.

on what the volume increase is

MR. AREEDA:

12

QUESTION:

13

Yes.
--As compared to the price

differential, I suppose.

14

MR. AREEDA:

Yes, it does.

And if you take

15

the - - you take the prices that appear in the record and

16

you take the volume numbers that appear in the record and

17

weigh the prices by the volume over the period, you find

that the average price rose from something under $26 in

this - - in the - - at the beginning of the period to

20

something over $40 -- that's per thousand.

QUESTION:

22

MR. AREEDA:

--At the -- at the end of this

period.

So the average price is rising considerably.

Volume greater but average price higher, consumers

therefore hurt.

QUESTION:

Mr. Areeda, one of the -- one of the

2

things that the predator in this situation had to

3

anticipate was not only the ability to recoup later, but

4

also that the other oligopolists would not -- would not

MR. AREEDA:

All right.
B&W itself predicted that its

16

fellow oligopolists would be likely to enter the discount

17

segment of the business, the generic sector of the market.

B&W predicted that in advance of the repositioning of

Doral, if you -- if one has that in mind, and afterwards.

20

It predicted that others would enter the market, but that

21

the others shared B&W's interest in narrowing that gap.

22

Now, this isn't clairvoyance on B&W's part.

23

It's a recognition of the objective facts of the market.

The objective fact of the market is that everybody in this

narrow the gap to manage prices and profitability upwards.

8

And that is exactly what happened, Your Honor.

And

The fact that the generic segment grew in size

is, I suggest, more a response to the explosion in prices

Right.
And it did not feel obliged to

did not feel obliged to raise its own rebates.

2

And, indeed, that final proposal is a crucial document

3

here, and I think they were quite correct to rely upon it.

4

But I wanted to meet first the assertion that

5

there is a jury verdict here which must be respected.

6

facts here are such that even if the jury had answered

would be no facts to back up such a verdict.
But in fact, as we've said in our brief and I

12

won't dwell upon it at length, these instructions the

13

judge gave clearly permit the jury to find liability

14

solely on the basis of the intent of bad intent,

15

generalized bad intent in Brown & Williamson documents.

16

And, indeed, that's what Liggett argued to the judge, that

17

bad intent plus injury to Liggett was enough.

18

And he instructed -- if you look at instructions

No, but I'm -- the point I'm making

here, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, is not that we should

be entitled to a new trial.

4

you can infer nothing from the jury verdict because of the

route to find B&W liable, and that route was simply

7

aggressive or bad statements in pre-Doral documents.

8

instructions 16, 18, and 29 clearly offer the jury that

9

choice.

The point I'm making here is

That is the jury was given an impermissible

And

And moreover, when the jury, on the eighth day

10

11

of its deliberations, said the written instructions it had

12

before were kind of confusing and it needed help on the

13

question of competitive injury, the judge gave an

14

off-the-cuff oral statement in which he stressed bad

15

intent and a generic submarket, which, of course, he later

16

said shouldn't have been in the case.

me almost probable that the jury found B&W guilty for some

18

aggressive statements in its documents.

So that it seems to

We had a - - we requested instruction that we had

agreed, but didn't give -- and the jury could have found,

22

if you look at those instructions, that B&W is liable on

without finding any oligopolistic coordination, without

finding any below cost pricing, without finding any

has just -- I think that violates this court's ruling in

of section 2(a) does not make it merely redundant under

said that using price discrimination facilitates predation

Also unlike Matsushita, this is not a summary-

The district court here let this case go

to trial, heard all of the evidence, reread it for 5

months, and then wrote a very thoughtful j.n.o.v. opinion.

So that I think primarily both courts below rested upon

For example, Liggett says we were going to save

Now, the proposal also states that given RJR's

Justice.

The only evidence in this case are the

For example, we've touched upon this before,

was no tacit collusion, no supracompetitive prices and

that what you're saying to us is that the management

The court noted that they tried to sell a lot of

5

cigarettes to replace Philip Morris as number one.

6

Furthermore, the court said there is no evidence that any

7

of the other major cigarette companies had an interest in

slowing the growth of generics.

9

companies sold generics, today all six do.

Then five of the six
We started

10

with 2.8 billion cigarettes being sold in generics, that

11

jumped to 80 billion, and today it's about twice that.

12

there's been no slowing of the growth of generics, but

13

rather quite the contrary.

So

This is a lawsuit by one full-line competitor

against another full-line competitor, both of whom were

think the only inference one can draw, after looking at

the facts and seeing that there was no plan to do what
