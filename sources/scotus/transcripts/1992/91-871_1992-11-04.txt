ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN M. GILLIS

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. GILLIS:

12

13
14

The court remains in session.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case involves the question of

15

interpretation of the Longshore and Harbor Workers

16

Compensation Act as amended in 1984, as it applies to

17

claims by retired workers for occupational hearing loss.

18

The facts are quite simple.

Mr. Brown, the

19

plaintiff, worked for the employer, Bath Iron Works, in

20

Bath, Maine, from 1939 until his retirement in 1972.

21

1985, 13 years after his retirement, he filed a claim for

22

occupational hearing loss under the act.

23

based upon an audiogram taken in 1983, which showed an

24

84 percent hearing loss.

25

section 908(c) (13) by the administrative law judge.

That claim was

That award was made under

In

The issue as presented is whether certain

1

2

amendments to the act in 1984 applying to occupational

3

disease claims by retirees should have been applied to

4

determine this worker's claim, or this worker's benefit.

5

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit

6

below held that the occupational disease amendments in

7

1984 were not applicable to hearing loss claims and would

8

not affect this case.

9

Previously, the administrative law judge on the

10

Benefits Review Board of the Department of Labor had held

11

in this case that the occupational disease law amendments

12

would apply for the limited purpose of determining the

13

average weekly wage for the purpose of calculating

14

benefits, but that they were otherwise not applicable to

15

hearing loss claims.
In other cases, the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits

16
17

have held that the occupational disease amendments in 1984

18

do apply to hearing loss claims and subsequently the

19

Department's Benefits Review Board earlier this year

20

reversed itself and has agreed with the Fifth and Eleventh

21

Circuits.

22

Our position is that the amendments do apply.
In order to analyze the problem, it is necessary

23

to review the statute as it existed prior to 1984 and the

24

case law under the pre-'84 statute.

25

amendments, the statute provided for two basic types of

disability benefits.
The one would be a nonscheduled award, or an

2

3

award for economic disability.

4

the worker is disabled by injury or disease from

5

performing his regular work.

6

benefits for total or partial benefits which could be

7

temporary or permanent.

He could have received

The second basic type of award is a so-called

That comes into play when

scheduled award, found in sections 908(c)(1) through (20).

10

That award compensates the worker for specific losses of

11

bodily parts or bodily functions or percentages of loss.

12

Among the types of scheduled award is a hearing loss under

13

section 908(c)(13).

14

Early in 1984, the Benefits Review Board issued

15

two decisions having to do with retirees claiming

manifest.

20

to a nonscheduled disability benefit because of his status

21

as a retiree, the reasoning being that because he had

22

retired he was out of the labor force and it was

23

inappropriate to provide him with a disability benefit.

24
25

The first was Aduddell v. Owens-

1

worker for benefits under section 908(c) (13), a scheduled

2

award for hearing loss, and following Aduddell, the board

3

held that the worker was not entitled to the award because

4

of his status as a retiree at the time the hearing loss

5

became manifest.

6

Against this background, Congress amended the

7

statute in 1984 in part dealing with the problem of

8

occupational disease claims by retirees, and our position

9

is that those amendments were intended to apply to hearing

10

11

loss claims just as to other occupational disease claims.
A starting point for analyzing the statute --

12

that is, the amendments -- is section 910(i), which I'll

13

refer shorthand as section 10(i).

14

essentially that in occupational disease claims the time

15

of injury for the purpose of determining the average

16

weekly wage is the time when the occupational disease

17

becomes manifest to the worker, when he becomes aware of

18

it, or should have become aware of it.

QUESTION:

Now, in this case, do you concede

22

that the hearing loss actually occurred during a time he

23

was employed actively?

MR. GILLIS:

I think it depends on which hearing

loss you're referring to.

2

whether it occurred - - whether it was present at the time

3

he retired, and that's because of the effect of aging, so

4

that the disability that became manifest to the worker in

5

1983 and for which he was entitled to claim in all

6

likelihood didn't occur at the time he retired.

That basic theory, but I just feel

21

it doesn't go far enough because it doesn't concentrate on

2

whether the hearing loss resulting from the occupational

3

conditions was manifest in a manner in which it could or

4

should have been perceived during the period of

5

employment, and that is conceded, isn't it?
MR. GILLIS:

6

The only issue that we have is

The hearing loss wasn't manifest

7

during the period of employment, the hearing loss wasn't

8

manifest -QUESTION:

9

Well, the fact that he had an

10

84 percent hearing loss at some later time presumably was

11

not manifest earlier, but that's not the issue that we're

12

dealing with.
MR. GILLIS:

5

We're dealing with the issue of

whether - QUESTION:

We don't even know whether he's

entitled to compensation or an 84 percent hearing loss.

7

That's not the issue in this case.

8
9

MR. GILLIS:

That's not the issue.

In fact, we

would concede that he is entitled to that, because there

20

was no offset under this statute for the effects of aging.

21

As we pointed out in our brief --

22

QUESTION:

You would concede that he is entitled

23

to compensation for 84 percent?

provision of the law -8

for you to make, but --

way.

whether the compensation should have been under section

What I mean to say is, he's an entitled to an award

QUESTION:

The question is

And whether it should or should not

be depends upon which the hearing loss -- depends upon

10

whether the hearing loss attributable to the occupational

11

conditions -- the injury attributable to the occupational

12

conditions occurred during the period of employment and

13

whether that loss was manifest or should have been

14

manifest during the period of employment.

15

correct, isn't it?

16

MR. GILLIS:

That is

I guess I would change that a

17

little to say that it depends on whether the disability

18

that became manifest to the worker became manifest before

19

or after the retirement.

20

QUESTION:

Well, except that that, as I

21

understand it, is not the standard.

The standard is not

22

whether it was manifest to him, the standard is whether it

23

was either known or should have been known, and I presume

24

that means that following exposure to conditions that

25

would naturally harm his hearing, he could have had an

audiogram and discovered his disability then.
He loses nothing by waiting, because we have the

2

3

savings clause now that the period for application is not

4

lost, but the fact is the point at which the injury is

5

measured doesn't depend on whether he perceived the loss

6

as a fact or not, isn't that correct?

7

MR. GILLIS:

I think that the provision under

8

which he's compensated does depend on when the hearing

becomes manifest in terms of when it's measured.

No, but I -- excuse me, I'm not

making my question clear.

13

Do you concede that whether or not -- excuse me.

14

Do you concede that the point at which the injury occurred

15

does not depend merely on whether he perceived it but on

16

whether he perceived or should have perceived it?

17

MR. GILLIS:

I think that the time when the

18

injury occurred, what we're referring to is the time of

19

injury under section 910(i), and I think that depends on

1

disability, which is an impairment measured by a hearing

2

test, until the hearing test is taken.

3

QUESTION:

But that's not how

0(i) reads.

It

4

reads, with respect to a claim for compensation for death

5

or disability due to an occupational disease which does

6

not immediately result in death or disability, and I

7

understand it to be conceded that the hearing loss here

8

immediately occurs when he's working and his ears are

9

invaded by excessive noise, that the injury immediately

10

11

results, therefore

0(i) is inapplicable.

MR. GILLIS:

I think that the question is what

12

disability is Congress referring to when they refer to,

3

does not immediately result in death or disability, and

4

our position is that the disability that's important is

5

the disability that becomes manifest in the disability

6

which the worker can claim.

7

occupational component of the hearing loss results

8

immediately or virtually immediately.

9

QUESTION:

It's true that the

But that's all the section talks

20

about -- disability due to an occupational disease which

21

does not immediately result in death or disability.

22

MR. GILLIS:

But I think that the first and the

23

third references to disability in the statute refer to

24

something else, and that the disability should be read

25

consistently.

That is, each reference to disability

QUESTION:

2

The --

I have a problem that's a slightly --

3

it's a threshold problem on this same section while you're

4

on it.

5

Scalia, but I have trouble seeing why is this an

6

occupational disease at all?

I don't mean to interrupt your answer to Justice

7

MR. GILLIS:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. GILLIS:

Well -Why isn't it an injury?
Because the distinction between an

10

injury and an occupational disease is that an injury

11

happens because of a sudden event, where an occupational

12

disease occurs over a long period of time, evolves over a

3

period of time, and occurs not because of an accident or a

4

sudden event, but because of the characteristics of the

5

particular industry.
QUESTION:

6

Are you saying that a hearing loss is

7

an occupational disease as opposed to an accidental

8

injury?

9
20
21

MR. GILLIS:

Yes.

There can be cases where a

sudden event can cause hearing loss, such as an explosion.
QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the act in 902 define

22

accidental injury and occupational disease as two

23

different things?

Then we could

1

pursue the question as to when it occurs.
MR. GILLIS:

2

Right.

The statute describes an

3

occupational disease as arises naturally out of such

4

employment.

5

In the case of, for example, a shipyard, the

6

disease naturally results from the condition of

7

employment, and we've cited in the briefs -QUESTION:

10

But there's still a difference

between an occupational disease on the one hand and an
injury on the other --

11

MR. GILLIS:

12

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And it seems to me that all that this

13

statute does is to talk about occupational injuries, so

14

that you're not within it anyway.
MR. GILLIS:

16

When you say this statute, you

QUESTION:

MR. GILLIS:

that hearing loss is an occupational disease by the

various circuit courts.

specifically.

MR. GILLIS:

QUESTION:

MR. GILLIS:

5

QUESTION:

Correct.
Do you think that your interpretation

of the statute is the only permissible one?

7
8

And by the way, your position is at

odds with the Director's position.

4

6

That's correct.

MR. GILLIS:

I think it's the only plausible

one, yes.

9

Moving from section 910 (i),

in the case where

10

the time of injury is after retirement, section 910(d)(2)

11

determines the average weekly wage, depending on whether

12

it is within a year or after a year of retirement.

13

In cases in which section 910(d)(2) applies,

section 908(c) (23), enacted in 1984,

that section must apply if section 910(d)(2) applies.

as being the time of injury rather than the date of last

4

QUESTION:

But then

0(i) becomes circular.

0(i) says with respect to a disability which does not

disability, an occupational disease, a disability due to

7

an occupational disease which does not immediately result,

8

the time of injury shall be deemed to be the date -- shall

9

be deemed to be the date on which the employee or claimant

10
11
12

becomes aware.
I mean, that's why you need that section.

You

wouldn't need that section if the natural order of things

3

is that the time that an injury occurs is the time that

4

you become aware of it.

5

that result for certain types of injuries.

6

MR. GILLIS:

It's only

But without

0(i) that produces

0(i), the time of

7

injury for average weekly wage purposes would be the date

8

of last exposure, and the legislative history makes it

9

clear that Congress did not want that result at all.

20

Congress wanted the time of injury to be the

21

date of manifestation, at which time we determine the

22

worker's wage, at which time his time for filing begins to

run, and in the case where the time is after retirement,

there are special provisions.

1

these provisions under Redick and Aduddell, the worker

2

whose time of injury was after retirement would have been

3

denied benefits all together.

4

QUESTION:

Let me put it -- it seems to me that

5

you're saying 10 (i) applies here because this is an injury

6

that occurred after retirement, and then I ask you why

7

this is an injury that recurs after retirement, and you

8

say, because 10 (i) says that it shall be deemed to be an

9

injury that recurs after retirement, but you don't get

10

into 10 (i)

No, but it -- 10(i) deals with

injury does not occur immediately -- that is, while you're

21

still working, okay -- and I ask you why this injury

22

didn't occur immediately, and you say, well, because 10(i)

says it shall be deemed not to have occurred until you

find out about it, but you don't get into 10 (i) unless it

did not occur immediately.

QUESTION:

Your time
If that

Yes.
Retirement, you're in 10(d)(2).
That is because asbestosis is not a

10

disease which immediately results in disability, but I

11

thought that it had been conceded here that the hearing

12

disability occurs immediately.
MR. GILLIS:

13

Again, we have to refine that to

14

mean -- to determine whether we're talking about a

15

disability that the worker can claim, and the disability

16

that later becomes manifest on the one hand, or just the

17

occupational component of the disease, which may not be

18

manifest to the worker.

19

I think the real question is did Congress intend

20

to make this distinction between long latency diseases and

21

other types of occupational diseases.

22

interesting distinction to draw, there's no evidence that

23

Congress was even aware of the distinction or intended to

24

make the distinction in excluding hearing loss from

MR. GILLIS:

11

The compensable hearing loss is the entire hearing loss,

which may have an aging component as well.

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

If the employer -- this is a

14

side question, but if the employer can establish that a

15

portion of the hearing loss is due solely to aging,

16

nothing to do with the employment, must the employer

17

compensate the employee for that age-related damage?

18

MR. GILLIS:

Yes.

Yes, and that's why I think

19

the distinction is important.

QUESTION:

Well, you don't deny, do you, that if

following the date of his first exposure to noise he said

I wonder if I had a hearing loss, and he went to -- what

is it, an audiologist, and had his hearing measured, and

the finding was that he had suffered a 5 percent hearing

MR. GILLIS:

That would be compensable, yes.

MR. GILLIS:

6

As I mentioned, the court -- the Congress was

I agree with that.

7

aware of Redick and had to do - - and wanted to do

8

something about it, and if section 910(i) does not apply

9

to hearing loss claims,

10

then there's nothing else in the

statute that would change the result of Redick.
QUESTION:

11

Well, except that there -- Redick

12

is -- or the desire to respond to Redick is satisfied

13

simply by extending the date within which claim may be

14

made,

15

isn't that true?
MR. GILLIS:

I don't believe so, because

16

Redick -- the claimant in Redick was not denied benefits

17

because he had filed his claim late under section 913 or

18

because he gave notice late under section 912.

was denied benefits simply because he was a retiree, so - -

at the date at which it occurs, there will be no problem

for them.
MR. GILLIS:

4

It's not clear whether Mr. Redick

5

would or would not have had a problem with notice in the

6

statute of limitations if he would had gotten over the

7

retiree provisions.

8

Redick that tells us that.

I don't believe there's anything in

It's very arguable that if he had given notice

10

and had filed his claim very quickly after he got his

11

audiogram after he retired, he would have been all right

under those provisions.

13

so that change doesn't necessarily do anything about

It very well may have been, and I

13

think the important point is not whether it was or it was

is, what did Congress intend to do in light of Aduddell

Well, of course, they did at least

18

take care of the cases like asbestosis, or however you

pronounce it, where the injury does not really manifest

itself until 2 or 3 years later, and they may have thought

21

hearing loss was the same, but maybe they're wrong about

hearing loss, and maybe hearing loss does -- you know, is

an injury before retirement and therefore should be

treated like a loss of leg.

Congress thought that hearing loss was different -- not

whether it is or it isn't, but what Congress intended.

QUESTION:

Well, is that the case?

I mean,

if -- you know, if Congress says in a statute that X is

true, or X will be the result whenever Y is true, thinking

that Y is true in some situations where in fact it isn't

was true?

MR. GILLIS:

MR. GILLIS:

1

that Congress did not intend to draw a distinction between

2

hearing loss and other occupational diseases along the

3

lines that the Director suggested, and the reason I say

4

that is that first Congress intended to do something about

5

Redick.

6

Secondly, Congress repeatedly in the legislative

7

history mentions the problem that the disability from

8

occupational diseases do not become manifest until

9

oftentimes long after the injurious exposure occurs.

10

Hearing loss is that type of disease.

11

doesn't become manifest until the worker happens to have

12

his hearing tested, and that could be either before or

13

after retirement.

14

QUESTION:

It

Well, just as a practical matter, you

15

know, if I'm exposed to something that causes me to lose

16

my hearing and I find I used to be able to hear Justice

17

Blackmun quite well when he whispered to me, but now I

18

can't hear him at all, I don't need a hearing test to tell

19

me that I've lost my hearing, do I?

20

MR. GILLIS:

Well, you may feel subjectively

21

that you've lost your hearing, but you may not have what a

22

hearing test would show is an AMA percentage of hearing

23

impairment.

there's some medical test that is performed to show it?
MR. GILLIS:

2

3

In the case of hearing loss, I

would.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what if I break my arm.

That

5

manifests itself rather dramatically, doesn't it, without

6

necessarily going to a hospital and having an X-ray?

7

MR. GILLIS:

I agree with that, but -- and you

8

would know your disability if you couldn't work, but here

9

we're dealing with injuries as opposed to an occupational

10

disease that evolves over time, and again I think that the

11

date of manifestation and hearing loss is when the hearing

12

is tested and an AMA disability can be determined.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Gillis, can I follow up on a

4

question that Justice O'Connor asked you?

5

acknowledged in response to her question that the hearing

loss occurs immediately at the time of employment when

The court below, the First Circuit, found on the

So my initial point would be that the matter of

9

the amount to which Mr. Brown is entitled has been finally

determined -- it is not questioned before this Court -- so

11

that in the event the Court adopts the position of the

12

First Circuit, or adopts the position which was formally

13

held by the Benefits Review Board, Mr. Brown is allowed to

14

keep the benefits which he has already been awarded.

17

QUESTION:

I didn't understand the waiver to be

quite as broad as you say.
I think what they said was that if you use the

18

calculation based on sub-paragraph 13, there's no change,

19

because the fact that it's gone from whatever it might

20

have been at the date of retirement to 82 percent

21

shouldn't change that calculation, because we don't know

22

what it was at retirement, but they are arguing that if

you use section 23 you'll get a different answer --

approximately one half of what he has already received.

3

If the Court accepts the position which was

4

formerly held by the Benefits Review Board, it will

5

effectively reduce the amount of compensation to which

6

he's entitled by about one third, so we certainly have a

case of controversy if the Court decides that these

8

benefits should be recalculated.

9

On the issue of which particular system Congress

10

intended to use in this matter, let me first address the

11

position taken by the Director.

12

the retiree amendments which Congress enacted in 1984

13

simply do not apply, and we get back again, as the Court

14

did earlier in Mr. Gillis' argument to section 10 (i) .

15

The Director says that

10(i) applies only if the disease does not

16

immediately result in disability.

17

that because there is an immediate injury, that is, when

18

the worker is exposed to noise he has an immediate injury,

19

section 10 (i) does not apply.

20

The Director argues

If the Court reviews the definition of

21

disability which is contained in the statute -- and

22

remember, 10 (i) only applies if the disability does not

23

immediately occur.

24

that there must be a loss of wage-earning capacity.

MR. LUPTON:

2

That's correct, Your Honor, but for

3

the purposes of section 10 (i) , which doesn't refer to

4

scheduled awards, it simply says in the case of an injury

5

which does not immediately result in disability, then you

have to go and read the section which defines disability,

Under the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent

The Government agrees with the position adopted

5
6

by the First Circuit in this case, and it said that

7

subsection

8

specifically applies to hearing loss cases, is the

9

provision that should apply here, and we agree, Justice

whether or not the claim is filed while you're working or

12

after you're working, would be the same.

The employer in this case argues that subsection

the employee should get less if he's retired.

Well, you agree, I take it -- or do

you? -- that loss of hearing is an occupational disease.
MR. WRIGHT:

That's the provision that

We have not challenged that,

Justice Kennedy, and I should admit that the medical

treatise on which we rely refers to occupational hearing

You are correct in saying that the way

13

The way occupational hearing loss occurs is that

MR. WRIGHT:

2

Well, our answer to that is, this

3

Court noted in Pepco and has long been the rule, and I do

not believe is challenged by any party to this case, is

that scheduled injuries automatically call for recovery.

That's always been the rule.

QUESTION:

MR. WRIGHT:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. WRIGHT:

11

QUESTION:

And loss of earnings is assumed.
The loss of earning is presumed.
Which means that it's a disability.
That's right.
So the definition of disability

12

really is not -- I guess it isn't -- 8(c)(13) doesn't seem

13

to use

14

because it says in the case of disability partial in

15

character but permanent in quality.

16

talking about a loss of wages that is partial in character

17

but permanent in quality.

18

that is

19

MR. WRIGHT:

Now, they're not

They're talking about an injury

They're talking about a loss of

20

hearing which occurs immediately.

does not get worse after the noise goes away.

is true that occupational loss of hearing is immediate

2

because it does not progress following exposure to noise,

3

unquote.

That is correct.

We agree with that.

4

When you put section 10(i), due to an

5

occupational disease which does not immediately result in

6

disability, together with that fact, that occupational

7

hearing loss occurs immediately, then it is evident that

8

subsection 23, the special retiree rules that Congress

9

adopted in 1984, do not apply.

10

What applies instead is the schedule, subsection

11

13, which specifically covers hearing loss.

12

unsurprising conclusion, frankly, that the hearing loss

13

provision should apply in this hearing loss case.

14

It's a rather

Occupational hearing loss is different than

15

asbestos - related diseases, and perhaps it's helpful to

16

consider that in understanding subsection 23.

17

Asbestos fibers actually remain in the lungs and

10 or 20 years after the exposure to asbestos is removed,

19

they may then develop into cancerous growths of

20

mesothelioma, or they may then destroy enough of the lung

21

that a worker has asbestosis, but the asbestos fibers stay

22

in the lungs and continue to do damage.

23

When the worker is removed from the exposure to

24

excessive noise on the job he suffers no further loss from

25

that exposure.

stack of rules in subsection 23, a special rule in hearing

loss cases which is in subsection 13(d), which provides

that the time to file a claim for hearing loss doesn't run

it is the position of the director that the employer

I should note in this connection that OSHA has

Let me just state that if there were any

10

question about that, deference would be appropriate.

11

1985, 1 year after the relevant amendments, the Secretary

12

of Labor promulgated a regulation which we've reprinted at

13

14

In

The question was whether hearing loss claims

15

should be treated like other accidental injuries listed in

the schedule or whether they should be treated like

17

asbestosis in terms of when you have to file your notice.

18

It's 30 days in the case of accidental injuries and a year

in the case of asbestosis.

clearly 30 days, hearing loss is like an accidental

injury.

implausible.

draws a distinction and tries to make that distinction

the latency -- or, with the delay in time between exposure

21

and manifestation, and hearing loss has that same delay.

22

Congress was concerned with

Secondly, if Congress had intended after the '84

23

amendments for all hearing loss claims for retirees and

24

nonretirees to be treated under section 8(c)(13), there

25

would have been language in 8(c)(13) to say that.

8(c)(13) says nothing about retirement.
Third, if Congress had intended to exclude

2

Finally, the logical conclusion of the

inapplicable to hearing loss claims -- would take us back

17

to the principle that the average weekly wage is

several times by Congress.
