CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Respondents brought this suit to challenge a

13

1985 decision by the Indian Health Service to redirect the

14

work of a group of its employees from a regional to a

15

national effort to promote the availability of diagnostic

16

and related services for handicapped Indian children.

17

The employees' work was funded by a lump sum

18

appropriation from Congress for the Indian Health Service

19

and its 12,000 employees, 50 hospitals, 150 health

20

centers, and 300 health clinics.

21

authorized by the Snyder Act, the comprehensive statute

22

that authorizes Indian appropriations generally, and by

23

the Indian Health Services Improvement Act which from time

24

to time has provided supplemental funds to address

25

specific areas of Congress' concern.

The funds were

This case presents two questions.

2

whether judicial review under the Administrative Procedure

3

Act of the -- of an agency's allocation of funds from one

4

concededly authorized purpose to another is barred because

5

it is committed to agency discretion by law.

6

whether formal rule-making procedures, consisting of a

7

published notice in the Federal Register and opportunity

8

for comment, is required before the Indian Health Service

9

could redirect its resources in the manner that

10

We submit that the answer to both questions is

12

no, or that the court of appeals erred on both questions.

13

On the first, the court of appeals acknowledged that the

14

Snyder Act and the Indian Health Service Act do not

15

provide manageable standards for a court to apply in

16

reviewing the Indian Health Service's action here.

17

does the Lump Sum Appropriations Statute furnish any such

18

law.

19

sum for all of the authorized activities of the

20

statutes -- or of the agency under the statutes that

21

authorize its basic functions.

Nor

It's simply, as is typical of such statutes, a lump

22

The court of appeals instead concluded that

23

certain statements in the legislative history of the Lump

24

Sum Appropriations Statute furnished a basis for judicial

25

review.

In our view that is clearly wrong.

Statements in

QUESTION:

You -- you have a text here which is,

6

you know, a certain amount of money.

7

doesn't -- you don't know what that money's supposed to be

8

used for, and this legislative history clarifies what it's

9

to be used for.

And you don't -- it

Why is that any different from a piece of

10

legislative history that clarifies the meaning of a

11

prohibition?

12

agency can take a number of different views of what it

means.

It's totally ambiguous.

for which the court of appeals used the language in this

case.

19

legislative history helped to clarify the statutory text.

20

The court really used the legislative history as a

21

substitute for the statutory text.

It did not focus on language in the Lump Sum

The statutory text here simply authorizes the

to the Snyder Act or the Indian Health -- Indian Health
statute to look for any law to apply.
And the -- the Snyder Act, for example, and the
court of appeals, again, didn't find anything in the text
of the -- of the Snyder Act or the Indian Health Care
Improvement Act that would furnish law to apply in this
case.

The Snyder Act, as this Court pointed out in Morton

v. Ruiz, is deliberately comprehensive.

It was enacted in

response to the -- the time when points of order were
raised against Indian appropriations because there was no
authorizing statute.
QUESTION:

Well I suppose those acts would --

would provide law to apply for some questions that might
arise under them.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

If -- if the claim were

that the -- that the Indian Health Service were -- were -QUESTION:

They were providing help for

non-Indians.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Exactly.

But there -- I don't

there can be any question here that the reallocation or
redirection of the work that the Indian Health Service
made in this case was authorized by the statute.

It

simply redirected the employees' work from a regional -regionally focused program to a national program, to
assure available services for Indian children.

Whether -- whether you can go to a

No, I -- I think not.

to be perhaps an under utilized area.

It wasn't even integrated into

21

data and approaches for a nationwide program.

22

when -- when the Indian Health Service redirected the

23

activities of the employees, the thought was that rather

24

than have these employees do monthly consultations --

the utilization of the employees for this nationwide

effort is somehow beyond the -- the scope of what the

But I don't think there's -- there can be any

Snyder Act or the Indian Health Care Act would authorize.
QUESTION:

Well, do you think that the

12

discretion provided under these acts is any greater than,

for example, the discretion given to -- was it the

14

Department of Transportation in the State Farm case?

could promulgate a motor vehicles standards.

2

there were certain criteria at certain levels of safety

3

that had to be satisfied that gave -- that gave a court

4

law to apply.

5

Here the -- again, the Snyder Act was intended

6

to cover essentially every possible activity that the BIA

7

and now the Indian Health Service might engage in, so that

8

there could be no question of a point of order when funds

9

were appropriated to cover those funds.

statute that -- that authorizes an agency -- instructs an

12

agency to pro - - and this is an instruction to - - to

14

that are harmful to the environment.

anticipate that this will include prohibition of, and then

in -- in determining whether the agency had authority to,

MR. KNEEDLER:

1

It might be taken into account in

construing the term harmful, I guess is the statutory --

the operative word there.

QUESTION:

Well, and the operative word here

5

is -- is purposes authorized by these other statutes.

6

What purposes in particular?

7
8

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, here's one.

Well,

the -- the Snyder Act,

for

example, broadly appropriates funds for the benefit -directs the BIA to - - to supervise the expenditure of

10

funds that Congress may from time to time appropriate for

11

the benefit, care, and assistance of Indians throughout

12

the United States for a variety of services, as relevant

13

here "relief of distress" and "conservation of Indians."

14

Now, again,

if the claim here were this is

15

not -- this money is not being spent for the relief of

16

distress or conservation of the health of Indians or for

17

any of the other purposes in the act, that would be law to

the concededly authorized purposes, there's no - - there is

20

no law to apply in the text or legislative history of the

21

Snyder Act or the Indian Health Care Improvements Act that

22

would help a court to decide that question.

23

But our point is that in - - in choosing among

Now --

Could you -- could you imagine a case

in which the legislative history would contain an

indication of congressionally ordered priorities so that

1

the legislative history would somehow indicate that the

2

first priority in the Snyder Act is for disabled children?
MR. KNEEDLER:

3

I -- I can imagine that sort of

4

legislative history, but I think in some respects that's

5

very much like the American Hospital Association Case this

6

Court had several terms back where there - - where there

7

was legislative history about the -- the expectations.

8

And the way the Court thought the National Labor Relations

Board - -

QUESTION:

And -- is that -- and is that law to

apply if the agency ignores the funding obligation?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

Not -- not unless --

The funding priority?
Not unless that legislative

15

history is tied to something in statutory texts that

16

mandates that result.

18

some years back, where the -- the court pointed out that

19

legislative history of -- of expectations in the way that

20

Congress expected that expected that funds may be expended

21

are simply expectations, they aren't legally binding

22

requirements.

23

I think this is very much like the

That's not to say they don't furnish

protections, because congressional oversight in the

QUESTION:

Courts are not generally suited to

Well, so -- so long as the spending

is authorized by one of three statutory mandates, there

8

can be no review as to how the agency allocates the

When review is precluded,

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Because -- because it - -

10

well, the phrase no law to apply is a phrase that this

11

Court has developed for applying what is -- what is really

12

different statutory language under the APA, which is

13

whether the agency action is committed to agency

14

discretion by law.

15

in the sort of example that -- that you're describing, the

conclusion would be that Congress has committed the

allocation of resources in a whole variety of

18

circumstances to the -- to the discretion of the Indian

19

Health Service.

20

That's the ultimate touchstone.

In part from necessity, because if courts were

21

going to get in the business of second guessing every

decision of resource allocation, whether to purchase

equipment for one hospital and not another, whether to

This program, the Indian Children's Program, was
implemented in a direct response to the Indian Health Care
Improvement Act, which was passed in 1976.

That act was

passed to provide supplemental funding for Indian
programs, supplemental to the Snyder Act.
Title II of the Indian Health Care Improvement
Act specifically authorizes funding for known unmet Indian
health needs and specifically authorizes funding for
therapeutic and residential treatment centers.

It was in

response to that language in this act that the agency
implemented this Indian Children's Program.
QUESTION:

Did it engage in rule making when it

instituted the program?
MR. JASPERSE:

It did not, Your Honor.

Initially, the agency envisioned a $3.5 million facility.
That was never funded.

They initially chose to center

that facility near Albuquerque for a number of reasons,

One of the reasons was they did not feel that an

small, and provided these diagnostic and treatment
services.
What's also important to understand is that
throughout the operation of this program every year in
testimony to the congressional committees regarding
appropriations, the agency continuously told the agency,
this is a critical program for these children, it's a
successful program, we are providing these specific
diagnostic and treatment services to them, certain
children are eligible for these services and we want
continued funding for this program.
And Congress appears to have responded favorably
to these requests.

They received the information in a

favorable light and we think there was -- this showed
intent by the Congress, through its appropriations
committee, to continue this program in the form that the
agency then did.
In October 1984, officials in the Rockville,

Service began urging that this program be changed, that

are that there is an -- under the Indian Trust

this Court in Morton v. Ruiz, is to mean anything --

Not -- not -- I'm not arguing

No.

I'm arguing that in this

1

Well, but I think you're simply

2

reading that much too broadly from our cases.

3

think our cases have said there is any general duty to

Health Service was not the primary provider of care in

10

First, on the

It was always a backup or secondary

consultative role that IHS personnel were performing.
The children involved had primary care givers

11
12

and the Indian Health Service did give individualized

13

notice to the primary care givers and held community

14

meetings to assist them in developing alternative

15

resources, which was the sort of approach appropriate to

16

the circumstances.

17

In addition, notice and comment is not well

18

suited to obtaining the input of the Indian people in a

19

circumstance such as this.

20

Indian Health Service has been indifferent to the need to

21

get input, but they've chosen a different way, which

22

was -- which was a system of consultation with the tribes

concerned.

would, in GAO's view and the executive branch's view,

change that process radically.

One, the statements in the committee reports have

17

various demands on the agency's time and energy, and that

18

is, again, necessarily something committed to agency

19

discretion.
