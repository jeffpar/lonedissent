CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

5

Justice v. Vincent James Landano.

Mr. Daly.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN F. DALY

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DALY:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case involves exemption 7(D) of the Freedom

10
11

of Information Act, which permits the FBI and other

12

Federal law enforcement agencies to protect the identities

13

of confidential sources and also, in the case of criminal

14

law investigations, the information provided by those

15

sources.

16

The specific question presented here is what

17

exactly the FBI must do in district court to establish

18

that a particular source may be treated as a confidential

19

one.

20

Seven of the U.S. circuit courts of appeals have

21

adopted the approach that we urge on the Court today.

22

That is, to allow the FBI to carry its burden by means of

23

a categorical showing in which the FBI shows that each of

24

the documents at issue falls within a category of

25

sources -- for example, State and local law enforcement

1

agencies, for which an assurance of confidentiality is

2

inherently implicit in the normal course of events.

3

On the other hand, the court of appeals in the

4

present case has set down a rigid rule that the FBI cannot

5

invoke exemption 7(D) unless it can provide "detailed

6

explanations relating to each alleged confidential

7

source."
We submit that the FBI should indeed be able to

8

9

proceed on the basis of a categorical showing presuming

10

confidentiality for these types of sources in the absence

11

of an indication otherwise.

12

reasons - -

There are two essential

13

QUESTION:

What types of sources are you

14

referring to again, Mr. Daly?

15

MR. DALY:

The categories are indeed broad, Your

16

Honor.

17

that the individuals who provide information to the FBI in

18

the course of a criminal investigation normally do so with

19

an inherent understanding, an implied understanding of

20

confidentiality.

21

For example, in this case the FBI has contended

QUESTION:

So your contention is that it should

22

be enough to invoke exemption 7 if the FBI shows that the

23

statement made by a particular individual was made to an

24

FBI agent investigating a crime.

25

MR. DALY:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

QUESTION:

1

And that would be true even, for

2

example, if the FBI were contacting some State authority-

3

in another State to determine somebody's whereabouts, or

4

their criminal record, or anything of that kind.

5
6

MR. DALY:
because as the --

7
8

Very much so, Justice O'Connor,

QUESTION:

Even though you wouldn't normally

think that would be considered confidential.

9

MR. DALY:

I would beg to disagree, Justice

10

O'Connor, because as the declaration in the present case

11

indicates, there is a particular tradition of

12

confidentiality in the sort of information exchanged

13

between law enforcement agencies.

14

When the law enforcement agencies and the FBI

15

exchange information, there is a tacit understanding,

16

which I believe the declaration in the present case said,

17

for example, is reinforced in the daily contacts that FBI

18

special agents have with local law enforcement agencies.

19
20

QUESTION:

a matter of public record in that State.

21
22

23

Even as to routine information that's

MR. DALY:

Well, something like arrest

QUESTION:

It just strikes me that there could

expectation.

1

MR. DALY:

Well, I think, Justice O'Connor,

2

what's important is not necessarily the subjective

3

expectation of each individual, and the problem, as we've

4

pointed out, is that to base the rule on the content of

5

the information raises very problematic issues, because

6

certainly when people are contacted, they -- what they

7

know for sure is they're talking to an FBI agent about a

8

matter of criminal law.

9

presentation.

10

That's the entire premise for our

An individual, or even a local police

11

department, may not necessarily know what information will

12

be particularly salient, and certainly in many

13

investigations -- after all, the present one involves the

14

murder of a police officer.

15

the surface to be routine - -

16

QUESTION:

Even the -- what may seem on

Well, perhaps the circumstances of a

17

particular investigation would certainly justify the

18

assumption in some cases.

19

gang-related killing or something, I think most people

20

would think those circumstances would give rise to a

21

presumption of constitutionality, but I'm not sure it

22

applies across the board.

23

MR. DALY:

For instance, a witness of a

Well, I think the important point,

24

Justice O'Connor, is that we need a starting point for

25

this analysis.

The problem, as we point out, both in

1

terms of the statutory language and the underlying

2

policies of exemption 7(D) is that you need a realistic

3

starting point because, if one has to rely on the content

4

of the information, of the particular crime that's at

5

stake, the protection that's going to be provided is going

6

to be very unreliable, and that's one of the keys to this

7

case, I think.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, I mean if you can determine

from the particular circumstances that there is a

10

likelihood of the presumption of confidentiality, that's

11

one thing, but I wonder if it should be applied across the

12

board?

13

MR. DALY:

Well, Your Honor, I think the main

14

circumstance that we do know is that we know that

15

someone -- say, an individual -- has provided information

16

to the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation.

17

That very fact is very important, because the FBI has a

18

decades-long tradition of maintaining the confidentiality

19

of its records.

20

QUESTION:

Does the - - is it a practice at the

21

FBI for any kind of notation to be put in the file in

22

connection with each witness interview as to whether it's

23

confidential or not --

24

MR. DALY:

No, Justice O'Connor.

25

QUESTION:

Or whether there's been any

assurance?
MR. DALY:

2

3

No, Justice O'Connor, and that is one

of the key problems here.

4

QUESTION:

But I guess you could do that.

5

MR. DALY:

It potentially could be done

6

prospectively.

We would submit that Congress hasn't

7

imposed such a requirement on the FBI, and that in itself

8

would be a very dramatic departure from the way the FBI is

9

doing business now, and on a practical level as well,

10

this -- the respondent has tried to characterize our

11

position as something new, some change.

12

the way the FBI has been proceeding throughout the history

13

of exemption 7(D) since it was enacted in 1974.

14

In fact, this is

Even if one were to say that oh, the FBI could

15

change the way it does business in the future,

(a) that in

16

itself would be a change that should come from Congress

17

and not the courts, and (b) that would do nothing for the

18

enormous storehouse of information which exists right now.

19

I mean, if the Court were to say, well, it's all

20

well and good, but the FBI has to show us specific

21

circumstances, for most of what's there it simply doesn't

22

exist.

23

QUESTION:

Well, how about having to show just

24

the general circumstances surrounding the situation?

25

That's -8

MR. DALY:

1

I think part of the problem that we

2

have with the respondent's view and with the view of the

3

court of appeals is that they've never told us exactly

4

what circumstances they want to hear, and frankly we have

5

to question how useful the information would be, if one is

6

talking about the physical circumstances -- there was no

7

one else in the room.

The door was closed.

QUESTION:

Well, how about the nature of the

10

MR. DALY:

The nature --

QUESTION:

And the witness' relation to it?

12

MR. DALY:

That is something that we will

crime - -

13

sometimes be able to tell from the face of the documents,

14

but there again, I think one of the keys which we discuss

15

in our brief is the fact that Congress was aware that - -

16

what needs reliable protection for sources, and in our

17

view the language of the statute gives great flexibility

18

in this regard.

After all --

19

QUESTION:

Well, on that point --

20

QUESTION:

It could have said that so easily and

21

so explicitly.

Congress had the opportunity to say,

"All

22

investigatory records of law enforcement agencies."

23

didn't.

24

by simply saying,

25

enforcement agencies provided by confidential sources."

It

It would be so easy to say that, and you say that
"all investigatory records of law

You're saying essentially,

3

MR. DALY:

"provided by confidential

No, not really, Justice Scalia.

You

4

must recall that there are a number of sources that the

5

FBI deals with that wouldn't qualify as confidential at

all.

There are many published sources -- for example,
books and magazines.

Wiretaps can be very important

Now, those are all sources, in the

13

QUESTION:

You do not treat them as privileged.

14

MR. DALY:

No, we do not, because the rationale

15

that we're talking about here just doesn't apply to those

16

kinds of sources.

1

MR. DALY:

There

2

QUESTION:

That's extraordinary.

3

MR. DALY:

I don't think so, Justice Scalia,

4

because when you think -- if we wiretap you, obviously

5

without your knowledge, there is nothing in those

6

circumstances from which a reasonable person could assume

7

that there was an assurance of confidentiality.
When -- in 1974, when Congress enacted exemption

8

9

7(D), the language that Congress used in the background

10

was to say that a confidential source is one who provides

11

information under an express assurance of confidentiality,

12

or in circumstances from which such an assurance could

13

reasonably be inferred.

reasonable inference about confidentiality when you're

15

just talking on your phone.

QUESTION:

You certainly can make no

How could I

possibly have that --

MR. DALY:

Of course.

Exactly.

MR. DALY:

But that's key, and that's a key

limitation.

That might be exempt under some other

something which we generally would give out, but the

2

rationale that we're talking about today would not apply

3

to that at all.
QUESTION:

4

What would you generally give out,

5

outside of newspaper clippings?

6

information would be saved by this carefully crafted

7

exemption.
MR. DALY:

8

9

Well, the kinds of information I've

just talked about, and also anything -QUESTION:

11

What vast amount of

What kind, newspaper clippings and

things obtained from --

12

MR. DALY:

Things that came --

13

QUESTION:

Magazine clippings.

14

MR. DALY:

If it weren't subject to some other

15

exemption, something such as information provided by

16

unwitting sources who talked to an undercover agent.

17

Also, anything that the FBI agents themselves do.
If they're -- there are plenty of documents that

19

were given out in this case that refer to what the agents

20

themselves were doing.

21

the document and it doesn't relay information that was

22

given to the FBI by a source, then certainly that could go

23

out.

25

QUESTION:

As long as that is the subject of

Mr. Daly, even on your theory of sort

of the implicit understanding that you find inherent in

1

just the relationship between the investigator who

2

identifies himself as such and the subject, aren't there

3

two possible implicit understandings in the absence of

4

anything explicit to the contrary?

5

One may be that yeah, I'm talking to the FBI

6

about a matter which it would be very dangerous to talk

7

about, and I may assume that if they talk with them

8

they're not going to spill the beans on me, but the other

9

understand proceeds, doesn't it, from the fact that most

10

people realize that the Government prosecutes crime in

11

open courtrooms.
And if you give evidence to the FBI which tends

12

13

to incriminate, isn't it reasonable to suppose that you

14

are quite likely going to be called to give that same kind

15

of evidence in a courtroom, and how - - on your theory we

16

ignore the second category, and I don't see how we can

17

ignore that - -

18

MR. DALY:

I don't

19

QUESTION:

Even on your theory of implicit

20

understanding.
MR. DALY:

21

I don't think we ignore it, Justice

22

Souter.

23

recognized that there were degrees of confidentiality.

24

There's also a very good discussion of that point by Judge

25

Silberman in the Mary Jones case.

Even the court of appeals in the present case

1

QUESTION:

Well, there are, but they're never --

2

on your -- maybe I misunderstand your position, but as I

3

understand it, on your position the possibility of there

4

being a lesser degree of confidentiality implicit with

5

respect to a given witness is in all probability never

6

going to be known or investigated.

7

I mean, how are -- if the burden is on the

8

claimant for the information to say well, I ought to know

9

who this is, because this is probably a person who would

10

have understand that he might have to testify, how is that

11

person going to make that case, on your view?

12

MR. DALY:

Well, I think we have two answers

13

there, Justice Souter, and first of all I would have to

14

take issue with the notion that a person who thought that

15

he might have to testify, or even that he would probably

16

have to testify, such a person could still have an implied

17

assurance of confidentiality to an important degree.

18
19
20

This case doesn't expressly pose the issue of
waiver, but several of the lower courts -QUESTION:

Well, he could have, but if he

21

doesn't say -- if he says something, then you're not

22

resting on implication.

23

involved, and the agent says, don't worry, you won't have

24

to be, just tell me what you know, then you're not resting

25

on your implication, but if the person says nothing, I

1

suppose it's reasonable to expect that the individual knew

2

that he might have to give evidence.

3

MR. DALY:

I don't think that's so at all, and I

4

think it's important to remember that when Congress was

5

enacting 7(D) it specifically stated that confidentiality

6

was not to be limited to express confidentiality, and

7

that, I think, is one of the key problems with

8

respondent's view.

9

Essentially, what they're asking for is that if

10

you -- if the FBI is required to make this fact-specific

11

showing, and not even knowing what circumstances are going

12

to satisfy most district courts, what we're probably going

13

to be left with as the only way that we can reliably

14

protect confidentiality is expressed confidentiality, but

15

Congress didn't say that.

16

Congress said that they wanted to protect

17

sources who receive express assurances of confidentiality,

18

or who provided information under circumstances in which

19

an implication of confidentiality would naturally follow.

20

QUESTION:

Well, how about my --

21

QUESTION:

You said Congress said that.

22

Where

did Congress say that?
MR. DALY:

That's in the legislative history,

committee, do you know?
MR. DALY:

5

I can't give you the exact number,

6

as we've pointed out, that conference committee report was

7

a fairly key juncture of the legislation because there

8

were changes made in the conference committee before it
was finally enacted by Congress, but to return -QUESTION:

10

I think I'm still left with the

11

problem that I raised, and that is, on your theory I'm not

12

quite sure how the claimant for the information is ever

13

going to be in a very good position to say, oh, well, this

14

is a person --we offer to prove, for example, that this

15

is a person who would not have reasonably expected

16

confidentiality.
MR. DALY:

17

We acknowledge, Justice Souter, that

18

it's going to be very difficult for them to make such a

1

showing.

20

actually, the other part of your question that I don't

21

think I got to yet, which is the notion that a person who

22

thinks that he might be called upon the testify later

23

would necessarily not have an implication of

24

confidentiality, and we would take strong issue with that.

25

This case doesn't expressly involve the issue of

I'd like to get to that.

waiver, but that's another issue that the courts have

2

dealt with extensively.

en banc decision of the First Circuit in the Irons case.

4

In that case, that court recognized that there

One of the leading cases is the

is called upon the testify, there may be much about that

person's involvement with the FBI that remains

11

We don't always know, even after a person
There

may be important things left.
As Judge Bryer concluded for the court there,

12

that residuum of confidentiality is itself extremely

13

important, and so therefore I'd say to you first of all

14

that a person who talks to the FBI merely knowing that he

normal expectations I think of all citizens based on the

Indeed, even if there were -- even if

you required an assurance of confidentiality, an explicit

assurance, you couldn't give an assurance of

17

at least extends beyond that point which came out in

criterion that there are degrees of confidentiality, and

20

that degree would be determined by the extent to which the

confidentiality was invaded by public testimony.

You would say, well, the confidentiality

MR. DALY:

Yes, but far more typically this

typical document in question, an FBI interview report with

a witness.

Jones spoke to John Smith of 123 Main Street on February

24th.

That report may begin that special agent Mary

Smith related the following information.
And the document may then go on to give the

7

information, giving nothing about the circumstances of the

interview, but also giving nothing that would indicate

that the normal presumption of confidentiality shouldn't

apply, and the question is, what is the FBI to do with

that?

Certainly we seem not to be able to meet the

13

court of appeals test requiring specific circumstances

14

regarding the interview, but as a practical starting point

15

we submit that, yes, based on common sense and based on

16

the FBI's tradition of confidentiality there should be the

starting point that should be used by both the FBI and a

reviewing court that yes, there is an implication of

confidentiality there.

Do you remember what the earliest

I'm not sure, Justice White, when the

Of course, before 1974 the issue didn't arise because of

the very broad exemption that they had under exemption 7,

MR. DALY:

Well, as I said, you can go back to

some reason for doubt even within the Third Circuit

because of different decisions, but apart from the Third

is often the way

things wind up working under FOIA, because the plaintiff

2

never has the documents to begin with.

3

Certainly, if there's any particular reason to

think that the circumstances are unusual, if the plaintiff

5

could articulate something, then perhaps that would

justify in camera review.

we mentioned in our reply brief there was a recent Tenth

Circuit case in which we invoked this theory and the Tenth

9

Circuit deemed it appropriate to look at the documents and

That's always available, and as

they said, yes, we've determined that's right.
I think in the absence of some articulable

12

reason to think that there was something unusual going on,

13

then yes, you should keep to the presumption that there is

an implied confidentiality here.

QUESTION:

Mr. Daly, you gave some examples

earlier of, say, an undercover agent talking to people,

in this case that that is not what happened in this case,

Do you identify those cases in which

The FBI offers essentially three arguments in

calling a pragmatic argument, which is that the FBI --

2

that if the presumption that the FBI seeks here today is

3

not granted there will be some sort of administrative or

4

adjudicative havoc, that the FBI is not prepared to come

forward with case-specific proofs in the event this Court

6

affirms the Third Circuit, that the FBI doesn't maintain

7

records of confidentiality.
Even though confidentiality is so important, the

FBI tells us, they maintain no records, so that an agent

in 1952 doesn't know whether in 1946 a source was assured

the affirmative posture of its main brief that the 1986

20

This argument is somewhat of a moving

In their reply brief the FBI seems to shift from

evaluating, because the FBI has not provided this Court,

20

or Congress for that matter, with a record.

What I'm suggesting is that the FBI probably has

a higher level of detail in its files than it suggests

circumstances surrounding interviews with sources where in

fears.

I suggest that it is not worthy of credence when

19

the FBI tells us here that they don't have records that

20

can satisfy a more --a higher level of specificity.

The law has been unsettled in this area.

22

Certainly one reading Vaughn v. Rosen in 1974 would not

1

And then there was Lame in 1981, and there was

2

Keeney in 1980, a Second Circuit case that seemed to echo

3

the Third Circuit's rule, and there was the Dearing

4

Milliken case in 1977 that said, whether or not a source

5

is confidential is a question of fact.

6

Is it possible that the FBI, in the face of an

7

unsettled body of law, took the most aggressive approach

8

and said we'll follow the majority rule even before it was

9

a majority rule and didn't keep records in the event this

10

Court should some day resolve this unsettled body of law

11

by saying no, this presumption has no basis in this

12

statute, this presumption has no factual basis?

13

That proposition is not worthy of credence.

I

14

submit that the FBI obeyed the law in the Third Circuit,

15

as they had to, and that the FBI made case-specific

16

determinations, at least within that circuit and that,

17

given the unsettled nature of the law, the FBI kept

18

accurate records such as the director relied on, such as

Too bad.

Your Honor, a number of answers.

I

think that's a very, very weighty question, and when I

make the argument here I'm not unaware of the dangers that

9

exist for informants.
Fortunately, 7(D) is not the only way Congress

10
11

dealt with that problem.

7(F), as you know, was expanded,

12

if an informant's, or confidential source's, or anybody's

The FBI didn't
