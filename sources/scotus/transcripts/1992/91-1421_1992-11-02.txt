ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

The question in this case which affects billions

11

of dollars of revenues under the minimum tax is ultimately

12

a quite narrow one:

13

the adjusted basis of a depletable mineral deposit?

14

what costs are properly included in

While the question is a narrow one, its

15

background is somewhat complex.

16

treatment of mineral deposits has created a sizable

17

incentive or tax preference for mining activities.

18

mineral depletion allowance for mineral deposits differs

19

dramatically from the ordinary depreciation of other types

20

of wasting assets.

21

a portion of the total income derived from the mineral

22

deposit.

23

continues, even long after the total costs of the mineral

24

deposit have been fully recovered.

MR. JONES:

Under section 1915 of the Energy

Policy Act of 1992, which was enacted 2 weeks ago,

18

Congress has exempted the restricted minimum -- I'm

19

sorry - - percentage depletion allowance for independent

20

oil producers from the coverage of the minimum tax.

21

Congress left in place the application of the minimum tax

22

to all other types of percentage depletion allowances.

Well,

that certainly indicates that

at least the present Congress isn't viewing the situation

MR. JONES:

1

Actually what we think and what I

2

believe the statute reflects is that there are two ways to

3

attack abusive tax preferences.

4

is the way the minimum tax works.

5

restrict the availability of the preference.

6

Congress has done since

7

alone is to create a statute, 6 3(a), which very narrowly

8

restricts the availability of the depletion allowance for

They have removed the availability of

producers, the amount of depletion from an unlimited

And perhaps most importantly, in section

20

6 3(a)(D), Congress has provided that the oil and gas

21

depletion allowance cannot be used to exempt more than 65

22

percent of the total income of the taxpayer, and so in

23

that manner, Congress has avoided the spectacle of the

24

depletion allowance being used to exempt all of the

25

taxpayer's income, which is the function of the minimum

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Jones,

since I have you

3

interrupted, may I ask one other question?

4

the regulation,

5

this case, and yet your brief doesn't really address it or

6

discuss it.

7

I thought that

1.571(h), was particularly relevant in

MR. JONES:

Well, we address it in the sense

8

that all that regulation does is refer the reader to

9

section 1016 of the code for adjustments to basis.

10

one of the depletion regulations has the same

11

cross-reference, and the significance of that --

12

QUESTION:

Every

Well, but this regulation 1.57 at

13

least can be read to mean that the special rule referred

14

to in the regulation 1.612 doesn't apply.

15

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Well,
And so,

there's -I just wondered why you

didn't even talk about it.
MR. JONES:

There's at least two reasons why

19

that regulation has no relevance to the Court's decision

20

in this case.

21

1016 -- if you look at 1016(a)(2),

22

downward adjustments to basis for depletion allowances.

23

That is the reason that 57 and the regs under 61,

24

itself, all refer to 1016.

25

adjusted basis of a mineral deposit is adjusted downward

The first is that the reference to

each year.
The other and perhaps more important reason why

2

3

0 6 has no ultimate relevance to this case is because the

4

court simply misunderstood what the - - how that statute

5

works, and if you like,

6

to it in the course of the discussion.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. JONES:

I can address it now or I can come

As you wish.
Well,

I think it might be helpful if

9

I put it into the context of the overall discussion in

0

this case.

11
12

Section 57 recognizes that the percentage
depletion allowance is a tax preference only to the extent

3

that the allowance exceeds the adjusted basis of the

4

mineral deposit.

5

the apparently elementary one of how the adjusted basis of

6

a mineral deposit is determined.

7

include only the intangible costs of acquiring and

8

developing the deposit, or as the courts below concluded,

9

does it also include the costs of depreciable physical

20
21

The question presented in this case is

Does it, as we contend,

property used in connection with production?
In our view, which all of the commentators have

22

agreed with,

23

statute and the regulations and in the decisions of this

24

Court, as well as in the history of the minimum tax.

25

the answer is clearly set forth in the

Under section 6

of the code,

the costs of the

1

mineral deposit are to be recovered by depletion, and the

2

costs of physical improvements are to be recovered by

3

depreciation.

4

recover these different types of costs, the regulations

5

specifically require that the basis of the depletable

6

minerals be maintained separately from the basis of the

7

depreciable improvements.

8

basis of the mineral deposit does not include amounts

9

recoverable through depreciation deductions.

Since separate methods are employed to

The regulations state that the

This is what

10

Justice O'Connor was referring to as perhaps the special

11

rule.
But if you look at section 1.611-2(b)(2) of the

12

13

regulations, you'll see that it is not a special rule that

14

applies only to cost depletion because the regulation says

15

in no event shall percentage depletion in excess of the

16

basis of the mineral deposit be credited to the

17

depreciable improvements account.

20

Congress did not -- I'm

The Service -- and these, by the way, are

The Service quite clearly did not intend to

21

allow these bases to be commingled.

In 1937, they issued

22

a ruling which states -- and I quote -- the basis of

23

depletable property must be set up as an item separate

24

from the basis of depreciable property.

25

in this case is ultimately and directly answered by the

So, the question

1

regulations.
The agency's longstanding requirement that a

2

3

separate basis be maintained reflects a fundamental

4

principle of tax accounting.

5

Commissioner v. Ferrar, the bases of even closely related

6

assets must be maintained separately when one is subject

7

to one kind of tax treatment and the other is subject to a

8

different kind.

As Judge Friendly said in

It was for this very reason that in the United

9
10

States v. Dakota-Montana case in 1933 this Court rejected

11

the taxpayer's claim that depletable property could be

12

recovered through depreciation.

13

different types of costs must be recovered through the

14

separate mechanisms that Congress provided, and the basis

15

of the two types of property, therefore, can't be

16

commingled.

17

The Court said that those

The Court said essentially the same thing in

18

Parsons v. Smith when they said -- and I quote --

19

depreciable equipment is not an investment in the minerals

20

in place.

21

The legislative history of the '86 amendments to

22

the minimum tax confirms this same distinction, for the

23

conference report to the bill stated that the depletion

24

preference under section 57 is -- and I quote again -- the

25

excess of the depletion allowance over the adjusted basis

1

of the depletable property.

It is, after all, excess

2

depletion, not excess depreciation that the depletion tax

3

preference in section 57 addresses.

4

Well, what the court below concluded,

5

notwithstanding all of this evidence, was that the costs

6

of depreciable equipment should be included in the

7

adjusted basis of the depletable property because the

8

court concluded that this kind of physical property

9

represents an improvement to the mineral deposit, and the

10

court thought that under section

11

improvements are necessarily to be merged into the basis

12

of the assets that they improve.

That in turn --

In that event, I suppose the

improvements or the tangible assets that you think are

depreciable wouldn't be - - there wouldn't be a

MR. JONES:

MR. JONES:

MR. JONES:

1

Well, they -- if you will notice,

2

under the regs under 612 and 611, they also refer the

3

reader to the regs under section 1016.

4

trying to say earlier, that is because 1016(a)(2) requires

5

that the basis be adjusted downward each year as depletion

6

is taken.

7

And as I was

But there's a -- there's a larger philosophical

8

and practical point here that I haven't had a chance to

9

explain.

Under section 1016, the costs of

10

improvements -- under 1016(a)(1), the costs of

11

improvements are not always added to the basis of the

12

asset they improve.

13

asset when, as the statute says, it is proper to do so.

14

If we take the simple example of a commercial

They are to be merged only with that

15

structure built on a tract of land, the land is not a

16

depreciable asset.

17

to be maintained in a basis separate from the costs of the

18

commercial structure which is depreciable.

19

regulations under section 167(a)(5) require that result.

20

So, even though the commercial structure can be said to be

21

an improvement to the land, the costs of that improvement

22

have to be maintained in a separate basis.

23

The costs of the land are, therefore,

here and that the Government is focusing on the rules for

calculating the depletion deduction; whereas section 57

The title of these regulations is Basis for Cost

Depletion, and if you look at section 612-1(a) of those

regulations, they tell you that the basis upon which the

MR. ROBINSON:

If you

Because, Your Honor, I believe

16

there's a difference between the rules for calculating

17

adjusted basis for property on the sale of the property

18

and the rules for calculating the depletion deduction.

19

Adjusted basis is an aggregate concept.

If you

20

would turn back to our discussion on page 2 of the

21

regulations under section 1016, section 1016-2(a) of the

22

regulations, which discuss the rules for calculating the

23

adjusted basis of property, it makes it clear that this is

24

an aggregate concept.

25

What we're trying to identify in the calculation

1

of adjusted basis is all the capital outlays that are

2

associated with the property that are taken into account

3

in connection with computing the gain or loss on the sale

4

of that property.

5

tell us that adjusted basis includes the cost of

6

improvements or betterments made to the property.

7

no qualification on the kind of improvements or

8

betterments that are added to adjusted basis.

They use

9

the word including without any qualification.

So, for

10

And these regulations very specifically

There's

example -QUESTION:

11

But it depends on what you mean by

12

the property.

13

between you and the Government.

14

I mean, that's the essential dispute

MR. ROBINSON:

No, I don't believe that's true,

15

Your Honor.

We agree that the property is the taxpayer's

16

interest in the mineral deposit that's identified in

17

section 614, but the issue is not what the cost of that

18

property is, because section 57(a)(8) tells us that we

19

have to compute the adjusted basis of that property in

20

order to determine the tax preference item for depletion.
And in computing adjusted basis, we have to take

21
22

into account a variety of costs associated with the

23

property.

24

installed a new furnace into that building, that new

25

furnace would be an improvement to the building.

For example, if we had a building and we

SUITE 400

And when

1

we went to sell the building, we would include the

2

unrecovered cost of that furnace in our calculation of

3

adjusted basis in computing the gain or loss.

4

furnace might be subject to -- we may have already

5

depreciated down the building.

6

another cost recovery method.

Now, that

It might be subject to

7

Or, for example, if we had a parcel of land and

8

we installed a fence on that land, that fence would be an

9

improvement to the land.

And we went to sell it, we would

10

include the cost of that fence even though in that case

11

the land would not be subject to depreciation, but the

12

fence would be.

13

So, by focusing under the section 57 regulations

14

on the adjusted basis of the property, I believe that this

15

is a fundamentally different concept, and that explains

16

why there has to be a special rule under the section 612

17

regulations because a variety of items that may not be

18

subject to the depletion deduction, such as tangibles

19

whose costs are recovered through depreciation, have to be

20

withdrawn from the calculation in order to compute the

21

amount of cost depletion since those amounts aren't --

22

those costs are not recoverable through the depreciation

23

-- the depletion deduction.

24
25

Now, as was pointed out earlier in the
discussion, the section 57 regulations are very

significant on this point because these regulations do not

2

contain any reference to a special rule.

3

cross-reference is directly to the general rule for

4

calculating adjusted basis under this regulation at

5

1016-2(a), and as a consequence, we should be entitled to

6

take those improvements into the calculation in computing

adjusted basis.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14

MR. JONES:

Thank you.

I did want to clear up

15

what seemed to me to have been a confusion in the

16

discussion that I just heard.

17

The respondents claim a right to depreciate the

18

physical property.

They also claim a right to add the

19

costs of that property into the basis of the mineral

20

deposit for purposes of determining the amount of the tax

21

preference.

22

discussed at the beginning, I think it's quite clear

23

they're trying to merge these -- merge the adjustments and

24

the deductions in a way that's just logically

25

inconsistent, as well as inconsistent with the

So, in that respect, as Justice White

1

regulations.
And as far as the question about why is it that

2

3

some kinds of intangible drilling costs are added to the

4

basis of the mineral deposit, but tangible improvements

5

are not, well, there's the fact that that's the way the

6

regulations require them to be treated, but this Court

7

dealt with that issue at length in 1933 in the

8

Dakota-Montana case.

9

And the Court's explanation of the different

10

treatment was that the costs of drilling a hole in the

11

ground don't depreciate over time and have a salvage

12

value, the way that a machine or a pump does.

13

not depreciable over time in the way depreciable property

14

is.

15

hole simply adds to the value of the mineral deposit, the

16

minerals in the ground, and that that is the logical

17

reason for joining the intangible drilling costs with the

18

mineral deposit.

19

What the Court said in Dakota-Montana is that the

So, it's

MR. JONES:

1

But it certainly does explain the

2

rather stark line that the Court has recognized for 60

3

years between the separate bases of depletable and

4

depreciable property, and that's the primary relevance of

5

it for this case.
QUESTION:

6

But the taxpayer here is not

7

including the value of these depreciable properties in

8

figuring the depletion allowance.
MR. JONES:

12

13

Not in figuring the allowance per

se.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

They're just -- it's just

for figuring the tax, the -- this extra tax.
MR. JONES:

Yes, only for the purpose of

14

reducing their tax preference from depletion.

They're

15

saying that in determining the amount of the excess

16

depletion they've recovered, they should be able to set

17

off the unrecovered depreciable costs.

18

But the only way they can reach that result is

19

by showing that these unrecovered depreciable costs form

20

part of the basis of the mineral deposit, and that's where

21

their argument breaks down because the regulations and

22

this Court's decisions and the Service's rulings

23

specifically require that those accounts be kept

24

separately.

25

And the logic of the minimum tax requires that

1

they be kept separately too because, as I mentioned

2

earlier, as commentators have pointed out, if you're

3

allowed to each year set off these unrecovered depreciable

4

costs against the depletion allowance, the result is to

5

create a gaping hole in the coverage of the act and to

6

allow large amounts of excess depletion wholly to escape

7

taxation, which is precisely contrary to the objectives of

8

the minimum tax.

QUESTION:

I must say you describe the minimum

tax and the adjustments as much more rational creatures

than it seems to me they are.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

Don't they just achieve that

MR. JONES:

statute because what the statute says, what Congress said,

2

was that in deciding the amount of the preference, it's

3

simply the amount of the depletion above the basis of the

deposit.

That was their economic judgment.
QUESTION:

5

I'm not sure that the basic reason

for giving it a depletion allowance in the first place is

inconsistent with the taxpayer's position in this case.
MR. JONES:

8

9

Well, the basic reason is to provide

an incentive, and the flip side of that incentive is the

10

abuse.

And to the extent there's an abuse, the tax

11

applies, but the abuse is defined by Congress as simply

12

the amount of the depletion in excess of the adjusted

basis.
