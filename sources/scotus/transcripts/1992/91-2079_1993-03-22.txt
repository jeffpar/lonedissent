ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAREL T. HEDLUND

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MS. HEDLUND:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

12

This case involves the reasonable cost

13

methodology under the Medicare program. Under that

14

provision, the Secretary is to reimburse providers for

15

their reasonable cost of providing services to Medicare

16

beneficiaries.

17

The statute defines "reasonable costs" as those

18

costs actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of

19

incurred costs found to be unnecessary in the efficient

20

delivery of needed health services.

21

The statute requires the Secretary to do two

22

things.

23

a variety of methods to determine a provider's reasonable

24

costs in the first instance, and then in clause 2 of the

25

same section, it requires the Secretary to make suitable

The first is, it authorizes the Secretary to use

1

retroactive, corrective adjustments for individual

2

providers when the methods produce inaccurate results.

3

The issue in this case is what kind of

4

individual retroactive corrective adjustments does clause

5

2 require?
Are they adjustments to bring an individual

6
7

provider's reimbursement into line with reasonable cost as

8

it's defined in the statute -- that is, actual costs

9

excluding those due to unnecessary services or to

10

inefficiency?

11

that clause 2 requires -- or is it simply an adjustment to

12

reconcile the interim payments the provider receives

13

during the year with the amount that the methods say that

14

you get, with the Secretary's regulatory method?

15

That is the position the hospital contends

In this case, the petitioners are six rural

16

Nebraska hospitals.

17

their costs were always under the Medicare cost limit.

18

Beginning with the years under appeal, however, their

19

costs exceeded the Medicare cost limits for the first

20

time.

21

Prior to the cost years under appeal,

The hospitals still had the same necessary costs

22

that they had in prior years.

23

no findings that the hospitals operated inefficiently.

complaint that the cost limits for areas that have a high

1

percentage of part-time employment is artificially low, it

2

is set artificially low, and yet the cost limits were

3

applied in this case to disallow a substantial portion of

4

the hospitals' necessary operating costs.

5

The Secretary applies the Medicare cost limits

6

in a conclusive fashion.

That means a provider cannot be

7

reimbursed for costs in excess of the cost limits even if

8

the provider can demonstrate that the costs are reasonable

9

and necessary unless the provider's costs fall within one

10

of a very few narrow exceptions that the Secretary has

11

provided for, and in this case both parties agree there

12

were no regulatory exceptions applicable to these

13

providers.

14

In this Court, we are not challenging the

15

validity of the routine cost-limit methodology as a

16

general rule.

17

providers the reimbursement produced by the Secretary's

18

methods was inadequate under the statutory standard.

19

is, it failed to reimburse the provider's actual,

20

necessary costs, excluding those costs due to inefficiency

21

or unnecessary services, and what the hospitals are

22

seeking is the opportunity to show that their costs in

23

excess limits of the cost limits were reasonable.

We are saying that for these particular

MS. HEDLUND:

1

I believe Clause (ii) provides

that.

this case, and they say that the Secretary shall provide

4

for the making of a suitable retroactive corrective

adjustment where for a provider of services for any fiscal

period the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods

7

of determining costs proves to be inadequate or excessive.

It goes on to say later, on

11

that same page, "These adjustments are required when for a

12

provider the aggregate reimbursement produced by the

13

methods of determining costs is too high or too low."

14

The Court goes on to say, again on that page,

that "This distinction" -- it's making a distinction

QUESTION:

--

This, incidentally, is at page 210 of

the U.S. Reports.

19

MS. HEDLUND:

Thank you very much.

20

It says that Clause (ii), rather than permitting

21

modification to the cost method rules and their general

22

formulation, is intended to authorize case-by-case inquiry

23

into the accuracy of reimbursement determinations for

24

individual providers.

1

wasn't it talking about something just in the normal

2

meaning of those terms different from the methodology, and

3

isn't the suggestion given there the same suggestion that

4

is given by the three final words in the statute itself

5

which refers to the result being either inadequate or

6

excessive?

7

That isn't language which seems to call into

8

question the methodology.

It seems to be language that

9

assumes that there is a comparatively easy way of finding

10

out whether a particular resolve, a particular total, if

11

you will, is right or wrong, and if that is so, that of

12

course supports the Government's position.

13

MS. HEDLUND:

Well, I think the term inadequate

14

or excessive in the statute referred back to the first

15

sentence - -

16

QUESTION:

Well then, why didn't it refer to

17

unreasonably high or unreasonably low, because the statute

18

doesn't talk about adequacy or excessiveness, it talks

19

about reasonable cost.

20

MS. HEDLUND:

But it discusses the -- when a

21

provider's -- when the reimbursement methods do not fully

22

take into account the provider's actual, reasonable cost,

23

I think it may be helpful in this regard to go back to

24

some of the legislative history.

25

When the Medicare statute was created in 1965,

Congress said that the reasonable cost methodology was

2

intended to reimburse the actual costs of providers,

3

however widely they vary from institution to institution,

4

except where they're substantially out of line with

5

comparable institutions, and it gave the Secretary in the

6

first part of the statute --

QUESTION:

8

9

It seems to say two different things,

but I won't stop there.
MS. HEDLUND:

It gave the Secretary the

10

flexibility to use a variety of methods, including the

11

cost-limit methods, to try to get as close as possible to

12

reimbursing what a provider's actual costs were, but then

3

all the methods are subject to the overriding mandate of

4

Clause (ii) that there be an individual retroactive

5

adjustment when those methods do not satisfy the statutory

6

standard of what at that point was actual cost.

In

It put into the definition of reasonable

20

attributable to inefficiency or unnecessary services, and

21

when it added the cost-limit authority into the statute,

22

it inserted that in the third sentence of this statute,

and the third sentence is what lays out all the variety of

24

methods the Secretary could use.

All of those methods remain subject to

Clause (ii), which is an individual adjustment.

2

QUESTION:

Well, but that's the issue in the

3

case, isn't it?

Is it the methodology which is subject to

4

Clause (ii), or is the computation of results under the

5

methodology?

6

MS. HEDLUND:

7

QUESTION:

If the methodology --

I mean, simply to say that the

8

methodology is subject to Clause (ii) it seems to me is in

9

effect to assume the conclusion that you've got to reach.

10

MS. HEDLUND:

What we're saying, the test is

11

whether the individual provider's reimbursement -- not the

12

method, but the actual money that goes to the providers is

13

excessive or inadequate to meet the statutory standard.

14

QUESTION:

Right, and the question is whether

15

that adequacy or inadequacy is to be reviewed in such a

16

way that would allow a departure from the methodology, or

17

whether it is to be reviewed in such a way as to provide,

18

in effect, a final year-end computation that would correct

19

any cumulative errors from the monthly instalment

20

reimbursement.

21

MS. HEDLUND:

When Congress enacted the cost

22

limit in 1972, it very clearly says in the legislative

23

history that the cost limits were to be presumptive, and

24

that costs that could not be justified by providers would

25

not be reimbursed.
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The reason the cost limits were put into place,

1

2

Congress said, is it recognized that intermediaries were

3

having a very difficult time identifying which costs of a

4

given provider were too high and explaining why they were

5

too high, and Congress decided to shift the burden of

6

proof.

7

It gave the Secretary the authority to establish

8

cost limits that were going to be presumptive measures of

9

reasonableness, and then every provider if it felt it

10

could justify the reasonableness of its costs over the

11

limits would be able to do so.

12

QUESTION:

Now, is there any administrative

13

procedure for doing that in addition to or apart from

14

subsection -- the regulations that are mandated by

15

subsection (ii)?

16

MS. HEDLUND:

The Secretary has -- I think there

17

are mechanisms available, regulatory mechanisms available.

18

The Secretary has not implemented them to do so.

19

QUESTION:

If that is so, that undercuts your

20

argument that that is the object of subsection (2), that

21

an opportunity to litigate the inappropriateness of the

22

presumption is the object of subsection (2).

23

MS. HEDLUND:

I think actually the language of

24

the book-balancing regulations that were cited in the

25

Georgetown decision, the actual language of the
11

regulations, is broad enough to encompass the kind of

2

adjustment that we seek.

3

copy of the decision, the language of the book-balancing

4

regulation that's quoted there says that it's supposed

5

to - - the retroactive adjustment will represent the

difference between the amount received by the provider

that HHS can't meet any requirement that may exist there

23

MS. HEDLUND:

If the exception's regulations

24

perhaps had had another provision in it that it would

25

allow providers to appeal to demonstrate that their costs

over the cost limits were reasonable, for whatever reason,
that would do it, but they haven't done that.
QUESTION:

But you don't think the Secretary can

say, here are the reasons that we are going to take
account of?
MS. HEDLUND:

I don't think that satisfies the

plain language of the statute, which is for a provider for
any fiscal period.

I think any provider needs to be given

that opportunity to demonstrate that its costs are
reasonable under the statutory standard.
QUESTION:

Ms. Hedlund, you would give the

Secretary this much, wouldn't you, you would say that if
you come up with an accounting methodology, a cost
accounting methodology that shows you have been
inadequately reimbursed but the Secretary, using another
cost accounting methodology which is also reasonable,
finds that you haven't been reimbursed, and both
methodologies are perfectly respectable ones, you lose?
You won't even give him that much?
MS. HEDLUND:
QUESTION:

I'm not sure I fully understand --

Well, I mean, there are a lot of ways

to skin the cat, and economists have developed a lot of
different methodologies, and very often either one is a
reasonable methodology.

1

methodology, the mere fact that you come up with another

2

methodology, which is also reasonable, that shows you've

3

been inadequately reimbursed, that would not entitle you

4

to compensation, would it?

5

That's not involved in this case, but --

6

MS. HEDLUND:

7

QUESTION:

8

It's not.

I'm just trying to see how far you're

trying to roll over the Secretary here.
(Laughter.)

9

MS. HEDLUND:

10

I think that the statute -- we're

11

not challenging the methodology, so - - the statute says

12

when any methodology, when the aggregate reimbursement

13

produced by all the methodologies is inadequate under that

14

statutory standard --

15

QUESTION:

How are you going to prove that

16

you've been inadequately compensated without going through

17

some system of proof?
MS. HEDLUND:

19

proof.

We need to go through a system of

That's what we would like to do, and -QUESTION:

20

And then it might be quite

21

reasonable, but the Secretary's is, too, as Justice Scalia

22

suggests.

23

MS. HEDLUND:

The test of reasonableness is one

24

that's been used a very long time in Medicare.

25

from the 1965 legislative history that I said before,
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

It derives

1

which is that it's to reimburse costs however widely they

2

vary, except where they are substantially out of line with

3

costs of comparable providers.

4

And the Provider Reimbursement Review Board

5

right now hears cases all the time where the issue is, was

6

a particular cost of a provider reasonable, and the level

7

of proof the provider has to meet is to show that its

8

costs were comparable, or substantially in line with costs

9

of comparable providers, and that kind of exercise goes on

10

all the time at the Provider Reimbursement Review Board,

11

so we're not seeking some kind of new methodology by which

12

to prove that the costs are reasonable.

13

With respect to the Secretary's book-balancing

14

interpretation, if you step back and look at the structure

15

of the statute, it seems to me there are two kinds of

16

retroactive adjustment required.

17

every provider, every year, and that is the kind of

18

reconciliation the Secretary does, and we contend that

19

that reconciliation is governed by section 1395(g).

20

One is required for

1395(g) is the section that provides for interim

21

payments to providers throughout the year, and then it

22

requires that there be necessary adjustments on account of

23

overpayments or underpayments, and that those adjustments

24

should be made prior to settlement of the cost report.

25

That final adjustment that takes place prior to

1

settlement of the cost report is exactly what the

2

Secretary's book-balancing interpretation does in this

3

case.

4

and we contend that that is entirely covered under section

5

1395(g).

That's all that the Secretary says they should do,

If you look at Clause (ii) , the language of

6

7

8

for any fiscal period.

It doesn't say, every provider for

That language in Clause (ii) does not

contemplate an adjustment for every provider every year.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD C. DuMONT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. DuMONT:

9
10

Mr. Dumont,

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioners in this case were subject to exactly

11
12

the same regulatory cost limits that applied to all

13

similar Medicare providers during the years at issue.

14

Their costs exceeded those limits, and they concede that

15

they did not qualify for any of the exemptions or

16

exceptions provided in the Secretary's regulations.

17

In the courts below, petitioners challenged the

18

validity of the regulatory cost limits, saying that they

19

were arbitrary and irrational.

20

and in this Court they concede that the regulatory cost

21

limits are generally valid.

22

right to some sort of individualized proceeding in which

24

limits, although generally valid, should not apply to

25

them.

I thought it was

That's how the provision begins,

11

and that's how the provision stood in 1965 when it was

the Secretary to provide for the establishment of limits

QUESTION:

What about Clause (ii)?

MR. DuMONT:

Clause (ii) has been there since

MR. DuMONT:

In that particular language.
Yes.

The language of Clause (ii)

15

has not changed except to change B to (ii) when they

16

reordered the numbering in the statute.

17

We would --we think the petitioners focus on

18

Clause (ii), which defines reasonable cost, but as I've

19

been saying, the immediately preceding sentence of the

20

same section explicitly authorizes the Secretary first of

21

all to make estimates of the costs necessary in the

22

efficient delivery of needed health services, which is the

23

language which Ms. Hedlund refers to, and then, on the

24

basis of those estimates, to promulgate limits on the

25

costs to be recognized as reasonable.

If there's a key point in this case, it is that

1

2

when the Secretary prescribes a valid cost limit,

3

to be recognized as reasonable, that, as a matter

4

statutory authority, pretermits any further inquiry into

5

whether a the valid application of those methods produces

6

a result which is reasonable or not.

7

QUESTION:

which is
of

Well, I -- the concern, though, is

8

that here the statute spells out how the Secretary is

9

going to determine the calculation of reasonable costs,

10

but then subsection (ii), the clause on which petitioners

11

rely, says that where the aggregate reimbursement made by

12

these methods of determining reasonable cost proves to be

13

either inadequate or excessive, that some adjustment will

14

be made, and that suggests at least that it's more than

15

just going through the reasonable cost analysis.

16

the language would suggest that.

17

MR. DuMONT:

I mean,

Well, Your Honor, I think the

18

language suggests -- you know, mandates that there must be

19

some adjustment and there's going to be some comparison of

20

aggregate amounts.

21

"inadequate or excessive" at the end of the statute begs

22

the immediate question, inadequate or excessive compared

23

to what?

.

We would submit that the language,

self-defining in the statute.

2

QUESTION:

Well, there's another statutory-

3

provision, I think that requires the book-balancing, so

4

Clause (ii) must mean something else.

5

another statute, I think --

I mean, there's

6

QUESTION:

1395g.

7

QUESTION:

1395g, that says you're going to do

8

the book-balancing, so I think probably it's reasonable to

9

read subsection (ii) as requiring something more.

10

I get bogged down in what the something more

11

might be and how the Secretary could do it.

12

the Secretary can do the something more in the very way

13

the Secretary has, by providing exceptions here and there.

14

They have regulations that deal with many of these things.

15

MR. DuMONT:

I mean, maybe

Well, I certainly agree that if

16

Clause (ii) requires anything more than we say it does,

17

which is to say, year-end reconciliation, then whatever

18

obligation it imposes on the Secretary is first of all

19

qualified by the words "suitable retroactive corrective

20

adjustments" which implies a certain range of discretion,

21

and second is fully accounted for by the exceptions and

22

exemptions that the Secretary has in fact built into the

23

cost limits.

24
25

Now, I should be clear that we do not think
those exemptions or exceptions were promulgated under the

1

authority of Clause (ii) because we don't think that is

2

what Clause (ii) is about.

3

Now, with respect to section 1395g, with respect

4

I think the two statutory provisions really look at

5

different phases of the process in two ways.

6

all, section 1395g is a payment mechanism, and if you look

7

at the beginning of section 1395g, which I believe is

8

quoted on page 20 of petitioners' brief in note 17, the

9

beginning of that section is,

First of

"The Secretary shall

10

periodically determine the amount which should be paid

11

under part A to each provider of services," and so on.

12

Now that refers to something obviously as

13

outside of section 1395g itself as to the substantive

14

determination of how much is to be paid, and we submit

15

that what it refers to is the Secretary's cost

16

determination methods which are in fact specified in

17

section 1395x(v).

18

QUESTION:

Could I ask you, the Secretary has

19

determined the compensation for this provider under his

20

prescribed methodology - -

21

MR. DuMONT:

22

QUESTION:

I take it.

Now, Clause (ii)

excessiveness.

That's correct.

QUESTION:

1

Now, how would the Secretary ever go

2

about saying that what we have paid is excessive, even

3

though our methodology says that's supposed to reflect

4

cost?

5
6

7

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think that's a very

interesting question, Your Honor, and in fact -QUESTION:

It would be almost impossible,

8

wouldn't it, for the Secretary to confound his own

9

methodology?

10
11
12

13
14

MR. DuMONT:

Well, no, Your Honor, in fact I'm

not sure that it would be.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm just suggesting to you that

maybe excessiveness could only really mean book-balancing.
MR. DuMONT:

First of all, I think that is by

15

far the most natural interpretation of the statute, is

16

that that language refers to the same kind of accounting

17

comparison that we submit, the comparison of an aggregate

18

reimbursement produced by estimated methods with a total

19

final audited reimbursement produced by the same methods

20

but applied to final numbers.

21

Now, Your Honor does raise an interesting point,

22

however, which is that in the context of this particular

23

clause, what's sauce for the goose has to be sauce for the

24

gander, so that if in fact Clause 2 provides for some kind

25

of retroactive change in the methods which are applied,

1

then there's no reason why the Secretary couldn't come in

2

and say -- because as Justice Scalia said, there's a

3

variety of reasonable methods that could be applied to

4

determining costs.

5

There's no reason the Secretary couldn't come in

6

at some point and say well, you know, I know I promulgated

7

these regulations that said that X was reasonable,

but now

8

I really think that it should have been X minus 10

and I'm

9

going to apply that on a case-by-case adjudication to

10

every provider in the Medicare program with an open year,

11

and provided that those -- both X and X minus 10 are

12

reasonable within some broad unstructured definition, I

13

assume the Secretary gets away with that.

14

seems to me to directly undercut this Court's holding in

15

Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital.

16

QUESTION:

I mean, that

Mr. DuMont, what about a third

17

possibility, besides the two represented by the

18

Government's position and the petitioners' position here?

19

Clause (ii) says,

"provide for suitable

20

retroactive corrective

adjustments where the aggregate

21

reimbursement provided

by the methods of determining

22

costs" -- methods of determining costs -- "prove

23

inadequate or excessive," and if you go back earlier,

24

you'll see that it gives the -- the provision gives the

25

Secretary authority to do various things, one of which is

to provide for the determination of costs.
Then it continues,

2

"He may also provide for the

3

establishment of limits."

4

possible that this provision allows them to question the

5

determination of cost, the methodology used to determine

6

cost, but not to determine limits that have been

7

established?

9

They are different provisions.

MR. DuMONT:

8

Why can't they -- isn't it

That's correct, Your Honor, and we

would agree with you that even if Clause (ii) had

10

originally allowed for some kind of originalized challenge

11

to the determination of costs under the original statutory

12

scheme, that once Congress came in in 1972 and spoke very

13

specifically to the concept of imposing costs --

QUESTION:

Of established limits.

Can you

costs and which constitutes establishing limits?

Is it possible to decide which

Well, doesn't the limit itself refer to costs,
though?

I don't think -- it says limits on costs.
MR. DuMONT:

Well, we would submit that the cost

22

costs.

I mean, that is our position.

QUESTION:

Well, suppose -- he's imposed a limit

couldn't possibly provide for reimbursement beyond those

it could

so once you have a validly promulgated applicable limit,

we think that ends the question as to those costs.

External.
External to the standards put forth

in 1395g itself.
Secondly, because as a matter of interpretation,

6

if you look at how both 1395g and Clause (ii) were

7

implemented in the initial regulations promulgated by the

8

Secretary, it's quite clear that Clause (ii), as this

9

Court said in footnote 2, I believe, of the Georgetown

10

opinion, the language of Clause (ii) is tracked quite

11

directly by the year-end reconciliation language in the

12

initial regulations.

13

And we would submit that those regulations

14

being -- having been drafted by people who were intimately

15

involved in putting together the statute and having been

16

really discussed with the enacting Congress before they

17

were promulgated, so it was an excellent guide to the

18

original understanding of the terms of the statute were.

19

So if those regulations implement Clause (ii) in

20

a substantive provision providing for retroactive

21

reconciliation and book-balancing at the end of the year,

22

then we think that's very good evidence that that's what

23

that clause was intended to do.

but let me ask you this:

which is either inadequate or excessive is described as an

4

aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of

determining costs -- not by the methods of deciding how

6

interim reimbursement will be made, not by the methods for

7

determining payment, but by the methods of determining

8

costs.

9

the aggregate reimbursement

Doesn't that necessarily mean that the

10

inadequacy must be an inadequacy which implies that there

11

is something wrong with the method itself?
MR. DuMONT:

12

No, Your Honor, for the following

13

reason.

The language methods of determining costs in

14

Clause (ii) is fully broad enough to include the

15

application of those methods in making the estimates that

16

are made in order to make interim payments as directed by

section 1395g.

It's really the same --

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. DuMONT:

Why?

I mean, explain that to me.

Well, you need to have some basis

20

on which to make estimated payments, since the statute

21

directs that you make them at least monthly.

Now, the regulatory direction is to make those

estimates as close as possible to what the final result is

QUESTION:

even without the word "aggregate," you are talking about a

explicable on the other theory as well.

That is, if a

2

method of determining certain of your costs inflate your

3

costs, but a method of determining other ones deflate your

4

costs, you shouldn't be able to claim reimbursement.

5

can offset one excess against the other deficiency.

7

MR. DuMONT:

You
It

Well, the word is susceptible to a

8

variety of interpretations, but actually I would urge that

9

ours is the more natural, for this reason:

that because

10

you're going to have -- you know you're going to have a

11

number of interim payments which are frankly estimates,

12

and you know they're going to be somewhat inaccurate, some

13

may be high, some may be low, you're going to get to the

14

end of the year and you're going to have an aggregate

15

number you've actually paid.

16

Whereas on their theory, it seems to me what

17

they're really saying is that they're really attacking the

18

method in the sense that they're saying that the cost

19

limits as we've promulgated them are unfair to them as we

20

have placed them on a matrix of possible places you could

21

be on the cost-limit curve, and these are per diem limits,

22

so their argument applies exactly the same way to every

23

patient day of care during the entire year.

24
25

It gives you a determinate amount, and all you
have to do to aggregate anything there is to add up the

it's a much less substantial reading of the word

By the time you get to this

question?

2

without Clause (ii)?

3
4

MR. DuMONT:

I suspect that we would argue that

the Secretary would have that power.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. DuMONT:

Yes.
To return for a moment to

7

Mr. Justice Souter's question, I think it's important to

8

realize that there is a tautology involved, we think, in

9

Clause (ii), which is to say that the costs you're going

10

to compare have to be costs that are determined by the

11

Secretary's methods, and you're going to compare them to

12

some standard of reasonableness, but as we also say, the

13

standard of reasonableness is the standard that is

14

produced by the Secretary's methods.

15

Now, our interpretation accommodates that

16

tautology, because we're not talking about changing the

17

methods, we are only talking about changing the data,

18

because the data when you originally make payments are

19

estimated and provisional, and the data when you

20

eventually make final settlement are audited and correct.

21

Now, petitioners' interpretation, on the other

22

hand, really destroys that tautology because they have to

23

be in a position of saying, well, what you compare this to

24

is some general and rather amorphous statutory standard of

25

reasonableness, which first of all we think is

they prove their actual costs.

QUESTION:

MR. DuMONT:

10

There's a factual question when

Yes.
There's a much more complicated

question when they prove their reasonable costs.
QUESTION:

what it actually cost them.

And I thought, maybe (ii) says you compare what

have to show that it was unreasonably low compared to some
statutory standard of reasonableness.
Now, Ms. Hedlund has tried to reimport into that
analysis the original regulatory standard, which was
substantially out of line with the costs of other similar
providers, but frankly I don't know why she would make
that concession, because once she's outside of the
Secretary's methods, one of which is cost limits and
another one of which is the substantially-out-of-line
standard, you're really back to a completely unbounded
statutory question of whether a particular reimbursement
is reasonable within only the statutory definition.
QUESTION:

The referent of subsection (ii) that

we've been talking about is such regulations, is it not?
MR. DuMONT:
QUESTION:

It doesn't give any independent right

to simply come in and challenge the inadequacy of -- it
directs the Secretary to come up with regulations dealing
with the subject.
MR. DuMONT:

That's absolutely correct, Your

Honor, and first of all we believe that Clause (ii) has
been implemented by regulations which date back to the
initiation of the program in the limited way in which we
interpret it, and second, even if Clause (ii) means
something else from what we think it means, presumably the

only appropriate remedy is to remand to the Secretary for

the other for the payment of nurses, and each of those

made, but the aggregate of the two was -- well, let's say

that the aggregate of the two was excessive because nurses

were paid too much, they were double-paid because their

costs were factored into the facilities somehow.

Aren't you entitled under this regulation to say

the regulations have been properly applied, no, we would

not be entitled that under Clause (ii).

Now, there might very well be some general
common law recoupment power if we had double-paid for a

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

interpretation the word "aggregate" is simply superfluous

MS. HEDLUND:

I don't think it's superfluous,

because it -- you have to wait till all the regulations

8

are applied at the end of the year before Clause (ii)

It's a retroactive adjustment, and you look at

QUESTION:

But you could reach the result your

clients reached, and you could reach the results of

reimbursement without use of that word.

15

MS. HEDLUND:

Yes, I believe that's correct.

16

The Secretary indicated that his book-balancing

17

regulations should be entitled to deference because they

18

were the original regulations developed at the beginning

19

of the Medicare program, but I'd like to go back to the

20

point I made earlier, which is the language in those

21

regulations talks about an adjustment that brings

22

reimbursement into line with actual cost.

That's not what the Secretary has done in our

case, but that's what the language of the regulation said

refers to adjustment with respect to methods of

determining costs, and that is separate in the statute

from the establishment of limits on direct or indirect

costs.

Would it suffice for your purposes if you had

the power to challenge the method of determining costs but

20

not the power to challenge the establishment of limits on

the direct or indirect overall incurred costs?

22

MS. HEDLUND:
