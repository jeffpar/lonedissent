CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Larkin.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. LARKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether the

11

Constitution prohibits a district court from enhancing a

12

defendant's sentence under the sentencing guidelines if

13

the Court finds that the defendant committed perjury when

14

he testified at trial.

15

Constitution forbids a district court from applying the

16

guidelines in that manner, and we disagree.

17

The court of appeals held that the

Long before the sentencing guidelines went into

18

effect, a district court at sentencing could take into

19

account its belief that the defendant committed perjury

20

when he testified.

21

alters that long-settled rule or justifies the conclusion

22

that the Constitution now demands that a different balance

23

must be struck.

24
25

largely of the eyewitness testimony of respondent's former

3

confederates, showed that respondent was responsible for

4

purchasing powdered cocaine, manufacturing it into crack

5

cocaine, and then selling the crack.

6

at trial was simple.

7

respondent took the stand and denied everything.

Respondent's defense

As the court of appeals put it,

The district court, however, credited the

8

The Government's evidence, which consisted

Government's evidence and convicted respondent of

10

conspiracy to traffic in drugs.

11

district court found that respondent had committed perjury

12

when she testified at trial.

is at page 29 of the joint appendix.

14

At sentencing the

The district court's finding

Based on that finding, the district court

15

concluded that sentencing guidelines section 3C1.1

16

required a two-point enhancement to the base offense

17

level.
QUESTION:

18
19

Does perjury imply a finding of

willfulness?
MR. LARKIN:

20

Yes, Your Honor.

The case law

21

makes that point so that a person who perjures herself at

22

trial has willfully obstructed or attempted to obstruct

23

justice.

24
25

QUESTION:

Because he didn't say that she was

convicted of -- that she committed perjury in so many

1

words, did he?

He said she should be assessed with a

2

two-point addition for obstruction of justice by reason of

3

her trial testimony, she was untruthful at trial.

4

doesn't anywhere say that she committed perjury, did he?
MR. LARKIN:

5

He doesn't.

He

He doesn't, I think,

6

use that precise term at page 29.

7

the two point enhancement because he found that she was

8

untruthful at trial with respect to material matters in

9

this case.

10

But he does assess her

And that, we think, is a sufficient finding to

justify the enhancement under that guideline.
QUESTION:

11

I think it would be rather difficult

12

to say that it wasn't willful, given the circumstances of

13

this case.

14

MR. LARKIN:

15

QUESTION:

But -In some cases the defendant might not

16

be believed, but her testimony might not be willfully --

17

willfully.
MR. LARKIN:

18

Correct -- correct, Your Honor.

19

And I would like to make that point very clear.

It's not

20

our position that a district court either should or can

21

enhance a defendant's sentence simply because the

22

defendant was convicted after testifying.

23

court must make a finding that the defendant committed

24

perjury.

25

jury's verdict of conviction.

The district

That finding cannot be based simply on the

The court, under this guideline as under the

1

2

other guidelines that are now in place in the Federal

3

system, has the fact-finding responsibility to decide

4

whether enhancements are appropriate once the court

5

calculates the base offense level.
In making that finding, the district court is

6

7

entitled to consider all of the evidence, since both the

8

Sentencing Reform Act and the sentencing guidelines direct

9

district courts to consider all of the evidence.

But the

10

district court must make an independent finding in this

11

regard and that, we think, is an adequate response to many

12

of the concerns that otherwise might be raised about this

13

guideline.

14

The court of appeals believed that the

15

application of the guideline and the way the district

16

court conducted it rendered the guideline

17

unconstitutional.

18

that the sentence had to be set aside and the case vacated

19

and remanded.

20

The court of appeals therefore held

In the course of its ruling, the court of

21

appeals expressly rejected the contrary conclusion that

22

had been adopted by numerous other courts of appeals,

23

eight in number now, and we believe that in so doing the

24

Fourth Circuit erred.

25

Historically, the criminal law found it

1

important to allow a sentencing judge to consider a broad

2

range of information, including prior misconduct by the

3

defendant.

4

probative and so weighty that a district court at

5

sentencing was entitled to consider such evidence even in

6

the absence of a conviction.

In fact, prior misconduct was deemed so

Among the types of misconduct that a court could

7
8

consider at sentencing was the defendant's perjury at

9

trial.

0

this Court endorsed that practice.

In

978 in the case of United States v. Grayson,
The Court at the same

11

time also rejected the argument that allowing a trial

12

judge to consider his firsthand observations of the

3

defendant's perjury would amount to punishing the

4

defendant for an uncharged crime or would deter other

5

defendants from taking the stand.

6

The background principles of law against which

7

Grayson was decided are still vital today.

8

guidelines went into effect on November

9

principles were not changed.

20
21

When the
of

987, those

In fact, the Court in cases

has made clear that those principles are still valid.
For example, in the last two terms in the Payne

22

and Dawson cases, the Court has made clear that a district

23

court at sentencing is entitled to consider a broad range

24

of information.

25

Whiteside the Court has made clear the defendant's right

1

to testify does not include the right to give false

2

testimony.

3

The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and the

4

sentencing guidelines embrace those principles.

5

mentioned to Justice Kennedy, both the act and the

6

guidelines direct the district courts to consider a broad

7

range of evidence at sentencing.

8

9

As I

And in particular, the guideline they were
concerned with here today, section 3(c)1.1, directs the

10

district courts to enhance a defendant's sentence if the

11

court finds that the defendant committed perjury.

12

guideline therefore serves as the vehicle through which

13

the Sentencing Commission and, in each case, the district

14

court can implement the principle that this Court approved

15

in Grayson.

16

That

Now, the Fourth Circuit held that that guideline

17

unconstitutionally infringed on the defendant's right to

18

testify and gave several reasons.

19

reasons are sufficient.

20

appeals was troubled by the fact that section 3(c)1.1

21

classifies a defendant's false trial testimony as the

22

obstruction of justice rather than as simply one factor

23

that a district court can consider or ignore in the

24

exercise of its sentencing discretion.

25

We think none of those

To begin with, the court of

The label used to describe this factor, however,

should be immaterial because the label has no independent

2

effect.

3

means of punishing the defendant for a crime not charged

4

against him.

5

In addition, the guideline is not a disguised

A defendant who testifies perjuriously at trial

6

thereby indicates his willingness to break the law when he

7

finds it in his interest to do so.

8

shows the defendant is a greater danger to the community

9

than might otherwise be the case, and therefore in turn is

That factor therefore

10

relevant to the question of what period of incarceration

11

is necessary to incapacitate him for the protection of

12

society.

13

The court of appeals also believed that because

14

this guideline is mandatory, it amounts to the type of

15

wooden or reflex enhancement that this Court criticized in

16

Grayson.

17

district courts in every case to enhance a defendant's

18

sentence if the court found that the defendant committed

19

perjury, Grayson at the same time did not prohibit

20

Congress or the Sentencing Commission from making the

21

judgment across the board that a defendant's trial perjury

22

is an aggravating factor and should be treated as such in

23

every case.

24
25

While it is true that Grayson did not direct the

That is precisely what section 3(c)1.1 does.

There is also nothing unusual about codifying
this rule or others like it.

The sentencing guidelines

1

codify numerous sentencing factors that prior law had left

2

to the individual discretion of district court judges in

3

each case.

4

The new mandatory nature of these rules is just

5

the inevitable result of making the choice to target a

6

district court's attention to certain matters deemed

7

aggravating or mitigating and to guide the district court

8

by giving weight to those factors, instead of leaving to

9

each court in each case the authority to make that

10

decision for himself or herself.

11

however, can consider defendant's perjury at trial, and we

12

know from Grayson that it can, a district court then can

13

be channeled in the exercise of that discretion by

14

Congress or the sentencing commission.

15

If a district court,

The court of appeals also believed that, again,

16

because this guideline is mandatory, it would deter

17

innocent defendants from testifying, especially defendants

18

with prior convictions.

19

defendant who goes to trial has as his overriding concern

20

avoiding a conviction.

21

whether to testify based on his assessment of the

22

likelihood that his testimony will increase the prospects

23

of his acquittal.

24
25

We think that's unlikely.

A

A defendant therefore will decide

In making that judgment a defendant will rely on
various factors, such as the strength of the Government's

1

case, the strength of the other defense evidence

2

available, the defendant's prior record or other factors

3

that may be used to impeach him, his credibility as a

4

witness, and his ability to withstand cross-examination.

5

We think it would be a rare case in which a

6

defendant, after balancing all those factors, concludes

7

that he should testify in order to increase his chances of

8

an acquittal, but then nonetheless decides against doing

9

so because of his fear that the jury would erroneously

10

believe he is committing perjury, would therefore

11

erroneously convict him, and that the district court then

12

erroneously would make the same conclusion and enhance his

3
4

sentence under this guideline.
The Fourth Circuit expressed skepticism that the

5

district courts could or would apply this guideline

6

properly and that courts of appeals could or would police

7

the actions of the district courts.

8

be pessimistic in this regard.

9

We see no reason to

As I mentioned before, the guideline requires

20

that a defendant's sentence be enhanced if the court makes

21

the finding, independent of the jury's verdict, that the

22

defendant committed perjury.

23

therefore, has this responsibility at sentencing, like

24

many of the other responsibilities district courts now

25

have under the guidelines.

The district court,

1

We have no fear that the district courts and the

2

courts of appeals will not be able to apply this guideline

3

in the correct manner.

4

expressed no fear that district courts would misuse the

5

sentencing authority that was recognized in that case.

In fact, this Court in Grayson

In Grayson the Court recognized that a judge's

6

7

oath of office and a judge's integrity would be a

8

sufficient guarantee that district courts may not misuse

9

this factor.

We see no reason today, now, simply because

10

the guidelines are in -- in effect, to have any less

11

confidence in the ability of district courts properly to

12

conduct the sentencing proceedings than this Court did

3

back in

978.

4

I'd like to reserve the balance of --

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Larkin, what -- what do you say

6

is the level of the burden of proof to satisfy this

7

guideline?

8

some higher level than a mere preponderance.

9

examined that question?

Some -- at least one court has held that it's

MR. LARKIN:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. LARKIN:

Have you

Yes, Your Honor.
Uh-huh.
It -- it has been our position that

the preponderance standard is the correct standard.

24

Sentencing Commission also takes that view.

Kikamora.

2

In that case what in essence happened was a

3

defendant's sentence was increased from a guidelines range

4

of 30 months to up within the statutory range of about 30

5

years.

6

a situation where the increase is that great,

7

appropriate to apply a greater standard to ensure that the

8

facts are found in a proper manner.

And what the Third Circuit said was when you have

9

it would be

Now we don't have any type of increase in this

10

case that remotely approaches that one, and we have

11

rarely, rarely seen that sort of large increase in other

12

cases.

13

that it hadn't seen it in other cases, I believe, and

14

certainly no other court since then has applied that more

15

stringent standard.

if the

defendant makes a statement that's not sworn -- well,

20

suppose the defendant said everything that was said on

21

cross -- on -- on -- on -- at trial at allocution, and did

22

not take the stand at trial, could the sentence then be

23

enhanced?

24

there.

If the defendant said I didn't do it, I wasn't

believe that the defendant would have been sworn.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. LARKIN:

And --

Are you sworn for allocution?
I believe so, Your Honor.

So that

4

when the defendant expresses opinions, for example, as to

5

the quantity of drugs that would be involved in a

6

particular case, since the judge at sentencing has to make

7

findings in that regard, it would be important for the

8

district court to know that it can rely on what the

9

defendant says if the defendant is sworn.

Well, I thought so. Your Honor, but

I was just advised by my cocounsel that the defendant is
not.

If that were --

QUESTION:

All right, yeah.

5

MR. LARKIN:

-- True, the defendant were not

sworn, then the judge would know from the outset that

he would -- should take the defendant's statements with

8

far more caution.

So in that circumstance, it would

arise.

cases if the defendant loses at the suppression hearing,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT E. BEVERIDGE

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. BEVERIDGE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

5

The purpose of me being here today is to assert

6

that the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals properly decided

7

that there was a chilling effect on the Fifth Amendment

8

right to testify on one's own behalf.

9

Circuit in this instance basically said why it had a

And the Fourth

20

chilling effect, and -- when you consider all the factors

21

that are involved in determining whether a defendant

22

should testify.

23

Basically, I'm here to assert and tell you why

24

the -- or how the chilling effect takes place.

25

look at Grayson, which is the key case originally decided

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

And if you

1

on the right of the court to consider those as an

2

aggravating factor, the defendant's perjured testimony at

3

trial, you can see in there that there is a reference to

4

the case of Hummelway v. Arkansas.

5

Which basically says - - in a footnote in

6

Hummelway v. Arkansas, is that the counsel for the

7

defendant has an obligation to court -- to the court, to

8

present testimony that is true or accurate or reasonable,

9

and counsel has made an effort to determine whether or not

10

the defendant is testifying to perjurious events.
And in this instance, what we have is a case

11

12

where the burden on counsel in this instance -- and this

13

goes to the very roots of effective assistance of counsel.

14

Counsel presents testimony at trial and before your client

15

testifies you go to your client and basically say, you

16

know, these are the things that you should consider before

17

you testify.

18

And under the guideline in this instance, that

19

if it's applied with an automatic enhancement, as it was

20

in this case, for perjured testimony, you're going to have

21

to advise your client that if you take the stand and you

22

lose, effectively you're going to get a two-level

23

enhancement.

24
25

QUESTION:

What was the situation before the

guideline?

MR. BEVERIDGE:

1

Before the guidelines you would

2

advise him that the judge has discretion.

3

on the stand and you give a cock-and-bull story, the judge

4

can come up with an aggravated circumstance such as in

5

Grayson that could apply.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BEVERIDGE:

8

And if you get

But so you -Now you've reached a level of

automatic enhancement, and so you --

9

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that -- that, then, is

10

your point, that the enhancement is automatic and it

11

wasn't automatic in Grayson.
MR. BEVERIDGE:

12

13
14

Right.

So then and in

Grayson - QUESTION:

And you say -- excuse me.

You say

15

it's automatic because it follows simply from the fact of

16

testimony followed by a conviction.

17

MR. BEVERIDGE:

And in the -- in the court of

18

appeals, and if there was ever oral argument in a case

19

that had an impact on the ultimate outcome, the oral

20

argument in the Fourth Circuit, at which time the

21

Government basically stated that every guilty verdict in

MR. BEVERIDGE:

2

The -- the facts of this case

involved a finding and the question was posed as to what

4

the finding was.

5

were not specific findings such as have been recommended

6

in the Eighth and Tenth Circuits and followed where, you

know, you testified that you were not in the apartment,

there is substantial evidence on the record that you had

an apartment key, three Government agents were standing

findings such as that.
QUESTION:

12

There were no

Well, there may not have been, but

13

I'm looking at findings as you quote them in your brief

14

and the trial judge is saying the defendant denied her

15

involvement when it is clear from the evidence in the

16

case, as the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt, that

17

she was involved in the conspiracy and so on.

18

that make it reasonably clear that he's making the finding

himself?

MR. BEVERIDGE:

Doesn't

If they can -- it has been, and

that's one of the inconsistencies of the guidelines

themselves.

more than just simply finding inconsistencies.

the court in this case did was to make his own finding?

He may not have made it with the kind of tomey and detail

that some of the other circuits require, but this is a

finding of the court, it's not merely a recitation of what

the jury found, isn't it?
MR. BEVERIDGE:

6

Well, the Fourth Circuit

7

addressed this and basically says we have no reviewable

findings in this instance.

1

QUESTION:

Okay.

2

MR. BEVERIDGE:

And one of the problems exists

3

with the inconsistencies among the various circuits in

4

their treating what constitutes a finding.

5

circuit it requires a specific finding that an apartment,

6

a key, a license plate, a vehicle belonged to a specific

7

defendant, while in other circuits it basically says we

8

will look to the record and review the record as to the

9

facts, whether she went -- in this instance, whether she

Within one

10

went to Cleveland, whether she sold the crack to Mr.

11

Dickerson, so on and so forth.
And in other circuits it's basically we will

12

13

just simply rubberstamp under the clearly erroneous

14

standard, we will rubberstamp an independent finding.
QUESTION:

15

Well now, are you paraphrasing the

16

language of the courts of appeals here?

17

will rubberstamp under the clearly erroneous standard what

18

the district court has done?
MR. BEVERIDGE:

19
20

Did they say we

They would not say rubberstamp.

We will look at this and we
QUESTION:

21

Well, you should be careful, Mr.

22

Beveridge.

If you're describing a holding of a court, you

23

should not put words in the mouth of the court that

24

weren't there.

25

that's another thing.

MR. BEVERIDGE:

I'm characterizing, Your Honor.

2

And, as I -- as I indicated in this instance, the counsel

3

and the burden that is placed upon counsel for

4

self-protection purposes, it involves telling your client

5

I do not know what your -- whether you are perjuring

6

yourself, but I am telling you, basically, that if the

7

court hears your testimony and you are found guilty, then

8

you will be subjected to an automatic enhancement.

9

QUESTION:

Well now, would that be sound advice

10

in view of the position that the Government and other

11

courts of appeals have taken, that it is not automatic and

12

the mere fact that the jury finds a defendant who has

13

testified guilty does not mean it's -- it's an automatic

14

enhancement of justice, an obstruction of justice?

that position before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.

doesn't take that position here.
MR. BEVERIDGE:

The -- the problem with -- with

that is that ultimately counsel is going to have an

21

influence upon his client.

22

would have resulted, or what the Fourth Circuit found as a

potential chilling effect in this instance, that counsel

is going to advise the client that perjury could be and

will be found.

It's just possibly a question of slightly

MR. BEVERIDGE:

Well, more than an increased

degree, as we have found throughout the -- the various

circuits that have decided and basically have said that as

10

long as it's not solely based upon the jury verdict, that

11

it will be found.

12

It's a much greater degree.

QUESTION:

Well, why is that somehow greater

13

than it was under -- under Grayson, so far as the

reviewability or the ability of the trial judge to make

that sort of finding?

to take the stand, to tell that client that if he takes

you speak of in a Grayson situation where the judge has

discretion and an individual gets on and testifies and

simply gets on, does not give a cock-and-bull story, does

not go out far in left field and say that he was in

would have to empanel a jury and find -- 12 people would

perjured himself.

There's no rationality.

with -- and Judge Haney, Judge Haney in the Eighth

standards and right after that the D.C. Circuit rejected

it and said we'll -- we'll rely upon the judge's

independent subjective finding that the defendant lied.

5

We don't need any reasoning such as Judge Haney said in

Willis, United States v. Willis, and said we're not going

to use this objective standards.
And, of course, there's a dissent in U.S. v.

2

He must, number one, go ahead and make the findings and

4

MR. LARKIN:

Yes, Your Honor, a judge does not

have the discretion to refuse to enhance the sentence once

he makes the requisite finding.

QUESTION:

Does he have the discretion not to

make the finding if he's convinced that there's a fair

probability of perjury?
MR. LARKIN:

to Justice Kennedy.

5

defendant would normally not be sworn.

6

defendant normally would not be sworn at allocution.

7

One is I would like to correct an answer I gave

In

Plus, under the 1992 version of the guidelines,

11

if you look to page 248, you will see that one of the

12

comments by the Sentencing Commission gives as an example

13

of instances in which the -- the guideline could be

14

applied, quote, providing materially false information to

15

a judge or magistrate.

the allocution stage.

17

And that is - - does not exclude

And secondly, in response to Justice Stevens'

18

question, it can be the case that a false statement to a

19

police officer could lead to this enhancement.

20

you look to the same volume as the 1992 edition and again

21

to page 248, you'll see that another comment by the

22

Sentencing Commission reads as follows.

23

would be providing a materially false statement to a law

there are the qualifications, material and significant.

But with those two qualifications it could apply in that

â–  QUESTION:

6

Thank you.

I was just going to say

7

that I wonder if in the actual perjorative trial it would

have be more precise to say attempted obstruction of

successful in his attempt.

11

MR. LARKIN:

12

QUESTION:

Perhaps, Your Honor.

Thank you.

Mr. Larkin, I have one question.

Do

13

you agree with your brother that if there is an -- an

14

enhancement it must be the two-level enhancement, that

15

there's no discretion to make it a one-level enhancment?
MR. LARKIN:

16

That's right.

Within that second

level of range the district court can take into account

the concern that - -

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LARKIN:

That's where the discretion comes.
Right.

It's within a range.

up.
