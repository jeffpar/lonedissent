ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS G. LYONS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

9

MR. LYONS:

10

it please the Court:

11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may

This case started as a sort of a collection case

12

brought in this Court by Delaware against New York to

13

enforce Delaware's rights under the clear teachings of the

14

backup rule promulgated by this Court in the Texas case in

15

the mid-1960's and reaffirmed by this Court in the

16

Pennsylvania case in the early 1970's.

17

The property in question was so-called overages.

18

These occur when an issuer of securities pays a dividend

19

to its holders of record and you have a broker or some

20

other party that holds for customers or clients as a

21

holder of record, and what the issuer pays is more than

22

what the broker owes to its customers.

23

It also occurs when the brokers are paid by the

24

Depository Trust Company, which we will call the DTC,

25

which is a nominee custodian set up by a cadre of brokers

and custodian banks.
The property is owed here to unknowns.

That is

3

the agreed position of 49 of the States except for New

4

York, which says that it may be owed to knowns, but it

5

can't identify who they are at this point.

QUESTION:

Why does this occur so often and

generate so much revenue?
MR. LYONS:

It occurs,

I believe, because of the

9

activities in the securities markets, that you have an

10

issuer who's maintaining a record, you have securities

11

which are traded, and they sometimes get traded in

12

semibearer form.

13

In other words, a stock certificate comes out,

14

it is endorsed and negotiable in blank form, and it passed

15

from hand to hand, and the issuer,

16

about this.

17

someone being overpaid and someone being underpaid, and I

18

think it has to do with the volume of trading and the fact

19

that we have a stock-certificate-based trading system in

20

most areas.

21

of course, doesn't know

It pays the record, and that results in

This does not involve the primary rule.

The

22

case is narrowly drawn simply to involve the backup rule.

23

The primary rule,

24

people who are on the record but who the issuer can't

25

find, who the issuer has addresses for but has lost touch

of course,

involves lost stockholders,

with, and lost customers of brokers, and we estimate in

2

our brief - - there is no evidence in the record - - that

3

the universe of the primary rule here, the escheats, is

4

much larger than that of the backup rule.

5

What started as a collection case turned into a

6

stampede.

7

up with a position that was different from the positions

8

that were quite common between the plaintiff and the

9

defendant in this case.

10

One by one, 48 States intervened, and they came

The effect of these positions was to enlarge the

11

size of the universe that was in issue in the case.

12

property that Delaware sought was the property in the

The

3

hands of the brokers who were incorporated in Delaware.

4

The property that the intervenors sought for themselves

5

was the property in the hands of the DTC, a very

6

considerable amount of property, the property in the hands

7

of the Delaware brokers, the property in the hands of the

8

brokers incorporated elsewhere, and the property in the

9

hands of the New York custodian banks, which make a

20
21

specialty upholding securities for customers.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lyons, if we were to apply the

22

rule and the backup rule and the doctrines enunciated by

23

this Court in prior cases, does that mean Delaware would

24

prevail here?

He came close to acknowledging,

that the broker was a debtor under

State law, and he said the State law was technical and

that what we needed here was a Federal common law, and

MR. LYONS:

Then what did they do?
The sender was still the -- was

MR. LYONS:

Well, he's given the money to the

that Western Union can't keep the money, that they have to

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

You may resume, Mr.

Lyons.
MR. LYONS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Before the

break, I was making the point that State law should govern

7

who the debtor is for the purpose of characterization of

8

the backup rule.

brokers are not the issuer's agent, and the issuer is no

14

money to somebody else, and they don't know who they owe

15

it to, but the issuer is not a debtor, nor is the issuer

16

their creditor.

17

The issuer has paid the holders of

They are a debtor.

It is

To be sure, they owe the

As I was saying, the only basis for applying

18

Federal common law here is to create a rule that comes out

19

differently from the rule as it would come out under the

20

laws of all 50 of the States.

21

What we have, I think, is a change for the sake

22

of change, and a change for a purpose that was rejected in

23

the Texas case itself, where it was contended that the

24

mineral rights proceeds should go back and escheat to the

25

State of Texas because it was from Texas soil that they

1

had sprung, and the Court rejected that theory and said

2

that those properties, like the rest, would be distributed

3

under the primary rule if there was a known creditor with

4

a last-known address and otherwise under the backup rule.

5

The Master, besides making what I think is a

6

change in the rule that the debtor should be the debtor,

7

which he did not acknowledge as a change, made an

8

acknowledged change by changing the State of reference for

9

the debtor from being the State of incorporation of the

10

11

debtor to the State of principal executive office.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lyons, before -- I'm sorry, if I

12

may interrupt you, before you go on to that I just wanted

13

to ask you one question that relates to your first point.

14

The brief points out that some 44 States have

15

joined into an unclaimed property clearinghouse scheme.

16

Is there any reason to believe that that scheme could not

17

be converted readily to the Court's new rule of looking to

18

the State of the issuer rather than to the State of the

19

holder if, in fact, we follow the Master?

20

MR. LYONS:

The securities industries' brief I

21

think suggests numerous difficulties with that because of

22

the way it focuses on the operations of the brokers, and

23

they make numerous suggestions - -

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. LYONS:

Do you adopt that position?
Yes, we do adopt -- we're in
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

sympathy with their position.
It's interesting to note that the rules set down

3

in the agreement for that clearinghouse quite clearly

4

identify the holder as the debtor and the State of

5

incorporation of the holder as the State of reference - -

6

44 States signed that.

7

The Master made this change of his own accord.

8

The States that were contending for the issuer as debtor

9

at that time were contending for the State of

10

incorporation as the reference for the issuer, or for

11

whoever was the debtor.

12

There was no discovery on the merits of making the change.

13

This was a spontaneous change.

There was no discovery as to really what a

14

principal executive office was and what reference it had

15

to the productive facilities of a corporation, and it

16

appears from business publications and surveys that we

17

have quoted in our brief, not having had a chance for

18

discovery, that there is very little connection between

19

the principal executive office, which is the Master's

20

rule, and the productive activities of the corporation.

21

It's just the place where the executive officers, the top

22

brass, have their headquarters.

23

It seems to me that if the Court does not adopt

24

the issuer as debtor rule, that the change falls of its

25

own weight, because the Master placed great weight on the
12

1

fact that the 10-Q report and the 10-K report that issuers

2

of securities file contain this information, and you have

3

grievous difficulties applying the change rule once you

4

get beyond the realm of the issuer.

5

But in any event, the basis that the Master gave

6

for making the change from the State of incorporation was

7

that it was fairer because it spread the money around more

8

thoroughly.

9

on it, Delaware had too many incorporations.

10

In other words, not to put too fine a point

Let me say that no corporation is required to

11

incorporate in Delaware.

12

copyrighted.

It can be copied by another State, and some

13

of them have.

What brings corporations to Delaware is a

14

perception that it's judiciary and that it's legislature

15

function in the best interests of stockholders and in the

16

best interests of corporate management at the same time,

17

that they have a balanced approach.

18

Delaware's statute is not

The rule of the State of incorporation is a rule

19

which creates an equality of opportunity.

20

it is not that the money goes to Delaware, the money goes

21

to whatever State the debtor was incorporated in if the

22

backup rule is applicable and every State has an equal

23

opportunity to do that, and if they could equal Delaware's

24

record and the record of its Court of Chancery over the

25

200 years that it has been in existence, I think that it

(800) FOR DEPO

In other words,

1

would be a healthy thing.
There's clearly no administrative ease in the

2

3

change.

The administration, even in the context of issuer

4

as debtor, is probably more difficult, and once you get

5

beyond the area of issuer as debtor, where you do not have

6

a 10 -K and a 10-Q to serve as your pole star, then you

7

have a rule which is difficult of administration, and I

8

don't see any limiting principle in the Master's report

9

that limits the change in the rule to this situation.

10

What we have, then, is change for change's sake, I

11

believe.

12

13

I will save the rest of my time for rebuttal if
I may, Your Honor.

distributions in question widely among the States rather

2

than to New York or New York and Delaware as a

3

straightforward application of the Texas rule's command.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Why is that fairer?

I don't

understand why it's fairer to distribute it more widely.
MR. BOONE:

Well, the Master's notion was that,

7

since these are basically funds that are stuck among

8

intermediaries who have no beneficial interest in those

9

funds, it would be more equitable to return those funds to

10

the States of the issuers and benefit their citizens,

11

because they generate it, if you will, through their

12

investment, the underlying securities.

13

QUESTION:

Well, maybe we could give it to the

14

Federal Government.

Then it would -- you know, we could

15

distribute it the way all the people want it to be

16

distributed.

17
18

MR. BOONE:

Well, Your Honor, that may be - -

that would be another approach.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. BOONE:

That's another approach, I agree.
What we're asking for is that it be

currently demand.

MR. BOONE:

1

I believe it is fairer, Your Honor.

2

That's New York's position, that the Court has told New

3

York and all States 27 years ago in Texas v. New Jersey

4

that it was setting down very clear rules for establishing

5

State's rights in determining what those escheat rights

6

are and intangible obligations, and the Court reaffirmed

7

that in Pennsylvania v. New York, and refused to modify

8

even slightly the rule based on the same fairness notions

9

or factors that motivated the Master here.
QUESTION:

10

Well, I suppose Congress can

11

certainly step in and change the formula and maybe if 48

12

States are out there asking them to do it, it wouldn't be

13

too tough, would it?

14

MR. BOONE:

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

15

would suggest -- New York would suggest if there's

16

something particularly unfair in this particular context

17

about distributing or escheating these funds pursuant to

18

the existing black letter escheat rules as set down by

19

this Court, we would suggest that institutionally it would

20

be better if it were left to Congress to make those

21

changes as it did with respect to the Western Union money

22

orders.

23

But if this case were to be decided on fairness

24

grounds, I would point out that beneficial -- excuse me,

25

brokers and other financial institution intermediaries do

1

have beneficial rights in these funds, as I will

2

elaborate, because our argument proceeds -- our primary

3

rule argument, which I'd like to now focus on, proceeds

4

from the traditional understanding of the primary rule.

5

That is, you identify -- the right to escheat

6

belongs to the State of the creditor as identified on the

7

will turn to that.
The Master concluded that it was not possible to

3

apply the primary rule to two brokers, and we disagree

4

with that conclusion, and we believe that the record will

5

reflect that there is a genuine issue of material fact

6

presented by New York's theory that would warrant a remand

to allow New York to pursue additional, or discovery to

8

prove certain facts.

9

We're on a very limited record here, where the

10

Master directed that discovery would be limited to

11

exploring the general architecture and structure of the

we were not allowed to pursue more detailed discovery --

element, is that brokers' nominee float results from the

We're not asking for a presumption.

What we're

asking for, at the outset of this litigation we introduced

an affidavit of our director of audits for unclaimed

MR. BOONE:

No, Your Honor.

Under the

2

traditional understanding of the primary rule, the

3

creditor is defined as the apparent owner under debtor-

4

broker's -- or, a debtor's books, whether that debtor is a

5

record holder or an individual partnership, whatever.

6

So what would be identified from the debtor-

7

broker's books who consummated that trade to his contra

8

party, another broker, that will be reflected on the

9

debtor-broker's books, and that is --

10

QUESTION:

But it won't tell you whether the

11

creditor-broker that you say can be identified is holding

We don't know.

QUESTION:

The primary rule was

Well, we don't know, whether we

follow your theory or whether we follow the theory that

7

Delaware wants, but the fact is, we have no more reason to

8

believe that following your theory is going to result in a

9

more ultimate equity than if we simply stop where Delaware

10

would have us stop.
MR. BOONE:

11
12

Well, if -- the express purpose of

the Court's primary rule as we understand it, at least

3

heretofore, is that it be effectuated where it can, and

QUESTION:

What was the Master's position on

this argument?
MR. BOONE:

Well, the Master concluded that the

creditor is the beneficial owner, which is at variance

with the traditional understanding that the creditor is

the apparent owner, the obligee, the party entitled to

enforce payment of the debt.

said, our factual argument will decide the point, and

2

again, we're on a limited record.

3

parameters of the limited discovery did not allow probing

4

of our factual theories and contentions, and they're also

5

based on this Court - QUESTION:

6

We specifically -- the

Did you claim to the Master that if

7

you were allowed this discovery you had any hope of

8

proving that you would be closer to the real beneficial

9

owner if you were allowed to follow your statistical

10

analysis for the purposes of the primary rule?
MR. BOONE:

11

The beneficial owner has been paid.

12

It's the practice of the industry, as all of the various

13

financial institutions -- the brokers and the banks and

14

DTC -- testified in their testimony, that they pay their

15

customer, who is generally regarded as the beneficial

16

owner, although that customer may be acting for someone

17

else, which is one of the problems of trying to parse the

18

notion of beneficial ownership.
But the testimony was that the financial

19
20

institutions would pay - - do pay their customers on the

21

pay date regardless of whether the financial institution

22

itself has received all of the distribution to which it is

23

entitled from the issuer's paying agent, so the record

24

will show that the customer, the beneficial owner, is

25

paid.

1

What we're talking about are funds that are owed

2

that are lost intra brokers, essentially -- that's our

3

position -- and again, under the primary rule the creditor

4

is the apparent owner.

5

I mean, there was no exploration of attributes

6

of ownership as it has traditionally been interpreted by

7

the various States in their abandoned property acts and by

8

the uniform abandoned properties acts, and as understood

9

by the financial services industry as reflected --

10

QUESTION:

You're saying the Master just

11

misunderstood this system that goes on, because he said --

12

I thought he said that neither these - - he treated the

13

Delaware and New York entities as intermediaries who had

14

no beneficial interest in these funds, and you say he's

15

just wrong about that.

16

MR. BOONE:

Yes, I -- that's correct.

I say the

17

testimony and the record will reflect that the financial

18

institution intermediaries, if you will, the brokers

19

specifically that we're referring to here, routinely pay

20

their customers.

QUESTION:

I thought he also offered you the

opportunity -- maybe I'm wrong about this -- offered you

about who, indeed, the real owners are.

MR. BOONE:

1

We were allowed within the general

2

parameters -- I mean, our theory, in order to prove it, we

3

submit, we concede, we have to trace -- we have to have an

4

opportunity to trace the actual transactions.

5

We put in an affidavit at the very outset of

6

this litigation that demonstrated that that could be done.

7

It was based on the sampling of debtor-brokers in New

8

York, and it indicated that you could trace a particular

9

transaction from a debtor-broker and establish the

10

creditor-broker which would be in New York, would have a

11

trading address in New York, and in virtually all

12

instances that has not been refuted on this record.

13

has been some hypothecation about why that application or

14

that approach would fail.

supposed to do if you didn't have this evidence?

he found you didn't even prove that in the overwhelming

number of cases this is going to be the situation.

QUESTION:

Well -I mean, I'm not sure -- he didn't

5

even buy the fact that you had proved the generality to be

6

true, and whose fault is that?

7

MR. BOONE:

No -- the brokers testified that

8

they don't make the effort to determine -- to do the

9

tracing or to discover who the creditor is.

The debtor-

10

broker who receives the overpayment makes no effort,

11

unless it is claimed against, to demonstrate who that

12

creditor is.

in the record.

A threshold issue before the Court is which

State should escheat unclaimed securities distributions

MR. NASH:

The purposes of State debtor-creditor

Mr. Nash, what if a claim arises,

3

Getting back to the question asked a moment ago,

4

with respect to looking to Federal common law versus State

law, this Court has held in several cases that in contests

6

between States the Court looks to Federal common law and

7

does not borrow from State law.

If we were to follow the Delaware-New York
approach and allow escheat priority to be accorded the

10

locational State, be it State of incorporation or State of

11

principal executive office of the financial intermediary,

12

that would result in a grossly inequitable movement of

3
4

funds to but one or two States.
For example, under Delaware's theory, owner-

5

unknown, unclaimed interest paid by taxpayers of

6

California and California municipalities, for example, or

7

any other State, paid on municipal bonds, would be

escheated not by the State of the taxpayer but by another

State, depending solely upon the fortuity of where

15

MR. NASH:

State power over physical property

depends upon the location of the physical property.

17

power over intangible property depends upon the location

18

of the intangible property, and this Court has held in

MR. NASH:

1

No, but many States touch upon the

2

intangible property.

If you have distributions of a

3

company incorporated or principal executive office in one

4

State and the investor is in another State, and the

5

contract is entered into in a third State, all I am saying

6

is not that any State in the world can be fabricated --

7

QUESTION:

It sounds --

8

MR. NASH:

But many States have citizens who

9

touch the intangible property before the transaction is

10

completed, and each would have the power to escheat, and

11

the question before the Court is, which State should have

12

the equitable superiority.

13

QUESTION:

That sounds very much like the

14

contacts theory that was explicitly rejected in Texas v.

15

New Jersey, the kind of theory that is used in conflict of

16

laws, and we explicitly said that's a bad rule.

17

MR. NASH:

I respectfully disagree.

Texas v.

18

New Jersey rejected the situs as the location.

If

19

anything, it is the Delaware rule that the situs of the

20

property, meaning the situs of the holder, should escheat.

21

That is what was rejected in Texas v. New Jersey.
Texas v. New Jersey resolved that the State of

authority -- the equitable superiority of the right to

In 1965, the Court adopted State of

Mr. Lyons, why would stare decisis

here apply less to statutory interpretation rather than

There were some questions about the amount of
disgorgement in this case.

Let me say that the

10

disgorgement from New York would be much greater under the

rule contended for as the issuer as debtor, because under

12

that rule New York would lose the DTC moneys which are a

the New York- incorporated banks and the New York-

15

incorporated brokers.

established rules.
