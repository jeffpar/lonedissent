ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. WRIGHT:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This unusual case arose out of a dispute

12

13

concerning the proper construction of section 92 of the

14

banking laws, a provision that authorizes banks in small

15

towns to sell insurance.

16

validity of section 92.

17

pointed out that at this late date, they thought there was

18

no real question about whether section 92 remained in

19

existence.

20

No question was raised about the
In fact, the Insurance Agents

They pointed out that the Controller of the

21

Currency and the Federal Reserve Board has assumed its

22

continued existence for more than 70 years; that the

23

banking industry and the insurance industry had relied on

24

section 92; and that Congress and -- and the courts had --

25

had as well.

But the D.C. Circuit, nevertheless, held

1

that section 92 had been repealed by Congress in

9 8.

2

And that's the question presented to this Court today.

3

The dispute between the parties has necessarily

4

turned on a few phrases and some quotation marks in - - in

5

a number of documents that were written more than 70 years

6

ago.

7

those documents this morning.

8

9

And I'd like to direct the Court's attention to

But before I do so, I -- I'd like to say two
things about what I think close analysis of these

10

documents shows.

The first thing it shows is that

11

Congress did not intend to repeal section 92.

12

Circuit has issued a decision on this issue since the D.C.

The Second

3

Circuit handed down the judgment in this case.

4

Second Circuit, in - - in holding that section 92 had not

5

been repealed, stressed the clarity of the evidence

6

showing that this is not what Congress had in mind.

7

And the

And, indeed, the Insurance Agents, while they

8

are now defending the D.C. Circuit's decision that -- that

9

section 92 has been repealed, they do not claim, as I

20

understand it anyway, that Congress intended to repeal

21

section 92.

22

false impression that this case presents some sort of

23

clash between Congress's intent and -- and the text that

24

Congress enacted.

25

But I don't want to give what I think is the

The second point that I think that a close

analysis of the documents that I want to direct the

2

Court's attention to this morning shows is that in fact

3

the text of those documents supports the conclusion that

4

section 92 was not repealed.

5

to show that the only thing that's really on the Insurance

Agents' side of this dispute is some quotation marks.

And -- and I -- and I hope

QUESTION:

You -- you can't find the section in

the United States Code now, can you?
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, it -- it is -- it is true

11

that in 1952 the compilers of the United States Code

12

replaced section 92 with a statement that says omit it.

13

And -- and it's followed by an explanation that section 92

14

was repealed in -- in -- in 1918.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WRIGHT:

And who were they, the compilers?
They -- they're -- they're an

17

official body whose statements about what the law is, is

18

prima facie evidence of what the law is.

19

may, I'd like to make two points about that, since --

20

since you brought it up.

21

If I -- if I

First, the -- the 1926 edition of the U.S. Code;

22

the 1934 edition of the U.S. Code, the 1940 edition, and

23

the 1946 edition all contain section 92.

24

the -- in fact, the 1926 edition of the U.S. Code was the

25

very first edition of the U.S. Code -6

Since 1952, the Code has omitted

it.

authorities have continued to say it wasn't?
MR. WRIGHT:

After the cod -- the second point

8

I'd like to make about that is after the 1952 codifiers

decided that the prior codifiers has been wrong --

11

MR. WRIGHT:

Yeah.
And raised this issue, Congress

12

held hearings on the subject.

13

decided that it'd stayed in effect since -- since Congress

And -- and apparently

has twice, in the last 11 years, actually amended section

92.

16

makes those congressional enactments totally superfluous.

section 92 --

Of course, the holding that section 92 was repealed

QUESTION:

Yeah, but -- but it would seem to me

20

the banking authorities have any doubt about it would have

21

suggested that Congress, that they -- they enact something

22

called section 92.

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, of course, if that had ever

happened, we wouldn't be here today.

provisions are actually printed on this page of the

QUESTION:

1

When you say everything in this

2

section was -- now you're referring to section 13 of the

3

Federal Reserve?

4

MR. WRIGHT:

5

However, near the bottom of page 79 of the

Yes, Your Honor.

appendix, you'll see a paragraph that begins:

"Section

7

5202 of the revised statutes of the United States is

8

hereby amended so as to read as follows."

9

reprints section 5202, the provision we were just looking

And it then

10

at, almost exactly the way it existed before 1913, with

11

one addition.

And that addition appears on page 80a of

12

the appendix.

It's the line that begins fifth, and says

13

that liabilities incurred under the provisions of -- of

14

the Federal Reserve Act, that banks may also incur those

15

in excess of their -- of their capital.

16

This is a -- a strange provision, at least

17

today, a peculiar practice, that section 5202 was amended

18

as part of the Federal Reserve Act, right in the middle of

19

a number of other provisions amending the Federal Reserve

20

Act.

21

This appendix doesn't show it, but we've just

22

been looking at the 1913 vers -- I mean of section 13, the

23

-- section 12 of the Federal Reserve Act is right before

24

what's printed here, section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act

25

is what comes right after what's printed here, and -- and

in fact it goes 1 through 16 around this.

But at that

2

time Congress had the peculiar habit of occasionally

3

amending the revised statutes as part of an act.
I'd also like to direct the Court's attention to

the very next paragraph on -- on page 80a, a paragraph

that I think is very important.

15

authority over the rediscounting practices of Federal

provision of the banking statutes.

19

Another thing about this provision is that it

It says it's an act to

Now, that title doesn't have controlling

10

authority, but as we pointed out in more detail in our

11

brief, the practice at that time was that Congress had two

kinds of titles.

One was a descriptive title, you know,

like that.

where there is some disagreement.

Now, I'd like to -- I'd like to focus again on

4

paragraph number 8, which is at the bottom of page 70a.

6

That's the paragraph I was looking at just a minute ago.

7

It is almost identical -- it's the rediscounting paragraph

19

This

Now, the argument to the contrary relies on - -

20

on these quotation marks that you'll see if you look

21

closely at -- at the 1916 amendments.

22

following that introductory phrase about section 5202 of

23

the revised statute's being amended, there's a colon, and

24

then there are some open quotation marks.

quotation marks appear again until after the paragraph

MR. WRIGHT:

Yes, Your Honor.

"This act," in that next paragraph, on the other

of the Federal Reserve Act, in our view.

12

Now, let me say that there -- there -- Congress

actually took note of the quotation marks that are the

this is detailed in the lodging that was filed by the bank

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. KAPPLER:

4
5

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
The Petitioners assert that law exists which

6

7

permits national banks to sell insurance in small towns.

8

Now, as Justice White pointed out, that law cannot be

9

found in the U.S. Code, in the current version of the U.S.

10

Code.

11

law is in force.

12

That creates a statutory presumption that no such

Well, may I ask you.

Do you think

statute was enacted?

16
17
18

MS. KAPPLER:

No, Your Honor, I do not think

they have any bearing, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, then, shouldn't we look at the

19

U.S. Code for the period right after the enactment, rather

20

than today?

21

MS. KAPPLER:

No, Your Honor.

The statutory

22

provision expressly states that it's the current version

23

of the Code that creates prima facie evidence of what law

24

is in force today.

This had to do with the non-banking powers of
just national banks, not Federal Reserve Banks at all.
Now, the fact of the matter is, when Congress
enacted this law, section 92, it evidently didn't want to
just write a new law -- propose a separate bill, but

7

wanted to propose it as an amendment to a bill that was

8

already in front of it.

9

QUESTION:

You may be right that -- that

20

paragraph 9 might have some connection with liabilities,

21

but paragraph 8 has no relevance to what 5202 deals with.

That is, the opening and closing

Now, the fact of the matter is, neither our

interpretation of the statute, which would group all three

8

not particularly sensible with those two paragraphs

surrounding 92.

But neither is Petitioners' argument.

10

And you'll notice in their half an hour of argument, they

11

made absolutely no attempt to justify why Congress would

12

have put a provision allowing national banks to sell

13

insurance together with the rest of this Federal Reserve

14

Act.

15

If the Court is going to engage in cutting and

That's correct, Your Honor.

And do you concede that the Court of

Appeals, nonetheless, had jurisdiction and power to reach

I think there's no question that

QUESTION:

It would be a rather strange doctrine

if this Court accept only the arguments of one side or the

arguments of the other, and couldn't possibly think the

It would be an odd game of sorts, yes.

In

happened in

9 6 was that section 92 appeared twice.

It

appears in the Federal Reserve Act and it appears in the

10

everything that's most relevant had happened, at the end

11

of the day, the Senate published another collection of the

12

banking laws.

It was also compiled by the Controller.

The Controller thought that section 92 was still

in existence, and it was still in existence in only one

place, in section

Justice Souter said, one explanation -- in fact, the

7

explanation that flows most logically from the D.C.

8

Circuit's reasoning is that Congress may well have thought

9

that two versions of - - two versions of section 92 were

one too many, and it cured that in

21

there was one and only one version of section 92 and it

was located in the Federal Reserve Act, until 926, when

the first compilers of the U.S. Code moved it to

have been ineffective in enacting its intent?

that that is theoretically possible?

MR. WRIGHT:

I mean,

There is certainly one reading of

intended - -

8

Congress simply failed to enact what it meant to enact?

9

That that is a possibility -- that is possible,

MR. WRIGHT:

That is possible.

And -- and the

12

confusion is illustrated by that 1917 compilation I was

13

just referring to which showed section 92 twice.

14

15

has assumed that -- everyone has operated on the

16

assumption that section 92 is in existence.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, what about those other

18

sections, other than 92?

19

roughly what paragraph 9 is on 71a?
