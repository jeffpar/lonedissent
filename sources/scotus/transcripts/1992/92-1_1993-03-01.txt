CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 92-1, Lynwood Moreau v. Johnny Klevenhagen.
Mr. Leibig.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL LEIBIG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LEIBIG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The concern before the Court today involves the

11

precise rules under which a state or local employer may

12

reach agreements to substitute time off for cash overtime

13

with their employees.

14

section 207(o) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and

15

regulations issued under that section.

16

It involves the interpretation of

It is important that, under the usual rules, to

17

realize that the Fair Labor Standards Act makes non-cash

18

payment for overtime work illegal completely.

19

has, and there is a reason for this.

20

President Roosevelt first sent a message to Congress about

21

the Fair Labor Standards Act he emphasized that one of the

22

main purposes was to protect the unorganized and to

23

establish an hours of work rule.

24
25

It always

In 1937 when

It might seem that the comp time rule, or the
cash overtime rule, isn't directly related to the overtime

1

rules, but it is.

2

because other schemes that were in existence widely in the

3

United States before 1937, for instance paying for

4

overtime in script or paying for overtime in time off or

5

comp time are easily manipulated to avoid the 40-hour-a-

6

week work rule.

7

Standards Act itself, prior to the 1985 amendments which

8

adjusted the act to the public sector, always outlawed

9

compensatory time as a means of paying for overtime work.

10

The reason cash overtime is required is

And that's the reason that the Fair Labor

In the 1985 amendments, after this Court's

11

decision in Garcia, Congress responded a request from

12

state and local governments to lighten the burdens that

13

the Fair Labor Standards Act without a special statute

14

would place on state and local government, and made a

15

number of changes in the acts in specific response to

16

pleas by state and local governments and their employees

17

that special adjustments be made to recognize the special

18

status of the states.

19

pleas, and section 2 of the 1985 amendments allowed the

20

use of comp time and also changed the rules with regard to

21

volunteers and a number of other rules with regard to

22

joint employment.

23

The states were effective in those

Part of the amendments, section 6, expressly

24

directed the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations

25

interpreting and implementing the 1985 amendments.

It is

1

our argument that section 207(o) that deals with

2

compensatory time and the conditions under which a public

3

employer may use compensatory time that is not otherwise

4

available, and are laid out in 207(o) (2) (A), require an

5

agreement.
And the issue that the Court needs to address

6

7

today are the precise conditions under which an agreement

8

needs to be reached.
QUESTION:

9

There are a couple -Speaking of the Secretary of Labor,

10

Mr. Leibig, why isn't he here?

11

12

MR. LEIBIG:

QUESTION:

14
15

Do we know that or do you

Why isn't the Secretary of Labor?
Yes.

I mean, why hasn't the

Government expressed any view in this case?
MR. LEIBIG:

Your Honor, I'm not sure

16

completely.

I'm not -- I wouldn't be surprised if it had

17

something to do with the fact that the briefs in this case

18

were due almost immediately after the election in which

19

the administration changed.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LEIBIG:

I see.
And I think that relates directly

22

to one of the arguments I want to make which has to do

23

with why regulations, when there's a statute -- the way

24

the Fair Labor Standards Act works generally is that it's

25

an administrative act which is very dependent on the

1

regulations not only for the use of comp time but across

2

the board.

3

portions of the act that are in regulations are in the

4

Executive Branch, given to the Executive Branch by

5

Congress, I think, partly specifically because of the

6

increased flexibility that that allows over if they were

7

in the statute themselves.

8

9

And one of the flexibilities in the act, the

And I think the increased flexibility has been
demonstrated particularly under the 1985 amendments.

Not

10

only did Congress make new amendments, but since then on

11

issues in which the states have been particularly

12

concerned they have gone to the Department of Labor and

13

got adjustments to the regulations.

14

which is a Ninth Circuit case dealing with who is exempt

15

and who is not, that case was appealed to the Court and

16

the Court denied cert.

17

local governments went to the Department of Labor and the

18

Department of Labor changed the rules with regard to

19

exemption specifically to recognize the special needs of

20

state and local government.

21

reasons that it's wise under the Fair Labor Standards Act

22

to have regulations dealing with this kind of an issue.

In the Abshire case,

But at the same time state and

And that shows one of the

23

I want to emphasize that Congress was

24

unmistakably clear that states, as states, are covered by

25

the Fair Labor Standards Act.

Secondly, the 1985 amendments make it absolutely

clear that the state function,

and the relationship between personnel functions and the

payment of overtime, is also specifically and clearly

regulated by the statute.

9

that is personnel functions

The question that I think the statute is

10

ambiguous about is whether or not - - it is also clear that

11

the statute requires an agreement prior to an employer

using compensatory time.

representative to deal with the employer, must an

agreement be reached with the representative prior to the

QUESTION:

Where the ambiguity lies is,

And I think

Is that ambiguity solved by the

19

Department of Labor's reg, the one that, well,

whether employees have a representative for purposes of

the middle of sentences before it and after it which

address one of the direct questions in this case.

7

question asked in which the reference to state law was

made was in a state that has - - do you mean that you only

11

that, our regulations don't say that, but we do believe

12

that to determine who the representative is in a given

13

state there may be a reference to state law.

14

And the preamble says no, we didn't mean

QUESTION:

But isn't it also to be read by

saying to determine whether there is a representative for

the purposes of subsection 1 you look to state law?

19

history took?

20

MR. LEIBIG:

In

I think there are two questions

21

there, Your Honor.

The first is the difference between

22

the Senate and the House report.

If I could hold that for

23

a minute I will comment on that.

The other question about

24

whether you look for state law, I do think you look to

state law to determine whether or not there's a

representative, but when you look to state law you do not

2

look merely to state collective bargaining law.

3

words you're not just looking to state law to see whether

4

or not there's a collective bargaining statute or not.

5

you were, the wording in the statute would be much simpler

6

than it is now.

7

other than collective bargaining, which even little (i)(1)

8

refers to.

9

In other

If

It would not refer to all the things

So that you do look to state law, but you look

10

for such things as if there is state law providing for

11

collective bargaining, then state law requires exclusive

12

representation and requires that unilateral changes can't

13

be made on any wage-hour working condition without dealing

14

with that representative.

16

in those states there are all sorts of other models in

place for different types of employees.

18

That model, the National Labor

Most states have different types of models

19

ranging from a meet and confer model, where you have to

20

meet but you don't have to agree, to having a situation in

21

Texas where there's a Texas state statute that says

22

employees can have a representative, but the

23

representatives don't have the rights to collective

24

bargaining agreements.

1

and I want to make clear this is the preamble to the

2

regulation, so you've got to go to, it's a long drive from

3

the statute to the preamble, but the preamble to the

4

regulations I think are trying to say if two people show

5

up or three people show up and say they're the

6

representative, you look to state law, it might be agency

7

law, it might be all sorts of law in the state.
QUESTION:

8

9

Why don't you just as readily look to

state law to determine what the significance of the

10

designation of the representative is in states which do

11

not allow collective bargaining agreements?
MR. LEIBIG:

12

Because under the preamble, under

13

that set reference in the preamble, which is the only

14

reference to state law in this area anyway, if you read

15

the whole paragraph it starts off by somebody asking

16

exactly that question, do you look to state law to find

17

out whether a collective bargaining representative can

18

enter in full agreements.

19

Department of Labor in the preamble gave is no.

20

the clear answer in the - - the plain meaning of the

21

regulations themselves contain a clear statement that the

22

representative -- what matters is the designation of the

23

employees, not the recognition of the employer.

petitioners that the House report may support that, but

15

what about the Senate report.

16

that is if you look with rigor at the House and Senate

QUESTION:

Mr. Leibig, you argue basically that

5

the statute is ambiguous and we ought to refer to a

regulation?

MR. LEIBIG:

QUESTION:

That's right.
Do you think we have to take into

account the case of Gregory against Ashcroft in

10

interpreting this statute?

11

state function to determine whether the state is going to

12

negotiate over overtime and whether the state must pay it.

13

And true, the statute does contemplate that states will be

14

subject to it, but perhaps it doesn't contemplate it in

15

the fashion you suggest.

16

against Ashcroft we might come to a different conclusion,

17

do you suppose?

18

MR. LEIBIG:

Certainly it is a traditional

And if we look to Gregory

No, Your Honor, I don't think if

19

you look to Gregory v. Ashcroft you would come to a

20

different conclusion, for this reason.

21

think on its face Gregory speaks of interfering with the

22

usual state and local functions, and it does not, it seems

23

to refer to the question of coverage.

24

Congress has to be clear about coverage.

25

just coverage of the states as states, but also coverage

First of all, I

The conference

I grant it, not

1

of the function of the state that is being regulated.
Everybody agrees that this statute regulates the

2

3

use of comp time by state and local employees.

4

question that the statute is ambiguous about is how do you

5

arrange comp time agreements.

6

to Gregory, Congress expressly says in the statute, there

7

is an express delegation to regulations, and the

8

regulations do this.

9

The

In the statute, if you look

Now, the reason I think -- it's really the

10

interchange between Chevron and Gregory, and how do you

11

read those together.

12

think that there are precedent I can cite to say how you

13

read the two together.

14

situation.

15

And I don't think the Court, I don't

I think that's a real challenging

I do think, though, if Gregory meant to abandon

16

Chevron we are launched on a very dangerous course

17

because, for example in the Report on Intergovernmental

18

Relations that was submitted by the amici it lists a great

19

number of statutes, 32 statutes, I believe, passed before

20

1981 that regulate state and local functions, and most of

21

those statutes rely on regulations.

22

Standards Act will not work without its regulations, not

23

just on the comp time issue, but it wouldn't work on many

24

issues, and Congress knew that.

25

first point.

The Fair Labor

So I think that's the

1

The second point is I do think, and there has

2

been a number of law review commentary on the importance

3

of increased rigor for Chevron, at least when it interacts

4

with Gregory, but some would say generally.

5

that you are a literalist or a strict constructionist in a

6

general sense, that's strictly looking at the words and

7

meanings of the statutes, then you should also be quite

8

rigorous about Chevron, and I recognize that.

9

Therefore --

10

QUESTION:

To the degree

Well, if you just look at the terms

11

of the statute in the absence of the regulation, doesn't

12

it appear to say that if employees aren't covered by

13

subclause (i) then an agreement between the agency and the

14

employee will govern, in effect?

15

MR. LEIBIG:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. LEIBIG:

Subclause (i) in the first -I mean, that's what it says.
Subclause (ii) in the first

18

prepositional phrase says in the case of employees not

19

covered by subclause 1, granted.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LEIBIG:

Yes.
The problem is subclause 1 has a

22

list of types of agreements, not types of employees.

23

Subclause 1 -- and that's where the ambiguity lies.

24

don't think you can get to where I want to get by reading

25

the statute alone, but you cannot also get to where the

other side wants to get by reading the statute.

2

why it's ambiguous.

3

QUESTION:

That's

Well, it seems to me you can get

4

pretty far by just looking at the terms of the statute.

5

Perhaps the regulation simply isn't permitted.

6

MR. LEIBIG:

Let's do that for a minute.

If you

7

just read the terms of the statute you get a situation, as

8

read by Harris County, you get a situation where the

9

statute would then say if you want an agreement you need a

10

collective bargaining agreement, a memorandum of

11

understanding, any other form of agreement, an agreement

12

with individuals, or an agreement with individual

13

employees.

14

agreement you have.

15

need section 2(A) at all because you could have just said

16

the employer can have comp time whenever they want to

17

because all they have to do is refuse every agreement and

18

they are automatically in a place where they can impose,

19

as Harris County did as a condition of employment, comp

20

time.

21
22

23

That basically covers every possible type of
If that's what this means, you didn't

So if that's what Congress meant, first of all
they didn't need any of these words.
QUESTION:

Well, but realistically the employer

24

is not in a position to refuse every collective bargaining

25

agreement that's pressed upon it.

I mean, you're quite

right that they could get there by simply refusing every

agreement, but realistically that's not an available

option.

Congress wanted to say that they could have.

how state law sets up rights of representation.
I would emphasize in Texas there isn't a

collective bargaining statute, but there is a statute that

says public employees can deal with their employer through

More than that, what this -- these words are

MR. LEIBIG:

I think so, and I think the way you

The critical phrase is employees not

MR. LEIBIG:

That wouldn't be logical for a

number -- the first reason it wouldn't be logical is

because if you play that out what that would mean,

Congress wouldn't have needed all these words to say that.

That's one of them.

the overall structure of the 1 85 amendments that doesn't

make sense, as we explain in the brief.

The second reason is if you look at

But more

importantly, if you look at the structure of the Fair
10

Labor Standards Act as a whole it wouldn't make sense

11

because it would vest employers with the possibility of

12

doing, it was exactly happened in Texas, that is

completely abrogate the need for any agreement at all

because comp time can be imposed as a condition of

No.

What I urge on you is the

reasonable for it to mean what you described earlier.

If

you do not have -- if (i) only applies to where there are

collective bargaining, if there was a collective

petitioner would argue they can use comp time, even though

under state law they would not ordinarily be able to use

that is Congress imposing on states that chose to have

1

2

3

meaning of the statute is clear, and no part of subsection
(o) is rendered superfluous.
The plain meaning of paragraph 2 is that a

4

public agency may provide compensatory time only pursuant

5

to, one, an agreement between the public agency and

6

representative of the employees, or, two, pursuant to an

7

agreement between the employer and the employer.

8

note that in Harris County this is exactly what has

9

occurred, as each Harris County employee, as each one of

10

the petitioners has stepped up to accept employment they

11

have signed this individual form that Mr. Leibig mentioned

12

and have agreed to the terms.

QUESTION:

And I

Well, Mr. Streicher, do you take the

14

position that if there, in a state where there is a

collective bargaining agreement but the agreement does not

allow, it just doesn't cover comp time, now, do you think

17

in such a state that the county would be able to enter an

An individual employee to cover it?

20

MR. STREICHER:

Justice O'Connor, I don't know

21

that one would need to go to that particular state's law

MR. STREICHER:

Yes, Justice Kennedy, I believe

it would, there being no agreement in Justice O'Connor's

scenario, then under subpart (i), then one would go, one

would be authorized to go to subpart 2.

there is no such agreement then one would go to subpart 2.

3

QUESTION:

But it's not clear that there's such

talks about agreement with reference to compensatory time.
MR. STREICHER:

I perhaps don't understand your

question, Justice Kennedy.

8

reached between the representative in those states that

9

recognize a representative, and that one can meet and

10

confer with that representative, then one would go to

11

subpart 2.

12

QUESTION:

But if there is no agreement

Well, I certainly think some

13

employers could argue that single (i) controls, that there

14

is an applicable provision, it just says nothing about it.

15

I think that's a plausible construction.

16

MR. STREICHER:

One would have to go to the

17

state law to determine the result of that answer, and in

18

Texas, as we have stated in our Reply Brief and our

19

Appendix, in Texas we cannot recognize a representative.

20

It is against public policy.

21

QUESTION:

Well, we're talking about two

22

different things.

We're talking about the meaning of the

23

statute in the context of the hypothetical agreement we

24

have outlined, and then there's also the question of

25

whether or not an employee is authorized to conclude it.

to look at Texas law for little (i) as to whether you have

6

state law prohibits individual agreements apart from the

then you cannot have an agreement or understanding arrived

I mean, if

Is that your position?

MR. STREICHER:

QUESTION:

MR. STREICHER:

No.

another state that has public employee unions and that

MR. STREICHER:

If that was the effect of that

I'd like to continue then on that particular

the Garcia decision was handed down.

10

And for that proposition I point you

Properly understood in light of this

11

congressional purpose to preserve existing compensatory

time practices, it's hard to imagine how Congress could

have improved upon the statutory language that was

actually chosen in section 207(o).

QUESTION:

Is it your position that the employer

may on his own substitute comp time for overtime even if

he doesn't deal with individual employees?

2 apply, because those employees would not be permitted to

MR. STREICHER:

I don't believe, Justice

6

Stevens, that subpart 2 could apply because in section,

7

subsection (o), subpart (B) it talks about existing

8

collective bargaining agreements, and if the existing

9

collective bargaining agreement were one wherein no

10

compensatory time was allowed, then that collective

11

bargaining agreement would have been entered into pursuant

12

to subpart 1, and that would be the relationship between

that employer and those employees.

Secretary of Labor himself that whether or not an employee

That doesn't strike me as very sensible.
MR. STREICHER:

I agree with you, Justice

Scalia, certainly that it was the intent of Congress to

QUESTION:

Mr. Streicher, there has been some

colloquy between the bench and you and your opponent about

the provisions of a regulation and there has been

reference made to something on page 34a of the Appendix

that apparently is the reaction of the Department of Labor

to requests for comment on a rule.

paragraph on page 34a that carries over to 35a it says the

reflects the statutory requirement that a collective

you have to deal with the representative.

for that is to encourage voluntariness of the agreements.

As a matter of Texas law employees

can designate a representative --

the employees in this case would be covered by, they are
