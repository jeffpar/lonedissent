15

any relationship to the facts framed here.

16

They have adopted a case of this

But having committed that mistake, the Tenth

17

Circuit has compounded that error by misreading the Ron

18

Pair decision so as to require the petitioners to pay

interest not only on an arrearage in a Chapter 13 plan,

20

bankruptcy plan, but also with respect to fees, costs, and

21

other charges.

of the Tenth Circuit opinion.

And that is found in the final paragraph

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Justice White, as I am.

3

This -- the statutory provision, section 506(b), requires

4

that where a claim is oversecured the allowed secured

5

claim must be paid interest and must also be paid its

contractually provided for fees, costs, and other charges.

We feel that section 506(b), however, does not apply in

Justice Scalia, and that is -- that is a valid point.

you will.

Can I ask -- it seems to me that the

effecting a cure under section 1322(b)(5), the debtors

maintained payments there is a continuation of the

QUESTION:

And therefore that
It is only the

Well, it -- I'm -- let me begin with

1325, anyway.

1325 provides that you give current value,

and you make sure that current value isn't diminished as

11

of the claim covered by the plan, distributed under the

plan.

MR. CARPENTER:

QUESTION:

That is correct, Justice Scalia.

And you were arguing, at least at one

point in your -- in your brief, that this is not a claim

exists on its own as a simple contractual obligation

MR. CARPENTER:

You're saying it's a claim that

Yes.

Yes, Justice Scalia.

There's authority to that effect among the circuits.

QUESTION:

Well --

22

MR. CARPENTER:

However, it is my position that

23

section 1325 is not even invoked when a cure under section

25

payments implies with it necessary contractual payment of

QUESTION:

If that is so, how do you explain the

3

language of 1328, which says that "The court shall grant

4

the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the

5

plan," okay,

6

1322(b)(5)."

7

"provided for by the plan."

8
9

"except any debt provided for under
So 1328 refers to 1322(b)(5) as a debt

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Justice Scalia, it does.

And I believe that that -- I think the congressional

10

intent there is to -- and I don't want to particularly get

11

hung up on the phrase "provided for by the plan" --

12
13
-

interest on the allowed secured claim.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I do.

It seems to me central

to the -- to the case.
MR. CARPENTER:

My belief is that Congress, in

15

section 1328, indicated that where there will be a -- a

16

continuation of a long-term debt past the end of the plan,

17

it would be inappropriate, whether secure or unsecured,

18

to -- to allow a discharge.

19

1328 does refer to provision by the plan under 1322(b)(5).

20

QUESTION:

I will -- I will concede that

Do you have some interpretation of

21

that language, of 1328, that is consistent with your

22

argument here?

23

MR. CARPENTER:

No, Justice -- Mr. Chief

24

Justice, I do not.

25

"provided for by the plan," however, still does not

I believe that -- that the term

necessarily invoke the provisions of section 1325, because

2

maintenance of the payments under 1322(b)(5) will

necessarily require maintenance of the existing prefiling

contractual rate of interest that would be paid on - - on

the allowed secured claim.

10

-

QUESTION:

So then you feel that 1325 may be

inconsistent with that part of 1328.
MR. CARPENTER:

To that extent I do believe it

is, Your Honor.
Specifically, I would like to draw the Court's

11

attention to the meaning of the word cure.

12

in various places throughout the Bankruptcy Code.

13

found in section 365 dealing with executory contracts and

14

unexpired leases.

15

dealing with prepetition defaults and various types of

16

claims or interests.

17

It is

It is also found in section 1124

It is found in two places in section 1322, one

18

in paragraph (b)(3) and one in paragraph (b)(5).

19

of course, refers to debts that would mature subsequent to

20

the final payment under a Chapter 13 plan, which leaves

21

(b)(3), a fortiori, to apply, although not -- so limited

22

by its terms, it would not have any meaning apart from

23

relating only to a short-term debt, one that would

24

normally mature within the scope of the Chapter 13 plan.

25

(B)(5),

The provisions in section 365 and 1124 that deal

Cure is found

1

with cure both require the debtor, as a function of cure

2

under those sections, to not only cure the default, but to

3

compensate the claimant for any monetary loss and to

4

assure future performance under the cured default.
That language is conspicuously absent from the

5
6

two provisions in section 1322.

7

of compensation, no requirement of assurance.

8

merely either the curing or waiving of a default under

9

section 1322(b)(3), or the curing of the default under

10
11

t.

There is no requirement

(b) (5) .
We feel that Congress' intentional elimination

12

of the compensation and assurance language found in 365

13

and 1124 indicate clearly that the time value money, which

14

would equate to the compensation factor in 365 and 1124,

15

are specifically to be disregarded under cures either

16

under section 1322(b)(3) or (b)(5).

17

There's additional language in the section

18

1322(b)(5) that specifically requires the cure to be

19

effected within a, quote, reasonable time.

20

as I indicated, further elaborated in the Code, but is

21

nonetheless, I believe, Congress' intention that the

22

bankruptcy court, which is, in the best of all possible

23

circumstances, on a case-by-case basis, to make a factual

24

determination of what should constitute a reasonable time.

25

That is not,

That, I believe, is consistent with the

1

framework of the Bankruptcy Code in general and harmonizes

2

all of the apparently and superficially conflicting

3

sections of the Bankruptcy Code in Chapter 13.

4

there are various competing interests, the mortgagee has

5

an interest and that competes with the interests of the

6

debtor.

7

But since

But more importantly, and perhaps more to the

8

point, the general unsecured creditors have a very

9

distinct interest in whether or not interest must be paid

10

in curing arrearages.

The general unsecured creditors

11

essentially get whatever's left over at the end of a

12

Chapter 13 plan unless the Chapter 13 debtor is so well

13

heeled that he may fully fund the plan, notwithstanding

14

what objections might be raised, and pay unsecured

15

creditors 100 percent of their face amount of their

16

claims.

17

In those fairly rare instances - - I do note, by

18

the way, that petitioners Yell are in a 100 percent plan.

19

But in those fairly rare instances, if interest is

20

required to be paid, then that interest is going to be

21

essentially borne on the backs of the general unsecured

22

creditors.

23

Chapter 13 plan would be confirmed, I think the interests

24

of the general unsecured creditors are being preserved by

25

the bankruptcy court in allowing a cure without interest.

Since they have no vote in whether or not a

I think that section 506(b) does not apply to
the case before the court today, for the reason that I
believe section 506(b) is a general statute, one of
general application.

In fact, that has been a

determination found by the Third Circuit in the case of
Wilson v. Commonwealth Mortgage Corporation, found at
895 Federal Reporter, Second Series, at page 128.
Chapter 5, along with chapters 1 and 2, tend to,
if you will, float over the entire administration of a
bankruptcy proceeding to provide a general administrative
guidance, and is to give way where there are specific
instances of apparent conflict between Chapter 5 and, in
this case, Chapter 13.

In any event, I would note that

there is no language in section 506 which would tend to
determine anything relative to what is necessary under a
cure.
I would like to point out that the -- of course,
the position of the petitioners is supported by the
majority of the circuits that have ruled on this issue, as
well as the leading treatise in the bankruptcy field, that
of Collier's, and, to the view of the petitioners, is the
only way to harmonize all of the various competing
sections in Chapter 13.
We feel that the respondent's view cannot
harmonize both 506(b) and 1325 with the nonmodification

rule of section 1322(b)(2).

respondent is seeking here to expand his contractual

3

rights in a way that is not authorized under section

4

1322(b) (2) .

5

We also feel that the

The respondent's own contract is a form drawn up

6

by his assignor for the purpose of determining the

7

relative rights of the parties at its inception.

8

specifically dealt with the issue of default and

9

delinquency by providing for late payment penalties.

It

We

10

feel that this amounts to a private remedy, and is -- if

11

section 506(b) does apply, is the functional equivalent to

12

the interest requirement under section 506(b).

13

We have a very strong feeling that the Tenth

14

Circuit opinion has skewed inappropriately the very

15

delicate balance struck by Congress in dealing with the

16

competing interests that I've previously mentioned.

17

The home mortgage contract, by and large in this

18

country, is a contract of adhesion.

19

have virtually no power to effect change in the language

20

drawn up by the mortgagee on its form contract.

21

mortgagee has the ability to protect itself from the

22

application of section 1322(b)(2) by merely requiring that

23

delinquent installments shall continue to bear interest at

24

a specified rate or at the contract rate, until paid.

25

That is not what was done.

bear with it a penalty of either $5 or 5 percent of the

And would you say that if they

adopted such a provision and such a provision provided for

would otherwise apply under the Bankruptcy Code was less

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
This case considers the availability of interest

15

for oversecured creditors in Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases.

16

In our view, the problem is resolved by the precise

17

wording of three related statutory provisions, sections

18

506(b), 1322(b)(5), and 1325(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.

19

I'd like to look first at the language of the

20

statute and then address a number of points raised by

21

petitioner.

22

interest is available, what I'll call preconfirmation

23

interest, from the date the petition is filed until the

24

effective date of the plan.

But looking at the preconfirmation interest, the

2

relevant statute is section 506(b), and this is on page la

of an oversecured claim interest on such claim; it states

that without qualification.

The first operative clause of that

As the Court explained in Ron Pair, this section

8

should be read as having two different clauses.

provides for interest in all cases and the second clause,

10

after the comma, provides for reasonable fees, costs, and

11

charges, but only to the extent that they're provided for

12

under the agreement under which the claim arose.

13

this case involves a claim for interest.

14

bankruptcy courts should have allowed the claim for

15

interest without regard to the terms of the agreement

16

under which the claim arose.

Therefore, the

2

both agree, is really the important monetary aspect of the

And what it says is "with respect to each

In this case, it's acknowledged that the claim

10

is an allowed secured claim, and it seems to us quite

11

clear that the claim was provided for by the plan.

12

The plans are set forth in the joint appendix,

13

and they state that the arrearages will be paid out over

14

specified monthly periods and stated monthly installments.

15

Under any natural reading of the phrase "to provide,"

16

those claims were provided for by the plan and accordingly

17

are entitled to compensation for delay under 1325(a)(5).

18

I'd like to address two other points that have

19

come up.

20

that in other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code,

21

specifically sections 1124 and 365, Congress expressly

22

provided for compensation for delay, but somehow in this

23

case the statute is any less clear.

1

problem with that argument is that it looks solely to

2

section 1322(b)(5).

3

compensation for delay in this context is 1325(a)(5), and

4

as I've mentioned, this claim is clearly covered by that

5

section, and it just as clearly provides for compensation

6

for delay as any of the other provisions.

QUESTION:

The place where Congress provides for

If it is so clear that it covers the

compensation for delay in payment, why do you suppose they

reading of the statute after Ron Pair, there are clearly

20

some cases in which interest is going to be paid under the

21

Bankruptcy Code to oversecured creditors, and the statute

22

simply does not state what the interest rate is.

QUESTION:

Of course, if we'd ignored the common

24

interest rule in - - after interest in Ron Pair, we

25

wouldn't have this problem, because the interest would

MR. MANN:

If Ron Pair had been decided the

other way, that would deal with the problem for pre --

QUESTION:

We wouldn't have this problem, yeah.

6

MR. MANN:

But it seems quite clear -- I think

7

you would agree that under section 1325(a)(5), somebody is

8

going to be receiving compensation for delay under that

9

provision.

The opinion in Inwood of Timbers -- Timbers of

10

Inwood Forest strongly suggests that's the purpose of the

11

provision, and I think all the people that have looked at

12

that provision understand that it provides compensation

13

for delay.

14

the claim at issue here is covered.

15

The question in this case is simply whether

And finally, one thing I would like to -- to add

to emphasize the reasons why it makes sense for there to

to remember that section 502(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code

disallows all claims for interest after the petition has

we're dealing today.

17

Other than deacceleration of a home mortgage and

the right to foreclose pending continuation or maintenance

modification of a home mortgage, and that is consistent

21

with the interaction of sections 1322(b)(2) and (b)(5).
