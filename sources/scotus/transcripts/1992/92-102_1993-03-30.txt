ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL H. GOTTESMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Jason Daubert was born missing a part of his

12

right arm and lacking three fingers on one of his hands.

13

Eric Schuller was born missing one of his hands and with

14

one leg shorter than the other.

15

parents had taken Bendectin during the first 2 months of

16

their pregnancy, the period in which the limbs are forming

17

in the fetus.

18

In both instances their

There were no other indications of what might

19

have accounted for these birth defects.

There were no

20

genetic histories, or anything else of the like.

21

Each of these petitioners, with their parents,

22

sued in the State courts of California alleging that the

23

birth defects had been caused by Bendectin and alleging

24

further that Merrell Dow, the sole manufacturer of

25

Bendectin, had been culpable as a matter of State tort law

in the manufacture and the distribution of the drug.
Among other things, the allegations are that

3

Merrell had concealed the discoveries in its own

4

laboratories of the effects that this drug had on animals

5

that were tested and that it did not provide a warning

6

consistent with what its own internal knowledge was of the

7

propensities of the drug.

8

9

If the cases had remained in State court, it is
clear that the expert testimony about causation that is

10

the subject before you today, that that expert testimony

11

would have been admissible as a matter of California law,

12

and we have asserted -- and the assertion is not

13

challenged -- that that evidence would also have been

14

sufficient as a matter of California law to prove

15

causation in this case.

16

But Merrell Dow removed both cases to Federal

17

court on diversity grounds, where they were consolidated,

18

and ultimately Merrell moved for summary judgment.

19

motion did not go to the question of culpability but

20

solely to the question of causation, and its contention

21

about causation was that Bendectin does not, in fact,

22

cause birth defects in humans and that the petitioners

23

would be unable to come forward with any admissible

24

evidence that it does.

25

Its

And they anticipated in the motion that the

1

petitioners indeed would have experts who say that there

2

is causation, but their contention was that testimony

3

would not be admissible under the Federal Rules of

4

Evidence, and in consequence the petitioners would have no

5

admissible evidence to prove causation.

6

Now, the petitioners countered with affidavits

7

and testimonies of eight experts, and I think it's

8

important to note that these are experts several of whom

9

are very highly credentialed and important scientists in

10

their field.

11

toxicology for the Environmental Protection Agency and the

12

chief of pathology at the Food and Drug Administration, in

13

both roles responsible for making these very kinds of

14

determinations about causation.

15

One, Adrian Gross, has been the chief of

Another, Shanna Swan, is the chief

16

epidemiologist for the State of California, responsible

17

for determining the causes of birth defects, and on -- we

18

have described others in our brief.

19

Each of these eight experts in their affidavits

20

and testimony expressed their opinion that it is likelier

21

than not that Bendectin is a teratogen in humans at the

22

normal therapeutic dose, that is, that it causes birth

23

defects in humans, and each has recited that the

24

methodology by which they arrived at that conclusion is

25

the methodology which is regularly and commonly employed

1

by scientists in their fields for making these kinds of

2

determinations.
Indeed, as is shown, and as the two governmental

3
4

experts testified, the methodology they used here is

5

precisely that which they use every day in the performance

6

of their governmental functions, and governmental

7

regulations which we have cited in our briefs say the same

8

thing.

9

Now, what is striking, and I think needs to be

10

noticed, is that in this record there is nothing that

11

challenges that the methodology that these eight experts

12

employ is not the common and regular methodology for

13

making these determinations.

14

Merrell did not, in response to these

15

affidavits, make any record demonstration, did not cite a

16

single person who claimed that this methodology was not

17

appropriately employed, but both courts below, responding

18

to and accepting the contention made by Merrell Dow,

19

concluded that the proper measure for determining

20

admissibility of expert testimony under the Federal Rules

21

of Evidence is that which was prescribed in the Frye test,

22

namely that the methods and the principles on which the

23

experts' opinions are based must be those that are

24

generally accepted in the scientific community, and

25

applying that standard, both courts said that that had not

1

been demonstrated in this case by the petitioner.
Now, that poses the question of statutory

2

3

construction that this case presents.

4

QUESTION:

Do you say that even under the Frye

5

test this evidence would be admissible, or as we take the

6

case it's either Frye applies or it doesn't?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

7

Well, it was the contention

8

below, the Ninth Circuit having already adopted the Frye

9

case before this case, the petitioners were obliged to

10

argue to the Ninth Circuit that this evidence is

11

admissible even under the general acceptance test of

12

Frye's

13

QUESTION:

What base -- is that issue here?

14

MR. GOTTESMAN:

It is here only in the sense

15

that the sole reason the Ninth Circuit gave for saying

16

that this was not generally accepted was its conclusion,

17

again not drawn from the record, that scientists will not

18

accept the opinions of experts and their methodologies

19

unless those experts have published and had peer review of

20

the opinions that they proffer.

21

Now, we do contend that as an assertion of what

22

constitutes general acceptance, even were that the test,

23

that that is an incorrect and a -- not only incorrect as a

24

matter of fact, because the record shows that indeed

25

scientists do, and a number of scientific organizations

have cited that

that it is both incorrect as a

2

statement of science and incorrect as a construction of

3

the Federal rules.

4

review is not a prerequisite for the admission of

5

scientific expert testimony under the Federal rules.

That is, that Publication and peer

But Your Honor has shaped, I think, the way in

6

7

which the statutory construction issue has to be addressed

8

here.

9

Ninth Circuit applied is indeed the correct construction

The first question is whether the test that the

10

of this Federal statute.

acceptance?

12

That is, does it require general

If the answer to that is no, and there seems to

13

be a rather wide consensus among the various groups in

14

this case that it should be no, the Court then does have

15

to address, I think, well, what is the correct

16

construction of the Federal rules so that, whether it's

17

going to decide this itself or remand for reconsideration,

18

there will be a determination of what the standard is.

19

And what I'd like to do is go through the

20

statutory construction analysis in that two-step way,

21

first demonstrating that general acceptance is not the

22

test, which I think is rather the easier point, and then

23

addressing what is the correct instruction, as to which --

In making that argument,

Mr. Gottesman, I hope you will address whether under

Rule 702 the words,

2

anything about what's required.

3

"scientific knowledge," tell us

Webster's Dictionary defines "knowledge" as

4

applying to a body of known facts or ideas or accepted as

5

truths on good grounds, and I think the word "science" is

6

defined as accumulated and accepted knowledge, so I am

7

curious whether the language employed in 702 doesn't

8

suggest some notion of accepted knowledge.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

9

Well, let me jump ahead to that,

10

Your Honor, although I do want to ultimately get back to

11

laying a firmer foundation.
702 says that if scientific knowledge will

12

13

assist the court a qualified expert may testify thereto.

14

We agree that the word "thereto" qualifies the words,

15

"scientific knowledge," so really the question is what is

16

the importance of the word "thereto" as it relates to

17

scientific knowledge?

18

What the advisory committee note says - - and we

19

suggest that this is very informative.

it and then relate it to this case:

21

that an expert on the stand may give a dissertation or

22

exposition of scientific or other principles relevant to

23

the case, leaving the trier of fact to apply them to the

24

facts."

I'd like to read

that the expert would set forth what is known

7

scientifically, and from that would be permitted to infer

8

what should be concluded from that.

They go through an explanation of what all

together give the trial court some discretion in allowing

17

someone who is called to the stand and is qualified as an

18

expert by showing background and so forth?

19

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Yes.

Rule 703 provides in terms

20

that if the expert is drawing on facts and data which have

21

been generated by others, as, indeed, our experts were,

22

that those facts and data must be such as are reasonably

23

relied upon by experts in that field for making

24

determinations such as are before the Court.

2

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Absolutely, and in this case the

3

record shows without contradiction that the facts and data

upon which these experts relied are indeed precisely the

facts and data upon which all experts rely in making

determinations of whether it is likelier than not that a

That's right.

I mean --

So it's a matter of relevance, but

18

within the area of causation with respect to birth

defects, once any of these experts were qualified as a

20

witness, they could testify as to matters of causation

relied upon.

those that scientists reasonably relied upon.

2

the office of sections 702 and 703 are completed.

3

That said,

There are still two gateways that may lead a

4

court to determine that that evidence is not admissible.

5

One is section 403, which says that even as to otherwise

6

admissible testimony, the court can make on a case-by-

7

case basis -- and this Court has said that it is to be

8

determined on a case-by-case basis by the district

9

court -- the court can make a calculation of whether the

10

probative value of that testimony is substantially

11

outweighed by the danger of misleading, confusing, or

12

prejudicing the jury.

13

But it does not follow -- even if it is in the

14

court's mind that the probative value is low, it does not

15

automatically follow that it is outweighed by a danger

16

of -- and incidentally, I want to be clear we don't think

17

that in this case one could say that the probative value

18

is low, but even if a court thought that, it doesn't

19

follow that the jury is going to be confused or misled.

important safeguard, is not in the rules of evidence.

2

more important safeguard is that a court is entitled to

3

direct a verdict, or in the words of the new Federal rules

4

to direct a judgment, and likewise to grant summary-

5

judgment, if it concludes that even though there may be a

6

scintilla of evidence supporting the petitioners'

7

position, it is overwhelmingly refuted by the contrary

8

evidence such that no reasonable juror could conclude on

9

this body of evidence that the point for which the expert

10

The

is contesting is true.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but before we get to that

12

point, I notice that section 702 that Justice O'Connor

13

inquired about is not part of your calculus, so that once

14

the expert is qualified, subject to the other two sections

15

you mention, he can testify to any area within his

16

expertise whether or not it is based on studies.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

17

Well, Your Honor, no - - 703, we

18

suggest, is - - 703 is the provision in the Federal

19

rules - QUESTION:

But you give no effect to 702 in this

calculus.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

We do, Your Honor.

702 and 703

23

each have their proper office.

703 is the provision that

24

addresses the same thing that the Frye rule did.

25

it says -- its title is "Bases for the Opinions of

Yes, but both refer to scientific

14

knowledge, in effect.

15

notice there are a number of briefs filed here, amicus

16

briefs by people from the scientific community, and they

17

all tell us that scientific knowledge is more than just

18

one person's opinion, that the essence is that it has to

19

be capable of being tested, and something that isn't

20

tested can't be said to be reliable, and if it isn't

21

reliable, it can't assist the trier of fact.

22

I mean, that's the basis, and I

Now, doesn't that suggest that there's a role

23

for the trial judge in determining at the outset what

comes in?

1

confusion of two interfaces that I would like to suggest

2

will explain the role of the arguments that Your Honor has

3

just referred to about things have to be tested and

4

validated and the like.

5

There are, if you will, two different scientific

6

modalities.

One is when we are trying to decide that

7

something has been conclusively established so that we can

8

declare it to be a law of science, and there it is

9

undoubtedly true, scientists do not say, we have now

10

satisfied ourselves that there is an established truth,

11

another law of gravity, if you will, until we arrive at a

12

point of certainty that is replicable, conclusive, et

13

cetera, et cetera, but we live in a world of uncertainty,

14

and for many purposes we can't wait until science arrives

15

at the conclusive answer.

16

Professor Nesson in his extremely cogent article

17

makes this point and makes it, I think, as effectively as

18

it appears anywhere in the literature:

19

contexts in which we are called upon to decide things even

20

though science doesn't have a conclusive answer, and we

21

have to do the best we can."

to make a judgment of what is likelier than not the cause

based upon the materials at hand, and Professor Nesson

4

argues, and, we submit, persuasively, that that is the

same thing that a court is called upon to do when in a

state of scientific uncertainty it has to decide whether

7

causation occurred.
The issue here is not whether the plaintiffs can

issue is whether the plaintiffs can demonstrate that it is

likelier or not that this is causing that, and the

And maybe the issue is whether the

judge can review the expert's determination about the

probabilities in this area of uncertainty.

MR. GOTTESMAN:

20

QUESTION:

Indeed.

The data, you acknowledge, by reason

21

of 703 has to be of a sort that the community would

22

normally rely upon, but there remains the last step, and

23

that is the expert's applying these data to the scientific

24

problem that is relevant to the case and coming up with

25

his conclusion.

individual is an expert, whatever conclusion he arrives at

QUESTION:

Mr. Gottesman, is it fair to say that

2

what you are telling us is that once an expert has been

qualified as an expert in the field, and once the expert

4

has at least made a showing or a showing is at least

5

possible that the expert has based some opinion on the

kind of facts and data that 703 refer to, that the

testimony of the expert himself, that he is competent to

express an opinion on probability -- i.e., the 51 percent

or better chance -- is sufficient to satisfy the

10

foundation or knowledge requirement of 702?

11

MR. GOTTESMAN:

12

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

That is --

So that any expert who says, I can

testify to a probability, necessarily qualifies as

It's as simple as that.

Yes, subject to the back --

QUESTION:

It seems to me, counsel, that 703

simply says that underlying background facts and data are

admissible if the expert reasonably relied upon them, but

that does not go to the question of the qualification of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED
MR. FRIED:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In our view, scientific knowledge, which is what

22

Rule 702 allows an expert to testify to, is that body of

23

propositions which have been produced by the methods and

24

procedures of science, and it is the heart of our claim

25

that the propositions offered by petitioner's witnesses

1

have not been produced by the methods and procedures of

2

science.
As the Court in the Turpin case said regarding

3
4

petitioner's crucial witness here -- and I say crucial,

5

because it is the only witness.

6

witness to testify that it is his opinion that Bendectin

7

caused the limb defects of these petitioners -- said of

8

Dr. Palmer, "Personal opinion, not science, is testifying

9

here.

Dr. Palmer, he's the only

No known basis is offered."

So we do not speak

10

about propositions that have attained the level of

11

certainty of the laws of gravity.

12

I think that this contention shows the whole

13

procedure of the petitioners and their amici attack on

14

what not only this Court -- not only on the courts below

15

but a number of courts have done.

16

is that the courts below have said about the requirement

17

of publication and peer review.

18

They caricature what it

None of those courts have said, and it would

19

have been an absurd thing to say, that scientific opinions

20

or propositions may not be testified to if they have not

21

been published.

22

are either too particular, too fresh, or of too limited

23

interest to be able to attain publication.

24
25

What these courts have said is that publication
and dissemination to the scientific community is a factor.

specifically said that it is a factor in determining the

Is that formulation that you've just

MR. FRIED:

one reading of the Ninth Circuit is that it - - opinion,

not the only reading, but I think one reading of the Ninth

20

Circuit is that it relied on the Frye rule per se, without

21

this modification or explication that we're discussing.

22

MR. FRIED:

Well, as to the opinion of the Ninth

23

Circuit, I think that is virtually -- that opinion is

24

virtually a summary affirmance.

25

take about 5 pages for a summary affirmance.

There are some judges who

In fact, the Ninth Circuit specifically stated

1

2

that it was incorporating the judgments on the same packet

3

of opinions in the First, the D.C., and the Fifth

4

Circuits, as they said,

5

6

into the witnesses' testimony in great detail, and that is

7

incorporated by reference.
The Ninth Circuit, having seen that the Federal

8

9
10

"for the reasons stated by our

courts have passed on this a number of times, simply
incorporated that by reference.
Now, it's quite clear that the Ninth Circuit was

Now, Frye, I think, is simply a shorthand way of

18

designating an approach, and this is another one of the

19

caricatures which the petitioners are required to emit in

20

order to take a very general approach and make it seem

21

extreme.

22

The Frye rule is a very brief sentence in a very

23

brief opinion in 1923.

It represents an approach.

24

an approach which says, and it was familiar in the Federal

25

courts, it was stated very well by Judge Hand in 1901,

It is

that the courts must look to scientific standards to

validate scientific claims.
Now, that approach, which I submit is very-

general, is an approach which reappears in the Federal

rules, and why should it not?

Justice O'Connor was emphasizing -- scientific

knowledge -- bring that approach into the Federal rules.

Why should that approach have been abandoned without a

word?

The very words which

Now, if there had been something like a

discriminate rule -- the Frye rule -- then there would be

12

an argument, and I would think we would be in equipoise at

13

best, but the Frye rule itself is a rather ambiguous --

14

very ambiguous statement.

15

If you look at what the Frye rule itself is --

16

let me read it to you from that decision:

17

which the deduction is made must be sufficiently

18

established to have gained general acceptance in the

19

particular field in which it belongs."

"The thing from

That leaves many questions unanswered, and what

21

I suggest is, it is representative of an approach that

there must be a foundation, the foundation must be a

look to the community of science and to scientific

standards to validate scientific claims.

MR. FRIED:

3

These animal studies, if properly

conducted, and some of them were, are scientific

knowledge, without doubt.
The opinion based upon them is an opinion which

6

7

does not comport with Rule 703, because Rule 703 -- and

8

here the advisory committee notes are particularly
important - - does not speak only of the type of

information, but also the selection of information, and

the reference there to public opinion research in the

Furthermore, the Canadian study which was

inappropriate to reach conclusions about human

There is one well-known textbook which points

out that there are 1,200 known animal teratogens and only

to the questions of the Chief Justice and Justice Stevens

9

are that you place principally reliance on Rule 703, and

10

you say that this was not evidence on which an expert

11

could reasonably rely.

was just to allow the admission in evidence of facts that

are essentially hearsay facts.

play to Rule 702 at all.
MR. FRIED:

Well, it is our position, elaborated

in the brief, that 703 confirms and works along with 702.
703 allows an expert to base his opinion on

20

hearsay evidence on the premise that the hearsay evidence

21

is being used in a way,

22

of 702 -- that is, to allow the expert to testify to

23

scientific knowledge -- otherwise one would have the

24

anomalous result that an expert may not rely on hearsay

25

evidence in a way that's aberrant, but may rely on

in accordance with the principle

MR. FRIED:

It's an abuse of discretion standard

in a particular case.

The criteria are legal standards,

and therefore are reviewable de novo, and where the facts

do not vary from case to case, then the application of

QUESTION:

1

Can you also tell me whether the so-

2

called Frye principle was followed in civil cases

3

generally, or was it just in the criminal field?
MR. FRIED:

4

I am informed -- actually, I'm

5

informed by petitioners' counsel -- that there are no

6

instances of Frye being cited in civil cases prior to the

7

Federal rules, but it is also the case that expert

8

testimony had not become an important problem at that

9

point.
There is nothing in the statement of the Frye

10
11

rules to suggest, or the approach to suggest that this is

12

a matter only of interest in a criminal context where, by

13

the way, it binds prosecution as well as defense.

QUESTION:

Would you mind commenting before

16

you're through on the proposed standard of the Solicitor

17

General, your former office, and that of Judge Becker in

18

the Downing case?
MR. FRIED:

19

In our view, the standard offered by

20

the Solicitor General does not differ from the standard we

21

offer.

22

Rather, it is a matter of emphasis.
We do not say that dissemination, clear

23

statement, an offer for peer review after dissemination --

24

this is not some bureaucratic requirement - - is a

25

necessary or sufficient condition for admissibility.

The

1

Solicitor General does not say so.

2

We both say that in the circumstances of this

3

case, where petitioners' testimony seeks to comment on,

4

build on and refute a vast body of published statement,

5

and there is no exigency, there are no pressing needs,

6

that that factor is determinate.

7

The Third Circuit also recognized that exposure

8

to scientific scrutiny is a factor, and if something is a

9

factor there must be cases in which the factor is

10

determinate, and we say this is that case.

11

think there is a great difference between us, except of

12

emphasis.

13

QUESTION:

So we do not

Mr. Fried, there is, I take it, a

14

difference between the SG's and Judge Becker's view on the

15

Frye test on the admissibility of an opinion based upon

16

what the Solicitor General called a significant minority

17

view.

18

true?

19

I take it Frye would not let that in.

MR. FRIED:

Is that

Yes, and I think that the Solicitor

20

General is correct there.

21

by the controversy petitioners raise particularly in

22

connection with the testimony of Dr. Swan about the so-

23

called Rothman mode of analysis.

is petitioners' amicus, offers a different statistical

view.

That is a minority

6

We do not claim, the Solicitor General does not

7

claim, I don't think it would be reasonable to claim that

8

the Dr. Rothman procedure is ipso facto inadmissible.

9

That would not be proper.
What is the case is that Dr. Swan, so far as we

10
11

know, never used the Dr. Rothman principle.

12

pointed at it and said that I have something here which

13

contradicts everything else using these other techniques,

14

and that shows why clear statement, dissemination to the

15

scientific community, an invitation for replication and

comment, where all that is possible, is absolutely

crucial.

behavior of the witness.

if you wish, of the proposition -- Has the proposition

12

stepped up to the plate? -- and it's quite interesting

13

that in the First Circuit case, the Lynch case, Dr. Swan

14

had been forced to say something about her premises and

15

methods, and the First Circuit went into it in some detail

16

and totally devastated it as arbitrary and unexplained and

17

quite unreliable.

It's a comment on the behavior,

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a nuts-and-bolts

question.

Let's assume that we agree that Frye is too

starchy a standard and we, like you, would find a place

for the Solicitor General's view in construing 702.

should we do in this case?

What

1

MR. FRIED:

Oh, I think quite clearly that in

2

this case there was a judgment, and that judgment was

3

well-based, and the decision should be affirmed.

4

QUESTION:

Should we adopt the Solicitor

5

General's -- let's -- and I'm not suggesting that I'm

6

about to do it, but if I were, should I take this

7

opportunity to urge adoption of the Solicitor General's

8

standards, or should I send this case -- affirm this case

9

with a view that the Solicitor General's standard is open

10
11

for development in the lower Federal courts?
MR. FRIED:

Well, the most striking thing is the

12

Solicitor General in applying his standard concludes that

13

he decision should be affirmed and that the Solicitor

14

General's standards clearly lead to the denial of

15

admissibility in this case.

16

It's been so often said that the Court sits to

17

review judgments and not to revise opinions.

18

in the Ninth Circuit may be viewed as a little breezy and

19

a little summary, but I think the reason for that is the

20

Ninth Circuit said the Federal courts had seen these same

21

witnesses, this same testimony over and over again.

22

has parsed these witnesses and this testimony over and

over again.

2

as for the reasons they give, we rule this inadmissible.
QUESTION:

4

But those cases weren't parsing

MR. FRIED:

5

The Brock case is very revealing in

6

this.

The Brock case speaks my language, I believe, and

7

the Solicitor General's language.

8

don't say that this is the be-all and the end-all, the

9

failure to state and disseminate and open to scrutiny.

The Brock case says, we

What we do say is that it's very important here.

12

QUESTION:

It

Mr. Fried, is it not true that in

13

Brock they didn't hold the testimony inadmissible, they

14

held it insufficient?

they were acting on JNOV.

1

that if a court says, this is evidence which is so

2

unreliable, which is so marginal that no jury could rest

3

an opinion on it, that that is the equivalent of saying,

4

it is also not evidence which constitutes scientific

5

knowledge, or which, if considered by the jury, would not

6

mislead, prejudice --

7

QUESTION:

Well, that may be, but I suppose one

8

possible disposition in this very case, if we weren't sure

9

about the admissibility but we thought they'd applied the

10

wrong standard, would be to send it back and either say,

11

review the admissibility issue again, or, the evidence is

12

admissible but you may still grant your summary judgment

13

for the defendants, as they did in Brock.

14

MR. FRIED:

Well, it's striking that the Brock

court as well as the Ninth Circuit treated those two

16

standards as really interchangeable.

You can either do it

In both cases, what we are talking about,

Justice Stevens, is the duty and authority of a Federal

judge to assure that a jury verdict either has been or

will be rationally based.

denied?

while before I said that.

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FRIED:

I would think you would, yes.

But that seems to be your argument.
I would say that the Ninth Circuit

7

and the Fifth Circuit were treating those as

8

interchangeable issues, as was the Turpin decision in the

9

Sixth Circuit on summary judgment.

10

They were treating

those as equivalent issues.
QUESTION:

judgment that summary judgment should be granted because

the plaintiff could not come up with admissible testimony?

That was the decision in the Lynch

MR. FRIED:

Yes.
That was the decision in the

Richardson case, and those cases also were incorporated by

reference by the Ninth Circuit quite explicitly, and they

22

did not -- and they were not summary judgment, they were

23

indeed admissibility cases.

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. FRIED:

Well, I don't know whether they

3

would speak my language in another case, but what they

4

said was to emphasize a factor which is dispositive here.

5

I cannot believe that the Lynch court or the Richardson

6

court would say of an opinion about what caused a

7

particular accident that that opinion had to be published

8

or peer-reviewed -- certainly not.
Those cases referred to publication and peer

review in the context of the circumstances, in the context

11

of that case.
QUESTION:

12

13

Why do you think this factor is

determinative in this case?
MR. FRIED:

14

It is determinative because the

petitioners seek to overcome and, indeed, use published

16

peer review material.

I thank the Court for its attention.
