CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in 91-7358, Todd A. Brecht v. Gordon A. Abrahamson.

Mr. Shoenberger.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN E. SHOENBERGER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHOENBERGER:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
Mr. Brecht was convicted after a jury trial

10
11

after the special prosecutor in this case first on cross-

12

examination of Mr. Brecht then on re-cross initial closing

13

argument and final closing argument, breached a promise

14

that had been made to Mr. Brecht that if he remained

15

silent at a certain point in time that silence would not

16

be used against him.

17

The case involves a core due process violation.

18

It does not involve the Miranda case itself, nor is it a

19

case that involves a prophylactic rule or a prophylactic

20

right.

21

Let me explain.

QUESTION:

The promise that was made to

him could have been any promise.
The promise was made, and that's important, but

5

the promise is analogous to the promise that was made in

6

Johnson v. United States, United States v. Hale, Raley v.

7

Ohio, Santobello v. New York, which is the plea bargain

8

line of cases, as well as what was stated in the Cupps v.

9

Louisiana case, where the officers told certain civil

10

rights demonstrators that they had the right to go and

11

demonstrate at a certain place, and then those same

12

demonstrators were prosecuted for demonstrating near the

13

courthouse.

14

In all of these cases, the State told somebody

15

they had a right to do something, then attempted in one

16

way or another to penalize them, and this Court in all of

17

those cases said that the use of that penalty against that

18

person violated due process.

19

It's also not -- this case is also not a

20

prophylactic case.

21

rule, because all that Mr. Brecht is seeking is the

22

specific performance of the promise that was given to him

23

that if he remained silent, that silence would not be used

24

against him.

It does not involve a prophylactic

this case is a zero.

He's seeking exactly the due process

2

performance, the specific performance of the promise that

3

was made that at the trial which was going to be

subsequent, or was subsequent to the promise that was

5

made, that the State not be permitted to use its breach of

6

that promise to attempt to secure his conviction.

seeks that to be excluded.

He

The constitutional violation in Mr. Brecht's

8

case would occur at trial.

It's not like the questions of

10

illegal searches and seizures where this Court may have to

11

deal with cases after the constitutional violation has

12

occurred, and the question of remedying that violation

13

that's already occurred is part of what this Court has to

14

consider.

15

In addition, the case involves, and Doyle

16

involves, a question of the legitimacy of inferences.

17

This case does go to what kind of inference can be drawn

18

from the silence.

1

an inference can become so tenuous that it violates due

20

process to draw the inference.

21

At a certain point, we would contend,

I would suggest that Justice O'Connor's opinion

22

in Estelle v. McGuire suggests the possibility of such

23

matters, but in this case there's a problem of

24

unreliability, that the inferences that may be drawn from

25

his silence and the use of that silence after the Miranda

warning is certainly unreliable.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Shoenberger, he wasn't explicitly

3

told that if he remained silent that silence would not be

4

used against him, was he?

5

MR. SHOENBERGER:

There was no explicit statement in

this case.

from a Miranda warning.

That explicit

statement - -

7

10

No.

You're just relying upon the general inference

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Yes, and as this Court has

interpreted in Doyle and subsequent cases.
Actually, it's not exactly clear what statement

13

was made to him.

14

first appearance in court he was given his Miranda rights,

15

but the record that I have seen does not actually contain

16

a text of the rights that were given to him, so we're

17

assuming that the Miranda rights were the typical set of

18

Miranda rights.

19

The record only reflects that at the

QUESTION:

Well, it's true, isn't it, every

20

court that's dealt with this so far has found a Doyle

21

violation, so that's the -- the premise for your argument

22

is clear, isn't it?

23

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Every court except the first

24

court, the trial court -- the most important one.

25

didn't find a Doyle violation, and it let the prosecutor

was using despite the fact that they were objected to

QUESTION:

That's right, it was found to be

error and harmless error in the State appellate court.
MR. SHOENBERGER:

6

The appellate court -- the

7

State appellate court found it was not harmless error, the

8

Wisconsin Supreme Court found it was harmless error, and

9

that's the only court that has found it to have been

10

harmless error.
QUESTION:

11

Well, that was the standard they

12

applied -- harmless error.

MR. SHOENBERGER:

17
18

That's correct.

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Yes, Your Honor, you're the

sixth.
The fact that each court has reversed the

22

decision, in effect, of the court before suggests the

23

closeness of the issue in terms of this particular case,

24

and since this is a case about the allocation of risks, of

appropriate case that the current Chapman standard remain

QUESTION:

3
4

So what happened in the district

court on Federal habeas?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

5

The district court -- the

6

district court properly applied the Chapman standard and

7

found that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable

8

doubt, that the State had failed to meet its burden, and

9

found specifically that the use of the silence, the

10

impermissible use of the silence, may have been critical

11

to the actual - QUESTION:

So it disagreed with the State

MR. SHOENBERGER:

The court of appeals applied a

different standard, reversing the district court, yes,

Honor.
QUESTION:

Do you think that a Federal court on

23

habeas owes some deference to State court findings as in

24

this case that the error was harmless?

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Not to the findings that the

error was harmless.

2

deference that is supposed to be paid.

3

At least, there's no absolute

This Court in Brown v. Allen many years ago

4

suggested that these kinds of issues are ones in which you

5

should certainly pay attention to the State's --

6

QUESTION:

Yes, the State court is presumably in

7

a better position to make that determination than the

8

Federal court.

9

isn't appropriate?

10

I wonder why deference to those findings

MR. SHOENBERGER:

The deference that is due, is

11

what this Court said in Brown v. Allen, is what those

12

findings are entitled to, but no more than that.

13

This Court, or Federal courts under habeas have

14

a different command, a command that's narrowed to the

15

guardianship of particular Federal rights, normally

16

Federal constitutional rights, and in its special charge

17

given to it by Congress, both to it and to the Federal

18

district courts, it has an obligation -- or the Federal

19

courts have an obligation to see that fundamental rights

20

remain to be protected.

21

QUESTION:

Why do you suppose we don't apply a

22

rule that in determining whether there is a due process

23

violation in the first instance you have to examine

24

whether there's been any harm done?

1

2

there was a violation of due process in the first place?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

This Court can certainly

3

establish due process rules in that manner, and I think in

4

some cases it may have.

5
6

7

QUESTION:

I mean, that would be typical.

In

some cases we've done exactly that, have we not?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

But in the Doyle case line

8

this Court has not started off that way.

It started off

9

by saying that this is a violation itself, creating a

10

bright line test which at least eliminates the difficult

11

questions that often occur of whether or not a

12

constitutional violation has occurred.

13

The fact of the violation is not really

14

contested in this Court.

Hale isn't contested, I think,

15

in even the Federal district court in this case.

16

question's always been the things that can be drawn from

17

that violation.

The

18

For most of this Court's history, habeas corpus

19

review, once habeas corpus review reaches the merits, has

20

applied the same standard of review for habeas corpus as

21

this Court has applied on direct appeal.

22

Now, there's a big caveat.

Today, as the Court

23

knows, there are many hurdles to getting into a Federal

24

habeas corpus court and reaching the merits.

25

questions of exhaustion, the abuse of the writs, waiver,

So he's one of those few cases that have managed
to make it through the entire minefield of procedural
barriers to seek to reach a determination about the merits

of the core issue that's presented.
Moreover, it involves no Teague issue.

11

He's not

seeking any kind of different right that would otherwise

have not been available to him on direct appeal.

the Teague rule as simply stating that you get no more

when you go up on habeas corpus than you would have gotten

had you gone up directly on certiorari on direct appeal

and submitted to the court under the rules of law

applicable at that point in time.

QUESTION:

We see

What was your explanation for the

20

phenomenon that the rule on 2255 in Federal habeas, the

21

standard of review, seems to differ from that of

this difference?

MR. SHOENBERGER:

1

Well, the cases that I've

2

seen -- I'm assuming I'm thinking about the same sort of

3

case line -- would suggest that in Federal -- Federal

4

habeas corpus in 2255 relief, it's quite analogous to, or

5

the Court treats it as analogous to, in some instances

6

such as out of the District of Columbia convictions, that

7

are effectively the same as in State court.
The more recent decision -- the case name slips

8

9

my mind right now -- is really an application of Teague

10

without announcing at the time, because it predates Teague

11

but Teague principles are involved, suggesting that the

12

same rule, the same substantive rule, ought to apply on

13

2255 at the time of the case, had it gone up on direct

14

appeal.

15

QUESTION:

What about the standard for

16

determining whether or not there's reversible error?

17

Should the standard be the same in both proceedings, State

18

habeas and 2255, or Federal habeas to a State proceeding

19

on the one hand and 2255?

20

MR. SHOENBERGER:

I think different

21

considerations may sometimes apply, particularly when

22

you're coming from Federal jurisdictions and Federal

23

convictions.

Well, that would indicate --

MR. SHOENBERGER:

QUESTION:

Part of the --

That would indicate that we would

5

have a broader standard of review over a Federal

6

conviction.

7

MR. SHOENBERGER:

I don't think it speaks to the

8

standard of review, or the appropriateness of the standard

9

of review.

I think it speaks to the question of this

10

Court's power.

11

Criminal Procedure and the rules for purposes of habeas

12

corpus relief that this Court has announced, or - - and

13

Congress has enacted, that imports a whole set of

14

different considerations that are not applicable in 2254

15

cases, and so it may be that certain --

16

The interplay between the Federal Rules of

QUESTION:

Well, I'm asking what those different

17

considerations are, because it seems to me that at root is

18

the proposition or the premise that State courts are not

19

as adept or as capable as enforcing Federal rights of

20

determining them as the Federal courts are.

21

MR. SHOENBERGER:

I don't think that's part of

22

the proposition.

23

Federal courts, at least this Court in particularly,

24

ultimately is to decide Federal constitutional questions.

The constitutional plan indicates that

as capable and as willing to enforce Federal rights as

3

Federal courts are.

MR. SHOENBERGER:

I don't think that's at issue.

Congress has said that Federal - QUESTION:

Well, if it's not at issue, are you

7

willing to put the argument on that basis?

8

willing to accept that as a premise?

9

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Are you

No, I'm not willing to accept

10

that, and I think this Court has several times suggested

11

that that argument is inappropriate, that there is an

12

obligation that Federal courts have to ensure that State

13

courts tow the constitutional line, or tow the

14

constitutional mark when reviewing the Federal

15

constitutional questions which they sometimes must review,

16

and that in the ideal world there would be no lesser

17

standard and no lesser guarantee of Federal constitutional

18

rights in State courts.

19

QUESTION:

But in applying those rights to

20

determine whether or not a conviction should be reversed

21

under a Chapman standard or some other standard, aren't

22

the State courts in an equal or better position than the

Federal courts to make that determination?

QUESTION:

So is the difference one of

competence between the two types of tribunals?
MR. SHOENBERGER:

No.

The difference is one of

17

the charge that Congress made to Federal district courts,

18

to courts of appeals, and this Court, that they are

19

supposed to enforce Federal constitutional rights under

20

the Federal habeas corpus provisions in 2254.

21

To go back for a second to 2255, in 2255 cases,

22

there has already been a Federal court, or possibly

23

several Federal courts, that in theory have already

24

addressed the issue, so the interests of ensuring that

courts tow the constitutional mark applies in a different

2

There's already a Federal tribunal that has addressed the

3

case at some point.

4

That's not true on 2254, and it may be an

5

additional reason for different treatment in these cases.

6

I would not suggest that it's still appropriate that the

7

Chapman standard should be changed for 2255, although

8

that's not at issue in this case.

The harmless error standard, we would suggest,

is the appropriate standard.

It's also stare decisis on collateral attack

15

certainly since Rose v. Clark in 1986, and I would suggest

16

as well, since six justices expressed that opinion in

17

Dutton v. Evans in 1970, and all of the cases that are

18

cited in the reply brief, justice after justice after

19

justice in opinion after opinion has suggested that the

20

harmless error standard is appropriate in 2254 cases.

21

It's a standard that works.

It's worked for

22

many years.

It involves the application of de novo

review, certainly of questions of law and mixed questions

Mr. Shoenberger, whether harmless error is a question of

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Out of what I count up as five

2

particular statements that the courts that have reviewed

3

below have found to have breached the Doyle rule, only

4

one, I believe, legitimately fits into a dispute category

5

in terms of its referent, and that, the ambiguity in terms

6

of that referent under Doyle and under Chapman ought to

7

count in favor of Mr. Brecht in terms of trying to figure

8

out whether there was a possible impact under Chapman to

9

the conviction.

10

QUESTION:

Well, the district court in granting

11

habeas certainly identified the post-Miranda statements

12

that he relied on as saying that it might have made a

13

difference.

14

MR. SHOENBERGER:

That's right.

That's right,

15

and that's why we're here today, because we believe it did

make a difference, that there are enough post-Miranda

rights, post-Doyle violations in this case that it might

18

have made a difference to this particular jury.

2

This went right to the core of the case, right

to the core of whether or not there was a constitution --

We would suggest that maintaining the Doyle
rule, or maintaining Chapman,

is quite appropriate in

terms of comity, because it does allow Federal courts to

5

MR. SHOENBERGER:

But unless this Court said

6

that complete deference of the type that Stone v. Powell

7

is involved, would be appropriate, the Federal courts

8

would still have to decide something, and in fact we

9

suggest in our brief that the standard on Kotteakos

2

was entitled to.

3

We believe that the Federal court should take,

4

for what it's worth, the State court determination, but

5

the Federal court has, under the habeas corpus, statute, a

6

duty and an obligation to review the Federal

7

constitutional rights that are involved and to make the

8

right decision at that point.

9

QUESTION:

Well, you say take it for what it's

10

worth, which of course is a somewhat ambiguous phrase.

11

You can say, it means no more than if we agree with it,

12

we'll accept it, if we don't we'll reject it.

13

What I'm suggesting is that maybe a Federal

14

court is obliged, even if it would not have come out that

15

way itself, to say that the State court finding of

16

harmless error shouldn't be set aside.

on other questions.
MR. SHOENBERGER:

Well, in one sense there are

3

very few questions of law, for example, now, that are

4

cognizable in habeas corpus at least in terms of new cases

5

since the Teague rule establishes that we have to simply

6

take the case of law, applying existing legal rules, so in

7

effect you'd be closing the doors to virtually all Federal

8

habeas corpus over State courts, were you to adopt a rule

9

that does what you're suggesting.

10

QUESTION:

Oh, I don't see that -- I don't see

11

that at all, because all we're talking about is a harmless

13

MR. SHOENBERGER:

But harmless error is -- the

harmless error determination speaks to virtually all

constitutional violations except for those few categories

There was some ambiguity initially as to whether

earlier point in time, the ambiguity earlier than the

initial appearance.

prosecutor at no time singled out the post-Miranda

3

The only thing he did wrong was speak a little

too broadly, so that in asking questions or commenting, he

used words like, isn't this the first time you ever, and

6

isn't it true that you never, and those words got him into

trouble because they encompassed both the pre-Miranda and

8

the post-Miranda, and in this case, of course, there was a

9

ton of pre-Miranda silence and conduct that was very, very

20

probative of guilt, such as him fleeing the scene and

21

stealing the victim's car, and heading for the State line,

22

instead of calling for help, which one would expect if it

I'm not sure that I understand your

The fact is, most State convictions are not

reviewed on direct review at all.

We don't grant many

is, whatever effect Federal jurisdiction generally has on

Why, therefore, shouldn't the standard be just as high as

5

limited to those situations in which it can be said that

6

the petitioner has been deprived of fundamental fairness,

7

that somehow the error is not just error that we cannot

8

prove harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, but that it is

9

error that so infected the entire trial that the

10
11

conviction itself is a denial of due process.
One way to state that is the way that Justice

12

Stevens stated in Miller v. Greer and Rose v. Lundy, which

13

is that errors that are so fundamental that they infect

14

the validity of the underlying judgment itself should be

15

granted relief.

16

We think that that is an appropriate view, but

17

it does not give a measuring stick, it doesn't tell lower

18

courts how to figure out when we have reached that level,

19

and what we are suggesting is that any of the three tests

20

that we have proposed, either Kotteakos, which the

21

7th Circuit used, or our Jackson v. Virginia formulation,

22

or our Strickland formulation, would be an adequate test.

23

It would be sufficient to identify those cases

24

where the conviction and the resulting custody have truly

25

deprived the defendant of fundamental fairness as opposed

MS. WELLMAN:

9

That's true.

That is --

That is the least protective.

We

think it is still consistent with habeas because what

10

we're saying is, if you can take the infected or bad

11

material out and you still have sufficient proof beyond a

12

reasonable doubt, you cannot say that the State really

13

depended on that -- that they could not have a conviction

14

without that evidence, but we agree that either Kotteakos

15

or Strickland would serve the same purpose and yet be more

16

protective or more - - give more credence to the risk that

17

even though yes, the State could prove its case without

18

that evidence, that evidence might have influenced the

19

verdict.

20

So all of these really are sort of on a

continuum of looking at what would have happened if this

willing to take?

harmless error.

It has also a deterrent purpose and an

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. BARR

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. BARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

6

The position of the United States is that the

7

harmless error standard that should apply on collateral

8

review of constitutional errors is the traditional

9

Kotteakos standard.

The Kotteakos rule is the traditional

10

formulation of the harmless error doctrine derived from

11

the common law approach which later found its way into the

12

Federal statutes of 1919 and 1949 and now the Federal

13

rules.

14

Chapman is the exception to that traditional

15

doctrine, and in Chapman this Court formed a stricter, a

16

ratcheted up harmless error standard, and in that context,

17

on direct review of constitutional errors, that

18

ratcheted-up standard serves a deterrent function

19

promoting rigorous adherence to constitutional norms at

20

the trial phase.

21

Now, we submit that this should not be carried

22

over to collateral review, the Chapman standard, and this

23

Court has never directly addressed this issue.

24
25

We think there are three reasons for this.
First, Kotteakos fully effectuates the purposes of habeas
42

1

corpus.

Habeas is not supposed to be a full replay of

2

direct review, and there should be no presumption that the

3

rules and the standards that apply on direct review

4

necessarily carry over to habeas corpus review, and for

5

that reason this Court has repeatedly recognized that the

6

rules that apply on habeas should be tailored to the

7

purposes of habeas, and may be different than the rules

8

and the standards that apply in direct review.

9

Now, the core purpose of habeas is to protect

10

against the kind of serious constitutional defect that

11

gives rise to a substantial risk that an innocent person

12

has been convicted, and Kotteakos is fully sufficient to

13

meet that standard.

14

on direct review of nonconstitutional errors which can be

15

more prejudiced than many constitutional errors such as

16

404(b) violation, and in that context we rely upon the

17

Kotteakos standard, whether there's been a substantial

18

influence in determining the jury's verdict, to assure

19

us
QUESTION:

20

After all, it is the rule that we use

General Barr, would you go so far as

21

to say that's true in those cases that have been automatic

like that?

MR. BARR:

No, Justice Stevens.

say is, there are essentially three boxes.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

What I would
The first

1

issue is, is a claim reviewable at all under habeas

2

corpus, or should it receive Stone v. Powell treatment,

3

but if it's a cognizable claim, the next issue is, is it

4

automatically reversible, and there may be some debates

5

about that test, but I don't think Doyle meets that test,

6

and that would put, then, Doyle in the subject-to-

7

harmless- error analysis box.
So if we can rely on Kotteakos on the direct

8

9

review of nonconstitutional errors to sort out the

10

reliability of the verdict, I think we can rely upon it in

11

habeas corpus context.
The second reason, I think, that we shouldn't

12

13

just carry over the Chapman standard, is that the benefits

14

of Chapman -- and this goes to your comments, Justice

15

Souter -- the benefits of Chapman are largely achieved on

16

direct review.

17
18

It's the presence --

that?

You say that.

MR. BARR:

How do we know that?
That -- the -- if it doesn't perform

20

a deterrent function on direct review, then what's the

21

purpose - -

22

QUESTION:

Well, I'm sure it performs some, but

23

again, given the fact that to the extent that a Federal --

24

that the guarantee of the Federal system is an element at

25

some point in enforcing the Chapman standard, and given

'I

1

the fact that direct review by a Federal court is

2

extraordinarily limited, how do we know, as

3

fact, that a substantial deterrent function is being

4

performed by direct review alone, and it will not be

5

sacrificed if we adopt a lesser standard on collateral?

6

MR. BARR:

matter of

That question boils down to this:

7

will a prosecutor facing Chapman on direct review through

8

the State system and potentially on cert in the Federal

9

system really play fast and loose with the Constitution

10

because he may be facing down the road on collateral

11

review Kotteakos rather than Chapman?

12

QUESTION:

Well, the -- you can focus it on the

13

prosecutor only if you, I suppose, limit your argument in

14

this case to the application of the Kotteakos standard in

15

a Doyle case and not to habeas generally.

16

But even aside from that, it isn't merely the

17

prosecutor whom we are supposedly influencing, it's the

18

State courts, and I think one of the questions about

19

deterrence that has to be asked is whether the State

20

courts will simply as a fact feel as great a need to be on

21

their toes if there is a lesser standard for the vast

22

majority of State cases that will be reviewed later by a

23

Federal court, and I don't see anything self-evident about

24

your statement that they will be.

25

MR. BARR:

Well, the Kotteakos standard has

1

worked for nonconstitutional errors, which can be just as

2

prejudicial as a constitutional error, and it's also

3

essentially the standard that we use - - the Kotteakos

4

standard, whether there's a substantial probability of

5

prejudice -- is the standard we use on Donnelly v.

6

DeChristoforo potential due process violations in the

7

State system, it's the standard we use for ineffective

8

assistance of counsel in the Strickland case, although the

9

burden is shifted by Strickland and DeChristoforo.

10

So it hasn't -- there's no evidence that has led

11

to a breakdown of the State criminal justice system or

12

ignoring or flouting constitutional standards.

13

^

While the benefit, we maintain, of carrying over

14

the Chapman rule to collateral review is slight, if any,

15

from a deterrence standpoint, we believe the costs are

16

high.

17

that did not substantially influence the outcome of the

18

case derogate from the truth-seeking function of the

19

criminal justice system, undermine the Federalism interest

20

and the interest in finality, and breeds disrespect for

the criminal justice system as a whole.

Overturning final criminal convictions for errors

Now, there is no constitutional or statutory

23

command to select either the Chapman standard or the

24

Kotteakos standard under habeas corpus.

25

constitutional reason for doing it, and there's certainly

We see no

1

nothing in the statute dictating the selection of one or

2

the other of those standards, and therefore it's a

3

prudential matter as to how much respect is going to be

4

given to the Federalism interest,

and fact akin to a sufficiency determination, and as you

May I ask, General Barr, in your --

6

in the notion of deference, do you think it is part of the

7

duty of the Federal court to read the entire record under

8

either standard, Kotteakos or Chapman?
MR. BARR:

9

Yes, I do, Justice Stevens.

10

the Kotteakos case discusses that extensively, the

11

obligations of the court.

I think

12

The -- so it's our position that if a claim is

13

cognizable under habeas, and if it's subject to harmless

14

error review, then one standard should apply, and that is

15

the Kotteakos standard.

16

Now, in this case, as I indicated, there doesn't

17

seem to be a plausible argument that this is the kind of

18

fundamental or structural defect that puts it into the

19

automatic reversal category.
QUESTION:

20

May I ask you just one final

21

question?

22

to confine the rule you want to Doyle cases?

23

Is there any reason to, if we accept your view,

MR. BARR:

There is an argument for, obviously,

24

limiting it to the Doyle case or just deciding the Doyle

25

case here, based on what the purpose of the Doyle rule is.

And if those considerations are taken into
account, then a more limited holding could be issued.
QUESTION:

But there's nothing essential in your

argument that confines it to Doyle, really.
MR. BARR:

No.

I don't think that the truth­

10

seeking or the nontruth-seeking distinction for harmless

11

error analysis should generate two different harmless

12

error rules.

13

into account in determining whether or not the rule is

14

automatically -- the error is automatically reversible, or

15

whether it's subject to harmless error at all.

I think that distinction should be taken

QUESTION:

Thank you, General Barr.

Mr. Shoenberger, you have 3 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ALLEN E. SHOENBERGER

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20

MR. SHOENBERGER:

Thank you, Chief Justice.

21

Let me state first that the rule in Chapman is

22

not based upon any particular statute.

It was an attempt

23

by this Court to devise what it described in the decision

24

itself as a Federal right or a Federal rule, and it

25

appears it may be a constitutional rule because it's so

1

closely allied with the enforcement of constitutional

2

rights, but it certainly -- Chapman certainly was not

3

interpreting the Federal habeas corpus statutes itself,

4

because the Federal habeas corpus statutes weren't

5

involved.

6

That came later, although a case was argued 4

7

days before Chapman was announced, the first case in which

8

Justice Black indicated that Chapman ought to apply in

9

Federal habeas corpus, but it's at least until

970 that

10

the first, if you will, majority of the Court in

11

collective different decisions indicated that Chapman

12

applied on Federal habeas corpus, as far as I can find.

3

The standards in Jackson are completely

4

inappropriate for this kind of a case.

5

that the jury fact-finding is untainted by any error and

6

then looks at the result of that fact-finding to see

7

whether that fact-finding is so out of the realm of

8

permissibility that it has to be overturned.

9

Jackson assumes

We're talking here about a case where

20

constitutional error clearly occurred, and we submit it

21

had a direct truth-finding relationship to the jury fact­

22

finding, so you start off with a tainted jury

23

determination.

24

I don't think I heard correctly, but I almost heard that

25

the question was a question of percentage.

How much that taint -- I almost heard, and

Did it have a

1

5 percent or 20 percent difference in terms of the

verdict?

We can't tell.

The jury is in the jury room.

Only it knows.

Do you think it would be error if the

district judge on Federal habeas said well, this is an

10

awfully close case, I probably would have come out

11

differently in deciding harmlessness than the State

12

Supreme Court did, but it's a close case and I'll just go

13

along with the State Supreme Court?
