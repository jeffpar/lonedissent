ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. TARANTO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

12

an order denying a state entity's claim of Eleventh

13

Amendment immunity is immediately appealable as a

14

collateral order.

15

because of the well-established law that Puerto Rico,

16

though not itself a state, is entitled to sovereign

17

immunity under the same standards as apply directly to

18

states under the Eleventh Amendment.

19

held that the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority is

20

not an arm of the state and denied the Authority's

21

immunity claim.

QUESTION:

The question arises in this case

Yes.

So even if it were jurisdictional we

would have authority to behave that way, wouldn't we?
MR. TARANTO:

I think that the question comes to

21

this Court on the assumption that the merits of the claim,

22

going to the appealability issue, that the claim is

23

meritorious, and the only question then is whether the

24

denial of that assumedly meritorious claim should be

25

immediately appealable.

1

The First Circuit held that the denial of

2

sovereign immunity is not a collateral order, and its only

3

rationale was that the Eleventh Amendment in its view

4

protects only a state's interest in avoiding the

5

imposition of monetary judgments and interests that can be

6

vindicated by appeal after trial.

7

Our position is that the First Circuit was wrong

8

because it misunderstood the basic character of Eleventh

9

Amendment immunity.

The rationale is squarely

10

contradicted by this Court's repeated holdings that apply

11

the Eleventh Amendment to bar equitable relief.

12

far back as Ex parte Ayers and more recently Alabama

13

against Pugh and Cory against White directly hold that the

14

Eleventh Amendment immunity, as the language of the

15

Amendment itself requires, goes beyond protecting against

16

monetary relief.

17

holding was wrong.

18

Cases as

More broadly, the First Circuit's

My central point is that the Eleventh Amendment

19

immunity, where it applies, must be viewed as protecting a

20

state's right not to be sued.

21

QUESTION:

But have we held that an agency of

22

this state, apart from the state itself, is entitled to

23

anything more than protection against monetary liability?

Yes.

QUESTION:

Wasn't the state itself a party in

MR. TARANTO:

The state was, and the Department

the dismissal of both of those parties.

the state in the same sense as any department of the state

And the Puerto

10

would be, notwithstanding its somewhat different form of

11

organization.

12

The First Circuit's contrary view rested on a

13

mistake in treating a doctrine that overrides the Eleventh

14

Amendment, the Ex parte Young doctrine, as if it changed

15

the nature of the immunity where the immunity is not

16

overridden.

17

denied by the district court, presents an appealable

collateral order.

And a right not to be tried, where finally

other elements of a collateral order are clearly

There is therefore no risk that appellate review now

either will be advisory or will have to be repeated later.
Second, the issue whether the Authority is an

There is therefore no risk that the court

10

I gather from the opinion of the

11

First Circuit in this case, Mr. Taranto, that they may

12

have felt differently about it than you do.

13

some expressions in that opinion that it's a very sketchy

14

record that they have to go on?

15

MR. TARANTO:

I don't think so.

Isn't there

The First

16

Circuit did not, as I recall, comment on the merits of the

17

claim of immunity, and the district court's decision

18

turned on one simple fact, the potential monetary

19

liability of the Commonwealth for any judgment in this

20

case.

21

some doubt about the claim of PRASA to sovereign immunity,

22

but that I think cannot be overplayed in its significance.

The First Circuit in an earlier case had expressed

Company in Puerto Rico expressed quite similar doubts,

This Court in I think its two most extensive

analyses of that issue, the Lake Country Estates case and

the Mount Healthy case, noted that the factors essentially

turn on the state's legal treatment of the entity, who

appoints the governing board of the entity, whether it is

4

QUESTION:

But the complexity of the issue could

5

have something to do with whether it's immediately

appealable.

7

MR. TARANTO:

I think that this Court has said

8

that the discretionary nature of the issue could have

9

something to do with that.

I think complexity is no more

10

a problem here than it is in double jeopardy or official

11

immunity cases where some significant amount of legal

12

analysis may be required to identify what the state of the

13

law was at the time of the defendant's conduct, or even in

14

the speech or debate context, whether a particular aide is

15

serving as an alter ego of a member of Congress or whether

16

the member was performing a legislative versus a political

17

function.

18

several factors involved in them, do not involve any

19

district court discretion and so can be decided de novo by

20

a court of appeals as a matter of law.

These are issues that, while they may have

QUESTION:

Well, I take it that if the claim of

QUESTION:

It simply involves an examination of

Mr. Taranto, if we agree with you

15

here, does it mean that there would be an interlocutory

16

appeal in all Federal tort claims cases whenever the

17

Government asserts that it has not waived liability under

18

the Federal Tort Claims Act?

19

that those cases have not been interlocutorily appealed,

20

and there are a lot of them.

21

MR. TARANTO:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. TARANTO:

I mean, my impression is

I think that would not follow.

Why wouldn't it follow?
Because the nature of the

24

sovereign immunity claim in an Eleventh Amendment context

25

is different from the sovereign immunity claim for the

1

United States.

When sovereign immunity is claimed by a

2

state, or Puerto Rico, what it is claiming is that another

3

sovereign has no authority to call it to the bar of the

4

court and demand that it answer.

5

claim of the United States in its own courts is, does not

6

involve the underlying dignitary interest of one sovereign

7

demanding that another answer.

The sovereign immunity

8

So that the Eleventh Amendment sovereign

9

immunity interest is much more akin to the foreign

10

sovereign immunity interest where the law is I think

11

uniformly clear in the lower courts that a denial of

foreign sovereign immunity is immediately appealable

13

because of the underlying purpose.

15

on the merits of a foreign sovereign immunity claim where

16

the order came up from the district court on a collateral

17

order without questioning the propriety of that

jurisdiction.

19

QUESTION:

And this Court last

You think somehow in the domestic

20

sovereign immunity situation there is no right not to be

21

tried, there is just a right not to have a judgment?

22

MR. TARANTO:

Is

I'm not entirely sure what, how

24

25

ought to come out.

The point that I'm making here is that

1

the underlying dignitary interest of one sovereign

2

imposing its authority on another is not present there.

3

Whether there is another --

4

QUESTION:

Well, that's a difference, but why is

5

it a difference that ought to make a difference?

6

sure, it's a different issue, but none of the Cohen

7

factors are any different by reason of that.

8

the Cohen factors would apply to that the same way as they

9

apply to this case.
MR. TARANTO:

10

I mean,

I mean, all

Well, I'm not sure it would

11

because to start with, whether the United States has

12

waived its sovereign immunity will in general be the same

13

question as whether there is a cause of action, because

14

the causes of action tend to be in fact the waivers of

15

sovereign immunity, I think, with the United States.

16

But on the third factor as well, the question of

17

whether a denial is unreviewable after the final judgment,

18

in turn I think goes back to the question of what the

19

nature of the right is, whether it's a right not to be

20

tried.

21

sovereign immunity context the reason I think we know that

22

it is such a right is that the underlying interest is

23

present from the beginning of the lawsuit, that one

24

sovereign through its courts not essentially fail to

25

respect the dignity of another sovereign.

And in the foreign sovereign immunity and state

So I think the

1

2

United States case is a different case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, I didn't go back in the

3

First Circuit cases behind this one, the ones that they

4

relied on for precedent.

5

cases turn on the distinction, a distinction based on the

6

need to respect the dignitary interest, i.e. even though

7

instrumentalities of the state may ultimately be entitled

8

to share in the immunity they do not present such an

9

insistent dignitary claim that we will accord them an

10
11

Do the earlier First Circuit

immediately appealable status?
MR. TARANTO:

Do the cases turn on that?

As far as I am aware the only full

12

discussion of this issue in the First Circuit is in the

13

Libby against Marshall case.

14

court below in this case relied on, and that case doesn't,

15

as I recall, contain any extensive discussion of any

16

argument about the dignitary interest.

17

Ex parte Young and Edelman against Jordan, concludes that

18

as a practical matter there is not really much left to the

19

Eleventh Amendment after those cases except an interest in

20

avoiding monetary judgments.

21

went wrong.

22

That's the case that the

It simply looks at

That I think is where it

The Young and Edelman doctrines do not rest on

23

the judgment that the nature of the Eleventh Amendment

24

immunity is somehow limited to a protection against

25

certain judgments.

They reflect a decision that because

1

of the needs of the Federal system, whatever the Eleventh

2

Amendment immunity is, it has to be overridden in certain

3

circumstances.

4

after Edelman came down the argument was in fact presented

5

to this Court that Edelman's focus on monetary relief

6

really did change the nature of the Eleventh Amendment

7

immunity and rendered it merely a limit on monetary

8

judgments, and this Court explicitly rejected that

9

argument in Cory against White and implicitly did so in

10

And one primary indication of that is that

Alabama against Pugh.

11

It would also, I think, be a mistake to overread

12

Young and Edelman because those cases, after all, apply in

13

only one type of Eleventh Amendment case, only in official

14

capacity suits brought against state officials under

15

Federal law.

16

monetary relief has no application in a case like this one

17

for at least two reasons.

law.

appealability in official capacity suits against

2

individuals as opposed to suits against an entity like

3

this one?

4

MR. TARANTO:

I think that the answer would be

5

the same, that when a individual state, when a state

6

official is sued in his or her official capacity and the

7

claim is, and that official says this suit is improper

8

because the claim is barred by Edelman against Jordan, is

9

really a claim for retrospective monetary relief, that

10

what that claim means is that the state official is saying

11

I am the state.

12

the state, that means that the state is asserting a right

13

not to be tried.

14

And when the state's official says I am

It is true in that circumstance that there is a

15

different issue presented about whether the claim about

16

the nature of the relief is wholly collateral to the

17

merits of the litigation, an issue that's not at all

18

presented when the claim is made by a state entity.

19

do think that the answer would end up being the same

20

because in that case, as in this, the Court need not

21

determine the facts, what the defendant did, or the law in

22

the sense of whether those, that conduct violated any

23

applicable legal norm.

addressed this issue, eight now in number, agree that an

11

Eleventh Amendment immunity claim raises a right not to be

tried and is therefore immediately appealable.

noted, the closest analogy, the Foreign Sovereign

I'd like to make one final point.

And, as I

The dignitary

16

interest that underlies the claim of Eleventh Amendment

17

immunity must be treated as real and important even though

18

it is necessarily somewhat abstract.

19

states reacted so swiftly to Chisolm against Georgia, why

20

framers like Madison and Hamilton and Chief Justice

21

Marshall made such a point of reassuring the states that

22

their sovereign immunity would be respected under the

23

Constitution, and it is why this Court has kept the Ex

24

parte Young doctrine a limited one and has set high

25

standards for finding a waiver or congressional abrogation

That's why the

of the immunity.

to be denied review.

If the immunity is important in all of

For those reasons we suggest that the First

so that the very harm the immunity protects against will

not be irreparably suffered before an appeal can be taken.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER W. SIPKINS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SIPKINS:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

The respondent urges two basic positions upon

15

the Court today with all due respect.

16

this Court find that the Eleventh Amendment is a fiscally

17

driven jurisdictional limitation on the Article III powers

18

of the Federal courts, and that amendment is not motivated

19

by any true concerns for sovereignty or sovereign

20

immunity.

21

interlocutory appeals from denials of motions that are

22

based on that amendment should not lie.

23

First we urge that

As such, we urge that this Court find that

Secondly, we urge another position on the Court

between two critically important and sometimes conflicting

2

principles of sovereignty on the one hand and the final

3

judgment, and the final judgment requirements of section

4

1291 on the other.

5

notions of sovereignty pale in the context of the Eleventh

6

Amendment when it is not the state itself, the state qua

7

state, that is seeking to invoke the Eleventh Amendment,

8

but rather, where as here, it is a sewer corporation that

9

has been chartered by an entity that is, has not been

In so balancing we believe that any

10

determined to be a state for the purpose of the Eleventh

11

Amendment by this very Court.
Generally speaking and at a minimum as a matter

12

13

of law we urge that this Court determine that where

14

sovereignty cannot be found as a matter of law that

15

interlocutory appeals do not lie from the Eleventh

16

Amendment.

QUESTION:

The instrumentality issue isn't what

the court of appeals relied on, is it?
MR. SIPKINS:

That is correct, Justice White.

Nevertheless we believe that for purpose of the balancing

neither expands nor alters the decision of the court

Then why wasn't it phrased in terms

6

of judgments rather than suits?

7

MR. SIPKINS:

Well, the purpose, we believe, of

8

the Eleventh Amendment was to make clear at the time of

9

Chisolm v. Georgia, Justice Souter, that matters that were

10

pending at that time in Federal courts had to be

11

dismissed.

QUESTION:

We're still, perhaps from your

16

standpoint, stuck with the text, and the text still says

17

suits, not judgments.

18

MR. SIPKINS:

Correct, Your Honor, it does

19

clearly say suits.

Nevertheless the language, the

20

historical language of the amendment itself clearly

21

indicates that the framers of that amendment, who knew how

22

to express themselves and what they wanted, did not

23

develop a clear prohibition as they did in the speech and

24

debate clause and in the double jeopardy clause with

25

respect to not having to stand trial.

For example, the first iteration of the Eleventh

Amendment as enacted in the House of Representatives the

3

day, or introduced in the House of Representatives the day

4

after Chisolm v. Georgia stated that no judicial power

shall lie to make a state a defendant in the Federal

courts.

include the language that we currently have that the

8

jurisdictional power, the judicial power of the United

9

States shall not be construed to extend to suits that are

11

That was then amended shortly thereafter to

prosecuted or commenced.
And so what I am suggesting, Justice Souter, is

12

that the framers of the Constitution themselves,

13

understanding the implications of sovereignty and the

14

implications that they had at the time, did not utilize

15

language which clearly precluded the state from being

16

hailed into court.

17

In addition there were no true concerns for

18

sovereignty at the time that the amendment, that the

19

Article III of the Constitution was enacted since after

20

all of the Article III headings three of them specifically

21

mention states themselves, six of them do not mention the

22

states but nevertheless do not expressly exclude states

23

from Federal jurisdiction.

Georgia clearly as a result of concern for the colonies,

then states, that they were fiscally strapped and they did

2

not want to have after the war the state treasuries

3

invaded by the Federal jurists.

where the framers of the amendment stated clearly and

5

unequivocally that there should be no ability of the

6

Federal courts to bring the states before the bar.

7

QUESTION:

This was not a situation

Well, to what extent, Mr. Sipkins,

8

can we look behind the language of the amendment which, as

9

Justice Souter pointed out, speaks in terms of suits?

10

You

say you can look back to earlier drafts?
MR. SIPKINS:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, what I am

12

suggesting is that you can look back to earlier drafts to

13

determine whether the framers clearly intended to preclude

14

suits against sovereigns, and that it was clear that they

15

did not in the earlier drafts because the language was far

16

more clear in the earlier drafts with respect to what they

17

intended.

18

QUESTION:

Well then why not infer that there

19

was some change of intent between the earlier drafts and

20

the language that was finally adopted?

21

MR. SIPKINS:

Precisely so, sir.

Mr. Chief

22

Justice, what we're suggesting is that in making that

23

change the framers of the Eleventh Amendment intended that

24

in certain circumstances you could bring the states before

25

the bar of the court, you simply could not invade the

fisk, that this was a fiscally motivated amendment.
QUESTION:

But how do you draw that deduction

from the language of the amendment itself?
MR. SIPKINS:

Because in those instances --

5

well, you can't from the language of the amendment itself.

6

But if you look at the amendment in the context of the

7

Article III powers of the Constitution and if you look at

8

the amendment, particularly with respect to the speech and

9

debate clause and with respect to the double jeopardy

10

clause where the framers of the Constitution intended to

11

preclude any jurisdiction whatsoever they clearly stated

12

so, and they did not state so here with respect to the

13

Eleventh Amendment.

14

There are problems - -

QUESTION:

Mr. Sipkins, your argument is that

16

it's only meant to protect the state fisk?

square with the fact that we have held that it does

18

protect the states against equitable actions?

19

something of an obstacle to your position?

20

MR. SIPKINS:

How does that

Isn't that

It is indeed an obstacle, and I

21

clearly admit that, Justice Scalia.

What we believe is,

22

and what we suggest today is that this Court's utilization

23

of the concept of sovereign immunity since Hans v.

24

Louisiana in 1890 as a framework or a basis for a number

25

of decisions that this Court has rendered dealing with the

1

Eleventh Amendment was not necessary, and that in fact the

2

concept of sovereign immunity gave rise to a series of

3

decisions that perhaps were not well considered by this

4

Court over time.

5

And that, the reason for Hans v. Louisiana and

6

the need to have state sovereignty as the basis for the

7

Eleventh Amendment was because at the time of Hans v.

8

Louisiana the law of what law, the rule of what law

9

applied to matters pending in Federal courts was Swift v.

10

Tison.

11

states would have their liability determined not under the

12

substantive law of that own jurisdiction, but rather under

13

Federal law.

14

And the states and this Court were concerned that

Since 1938 in Erie v. Tompkins those concerns of

15

the states and the concerns of the courts expressed in

16

Hans v. Louisiana don't exist, and none of the decisions

17

of this Court from Edelman through Pennhurst to Atascadero

18

need to have sovereignty as the basis for that

19

determination.

MR. SIPKINS:

They are founded upon a basis that

4

QUESTION:

So, then the theory you are urging

5

upon us today is inconsistent with those cases, you

6

acknowledge that?

7

MR. SIPKINS:

That is correct.

There are indeed

8

some problems with the current reading of those cases.

9

First this Court has held that the Eleventh Amendment is a

10

jurisdictional bar.

11

of the amendment itself is clear that the judicial power

12

of the United States shall not extend, clearly this Court

13

has held where states waive their sovereignty they can in

14

a sense create that very judicial power, a ruling or a

15

holding which we believe is inconsistent.

16

Nevertheless, although the language

In addition this amendment affects the Federal

17

courts and limits the judicial power of the Federal

18

courts, but says nothing whatsoever about Congress which

19

can abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in appropriate

20

circumstances.
Another problem with the current reading of the

21

22

Eleventh Amendment is that states but not political

23

subdivisions of states such as counties or cities or other

24

local governments are entitled to invoke the Eleventh

25

Amendment.

QUESTION:

Well, do you think it really would

2

make sense from this Court's point of view to give the

3

Eleventh Amendment the sort of overhaul that you're

4

proposing in a case where we're trying to decide whether

5

there is, an order denying Eleventh Amendment immunity is

6

collaterally appealable?

7

MR. SIPKINS:

What we're suggesting, Chief

8

Justice Rehnquist, is that this Court utilize this

9

opportunity to develop some very clear guidelines for when

10

a matter of this nature is appealable, and that we believe

11

that this case presents such a forum or such a vehicle for

12

the Court to utilize to do that.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Well, what's wrong with the

guidelines that were in Cohen v. Beneficial Loan?
MR. SIPKINS:

One of the problems with the

16

guidelines in Cohen v. Beneficial Loan is that -- first of

17

all there are no problems, and we think that if you apply

18

those standards as enunciated and as stated in Coopers &

19

Lybrand v. Livesay several years later that it is easy to

20

say that this particular case does not meet at least two

21

of the three standards of Cohen.

22

determine that the second test of Cohen has been met it is

23

necessary to determine that this matter presents an issue

24

that is too important to be denied interlocutory review,

25

and the only basis upon which it can be determined that

1

this matter is too important to be denied interlocutory-

2

review is if this Court determines that indeed the

3

Eleventh Amendment is based upon precepts of sovereignty.

4

Because if it is not sovereignty but jurisdictional

5

matters themselves which give rise to the Eleventh

6

Amendment, then we are not dealing here with an animal

7

that is too important to be denied review.
In addition we believe that if it is, as we have

8

9

posited, the state fisk that is principally involved in

10

the Eleventh Amendment protections, then certainly the

11

state's fisk, that is the right to force the state to pay

12

or the right to face the state to do something, will be

13

protected upon an appeal from a final judgment after

14

trial.

QUESTION:

I have the same problem as does the

Chief Justice.

adopt a very fundamental position that the idea of

Eleventh Amendment doctrine.

2

MR. SIPKINS:

Well, as I stated, Justice

3

Kennedy, we have suggested two alternative grounds to

4

uphold the opinion of the First Circuit below.

5

is that the Eleventh Amendment applies only to the

6

protection of the state fisk and therefore the question of

7

sovereignty is clearly raised.

8

balancing test that we urge upon the Court is something

9

which the Court is inclined to adopt, it need not even

The first

On the other hand if the

10

reach in this instance the question of sovereignty,

11

because if it is not the state itself, it is not the

12

sovereign itself with which we are dealing, then all of

13

the grand notions and implications of sovereignty which

14

the petitioner has attempted to thrust upon the Court need

15

not be dealt with here.

16

The reason is clear that as the Court looks at

17

this balancing test of the protection of sovereignty on

18

the one hand and the interests of preserving limited

19

Federal jurisdiction as set forth in Congress in section

20

1291, then as you get further and further away from the

21

state sovereign itself and towards some entity which has

22

been created by it, a creature which has been created by

23

it, you'd need not reach the question of sovereignty at

24

all.

argument, and I don't say we shouldn't be, but why

2

shouldn't we just remand and ask the First Circuit to

3

decide whether this instrumentality deserves to be treated

4

like the state?
MR. SIPKINS:

5

That is precisely the relief which

6

the petitioners have asked for, and what that would

7

require is that - QUESTION:

8

9

But don't you think the First Circuit

assumed that it was?
MR. SIPKINS:

10

No.

In fact to the contrary, and

11

contrary to the statement made by counsel for the

12

petitioner upon a question I believe asked by Justice,

13

Chief Justice Rehnquist.

14

its position here that this entity is unlikely to be held

15

as a state, as an arm of the state.

16

denying a motion for a stay pending the petition for

17

certiorari to this Court the First Circuit said that one

18

of the bases for denying that request for a stay was that

19

it continued to harbor substantial doubts that this

20

entity, that this sewer company was indeed an arm of the

21

state.

22

with respect to the case cited --

In its decision

So the First Circuit didn't act on this issue only

The First Circuit has reiterated

MR. SIPKINS:

1

Well, it did differ, as counsel

2

for petitioner suggests, from at the time I believe four

3

and now perhaps up to as many as eight.

4

with all due respect, Justice White, that it in fact upon

5

a careful reading of those circuits does not differ from

6

them.

7

decided the case of Mitchell v. Forsyth, a qualified

8

immunity case involving the attorney general of the United

9

States, and the issues there on qualified immunity had to

But I suggest,

Several years ago, several terms ago this Court

10

do with both the attorney general's immunity from suit

11

with respect to actions that he took as a prosecutor and

12

also with respect to actions that the attorney general

13

took in investigatory capacities.

14

And in that case this Court held that if the

15

ability to claim qualified immunity could not be

16

determined as a matter of law but it was necessary to take

17

factual evidence and to decide on the basis of that

18

factual evidence how the attorney general was acting, that

19

qualified immunity did not lie.

20

Following Mitchell v. Forsyth four or five of

21

the circuit courts that have determined the question about

22

Eleventh Amendment have held that only where immunity,

23

sovereign immunity can be determined as a matter of law,

24

where it is the state itself that can be determined as a

25

matter of law, should Eleventh Amendment immunity lie, and

1

that the protections of Eleventh Amendment should not lie

2

where it is necessary to make factual determinations.
QUESTION:

3

So your balancing test that you're

4

urging upon us, Mr. Sipkins, would say that if the state

5

eo nomine so to speak is a party it may, it might be

6

entitled to qualified, rather to immediate appeal if its

7

Eleventh Amendment claim is turned down, but an entity

8

that claims to be like the state, like the petitioner

9

here, would not be?

10

MR. SIPKINS:

11

QUESTION:

12

But if the state itself is a party it

seems to me it will never be turned down.

13

MR. SIPKINS:

15

That is correct.

Correct.

Then of course --

So that you're really giving

absolutely nothing away.

the Texas Department of Corrections, or in any number of

state qua state or the state itself.

MR. SIPKINS:

It's not a question of as a matter

8

of law here because the petitioner itself has raised

9

issues of fact that are still open and have not yet been

10

decided.

For example, it suggests, Justice Scalia, that

11

one of the reasons upon which it can claim that it is an

12

arm of the state and entitled to the protections of the

13

Eleventh Amendment is because the judgment sought by the

14

respondent is so large that it will be forced to go back

get funds to satisfy the judgment.

QUESTION:

Nothing can be determined as a matter

of law without some factual content, it seems to me.
MR. SIPKINS:

I don't believe, Justice Scalia,

20

that the question ought to be whether there are facts that

21

are in issue.

22

be factual determinations made that can't be determined or

23

can't be made until the conclusion of trial.

25

It ought to be whether that there need to

Let me point by way of example to two recent
decisions of the First Circuit involving the Ports

Authority of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

In one of

2

the cases, the H/V Manhattan Prince case, which proceeded

3

to trial, the First Circuit reversed the holding of the

4

trial court and found indeed that in that instance

5

involving pilots and the licensing of pilots for the

6

harbors of San Juan, that the Ports Authority was acting

7

in a state capacity and that therefore it was entitled to

8

claim Eleventh Amendment immunity.

9

and the development of facts during trial that assisted

That was after trial

10

the entity in proving, so to speak, that it was entitled

11

to Eleventh Amendment protection.

12

2 years later, in August of this year, in a case

13

entitled Royal Caribbean v. the Ports Authority, the

14

Eleventh, the First Circuit found that the Eleventh

15

Amendment did not apply to that very same, very same

16

Puerto Rican public corporation.

17

factually determinative in the sense that you need to

18

determine what it is that the public corporation is

19

engaged in in order to determine whether it is acting as

20

an arm of the state.

21

QUESTION:

And so the question is

Mr. Sipkins, the court of appeals

22

though decided that Cohen just didn't apply and treated

23

the case as though Puerto Rico itself was before it.

24

MR. SIPKINS:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct, it did.

And that's the issue that we, I

thought we were addressing here, and we don't need to say

2

that the, that this instrumentality is the state.

3

suppose we could disagree with you on the appealability

4

issue and remand to the court of appeals to decide an

5

issue that it didn't decide.

6

MR. SIPKINS:

7

QUESTION:

I

I believe, Justice White, that --

And so - - but you suggest that we

8

don't even decide the appealability issue but just remand

9

to decide the instrumentality issue?
MR. SIPKINS:

10

I believe that on its face this

11

Court can determine that there are open questions of fact

12

and that it was not necessary to permit an interlocutory

13

appeal from the First Circuit with respect to this

14

instrumentality.

15

QUESTION:

But for what it's worth, those open

16

issues of fact are not in any way, at least that I

17

understand, implicated by the issues raised by the suit.

18

I mean, whether you overcharged them or whether you didn't

19

overcharge them is not going to, I presume, involve

20

litigation about their status for Eleventh Amendment

21

purposes.

22

be litigated now?

23

So what is to be gained by saying it shouldn't

MR. SIPKINS:

What is to be gained, Justice

24

Souter, is that we will not know whether or not PRASA has

25

finally exhausted its arguments that it is an arm of the

state until we are able to determine precisely how large

2

any judgment that might obtain is.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Sipkins --

4

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Sipkins, do you propose that we

I don't want to proceed.

6

apply this new approach to the other areas of entitlement

7

to interlocutory appeal as well?

8

don't do this, this balancing that you propose, this

9

inquiry into whether there are any factual issues

I mean, we certainly

10

involved, we don't do it in the double jeopardy area, do

11

we?

12

MR. SIPKINS:

13

Scalia, you don't do it where --

14
15

QUESTION:

No, you're correct. Justice

We don't do it for the speech and

debate clause.

16

MR. SIPKINS:

You don't do it there, and you

17

don't do it in those instances where the Constitution

18

itself is clear that there is an absolute right not to go

19

to trial.

20

QUESTION:

So ultimately even this argument

21

collapses back into your first argument that there is no,

22

no categorical Eleventh Amendment immunity.

23

MR. SIPKINS:

24

QUESTION:

25

That there is no --

I mean, if I think this is an

Eleventh, that the Eleventh Amendment is like the speech

1

or debate clause or the double jeopardy clause, that it

2

entitles the state to stay out of the court, I don't see

3

any reason to treat this any different from the way we

4

treat claims under those clauses.

5

MR. SIPKINS:

It collapses into the essence of

6

the Eleventh Amendment and whether or not sovereign

7

immunity is the basis for the Eleventh Amendment on the

8

issue of when the state itself is the defendant or when

9

the state or a state department or agency is the state

10

defendant, but not so where it is something that is so far

11

extended from the sovereign itself.
For the reasons which I have stated and for the

12

13

reasons set forth in the brief of the respondent we urge

14

that this Court affirm the decision of the First Circuit

15

below.

QUESTION:

17

Mr. Taranto, you have 10 minutes remaining.

18

MR. TARANTO:

19

Thank you, Mr. Sipkins.

If the Court has no further

questions I have no rebuttal.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:
