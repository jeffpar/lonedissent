ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN D. GORDON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GORDON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In enacting the Administrative Procedure Act,

11
12

Congress provided a general authorization for judicial

13

review of administrative actions.

14

act, it prescribed when and under what circumstances

15

someone who is aggrieved by an agency action may seek

16

recourse in Federal court.

17

litigant need not exhaust available administrative

18

remedies before proceeding to Federal court, unless such

19

exhaustion is expressly required by statute or by agency

20

rule.

In section 10(c) of the

Congress provided that a

21

The question presented in this case is whether,

22

notwithstanding that Congress has spoken, a Federal court

23

can impose additional exhaustion requirements and deprive

24

a litigant of judicial review under the APA because he

25

failed to pursue an administrative appeal that was not

1

required by statute nor by the agency's own regulations.

2

The answer to this question, we submit, is no.

3

The facts of this case are straightforward.

In

4

1989, HUD initiated administrative sanctions against

5

petitioners, Mr. Darby and his affiliates.

6

contested those sanctions in full conformance with HUD's

7

regulations.

8

for some 10 months through a process which included

9

discovery, a 4-day evidentiary hearing, and the submission

10

Mr. Darby

He litigated the matter before the agency

of post-hearing briefs.
Ultimately, a HUD administrative law judge

11
12

issued a lengthy written decision which upheld the

13

sanctions.

14

decision became the final agency action unless the

15

Secretary chose to review it.

16

sought such secretarial review.

17

Pursuant to HUD's regulations, the ALJ's

In this case, neither party

Mr. Darby then filed this suit in Federal

18

district court.

He challenged the sanctions on the

19

grounds that they violated the Administrative Procedure

20

Act and the Due Process Clause.

21

dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

22

The district court denied this motion and proceeded to

23

grant relief to Mr. Darby, holding that the sanctions were

24

not rationally supported by the facts and that they had

25

been imposed for forbidden punitive reasons.

The Government moved to

1

The Government appealed to the Fourth Circuit,

2

challenging only the district court's ruling on

3

exhaustion.

4

regulation providing for secretarial review of an ALJ's

5

decision required Mr. Darby to seek secretarial review as

6

a prerequisite to filing suit in Federal court.

7

The Government contended that HUD's

The Fourth Circuit rejected that contention.

8

The circuit court recognized that no statute and no

9

regulation required Mr. Darby to seek secretarial review.

10

Nonetheless, it decided that as a, quote, rule of judicial

11

administration, Mr. Darby was required to exhaust this

12

administrative remedy.

13

court ruled that the district court should have dismissed

14

his suit and left the administrative sanctions in effect.

15

QUESTION:

Since he had not done so, the

Mr. Gordon, what if your client had,

16

in fact, taken an appeal within the agency?

17

then is, I take it, that still and all, you would be able

18

to come to court and prosecute an appeal both in court and

19

before the agency.

20

MR. GORDON:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GORDON:

Your position

Simultaneously, sir?
Yes.
Justice Scalia, I believe that --

23

that under the line of decisions, including particularly

24

ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, that at the

25

point that the ALJ's decision became -- was issued, that

1

Mr. Darby had an option, and that he could have either

2

pursued and administrative appeal or proceeded to Federal

3

court.

4

QUESTION:

Why -- why is that?

Because -- I

5

mean the text of section 704 reads "whether or not there

6

has been filed."

7

MR. GORDON:

And there was an interesting line

8

of cases during the 1950's where the Federal courts, the

9

circuit courts, wrestled with whether, if you pursued an

10

administrative appeal, the time for your appeal to Federal

11

court would meanwhile expire.

12

case called Consolidated Flowers, as I recall, held that

13

you could lose your right to judicial review if you

14

pursued the administrative appeal.

15

to the contrary and ultimately the Ninth Circuit reversed

16

course.

17

The Ninth Circuit, in a

The D.C. circuit ruled

And I believe this Court has recognized ever

18

since a decision in the early sixties, CAB v. Delta

19

Airlines, that if you do pursue an administrative appeal,

20

that the agency action is, pending that appeal, not final

21

and therefore not appealable to Federal court.
QUESTION:

22

But why isn't that contrary to the

23

language of 704?

24

filed.

25

704 up to now; why don't we continue to do that?

It says whether or not there has been

What I'm saying is maybe we've been playing with

MR. GORDON:

1

Justice Scalia, I would submit that

2

that is simply a practical and common-sense application or

3

construction of the statutory provision.

4

QUESTION:

Well, because it would -- it would

5

seem ridiculous to be prosecuting an appeal both before

6

the agency and here, right.

7

MR. GORDON:

8

QUESTION:

9

Simultaneously, yes, sir.
Yeah, but couldn't a court consider

it ridiculous for you to come complaining to the courts

10

when you haven't completed complaining to the agency?

11

isn't -- why couldn't I consider that ridiculous too and

12

say I certainly don't want to interpret 704 to provide for

13

that?

14

MR. GORDON:

Why

Well, the Court is not writing on a

15

clean slate here.

16

principle is that it is for Congress to prescribe the

17

jurisdiction of the Federal courts.

18

recognized repeatedly, and as recently as last term in

19

McCarthy v. Madigan, that when Congress has prescribed

20

that jurisdiction, that Federal courts are not to decline

21

such jurisdiction on exhaustion principles unless it's

22

consistent with the expressed intent of Congress.

23

It seems to us that the fundamental

And this Court has

final, whether or not there has been lodged an appeal
within the agency.

But you tell me that if there has been

lodged an appeal within the agency, we will not consider
it final, despite the language of 704, right?
MR. GORDON:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
The Government is arguing, well, this

is just another extension of the same principle.
MR. GORDON:

I disagree, Your Honor.

The

Congress, if one examines the final sentence of section
704 which is what is at issue here, has clearly dealt with
the issue of exhaustion, and not simply finality as the
Government contends.
QUESTION:

The final sentence -Well exhaustion and finality aren't

the same thing, are they?
MR. GORDON:

No, Justice O'Connor, they are not.

They are closely related.
QUESTION:

So I don't see how 704 deals with

exhaustion at all.
MR. GORDON:

If I may, Your Honor, the first

sentence of section 704 clearly imposes the finality
requirement.

The second section -- sentence of the

section provides that intermediate rulings, or procedural
or preliminary rulings, are not directly appealable, but
may be heard when the final agency action is appealed.
The third sentence, which is what's at issue

1

here, presupposes final agency action and goes on to

2

address whether there are additional procedural

3

requirements that a litigant must follow.

4

that there are -- that it is clear that this provision

5

deals with exhaustion and not simply the finality.
QUESTION:

6

We would submit

Well, it certainly isn't clear to me,

7

because all it talks about is finality.

8

thought that 704 simply doesn't address exhaustion.

9

MR. GORDON:

And I would have

I believe that there are -- beyond

10

the construction of the provision itself, that the

11

sentence, Justice O'Connor, we submit, would be

12

superfluous and inexplicable if it deals simply with

13

finality.

14

out in the first sentence.

15

The finality requirement is already clearly set

Moreover, in the legislative history, and in

16

particular in a -- a explanation of the APA that the

17

Justice Department did, and which was provided to Congress

18

at the time it was considering the APA, the Justice

19

Department said explicitly that the last sentence of

20

section 10(c) dealt with the issue of exhaustion.

21

that legislative history is quoted in our brief.

22

QUESTION:

And

Well, Mr. Gordon, the opening clause

23

of the last sentence, what you're talking about, says

24

except as otherwise required by statute, agency action

25

otherwise final is final for the purposes of this section.

1

That is surely dealing with finality.

2

in so many words and it says nothing about exhaustion.

3

MR. GORDON:

I mean it says so

Mr. Chief Justice, when it

4

speaks -- it uses the word finality twice.

5

as otherwise provided by statute, agency action that is

6

otherwise final is final for purposes of this section.

7

And that phrase, "final for purposes of this section,"

8

that is the same thing as saying it is reviewable, because

9

in the first sentence the Congress said it's reviewable.
QUESTION:

10

Well, I don't agree with you.

11

should we read it that way?

12

in so many words.
MR. GORDON:

13

It says except

Why

It certainly doesn't say so

Well, among other things, 5 years

14

ago in Bowen v. Massachusetts, the Court stated that the

15

primary thrust of section 704 was to codify the exhaustion

16

requirement.
QUESTION:

17
18
19

That was just an offhand remark in

that case.
MR. GORDON:

I agree that it was dictum, sir,

20

but not -- I believe it was the correct interpretation.

21

It's consistent with the legislative history.

22

consistent with the interpretation that scholars have

23

placed on this uniformly, including, most particularly,

24

Professor Davis in his text, and also other commentators

25

in various law reviews that we've cited in our briefs to
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

It is also

the Court.
The view that has been expressed uniformly is
that that sentence deals with exhaustion of administrative
remedies.

It is true, and Professor Davis and this Court

in Bowen have noted, that the courts have tended to ignore
that sentence in many decisions, but that doesn't change
the fact that that is what's being addressed there.
QUESTION:

Well, let's just assume that the --

that 704 deals with finality.

But it does deal with

finality and it says that -- it seems to say that -- that
there was final agency action here.

Now, is there a time

limit on when you can resort to the courts to review a
agency --a final agency action?
MR. GORDON:

Justice White, I'm not aware of any

specific time limit under the APA for filing suit once you
do have final agency action.
QUESTION:

And so it might be final for purpose

of going to court, unless.

Well, it'd still be final for

the purpose of going to court, but you might -- may be
barred from going to court by the exhaustion principle.
That's the argument on the other side, is it, I guess.
MR. GORDON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And the

difficulty we have with the Government's position is that
it turns section 10(c) into a trap for the unwary
litigant.

The exhaustion requirements must be consistent
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

with the will of Congress.
Congress, in the last sentence, has said that
you -- has said, in section 704, you must have final
agency action in order to seek judicial review.

It says

that if you've got -- whether or not you have that action,
it deals specifically with an administrative appeal.

And

it says that you don't need to pursue that appeal in order
to have finality, which it defines as the prerequisite for
judicial review, unless you are expressly required to do
so by statute or by agency rule.
It insists, therefore, on clear procedural
ground rules that are spelled out in advance.

And what

the Government has done here is come in and sought to
obtain through litigation what it never got through rule
making.
There is no statute, that's agreed.

There is no

regulation, it's agreed, that requires a litigant to
pursue this appeal to the Secretary.

And yet the Fourth

Circuit said, propounding a rule that was completely
inconsistent with -- with existing law, that there is this
hidden requirement that it has been a rule of judicial
administration that you must exhaust all available
administrative routes.
QUESTION:
this.

Well, Mr. Gordon, let me ask you

Suppose we think that 704 deals with finality, not
12

1

exhaustion, and that courts do retain the equitable

2

discretion to decide to require exhaustion in a given

3

case; would your argument then go to whether the court

4

properly exercised that discretion?

5

MR. GORDON:

6

QUESTION:

7

10

MR. GORDON:

Your Honor, I -- the question

presented in the cert petition dealt with whether or not
Congress has disposed of the issue in section 10(c).

11
12

And if so, is that question here or

would the court have to send it back for that inquiry?

8
9

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

And suppose we disagree with you on

that?

13

MR. GORDON:

I don't believe that it would be

14

necessary to return the case to the Fourth Circuit,

15

although we'd certainly be prepared, if that was the

16

Court's view of the appropriate procedural device, to do

17

it.

18

Even if section 704 dealt only with finality,

19

which we do not agree with, it is at a minimum an

20

expression of congressional intent and purpose in the

21

area.

22

degrees in conflict with what Congress has indicated

23

there, we believe would be completely inconsistent and at

24

odds with this Court's jurisprudence saying that courts

25

must defer to -- be careful to search for congressional

And to impose an exhaustion requirement that is 180

intent in the area and to follow it, and not to impose an
exhaustion requirement unless it is clearly consistent
with what Congress wanted.
QUESTION:

Suppose -- I suppose you get relief

from an agency action sometimes by appealing to the court
of appeals, don't you, from some agency?
MR. GORDON:
QUESTION:
MR. GORDON:
QUESTION:

Under some statutes.
Under some statutes.
Yes, Justice White.
Well, suppose the agency in that

situation had exactly this kind of a nonrequired appeal to
the Secretary, and yet the agency order would be final
just like it is here.

Is there a time limit, usually, to

go to the court of appeals?
MR. GORDON:

Justice White, I'm not aware of any

provision under the APA that would permit an appeal
directly to the court of appeals.

I believe that any

appeals directly to the court of appeals would be under
other statutory schemes, and therefore outside the context
of the APA, and I do not know whether there are normally
time limits that are imposed in those statutes.
QUESTION:

But how do you know, in those cases,

when an agency action is final?
MR. GORDON:

If those are separate statutory

schemes, they wouldn't be controlled by the APA.

1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

We are

1

not contending that section 704 governs exhaustion of

2

administrative remedies in review contexts that are

3

outside the APA.

4

QUESTION:

I take it that you have to, under

5

your view, even wait for 30 days before you can go to

6

court, to determine whether or not the Secretary is going

7

to appeal.
MR. GORDON:

8

9

Actually, Justice Kennedy, I

believe it would be 15 days.

Under the HUD's regulations,

10

the parties have 15 days to petition for secretarial

11

review.

12

15-day period, and therefore at that point we believe that

13

it became final.

14

In this case, neither side petitioned within the

QUESTION:

If there had been a petition, in your

15

view what would then be the posture of the case, so far as

16

judicial review, if the Secretary -- if the Department had

17

petitioned the Secretary for the Secretary to review?

18

MR. GORDON:

That's a very interesting question,

19

if I may.

If we had had the normal situation where the --

20

or I shouldn't --a situation where the sanctions were not

21

in effect until there was a final decision and the

22

sanctions were going to be stayed pending secretarial

23

review, clearly we would not have a final agency decision

24

that could be appealed to Federal court pending the

25

secretarial review.

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The interesting twist that you have in the

1

2

administrative sanction context, the suspension debarment

3

context here, is that the sanctions are effective, are in

4

effect during the period that you're litigating before the

5

agency.

6

distinction between this circumstance, for example, and

7

the one presented in FTC v. Standard Oil, where this Court

8

has held that simply filing an administrative complaint is

9

not, in and of itself, appealable final agency action.

And therefore, I think that that is a crucial

QUESTION:

10

Would the sanctions have remained in

11

effect, I take it, if the agency had petitioned to the

12

Secretary for review?

13

MR. GORDON:

The LDP would have.

You get into

14

some technicalities.

15

have been effective until the secretarial was completed.

16

But there was -- there were simultaneous sanctions here,

17

and there was a limited denial of participation that had

18

been in effect from day 1 and remained in effect

19

throughout the administration -- the litigation before the

20

agency.

21

QUESTION:

The debarment did not -- would not

And I take it, the agency could

22

appeal to the Secretary to impose a more severe sentence

23

or more severe sanction.

24
25

MR. GORDON:

Yes, sir.

In fact, the agency had

sought an indefinite term of debarment.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
1111 FOURTEENTH STREET, N.W.
SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005
(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The ALJ had

1

granted them only 18 months, so they had not gotten the

2

period that they'd asked for, and therefore they would

3

have had a basis for asking for a heightened sanction.

4

QUESTION:

But I take it even under your view,

5

the regulated party could not avoid the possibility of the

6

Department appealing to the Secretary by rushing into

7

court, because you have to wait for that 15-day period.

8

MR. GORDON:

That's correct, Your Honor.

9

And we have noted, also, that the Government has

10

suggested that to follow our position and construction of

11

10(c) would invite sort of piecemeal, haphazard judicial

12

review.

13

and we have cited a variety of other doctrines that we

14

believe give the courts full power to keep appropriate

15

control over litigants who would rush into court

16

prematurely.

17

And we don't believe that that's the case at all,

And those include the doctrine of ripeness, the

18

doctrine of finality, the requirement that in order to

19

have -- when you're seeking review under the APA, that

20

your record is limited to the record you've created before

21

the administrative agency itself.

22

QUESTION:

Well, what about the Government's

23

argument, as I understand it, Mr. Gordon, that you may --

24

if you adopt your position, a litigant can obtain judicial

25

review before getting a fully fleshed out decision from

conceded, with respect to ripeness and primary

Congress added that proviso, the doctrine of exhaustion of
administrative remedies, like the other doctrines I've
mentioned, are plainly encompassed within the terms

grounds.
QUESTION:

And where before this -- before '76,

where did you find the exhaustion doctrine in the statute?
Were we just plain wrong in the Bowen opinion saying we
thought it'd been codified in 10(c)?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well,

I think -- the Bowen opinion

was addressed to a different question, a different part.

Was that statement

just plain wrong?
MR. FELDMAN:

No.

Actually, I think the --

insofar as - - insofar as it's -- I think it was not a full
statement - QUESTION:

We said in that sentence that we

codified the exhaustion doctrine.

You're

telling me that's wrong; the exhaustion doctrine was in
some other part of the statute or somewhere up in the sky.
MR. FELDMAN:

I think it was in 702 at that

time.

MR. FELDMAN:

say there was a footnote in Bowen which I think states our
position precisely.
said,

On page 902 in footnote 35, the Court

"It is certainly arguable that by enacting section

704," that's 10(c),

"Congress merely meant to ensure that

judicial review would be limited to final agency actions
and to those nonfinal" -QUESTION:

Which is entirely consistent with the

notion that the exhaustion doctrine determined when an
action was final.
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, that -- that would be --

It wouldn't be final until there was

exhaustion.
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

Well, that would be --

So that's entirely consistent with

the text on the next page.
MR. FELDMAN:

I think that would be - - that

would be an additional premise.

But our position is that

the exhaustion -- that finality and exhaustion are
distinct doctrines.

The Court has referred to them as

distinct doctrines on a number of occasions.

The Court

did it last - QUESTION:

And the exhaustion doctrine is

entirely nonstatutory.
MR. FELDMAN:

Yes.

amending the statute, plainly thought that exhaustion, as
well as these other doctrines, still applied.

There's

nothing unusual - QUESTION:

Of course, that language would still

have exactly the same meaning if the exhaustion doctrine
were part of 70(c) -- 10(c).
MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

I don't see --

The amendment in '76 didn't take away

any defenses that were already in the books, including the
requirement of finality.
MR. FELDMAN:

Well for -- the amendment -- the

legislative -- the reports and so on which explicated that
phrase specifically mentioned exhaustion, as well as a
number of other doctrines.
QUESTION:

But it didn't -- did it mention

exhaustion as something separate from what was in 10(c)?
MR. FELDMAN:

No, but -- no, but it talked about

traditional, equitable limitations and traditional
defense.

Under 10 -- under petitioner's view in this

case, it's hard for me to see how -- what remains of the
exhaustion doctrine after 10(c).

There's now a codified

rule that no longer governs.

QUESTION:

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

If the agency so provides by rule.
That's right.

presented by this --by this case.

But I think it is an

equitable doctrine, and the Court has repeatedly said you
look at all the circumstances.

There may be cases in

which there was a trap for the unwary, where -QUESTION:

Well, like in this case.

I mean it

certainly came as a surprise to the litigant here,
apparently, that exhaustion would be required.

I think it

would come as a surprise to me, reading the statutory
scheme.
MR. FELDMAN:

I think, actually, I would, with

respect, differ with -- on that.

I think that a seasoned

litigant before an administrative agency shouldn't be
surprised to know that he has to follow an internal
appeals process that can -- especially up through an
agency's ranks, before he can go to court.

I think that

has been an accepted rule, that people would be surprised
to find they didn't have to follow.
QUESTION:

Well, would it have been an abuse of

discretion for the district court to entertain this
action?
MR. FELDMAN:

I think that if -- if a district

court found -- let me add one other fact, and then I can
answer that, which is petitioner has never claimed, that
I'm aware of in this litigation, that he wasn't aware of
the internal appeals process.

But if you take a case,

for instance, where --

where a -- where a litigant honestly wasn't aware of the
existence of an administrative appeal process, I think
that would be a factor to be taken into consideration in
the equitable weighing that - - that happens when you apply
the doctrine.
QUESTION:

But, the more you make it equitable

and discretionary, Mr. Feldman,

it strikes me the more

likely it may be a trap for the unwary.

I mean if you

don't know until you get to court how a judge is going to
decide as to whether you should have exhausted that last
remedy,

then the doctrine really does have some potential

for mischief.

MR. FELDMAN:

that that is the - - that is the consequence of having an

but so are animal and dog different concepts, but one is a
subspecies of the other.
Why isn't exhaustion one sort of lack of
finality; it's not final because you haven't exhausted
your administrative remedies?

Why isn't that a perfectly

way to explain why exhaustion is different from finality,
but nonetheless makes sense of section 704?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I think section 704 serves a

different purpose, or this last sentence of section 704.
What that does is it permits a litigant -- it permits an
agency to create a role saying you have to take this
internal agency appeal.

And regardless -- and then at

that point.
QUESTION:

No, but that -- that's --

MR. FELDMAN:
QUESTION:

That is a pre --

That's not what the APA was meant --

the APA was sponsored by the American Bar Association to
stop these newfangled agencies from jerking people around,
and the purpose of 704 was -- was explicitly to stop
agencies from making you go through one hoop after another
hoop after another hoop before you could get to court.
Isn't that the purpose of it?

MR. FELDMAN:

10

That's right.

That's the -- but

11

that is a standard application of the exhaustion doctrine

which always has had the effect of barring people from

going to court if there is an alternative administrative

remedy.

This case, in fact, is a very -QUESTION:

Well, 704 seems to say that if you

the action is meanwhile inoperative, so it isn't final.

MR. FELDMAN:

As I said, an agency -- an agency

factors might be, or the exceptions to the doctrine of

QUESTION:

But what had happened was --

But there -- but there was a

disqualification from it.
MR. FELDMAN:

There was a limited denial of

participation which was issued by the local -- a local HUD
office which had a very limited effect.

It applied to

just the local office and just the program that Mr. Darby
was involved in.

That took effect at -- before, even, the

notice of proposed debarment went out, and that was simply
a means for the agency to protect itself while anything
else was being litigated.
To say if we suspect someone of having defrauded
us or swindled us. or however you characterize what they
suspected happened.

If we suspect somebody of doing that,

we need a way to protect ourselves while --we can't just
let this person go on and contract in the same program
with us, until we can find out the facts and figure out
what happened.
That -- the rationale for that, for limited
denial of participation, is different, very different,
from that of a debarment.

And we could discuss whether

that's a good idea or whether an agency ought to be able
to -- permitted to do that, but if that limited denial of
participation is sufficient to permit a litigant to go

directly into court, then he doesn't have to wait for
anything.

That happened actually even before the

debarment proceedings had started here.
I mean, in fact, I think that that's a
reasonable way -- that serves the purpose of protecting an
agency's particular program while a debarment is being
considered.

QUESTION:

Right.

And that's what was codified in

this -- you don't think so.
MR. FELDMAN:

I don't believe it.

I think

that's actually a codification of the exhaustion doctrine.
More, if you look at cases such as Aircraft & Diesel
against Hirsch, that was a case where someone went to the
renegotiation board, had a ruling against them, and
instead of pursuing the -- what is very comparable to what
happened here, which is an appeal to the tax court in that
case, but to a superior authority, it went directly into
court to complain about the administrative action.
This Court held that that was barred by the
exhaustion doctrine.

In fact, it was barred by the

exhaustion doctrine regardless of whether he could ever
have gotten an appeal from the tax court judgment in that,
had he won it.

QUESTION:

I had thought sometimes that -- that

where exhaustion applies, a court in which a suit is filed
would just stay its hand until the administrative remedy
is exhausted.
MR. FELDMAN:

That would -- I think that would

be -- in appropriate circumstances, that would be an

Except for the time limit.

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

If there's no

reason to do it, it might not, although I'm aware that
HUD, perhaps in an appropriate case, could provide for an
extension of the time.
Thank you.

MR. GORDON:

I'd like to address several points,

2

if I may.

The first is what I believe to be the

3

absolutely erroneous contention that the Government has

4

advanced that the decision of the Fourth Circuit here was

5

consistent with the existing law of exhaustion.

6

The law of exhaustion, from the time of Meyers

7

v. Bethlehem Steel up through this Court's decision last

8

term in McCarthy v. Madigan, has always been that

9

litigants are required to exhaust the prescribed

10

administrative remedy, and that phrase "prescribed" is

11

critical and it has always been there.

12

all that section 10(c) of the APA did was to ordain which

13

remedies would be considered prescribed for purposes of

14

judicial review.

And in our view,

Moreover, the law had always been that litigants

15
16

need not exhaust permissive administrative appeals.

17

Levers v. Anderson, decided by this Court a year before

18

the APA was passed, Justice Black, writing for the

19

Court -- precisely this contention was made.

20

Government stood up and said that the litigant was out of

21

luck because they hadn't pursued a permissive motion for

22

reconsideration.

23

was not persuaded that "may" means "must,"

24

In

The

And Justice Black said that the Court

And yet that's what we hear from the Government,

25

"may" means "must."

And if you, as the litigant, if

you're sufficiently seasoned, if you can't figure that
out, shame on you.

That is nothing less than turning

these administrative appeals into traps for the unwary,
which was completely at odds with what Congress set out to
do.
The - - I would note - QUESTION:

Do you know any cases, Mr. Gordon, in

which the concept of finality was applied to failure to
seek an appeal within the agency?

Say it's not final

because you've failed to seek an appeal.
MR. GORDON:
QUESTION:

No, Justice Scalia, I do not, sir.
Yeah, I don't either.

MR. GORDON:

I would also -- on the facts here,

the Government has pooh-poohed the notion that the LDP,
which was in effect throughout, had much of an impact on
Mr. Darby.

The record reflects, and this is in an

affidavit filed before the district court, that during the
10 months that he'd already been under the sanctions, he
had lost a HUD contract that he anticipated would have
been worth approximately a half a million dollars of
profit to his business.

So this is a litigant who

diligently did everything that HUD told him to do pursuant
to its regulations at the same time he was enduring a
tremendous cost for doing so.
And the Government suggests that there was

little cost in him being required to jump through further
hoops.

If the additional 75 days for the secretarial

appeal -- and that's under an optimistic time frame -- had
gone by, the LDP could have expired, because it's limited
to a year, and according to the Government in its
pleadings before this Court, once it expires it becomes a
moot issue because it doesn't have the continuing
consequences that a debarment does.
So the Government propounds, in our view,
nothing less than a catch 22 here, and we don't believe
that the exhaustion doctrine is a catch 22 or should be
construed by this Court to place litigants in that
position.
If there are no questions from the Court, that
concludes my presentation.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Gordon.

The case is submitted.

above-entitled matter was submitted.)
