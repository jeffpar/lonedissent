ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY K. FORD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. FORD:

Thank

you,Mr. Chief

Justice,

and may

it please the Court:
This case presents two questions regarding the

12

manner in which a State court must proceed in order to

13

uphold a death sentence that has been based in part on an

14

unconstitutionally vague, catchall kind of aggravating

15

circumstance.

16

The particularaggravating circumstance here

in

17

issue is one that the Court has seen before in the Walton

18

and Jeffers case, and it makes it sufficient and both

19

includes as a factor to be weighed in the balance of death

20

sentencing that the crime was "especially heinous,

21

or depraved".

22

The Court held in the Walton case,

cruel,

I think a

23

that the language of

24

that statute alone was constitutionallyinsufficient under

Godfrey v. Georgia, but the Court alsoheld

that the

1

Arizona Supreme Court had provided a limiting construction

2

that it had applied in those cases, the Walton and Jeffers

3

cases, to narrow the application of that aggravating

4

circumstance sufficiently to survive the tests of Godfrey

5

and Maynard.
This case arose in the Arizona Supreme Court,

6

7

actually the second time.

The first time that the

8

petitioner was sentenced to death, it was under a

9

mandatory type of or a limiting type of a statute with

10

regard to mitigating circumstances, and there was a

11

resentencing.

12

the Arizona Supreme Court was at a point where it was

13

divided over what Godfrey v. Georgia had actually

14

required.

15

and the circumstances that presents the issues to this

16

case -- in this case.

When it came up after that resentencing,

That division is really what created the issues

The Arizona Supreme Court decision in that case,

17
18

which was a 1983 decision, consisted of two two-justice

19

pluralities.

20

opinion as the "majority," although it is only two of the

21

five Arizona Supreme Court Justices who joined in that

22

opinion.

23

exactly what the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals did in

24

the Maynard case at really a very similar time in history

25

and a very similar time in the evolution of the law in

1

this area.

2

They looked at what they had said previously

3

about this aggravating circumstance, principally using

4

some language from a case called Dixon v. State that was

5

decided way back in 1974 in Florida, which was kind of the

6

seminal source of a dictionary definition for these terms,

7

and it looked at a case it had just recently decided where

8

it had provided what ultimately the Court in Walton and

9

Jeffers found was the limiting construction of this

10

statute.

11

But then instead of saying - -

12

QUESTION:

That was the Gretzler case?

13

MR. FORD:

That is the Gretzler case, Your

14

Honor, and it does -- was, of course, argued very strongly

15

by the Arizona Attorney General in Walton, that that was

16

the limiting definition that was applied here.

17

And what happened in this case though was that

18

there was really a difference of opinion, I think, among

19

the Arizona Justices as to what they had to do with that

20

Gretzler categorization, and the "majority" opinion, the

21

lead opinion of Justices Hays and Holohan, treated it as,

22

I think, a set of examples that could be compared to this

23

case, almost really identically.

24
25

I looked back at Cartwright v. State, the
decision from the Oklahoma Criminal Appeals that gave rise

1

to Maynard v. Cartwright, and they --a very, very similar

2

thing was done there, where the Oklahoma Court of Criminal

3

Appeals looked at the facts of a number of cases and said,

4

well, there's a bunch of similarities to the facts of this

5

case and those cases, and we think that this is also

6

heinous, atrocious, and cruel, which was the language

7

there.

8

Court said that was not sufficient, that you could not

9

simply use the entire gestalt, the entire circumstances of

10

a case and compare them on that kind of a gross basis, and

11

that that would not satisfy Godfrey v. Georgia.

And Justice White's unanimous opinion for the

That I think is what essentially the majority

12

13

justices did here, and, in fact, the two-justice

14

concurrence.

15

Arizona Supreme Court held that that was what they were

16

doing, and that what they were doing was a violation of

17

Godfrey.

18

And actually the real majority of the

So, we have a very odd kind of a jurisprudential

19

situation here where a majority of the Arizona Supreme

20

Court, that is, the concurring opinion plus the dissenting

21

justice, said that the "majority," the two-justice

22

plurality, was in constitutional error for exactly the

23

reason that we are submitting they are in constitutional

24

error, and I think ultimately prevailed as a matter of

25

Arizona law.

1

What happened subsequently was that the position

2

of those three justices, the two-justice concurrence and

3

the one-justice dissent, who said we cannot use these

4

categories this way, we cannot simply describe the facts

5

of the case or expand these definitions to include

6

anything that includes a gruesome scene.

this Court held in Walton, has adhered to those limiting

QUESTION:

Mr. Ford, I'm curious.

Was Rebecca

Corella ever prosecuted?
MR. FORD:

Rebecca Corella was never prosecuted,

15

either for this crime, Justice Blackmun, or for the other

16

homicide in which she testified that Mr. Richmond

17

committed and the defense said no, she had committed, and

18

the jury acquitted Mr. Richmond, apparently at least

19

having a doubt as to the facts there.

20

never prosecuted for any crime, to my knowledge.

Ms. Corella was

21

QUESTION:

Do you know why?

22

MR. FORD:

I -- well, we alleged at one point,

23

Your Honor, that there was discrimination in this case on

24

the basis of race and gender.

25

although we have not been able to get a hearing on that

We still feel that,

under McCleskey v. Kemp.
QUESTION:

Maybe your opponent will comment on

that question.

4

MR. FORD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Well, under Lewis and Jeffers, isn't

6

the test whether or not, assuming Gretzler is a

7

constitutional definition --

8

MR. FORD:

Yes, Your Honor.

9

QUESTION:

--a rational fact finder could -- in

10

this case it would be the Supreme Court on reweighing - - a

11

rational fact finder determine that the standard was met?

12

MR. FORD:

Well, I think --

13

QUESTION:

Because in Maynard we were announcing

14

what the standard would be, so the gross comparison of

15

cases was inappropriate.

16

The Supreme Court knows the standard.

17

Jeffers says the test is whether or not a rational fact

18

finder, a rational reviewer, could reach this conclusion.

19

MR. FORD:

Here Gretzler is the standard.
So, Lewis and

Well, that's what the Ninth Circuit

20

in the alternative said.

But, you know, I looked back at

21

Justice O'Connor's opinion in Jeffers the other night, and

22

it is very explicit that the test is a three-part and not

23

a two-part test.

Second, was it applied in this case?

MR. FORD:

Prong two, that the plurality, the

then.

4

"majority," did not apply Gretzler as a limiting

5

definition.

6

did not find either -- well, they didn't even purport to

7

find gratuitous violence.

8

violence at some point, but they never say, we find

9

gratuitous violence.

They used it as a set of examples, but they

They talk about gratuitous

Nor do they ever say, we find what

10

had been previously been described as "needless

11

mutilation".

12

They, at the end of their description of the

13

facts, say we find a ghastly mutilation, but the

14

difference between "needless" and "ghastly" was critical

15

to the purpose of Gretzler, what Gretzler was describing,

16

which was the defendant doing something beyond the

17

homicide that showed a more culpable mental state.

18

And here there was nothing.

The mutilation, the

19

horrible scene that was left at the end of this homicide,

20

was, by both versions of the events, an accident.

21

something that had not been planned by either Mr. Corella

22

or Mr. Richmond when they were trying to flee from the

23

scene, according to both Faith Erwin's testimony and Mr.

24

Richmond's spontaneous statement to the police, which we

25

think is by far the most credible version of the events

QUESTION:

A weighing State.

3

MR. FORD:

It is a weighing State, and the

4

Arizona Supreme Court has said that.

we have is just April of this year, but I think they said

6

it many, many times before.

7

QUESTION:

The most recent cite

Well, why should we decide any -- if

8

that's the case -- if we agreed with that, why wouldn't we

9

just remand and say to the court of appeals, this is not a

10

weighing State?

11

MR. FORD:

Well --

QUESTION:

This is a weighing State.

Now,

decide it on that basis.
MR. FORD:

Well, I think that that would be one

15

possible disposition.

16

the language in the court of appeals decision on the other

17

point which seems to skip this second step, which seems to

18

say as -- that if you do have a limiting construction,

19

then you go directly to Jackson and determine whether --

20

and they actually use the language -- whether any rational

21

fact finder could sentence this person to death, and they

22

don't focus on that second step.

23

QUESTION:

We would still have a concern about

Yes, but that second step is wholly

24

irrelevant to them in terms of their rationale in

25

dismissing.

MR. FORD:

1

They give two grounds, and so if

2

either ground is incorrect, we submit, and I think the

State agrees, this case has to go back.

I guess for the Court is how much direction it should go

back with.

grounds, we would submit the Court may want to give

7

direction on both grounds.

Since we believe that it is wrong on both

Well, did the -- did the State court

decide clearly that it was a weighing State after the
court of appeals decision, or before?

11

MR. FORD:

They had - -

Or both?

13

MR. FORD:

Both.

14

Many times before, and in this

case and after.

16

And the question

QUESTION:

Well, how did the -- how did the

court of appeals fall into this error?

17

MR. FORD:

I frankly don't --

18

QUESTION:

Did the Attorney General of the State

19

concede it was a weighing State before the court of

20

appeals?

21

MR. FORD:

I cannot remember that occurring,

22

Your Honor.

The Attorney General did argue Zant v.

23

Stephens for a number of -- on a number of occasions, and

24

which would imply that there would be no difference out of

25

a weighing State.

And, of course, Your Honor's opinion in

1

the Clemons case and the subsequent decision in Stringer

2

made it clear that that wasn't right.

3

been a shorthand version of the problem.

4

So, that may have

But the Ninth Circuit clearly I think was

5

incorrect with regard to this, and the Arizona Supreme

6

Court has adhered constantly to the position that they do

7

consider the sufficiency of mitigation by weighing it

8

against statutory aggravation and statutory aggravation

9

only.

And that has been the construction of the statute I

10

think quite consistently, even since 1977 I guess, when

11

the first decisions in this statute came down.

12

would agree that that is a sufficient, and the narrowest

13

perhaps, ground for a reversal and sending this case back

14

to the Ninth Circuit.

15

So, I

But we are also concerned about this other

16

rationale which was argued and is still being argued, I

17

think, in this -- in Arizona cases, that really cuts out

18

the Jeffers analysis, and says once you have a

19

construction announced in one case, then it's Federal

20

hands off and we don't even look to see if the

21

construction is being followed or applied in a given case.

22

And I think the Jeffers decision was very explicit that

23

that had to happen, and, of course, that was the essence

24

of Godfrey v. Georgia.

25

In Godfrey v. Georgia, the Georgia Supreme Court

had adopted a limiting definition of its outrageously and

2

(inaudible) vile aggravating circumstance prior to Mr.

3

Godfrey's case, but simply did not apply it to the facts

4

of Mr. Godfrey's case.

5

problem we have here.

And that is, I think, the same

Because of this disagreement about whether

6

7

Gretzler was a limiting construction or simply a catalogue

8

of examples, the -- it was not applied as a limiting

9

construction, and we had a circumstance where -- and

10

that's why we emphasize the question of who the driver was

11

-- the "majority" was willing to extend heinousness, and,

12

of course, everyone agreed, all five justices agreed there

13

was no cruelty because there was no suffering.

14

this person was knocked unconscious and then accidentally

15

run over, according to both witnesses.

16

no -- but the heinousness they were willing to extend not

17

only to a situation where the gruesome scene was

18

inadvertently caused or not planned by the defendant, but

19

also where --or anyone else, but also where he had not

20

even personally been responsible for it, or might not have

21

been, which they acknowledged was quite possible from the

evidence in this case, because this was a felony murder

case.

And that's what Justice Cameron pointed out, and

11

I think that Justice Holohan and Hays did not dispute that

really no one could say beyond a reasonable doubt, as the

State is really saying for the first time in this Court in

14

my knowledge anywhere in the history of this case, that

15

there was some kind of an intent to mutilate, and that

16

somehow some person sat back and thought, we're going to

mutilate this person.

QUESTION:

So, we have a jury finding that at

least once the person was run over intentionally.
MR. FORD:

No.

Jury finding is explicit that

4

even if it was accidental, it did not matter.

The

5

instruction -- I believe it's in our brief --on felony

6

murder in Arizona is if the person dies, even

7

accidentally, as a result of -- in the course or

8

furtherance of a robbery, that that is first-degree

9

murder, and it's on page 8 of our brief.

Whether the

10

killing is intentional, unintentional, or accidental, it's

11

still first-degree murder in the State of Arizona.

12

And really, this case was first charged as a

13

premeditated murder, but then premeditation was stricken

14

by the trial judge at the State's request.

15

beginning of this case it was a felony murder, and I think

16

that Justice Holohan's opinion on the Enmund issue, which

17

was very much an issue in this case, reflects that.

18

From the

But what Justice Holohan did, as the Ninth

19

Circuit pointed out, was quite intuitively, I guess, or he

20

forecast what this Court did in the Tison case, and really

21

treat the major participation in a highly dangerous felony

22

as equivalent to intent.

23

at the trial level or by the jury or by the judge, and I

24

think really no finding of intent in this sense of

25

intentional running over by the "majority."

But there's no finding of intent

In fact, they say even if he wasn't the driver,

even if, I guess, everything that he says is true, which

is Rebecca Corella got in, could not operate the car

they drove off --

The jury returned a

You wouldn't expect there to be

It's an odd situation.

the jury on premeditated murder.

that it didn't have to agree as to any particular kind of

murder, and felony murder was the emphasis of the

arguments on both sides.

MR. FORD:

That's correct.

But the case was prosecuted -- and the 1976

7

opinion I think makes it most clear - - as a felony murder

8

from the beginning, and I think that that's what we have

9

to focus on, and I think that's what the dissenting judges

10

in the Ninth Circuit focused on in addressing the

11

extraordinary and extreme nature of the expansion of the

heinousness, aggravating circumstance.

You think that -- how does one review

traditionally is not a -- not interrogatories?

MR. FORD:

It's just

Well, that was a problem, of course,

11

until the Griffin decision from this Court last year,

12

where the Court said if there's two theories and the

13

challenge to one of them is unsupported, it is not going

14

to be accepted under Stromberg because we will assume that

the jury took the more rational one.

QUESTION:

jury findings.
MR. FORD:

Well, some -- now you do.

Of course,

21

in Arizona you have, I think, some unanimity requirements

22

on felony versus premeditated murder, but -- and also

So, you have a

But in the -- under a straight --

3

QUESTION:

4

when we're talking about them.

5

MR. FORD:

6

and the -- Mr. Chief Justice.

7

is that here we have really something that is quite

8

different from what not only the law of Arizona, but this

9

Court's cases have required since.

You certainly didn't at this time

That's correct, Justice Rehnquist,
I'm sorry.

And the problem

And the concern we

10

have systemically -- and I guess perhaps answering Justice

11

White's question -- to go beyond maybe the narrowest

12

possible issue in the case, is that if this result is

13

affirmed, then the body of law the Court has I think

14

really quite clarified recently in Stringer, in Clemons,

15

and those cases, is going to start to unravel as we say,

16

well, these things that were not consistent with those

17

cases are still permissible.

18

And -- but to answer your original question, in

19

the ordinary felony versus premeditated murder, Schad v.

20

Arizona kind of situation, Griffin says if either of those

21

prongs is supported and there's a general verdict, that's

22

okay.

23

adhered to, and that's why we can't, I think, apply

24

Jackson because nobody ever says -- if the Arizona Supreme

25

Court majority had ever said, we find needless mutilation

Here, though, we don't have any of those prongs

1

of this body, then Jackson would click in, but they

2

didn't.

3

They changed the Gretzler standard to fit this

4

case, and that, I think, is fundamentally inconsistent

5

with what the Court allowed in Walton and Jeffers, where

6

they applied literally the exact categories of Gretzler as

7

limiting definitions, established in advance, applied to

8

this case, and in which they continued to apply those

9

after those decisions as a consistent pattern of law

10

designed to get the arbitrariness and irregularity out of

11

capital sentencing.

12

Here we have a single event where not even a

13

majority of the Arizona Supreme Court Justices agree that

14

even in this one case the facts are met out - - are made

15

out, and there's nothing that purports to ever be created

16

as a category or limiting definition that can apply here

17

and that would apply generally.

18

It has not been done.

And so I think we have an unusual set of facts

19

that arose on an unusual occasion, and as a result has

20

created, I think, some great strains in which both the

21

district court again and the court of appeals applied very

22

different tests to affirm, and now the State itself has

23

acknowledged that the court of appeals decision was

24

incorrect as a matter of Arizona law.

answer to this.

Do you concede that your first point on

the heinous issue would no longer exist if we concluded

3

that the majority opinion and the trial court concluded

that your client was the driver of the car?

5

MR. FORD:

No,

QUESTION:

That wouldn't be enough to satisfy.

7

MR. FORD:

Right.

I think not, Justice Scalia.

I mean,

for instance,

in the

8

Maynard case, where it was clear that the person was the

9

killer and had done horrible things,

the Court said you

10

still have to apply a limiting construction and not just

11

look at all the facts of the case.
QUESTION:

12

You require some different language

13

in the opinion of the Court.

14

MR. FORD:

Is that it?

We require a statement that says, we

have construed this in Gretzler and this fits this

category we pointed to in Gretzler, and that's it.

17

what Clemons requires, and it's all Clemons requires.

have actually gone and mutilated bodies afterwards and

MR. FORD:

That's true.

QUESTION:

If they had written the opinion and

think quite properly, that "mutilation" was referring to

the standard that they'd set forth three sentences before.

MR. FORD:

Perhaps so.

were -- I think that it was forthcoming.

I don't think

it's a dishonest opinion.

reflects a difference of opinion that Justice Cameron's

expanding this to apply to every case that leaves a bloody

The point is, or the point of

In Lewis v. Jeffers, this Court held that it was

over the shoulders of the State courts and determine de

17

construction to an admittedly vague aggravating

circumstance.

19

This Court noted in Jeffers that even if the

State court misapplied the State's limiting construction,

21

that such error was merely an error of State law and was

22

not cognizable in a habeas corpus proceeding.

Today Richmond asked this Court to go beyond the

stated purpose of Jeffers, to look at the Arizona Supreme

That is correct.

QUESTION:

They just didn't do it -- they just

disagreed with the application.
MR. MCMURDIE:

Right.

That is correct, Your

10

Honor.

They specifically state in their opinion that the

11

majority -- the two, had found the circumstance based on

12

two criteria, and they disagreed that the facts were

13

present to have the circumstance exist.
QUESTION:

15

Well, what about the dissenting

judge?
MR. MCMURDIE:

16

The dissenting judge again, in

17

his independent review, simply weighed what he believed

18

were the two aggravating factors, and he simply gave more

19

weight to the mitigation.

That's correct.

Well, why shouldn't it be ignored

when three out of the five say it should be ignored?
MR. MCMURDIE:

This Court has never held that a

minority position on an aggravating circumstance cannot be

weighed when that sentencer determines or is to balance

elements of an offense that they must unanimously be found

MR. MCMURDIE:

Could you point me in the record, in

If

1

there is not a finding that he drove the car, do you think

that the record would adequately support, as a matter of

Federal law, the aggravating circumstance?

4

MR. MCMURDIE:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MCMURDIE:

You do.
Because the Federal court under

7

Jeffers is to review the evidence in the light most

8

favorable to supporting that factor.

9

QUESTION:

Well, let me go one step further.

10

Supposing there is a finding that he did not drive the

11

car, then would you say that it was sufficient as a matter

12

of Federal law?

13

J

Yes.

MR. MCMURDIE:

I think the presumptions change

14

if there had been express finding by the Arizona Supreme

15

Court that he did not drive the car, but that was not made

16

in this case.

17

QUESTION:

Well, I understand, but do you think

18

the record would be sufficient if it were clear in a

19

finding to that effect that he did not drive the car?

20

MR. MCMURDIE:

I think the presumption would

21

change, and therefore if there was a record that the

22

Federal court could not go beyond what was specifically

23

found by the State court.

For the Enmund/Tison issue, but

cases, it would require him to be the driver of the car.

Well, at least the Arizona Supreme
