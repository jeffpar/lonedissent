CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

the United States.

Mr. Stewart.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID 0. STEWART

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We challenge in this case Senate Impeachment

10
11

Rule XI, under which the Senate failed to conduct the

12

impeachment trial of Walter Nixon when it removed him as

13

Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the

14

Southern District of Mississippi.

15

The constitutional requirement of a Senate

16

impeachment trial means that the accused must have the

17

opportunity to present his case, to present witnesses and

18

to confront witnesses against him before the duly convened

19

Senate, which requires the presence of a quorum of the

20

Senators.

21

Under Impeachment Rule XI, however, the trial

22

occurred in this case only before a committee of 12

23

Senators which required a quorum of only 7.

24
25

The impeachment trial requirement is important,
because it ensures to the greatest extent possible -3

QUESTION:

before 12 Senators.

-- I suppose when you call it a trial

MR. STEWART:

Well, Your Honor, we do think that

4

the proceeding that anyone comfortable with judicial

5

proceedings would identify as the trial did in fact occur

6

before the committee, and indeed, if you look at Rule

QUESTION:

Well, that's what the case is all

about, I suppose.

10

MR. STEWART:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. STEWART:

It is indeed.

Yes, all right.
The Impeachment Trial Clause

13

ensures that the Senate will approach the cases and

14

exercise its ultimate power to remove executive and

15

judicial officers with great care and deliberation.

QUESTION:

the Impeachment Trial Clause.

19

just as well refer to it as the sole power clause.

20

Well, Mr. Stewart, you refer to it as

MR. STEWART:

It says the Senate shall

Well, Your Honor, that certainly

21

has been the position of respondents, that that is the

22

only - - that word sole is the only relevant word in the

23

passage, and that word cuts off all review by the courts,

24

but I think that that reading of that word hangs such a

25

tremendous amount on that word that it's really not

QUESTION:

Well, I -- you know, certainly that

would be a fairly partial way to refer to it.

call it the Impeachment Trial Clause is an equally partial

5

way to refer to it.

You're entitled to do it, certainly.

MR. STEWART:

6

I think to

I'm not trying to be partial here,

Your Honor, I am simply trying to demonstrate -- to

8

describe it -- it does seem to describe an impeachment

trial.

QUESTION:

You can be partial.

going to be partial, too.

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

15

MR. STEWART:

The other side's

That's the system we have here.

Fair enough.
It's all right.

But there are several elements

16

that the trial and other elements of the Constitution

17

require a limited -- that limit the power of the Senate in

18

conducting these impeachments.

19

removal, the exercise of this ultimate power, can only be

20

when there's proof of an offense -- a high crime or

21

misdemeanor, treason, or bribery -- and a conviction must

22

be based, in the words of the Federalist Papers, on a real

23

demonstration of innocence or guilt.

24
25

The Framers insisted that

Another element by which they tried to control
the impeachment and removal power was by providing a two5

1

thirds majority had to be present, and another element we

2

think is very important here and brings us here today is

3

that the Senate must conduct the impeachment trial acting

4

in judicial character as a court.

5

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Stewart, do you think the

6

high crimes and misdemeanors language is such that the

7

interpretation by this Court could supersede that of the

8

Senate?

9

position where he had been removed from office but instead

In other words, supposing your client were in a

10

of claiming that the trial requirement that you see there

11

had not been met, he said he was not guilty of anything

12

that could be called a high crime or misdemeanor.

13

MR. STEWART:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that

14

could be reviewable, and that the Court has to face up to

15

that.

16

think that would be reviewable here, and maybe it would be

17

useful for me to address directly the question of sole

18

power and the question of reviewability, which we think

19

really the respondents have hung so much on.

20

It's not presented here, of course, but yes, we do

An ordinary reading of the clause - - the Senate

21

shall have the sole power to try impeachments -- sole

22

would simply describe the fact that the Senate has the

23

power to try the case, and no other forum has the power to

24

try the case, and that --

25

QUESTION:

What would the language have meant,

1

in your view, if the word sole were not there, if it

2

simply said the Senate shall have the power to try all

3

impeachments ?

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, of course, that's the way

5

the clause was written as it was initially approved, and

6

it was only in the Committee of Style that the word sole

7

was adopted.

8

determine trial procedures.

9

It means that the Senate has the power to

Admission of evidence, there are lots of

10

elements of a Senate trial that do not resemble a court

11

trial.

12

Senate has refused to have a standard of proof, and we

13

don't think that would be reviewable, but what does remain

14

reviewable is whether there was a trial at all.

15

For example, there's no standard of proof.

QUESTION:

The

Well, would it be reviewable, in your

16

view, if a quorum was not present at all times, and could

17

a Senator vote ultimately who had not heard all of the

18

evidence, in your view?

19

asking the Court to get into?
MR. STEWART:

20

I mean, what are you getting --

Your Honor, those are two

21

different questions, I think, and let me try to answer

22

them separately.
The question whether a Senator could vote

23
24

without having heard all the evidence, my answer to that

25

is yes.

All that's required is that there be a quorum

present, and that by definition means you could have as

2

many as 49 Senators not present and those Senators might

3

well vote.

4

excused from voting if they didn't hear the evidence, but

5

there's no constitutional issue presented.

Many Senators in the past have asked to be

Your initial question, though, was is there a

6

7

problem if there as not a quorum present, and my answer to

8

that, I think, has to be yes, that that would be the

9

Senate was not duly constituted.

If it is in the record

10

that the Senate was not duly constituted and the Senate

11

recklessly went ahead with the trial anyway over the

12

objection of the accused, that would in fact be

13

reviewable.

14

held before the Senate.

There you would have no trial actually being

QUESTION:

15

But you think it is a trial if people

16

who haven't been present at the proceedings come in and

17

vote.

21

You consider that a trial.
MR. STEWART:

It is a Senate trial as provided

in the Constitution, yes.
QUESTION:

A Senate trial is --

I don't know how you're drawing the

line between the one and the other.

22

MR. STEWART:

23

QUESTION:

If you look at - -

I thought a trial means you present

24

evidence before someone who then decides, the person to

25

whom the evidence has been presented.

You say that's not

1

what a trial is.
MR. STEWART:

2

I have no problem with the

3

proposition that the Framers intended all Senators to be

4

present, but what they provided in the text of the

5

Constitution is that the Senate can conduct its business

6

with a quorum present.

7

Impeachment Trial Clause to try the case, then it need

only have a quorum present.

QUESTION:

You say a quorum present during the

right?

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

13

If the Senate is then in that

point is,

Yes, sir.

But it can be a different -- your

it can be a different quorum.

14

MR. STEWART:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

One portion of the Senate can hear

16

the evidence, and another portion vote, and that's a

17

trial.

MR. STEWART:

Surely undesirable from a point of

citizenship - -

think it's a trial.

I know it's undesirable.

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

But yes.

I don't

Yes.

What about this Court,

if we exercise

24

original jurisdiction and appoint a master, and we don't

all sit there and hear the evidence.

Have we conducted a

2

trial that fails to meet the Constitution?
MR. STEWART:

Those proceedings do not resemble

3

an impeachment proceeding to the extent that they involve

4

stripping an individual of rights.

5

there is a statutory provision --

6

QUESTION:

In that kind of case

Oh, well, I think they could involve

7

a great many rights -- water rights, or one thing and

8

another -- that are terribly important.

9

MR. STEWART:

But there is no provision in the

10

Constitution that provides that the trial must be before

11

this Court in those cases.

12

be applicable, I think, would be the Seventh Amendment

13

which might well, when you had an individual present,

14

provide a right to a jury, and indeed there is a statute

15

that provides for a jury trial right in those

16

circumstances in this Court.

17

used for many years, but there is that right.

18

QUESTION:

The only provision that would

Of course, it hasn't been

What would you do if the Senate did

not allow the accused official to face and confront the

20

witnesses against him?

completely understand the question.

be

2

QUESTION:

3

they're testifying.

4

And you can't be in the room when

MR. STEWART:

To answer the first question, you

5

can't cross-examine the witnesses, we state that the

6

irreducible requirement of the trial is the opportunity to

7

present your case, present your witnesses, and confront

8

the witnesses against you, so there would be a right of

9

cross-examination, and you could pose that hypothetical

10

where there is no right of cross-examination, and I would

11

say that is not a trial, but if the issue were one of the

12

scope of cross-examination, that would be one confined to

13

the discretion of the Senate.

14

QUESTION:

What is the standard?

If you can

15

refer to a word in the Constitution to resolve the issue,

16

then we have jurisdiction, is that about the way it goes?

17

MR. STEWART:

There has to be a specific

18

requirement in the Constitution, and I draw this from

19

Baker and Carr and also from Powell v. McCormack.
If there is a specific requirement like the two-

20
21

thirds majority vote, like the requirement that the House

22

impeach officers before they face trial in the Senate, if

23

there is that specific requirement, then that is a

24

justiciable question, and that's one that the courts have

25

to decide.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Stewart, in both the trial of

2

Samuel Chase and the trial of Andrew Johnson there was a

3

great deal of motion being made and demands made for

4

continuance on the part of the defendants, and the Senate

5

insisted in both cases that they be brought to trial much

6

more rapidly than would be conceivable in an ordinary

7

criminal case.

8

10 days to prepare.

9

You know, they were given something like

Is that something that would be reviewable as an

10

incident of a trial if the claim were made that we simply

11

did not have a fair opportunity to prepare?
MR. STEWART:

12

No, sir, and in those instances as

13

I recall the case was extended for a substantial period of

14

time and there certainly was an opportunity to prepare,

15

but no, I do not think that would be reviewable.

16

QUESTION:

Well, would you say that if you're

17

going to be divested of the office of associate justice or

18

of President that 10 days was sufficient to prepare?

19

MR. STEWART:

No, I would not, an interestingly,

20

I think the Framers imposing the Trial Clause were very

21

wise to impose the Trial Clause, because when you're

22

dealing with the chief justice or a justice of the Supreme

23

Court or the President, there is a political attention to

24

this which I think will slow down the process in most

25

instances.

You point out instances where it didn't, but in

1

2

fact there were partisans for those individuals who

3

attempted to support them and defend their rights.

4

you're dealing with a lower court judge you don't have

5

those protections.
QUESTION:

6

When

So you would read the Trial Clause

7

differently if you're dealing with a lower court judge

8

than if you're dealing with some highly visible official?

9

MR. STEWART:

I don't mean to say that, Your

10

Honor, no.

11

the importance of the trial when you're dealing with a

12

lower court judge.

13

What I mean to say is, it simply highlights

QUESTION:

You rest your argument on the

14

assumption that the meaning of the word trial is clear.

15

Would your position be the same if we conclude that the

16

meaning of the word trial in this context is ambiguous?

17

MR. STEWART:

Your Honor, I think to rule in our

18

favor the Court has to conclude that the word try does

19

have meaning and the meaning is as we say that there is an

20

irreducible requirement of an opportunity to present your

21

case and confront your case, and that meaning I don't

22

think is so elusive when you compare the impeachment

23

clause to other clauses of the Constitution creating

24

powers for the Senate -- for example, the power to be the

25

judge of elections.

That doesn't have any element of
13

1

confronting witnesses or presenting witnesses.

2

simply a requirement of a decision.

3

That's

In this instance, though, try means something

4

else, and I think respondent's position, in order to rule

5

for them you really have to say that try is the same as be

6

the judge as, and when you look at the history, when the

7

first Senate, which included Framers, had to apply both of

8

these provisions when they were applying the Elections

9

Clause they had evidentiary proceedings before committees,

10

but when they were applying the Impeachment Clause, when

11

they were conducting impeachment trials they did those

12

before the Senate.

13

That was the common sense understanding of the

14

time, and I think that case casts an important light on

15

the question before the Court here.

16

QUESTION:

All right, but if we should disagree

17

with you about the clarity of meaning, do I understand you

18

correctly to concede that the case should - - and we

19

conclude that the word is ambiguous, do I understand you

20

correctly to concede that the case should be decided just

21

as it would be as if we were dealing with an issue which

22

the Constitution did not expressly address in any way?

23

In other words, we would defer by a conclusion

24

of nonjusticiability to the Senate to make the

25

determination and leave it where it is.

MR. STEWART:

1

Your Honor, I think we would lose.

2

I'm not exactly comfortable as to whether that is a

3

nonjusticiable question or simply we would lose on the

4

merits.

5
6

QUESTION:

But that's the least of your

concerns.

7

MR. STEWART:

8

QUESTION:

Okay.

9

QUESTION:

Is this part of your argument, that

10
11

Yes, sir.

the issue is justiciable?
MR. STEWART:

Yes, it is, and I'd be happy to

12

address it, because it seems to me that justiciability, as

13

I was saying earlier, hangs so much on the word sole.

14

reasonable reading of the word sole is that it means

15

simply that the Senate has the power to try the case and

16

no other forum does.

17

A

It's not that the word excludes judicial review.

18

If the Framers intended to exclude judicial review of

19

impeachments, why not do so?

20

judicial power shall extend to all cases arising under the

21

Constitution except impeachments?

22

the Pardon Clause.

23

presidential power to pardon shall extend to all cases

24

except cases of impeachment.

25

Why not say that the

That's what they did in

The Pardon Clause says that the

Well, the Framers didn't do that, and that seems

1

very persuasive to us in two respects.

2

clearly did not choose to exclude judicial review,

3

therefore the ordinary presumption of judicial review, the

4

power of this Court to say what the law is, applies, but

5

by the same token when they didn't accept this notion that

6

impeachment trial is this island, unreachable by any other

7

entity, that they recognized unless they excluded the

8

President from exercising pardon power, well then, he

9

would have the power to exercise - - to pardon individuals

10

First, they

who had been impeached and convicted.
QUESTION:

11

Could the accused official waive the

12

right that you claim is his?

13

this is very complicated testimony and I want Senators who

14

can focus on the testimony, and the Senate says we'll have

15

the evidence presented before a committee of 15 Senators,

16

and he wants that, can he do that and then refer the

17

matter to the whole Senate?
MR. STEWART:

18

Suppose an official says

Absolutely.

I think any

19

individual can waive a constitutional right, and I think

20

in fact - -

21

QUESTION:

But if you were a Senator I take it

22

you would stand up on the floor of the Senate and say I

23

must point out that this is an unconstitutional

24

proceeding.

25

MR. STEWART:

If I were a Senator and I objected

1

to that because I wanted to hear the testimony, then I

2

would have the right to go listen to the testimony.

3

QUESTION:

Well, I think you'd have the

4

obligation to tell your colleagues that they are

5

proceeding in an unconstitutional manner, wouldn't you?
MR. STEWART:

6

You would have the -- you could do

7

so, but no, I don't think that that is proceeding in an

right, he certainly has the power to do so.
And indeed, when the Impeachment Rule XI was

12

adopted in 1935, the history of it clearly indicates that

13

the Senate -- many of the Senators, at least, thought that

14

this was a right only -- that could only be waived, and

15

that it could not be forced to have an impeachment accused

artificial concept, that well, the trial happened before

That is,

MR. STEWART:

1

I think it may well have been an

2

intent, but it is not expressed, and moreover there is no

right to assert except in the case of an individual, that

4

the States cannot assert a Seventh Amendment right to a

jury trial.

QUESTION:

How about an ambassador?

MR. STEWART:

QUESTION:

then, in your view.

An ambassador is not an individual,

MR. STEWART:

10

I don't believe so.

Your Honor, I would have to review

11

the Seventh Amendment again, but I don't think that is the

12

intent behind that provision.

13

Let me also comment, though, there is an

14

important problem also with respondent's position with

15

respect to this -- how you read the word try, whether

16

there is content in the word try, because if there is no

17

content in the word try, there is no stopping point to

18

their position.
Then it's okay to have the trial before a

19
20

committee.

Then it's okay to have the trial before a

21

single Senator, or it's okay, as the Senate argued below,

22

to have simply a paper trial where you just introduce a

23

transcript and have the Senate vote, and that begins to

24

look very much like a proceeding that the framers

25

expressly rejected.

Pennsylvania protested that this would make judges subject

this be a true trial proceeding, and removal by address

1

Your Honor, I think that comes

2

back to the question of is it the Senate's sole power to

decide what is the content, or is it this Court's power to

say what the law is, to construe the law, and I think an

5

impeachment, just as in questions of the viability of a

this Court must exercise jurisdiction, just review the

there are no judiciable standards to apply.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH W. STARR

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MR. STARR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

5

Rule XI of the United States Senate was adopted

6

in 1935.

That rule permits but it does not require the

7

appointment of a committee for a limited function of

8

gathering evidence, and in crafting that rule the Senate

9

was responding to its own experience, because with the

10

growth in that body's responsibilities, at times evidence

11

was being presented before a virtually empty Senate

12

chamber.

13

In fashioning that rule, the Senate was

14

exercising a power that was entrusted to it by the

15

Constitution -- by Article 1, section 3, clause 6 -- which

16

vests sole power in the Senate to try all impeachments.

17
18

QUESTION:

Are the committee hearings part of

the trial?

19

MR. STARR:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.
Then I take it if the President were

21

impeached and a committee was sitting the chief justice

22

would preside over the committee.

2

3
4

of the trial, wouldn't he?
MR. STARR:

I think that is quite arguably the

case, Justice Kennedy.
I do think, by the way, that the Senate would

5

see fit not to use that procedure with respect to the

6

impeachment of a President or a justice of this Court, and

7

again, I think it's important to know where did this rule

8

come from and why?

9

It was first suggested in 1904, based on

10

experience, a sense on the part of - - a felt sense on the

11

part of Senators, some of whom had served in the House of

12

Representatives, had been impeachment managers themselves,

13

and who were sharply critical of the way in which the

14

process was now working.

15

And certainly that has been of concern to the

16

Senate since, in 1985, we had the spectacle of a United

17

States district judge who had been duly convicted of a

18

crime, that conviction had been affirmed on appeal, and a

19

suggestion had been made by the Judicial Conference of the

20

United States that impeachment might be appropriate.

21

We have had, unfortunately, three impeachments

22

in recent years, and the Senate has been concerned,

23

therefore, about the orderliness of the proceedings and

24

yet the fairness of the proceedings.

25

QUESTION:

But General Starr, when that rule was

1

adopted in 1904 according to your opponent here it was

2

contemplated that it would be voluntary on the part of the

3

person being impeached, and indeed, maybe many of them

4

would prefer to be tried by 12 Senators who were there

5

than by 100 who weren't, so one can see why that would

6

have some attraction.

7

MR. STARR:

Justice Scalia, it's fair to say

8

that the Senate was not of one mind with respect to the

9

constitutionality of Rule XI.

There were clearly some

10

Members of the Senate who thought this was improper, and I

11

think, by the way, that's one of the redeeming aspects of

12

this.

13

The Senate has taken this very seriously, has

14

examined the constitutional questions very seriously, and

15

it is true that, as Mr. Stewart has noted, that Senator

16

Ashurst, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1935

17

expressed that view, that he contemplated that it would be

18

an optional procedure, but other Senators didn't agree

19

with that, and that certainly is not what the rule itself

20

contemplates.

21

It's the judgment of the Senate as to whether

22

it's appropriate or not, and particularly given here, in

23

the modern age, where -- and this was referred to by Mr.

24

Stewart --we now live in the age where proceedings are

25

videotaped.

These were videotaped.

QUESTION:

and may not have even been necessary.
MR. STARR:

6

I think it was not necessary, but I

7

think, Justice Stevens, that clearly a majority of the

8

Senators did feel -- and I know Mr. Stewart's position is

9

that there is a constitutional right to a separate

10

proceeding that must involve a sense of what the evidence

11

was in the case, and that's the sober judgment of the

12

Senators.

13

And one of the points I would like to leave the

14

Court with today is that one of the reasons that the

15

Senate has been sober in its judgment is its sense that

this is it, this is the end of the road, this is our

MR. STARR:

The former because of the latter,

that the text itself, when we also contemplate the

structure of the Constitution and the purpose of

does satisfy, it seems to us, at a minimum two of the

criteria laid down by this Court in Baker v. Carr, a

textual commitment to the Senate.

13

Senator Heflin served on the committee, and when

the issue came, when Judge Nixon said, I want my motion

just as this Court examines as a judge in original cases

Powell said, we have this term, qualifications.

The House of Representatives has

Powell v. McCormack said, because we see that there's a

there had not been such a commitment to the Senate simply

10

MR. STARR:

You're using the term emphasis, and

11

without trying to quibble, I'm trying to say, Justice

Souter, that I am emphasizing the fact that the text

itself specifically defines what the majority is.

then it seems to me that it is part of your duty to

2

resolve that question first as opposed to saying that is

3

such a difficult question, but it's actually easy for us

4

when we move to the merits to say this is a perfectly

5

sensible procedure.

6

I do think that it is the Court's obligation to

wrestle with the judiciability question as to whether it's

appropriate for you to examine the merits of what the

Senate did.

QUESTION:

General Starr, if I understand your

theory, you're quite trial does not have a precise

12

content, but surely it has some content.

13

something that it's just not a trial.

14

to hear a whole bunch of relevant evidence because we're

15

too busy, we don't want to waste any more time.

16

that's -- is that a trial?

17

MR. STARR:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

I mean, there's

Let's say we refuse

Now,

Yes.

What if you refuse to hear to hear

19

all evidence, you just don't let the defendant put on any

20

evidence at all.

Is that a trial?

MR. STARR:

QUESTION:

Yes, it is, under -What is not a trial, in your view?

Is there anything that is not a trial?

at all because we have an automatic rule which we're going

2

to apply, because it does seem to me that the term try

3

means that you're coming to judgment, but yes, if you --

4

QUESTION:

I think it's an artificial system

5

you're setting up when you say two-thirds has a meaning

6

and chief justice shall preside has a meaning, oath or

7

affirmation has a meaning, but trial has no meaning

8

whatever.

9

it has some meaning.

10

MR. STARR:

I agree it doesn't have a precise meaning, but

I think it does -- I'm sorry, in the

11

abstract, of course it has meaning, but who's going to

12

give content to the meaning in our view is the Senate.

QUESTION:

At the margins.

any evidence.
MR. STARR:

Everybody will agree
We refuse to hear

But Justice Scalia, my point is

17

this.

18

agree with the Senate's definition, our point is it's

19

their power to decide, and even though you say, gee --

Even though you as a judge, as a justice, do not

QUESTION:

I may agree with that, but I would

21

say the same about the chief justice presiding, about the

22

two-thirds, and all the rest of it as well.

25

MR. STARR:

Well, that's fine, if you want to

view that as nonjudiciable, that's fine.

that may be the difficulty that you're having with Powell

v. McCormack as opposed to our submission.

QUESTION:

word that you say the Senate must construe, I take it then

you don't rely on sole power.

same if it said the Senate shall try.

12

MR. STARR:

Your argument would be the

Absolutely.

Absolutely.

It has

13

been entrusted to the Senate, for reasons that go beyond

14

the text and include the structure and the purpose of

15

impeachment.

16

QUESTION:

So the House could impeach saying the

judge is a bad guy and the Senate could take a vote

without any trial or anything else and say -- they

MR. STARR:

Yes.

that will not happen, and we saw that, by the way, in

QUESTION:

If the Senator is voting

That's what the Framers wanted.

They knew -- they were familiar with the caprice

of human nature and they were familiar with capricious

legislatures and they knew they couldn't control them, but

13

what they did provide was that there had to be a trial and

I think not only do I say it must

by saying it must be you when it's a two-thirds vote, and
