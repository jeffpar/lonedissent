ORAL ARGUMENT OF LYNN E. THOMAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. THOMAS:

Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case is before the Court on a petition by

12

the warden of the Idaho maximum security institution for a

13

writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals

14

for the Ninth Circuit.

15

sentencing scheme a provision that the death penalty is

16

authorized if it is proven by the state that the murder

17

was committed with utter disregard for human life.

18

Idaho has in its statutory death

The Ninth Circuit court of appeals has held that

19

this provision is unconstitutionally vague and that the

20

limiting construction imposed on it by the Supreme Court

21

of Idaho is likewise deficient.

22

Idaho Supreme Court's construction, is to the effect that

23

the utter disregard factor is to be limited by inquiring

24

into whether the killing was committed with utmost callous

25

disregard for human life, that is to say whether the

That construction, the

killer was a cold-blooded, pitiless slayer.

QUESTION:

At the outset is it, is the vagueness

issue the only question in the case?

4

MR. THOMAS:

Well, no, Your Honor, I don't think

5

the vagueness issue is the only issue in the case.

6

is also a question about whether the court of appeals

7

correctly reviewed or correctly deferred.
QUESTION:

9

There

We didn't limit the grant of

certiorari?
MR. THOMAS:

10

Yes, Your Honor, the certiorari

11

grant was limited to the vagueness question, the utter

12

disregard question.

QUESTION:

case.

MR. THOMAS:

QUESTION:

20

MR. THOMAS:

That you're going to argue.
That's correct.
All right, thank you.
The utter disregard or cold­

21

bloodedness finding in this case is supported by a

22

considerable background of murderous behavior by the

23

defendant, and by the fact that in this case he killed

24

another inmate in the state maximum security institution.

your argument can I just get one thing clear?

2

agree that unless the statutory language had been

3

construed by the Idaho Supreme Court that it would be

4

unconstitutionally vague, or do you defend the statute on

5

its face as well?

6

MR. THOMAS:

Do you

Well, no, Your Honor, I don't

7

necessarily concede that it would be facially vague, but

8

we did, when this case went to the Idaho Supreme Court for

9

the first time, suggest that the court impose on it a

10

limiting construction as to make sure that there was no

11

doubt that the factor was to be applied in the narrowest

12

kinds of circumstances.

13

concession that there is an actual facial vagueness

14

problem with it because we believe that the term utter

15

disregard for human life has the kind of content that

16

makes it possible to distinguish this kind of case from a

17

larger universe of lesser murders.

18

20

QUESTION:

But I would not make the

Does this language come out of the

model penal code?
MR. THOMAS:

No, as far as I know, Your Honor,

21

the precise language is not duplicated in any of the other

22

statutes and it, to the best of my recollection, was not a

23

model penal code suggestion.

was cold-blooded and pitiless?
MR. THOMAS:

10

I think it did.

It's not entirely

11

clear from the trial court's language, which was not

12

extensive and not very precise.

13

into account all of the things that the court said in its

14

findings, that it's talking about a conclusion that this

15

was a particularly cold-blooded killer and that had

16

something to do with all of the other murders, with the

17

pattern of murderous behavior that he had exhibited in the

18

past.

19

QUESTION:

But I think when you take

Well, I had thought that the statute

20

focused on, and this particular part of the statute, the

21

pitiless killer, really focused more on the killer's

22

conduct with respect to the slaying in question, in which

23

case the previous killings would be irrelevant.

24
25

MR. THOMAS:

I think the statute focuses on

anything that reflects a cold-blooded or particularly

2

murderous behavior.

another aggravating circumstance doesn't necessarily take

4

away from that in our view.

QUESTION:

The fact that it also establishes

Mr. Thomas, will you give us some

6

examples of first degree murders in Idaho that are not

7

cold-blooded or pitiless?

8

9

MR. THOMAS:

Well, I think that almost any

murder, Your Honor, would be, would qualify as not cold­

10

blooded or pitiless if there were any kind of emotional

11

provocation that went with it, any kind of distress, any

12

kind of justification or excuse that didn't rise to the

13

level of a legal defense.

14

the cases that the state supreme court has decided and the

15

cases that have gone before the trial courts, what you

find is that the cold-blooded factor encompasses a very

small number of cases.

circumstance.

And I think that if you look at

It's a rather rare kind of

found that.

MR. THOMAS:

The trial court I thought

There is language in connection

24

with the court's mitigation considerations, Your Honor,

25

that suggests that what the court found was that the

defendant initially, I'm sorry, the victim initially

2

provoked the attack.

3

reflects is a little different than that.

4

the trial court misspoke or used some ambiguous language

5

taken in the full context of its findings because the

6

evidence is pretty clear - -

7

QUESTION:

And what the evidence in the case
We think that

Let me just ask you this question.

8

If we took the trial court at face value would it still

9

satisfy your view of the utter disregard?

10

MR. THOMAS:

I believe it would, Your Honor,

11

although I would acknowledge that there are ambiguities in

12

the trial court's description of the case and it is not as

13

complete as we would have liked to see it.

14

is not the end of the line in our judicial sentencing

15

system because the state supreme court conducts a full

16

course of independent review of all death sentences.

17

QUESTION:

That of course

Mr. Thomas, may I just go back to

18

your answer to Justice Stevens' last question, because I'm

19

not sure why it would, why this particular sentence would

20

be consistent with your criterion.

21

you said a moment ago a murder would not qualify as

22

manifesting utter disregard if it was committed with any

23

kind of emotional provocation.

24

evidence of that, and that seems to be what the trial

25

judge found.

As I understand what

There is certainly

be consistent.

2

Can you explain that to me?

MR. THOMAS:

Yes, Your Honor.

The trial judge's

3

finding, or at least his statement that the murder was

4

committed in an excessive violent rage and that the victim

5

initially provoked the attack is very troublesome because

6

it's not entirely consistent with the evidence.

7

evidence really was that Creech arranged for the attack --

QUESTION:

The

With respect, though, I think Justice

Stevens' question was if we take the trial judge's finding

10

on its face is this particular sentence consistent with

11

your criterion.

MR. THOMAS:

Oh, I'm sorry.

I misunderstood

your question.

15

ambiguous but they do contain findings that Creech had

indicated he intended to keep on killing people, that he

was remorseless and calculating, language essentially --

Yes, it is, but for a little different

The trial judge's findings at face value are

QUESTION:

But the criterion is whether, as I

19

understand it, is whether by the murder, which I assume,

20

as Justice Kennedy was suggesting a moment ago, it means

21

this murder or circumstances surrounding its commission,

22

the defendant exhibits utter disregard.

23

how you can get beyond the record and say well, there are

24

other, of this case, for the application of your standard.

So I don't see

1

trial judge's finding by looking to circumstances having

2

nothing to do with this killing.

3

MR. THOMAS:

Well, let me in response to your

4

question, if I may, focus on one aspect of what does

5

appear in the trial court's finding, and that is that

6

after the victim was helpless and after he had been

7

completely dominated by Creech, Creech killed him at that

point.

things I think, was the nature of the particularly

Now, what the trial judge focused on, among other

10

indifferent or cold-blooded action of the defendant in

11

stomping this individual to death after he was down on the

12

floor - -

13

QUESTION:

And I can see that as a perfectly

14

relevant consideration except for one thing.

15

formulation of it was that if there is any kind of

16

emotional provocation.

17

simply requires that a provocation element be present,

18

whatever else there may be.

19

the trial judge's finding, if we accept it, that there was

20

some kind of emotional provocation, and I don't know why

21

we don't stop right there and say therefore the utter

22

disregard factor could not be applied here.

23

MR. THOMAS:

Your

Your formulation does, in effect

And it seems to me clear from

I don't think that that necessarily

accurately characterizes what the trial judge found here.

2

and not the original motivation of the defendant for

3

setting things up in this fashion.

4

key factor here when you look at the cold-bloodedness of

5

the defendant's behavior, and that is something that the

6

trial judge did not entirely explain.

7

I think that is the

But that ambiguity I think is resolved when the

8

state supreme court in the course of its independent

9

review function says that it has never seen in 50 years of

10

examining comparable cases a more remorseless, cold­

11

blooded or calculating killer than this individual.

12

think that ambiguity, if that's what it is in the trial

13

court's finding, is cured by that --

QUESTION:

So I

Mr. Thomas, the victim had a

handicap, didn't he?

16

MR. THOMAS:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. THOMAS:

That's correct, Your Honor.
What was that handicap?
He had at some time prior to his

19

imprisonment shot himself in the head with a 38 caliber

20

revolver.

21

had some plastic, cranial plastic material over the top of

22

the injured area.

23

uncoordinated, and, as Creech indicated in his confession,

the law enforcement officers wasn't able to handle himself

2

be able to put up much of a response.
QUESTION:

Didn't the trial judge or the

3

sentencing judge also find that even though the victim

4

provoked the altercation, he went on to find that with the

5

victim's attack as an excuse the defendant's murder then

6

took on the many, took on many aspects of an

7

assassination?

8

9

MR. THOMAS:

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

thin that is one of the really important factors that

10

indicates the cold-bloodedness or the focus on cold­

11

bloodedness that the trial court engaged in in its

12

consideration of the case.

13

assassination, when you talk about the victim's attack as

14

an excuse for what happened later, I think what you see is

15

that the trial court is really considering this the kind

16

of utmost callous or cold-blooded behavior that the

17

statute was intended to encompass.

18

When you talk about an

We think that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals

19

did not accurately or fully apply this Court's precedent

20

in Walton v. Arizona which has two important components.

21

One of them is that a judicial sentencing system such as

22

we have is entitled to some more deference than other

23

kinds of sentencing systems, and that the Godfrey-Maynard

24

rationale does not fully apply in those circumstances.

25

you assume that the trial court and the state supreme

If

1

court knew the law in this case, knew the requirements of

2

the Constitution and applied it, you have to reach the

3

conclusion that in this process Idaho's courts applied the

4

narrowest possible construction of the utter disregard

5

factor to the circumstances of the case rather than the

6

broadest possible factor.

7

In Walton and in some of the other cases

8

involving the analogous especially heinous, atrocious, or

9

cruel factor the courts were trying to define a word like

10

heinousness, which is much broader and less specific and

11

much more difficult to deal with in a sentencing situation

12

than the term cold-blooded.

13

state of mind, and there are lots of circumstances in

14

which courts have to deal with state of mind descriptions.

15

There are circumstances such as arise when it's necessary

16

to determine what is premeditated and what does it mean,

17

or what is malice of forethought and what does it mean,

18

what is reckless disregard and what does it mean.

19

there is nothing unusual about calling on the sentencing

20

authority to apply a moral judgment in making the

21

determination that an actor in a criminal case --

22

QUESTION:

Cold-blooded talks about a

So

Do you think the issue in the case is

23

whether or not this aggravating factor, as described or

24

narrowed by the Idaho Supreme Court, could be applied in

25

any case, or is the claim that it could not be applied to

1

any case?

2

to any, it could not be used as an aggravating factor in

3

any case no matter what the facts are?

4

Is it so vague that it just couldn't be applied

MR. THOMAS:

Yes, I believe that is what the

5

court of appeals said with this proviso, they said that

6

the factor itself was not invalid, it was just that the

7

Idaho Supreme Court's limiting construction hadn't

8

provided any more guidance than the language of the

9

statute.

10

QUESTION:

Well, all right, but and so the

11

conclusion was it couldn't be used as an aggravating

12

factor in any case?

13

MR. THOMAS:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, as limited, that's correct.
Did the court of appeals make any

V,

15

effort to see if it could be applied to this particular

16

case?

17

MR. THOMAS:

They appeared not to have done so

18

or not to have done so in a very significant fashion, Your

19

Honor, because the court simply said, like the heinousness

20

factor in Godfrey and Maynard or similar factors, the

21

limiting instruction doesn't mean anything different than

22

the statute, and they did not appear to make any --

23

QUESTION:

It was so vague, it was so vague that

there is no case that it could be applied to?

QUESTION:

2

You didn't, the state didn't take the

What the Eighth Amendment requires us to do is

13

to construct a sentencing system that is capable of

murderers which should be eligible for the death penalty

or should have the death penalty from all the others.

2

Supreme Court has used.

QUESTION:

Of course that's the very issue that

4

you've just stated, and I still have a little trouble in

5

finding murders that are not pitiless and cold-blooded in

6

Idaho, first degree murders.

7

MR. THOMAS:

That's a valid point, Your Honor.

8

You could say that all murders are pitiless and cold­

9

blooded.

However, this factor is - -

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. THOMAS:

All first degree murders.
I'm sorry, all first -- you may

12

even say that about all murders, second degree murders at

13

least.

14

that courts and judicial sentencers know and apply the

15

law, and know and apply this Court's precedents

16

interpreting the Constitution, one must I think reach the

17

conclusion that all of the courts in this process know

18

that they must apply the narrowest possible construction

19

to the aggravating factor and did so, and therefore that

20

sets what might be called, I suppose, ordinary murders

21

apart in the way this factor is used, and I think that's

22

all we're required to do under the Constitution.

However, going back once again to the assumption

factual findings again?

excuse for an assassination?

incompatible findings?

Could it make up its own mind on

the basis of the record?
MR. THOMAS:

It could indeed.

fully independent review, and that that review was to
consider factual support, the evidentiary support for the

as he did - QUESTION:

No, but why are other crimes relevant

Are you reading the utter disregard factor the

way I am, the murder refers to this murder, and

circumstances of this murder?

Are we reading this the

same way?
MR. THOMAS:

I see your point, Your Honor, and I

think we are reading it the same way, but I don't -QUESTION:

Then why should we consider the

circumstances of other crimes?
MR. THOMAS:

Well, irrespective of the nature of

the aggravating factor itself, the court is obliged to
consider all of the aspects that are there about the
defendant's character and his background and his criminal
behavior.

that Creech is carrying out, consistently with his past

Yes, it is, Your Honor.
So that it would have been relevant

for that.

MR. THOMAS:

That would be correct.
I thought that the relevance of the

contained in petitioner's reply brief and partially in

response to Justice White's question, I think it's

important to focus for a moment on a procedural aspect of

this case that hasn't yet garnered much attention.

Pursuant to several aspects of the Ninth Circuit's

decision which are not before the Court today this case

9

Thus I think the narrow issue before this Court

today, in light of the fact that the case has been

that the Osborn formulation is unconstitutional.

MR. GARDNER:

Well, Your Honor, because of the

response to Your Honor's question was somewhat too quick,

19

is that the Ninth Circuit decision can be defended on, I

20

believe on either ground, the decision on the vagueness

important element that we could decide, I suppose, is

3

whether or not the judicial gloss, et cetera, is or is not

constitutional on its face.
MR. GARDNER:

Because there will be a remand for resentencing, that is

the primary issue before the Court.

And I think --

That's the issue we limited our grant

to.
MR. GARDNER:

Well, Your Honor is correct.

The

grant of cert was limited to question 1 presented in the

petition.

14

issue was in fact whether the Osborn formulation is

15

constitutional, but with that came a number of subsidiary

16

issues, if so was it applied, was there sufficient

evidence, or was it cured on appeal.

18

point is that in light of the remand those latter three

issues I think are less important for this Court's

consideration.

The answer I

Turning then to the question of whether the

Osborn formulation adequately channels the sentencer's

5

discretion, the parties below and the Ninth Circuit, and

6

in fact the Eighth Circuit and Tenth Circuit in Newlon v.

7

Armontrout, Moore v. Clarke, and the original Cartwright

decision have all focused on the distinction between

9

subjective and objective criteria.

And while I think

10

that's a useful distinction I think in some ways with

respect to this factor, although it's accurate, it is a

12

little too broad to accurately describe the precise

13

problem with the utter --

May I interrupt you just a second?

Do you take the position that subjective factors can never

that utter disregard or that cold-blooded is subjective.

It's that if you look at the record actually before the

Court in this case you will see that cold-blooded can mean

three or four very different things, and that is the

problem with -QUESTION;

So, I mean, you're saying that they

have given so many limiting definitions that there is no

that there cannot be a valid limiting definition which is

You're not saying, now at least,

phrased in terms solely of subjective factors.

MR. GARDNER:

MR. GARDNER:

I think that's right.

Okay.
I think there are some subjective

14

factors that in fact can properly limit the sentencer's

discretion.

16

is that it is an umbrella term which incorporates several

some of those different definitions are.

In 1983 when this case was first argued to the

The case came into Federal court and before this Court and

it's now defined as a killing without emotion, without

6

Florida, of course as we know from the attorney general's

7

briefing and from all the briefing in the case, the

8

coldness factor is defined as something that we call super

premeditation, which is yet another way to describe

10

That was how it was defended in 1983.

Now there is a significant

11

And so we see in this case that that, I think,

12

is the fundamental problem with using a term like cold­

14

an umbrella term that can refer to many different

concepts.

them haven't been identified, then the, there's a real
practical side to the problem which is when you come into
court in Idaho and you have this umbrella-like definition
which contains three or four different possibilities, the
parties, the defendant and the prosecutor and indeed the
trial court who is the sentencer in Idaho, doesn't know
which of the definitions to use, if any, or all.

And so

the problem is that you may have one trial judge applying
the super premeditation factor, the parties present their
evidence and the trial court either finds utter disregard
or finds no utter disregard based on super premeditation.
You may have a trial judge in the next court room that's
applying without emotion.
And so the problem isn't that any of these
aren't valid or that all of them aren't valid, but we
don't know which ones are being used in which court rooms.

Well, but maybe you're not entitled

If all of them are valid, which is one

hypothesis you advance, then the fact that one judge may

QUESTION:

Did the Idaho Supreme Court have to

12

accept the findings of the trial court or could it

13

reexamine the whole thing de novo?

14

MR. GARDNER:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

So we don't know that the Idaho

16

Supreme Court was accepting -- I find it impossible to see

17

how you could accept both the finding that the defendant

18

used it as an intentional excuse to assassinate and the

19

finding that he was in an excessive violent rage.

20

MR. GARDNER:

21

QUESTION:

Well, the Idaho Supreme --

I think those two are quite

22

incompatible to me, so I assume that the Idaho Supreme

23

Court selected one or the other.

24

one or the other, I assume.

a de novo review.

I think if you look at the Idaho

2

Supreme Court opinion you find a similar tension because

3

they find in the same sentence both the aggravating

4

circumstances and the mitigating circumstances are

5

supported by the evidence.

6

statement that the Idaho Supreme Court makes as to these

7

findings that Your Honor has suggested are inconsistent.

And that's really the only

8

The only additional insight we can gain from the

9

Idaho Supreme Court's opinion is their observation that in

10

fact the trial court did not find that this was committed

11

by plan by Mr. Creech.

So although they may have been

12

free to, they did not.

I think that much we can glean

13

from the actual opinion.

14

QUESTION:

All of this is getting us into the

15

facts of the particular case rather than the question on

16

which we granted cert, which was whether the, whether the

aggravating factor in itself is a permissible one --

QUESTION:

I think Your Honor --

-- regardless of how it was applied

here.
MR. GARDNER:

It does go beyond the actual

language of the Osborn formulation and talks about the

23

application to this case.

24

questions on the actual application of the utter disregard

factor I would be prepared to submit it.

QUESTION:

Does Lewis v. Jeffers prohibit us

2

from looking at the way in which Idaho has applied the

3

particular definition in order to understand the meaning

4

of the definition?

5

MR. GARDNER:

6

answer would be yes, Your Honor.

7

suggested that once a limiting definition is proposed by

8

the state and if it's a valid limiting definition you

9

can't look at actually how it's applied.

I think solely looking at Lewis my
Lewis of course

That simply

10

falls under the third part, the Jackson v. Virginia,

11

whether a rational fact finder could reach the result.

12

I think, however, there is a tension between

13

that aspect of Lewis and Sochor v. Florida.

14

Florida this Court recognized that in a judge sentencing

15

state if the limiting definition is not quite up to snuff

16

you can in fact look at applications.

17

of Florida where the limiting definition that this Court

18

had approved had not been in fact used by Florida and this

19

Court looked at how it was applied.

20

QUESTION:

In Sochor v.

That was a case out

When we're passing upon the limiting

21

definition in the first instance is it then appropriate to

22

see the manner in which the court, the courts of the state

23

have applied the definition over a number of cases?

24
25

MR. GARDNER:

I think under Sochor v. Florida it

is, and certainly in a judge sentencing case it should be.

1

Trial courts are presumed to be aware not only of the

2

articulated principles that come down in cases, but I

3

assume of the applications in those very cases.

4

think it makes sense that in a judge sentencing case, as

5

Idaho is, that the cases applying the limiting definition

6

should be considered.

7

QUESTION:

MR. GARDNER:

9

QUESTION:

So I

Why?
Well, I think, Your Honor --

Do you think if you looked at a

10

series of these cases you think you could construct out of

11

the, out of the way this factor was applied a, some

12

limiting construction that would be satisfactory?

13
14
15
16
17

MR. GARDNER:

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

I

think there are two separate questions -QUESTION:

Well then why are the application

facts relevant?
MR. GARDNER:

I think that you cannot construct

18

one in this case because in fact the limiting definition

19

is not constitutionally proper.

20

constitutionally proper, perhaps you could construct, as

21

in Sochor the Court was able to construct a reasonable

22

interpretation.

23

theoretical reason why I think it's proper in a judge

24

sentencing case or a judge sentencing state to look at the

25

applications is because the court is presumed, the trial

I think were it

The reason, the more I suppose

1

courts are presumed to be aware of those applications.

2

it has at least to me some intrinsic sense to look at

3

those applications to see what a trial judge sitting in

the day-to-day rigors of his practice, or of judging, is

going to be aware of..
