CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in Number 91-1721, Northeastern Florida Chapter of the

5

Associated General Contractors of America v. the City of

Jacksonville, Florida.

Ms. Ausburn.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH A. AUSBURN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. AUSBURN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
4 years ago my clients filed an equal protection

12

challenge to an ordinance passed by the City of

13

Jacksonville, Florida.

14

Court of whether nonminority contractors who do business

15

with the City of Jacksonville have standing to challenge

16

an ordinance that excludes nonminority contractors who do

17

business with the City of Jacksonville from consideration

18

for certain city contracts.

Today, the question is before this

19

There are before this Court three --

20

QUESTION:

Ms. Ausburn, do we also have to

21

decide whether the case is moot?

22

MS. AUSBURN:

Yes, Your Honor, that issue has

23

been presented to this Court.

The -- as we discussed in

24

our briefs, the city has repealed the ordinance that was

25

originally challenged.

However, it did not simply repeal

that ordinance, it repealed it and replaced it with

2

another ordinance that for purposes of standing is

3

identical.

4

QUESTION:

Well, is it?

5

rather different, is it not?
MS. AUSBURN:

6

The new ordinance is

Your Honor, the city claims that

7

it is different in the fact that it is supported by

8

evidence that was presented to the city council before the

9

ordinance was enacted.

That, however, is not in the

10

record, and frankly we will not know until someone has

11

standing to challenge that ordinance and obtain court

12

review.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Well, in structure it's different as

well, is it not?
MS. AUSBURN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Rather than

16

being a simple set-aside which the original ordinance was,

17

this new ordinance has five different ways of granting

18

preferences along racial lines.

19

there are bid preferences, there are direct negotiations,

20

there are subcontracting requirements.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

There are set-asides,

The different --

Is it possible that the standing

analysis would be different under the new ordinance?
MS. AUSBURN:

Your Honor, it might be that in

24

some instances there would be a question of subcontracting

25

requirements of whether there were contractors who would

1

have standing to challenge the subcontracting

2

requirements, which is not an issue under the old

3

ordinance.

4

However, for purposes of the fact that

5

nonminority contractors come into the bidding process with

6

a distinct disadvantage for a certain percentage of city

7

contracts, that standing analysis would be the same

8

under - QUESTION:

9
10

anywhere down the line to address the new ordinance?
MS. AUSBURN:

11

12

No, Your Honor, the case has been

dismissed because of the standing issue.
QUESTION:

13
14

Has your complaint been amended

So as it comes to us, anyway, it was

based on an ordinance that's now repealed.
MS. AUSBURN:

15

Yes, Your Honor, although I would

16

use the word, replaced with another substantially similar

17

and, for purposes of standing, identical ordinance.
QUESTION:

18

Ms. Ausburn, our judgments don't

19

address legal issues.

I mean, I agree with you the legal

20

issue that you raise will continue to be there under the

21

new ordinance, maybe in somewhat different form, but

22

courts don't address legal issues, they issue judgments,

23

and you're essentially asking us to strike down a -- or to

24

disallow the implementation of a statute which no longer

25

exists.

You're asking us to do something that's a useless

act, aren't you?
MS. AUSBURN:

2

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

It

3

is far from clear in this case that the injunction which

4

the district court entered in this case originally almost

5

3 years ago -- it is far from clear whether that permanent

6

injunction does not cover the new ordinance.

7

The court's injunction stated that the city was

8

free to reenact constitutional ordinance that met this

9

court's guidelines in City of Richmond v. Croson.

It is

10

no more than an assertion on the part of the City of

11

Jacksonville that this new ordinance meets the city of - -

12

the guidelines of Croson and therefore meets the terms of

13

the original injunction.

14

If it were not for the standing issue, Your

15

Honor, either party could go back to the court under the

16

original injunction and ask the court to review this new

17

ordinance under the same standards and under the same

18

legal issues that were presented 4 years ago.

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. AUSBURN:

21

I see.
However, no one can do this until

someone has standing.
QUESTION:

22

All you're asking this Court to do is

23

to reverse the Eleventh Circuit on the standing question.

24

You're not asking us to decide anything on the merits, are

25

you?

MS. AUSBURN:

1

No, Your Honor.

There is nothing

2

on the merits that has been preserved in this case

3

through - - from the district court through the Eleventh

4

Circuit.

5

of the old ordinance, and the merits of the new ordinance

6

have never been challenged.

7

The Eleventh Circuit did not decide the merits

QUESTION:

And, of course, the Eleventh Circuit

8

didn't decide any questions on the adequacy of the

9

pleadings, and there was no question about your ability to

10

amend your complaint because they invoked the standing

11

rule to dismiss the action.
MS. AUSBURN:

12

Yes, Your Honor.

They invoked the

13

standing rule, ordered it dismissed on the basis that our

14

pleadings did not allege sufficient facts that they

15

believed to be required for standing in this case.
QUESTION:

16
17

Was the ordinance repealed, and then

a new one enacted, or was it just amended?

18

MS. AUSBURN:

It was repealed and replaced.

The

19

beginning of the ordinance -- I believe, Your Honor, at

20

the very beginning it said that they repealed section 6 of

21

the City of Jacksonville Purchasing Code and replaced it

22

with this following section 6, so the --a new part

23

section 6 is added to the code, I believe is the exact

24

language.

25

So the new ordinance is in exactly the same

1

place that the old one was.

It is part of the code.

It

2

uses the same statutory citations and for that purpose

3

we've argued that the case is not moot on those grounds.

4

The question upon which this Court granted

5

certiorari, which is standing and whether a group of

6

nonminority contractors have standing based on the

7

pleadings that were present in this record, there have

8

been three particular standards that have been identified

9

to this Court for determining that standing issue.

10

The first one is the rule adopted by the

11

Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which apparently no

12

party before this Court is defending any longer, and that

13

is that the contractors must identify a specific bid and a

14

specific contract that was lost due to the enactment of

15

the ordinance.

16

The second rule that was presented is the City

17

of Jacksonville's latest proposal, which is that the

18

contractors need not show that we actually lost a

19

contract, we need only show that we specifically bid for

20

an ordinance.

21

And then the third standard is that submitted by

22

petitioners in this case, which is that the statute

23

creates a racial preference that disadvantages certain

24

parties and that we are within that category of people who

25

are disadvantaged.

(800) FOR DEPO

1

We believe, Your Honors, that it is this last

2

rule is the only one that is consistent with this Court's

3

precedent in both standing and equal protection law.

4

we explained in our brief, the categorical rule which

5

petitioners would ask this Court to adopt stems from a

6

number of cases, such as Baker v. Carr, Quinn v. Millsap

7

and others, which is that the Equal Protection Clause

8

protects access, it does not protect what the Eleventh

9

Circuit asks the injury to be.

10

As

It does not protect actually getting a contract,

11

it does not protect actually being able to perform the

12

contract, the Equal Protection Clause protects access to

3

the system, and that when a party does not have complete

4

and fair access to the system, and that access is

5

conditioned on an unconstitutional barrier, that is the

6

injury, and that is sufficient injury for the Equal

7

Protection Clause.

8
9

Now, the second rule, which is the latest
version, has -- sounds more perfectly reasonable that you

20

have to identify a bid.

21

addition to the law of equal protection, or the law of

22

standing, and it is not consistent with this Court's

23

rulings in prior cases such as - -

QUESTION:
for a minute?

1

second essentially kind of an empirical difference in the

2

sense that you're claiming that by identifying the

3

contractors and the association as contractors who

4

customarily bid on a range of contracts, that you

5

therefore in effect have identified them as probably

6

harmed, whereas the second category is asking simply for a

7

more specific demonstration, or a more, maybe a heightened

8

probability of harm?

9

two?

10

Is that the difference between the

MS. AUSBURN:

It could be looked at as that

11

difference, Your Honor.

12

allegations in this case show sufficient probability.

13

have alleged that we are contractors who regularly bid on

14

and perform contracts for the City of Jacksonville, that

15

we do business with the City of Jacksonville on a regular

16

basis, that there are contracts that we would have bid for

17

but we were not eligible for --

QUESTION:

We would argue that our
We

-- in your complaint specifically

says that many of your members would have bid.
MS. AUSBURN:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe that is

in - - it is in paragraph 46 of our complaint, which is in

22

the Joint Appendix -- Joint Appendix page 18,

nonminority members of AGC have been eligible and would

have bid on contracts but for the set-aside program."

aside program is in effect, that we are shut out from

these.

3

heighten the probability, but it is the sort of mechanical

4

requirement that becomes simply a pleading requirement,

5

and - -

The requirement of a specific bid arguably would

QUESTION:

6

Well, being shut out, you don't

7

really say that being shut out is enough.

8

assume that contractors in Seattle, Washington are shut

9

out, too.

10

I mean, I

You think an individual contractor in Seattle,

Washington, could come and bring this suit?
MS. AUSBURN:

11

Only if he proved that he does

12

business with the City of Jacksonville and would like to

13

do business with the City of Jacksonville.
QUESTION:

14
15
16

So being shut out alone is not

enough.
MS. AUSBURN:

No, Your Honor.

There is some

17

requirement that you be within the group of people

18

affected by the ordinance, and the ordinance only affects

19

those people who do business with the City of

20

Jacksonville.

21

QUESTION:

But the city identifies in advance

22

the reserved -- at least under the old ordinance they

23

identified in advance the bids that were reserved.

25

MS. AUSBURN:

Yes, Your Honor, under both the

old ordinance, and I believe under the new ordinance, the

set-aside, or the contracts that are reserved are -- it is

2

included within the bid specifications that these

contracts would be let only to minority bidders.

QUESTION:

And that's -- and nonminority

contractors are shut out from bidding on those --

MS. AUSBURN:

QUESTION:

8

MS. AUSBURN:

9

Yes.

Particularly identified contracts.
Yes, Your Honor.

I suppose in a

technical sense we could bid for the contracts.

we simply

10

would not be considered, and that is, of course, one of

11

the problems with the City of Jacksonville's standard, is

12

that they are asking our contractors to bid for contracts

13

that on its face our contractors are not eligible for.

14

They are requiring a futile act in order to

15

prove standing, which this Court has held in many cases,

16

including criminal law standards, that -- to analogize to

17

criminal law, that a person need not submit themselves to

18

a threat of prosecution in order to have challenge -- in

19

order to have standing to challenge a law that

20

criminalizes some behavior unconstitutionally.

21

This Court has also held in many cases that an

22

impending injury is enough, and that if there is evidence

23

in this case or in our case allegations in the complaint

24

of an impending injury, in our case the contractors who

25

would have bid on these contracts and who would like to

1

bid on these contracts, that is precisely the sort of

2

pleading that this Court found adequate in Clemments v.

3

Fashing, which was a statute that required politicians in

4

Texas to resign from a current office in order to run from

5

another office.

6

This Court did not require those people to

7

actually go and run for office or apply to be a candidate

8

for the office.

9

allegations, which were that they would like to run and

The Court simply held that the

10

would run if it weren't for the fact that they had to

11

resign from their current office, was sufficient to give

12

them standing to challenge that resign-to-run provision.

13

QUESTION:

If you were representing just one

14

client rather than -- one contractor rather than

15

association, and the contractor was new in the business,

16

had never bid on anything whatsoever, would you think it

17

was sufficient for you simply to acclaim that your client

18

would have bid but for the set-aside?

19

MS. AUSBURN:

Your Honor, there might be a --

20

with the individual contractor there might be a heightened

21

element of evidence in order to prove that he would have

22

bid, and that would come down to the difference between

23

allegations and evidence submitted at summary judgment in

24

order to prove that.

25

QUESTION:

-- allegation.

(800) FOR DEPO

MS. AUSBURN:

1

I would believe. Your Honor, that

2

would be sufficient to establish standing and to get the

3

case - - to get the case into court so that those

4

allegations could be tested.

5

There would be all sorts of evidence required

6

that this person was competent to perform contracts for

7

the City of Jacksonville, that he was otherwise eligible;

8

there would be many issues, but those would be evidentiary

9

proof issues rather than pleadings issues for allegations.
The question of what -- whether a person would

10
11

have to submit a bid, that second test that has been

12

presented to this Court is not one that is necessary to

13

protect the principles that are at issue in standing

14

cases.

15

cases is whether you have the proper plaintiff before the

16

Court, a plaintiff who is likely to be injured, a

17

plaintiff who is concerned about what is happening in this

18

case.

19

This Court has stated that the issue in standing

We would submit that, on the basis of our

20

allegations, that we do business with the City of

21

Jacksonville, that we would like to continue to do

22

business with the City of Jacksonville, that you have the

23

proper plaintiffs before this Court.

24
25

After all, the ordinance is directed towards
contractors who do business with the City of Jacksonville,

1

and if we can prove we are within that category, then

2

there is no one else that is going to be able to challenge

3

the ordinance, other than people within that category.

4

The third rule is the one that this Court

5

originally granted cert on, which is the Eleventh Circuit

6

rule requiring proof of an actual contract.

7

that the Eleventh Circuit confused the standards for

8

standing in equal protection cases with the standards at

9

issue for a bid protest or your standard civil suit where

We believe

10

damages are sought, and for all the reasons contained in

11

our brief we believe that injunctive relief, and

12

particularly injunctive relief under the Equal Protection

13

Clause, does not require proof of a specific lost contract

14

but simply being allowed to - - or, excuse me, not being

15

considered or not being able to compete on an equal basis

16

is sufficient.

17

The finally issue that has arisen in the briefs

18

is the level of evidence that is required.

19

this case is that everything about standing has been

20

decided on the pleadings.

21

record that our clients submitted a bid and were refused,

22

or that they would have gotten a contract.

23

The posture of

There is no evidence in the

The reason we believe that this Court should

24

focus on the allegations and determine whether the

25

allegations are sufficient for standing is because in many

1

cases, this -- or in most cases where the Court has

2

focused on the -- considered standing, they have focused

3

on the allegations in the complaint unless, if standing

4

came up as an issue in the lower courts, in the issue of

5

summary judgment or in other standards, then this Court

6

has considered that the nonmoving party or the party

7

plaintiff who has proved standing has had adequate notice.

8

Celotex is an example where this Court made a

9

point that the plaintiff in that case had not presented

10

sufficient evidence to sustain her pleadings, but that she

11

had sufficient notice, and all of these cases -- many of

12

these cases that the Court has considered have used

13

language that if it is contested at trial, if the question

14

is brought up -- in Lujan, the language was, in response

15

to a motion for summary judgment evidence is needed.

16

There was no such motion, there was no such

17

notice for the petitioners in this case.

18

never came up until - - as I believe the briefs adequately

19

show, the question never came up until 6 months before

20

this case came up on appeal when the Eleventh Circuit

21

adopted its new rule and then applied it in this case.

The question

22

This Court has never dismissed pleadings or

23

never decided a case on standing for lack of evidence

24

unless there was notice in the lower courts that this has

25

come up.

In this case, the City of Jacksonville never

raised the issue.
In fact, at a hearing on the preliminary-

2

3

injunction when the judge asked them if they were claiming

4

that we had no standing, they said no.

5

and being denied for a bid went to irreparable injury for

6

a preliminary injunction, which was the issue at that time

7

4 years ago, when we sought preliminary injunction.
The issue of injury and requiring a bid has

The issue of bids

never been an issue in this case until the Eleventh
Circuit's -- the Eleventh Circuit decided its decision.
QUESTION:

11

What do you do about our language in

MS. AUSBURN:

Your Honor, the injury that this

of racial preferences and not being allowed.

7

ourselves in the Croson category as opposed to the Warth

no likelihood shown that the injury would ever occur, and

a difference in Warth between the proximity.
We look to the Equal Protection Clause not to

3

determine proximity, we simply look to the Equal

4

Protection Clause to determine the injury that is

acceptable, and that is the main area of disagreement that

6

we have with the Eleventh Circuit's argument.

7

at the only injury that is acceptable is economic injury.

QUESTION:

They looked

Well, I -- I guess that's a different

answer -- I mean, if you said that language in Warth may

go too far, but the proximity is different, that language

aside -- but that language seemed to say not just, it

12

isn't proximate enough, but that it can't be proximate

3

enough unless you will identify a particular contract.

4

MS. AUSBURN:

Yes, Your Honor, and if Warth

5

requires people who suffer Equal Protection injury to

6

prove a bid or to show that they had submitted themselves

7

to the process, then Warth is not consistent with this

8

court's prior holdings in standing and equal protection,

because there are many cases where - - the voters in Baker

QUESTION:

2

MR. MAGID:

But you've changed your mind now.
Correct.

The Eleventh Circuit --

3

the Eleventh Circuit, which has an obligation, and every

4

court -- and it's really between -- almost between the

5

plaintiff and the court.
QUESTION:

6

I don't deny their obligation, but

7

I'm just -- it doesn't seem to me to apply to them a

8

higher standard than would be necessary to pass a judgment

9

on the pleadings, when you have never at any point, until

10

they're in the court of appeals, challenged the standing,

11

and then you want us to apply the test that ought to be

12

applied either at summary judgment or later still, at

3

trial.

That doesn't seem to me very fair.
MR. MAGID:

4

They had notice, like any other

5

litigant, that standing is an essential element of their

6

case.

7

for summary judgment, they represented to the court that

8

the court should grant that judgment as a matter of law,

9

and here's all our evidence that we need.

20

They moved for summary judgment.

When they moved

Again, they had notice that standing is an

21

essential element of the case, but they did not submit any

22

evidence establishing that standing for the court to rule,

23

24

and to exercise its lawful authority in this case.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Magid,

It is without

the question

6

presented in the petition for certiorari is whether an

7

association challenging a racially exclusive Government

8

ordinance may establish standing by showing its members

9

are precluded from bidding on certain municipal contracts,

10

or whether the association must show that its members

11

actually would have received one or more of those

12

contracts.

13

That is a question of substantive standing law,

14

not pleading law, and you know, you're entitled to urge

15

affirmance on any other ground of the court of appeals,

16

but I suggest that you do discuss somewhere in your

17

30 minutes the standing question.

18

MR. MAGID:

We believe, Your Honor, that in this

19

case the Eleventh Circuit has not established a new rule

20

of standing -- has not changed anything substantively on

21

the basis of constitutional standing.

22

The Eleventh Circuit does not require litigants

23

challenging an affirmative action program or reverse

24

discrimination to show a denial of a benefit or a lost

contract.

it merely required the plaintiff,

QUESTION:

They said that in order to do that

5

they had to show that they would have successfully bid on

contracts, didn't they?

7

MR. MAGID:

Correct, and the reason the Eleventh

8

Circuit did that is because the complaint itself states

the injury as being economic, and I refer you to

10

paragraphs 48, 49, and 52.

11

were we harmed?

It says, we were harmed.

What did you lose economically?

MR. MAGID:

Well, facially on the record, Your

21

Honor, and the ordinance is the only thing we have in the

22

record, we don't have any bid specifications, and if you

look at the ordinance, the ordinance specifically has a

QUESTION:
with a question?

Mr. Magid, may I just interrupt you

Isn't it also an allegation in the case,

10

which we are taking as true at this point, that the city

11

manager, whoever it was, identified particular contracts

12

as subject to the set-aside, and that the only claim that

13

these people are making is that as to those contracts they

14

were excluded from bidding, and if that is true, then the

15

fact that there may be a waiver provision is irrelevant to

16

our issue, isn't it?

17

MR. MAGID:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Well, Your Honor -Because there was no waiver as to

those identified contracts.
MR. MAGID:

But again, the complaint does not

21

identify the particular contracts that the city might set

22

aside in the future.

23

QUESTION:

No, I -- that, I assume, is the case,

24

but you were placing some emphasis on the fact that the

25

city can waive the set-aside requirement.

1

My only point is, as I understand it,

the

2

pleadings here include a claim that there have been

3

specific contracts as identified as being subject only to

4

minority bids, and those are the only contracts which we

5

have before us, and if that is so,

could have been a waiver is irrelevant,

MR. MAGID:

the fact that there

I would submit to you, Your Honor,

that provision has to be -- that allegation should be read

in context with the evidence, which is the ordinance, and

10
11

the ordinance - QUESTION:

Well,

I'm willing to do that, and I

12

still don't see what difference it makes, and why we

13

should consider the possibility of a waiver when the

14

subject matter of this litigation goes to contracts which

MR. MAGID:

It is uncertain from the pleading in

that no particular contract is identified --

QUESTION:

No specific contract, i.e., the

contract to pave, you know, West Rollins Street, is not

identified, but the class of contracts is identified, and

8

that class of contracts is described as those which are

set aside by the city which are identified by the city

MR. MAGID:

They have alleged generally that they have been

precluded in the past from certain business.

QUESTION:

21

MR. MAGID:

Okay.
However, the ordinance itself does

22

not state whether the particular projects that they might

be interested in have ever been set aside or will be set

aside in the future.

It doesn't say, construction contracts, or

you that there is a contradiction facially with the

The problem in this case is the fact that they

can't hide behind its associational standing.

The general

2

allegations of the complaint that our members are

3

suffering under this ordinance are unsupported even in the

4

complaint, in the complaint and later on in summary-

5

judgment, with any specific instance, and like any other

6

litigant an association should have to come forward and

7

show a specific instance of actual case in controversy so

8

the court -- a court doesn't find itself in a situation

9

where we are today.

10

QUESTION:

Well, certainly -- certainly it very

11

likely -- it should at some stage of the litigation, if

12

you say you can't show that there was any contract you

13

were excluded from, they should have to show that their

14

allegation in their complaint that the city had set aside

15

certain ones was true, but I don't think you can focus

16

just on the complaint in that inquiry.

17

There are all sorts of ways in litigation to

18

bring out specific answers to questions that may have to

19

be asked at trial.

20

MR. MAGID:

The only thing I would refer you to,

21

Your Honor, is that of course, as you get through the

22

stages of the litigation like the Lujan case specifically

23

talked about, you have a higher threshold of evidence to

24

show the court that you fulfilled the obligation, and you

25

can assure the court that there was an actual case in

1

controversy.

2

However, there's a case -- Bender v.

3

Williamsport -- where the court talks in language of any

4

doubt that that actual case in controversy is present

5

should be resolved in favor of not allowing a case to

6

proceed, or the presumption is that -- the presumption is

7

that actual case in controversy is not present.

8

9

Based upon those very -- the law is exacting
when it comes to standing.

Based upon those opinions, we

10

would submit to you that you should put it in your

11

pleadings and specifically allege, and put the court on

12

alert, that you have standing.

13

If you continually -- if litigants continually

14

to allege -- continue -- associations continue to allege

15

our members are hurt generally, a court can't be satisfied

16

that standing is present.

17

QUESTION:

Well, the test is whether that

18

allegation is sufficient to show standing.

19

insist that in a separate paragraph of the complaint the

20

plaintiff would say the plaintiff had standing, would you?

21

MR. MAGID:

No.

You wouldn't

That would be a general

22

conclusory allegation and of course would be insufficient,

23

but something to say here is our actual case, here is the

24

elements of our -- here is a particular -- like Warth

25

suggested, here is a particular project.

We are injured

1

because in this particular project company A was minimally

2

eligible to bid, the city was going to set aside that

3

project, we bid, we didn't get it.

4

QUESTION:

Well, rule 8(a) says the complaint

5

should set aside, what, a short, simple statement of the

6

claim.

7

complaints where there might be any challenge to standing?

8

9

Are you saying there must be a different rule for

MR. MAGID:

I would suggest to you, Your

Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice, sorry -- that when it comes to

10

standing, standing is such a critical doctrine that goes

11

to the separation of powers, of -- and the lawful exercise

12

of the court's authority, that when it comes to that

13

doctrine, that standing should be evident from the face of

14

the pleadings, and conclusory allegations alone put us in

15

a situation where we are here, where a case actually went

16

to judgment and there is no record evidence that at least

17

one AGC member in one instance has ever been injured by

18

the ordinance.

19

QUESTION:

But isn't that attributable to the

20

fact that standing was never raised until it got to the

21

Eleventh Circuit?

22

MR. MAGID:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. MAGID:

25

Partly, Your Honor.
Well -I mean -- well, wholly, but the idea

is that if there was a pleading rule, that it should be

1

from the face of the pleadings that it should appear, and

2

I think there is some language in Bender v. Williamsport

3

that it should appear from the pleadings that

4

presumptively -- the presumption is that it doesn't exist,

5

so you must -- when you have to overcome a presumption,

6

there's something more you would have to do than just

7

do - - cite conclusory allegations.
And I know there's a conflict with the Federal

8

9

Rules of Civil Procedure when it comes to Rule 8, but

10

standing is so important, and there's a presumption that a

11

court - - at the minimum, a court at the pleading stage

12

would dismiss the case and say, you know -- not dismiss

13

the case, dismiss the pleading, and allow you to replead.

14

But again, in this case we have gone to the

15

summary judgment stage, and when you're at the summary

16

judgment stage, and you move for summary judgment, you're

17

on notice that that standing element is present.

18

QUESTION:

May I ask another question?

We've

19

talked mostly about the set-aside of 10 percent that your

20

opponents say they were entirely excluded from getting

21

contracts.

22

Did they not also allege that even as to the

23

contracts they got they had an obligation under the

24

ordinance to have subcontracted 10 percent of that work,

25

and that that had caused them extra expense, and is that

the subject of a different analysis?
MR. MAGID:

Your Honor, I'm aware of the

3

allegation that you're reading.

4

suggest -- actually, the allegation of the complaint is

5

that all city contracts require 10 percent subcontracts.

6

The ordinance does not

The ordinance itself does not require all

7

contracts be - - have 10 percent participation of

8

minorities.

There's no place in the ordinance that

QUESTION:

But does it require some contracts

11

given to nonminority contractors to have 10 percent for

12

minority contractors?

13

MR. MAGID:

Yes, but it doesn't say 10 percent.

14

It leaves it open as to what the percentage might be.

provision that you're referring to --

QUESTION:

But in any event, they did allege

17

that that provision of the ordinance caused them to make

18

subcontracts that were less advantageous than if they'd

19

not had to do that.

20

MR. MAGID:

Right, Your Honor, but that

21

allegation, again there is -- on its face, and I think the

22

Eleventh Circuit has stated this previously, that an

allegation that it costs you more to hire somebody else,

you're just going to pass it on in your bid, anyway.

3

to cost anybody anybody -- anything extra, so there is no

4

economic injury for that alone.

5

As a general contractor you're trying to meet your

In this case, Your Honor, the litigants and

6

lawyers and courts need to be reminded that sometimes - -

7

that they are blinded by the ultimate ends a lawsuit might

8

bring, and in this case the litigant's zealousness to stop

9

a Government program that they did not like, did not wait

10
11

12

for the time when an actual case had arisen.
The fact that the issue was raised by the court
only -- or the appellate court in this case, only

3

underscores the importance of the standing doctrine to the

4

court's lawful exercise of its authority.

5

The AGC in this case rushed to court after the

6

Croson decision attempting to halt the city's program, and

7

successfully did, without ever showing that an actual

8

case, an actual instance where one AGC member was injured

9

during the 5 years of the existence of the program, and

20

they were able to get an opinion that now stands as an

21

advisory opinion because there's no record of evidence in

22

that record, even though the case had gone to judgment,

23

that there is an actual case in controversy.

24
25

In conclusion, conclusory allegations of injury
are not sufficient to establish constitutional standing.

1

Without allegations of specific injury, a court cannot be

2

assured that standing is present and that it should

3

resolve a dispute between the parties.

4

Relaxing standing doctrine would only upset the

5

delicate balance of power among the branches of

6

Government, expand judicial power unnecessarily, and

7

sanction advisory opinions.

The court in this case, the appellate court in

Thank you, Your Honor.

18

The standard that the City of Jacksonville would

We would simply ask that this Court decide what it is that

3

we must show in the lower court, whether we must show a

specific contract, or whether we must show the matching

contracts that the City of Jacksonville is asking for.
In the final analysis, however, we believe that

6

7

in order to be consistent with prior precedent, that the

8

correct rule in this case is the one that we have already

9

met, which is that the City of Jacksonville has an

10

ordinance that excludes contractors from consideration if

11

they fit within the category, and that we, as nonminority

contractors who do business with the City of Jacksonville,

13

are within that category.
