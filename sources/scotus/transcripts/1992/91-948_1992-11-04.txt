ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LAYCOCK:

QUESTION:

Well, we do need --

Or at least it's possible that some

of the ordinances might not be discriminatory on their

5

face is that it?

6

MR. LAYCOCK:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LAYCOCK:

9

It is possible in theory, yes.

Okay.

All right.

All four ordinances have merged

from the same pattern of legislation.

I think they all

10

share the intent, but the intent is recited principally in

11

87-52 and 87-71.
The accompanying resolution that goes with the

12

13

ordinance recites that the target is certain religions and

14

certain acts of any and all religious groups.

15

ordinances are written in religious terminology.

16

not forbid killing, they forbid sacrifice, and indeed,

17

these ordinances do not forbid any physical act as such.

18

All the prohibitions depend in part upon an analysis of

19

the purposes or motives of the actor, and when the

20

analysis is complete, the religious motive is always

21

forbidden.

22

The
They do

But I think what is most revealing about these

23

ordinances is that they are written on the assumption that

24

animal sacrifice is unnecessary.

25

it's unnecessary, the State Attorney General's opinion

says it's unnecessary, all of the city's amici say it is

2

unnecessary, and lack of necessity is an element of the

3

offense in three of the four ordinances.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Laycock, may I ask you a

5

preliminary question?

6

on some of this as well, is there not?

7

There is a State law that touches

MR. LAYCOCK:

There is a State law that is

8

incorporated into one of the ordinances.

9

not challenged in this case.

10

QUESTION:

The State law is

I think --

Well, has the Attorney General of the

11

State interpreted the State law to encompass the practices

12

at issue here?

13

MR. LAYCOCK:

Yes.

The State -- the sequence

14

was, was the Hialeah City Council enacted ordinance 87-

15

40, which incorporates the State statute, and then the

16

city requested of the Attorney General an opinion as to

17

whether the State statute that had thus been incorporated

18

applied to animal sacrifice, and he responded that it did

19

apply because sacrifice is unnecessary.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

So even if you win here, presumably

the State law would be in effect.
MR. LAYCOCK:

Whether the State law remains in

23

effect, the State is not a party.

There was no ripe

24

threat of prosecution from the State.

25

threat from the city.

There was a ripe

QUESTION:

1

And so do we have any of the concerns

2

expressed in Renee v. Geary, our case dealing with

3

redressability?

4

MR. LAYCOCK:

I'm not familiar with Renee, but I

5

am familiar with the redressability issue.

6

can resolve all of the ripe threats of prosecution and

7

entirely redress that injury.
The State may or may not at some point in the

future attempt to enforce the State law.

It has not yet

10

done so.

There are a variety of other general statutes

11

that the city may at some point construe to apply against

12

us.

None of those controversies are ripe either.

13

QUESTION:

Well, the State law may not suffer

14

from what you claim to be the principal flaw in these

15

ordinances, namely, an express intent to affect religious

16

rituals, and the State law may be neutral on its face.

17

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, the State law is not neutral

18

on its face as applied to this practice, but you're right,

19

Justice White, that the history of the State law is very

20

different.

21

to enforce the State --

22

That would be a different case, but an attempt

QUESTION:

Well, if there was an attack on the

23

State law, would you be arguing that it is specifically

24

aimed at religious practices and nothing else?

MR. LAYCOCK:

No.

If we were attacking the

1

State law, I would be arguing that the theory, the legal

2

theory of the Attorney General to make the State law

3

applicable targeted religion.

4

many secular applications, but the theory by which it

5

might apply to us is a theory that violates the First

6

Amendment and is specifically targeted at religion.

7

QUESTION:

The statute as a whole has

Well, would the attack on the State

8

law be somewhat more difficult for you to sustain than the

9

attack on the local ordinance?

10

MR. LAYCOCK:

I think that if the ordinances are

11

struck down, the stare decisis effect will pretty much

12

take care of us on the State statute, but the history, the

13

way in which the ordinances were enacted, is unique to the

14

ordinances and does not apply to the statute.

15

QUESTION:

The --

Mr. Laycock, what do you rely on for

16

the threat of prosecution from the city?

17

prologue, or have there been other threats of prosecution?

18

MR. LAYCOCK:

It's just the

Well, the finding of fact is that

19

the city firmly intended to prevent all animal sacrifice

20

in the city, the city adopted resolutions reciting that

21

intention, the entire legislative package was targeted at

22

my clients.

23

and then they have complied for 5 years as a result of

24

that threat of prosecution.

25

The threat of prosecution seemed quite real,

4

ordinances?
MR. LAYCOCK:

No, none of them are zoning

ordinances, and zoning is a red herring in the case.
Some of the ordinances say that with proper

5

zoning you can have a commercial food business or a

6

commercial slaughterhouse, but none of the ordinances say

7

or even imply that with proper zoning you could sacrifice.

8

Sacrifice is absolutely forbidden.

9

So there are farms within the city limits with

10

proper zoning.

You can slaughter hogs and cattle with

11

proper zoning.

Slaughterhouses turn out millions of

12

pounds of meat per day, and in theory, although not in

13

fact, they could be zoned into Hialeah, but sacrifice will

14

remain absolutely forbidden by these ordinances even with

15

those -- even with slaughterhouse zoning.

16
17

QUESTION:

And does your client still intend to

perform these sacrifices within the City of Hialeah?

18

MR. LAYCOCK:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. LAYCOCK:

Yes, he does.

Does the ordinance define sacrifice?
The ordinance defines sacrifice as

21

the unnecessary killing of an animal in a ritual or

22

ceremony not for the primary purpose of food consumption.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And when you say sacrifice, you are

using it in the term that the ordinance defines it, then.
MR. LAYCOCK:

That's right.

That's right.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Laycock, if you were attacking

2

solely the State statute and you were doing so following

3

an opinion of the Attorney General that a sacrifice was

4

unnecessary, what would your argument be consistent with

5

Smith?

6

MR. LAYCOCK:

Well, Smith says that religious

7

acts are subject to neutral and generally applicable

8

regulation, but Smith also reaffirms the long line of

9

cases that says Government cannot resolve religious

10

controversies.

11

is necessary or unnecessary.

12

Government cannot decide whether sacrifice

An element of the offense under the State law is

13

that the killing of the animal be unnecessary.

14

also an element under three of the four ordinances.

15

only way to prove that sacrifice is unnecessary is to

16

prove that Santeria is a false religion.

17

That's
The

To believers in Santeria, sacrifice is directly

18

commanded by the gods in considerable detail on each

19

occasion when it is required.

20

you must prove the religion false, and when the prosecutor

21

has to prove a religion false, the prosecutor is engaged

22

in a heresy trial.

23

QUESTION:

To prove it unnecessary,

Gee, there -- I'm sure there are a

24

lot of statutes, local, State and Federal, that use the

25

term unnecessary.

Do you mean whenever somebody says that

1

God tells him it is necessary, that statute is invalid as

2

applied to that person?
MR. LAYCOCK:

3

That can't be right.
The prohibition has to depend upon

4

something other than the lack of necessity, Justice

5

Scalia.

6

If Hialeah had a generally applicable

7

prohibition on killing animals, if it said no one may kill

8

an animal in the City of Hialeah, the religious necessity

9

would be irrelevant under this Court's decision in Smith,

10

but Hialeah doesn't have anything like that.

Hialeah

11

says, you can kill animals for a whole range of reasons

12

that we the city consider necessary, but not for this

13

religious reason that we the city consider unnecessary.

14

So the necessity element is applied directly to

15

the theological question, and that is forbidden, I think,

16

by the most central principal of the First Amendment and

17

reaffirmed in Employment Division v. Smith.

18

It's also important that none of these

19

ordinances interfere with any of the routine killings of

20

animals that the citizens of Hialeah depend upon every

21

day.

22

only necessary, they're important.

is very important.

city can deal with one perceived evil at a time without
having to deal with the whole ball of wax, can't it?
MR. LAYCOCK:

I disagree, Mr. Chief Justice.

When the first step is the First Amendment, they can't

deal with that one step at a time.

constitutionally protected activities in a generally

applicable way.

They have to deal with

They can distinguish bow hunting from killing

one and only step is to suppress this religion and

distinguish that from all of the secular killings of

animals that they permit.

lots of other things that they should have embraced, and

their response to that is, well, none of those were going

those things go on

MR. LAYCOCK:

And the record does not show that

none of those things go on.

5

QUESTION:

I'm giving you a hypothetical.

6

MR. LAYCOCK:

Okay.

Then -- yeah, if no other

7

killings of animals are going on in the City of Hialeah,

8

then their solution under Smith would be to draft an

9

ordinance that simply says, it is illegal to kill an

20

animal in the City of Hialeah.

That would be unfortunate

21

for my clients, but under Smith that would be a neutral

22

and generally applicable law.

23

QUESTION:

And then --

They can't make any exceptions to it.

24

Once they make any exception at all, it's no longer a law

25

of general applicability.

MR. LAYCOCK:

1

I'm inclined to think they can't

2

make any exceptions, but this case doesn't get us anywhere

3

close to that question.

4

QUESTION:

You mean, you couldn't say you may

5

kill animals for food but not for other purposes -- not

6

for sport, not for sacrifice, not for anything but food.

7

You couldn't even make that exception.
MR. LAYCOCK:

8

9
10

I can imagine an exception you'd

kill an animal in self defense if you're being attacked by
a bear.

11

QUESTION:

Yes, an animal in self -- or --

12

MR. LAYCOCK:

Right, okay.

I can imagine very

13

narrow exceptions, but what they cannot do is create broad

14

exceptions that eliminate the political resistance to the

15

law and enable them merely to target the unpopular

16

religion.

17

Smith, they have to treat religion at least as well as

18

they treat favored secular activities.

19

They have to treat - - as I read your opinion in

QUESTION:

Well, but it may not be targeting the

20

unpopular religion, it may be targeting the unpopular act,

21

which may be an act that happens to be practiced only by

22

the religion.

23

MR. LAYCOCK:

The act is not different.

The

24

animal is equally dead whether killed in a ritual or

25

ceremony or killed otherwise.

QUESTION:

1

Yes, but you've acknowledged that the

2

act becomes different depending upon what its purpose is,

3

that you'll allow it in self defense, you might allow it

4

for food,'but you might not want to allow it for other

5

purposes.

6

MR. LAYCOCK:

7

QUESTION:

8

I -- I --

It's a different act depending on

what the - MR. LAYCOCK:

9

I do not believe they can allow

10

animals to be killed for food without a ritual or ceremony

11

and forbid these sacrifices where the animals are killed

12

in a ritual or ceremony and then eaten.

13

that.

14

QUESTION:

They can't do

Take, for example, United States v.

15

Reynolds, which was the case in which we upheld the

16

constitutionality of a law prohibiting bigamy in the

17

territory of the United States.

18

Suppose that -- in fact, the only -- there was

19

no problem with bigamy, that the only reason the law was

20

enacted was because there was a single --a single

21

religious group that practiced it.

22

therefore, since the only people who do that act happen to

23

do it for religious reasons, is that law invalid?

MR. LAYCOCK:

Would that law

law was not analogous to this one.

1

is forbidden when done pursuant to the teachings of

2

celestial marriage, bigamy is bad when done for religious

3

reasons.

It was an across-the-board prohibition, and --

4

QUESTION:

But --

5

MR. LAYCOCK:

It implemented a prohibition that

6

had been present in Anglo-American law for centuries, and

7

there had been bigamy by people who were not Mormons and

8

who were not religiously motivated.

9

QUESTION:

That hinges on your saying -- or

10

ignoring, I think, the definition of sacrifice though,

11

doesn't it, because the definition of sacrifice includes

12

any ritualistic killing which would include a killing by a

13

fraternity group.

14

Now, you may say well, there aren't any

15

fraternity groups, but that just brings you back to the

16

problem in Reynolds.

17

practicing bigamy, either.

18

MR. LAYCOCK:

There may not have been anybody else

There may not have been anybody

19

else in Utah at that moment, but bigamy laws have been

20

around for a long time because there had been a problem

21

that the legislatures and the common law had addressed.

22

The legislatures and the common law have never

23

tried to suppress the killing of animals in any systematic

24

way, and if this Court is willing to accept that a

25

definition of sacrifice that contains a hypothetical

1

fraternity ritual is thereby not targeted religion, I

2

think you would equally have to accept that a prohibition

3

on communion is nondiscriminatory and neutral because it

4

might include a fraternity initiation.

5

QUESTION:

Could the city council require that

6

all slaughter of animals within the city be done in a

7

humane manner and define humane in a way that the result

8

of which was to either prohibit or require the alteration

9

of these sacrifices?
MR. LAYCOCK:

10

Again, I think they could do that

11

if they did it in a neutral and across-the-board way, but

12

many of the killings that they permit are slower and less

3

reliable,' crueler than the method of sacrifice by slicing

4

the carotid arteries, which is the method specified in the

5

State and Federal humane slaughter acts.

6

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Laycock, in your view as

7

you read Smith, what is the purpose of the neutrality

8

requirement?

9

Is it an end in itself?

MR. LAYCOCK:

I don't think it's an end in

20

itself.

I hope that the purpose is to build into the

21

political process some of the protection for religious

22

minorities that the other half of Smith says that the

23

courts are not going to be providing on their own.

24

QUESTION:

25

that we administer.

Well, we have a neutrality standard
What is the purpose of that standard?

MR. LAYCOCK:

1

Well, I think the purpose is that

this Court stands ready, it says in Smith, to say that if

you - - if a Government singles out religion for special

burdens or special prohibition, that is forbidden.

have to at least treat religious acts as well as you treat

analogous secular acts.

the evaluation of whether or not in fact this religious

2

practice was targeted or whether a legitimate governmental

I believe

that is alleged with regard to the ordinances.

What type of problems are we talking about?

2

We're talking about human health hazards.

The human

3

health hazard evidence was evidence concerning the fact

that when sacrifices take place, that as many as 52

5

animals in a single day are killed, and they are killed in

6

a private residence in many instances and then they are

7

decapitated, blood is put into pots, the animals are then

8

oftentimes left out in public places if there is a ritual

9

that requires the animal to be left in a public place.
There are problems connected with disease.

10

The

11

disease problems were discussed directly at the trial

12

court as being a problem associated with the fact that the

13

killings take place in residences, and as a result of that

you have spilled blood, you have animal parts left in and

the ways in which animals may be killed and the ways or

requirements for disposition of any remains, is that not

right?

effectiveness, Your Honor.

2

the animal sacrifice problem begins all the way from the

3

point in which the animals are possessed for the purposes

4

of animal sacrifice, that the evidence at the district

5

court level was that the inhumane treatment to the

6

animals, which is one of the problems that we cite, begins

7

at that point, and that enforcement is almost impossible

8

because the botanicas and other farms that sell these

9

animals, you have a quickly moving problem.

10
11

We believe that the nature of

Enforcement

is very difficult.
More importantly, with respect to the possession

12

of the animals during the sacrifice, there is no evidence

13

that you can solve all of the problems in a house, in a

14

private residence, with respect to a quiltwork of

15

ordinances designed to regulate everything that goes on in

16

that private residence from the standpoint of how many

17

animals you have in that residence, how many -- how they

18

can be killed, what you do with the blood cauldrons, how

19

you have to hold the knife.

20

Then you have problems associated with the

21

disposal of the animals, and that the religions oftentimes

22

mandate they be left in public places.

23

The point is that with respect to effectively

24

solving the problems, it is our position that, 1) you

couldn't solve all the problems with a series of

ordinances, and 2) that the nature of the kind of

2

entanglement that you would be getting involved in as a

3

result of passing this patchwork of ordinances would

4

itself cause a constitutionality problem of entanglement

5

with the religion.

6

Finally, the kind of ordinances that would be

7

required to deal with this problem even to begin

8

approaching effectiveness -- and we contend the city is

9

not required constitutionally to enact a large number of

10

ordinances which still don't solve the problem.

11

But assuming that you did enact a large number

12

of ordinances, it's our position that they would be back

13

in court saying you've in effect prohibited us from doing

14

what we need to do in our religion, because now you have

15

told us how we have to hold our knives, how we have to

16

kill them, how we have to handle the blood in the

17

particular ceremonies, and how we have to dispose of the

18

animals, and our gods say that's not what we can do, and

19

therefore we would have the same problem.

20

We'd be back here with a different type of

21

argument, but with the same kind of argument that the

regulatory framework that we had created effectively

precluded them from practicing their religion, and that is

MR. GARRETT:

4
5

Your Honor, there are two

responses to that:
1)

6

This is not only a religious practice.

7

There is evidence in the record which has not been

8

mentioned that groups engage in this activity --

9

malevolent magic is mentioned by one of their witnesses to

10

describe what existed with respect to a goat that was cut

11

in half and found on Miami Beach.
There are also -- there's also evidence in the

13

record with respect to the fact that this particular type

14

of practice is engaged in by Satanists, by witchcraft,

15

voodoo, and this Court has never gone so far as to

particularly extend protection to those groups.

23

We dealt with our particular governmental

1

2

problem.

We didn't have any record of evidence of any

3

problems of hunting, any problems of euthanasia, and

4

therefore we meet the neutrality standard.
But I think that there's a second separate

5
6

ground that doesn't even require a Smith analysis and

7

conclusion of neutrality, which is simply that we had

8

substantial compelling governmental interests that

9

justified the particular ordinances at hand, and we

10

mentioned at the trial court and we argued that the human

11

health hazards are substantial.
The human health hazards, which I want to get

12

13

back to a for a moment -- when you talk about killing of

14

large numbers of animals, and blood and goat heads being

15

present in a community where people live, in residence

16

areas, you are dealing, according to the expert testimony,

17

with a problem of creating vectors for disease.

Because the sanitary problem that

we have identified is one that is unique to animal parts

MR. GARRETT:

Because if you prohibit the

2

sacrifice, because you are in a position to stop it at a

3

point when the animals are possessed, because you also

have a possession statute and you have animals lined up

5

going into a residence, you in effect preclude the problem

from developing.

QUESTION:

Well, I know you do if you can do it,

9

effective in preventing the practice within the private

10

house than you are to be in preventing the disposal in a

12

MR. GARRETT:

Because our view is that there are

indications of when an animal sacrifice is about to take

place in a house.

there are animals outside, and it is the view that we

would be able to stop that.

(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

Well,

let me ask you this.

If a

11

church finds a slaughterhouse that is properly zoned and

12

if it follows standards of applicability that are general

13

for the disposal of animals, does it have a constitutional

14

right to engage in its sacrificial services?

15

MR. GARRETT:

No, we do not believe that a

16

church would have a right to engage in animal sacrifice

17

under circumstances that you have now described.

18

QUESTION:

Why?

19

MR. GARRETT:

Because we believe that the

20

Constitution does not allow all religious practices to be

21

engaged in even if they are central to the religion.

QUESTION:

specifically focused on by a series of --

12

QUESTION:

And is it a fair reading of these

ordinances to find that that policy is implicit in these
ordinances ?
MR. GARRETT:

I think it is a fair reading of

the ordinances that they in effect attempt to preclude

3

animal sacrifice, and they do that in a number of

4

different ways, and I think that is the question that the

5

Court is facing, whether or not the attempt, and in this

6

case a successful attempt to preclude the animal sacrifice

7

as a governmental problem, is one that can be done under

8

the First Amendment, free exercise provision.

9

QUESTION:

But would you not agree that in order

20

for the prohibition to be legitimate, the public values

21

that you assert are being furthered by the prohibition

22

must not be allowed to be compromised through other

23

exceptions to the killing that you allow, because

24

otherwise you would have nothing left but an antagonism

towards the religion.

If you have other values -- cruelty to animals

2

3

or public sanitation or whatever else -- at least the

4

other exceptions that you make from your general

5

prohibition cannot permit those things to happen.
MR. GARRETT:

6

I believe that the question

7

becomes what particular problems the municipality is

8

facing, and if the municipality has to go and deal with

9

the hypothetical problems in the scope of the ordinance

10

that are not really facing the community, I don't see why

11

that is constitutionally mandated.

12

It would seem that if the problems that we have

13

been able to identify are problems that grow specifically

14

out of animal sacrifice, that it is not required that the

15

city, for example, exempt hunting or any other particular

16

type of problem or deal with them in the ordinances.
It's clear that animal sacrifice carries with it

17
18

very specific problems that are not attendant with the

19

other types of exceptions that the petitioners point to.

20

There is no record evidence that we have any of those

21

particular problems, and I think that it's a question of

22

the classification.

that under 87-72, under circumstances where there was an

so we're talking about altering the manner in which they

2

actually kill the animals.
QUESTION:

3

But as I understand it, there's an

4

exemption in the statute so that there's killing for food,

5

and if it's less than, I think, 35 lambs a week or

6

20 cattle, something like that, it's permitted.
MR. GARRETT:

7

It is permitted, but the method of

8

humane slaughter is not altered by that exception.

Humane

9

slaughter must still be practiced in killing the animals,

10

and so simply moving this religion into a slaughterhouse

11

doesn't solve the problems of meeting the humane slaughter

12

standards.
QUESTION:

13

Well, your opponent I thought agreed

14

that the city could prohibit inhumane slaughtering so long

15

as it did it across the board.
MR. GARRETT:

16

I believe that the petitioner's

17

claim that they are entitled to slaughter the animals

18

according to their religious dictates, and that that would

19

not be subject to the regulation that we propose and that

the State proposes with respect to humane slaughter.
