ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 91-1111

10
11

MR. SHAPIRO:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:

12

I appear on behalf of the domestic insurance

13

defendants who are petitioners in Case Number 91-1111.

14

We're hear today to contend that the Ninth Circuit's

15

forfeiture ruling in this case was wrong, and in addition

16

that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in overturning Judge

17

Schwarzer's decision on the McCarran boycott issue.

18

As the Court is aware, the Ninth Circuit held in

19

this case that the domestic defendants forfeited their

20

McCarran Act immunity by acting in concert with foreign

21

reinsurers, and it held in addition that their conduct

22

amounted to a boycott within the meaning of the McCarran-

23

Ferguson Act.

24
25

On the forfeiture issue, we agree with the
Justice Department that the domestic defendants, which

1

both courts below found were engaged in the regulated

2

business of insurance, did not forfeit their immunity

3

simply by acting in concert with foreign reinsurers.

4

The Government properly points out that the

5

McCarran immunity literally focuses on the regulated

6

business of insurance and does not focus narrowly on the

7

regulated status of each participant in that process.

8

Congress understood when it passed the McCarran act that

9

domestic insurers would enter into agreements with

10

reinsurers, including foreign reinsurers, and it believed

11

that antitrust immunity would extend to these insurance

12

practices.

13

Under this statute, the exemption of domestic

14

insurers does not simply vanish when they deal with

15

entities such as consumer groups or risk managers or

16

foreign reinsurers, all of which are vital participants in

17

the forms-developmentprocess and each of which can easily

18

be characterized as a nonexempt entity or a so-called

19

coconspirator.

20

QUESTION:

What, then, do you do with the

21

language in Royal Drug Company, Mr. Shapiro, about when

22

you conspire or agree with someone who's not protected the

23

exempt party loses the exemption?

24
25

MR. SHAPIRO:

Royal Drug, Your Honor, was

talking about the business of insurance requirement, which

concededly is satisfied here, and the reason that it
wasn't satisfied there was that there was an agreement
between an insurance company and somebody outside of the
insurance industry.

Now, in this case everybody is within

the insurance industry and the Justice Department properly
points out that Royal Drug is not support for the
forfeiture ruling here.
QUESTION:

Well, excuse me, it isn't enough to

be within the business of insurance.

You have to be

within the business of insurance regulated by the
States -MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

Isn't that right?

MR. SHAPIRO:
QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

Both courts --

And that is certainly not conceded

that the foreign insurers, or the reinsurers generally,
are within the business of insurance regulated by the
State.
MR. SHAPIRO:

Both courts below found that all

domestic defendants, including the reinsurers, were
regulated under State law, and the Justice Department
agrees that these regulated entities that are acting
within the business of insurance don't lose their immunity
simply because they enter into discussions or agreements
with foreign reinsurers.

laws which all 50 States have enacted and which this Court

2

squarely held is enough to predicate McCarran immunity.
QUESTION:

3

The forms -developmentprocess cannot

compel a reinsurer to reinsure something that he doesn't

that.

except one permit the first kind of insurance that's been

10

eliminated -- event occurrence insurance.

11

one permit it, but it's not offered by anybody, right?

12

MR. SHAPIRO:

All States but

Well, as a matter of fact,

13

98 percent of the commercial general liability policies

14

today are written on occurrence forms.

15

that they've been eliminated, although the complaint

16

alleges that they have been reduced in quantity.

It's wrong to say

17

Now, if a State insurance regulator believed

18

that there was some improper concerted action that was

19

constricting the flow of this coverage into the

20

marketplace, they have ample means under State unfair

21

insurance practice laws to deal with any agreement that

22

they believe is contrary to public policy.

23

These laws are passed in all 50 States for the

24

very purpose of taking the place of Federal antitrust

statutes in order to invoke the McCarran immunity for the

disagree with that.

7

The district court so concluded

This is general law, not peculiarly

MR. SHAPIRO:

Oh, no, sir, they are specifically

focused on the insurance industry.

These are model laws

based on the National Association of Insurance

10

Commissioners' proposed statute right after this Court's

11

decision in the South-Eastern case.

12

on insurance, and they deal with anticompetitive acts in

13

the insurance industry.

14

They focus precisely

This Court held squarely in the National

15

Casualty case in the fifties that if the States pass these

16

laws, and if these laws embrace the anticompetitive

17

actions, that, standing by itself, is sufficient for

18

McCarran immunity purposes, and that precedent has been

19

followed ever since and the industry and regulators have

20

relied on it.

1

Well, Your Honor,

I think the

point is the Justice Department agrees with us that you

with -- risk managers, all -- consumer groups that are not

10

they are still within the business of insurance.
QUESTION:

Here's the statement from Royal Drug,

Mr. Shapiro, and it's obviously one sentence out of a long

opinion.

Now, we submit to the Court that the principal

2

3

question here is whether Judge Schwarzer or the Ninth

4

Circuit got the McCarran boycott question right, and in

5

assessing the legal sufficiency of that separate question

6

in the case, it's essential to bear in mind the two

7

different kinds of conduct that are being alleged in this

8

case.

9

The first is forms development.
Plaintiffs take the position that domestic and

10

foreign defendants agreed that reinsurance would not be

11

offered on certain advisory insurance forms that had been

12

proposed unless changes were made in those forms.

13

Now, the second type of conduct is so-called

14

market conduct.

15

defendants jointly decided that certain coverages would

16

not be reinsured.

activity together through a global conspiracy claim which

18

the district court dismissed, and the court of appeals

19

affirmed that dismissal with an opportunity for plaintiffs

20

to offer a specific amended pleading in the future.

21

Plaintiffs claim that the foreign

They tried to link these two kinds of

That is further down the road in this case.

22

There is no validly stated claim of global conspiracy in

the case at this time, and we've explained in the

alternative in our reply brief that it wouldn't make any

25

difference, even if this global conspiracy claim ran

everybody together in this case, domestic and foreigners,

2

because plaintiffs have not alleged the elements of a

McCarran Act boycott.

Now,

the parties have spent a great deal of time

and attention on the forms development - QUESTION:

that?

a boycott -- that's our whole submission -- but the
parties may agree upon acceptable trade terms and insist
that others comply with them.
There's a vivid discussion of this in Sullivan's
Antitrust Treatise at page 257, where he distinguishes
between agreements on trade terms and boycotts, and he
says,

"The agreeing parties are not coercing anyone, at

least in the usual sense of that word.

They are merely,

though concertedly, saying, we will deal with you only on
the following trade terms," and he -- Professor Sullivan
points out that that should not be deemed a boycott, even
under the Sherman Act, and it can't be deemed a boycott
under the McCarran act, because the McCarran act permits
insurance companies to agree among themselves on
acceptable terms and conditions and coverages.

distinction between terms of coverage and insurance

was the product, in part, of an amicus submission from the

is what they said in their amicus brief that preceded this

don't dispute that insurers and reinsurers may agree as to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

4
5
6

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In looking into this case as amicus curiae, what

7

we view as most significant in these complaints are

8

allegations that the collaborators agreed upon an
enforcement mechanism, namely the cutting off of

10

reinsurance, to ensure compliance with a privately imposed

11

trade restraint restricting the kinds of commercial

12

liability insurance that would be available, and in the

13

questioning, members of the Court have put their finger on

14

the relevant allegations in the complaints.

15

They're on pages 24 and 25 of the Joint

16

Appendix, particularly paragraphs 64 through 6 , which

17

shows that the enforcement mechanism of cutting off the

18

availability of reinsurance was allegedly imposed at the

1

behest of the primaries, Hartford and its allies, which

20

were seeking to restrict the kind of coverage being

21

offered by their competitors.

22

Now, enforcement mechanisms pose special dangers

23

to competition and to consumer interests, and this is

24

because, in general, the greater the consumer need or

25

desire for particular products or services that the trade

1

restraint withholds, the more likely it is that the

2

restraint will tend to break down through a sort of

3

centrifugal force as individual firms respond to the

4

resulting competitive opportunity posed by these unmet

5

consumer needs, and enforcement mechanisms as part of the

6

conspiracy really presuppose this and are designed to

7

apply countervailing pressure to preserve the

8

effectiveness of the restraint against this centrifugal

9

force, if you will.

10

And here the allegations go beyond the normal

11

hypothesis that members of the agreement must be

12

restrained from the temptation to break out, and charge

13

that the enforcement mechanism was applied not only to the

14

conspirators themselves, but also to force capitulation by

15

firms that were not parties to the agreement that had

16

resisted Hartford's effort to get the ISO to limit the

17

forms in the same way and, therefore, fairly reading the

18

complaint, that continued to desire to offer the kinds of

19

coverage that the restraint was designed to eliminate.

20

Now, that, to us, is conduct at the core of the

21

exception from McCarran-Ferguson Act immunity that

22

Congress took special care to specify by expressly

23

withholding immunity from any act of boycott, coercion, or

24

intimidation, or agreement to boycott, coerce or

intimidate.

It was the part of the holding of South-Eastern

Underwriters that Congress concluded it should preserve in

To the extent regulated by the

QUESTION:

Because it is thought, I suppose,

Well it's quite possible that the

Now, why is that an evil kind of a boycott that

8

we should say the Government comes down on, given the

MR. WALLACE:

10

The question that you're posing,

11

Mr. Justice, suggests a possible way of defending a

12

boycott as one which under the standards of Northwest

13

Stationers is not one to which a per se condemnation

14

should be applied, and is one that is justified under the

15

circumstances under a rule of reason analysis if that

hypothesis can be substantiated by proof in the particular

case.

But the same claim could be made in a case where

19

the primaries are simply trying to gain a competitive

20

advantage and follow more lucrative practices and prevent

21

their competitors from competing on terms that some of

their customers might prefer, so that the claim is not one

QUESTION:

Well, just from the standpoint of

3

defining the word, boycott, or the juridical concept,

boycott, if the reinsurers had come up with this idea on

5

their own, and they had met, and they had said, we're not

6

going to offer reinsurance for this particular kind of

MR. WALLACE:

Well, certainly they -- the answer

gets a little complicated, if you'll permit me,

Mr. Justice.

11

as to what they will offer, and that would not be a

boycott, even though there may be a question of whether

13

there is implied in that an agreement that there's

14

something they will not offer.

Certainly they could agree among themselves

At the other extreme, if they include an

enforcement mechanism so that one of the parties to the

for discussion that that is not a boycott, does it become

2

a boycott when a primary insurer participates in the

3

4

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

We would definitely say yes.

Why is that?

What is the

6

definitional part of "boycott" that makes this distinction

7

for me?

8
9

MR. WALLACE:

It's the enforcement mechanism

that has made this a boycott, and in this case it's

10

because you've got participants at the primary level and

11

there is an enforcement mechanism against their

12

competitors to prevent their competitors from offering

13

certain products.

14

You don't really have that kind of disciplining

15

of anyone when only the reinsurers are involved, but when

16

you've got the two-level conspiracy with an enforcement

17

mechanism against competitors at one of the levels, you've

18

converted just a refusal to do business on terms that are

19

unacceptable to the reinsurers into an enforcement

20

mechanism that coerces competitors of some of the

21

collaborators into not being able to compete in ways that

22

they want to compete.

23

Now, since my time is running short, I think I

24

should say a word or two about the comity issue, which is

25

The principal of comity was recognized, even if

1

2

in a rather rudimentary way, when the Sherman Act was

3

enacted, and the legislative history of the Foreign Trade

4

Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 suggests that Congress

5

thought comity principals could be employed in antitrust

6

litigation in accordance with decisions such as the Ninth

7

Circuit's Timberlane case.

8

is properly conceived and properly cabined.

9

We agree with that if comity

The important point I want to make is that

10

comity is not an invitation to other nations to decide

11

which of our laws they like or dislike and thereby to

12

determine whether their nationals need or need not comply

13

with particular laws when they're nationals are engaged in

14

commerce in this country.

15

It's not a device for ceding to other nations

16

the making of legal policy for engaging in commerce here,

17

but instead comity analysis should apply objective

18

criteria which have been formulated in multifactor tests

19

that we have discussed in our brief.
Here, the Ninth Circuit applied its own test in

20
21

Timberlane, which has been a leading decision on the

22

subject, and we think it reached the correct result in

23

applying the test and, if anything, was too generous to

24

the claim of comity in holding that there was a conflict

25

at all.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUREL A. PRICE

15

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

16
17

Mr. Price,

MR. PRICE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

18

When a group of insurers enlist third parties to

19

refuse to continue to supply their competitors in order to

20

enforce upon them changes in their competitors' behavior,

21

this Court has always found that that described a boycott

22

within the meaning of the Sherman Act.

23

In these cases in particular, four primary

24

insurance companies decided that they no longer wanted to

25

write particular coverages, but they also knew that they

1

couldn't simply walk away from those coverages because if

2

their competitors continued to write them, they would lose

3

significant share of the market that they currently

4

possessed.

5

In order to forestall that eventuality, they

6

went to reinsurers, and they went to reinsurers precisely

7

because reinsurance is one of the things that an insurer

8

needs in order to be able to effectively write coverage,

9

reinsurance was at the particular time at issue in these

10

cases in short supply, and reinsurance is not effectively

11

regulated by the States.

12

best means immediately available by which they could

13

compel their competitors to also cease writing this

14

coverage, and that is precisely the definition of what

15

constitutes a boycott that this Court found in Barry.

Thus, it was the specific and

16

Indeed, when this Court offered what described

17

as the generic definition of a boycott, it said it was a

18

method of pressure by withholding or enlisting others to

19

withhold patronage or services from the target, and the

20

purpose of that withholding - -

1

At all.

I don't see how it could be.

2

Would it have been unlawful for the American insurers just

3

to call to the attention of the reinsurers the fact that

4

in their view it would be financially disastrous to

continue to reinsure this kind of contract?

Your Honor is raising the difficult

question of whether an agreement or a conspiracy was

What consideration

flows from the reinsurer to the insurer?
MR. PRICE:

11

The question Your Honor is raising,

as is Justice Scalia, is the question of what was the

13

motivation of the reinsurer to enter into this agreement?

14

QUESTION:

What were the two -- to have an

agreement, you have an exchange of promises or performance

on both sides, in contract law.

MR. PRICE:

QUESTION:

That's correct.
What was to be -- what did the

19

insurer agree to do or perform in exchange for the

20

reinsurer's agreement to not write the claims-made forms?
MR. PRICE:

21

The agreement at issue was an

agreement that they were seeking to enlist the aid of the

reinsurers in compelling changes in American reinsurance

MR. PRICE:
QUESTION:

What the
And you say that was an agreement.
Yes.
And you've said that what the

reinsurers agreed to do was not to reinsure any more
claims-made forms, but what did the insurers agree to do?
MR. PRICE:

The insurers agreed amongst

themselves not to offer claims-made coverage, and they
also agreed to attempt to keep other people from using
those forms and offering that coverage as well.
QUESTION:

Well, was that an agreement they made

with the reinsurers?
MR. PRICE:

They went to the reinsurers to

obtain the coercive enforcement mechanism which they
themselves didn't possess over their competitors.
QUESTION:

Well, you're saying, then, that there

wasn't an agreement between the insurers and the
reinsurers, that the insurers agreed among themselves and
then went to the reinsurers to put muscle into the
agreement.

Yes, and that the reinsurers agreed

to provide that muscle.

Yes, Your Honor, somebody had to - I mean, it seems to me it's just

get into real trouble in the American market, and they

say, my God, you're right, we better do that, and --

MR. PRICE:

And they hadn't done it previously

on their own and, indeed, there are matters which are

outside this record which would show that they had

previously been asked whether they thought changes needed

to be made in the 1973 forms and they had said that that

worked.

6

But that doesn't answer the further

Assuming that the predicate is correct that

7

there is a "problem in the American industry," and that

8

problem, the way it has been posited, is that it's

9

unprofitable to write this kind of coverage both at the

10

insurer and reinsurance level, and if that's true, then it

11

is in the economic self-interest of everyone in the

12

industry to abandon that coverage, and if I and my

13

immediate competitors, the four primary defendants in this

14

case, agree that it's in our interest to stop writing this

15

coverage, we agree it is in our interest to get

16

reinsurance for this less coverage, why would they care

17

whether their competitors continued to write this

18

unprofitable coverage which might bankrupt them and leave

19

them a bigger market to control for themselves?

20

QUESTION:

Because there are some risk-averse

21

people and some nonrisk-averse people, and the whole

theory of insurance regulation is that nonrisk-averse

people shouldn't be running insurance companies.

Normally, when you contract for reinsurance, you

as an insurer go to London.

You get a broker.

He goes

7

around and assembles a ad hoc joint venture, if you will,

8

who'll subscribe to a reinsurance treaty to reinsure my

9

book of business, and their willingness to reinsure my

10

book of business in no way depends on their refusing to

11

reinsure any other insurer's book of business, and I don't

12

see why that agreement follows from the fact that there

13

might be some plausible efficiency in the arrangements

14

which you posit, and if there were those efficiencies you

15

wouldn't need these kind of coercive means to compel the

market to reach that rational conclusion and, indeed, the

17

State regulators, who also have those same interests,

18

didn't go out and compel the industry to avoid these

19

coverages as well.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but the whole antitrust

21

exemption is based on a quite different philosophy.

1

exemption posits as beneficial for the industry is

2

voluntary cooperation.

it's cooperation based on mutually

3

perceived joint needs.

It is not cooperation induced with

4

the heavy club of coercion.

5

Indeed, when you look at the structure of the

6

regulation and you look at the structure of the statute,

7

while the statute may permit the States to allow insurers

8

to cooperate in a variety of efficiency-enhancing means,

9

it expressly prohibits boycott, coercion, and

10
11

intimidation.
It was the fears in Congress born of the

12

experience in the South-East Underwriters case that

13

insurers, because they needed certain levels of

14

cooperation to efficiently function, were in a position of

15

danger, that they had a power through cooperation which

16

could be abused, and the way you abuse it is precisely the

17

way it was abused in South-Eastern Underwriters.

18

You withhold from competitors who won't conform

19

their behavior to your private standards, reinsurance,

20

which is a necessary incidence needed, and you withhold

21

from them further the services of rating organizations

22

such as the ISO defendant in this case, which are also

23

necessary, and those are the precise means utilized to

enforce the agreements which we allege in the complaints

purpose to preclude the kind of private regulatory

13

In the Barry case, this Court defined "boycott"

14

with reference to the Sherman Act cases, and it did so

15

because it found that the Sherman Act language had been

16

utilized by the Congress and that the particular purpose

17

the Congress had wished to serve derives specifically from

18

this Court's decision in South-Eastern Underwriters.

to the facts in this case, it is precisely what we've pled

to preclude their competitors from offering coverages

Just the foreign.

We do not concede that their

reinsurance business is regulated by State law in the way

10

that is required by the McCarran act, and there's a

11

distinction there that is important to understand.
They are -- the domestic reinsurers are all

12

13

licensed insurers under the law of each State, and the

14

State has a variety of regulations that applies to their

business activities as insurers.

regulators require insurance companies to offer particular

MR. PRICE:

And they could make the situation

worse in that circumstance.

21

If the reinsurers have decided, pursuant to the

agreement, not to offer reinsurance, and if insurers need

regulator saying, offer that coverage, would put the

1

their available capacity to write this one narrow line of

2

coverage, and would put them in a position where the total

3

amount of coverage they could write was substantially

4

less.

5

So yes, they could order it, and the net effect

6

might well be an absolute constriction of the total output

7

in the market because of the inability to access the

8

reinsurance market.

9

QUESTION:

10
11

You think Lloyd's is going to kiss

goodbye to half of all of its reinsurance business.
MR. PRICE:

One doesn't know what they might do

12

in the short run if they thought they could get a long­

13

term benefit of restructuring a market in a way they liked

14

better than what they currently saw, and section 1 of the

15

Sherman Act punishes those short-term kind of expedients

16

to gain long-term advantages.

17

So the mere fact that you can't find an absolute

18

and totally consistent motivation for them independent of

19

the primary insurers isn't the question.

20

whether they had a shared, unlawful interest which they

21

concluded by prohibited means and which the Sherman Act

22

would remedy.

23

QUESTION:

The question is

Suppose the allegation and the proof

24

were that the sole motive of the primary insurers in

25

making these overtures was the continued solvency of the
63

reinsurers, would that be an unlawful boycott?
MR. PRICE:

2

If their sole -- in other words, if

3

there were simply an agreement on terms of coverage for

4

the purpose of continued solvency.

5

QUESTION:

Right.

The primary insurers said,

6

there is a glitch in a lot of these policies, our

7

principal concern is the preservation of Lloyd's as an

8

effective reinsurer, we are advising you that in your

9

interest and in ours from the standpoint of the solvency

10

of reinsurers, you should not offer this coverage.

11

that unlawful?
MR. PRICE:

12

Is

In that circumstance it would not be

13

a boycott because you don't have any additional activity

14

designed to enforce that agreement on unwilling parties,

15

and indeed, under the precise facts --

16

QUESTION:

Well, suppose as a result of those

17

overtures the reinsurers got together and said, you know,

18

Hartford and its -- other companies like it are absolutely

19

correct.

MR. PRICE:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Well, the mere fact that -In that hypothesis, are the primary

insurers violating the antitrust laws?
MR. PRICE:

What makes the arrangement unlawful

1

offer the coverage, but when they agree with Hartford not

2

to offer the coverage as the means of prohibiting

3

Hartford's competitors from offering the coverage.

4

So the mere fact that you may have multiple

5

levels of the distribution system involved in the

6

agreement isn't what makes it lawful or unlawful.

7

QUESTION:

Well, but many effects can follow

8

from a single motive, and I'm hypothesizing a single

9

motive which I suggest to you may be lawful.

10

MR. PRICE:

But that doesn't mean that the

11

single motive and lawful objective would necessarily be

12

obtained by lawful means.

13

The antitrust laws permit a wide variety of

14

results to occur, but still prohibits those same results

15

when the results are obtained by means prohibited by the

16

antitrust law, and that's the primary difference between

17

section 1 of the law and section 2.

18

Section 2 comes closer, sometimes, to

19

prohibiting specific results, but section 1 always focuses

20

almost exclusively on the means utilized to obtain those

21

results, and thus means are very important.

22

Further addressing the general area that Justice

23

Scalia has directed me to, I would just briefly say that

24

where unregulated conduct becomes an integral part of an

25

unlawful scheme, then all the parties to that scheme are
65

1

jointly and severally liable for it.
The mere fact that some of them might have had

2

3

an exemption for some conduct doesn't change the fact that

4

they're jointly and severally liable for the full scope of

5

the conspiracy, and where regulated and otherwise exempt

6

activities are engaged in in furtherance of the underlying

7

unlawful scheme, then whatever exemption they enjoy has

8

been lost, and that's simply a specialized application of

9

the general proposition that acts lawful in themselves

10

lose that character when they become a constituent element

11

of an overriding and otherwise unlawful scheme.
QUESTION:

12

13
14

Mr. Price?

Well, what's your authority for that,

I mean, in the antitrust context?
MR. PRICE:

In the antitrust context,

15

specifically that language is a paraphrase from the

16

Continental Ore v. Union Carbide case, which we cited in

17

our brief both for that proposition and for several

18

related principles in the international comity area.

QUESTION:

MR. PRICE:

5

Well, but -Mineworkers v. Pennington, and the

whole host of labor and related - QUESTION:

6

How about the statement in Perino,

7

coming after Royal Drug, that the fact that an exempt --

8

deals with nonexempt is a factor, but it isn't

9

controlling?
MR. PRICE:

10

But in Perino, the only question

11

before the Court was whether or not the activity engaged

12

in was the business of insurance, and so this Court said,

13

in determining the first prong of the McCarran test for

14

exemption, the mere fact that a party to the agreement was

15

not an insurer was not itself dispositive of whether the

16

activity engaged in was the business of insurance.

17

It didn't address the additional question of

18

whether that party in activity was entitled the exemption,

19

because it hadn't addressed whether or not its activity

20

was subject to regulation by the State within the meaning

21

of McCarran, so I don't believe that Perino is dispositive

22

for that purpose.

whether there was an intent to harm American commerce, and

American commerce.

Indeed, the test that the Sherman Act cases have

When one looks at reinsurance markets, one thing

8

that is immediately apparent is that they are

9

international in nature, and that includes the London

10

11

market.

Indeed, defendants concede as much.
What I would posit to the Court is that, given

12

the international nature of this market and American

13

markets' dependence on it, the statement that the British

14

Government possesses the sole regulatory interest in how

15

business is conducted in that market is misleading and,

16

indeed, false.

17

I would hypothesize the following case.

Assume

18

the British adopted a statute which said that it was in

19

Britain's interest to promote the manufacture of products

20

for sale in the United States which were inherently

21

dangerous and which were not required to be done with

22

adequate safeguards.

23

I don't think this Court would waste a great

24

deal of time and effort concluding that American State

25

product liability law should apply to that conduct even

1

though the British have articulated a regulatory interest

2

in that conduct.

3

When you look at the jurisdictional test which

4

derives from Alcoa, from the Continental Ore case, and the

5

other cases cited in our brief, the notion of comity is

6

inherent in that test because the comity question as a

7

jurisdictional matter is the question of whether the

8

exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable under the

9

circumstance of a particular case.

10

And the way that we have determined

11

reasonableness is by looking to see whether there was an

12

intent to harm American commerce and whether American

13

commerce was substantially affected, and I suggest that to

14

the extent that there is any confusion in the lower

15

courts, it relates not to the intent and effects standard,

16

but a failure to give meaning to the substantiality of the

17

effect before the exercise of jurisdiction is appropriate.

18

When you look at the Timberlane case itself, you

19

didn't need a 9-factor or a 7-factor or a 10-factor test

20

to tell you ll/100ths of 1 percent of American lumber

21

coming from Honduras probably wasn't a substantial effect

22

and probably wasn't the sort of circumstance where it

23

would be reasonable for an American court to exercise its

24

jurisdiction.

guess would be liable as a contract combination or

conspiracy even if the American insurers had not been part

of the scheme, right?

scrutiny under the antitrust laws.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. PRICE:

Yes, I would think so.
Whether or not it's unlawful, we

12

don't have a record that will tell us that at this point.

13

We certainly could, sir.

14

Indeed, in a related and analogous case this

15

Court unanimously said in Kirkpatrick that this Court

16

would not allow vague notions of comity to serve as the

17

basis by which American courts would abstain from the

18

exercise of its jurisdiction, and indeed expressly allowed

19

as how courts in the United States have the power and

20

ordinarily the obligation to decide the cases presented to

21

them.

I wouldn't -- I wouldn't wish to say

whether it's unflagging or not.

some narrow exceptions, and the exceptions that this Court

2

has recognized are the active State cases where it's

3

narrowly confined to its role as a rule of decision, and

4

we would also submit that circumstances which related to

5

foreign sovereign compulsion might also, as a matter of

6

due process, be cases where jurisdiction might be

inappropriate.
But the level of conflicts posited in this case

by the British Government I do not believe are the sort

10

that this Court ought to give deference to.

11

posited by the United Kingdom is one of a system of self-

They

That's so different from this case, where the

4

thing that is alleged is a general change in insurance

5

coverage that applies to everybody in exactly the same

6

way, and in the Barry case this Court said that is a

7

critical distinction, and yet our friends are just

8

overriding that distinction completely.

9

Justice Scalia put his finger on a critical idea

10

as well.

11

throughout this legislative history is that if a

12

consumer's house burns down and he can't get his insurance

13

money because the company is insolvent, it is cold comfort

14

to tell that person that vigorous Sherman Act competition

15

has saved him 5 percent on his premiums.

16

That's the solvency point.

One theme that goes

Congress meant these agreements on terms and

17

coverage that can preserve solvency to be considered by

18

specialized insurance regulators who can weigh these

19

sensitive questions of public policy that were debated a

20
