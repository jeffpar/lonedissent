ORAL ARGUMENT OF HENRY ROSE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ROSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The genesis of this action occurred when the

12

respondent employers withdrew from the petitioner

13

multiemployer pension and welfare benefit plans.

14

action, those withdrawing employers seek to require the

15

petitioner benefit funds to transfer a portion of their

16

plan assets to new benefit plans which are not parties to

17

this action which were established after the withdrawal of

18

those withdrawing employers.

19

In this

The district court granted petitioners' motion

20

for summary judgment.

21

reversed and held that a fair portion of the reserves

22

reflecting contributions made to the Greater Funds on

23

behalf of the Southern Employees should be reallocated to

24

the Southern Funds.

25

However, the Second Circuit

What is extraordinary and erroneous is that the

1

court below held that section 302(c)(5) of the Labor

2

Management Relations Act, 1947, was the controlling law

3

and that it required the transfer of assets.

4

says nothing about transfers of assets, nor does its

5

legislative history even mention such transfers.

302(c) (5)

The court below has not only misread section

6

7

302(c)(5) but has misread and misapplied -- failed to

8

apply -- this Court's decision in United Mineworkers v.

9

Robinson.

The focus of 302(c) (5) is specific.

In the

10

words of this Court in Robinson, 302(c)(5) was meant to

11

protect employees from the risk that funds contributed by

12

their employers for the benefit of the employees and their

13

families might be diverted to union purposes, or even to

14

the private benefit of faithless union leaders.

15

There's no such allegation in this case.

With

16

particular reference to the requirement in 302(c)(5) that

17

a benefit plan be maintained for the sole and exclusive

18

benefit of employees, this Court stated that its plain

19

meaning is simply that employer contributions to employee

20

benefit trust funds must accrue to the benefit of

21

employees and their families and dependents to the

22

exclusion of all others, and especially pertinent for the

23

instant action, this Court specifically concluded in

24

Robinson that nothing in 302(c) (5), quote, places any

25

restriction on the allocation of the funds among the

persons protected by 302(c)(5).
Even the narrow holding in Robinson is

applicable here.

4

authority under section 302 to review for reasonableness a

5

collectively bargained term of an employee benefit plan.

That is, that the Federal courts have no

That describes the present case.

6

The collective

7

bargaining agreements to which the respondent employers

8

were parties are clear that the terms of the trust

9

agreements are incorporated by reference, and those trust

10

agreements prohibit the payments that the Second Circuit

11

has ordered.
It is submitted that the trustees in this case

12

13

certainly breached no fiduciary duties in administering

14

the trust in accordance with their trust agreements.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Rose, if they had done so, would

16

there have been a remedy against them under 302 -- under

17

302(e)?

If the trustees had transferred

20

If they had transferred -- not

21

just transferred it, but had transferred assets to a union

official.

MR. ROSE:

To a union official --

So you -- it's your --

To a union official, that would

You see, I'm not sure what your

have - -

theory of the operation of 302(c) and 302(e) -- what you

6

theory is.

7
8

Does it not operate at all, once the trust is
established --so long as you establish a trust which on
its face meets the requirements, that's the end of the

10

application of 302, or does it continue to have some

11

application, at least if you violate the term of the trust

12

by turning over the money to union officials?

13

What's your theory?

14

MR. ROSE:

Justice Scalia, our position is that

15

section 302(c)(5) does not regulate the transfer of plan

16

assets whatsoever.

17

QUESTION:

Whatsoever, so long as the trust

18

is -- complies with the statute on its face.

I mean, on

1

its face the trust has to comply with the statute.

20

MR. ROSE:

That is correct.

21

QUESTION:

But so long as it does on its face,

22

if the officer -- if the trustee violates the trust, and

23

surreptitiously conveys money to union officials, you

24

think you can only get at that under ERISA.

25

MR. ROSE:

There -- it might constitute criminal

2

either under State law or under Federal law independently,

3

but you're right, I would relegate that to a regulation

4

under ERISA, clearly.

5

It might constitute a criminal violation

QUESTION:

So the subsection 302 regulates

6

solely the conduct of the employer in making the payment

7

in the first place.

8

MR. ROSE:

9

As we've noted, the section 302(c)(5) requires

That is its focus, absolutely.

10

employer contributions to be for the sole and exclusive

11

benefit of employees, but those are for the employees of

12

all of the contributing employers, and that is precisely

13

what the petitioner funds have done.

QUESTION:

I don't understand why it wouldn't

violate subsection -- Justice Scalia's hypothetical

16

wouldn't violate 302(c)(5).

17

held in trust for the purposes specified in the statute,

18

but were given to the union official as a bribe, they

wouldn't comply with the statute.

MR. ROSE:

Because the funds were not

think that would violate it.

QUESTION:

The money would have to be

goes beyond that and it's a payoff to the union leader,

why then, it would violate the statute.

The Second Circuit --

QUESTION:

Are you done answering that question?

4

MR. ROSE:

Yes.

5

QUESTION:

Can I jump in there?

6

MR. ROSE:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

I'm back to the same problem that you

8

gave one answer to and then took it back.

9

you want to stick with your second answer?

10

Are you sure

I don't see how the statute requires anything

11

except that the money be placed by the employer in trust

12

for that purpose.

13

MR. ROSE:

Well --

14

QUESTION:

If there's a violation by the trustee

15
16

later, does that necessarily violate the statute?
MR. ROSE:

Well, Your Honor, I think a strict

17

reading of the statute would come to the conclusion that

18

you are implying.

19

Arroyo and in Robinson that the specific provisions in

20

section 302(c) (5) are enforceable under 302(e).

However, this Court has stated in

QUESTION:

Enforceable against the trustee.

22

MR. ROSE:

Yes, and although I think there's

23

some difficulty, logically, coming to it, I don't think

24

that's a difficulty that needs to be reached in this case.

between this provision of the Labor Relations Act and

2

ERISA a little less neat.

3

MR. ROSE:

Yes.

Yes, I think that is right.

4

QUESTION:

Are they -- criminally, or simply in

5

equity, to enforce the trust?

6

MR. ROSE:

Well, section 302 is a criminal

7

statute.

8

to enjoin a violation of section 302.

However, section 302(e) allows injunctive relief

9

QUESTION:

So it's just equitable enforcement.

10

MR. ROSE:

Yes.

11

The Second Circuit has interpreted the solely

12

exclusive language so expansively as to judicially

13

legislate that there must be a reallocation of money in

14

the petitioner funds.

15

Neither the Second Circuit nor the respondents

16

explained how such a mandated reallocation is to be

17

reconciled with this Court's conclusion in Robinson that

18

nothing in section 302(c)(5) places any restriction on the

19

allocation of the funds among the persons protected by

20

section 302(c)(5).

21

QUESTION:

Under ERISA, would the trustees -- if

22

they had wanted to, could they have consistently with

23

ERISA transferred some funds and liabilities in this case,

24

this particular case?

If they had decided that they want to

do it, and there was a transfer of liabilities together

with the transfer of assets, yes, it may have been

possible.

QUESTION:

You say may.

Would it have been

consistent with ERISA?
MR. ROSE:

It would have been clearly consistent

with ERISA had they wanted to do it with regard to the

pension plan.

true with regard to the welfare plan.

There's some doubt as to whether that is

In the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments

10
11

Act, there is a specific procedure for doing so, and so it

12

clearly could have been done if in their discretion they

13

had wanted to make the transfer of both liabilities and

14

assets.

15

in - - without violating the prohibited transactions of

16

section 406 of ERISA with regard to the welfare plan.

There -- it's not so clear that they can do it

17

QUESTION:

Thank you.

18

MR. ROSE:

There is a specific exception, you

19

see, to 40 -- to the prohibited transaction with regard to

20

the pension plan, but there is none with regard to the

21

welfare plan.

22

It is submitted that attributing to the Congress

23

an intention in 302(c) (5) to regulate the use of benefit

24

best evidence, of course is the language of the statute.

Strongly mitigating against the Second Circuit's

8

expansive interpretation of 302(c)(5) are the dire

consequences that would follow.

The uncontroverted expert

10

testimony in this record is that the construction of the

11

Second Circuit would undermine the viability of

12

multiemployer plans generally.

13

Contrast such a result with the congressional

14

intention to preserve the financial integrity of

15

multiemployer plans not only by the enactment of 302 but

Act of 1980.

19

benefits to some 9 million workers and their families.

20

Congress was well aware of the importance of

Further indicating that 302 is not a regulatory

21

act is the fact that from the mid-fifties to the early

22

seventies the Congress and the executive branch became

23

increasingly concerned about the lack of regulation of

24

employee benefit plans, and this concern culminated in the

25

enactment of ERISA in 1974.

In the words of this Court in Teamsters v.

1

2

Daniel, quote, Congress believed that it was filling a

3

regulatory void when it enacted ERISA.

4

regulates the use of plan assets,

5

assets.

including transfers of

This is to be expected from a statute which this

ERISA includes at least five provisions that

8

bear on the transfer of assets ordered by the Second

9

Circuit, and each one of them would prohibit the transfer.
Thus, we have the anomaly of the court below

10

11

ordering the trustees of the petitioner funds to violate

12

ERISA and the Court's order would not be a defense to the

13

violation of the prohibited transaction.

14

that this result cannot be attributed to congressional

15

intent.

16

It is submitted

The judgment below calls into question basic

17

principles underpinning multiemployer benefit plans.

18

essence of multiemployer plans is the pooling of risks

19

among many employers and employees.

20

The

In typical multiemployer plans, employer

21

contributions do not reflect the differences in work force

22

demographics of contributing employers.

23

employer may have a work force with an average age of 50,

24

and another contributing employer may have a work force

25

with an average age of 30, yet they pay contributions at

For example, one

Contributions may be based on hours of service,

or ton of coal produced, or percentage of payroll, as in

the case of the petitioner funds.

Therefore,

for example,

it is inevitable

This is made

10

contributions in excess of the value of the benefits

11

received by their employees.
But the court below says that when an employer

12

13

withdraws from the plan, section 302(c)(5)

14

if the assets of the plan have increased during the period

15

of the withdrawal - - withdrawing employer contributing - -

requires that

19

According to the court below,

the proportion to

20

be paid is the ratio of the contributions of the

21

withdrawing employer to the total contributions.

22

Second Circuit's mandate could,

23

require that the petitioner funds pay out substantial

24

moneys even if the benefits received by the employees of

25

the withdrawing employers exceeded their contributions.

As a plan's obligations grow, normally its

2

assets also grow.

3

plan's assets which the court below would require the plan

4

to pay upon the withdrawal of the withdrawing employer

5

would also grow, and thereby encourage withdrawals and the

6

ultimate demise of the plan.

7

Thus, the proportionate share of the

The court below thereby would impose a new

8

obligation which the actuaries and trustees did not and

9

could not take into account when they were projecting the

10

cost of benefits to be provided and other costs in

11

determining the level of contributions needed to cover

12

those benefits.

13

If the plan's assets can be invaded in such a

14

major way as the court below has mandated, where will the

15

money come from to pay for the benefits the plan is

16

obligated to pay in the future?

17

It is to be noted that the Second Circuit's

18

holding is a one-way street. If the plan's assets rise

19

during the participation of the group of withdrawing

20

employers, the petitioner funds must pay out plan assets,

21

but if the plan's assets diminish, apparently no payment

22

to the petitioner funds would be required.

23

arrangement can survive under a system which requires

24

paying out of gains and absorbing all the losses.

It is instructive that the single circumstance

1

where Congress has mandated a transfer of assets from one

2

multiemployer plan to another, that Congress does not

3

define the appropriate amount of assets to be transferred

4

with reference to contributions or reserves.

5

The only situation where Congress has mandated

6

transfer of assets is where employees move from one

7

multiemployer plan to another multiemployer plan as a

8

result of a certified change of collective bargaining

9

representative.

10

In that instance, ERISA requires a transfer of

11

an appropriate amount of assets, and that term is

12

statutorily defined in section 4235(g) of ERISA, which

13

appears in the appendix to the petition at page 48(a) to

14

mean the value of the nonforfeitable benefits to be

15

transferred minus any employer withdrawal liability to the

16

transferor plan.

17

I might add that when it is the transfer of

18

nonforfeitable benefits, which is the same as vested

19

benefits, it is the transfer of the obligation to pay

20

those benefits and therefore it's the same as the transfer

21

of liabilities.

22

In the present case, no vested benefits have

23

been transferred to the respondent's new benefit plans,

24

therefore, even if there had been a certified change of

25

collective bargaining representative in this case, which

1

there was not, since it's the same union representing

2

both -- in both plans, the amount of assets required to be

3

transferred would be zero.

4

The expansive interpretation of 302(c) (5) and

5

the failure of some lower Federal courts to apply this

6

Court's Robinson decision has resulted in unnecessary

7

litigation and uncertainty among plan sponsors.
Some Federal courts even assert authority to

8

9

rewrite the terms of benefit plans when they deem them to

10

be unreasonable.

In effect, the Second Circuit has

11

stricken the provisions of the trust agreements barring

12

transfers of assets in this case.

13

In Mahoney v. Board of Trustees, just less than

14

6 months ago, the First Circuit held that a decision by a

MR. RICHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

Our position is that the plain language of

section 302(c)(5) of the LMRA requires that contributions

7

made by an employer benefit that employer's employees

8

either alone or jointly with, in a pool, as most

In the language of the syllogism that we used in

13

of the Greater Funds, both the pension and the welfare

14

your syllogism works.
MR. RICHMAN:

2

Those employees have withdrawn

3

from the plans, but they are entitled to benefit payments

4

that have been earned by them prior to the date of their

5

withdrawal.
In other words, they have vested in pension

calculated as of the date of the withdrawal.

16

They will not have the opportunity to

But the point is, is that under the

statute -- under the statute as you read it, these are

MR. RICHMAN:

They are employees of the

20

withdrawing employer, but as we read the statute, all of

21

the contributions that go into these funds must be used

22

for the benefit of the contributing employer either alone

or jointly with.

Some of these --

it, then it seems to me that the extension of your

1

argument is that even if some employees of a particular

2

employer leave, the result would still be to transfer the

3

assets.

4

MR. RICHMAN:

No, I -- we think that's a

5

different case, because if some of the employees remain in

6

the fund, they will be earning on the pension side benefit

7

credit.

8

opportunity to receive medical and other coverage.

On the welfare side, they will have an

9

The difference is, in our situation, there is no

10

one left who is available to earn a benefit beyond the

11

benefits that are already calculated in the liabilities of

12

the Greater Funds.

13

When only half of the employees leave, the half

14

of the employees that remain in the fund, for example, are

15

still entitled to medical coverage, and they may have many

16

catastrophic events that occur which create significant

17

liabilities for the plan.

18

therefore from our syllogism some of the employees of A

19

are benefiting in the pool with the other contributing

20

employers.

21

They are still in the pool, and

We believe that to be distinctly different from

22

our situation, where all the liabilities are fixed, and

23

there is no opportunity at all for the Southern Employees

24

to receive any benefit from the contributions that made

25

up - - that went to make up this surplus.

1

Mr. Richman, doesn't your theory

overlook the fact that subsection (5) is couched in terms

3

of money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund

4

established for these purposes?

5

6

MR. RICHMAN:

Isn't the reference to

If -- no, we don't believe so.

If

10

that were the case, the entire protective value of section

11

302(c) (5) would be essentially eliminated, because once

12

the money went in on Friday, if on Monday a union official

13

ran away with the money, 302(c)(5) would not apply its

14

protective value, which is reflected in the legislative

15

history.

16

QUESTION:

Well, how does 302(c)(5) help you if

17

the union official runs away with the money in any case?

18

Aren't we talking about contests about the enforcement of

19

certain terms of trusts, or the enforcement of certain

20

benefits as against trustees and employers, and so long as

21

the terms of the trust and the payments to the trust are

22

made in accordance with trust terms that satisfy the

23

requirements of subsection (5), isn't that all subsection

(5) is really trying to get at?

19

MR. RICHMAN:

If that is the interpretation

given to subsection (5), then at least a couple of the

the structural safeguards is that the money be held in

itself, a unanimous decision by this Court, in that case,

created a reasonableness standard to judge whether certain

can establish that.
MR. RICHMAN:

6

If that were the case, this law

was passed more than 25 years prior to ERISA, and we

believe that Congress thought that it was creating some

safeguards not only with the receipt of money, but that

10

the money would go into these funds, and then it also

11

would be used for the benefit of the employees for whom

12

those contributions were made.

13

And there are a number of statements, which

14

appear in our brief, in the legislative history from the

really thought that it was creating structural safeguards

which contributions which were made previously are not

12

being used for the sole and exclusive benefit of the

13

contributing employees who made those contributions

14

previously -- in other words, prior to 1985 -- and to read

the statute strictly, we'd end up in a situation where the

funds continued to receive contributions, have done so for

a long period of time, when contributions that were

at a time that contributions by A going in, previous

MR. RICHMAN:

That's correct.

We don't believe that ERISA requires a different

5

We can meet the requirements of the transfer rules under

district court would be able to deal with.
Our interpretation does not make section 1415,

MR. RICHMAN:

1

2

No.

We are arguing that this

transfer is in breach of 302(c)(5).

3

QUESTION:

Yes, which means that the trust --

4

the trust agreement was valid under 302(c)(5), and this

5

was in breach of it.

Is that right?

6

MR. RICHMAN:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Why don't you argue the opposite --

8

that it is not in violation of the trust agreement, but to

9

the contrary, it is fully in accord with the trust

10

agreement?

That means that the trust agreement is invalid

11

under (b), and therefore you would have to apply the (c)

12

exception.

13

MR. RICHMAN:

14

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I understand the --

In order to get 302 to apply, you

15

have to show that the trust agreement is invalid, so your

16

case ought to be that this payment was perfectly okay

17

under the trust agreement, but that renders the trust

18

agreement invalid under (b), unless the (c) exception

19

applies, which you say it doesn't.

20

Never mind.

21

(Laughter.)

22

QUESTION:

That's all right.

Well, on the interrelation between

23

(a),

(b), and (c), I take it the structure of the statute

24

is that any payment to the trust would be invalid under

25

(a), and that's why (c) is necessary to save it, isn't

The -- in answer -- in the dialogue just

preceding, Justice Scalia suggested that the argument that

might be made that the trust might be invalid and thereby

bring it within 302.

this trust is invalid, then virtually all multiemployer

With regard to the prohibited transaction,

though, I would add one point, and that is that this Court
