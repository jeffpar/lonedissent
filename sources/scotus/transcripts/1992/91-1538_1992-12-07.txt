ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. BEDERMAN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. BEDERMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner's husband, John Emmett Smith

11

travelled to Antarctica as an employee of a Government

12

contractor, and because of the Government's negligence

13

died in Antarctica.

14

This case comes under the Federal Tort Claims

15

Act, the sole avenue by which Mrs. Smith can sue the

16

Government, and concerns the proper construction of the

17

act's foreign country exception, which the Government

18

contends bar jurisdiction here.

19

Petitioner maintains that the sole purpose of

20

the foreign country exception is to ensure that the United

21

States' liability under the act is not governed by the

22

tort law of a foreign power.

23

Antarctica is a sovereignless region and has no civil tort

24

law of its own, and therefore Petitioner maintains that

25

Antarctica cannot be a foreign country for the purposes of

It is undisputed here that

1

the FTCA.
Now, averring to that point, the chief point,

2

3

that the sole purpose of the Federal Tort Claims Act's

4

foreign country exception was to prevent intrusion of

5

foreign law into domestic litigation, we believe this

6

conclusion is amply supported by this Court's only

7

previous opportunity to review the foreign country

8

exception, which was in Spelar v. the United States.

9

Moreover, petitioner submits that the emphasis on the

10

presence or absence of a foreign tort law leads to

11

consistent results, particularly when there is ambiguity

12

over the presence or absence of a foreign territorial

3
4

sovereign.
And thirdly, on this primary point, petitioner

5

maintains that Congress is well aware of alternate

6

formulations dealing with the notion foreign country, as I

7

aver permissive, or in its mandatory forms, and therefore

8

we can fairly interpret the foreign country exception to

9

apply in this case to an area that is sovereignless, the

20

one area on earth, apart from the high seas, we contend

21

that is sovereignless.

22

If this is the case and if these premises are

23

accepted, again it is undisputed in this case that

24

Antarctica is, in fact, a sovereignless area having no

25

civil tort law of its own.

Now, in view of this, petitioner maintains that

1

2

it is, in fact, the Government's position which leads to

3

illogical and peculiar results.

4

Government's position would be to interpret the act so

5

that Antarctica is a foreign country, which would have the

6

effect, the Government maintains, of barring Mrs. Smith's

7

claim.

8

9

The first instance of the

But it is clear on the record that if Mr. Smith
had died because of the Government's negligence just a

10

mile or two offshore of the McMurdo Station on the

11

southern ocean, that that claim would cognizable under the

12

Death on the High Seas Act, DOHSA, for the Suits in

13

Admiralty Act.

14
15
16

It seems --

QUESTION:

Is the -- does the Death on the High

Seas Act determine the law that will be applied?
MR. BEDERMAN:

The Death on the High Seas Act,

17

the law applies in such an action is the Federal General

18

Maritime Law --

MR. BEDERMAN:

Okay.

the Federal Tort Claims Act.
QUESTION:

And as distinct from this -- under

23

the Tort Claims Act and hence is distinct in this case

because there isn't any law in Antarctica.

QUESTION:

I mean there's no law -- there's no

2

tort law of the place of the tort, is there here?

So even

3

if you win on your argument, why don't you lose on the

4

ground that under the terms of the Tort Claims Act there

5

is no law that can be applied and therefore it must not be

6

intended to apply here?

7

MR. BEDERMAN:

Justice Souter, petitioner

8

maintains that the primary object of the Federal Tort

9

Claims Act is to place the Government in exactly the same

10

position as a private individual if that private

11

individual were a tort feasor.

12

There is no question that if this were a case

13

between Mrs. Smith and the Government contractor, here ITT

14

Antarctic Services, and that claim were brought in Oregon,

15

that the law that would be applied in this case under

16

either notions of personal sovereignty or under the

17

conflicts restatement balancing tests, is the law of

18

Oregon in this instance.

19

QUESTION:

Well that -- that -- assuming that to

20

be the case, the fact is we've still got the Tort Claims

21

Act, and that's not what the Tort Claims Act provides.

22

MR. BEDERMAN:

Agreed.

The Federal Tort Claims

23

Act's choice of law provision refers to the place where

24

the act or omission occurred.

25

case that the relevant act or omission occurred in

There is no dispute in this

1

Antarctica.

This is not a headquarters claim.

But we maintain that the logical reading of that

2

3

provision in the context with the foreign country-

4

exception and the rest of the statute, particularly the

5

object to place the Government in the same position as a

6

private individual, would be to allow the suit.

7

choice of law direction is clear and unambiguous.

8

seems to be no dispute that under the relevant choice of

9

law principles, the clear direction is to apply Oregon law

10
11

And the
There

here.
QUESTION:

No, but doesn't the -- doesn't the

12

reference to the law of the place of the tort include the

13

choice of law rule of the place of the tort, so you don't

14

even have a choice of law rule to begin with in this case?

15

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, Justice Souter, that's

16

clearly the holding in Richards.

17

petitioner does not dispute that holding nor does the

18

Government.

19

choice -- even though Antarctica has no choice of law

20

rules embedded in its law, because it has no law,

21

nonetheless the appropriate choice of law rule to advocate

22

is the notion of personal sovereignty, which obviously has

23

limited relevance today because there are virtually no

24

places in the world aside from Antarctica that have no

25

civil tort law.

And, of course,

What we believe is that implicit in the

Otherwise it is -7

QUESTION:

Well, how about Somalia?

2

suppose they have one right now?

3

MR. BEDERMAN:

Do you

Justice O'Connor, I would imagine

4

that despite the conditions in Somalia, no one would doubt

5

that Somalian sovereignty, as one would understand that,

6

is still intact.

7

we might not recognize it as such, still continues in

8

force and that it would -- petitioner's submission would

9

not be that Somalia, because of its current difficulties,

10
11

And Somalia's civil tort law, although

ceases to be a foreign country.
Again, the petitioner's position is that the

12

notion of looking for the presence or absence of a foreign

13

tort law only comes into play when there is ambiguity over

14

whether there is a presence of a - - of a foreign

15

territorial sovereign.

16

for you to apply -- to deviate from Spelar and apply a

17

bright line test.

18

The Government's position would be

But there are dangers in that that the courts in

19

this country have experienced, particularly a few years

20

back with the international legal status of Okinawa after

21

the end of World War II, where the courts struggled

22

mightily to determine whether the United States was

23

territorial sovereign on Okinawa, but ultimately concluded

24

that that issue was not important, as per Spelar, because

25

Japanese tort law was still in force.

Again, there isn't any concern in this case

1

2

about a foreign tort law intruding.

And, again, if -- if

3

one recognizes that the purpose of the FTCA is to place

4

the Government in the same position as a private tort

5

feasor, the Government's submission would basically make

6

Antarctica the legal equivalent of a black hole.

people are governed by no law there.

brought by Sandra Jean Smith against a private contractor,

And in a case

That is not

10

a result which is countenanced in Anglo-American

11

jurisprudence.
QUESTION:

12

That is,

Well, that -- that doesn't follow,

13

does it?

Because in a case brought against a private

14

contractor they wouldn't be stuck with the provision of

15

the Federal Tort Claims Act saying you necessarily have to

16

apply the law of the place of the tort.

17

MR. BEDERMAN:

would have no bar to such theories as personal sovereignty

and so on.

You'd be able to figure out some way to find

MR. BEDERMAN:

Well, Justice Souter, I mean not

23

to get into a discourse about whether the lex loci delecti

rule is still the rule adopted in the common law of most

25

American States, it seems to me that notions of personal

1

sovereignty and the conflict restatement test are

2

perfectly consistent with the choice of law direction of

3

the Federal Tort Claims Act.

4

As this Court recognized in Richards, it is

5

incumbent in - - sort of in view of the interstitial

6

character of the Federal Tort Claims Act and recognition

7

of sort of even what one might call a Federalism concern

8

in applying, in this case, Oregon wrongful -- Oregon's

9

wrongful death statute, that we can countenance a case

10

where it proceeds on some notion of personal sovereignty

11

or under balancing of factors.
The -- the other -- again, the Government's

12

13

position, it seems to me, is the one that suffers from --

14

from difficulties.

15

reconciling the -- the result if John Emmett Smith had

16

died on the southern ocean just offshore of the McMurdo

17

Station as opposed to having been unlucky enough to die on

18

land, that seems to be one powerful reason to -- to

19

interpret the foreign country exception.

20

consistently, we think, with its language, to include

21

Antarctica or to conclude that Antarctica is not a foreign

22

country.

23

Because of the difficulty of

And

Likewise, I've averred to what I regard as their

24

peculiar position that Antarctica has no law, and

25

necessarily following from that that in a case of a

1

private action, that no -- that no law could be applied

2

and the case would be nonsuited.

3

seems to me clear that the -- that the proper, the clear,

4

the consistent interpretation of the foreign country-

5

exception would be to hold that Antarctica cannot be a

6

foreign country.

8

That concludes my argument in chief.

QUESTION:

1

the foreign country exception and the presumption against

2

extraterritoriality lead to the conclusion that the United

3

States has not waived sovereign immunity for torts arising

4

in Antarctica.

5

Let me turn first to the FTCA and the foreign

country exception.

There's no question here that

Antarctica is foreign.

9

expanse of land.

It is also a country under the

Country also means sovereign nation, and

10

we acknowledge, as does petitioner, that -- that the

11

phrase can be read either way.
But the phrase shouldn't be read in isolation.

12

13

It should be read together with the other provisions of

14

the FTCA.

15

put it, it would be perverse to give the explicit

16

exclusion of foreign claims the consequence of expanding

17

the act.

18

together with the FTCA's choice of law provision and the

19

venue provision of the act, seems to us to lead clearly to

20

the conclusion that petitioner's suit is barred.

if I might.

It provides for venue in the place where the

It also provides for venue

plaintiffs were not U.S. citizens.

Congress didn't intend to waive sovereign immunity for

U.S. citizens might be covered overseas, but held that

that was not clear enough to overcome the presumption.

It's a waiver of sovereign immunity,

MR. BEDERMAN:

I hope just to - - Chief Justice,

I hope just to briefly aver to some points made.
First and most importantly, the Government

21

places very substantial reliance on what is known as the

22

Foley presumption, presumptioning its extraterritorial

23

application of Acts of Congress.

24

submission, as is evident on the briefs, that the Foley

25

presumption is not even implicated here, as this Court has

1

consistently said that the Foley presumption comes into

2

play when there is a risk of clash with foreign laws, and

3

there is no possibility of such a clash in this case.

4

And moreover, if Foley is read carefully -- the

5

Government has already alluded to the case being won

6

regarding the application of the 8-Hour Act to Iraq, the

7

Court in that case, Justice Reed writing, made it a point

8

to say that where the U.S. does have authority, in other

9

words jurisdiction based on nationality, that that

10
11

presumption would not be read in relation to the act.
In Antarctica the United States does have

12

authority by virtue of jurisdiction based on nationality.

13

As the Government has conceded already, Congress has

14

exercised that jurisdiction regarding taxation and in

15

criminal matters.

16

irrelevant in this case.

17

Again, the Foley presumption simply is

Now, likewise the Government places substantial

18

reliance on the venue problems, and the Government makes

19

the point that petitioner's submission would simply read

20

back into the statute language which had been dropped out

21

specifically by Congress, that language having to do with

22

a categorical ban on the claims of aliens.

23

Petitioner's submission does no such thing.

24

Petitioner is saying that where a claimant has a domicile

25

in the United States, venue is laid and the choice of law

canons go, in fact, to construing venue statutes and not

QUESTION:

It seems to me, in fact, to be an

And, indeed, in

Mr. Bederman, how do you respond to

the Government's argument about 1346(b), that the United

10

States would be liable to the claimant in accordance with

11

the law of the place where the act or omission occurred?

12

MR. BEDERMAN:

Chief Justice, my construction of

13

1346(b) is that if a private party would be liable as a

14

tort feasor in Antarctica -- to Mrs. Smith, say, as

15

plaintiff -- then it follows that the Government would

16

likewise be liable.

17

Antarctica -- pardon my colloquialism -- is not a legal

18

black hole, that law does apply there by virtue of these

19

choice of law principles.

20

QUESTION:

And as the Government has conceded,

Well, but the Government's argument,

as I understand it, is that there is no tort law governing
