CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Now Mr. Elden.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY M. ELDEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ELDEN:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

This case involves RICO and, in particular, it

11

involves what does it mean to participate in the conduct

12

of the affairs of an enterprise.

13

The case is here on writ of certiorari from the

14

Eighth Circuit which affirmed the summary judgment for an

15

accounting firm on the ground that they did not

16

participate in the conduct of the affairs of the Farmer's

17

Co-op.

18

think about the Farmer's Co-op is that it financed itself

19

by selling demand notes to its members.

20

Circuit held that the proper test was whether the

21

accounting firm engaged in the operation or management of

22

the co-op, but to understand the test I think it's

23

necessary to keep three facts in mind.

24

enormous number of facts.

25

I think without it, it's not possible to fully appreciate

The only relevant fact the Court needs to know I

how restricted the test is.
All courts agree -- and I'm going to use the

2

3

language of the courts.

So, this is not my version of

4

things.

5

that these facts a jury could have found:

6

Arthur Young "created" the financial statements of the coÂ­

7

op, not audited them -- not audited them, but created

The courts who gave the summary judgment agreed

Arthur Young invented the cost figures.

10

Arthur

11

Young, according to the district court, engaged in a

12

blatant fiction.

The records of the co-op showed that a

3

sale had occurred.

A multi-million dollar transaction had

4

occurred.

5

co-op insolvent was a sale.

6

tax returns, minutes, court decrees.

themselves, consulting no one, to ignore that fact, and

numerous other points that the district court made.

A self-dealing transaction that rendered the

20

financial statements, basically on their own without

21

consulting very much anyone else, which concealed the

22

insolvency of the co-op and concealed the self-dealing and

23

even crimes of the principals.

24
25

Second, the courts agreed that Arthur Young took
the financial statements it had created and used those

affirmatively to mislead the investors and the buyers of

2

the demand notes.

3

that's the court's word -- participating in the creation

4

of condensed financial statements, which everybody admits

5

were fraudulent and misleading.

6

no attempt to defend those.

7

They did this by participating --

Even Arthur Young makes

And they attended annual meetings where both

8

courts, Eighth Circuit and the district court, agreed they

9

lied in response to direct questions.

They deliberately

10

concealed facts from the investors.

The jury found --

11

there was not even appeal on the weight of the evidence.

12

So, it has become final -- that they did this with the

13

actual intent to mislead and deceive investors.

14

Eighth Circuit said that everybody knew that if the

15

investors were not told of the insolvency, they'd continue

16

to buy demand notes, and if they were told, there would

17

have been a run on the co-op.

18

QUESTION:

And the

Was this in cooperation with any

19

particular officer of the company who was doing the same

20

thing?
MR. ELDEN:

21

Your Honor, in this case, the

22

principal wrongdoer was already in jail when this

23

happened.

remained in office and who were at least guilty of

25

negligence if not collusion.

There were nine directors, five of whom

directors who were trying to get to the bottom of things

2

and tell the truth to people.

3

QUESTION:

You see, I'd find it easier to say

4

that they participated in the conduct of the company's

5

business if they were acting jointly with one of the

6

managers or directors, or at least an employee of the

7

company who was conducting the company's business.

8

could say they participated in the conduct.

Then I

But as you

cause with was gone, and they were just acting on their

11

own.
MR. ELDEN:

12

I would like to make it as easy as

13

possible for Your Honor to agree with me, but the truth is

14

that they basically did it - - they did 95 percent of this

15

themselves.

16

what they were doing.

17

up themselves, to protect their friends who were by then

18

gone.

19

No one -- there's no proof anyone even knew
They pulled off the fraud to cover

Now, Kirit Goradia did pull together some of the

20

financial data.

I mean, there was a lot of financial data

21

in the financial statements.

22

of it was straight.

23

But I think essentially the creation of the false

24

financial statements was virtually totally the work of

25

Arthur Young.

It wasn't all cooked.

Some

Kirit Goradia pulled that together.

out.

Is that fair to say?

MR. ELDEN:

QUESTION:

So that there was a motive I

Correct.
-- for the accountant to do what it

7

did even though it may not have been in a literal --

8

jointly sense -- literally jointly participating at the

9

time it committed the acts that you complained of.

10

MR. ELDEN:

Correct.

Your Honor, our view that

11

we presented to the jury was that the motive was to cover

12

up what amounted to crimes not only by Jack White who was

13

on his way to jail or in jail by then, but the lawyers for

14

Jack White who had suborned perjury who had put this whole

15

crooked deal together and could themselves been disbarred

QUESTION:

8

MR. ELDEN:

9

QUESTION:

May I just ask on that question?
Yes.
Do you take the position that

10

whenever an auditing firm creates financial statements,

11

that it has engaged in the pattern of racketeering

12

activity?

13

MR. ELDEN:

No.

In fact, I tried my best not

14

-- that -- Arthur Young tries to portray our position as

15

applying to the typical auditor.

16

an extreme fact situation.

17

an auditor can do that are perfectly proper.

18

can audit books prepared by others.

but it's not RICO.

It does not.

Arthur Young's statement of that in their briefs is the

proper role of the auditor.

By creating the books.

Is that --

By creating the books, doing it

catching themselves.
QUESTION:

Well, you say they can create the

books so long as they don't then audit themselves.

13

MR. ELDEN:

14

QUESTION:

15

Arthur Young went far beyond

fraudulently, and then auditing themselves, and not

11
12

I'm in complete agreement that

Your Honor, I think it is -It's sort of retroactively taken out

of RICO when somebody else later does an audit?
MR. ELDEN:

16

Your Honor, I'm not actually

17

speaking of a legal principle here.

18

accounting rules that the accountants set for themselves.

19

They allow themselves, to a small degree, to help the

20

client put the books together even though they audit.
QUESTION:

21

I'm speaking of the

Yes, but I don't think RICO was

22

intended to codify general rules of accounting practice,

23

was it?

No.
I have no indication of that.

MR. ELDEN:

It plainly was not.

It plainly was

not, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

I thought this provision here in

4

particular was meant to prevent a company from becoming an

5

evil mechanism, a company becoming a law-breaking company

6

as an enterprise.

7

someone in the company, you continue to work as an outside

8

auditor, I don't see how that comes about.

9

And when you're not working with

MR. ELDEN:

Well, in terms of whether outsiders

10

are covered, a point which Arthur Young has conceded -- so

11

have all the amicus -- the proceeding language in section

12

1962(c) talks about people employed by or associated with.

13

The classic RICO case, numerous predicate acts,

14

concerned bribers.

15

influencing only some aspect of the business, not

16

controlling the whole business.

17

QUESTION:

Bribers are normally outsiders who are

Well, that's true, but they are

18

working with someone who is a manager of the business or

19

an employee of the business with authority to conduct the

20

business' affairs.

21

that is corrupted.

22

MR. ELDEN:

So, you can say it is the business

Your Honor, in that case, I now have

an answer to Your Honor's question.

Sorry I'm so slow.

The board of directors had to adopt the report
of Arthur Young, and Arthur Young had to persuade them to

do that at meetings by misleading them and not telling

them the entire truth.

report.

QUESTION:

Arthur Young could not single-

Well, misleading them isn't the same

thing as making common cause with them.

7

bribe one of them, the two of you make common cause to

conduct the business in a -- an evil, unlawful fashion.

QUESTION:

Fraud you might be deceiving

Well, that's unlawful.

No doubt.

15

But I don't see why that becomes a RICO violation under

16

this section of RICO anyway.

17

MR. ELDEN:

Well, the -- taking 1962 as a whole,

18

all three sections refer to pattern of racketeering acts.

language, would you think the night watchman might be

2

covered or the elevator operator or anybody who committed

3

a pattern of unlawful acts?
MR. ELDEN:

4

No.

No, Your Honor.

In fact, the

5

word "participate," which has a half-century tradition

6

behind it and which was a word well-known to Congress at

7

the time they used it, plainly excludes people who are not

8

materially involved in furthering something.

9

has been used throughout all the -- all 50 States.

Participate

10

Numerous Federal statutes have participants as people who

11

materially aid or assist someone else who could be the

12

primary wrongdoer or could just be equal with them in

13

accomplishing something.

14

who -- just a person who goes out for coffee while they're

15

committing the fraud is not a participant under the

16

securities laws.

17

that way.

18

So, a participant is not someone

You don't even get to a predicate act

It's only when you materially aid and assist.
QUESTION:

But it could be at any level of

19

involvement, and you'd say that's involved in the conduct

20

of the enterprise's affairs?

21

MR. ELDEN:

I would say not the very lowest

22

level, but not necessarily confined to the highest level.

23

A person who effects a purchasing decision, bribes the

24

purchasing agent, is covered even though he doesn't also

25

handle marketing.

QUESTION:

1

Well, we're dealing with some pretty-

2

fuzzy language here I suppose, and the courts are all over

3

the lot in giving meaning to it.

4

Let me ask you this.

Do you think that the rule

5

of lenity should apply in our interpretation of the

6

statute - -

7

MR. ELDEN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Your Honor, I - -- and where it is fuzzy, maybe we

should err on the side of being careful before we extend
liability?
MR. ELDEN:

11

Your Honor, the rule of lenity is to

12

some extent at tension with the statutory command to give

13

liberal construction.

14

if by giving a liberal construction to certain words, a

15

person is able to come to a sensible meaning of them, then

16

it's not ambiguous and the rule of lenity -- in other

17

words, using Congress' guideline of liberality, if a

18

person is able to understand the words, then the rule of

19

lenity would not apply.

20

would.

21
22

23

QUESTION:

I think the way I reconcile them is

If it's still ambiguous, it

Well, I'm not sure how anyone would

understand these words just reading them.
MR. ELDEN:

Your Honor, I think unlike the

24

pattern of racketeering concept, which is a novel concept

25

in RICO and which is very difficult to understand, these

1

words all have been interpreted by courts in the same way

2

dictionaries interpret them, in the same way laymen use

3

them, and they're used in many other statutes.

4

concept of participating in the conduct of affairs is used

5

in the FIRREA statute that was just adopted.

6

concept has been used in the securities laws with no

7

problems, no one claiming it's unconstitutional.

8

Participate in the conduct of the affairs is fairly

9

straightforward English prose.

The

A similar

And I think that RICO as a whole is a very

10
11

complicated statute because of the pattern of racketeering

12

concept, and through the pattern to racketeering language,

13

which fortunately I don't think is before the Court today

14

- - and I agree that that makes the entire sentence very

15

complicated.
But assume for the moment we know -- let's say

16
17

it's stipulated that there's a pattern of racketeering

18

acts.

19

sentence is not hard to parse relative to other Federal

20

statutes.

21

Once that's stipulated, I think the rest of the

QUESTION:

But doesn't the notion of

22

participation require at some kind of minimum level an

23

action with other members of the management?

24

point that the accountants were doing things dirty, the

25

other members of the management who would have been aware

of duping the management, as well as borrowers and so on

management and the buyers of the notes.
MR. ELDEN:

8

9

So that weren't they in the position, as you

They

Your Honor, I agree with the first

comment Your Honor made, that at a certain very low level

10

of participation, I would agree it is not covered, and I

11

think that that is not simply a preference or - - I think

12

that is -- in the word "participate," as it has been used

13

for half a century, but it is sufficient.

If you --

But you are also acting in concert

18

with the people who have robbed the bank, and that analogy

19

doesn't hold here because they're not acting in concert

with the remaining members of the management.

21

in fact, acting for the sake of helping members of the

management who used to be there, but were gone by the time

they can - - gone by the time the auditors committed their

wrongs.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

5

Now, the issue before the Court today is whether

6

the Eighth Circuit was correct in holding that the RICO

7

statute requires that a defendant operate or manage the

8

business in order to be held liable under section 1961(c).

9

That holding, we submit, is wrong for several reasons.
First, it departs from the text of the statute

10

11

which does not use the words "operate" or "manage" to

12

describe the requirements for liability.

13

Second -- and I think this goes to Justice

14

O'Connor's question about the application of the rule of

15

lenity in this case -- the Eighth Circuit's holding

16

ignores that Congress used the words "operate," "control,"

17

"manage," "supervise," and "direct" in other parts of RICO

18

and in other contemporaneous laws, and I will detail those

19

laws in a minute.

20

requirements of operation or management for liability, it

21

did so explicitly, not as the Eighth Circuit did through

22

the back door by a gloss on words that do not contain that

sense.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

Well --

And there's nobody here who meets

8

that qualification, who was participated with by the

9

accountants.
MR. DREEBEN:

10

Well, first, Justice Scalia, the

11

statute covers two different ways of engaging the

12

enterprise in this pattern of racketeering activity.

13

First, it covers people who conduct the enterprise's

14

affairs.

15

QUESTION:

Right.

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Second, it covers people who

17

participate in the conduct of the affairs.

If, by

18

hypothesis, the accounting firm had become, in effect, the

19

chief financial officer for the company and was given by

20

the board the authority to create its financial

21

statements, which in effect happened in this case because

22

there was no one within the company to do that, the

23

accounting firm can be said to have conducted this limited

24

aspect of the company's affairs.

MS. OBERLY:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Court's task in this case is just -- is,

14

obviously, to decide what Congress meant when it included

15

the conduct requirement in section 1962(c), and the Court

16

needs to approach that task by choosing, from among all

the possible meanings that are set forth in the briefs and

18

the arguments, the one that most fits with a common sense,

19

logical understanding of what Congress had in mind.

20

Our position is that the Eighth Circuit's

21

operation or management test meets that requirement.

At least we seem to agree with the Government,

that the place to start here is with the language of the

they would have taken away from the in-house accountant

I'd like to note on the legislative history and

what is it that Congress had in mind here on the use of

the word "conduct" that the -- every synonym that Congress

7

ever used for the word "conduct" in the legislative

8

history is operate, manage, or run.

Eighth Circuit synonyms.

It's -- they're all

There is absolutely nothing in

10

the legislative history to suggest that Congress meant the

11

conduct requirement to be something less than operation or

12

management, to be just mere participation in the affairs,

13

as Justice Stevens asked a little while earlier.

as prescribing the operation of a business through a

explanation really from the Government about why the

catalog of RICO cases that they give us in their brief

21

would not fit -- every single one of them would not fit

would be covered by the Eighth Circuit's test because they

2

are either operating or managing the business or operating

3

under the control of a higher-up who tells them what to

4

do.

5

The Government is also concerned about the low

6

level defendants, although Mr. Dreeben acknowledges that

7

the Justice Department doesn't bring RICO prosecutions at

8

some de minimis level, but they have nevertheless

9

expressed concern about the small fry as the case is

10

referred to in criminal enterprises.

11

reason that those defendants as well would not be covered

12

by the Eighth Circuit's operation or management test

13

because even if they are not themselves operating or

14

managing or conducting because they're not at the top of

15

the hierarchy or anywhere near the top of the hierarchy,

16

they are operating under the direction of the people who

17

do run the enterprise, and they therefore participate

18

indirectly in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs.

19

And as I said, the Government really has not given us any

20

examples of RICO prosecutions that they bring or that they

21

even want to bring that would not be covered by the Eighth

22

It's clear I

clarity.

If there's any doubt about the Eighth Circuit's

2

test, then I do suggest that the rule of lenity is the

3

appropriate way to resolve that ambiguity in favor of the

4

Eighth Circuit's test.

5

This case is very similar to what the Court did

6

last term in Thompson Center Arms, construing a civil tax

7

case that had criminal implications, couldn't find a way

8

to resolve the ambiguity from either the legislative

9

history or the statutory language, and it used the rule of

10

lenity as a tie-breaker.

The situation is the same here.

11

If the Court is unable to conclude from the language,

12

purpose, legislative history of RICO, then the rule of

13

lenity ought to still lead to the same result as the

14

Eighth Circuit applied here.

saying the provision we're construing here has both

MS. OBERLY:

Right.
Therefore, the rule of lenity is

applicable.

Where liberal construction would apply is,

QUESTION:

2

MS. OBERLY:

Yes, but the rule of lenity --- give the statute a construction

3

that people can understand, the potential criminal

4

defendants can understand, then I don't think liberal

5

construction can be used to save a construction that

6

defendants don't know how to conform their conduct to.

7

QUESTION:

But the rule of lenity has been

8

thought to extend further than just a constitutional

9

prohibition against vague criminal statutes.

10

MS. OBERLY:

That's right, but in answer to

11

Justice Scalia's question about how do you reconcile what

12

Congress put in here about construing RICO liberally,

13

reconcile it by -- you can -- you'll do that as far as you

14

can, but at some point if you reach an ambiguity that's

15

going to put criminal defendants in a position of not

16

knowing what their conduct should be in order to escape

17

criminal prosecution, then that rule of liberal

18

construction is going to have to give way to giving

19

criminal defendants clear and understandable notice of how

20

to conform their conduct.

21

QUESTION:

No, but you don't -- you wouldn't

22

disagree with the proposition that Congress could say in a

statute the rule of lenity shall not apply to this statute

even though it's a criminal statute.

but I would still think it's important.

I -Limited to the provisions that are

MS. OBERLY:

I think the sensible way to

interpret is limited to civil, but even if you gave it the

broader interpretation, then I think the Court has to

11

still ask itself are we giving this statute a construction

12

that potential criminal defendants can understand.

13

can't invoke liberal construction and remedial

construction principles to come up with an interpretation

that potential defendants can't conform their conduct.

Well, I assume we should apply the

rule of lenity to this provision instructing us not to

apply the rule of lenity.

That's all I

Justice White asked about whether there was

evidence of keeping it afloat by fraud.

The point is

9

because of the novel way this case proceeded, we have a

10

final jury verdict that they originated the fraud --

11

that's right from the jury instructions -- with an actual

12

intent to defraud, that they deliberately concocted phony

statements with no actual belief in their truth.

Young did not appeal that on the weight of the evidence.

They conceded.

MR. ELDEN:

It's not -- it does not necessarily

I'm sorry.
QUESTION:

6

If I'm wrong,

May I ask this one question just --

was this motion for summary judgment granted before or

after the jury trial?

MR. ELDEN:

It

was renewed at the close of all the evidence.

11

agreed to reconsider, and then reaffirmed his previous

decision.

QUESTION:

The judge

So, the record that we look at is the

14

entire record or the record at the time of the original

15

motion?

16

MR. ELDEN:

Frankly, Your Honor, the records are

17

essentially the same, but we have cited to the trial

18

record for convenience all throughout the case, and we did

it again in this brief.

20

to confine the Court's attention, as far as I'm concerned,

people who can act authoritatively on behalf of the

I think there's three reasons why we can't.
The predicate acts, bribers and extortionists

people can merely be associated with the company.

can be outsiders.

That's conceded.

that Congress chose a word "participate" which helps
