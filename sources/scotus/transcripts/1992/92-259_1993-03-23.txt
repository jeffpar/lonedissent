ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. MILEY:

Thank you, Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves whether the State of Oklahoma
may tax the income of a tribal member who is employed by

3

the tribe, the Sac and Fox Nation, and whether Oklahoma

4

may impose motor vehicle taxes on automobiles owned by

5

tribal members of the Sac and Fox Nation.

6
7

9

The Sac and Fox Nation imposes its own income
and motor vehicle taxes, as the State does.
The lower courts have enjoined the -- Oklahoma
from collecting these taxes, and the State feels that this

20

injunction is improper for two reasons.

21

Federal law which preempts State law in this area, and the

22

State law - -

MR. MILEY:

Who are living where?

live on Indian country and some do not live on Indian

country.

QUESTION:

And the -- but it involves both --

all of those members.
MR. MILEY:

All tribal members.

We were

enjoined from taxing all tribal members who worked for the

tribe or any tribal members who properly license their car

with the tribe.

13

And those tribal members, some live off

Of course, we have a situation where Indian

country is scattered among several - - is scattered among

small plots in an area that is otherwise under State

jurisdiction.

19

QUESTION:

What are you including in the term

Indian country when you refer to it?
MR. MILEY:

That would be trust land, that is,

20

land that is held in trust by the United States of America

21

for the benefit of the tribe itself or for the benefit of

22

an Indian tribal - -

MR. MILEY:

areheld in trust

by the

Government

Yes, they would be or they'd be held

4

under an allotment deed, but the allotment deeds are quite

5

old.

6

are talking about allotted land also

7

But mainly we're talking about trust land, but we

QUESTION:

in thisarea.

If it's allotted, deeded, and not

8

held in trust, do you count that as Indian country as

9

well?

10

MR. MILEY:

Yes.

Under the Federal definition

11

under the Federal statute, 18 U.S.C., section 1151(c),

12

that land -- an Indian allotment is included in the term.

13

That's as long as the --

The Government holds title.

That is as long as the --

Now, that's true.

It. could be -- an

20

original allottee may have transferred that or it may have

21

been devised to a non-Indian --

MR. MILEY:

So, that's not -- - and BIA - That's not Indian country there.
Correct.

If the BIA --

QUESTION:

1

2

So, it still has to be in the hands

of a member.
MR. MILEY:

3

Correct.

And it has to be -- most

4

land we're talking about is held in trust by the United

5

States Government.
QUESTION:

6

What if the Government has conveyed

7

the patent to the allottee, but the allottee is an Indian?

8

Is that land still Indian country?

9

MR. MILEY:

Well, if the Indian tribal member

10

owns deed land, just the fee title to the land, and there

11

is no trust or restricted status to the land, then that

12

would not be Indian country just because the Indian would

13

own it.

14

QUESTION:

So, when you refer to Indian country,

15

you are not referring to fee lands owned outright by

16

individual Indians.

17

MR. MILEY:

Correct.

And even fee lands that

18

are owned by the tribe itself would not be Indian country.

19

That land would have to be accepted into trust by the

20

Bureau of Indian Affairs.

21

Oklahoma acquire parcels of land and hold it in fee.

22

has complete discretion whether to accept that land in the

23

trust if the tribe requests it.

24

it into trust, and sometimes the BIA does not.

25

must be held in trust to be Indian country.

Many times -- and tribes do in

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

2

QUESTION:

If you should lose with respect to

3

Indians who are living on trust lands, should you also

4

lose with respect to those who are not living on trust

5

lands?

6

important?

And if the answer is no, why is the distinction

7

MR. MILEY:

8

--we can make a distinction.

9

to the Indians on the trust lands, that would have to be

10

because they are within some sort of tribal jurisdiction

11

that is exclusive of State jurisdiction so that outside of

12

that territory on non-Indian country lands, then the State

13

of Oklahoma would have complete jurisdiction over that

14

individual.

15

individual person, not the tribe.

16

Well, I don't think the distinction
But if I lose with respect

And we're talking about the taxation of an

QUESTION:

So, you're saying the criterion

17

strictly is a territorial jurisdiction criterion, and

18

therefore you would not have to lose with respect to those

19

nontrust lands.

20

MR. MILEY:

21

QUESTION:

22

23

Correct, but -Is there any other competing theory

of jurisdiction?
MR. MILEY:

Well, here the tribe does not have

24

exclusive jurisdiction because I think we've got to look

25

at the Federal statute, the relevant Federal statute, so

1

that in this case even on Indian country within Oklahoma,

2

individuals living on Indian country are taxable by the

3

State in Oklahoma.

4

Now, that is because the allotment agreement, if

5

we -- which is the McClanahan case, set up the idea that

6

-- that case dealt with the Navajo reservation in Arizona.

7

And that Navajo reservation was set up exclusively for the

8

tribe, and the tribe was allowed to exclude non-Indians or

9

impose conditions on those that were allowed to enter.

10

Here the Sac and Fox Nation did have a

11

reservation which was established about the same time, in

12

the -- 1867, about the same time the Navajo reservation

13

was established.

14

- - Congress passed the allotment agreement or enacted the

15

allotment agreement which allotted all the lands of the

16

reservation to the tribal members at that time.

However, in 1891, the Federal Government

The tribe got about 800 acres.
Yes, all right.

Go ahead.

This is a fairly -- this was a

fairly large reservation in central Oklahoma.
But even giving acreage to the tribe, even

23

giving a quarter section to each tribal member, they had

24

huge amounts of land left over, and they opened that up.

President Harrison opened that up to the legendary land

Who are working for the tribe, and

some - -

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. MILEY:

And they are at issue here.
They are at issue because the lower

5

courts held that if you -- if the Indian or the tribal

6

member works for the tribe, they do not owe taxes.

7

Period.

8

9

QUESTION:

Now, what about tribal members who do

not live on trust land, but who are working for the tribe?

10

But does the same - - you run into the same problem about

11

the automobile tax?

MR. MILEY:

Right.

That's correct.

You do.
That's correct.

The way the tribal

scheme is set up - - well, you don't even have to be a

6

tribal member to get a tribal tag necessarily.

7

QUESTION:

Well, I know.

8

MR. MILEY:

But the --

9

QUESTION:

I know.

Unless you're a tribal member, the

20

State has no barrier to insisting on their paying the

21

excise tax.

22

MR. MILEY:

Right.

Yes, in terms of our own

23

taxes, we feel that even though you pay tribal taxes in

24

either instance, you owe the State taxes also.

25

we're talking about the tribal members on Indian country

Now, so

and off that are tagging their cars with the tribe.
QUESTION:

2

What is the significance of -- as to

3

the first tax, income tax, why is it significant that the

4

Indian who is living on the trust land works for the

5

tribe?

6

works for somebody else on the trust land?

7

contention that that Indian does not owe income tax?
MR. MILEY:

8

9
10

What if the Indian doesn't work for the tribe,
Is there any

Well, I think this case started out

much broader, and the tribe would argue that would be the
case.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MILEY:

Yes, I thought they would.
I would argue that -- well, and the

3

Tenth Circuit did not see it so broadly.

4

in order -- in this circumstance, where we do not have

5

this exclusive type statute, that the fact that they were

6

working for the tribe was the deciding factor as to

7

whether they were taxable or not because our tax somehow

8

infringed on tribal self-government.

9

QUESTION:

They felt that

It seems to me that the theory of

20

getting off is either a tribal self-government theory, in

21

which case you ought to get off whether you're on or off

22

trust land so long as you're working for the tribe, or

23

else the theory is a territorial theory, in which case you

24

ought to get off so long as you're living on trust land

25

whether or not you're working for the tribe.

1

MR. MILEY:

Okay, but this case does not fall

2

very neatly into the on/off dichotomy because people are

3

constantly going on and off the Indian country because you

4

cannot conduct your daily affairs of life in Oklahoma on

5

strictly Indian country.

6

of Indian country to do that because you've got 160 acres

7

of Indian country here and 160 acres down the road.

8

so, if you're living on Indian country, you're necessarily

9

going to have to go off to take care of any business.

You have got to proceed outside

And

So,

10

you have -- what we have here is a situation where Indians

11

are going off Indian country to work and to shop.

12

And what the tribe is saying in this instance

13

is, well, if they work for us, they don't owe any taxes,

14

and if they happen to buy something that they're going to

15

take back to Indian country like a car, then they don't

16

owe taxes either.

17

Well, that --

QUESTION:

What does the tribe say about people

18

who don't work for the tribe, but who live on Indian

19

country and go off and buy an automobile?

20

MR. MILEY:

Well, they would say that just

21

because they live on Indian country, they're within the

22

tribal jurisdiction, you see, and that they would not be

23

responsible for --

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. MILEY:

Well, how about on income tax?

QUESTION:

Do they claim that Indians who live

on trust lands, but who don't work for the tribe, and --

but live off of trust lands, away from trust lands --do

they claim that the State may not tax those Indians - -

They

would argue that because the person lives on Indian

country, that that would be exempt from State taxation.

Is that issue in -- is that at issue

MR. MILEY:

QUESTION:

20

MR. MILEY:

Well, no.

The Tenth Circuit --

-- among other things?.
The Tenth Circuit did not -- the

21

Tenth Circuit ruled that only those tribal members who

22

work for the tribe were eligible for this exemption in

23

this case because I believe they were having a little

24

trouble with the fact that we can't find an existing

25

reservation here.

For instance, in the McClanahan case, the tribal

member did not work for the tribe in that case.

earned all her income on the reservation, and because the

Federal Government, in their statute that created the

QUESTION:

9

MR. MILEY:

She worked on the reservation.

She

Sure.
- - the State was not allowed to come

in and tax her.

11

Well, the Tenth Circuit couldn't quite get there

12

with that case because we have the situation of the

13

allotment agreement.

14

QUESTION:

Well, under McClanahan, what if that

15

person who lived on the reservation, the Navajo

16

reservation, earned his or her income off the reservation?

17

MR. MILEY:

Off the reservation, they -- I

18

believe it's -- in Arizona they would pay the State income

19

taxes.

Well, is there -- did McClanahan rule

that or another case:?

If some other

case did, I would think it would control --

No, I --- control the issue in this case of

4

Indians who lived on trust land, but who were earned their

income off trust land.

MR. MILEY:

Well, I can't think of a case right

offhand that --

8

QUESTION:

Yes, all right.

9

MR. MILEY:

-- does that.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MILEY:

12

Go ahead.

Go ahead.

But in terms of the income tax here,

I believe this Court has already ruled -- well, the

3

Supreme Court has ruled in the

930's that -- in the case

4

of Leahy v. State Treasurer, which relied on Choteau v.

5

Burnet, where you had the situation of an Indian, an Osage

1'6

Indian, who lived on Indian country and earned income from

7

the tribal mineral resources, and he was taxable on the

8

income that he earned on those tribal mineral resources in

9

that case because there was not this type of reservation

20
21

that you have in the Navajo cases.
And then coming a few years later in Oklahoma

22

Tax Commission v. U.S., the Supreme Court also ruled that

23

members of the five civilized tribes would owe Oklahoma

24

estate taxes on their estates which included Indian

25

country, where they lived, their homestead allotments.

QUESTION:

1

2

3

Just one more question on this

preliminary part of your argument.
pardon me.

If we rule for you --

If we rule against you on your point, does

4

the case still have to go back to determine whether or not

5

you have jurisdiction to tax people that are in Indian

6

country, or do we have to -- we can remand for that, can't

7

we?

8

MR. MILEY:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, I don't -I mean, because if you don't have

civil or criminal jurisdiction over Indian country --

11

MR. MILEY:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- which I take it you don't, and

3

McClanahan says that's that the key for taxation, and if

4

the Tenth Circuit didn't reach that, we don't necessarily

5

have to reach that issue in this case, do we?

6

remand.

7

MR. MILEY:

We can

Well, I don't think I agree with

8

your reasoning that you've got to have civil and criminal

9

jurisdiction.

I think the whole basis of the McClanahan

20

case was that the Navajo treaty preempted State law.

21

so, in this case, we have an allotment agreement that did

22

away with that exclusive treaty and implies that State law

23

now applies, and we have cases, Supreme Court cases, that

24

suggest -- that I believe are applicable to this

25

situation, that conclude that State law, State tax law,

resolve the reservation issue of whether what - - to what

10

necessary part of a finding in this case.

I believe that

11

in order to reach the conclusion, if in fact State law

12

infringes on tribal self-government, you've got to find

13

the reservation where it is acting on, and I think you'd

14

have to have an exclusive reservation in order to -- if in

15

fact the State law will be an infringement on the tribal

16

government in this case.

17

And I don't think chat was what Congress

18

intended when they passed the allotment agreement.

19

think we've got to give the allotment agreement as broad a

20

sweep as the Congress intended that passed the act, and in

21

that case, they were terminating the reservations in the

22

State of Oklahoma to, in fact, create the State.

think the court was mistaken.

8

to believe that it was sufficient if the Indian earns his

income within Indian country irrespective of where he

resides.

In McClanahan itself, however, the Indian both

lived and worked on the Indian reservation.

12

It's common for States -- and Oklahoma is one of

3

these States -- to tax income on the basis of either where

4

the individual resides or works, and as long as that

statute is applied in an evenhanded manner, the

6

territorial principles, McClanahan would not bar the tax

7

if the individual either resided or worked off the

reservation.

9

We do think it's significant, however, that

20

Oklahoma affords a credit to a resident who works in

21

another State, but does not afford a comparable credit to

22

a resident who works for the Indian tribe.

23

example of someone who -- an Indian who lives off the

reservation, but works on the reservation, we would think

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's -- Oklahoma's own tax code

provides that, and the amicus brief filed in this case by

a number of States identifies that as a common practice.

But it's never -- you don't know of

for the person who is taxed by an Indian tribe.

Oklahoma does not do that for an

We think it's significant that in DeCoteau, for

show that that would not adversely affect the Indians

2

The per se rule, as it was stated last term in

really a penultimate outgrowth of the preemption rule of

Federal preemption.

the McClanahan, Moe, Colville series of cases through

On the other hand, it seems to me that if you do

not apply those cases to the Indian country generally, as

it has been defined by Congress and
