ORAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT H. MINTZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. MINTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case is about an issue of Federal common

12

law, whether the important interests of overall fairness,

13

finality of judgments, and judicial efficiency are best

14

served by the practice of routinely vacating the trial

15

court judgment when the parties settle on appeal, which is

16

the practice in the Federal circuit and applied below in

17

this case, or by a general rule denying vacatur on

18

settlement and preserving the potential preclusive effects

19

of the trial court judgment.

20

Petitioner urges the court to reject the Federal

21

circuit practice and adopt a rule under which vacatur is

22

not granted solely on the basis of settlement for three

23

principal reasons:

24
25

1)

Vacatur on settlement is inconsistent with

the Court's adoption of nonmutual collateral estoppel,

1

which strikes the balance between fairness, finality, and

2

efficiency in favor of finality when there has been a full

3

and fair opportunity to litigate an issue; and

4

2)

Although defended as achieving judicial

5

efficiency, vacatur following voluntary settlement

6

achieves only a false economy, because the cases in which

7

vacatur is most important are precisely the cases in which

8

there's most likely to be costlier future litigation, and

9

finally,
3)

10

Vacatur empowers a party who has lost on a

11

claim after a full and fair trial to simply buy out the

12

adverse judgment, defeat the policy's underlying

13

collateral estoppel, and then unfairly force parties, such

14

as Izumi and Sears in this particular matter, to defend

15

claims which already had been rejected.

Do you plan to discuss with us today

MR. MINTZ:

I would be glad to address that,

QUESTION:

MR. MINTZ:

Thank you.
Perhaps the background facts would

lead, in fact, into both the issue of intervention and set

forth the background for the issue on the merits, and I

MR. MINTZ:

Well, we believe that we fairly-

circuit's denial of intervention.

QUESTION:

of discretion to deny you intervention, is that --

MR. MINTZ:

QUESTION:

8

MR. MINTZ:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

So your point is that it was an abuse

Yes.
Is that -Yes.
Do you also agree that if it wasn't

an abuse of discretion, that's the end of the case here?
MR. MINTZ:

I think if we -- if the Court does

12

not find that the Federal circuit abused its discretion in

13

denying the motion to intervene, we would not prevail at

14

this level.

15

I --

QUESTION:

Why is that?

If we could take your

16

petition as being impliedly a petition to reverse the

17

lower court for abuse of discretion, why couldn't we

18

accept it as impliedly a motion to intervene here, and

19

even if they didn't abuse their discretion in denying it,

20

we would still be free to grant it, wouldn't we?

21

MR. MINTZ:

22

QUESTION:

Yes, I believe you are.
So why should we impliedly take it to

be the one rather than impliedly take it to be the other?

QUESTION:

2

MR. MINTZ:

Or either.
I would say --we certainly, in our

3

petition, intended to present the issue of the error of

4

the Federal circuit in not allowing us to intervene, and

5

to present to the Court what we thought was the principal

6

question, which is whether or not the practice of vacating

7

is an - - the way the Federal circuit does it is an

8

appropriate practice.

9

The Federal circuit itself, while denying the

10

motion to intervene, in fact when on and addressed the

11

practice that it was following, and then I think

12

categorically made clear that its practice is to

13

automatically vacate when the parties settle all claims,

14

and all the parties to the appeal.

15

Now, I believe there is at least one case that

16

I'm aware of, the Donaldson case, where it did seem to me

17

that the Court denied standing, I believe at this --at

18

the Court, and yet went on and did resolve the merits, the

19

underlying merits of the issue.

20

QUESTION:

What is the standard that we follow

21

in determining whether we should permit intervention

22

either here or, assuming we're reviewing the ruling of the

23

circuit court?

24
25

Is it by looking at Rule 24?

Rule 24 certainly applies to - -

MR. MINTZ:

Sears moved for summary judgment in

the Seventh Circuit, and the Seventh -- in the district

judgment on the basis of collateral estoppel in view of

And my question to you is, couldn't

12

you raise in the Seventh Circuit the very question that

13

you are now raising here, and if you are a party, and you

14

expressed some doubt whether you were or not, to that

15

interlocutory appeal, then you would not have the

16

threshold problem that you have at the moment.

17

MR. MINTZ:

But I think at that point the --

18

going up to the Federal Circuit the law of the case is

19

that the judgment has been vacated and we're dealing with

20

the very, very same practice, which is that in the case

where the motion to vacate was brought because of

if you weren't a party, you would not be bound by what

That's what gives you your present problem.

MR. MINTZ:

But

But the Federal circuit itself, in

5

terms of -- in this case, in the Florida case, having

6

vacated the.judgment of the Florida district court, I

7

don't believe that is -- that in itself would be an issue

8

in the case that came out of the Northern District of

9

Illinois, in which what had previously been a summary

10

judgment dismissing this trade dress claim was reinstated

11

by the District court in Illinois when the Federal circuit

12

vacated the very judgment that was underlying it.

13

think that on that appeal the issue would be whether the

14

Federal circuit should or should not have vacated the

15

judgment in the Florida case.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

7

No, to the Federal circuit.
The Federal circuit, not the Seventh

Circuit?
MR. MINTZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

So it's the same

court that had already vacated the Florida judgment.
QUESTION:

So basically it's your position that

8

if intervention isn't allowed somewhere there'll be nobody

9

to challenge the vacatur, because the parties, of course,

10
11

had stipulated to it.
MR. MINTZ:

That's exactly right, and that is

12

part of the - - I think of the problem of this kind of rule

13

in the Federal circuit and -- coupled with their refusal

14

to allow intervention by the one party that is most

15

affected by the vacatur, because in this case the

16

agreement between Windmere and Philips to vacate the --to

17

join in a motion to vacate the judgment followed a

18

settlement of a trade dress claim on which Philips had

19

lost and an antitrust claim on which Philips had lost.

20
21

22

Certainly the trade dress claim is the kind of
claim that is subject to a possible preclusive effect.
QUESTION:

Couldn't it conceivably be

23

challenged?

24

Justice that if we don't allow the challenge here nobody

25

can challenge it.

I mean, you agreed readily with the Chief

I understand why you would agree readily, but

1

2

why wouldn't you be able to challenge it in the later

3

proceeding by simply alleging that the vacatur was

invalid, and that therefore there is collateral estoppel

Why wouldn't that be a conceivable manner of

1

validity of the vacatur was raised in the Illinois

2

district court case.
In other words, the Illinois district court case

3
4

proceeded on the basis that here was the Federal circuit

5

vacating the judgment, the judgment is now vacated, but

6

nonetheless, in these circumstances the collateral

7

estoppel should apply, and I don't believe that the attack

8

was that it was an invalid -- in effect an abuse of

9

discretion by the Federal circuit to have actually vacated

10

that judgment, and I don't -- I think the proceeding

11

before the Federal circuit then on the interlocutory

12

appeal, on the argument which the Federal circuit already

13

addressed in this case that vacatur is not appropriate in

14

the settlement situation is really not a practical -- it's

15

not going to be a practical route to any change in that

16

result.

17

QUESTION:

The only way you could get relief

18

would be to ultimately get this Court to grant certiorari,

19

certainly the district court in the Northern District of

20

Illinois where the appeal lies from its judgment to the

21

Federal circuit isn't going to decide that the Federal

22

circuit authorized something that's contrary to law, and

23

presumably the Federal circuit is not going to change its

24

mind, either.

MR. MINTZ:

Yes, that's the assumption that I

1

would make, but I believe that the case as it stands now,

2

I think presents to the Court the really precise issue of

3

the fundamental problem with a practice that - - where an

4

appellate court will automatically in essence vacate when

5

the parties to the appeal settle and they settle all the

6

claims on appeal, and the problem with this basic rule is

7

that it does in effect vitiate the collateral estoppel.

8

Collateral estoppel is grounded on preserving

9

judicial and litigants' resources and not allowing

10

relitigation of fully and fairly tried issues, and when we

11

are dealing with judgments that have potential preclusive

12

effect, the vacatur eliminates even the possibility of

13

applying collateral estoppel in the subsequent case, and

14

we say that vacatur is not a fair price to pay for

15

settlement because in the cases where vacatur is sought,

16

most likely there will be further litigation, and the

17

appeal is not in any event necessarily saved, which is one

18

of the theories of preserving or fostering efficiency

19

through settlement on appeal and saving the appellate

20

court's time in deciding the case.

21

QUESTION:

The appeal --

I take it the logic of your rule

22

would prohibit vacatur even in the district court after a

23

final judgment has been entered.

So in all -- what is the practical

consequence of the vacatur, other than to deprive the

5

MR. BEENEY:

That is quite correct.

That is the

6

only practical significance, but Izumi, in the currently

7

pending Federal circuit appeal, takes the position, as it

8

did before the district court in Illinois, that a vacated

9

judgment under these circumstances ought to continue to

10

have collateral effect.
And if, indeed -- if the Federal circuit accepts

11
12

Izumi's position that the vacated judgment does not --

13

does continue to have collateral effect, then Izumi has no

14

interest here whatsoever, because then the vacated

15

judgment would be applied collaterally in Illinois, and

16

their interest in the case that comes from Miami is

17

completely vanished, because there is no interest

18

whatsoever in that case, other than an attempt to use the

MR. BEENEY:

3

QUESTION:

That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.
So it's a little odd to me to say

4

that Sears, that was totally out of the Florida

5

litigation, would be a proper intervenor in the Federal

6

circuit litigation and Izumi not, although initially Izumi

7

was a party, and in fact is being told in the Illinois

8

court, you can't raise your antitrust counterclaim here

9

because you were originally in the Florida action, and

10
11

should have raised it there.
MR. BEENEY:

Well, I think I would make a

12

distinction as to the timing of intervention.

13

14

that they would not provide discovery as a party.

They insisted

So they made every effort to make it clear that

19

they were not a party, the obvious reason being that

20

should Windmere prevail on the claim, Izumi hoped to use

21

that collaterally, but they wanted to avoid any collateral

22

effect should Philips prevail on the claim.

23

At the time at which a motion is made, however,

24

to vacate the judgment, that is the point in time in which

25

Sears' interest arises, not in the underlying claim

QUESTION:

Do you argue for a rule of automatic

10

vacatur in all cases, if the parties so stipulate, or is

11

the Ninth Circuit Approach the preferred approach?
MR. BEENEY:

12

We would argue for the firm rule,

13

Justice Kennedy.

14

being advocated by the United States, which is essentially

15

that when complete settlement among the parties moots an

16

appeal, the judgment ought to be vacated.

17

also ought to be vacated when the prevailing party below

18

unilaterally takes steps to moot the appeal, thereby

19

depriving the appealing party of their right to appeal.

QUESTION:

8

Rule 60 talks about whether it's any

longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective
10

application, and that would seem to me to be inconsistent

11

with an automatic rule of vacatur that you are asserting

12

here.

13

MR. BEENEY:

Well, I think the automatic rule

14

has much to say for it for the very reasons of certainty.

15

First of all --

16

QUESTION:

It may have much to say for it, but

17

I'm pointing out that that takes away the effect of the

18

language in Rule 60 that the district court is to

1

determine whether it's equitable that the judgment should

20

have prospective application.

21

MR. BEENEY:

Well, I think Rule 60 could be read

22

vis-a-vis these circumstances in that it is always just

23

and equitable to vacate when all parties to a settlement

24

moot their appeal, and that's the way I would urge Rule 60

25

to be read in this context.

That's not

persuasion, it's compulsion, and I gather you are now
saying that that's the effect of a vacated opinion.
MR. BEENEY:

As I meant to say originally, if

the reason for vacating the opinion has nothing to do with
the merits of the decision, it ought to continue to have
whatever effect it had with or without the judgment
attached to it, and if I may get back, Justice Kennedy, to
the question as to why this ought to be a firm rule, it
does, we believe, offer quite a bit of advantages to the
system.
It allows parties to know that they can settle
and vacate and remove whatever question there may be,
thereby encouraging settlements, and it also permits the
courts of appeals not to engage in the type of collateral
litigation that they would have to in balancing the
various interests.
QUESTION:

In your view, Mr. Beeney, should

there be any obligation to give notice to third parties
who might be affected by the vacation of the judgment?
MR. BEENEY:
QUESTION:

No, Justice -They're the only ones who really have

an interest in whether it should be reached -- preserved
or not.

QUESTION:

Presumably the parties paying to get

the judgment vacated would have a pretty good idea who
might be affected by it.
MR. BEENEY:

They may or they may not, and

again, involving the appellate court who receives the
motion, and the collateral issue of whether adequate
notice has been given, or who the parties who may be, I
think is just not a workable rule.
QUESTION:

Mr. Beeney, could I ask you the same

question that was asked to Mr. Mintz?
are you arguing for?

What kind of a rule

Are you arguing for an absolute rule

that whenever the parties seek vacatur, both the parties,
it must be granted, always and invariably?

wouldn't preclude the -QUESTION:

that, so long as it applies -(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Mr. Beeney, isn't it only fair,

though, if you're able to wipe out the preclusive effect,
so should Izumi, and it shouldn't be stuck by the
compulsory counterclaim rule?

If the Florida adjudication

is not going to have any effect on you, shouldn't it
equally have no effect on Izumi?
MR. BEENEY:

I think the counterclaim rule,

Justice Ginsburg, goes to a different point, and therefore
I would argue your -- I would answer you question, no, I
don't think it's unfair.
The counterclaim rule is intended to encourage
all parties to present disputes that they have among each
other.

At the same time, the rule starts at the time of

the filing of the complaint, so regardless of whether the
case proceeds to judgment, even if the case is settled
before judgment, the compulsory counterclaim rule would
still apply, so it's not attached to the judgment, it's
attached to the filing of the complaint.
The interests that are served by the firm rule
include several that would advance the system of
litigation.

It promotes fairness among the parties, and

because it encourages settlement, it conserves private and
judicial resources.

QUESTION:

So then, this rule is not necessary

to promote a larger number of settlements, merely promotes
settlements taking a somewhat different form?
MR. BEENEY:

No, I think it does have a profound

effect on promoting the number of settlements.

As Judge

Winter said for the Second Circuit in the Nestle opinion,
as United States has said in its brief before this Court,
and as the more than a hundred cases that we cite in our
brief stand for the proposition, that this rule does
encourage settlement, and it allows parties to abandon the
judgment and settlement the dispute on their own terms and
thereby forever removing the dispute from the courts in a
consensual rather than a coercive way.
QUESTION:

But it'll only prompt those

settlements in those cases where the effect of the
settlement will be to enable future district court
litigation.

Sure, it'll always foster settlement in the

particular court of appeals, but only when -- only when
the effect of the settlement will be to promote further
litigation in the district court, isn't that true?

case, where the case is not truly moot, because the very
same issue may - - the very same circumstances could arise
again.
QUESTION:

Well, it's truly moot.

That isn't

the point I think Justice Ginsburg was making.

It is

truly moot, but it's a different kind of mootness from the
mootness that occurs without the cooperation of the
parties, and not necessarily the kind of mootness that
calls for a Munsingwear vacation of the judgment.
MR. HUNGAR:

This Court has applied Munsingwear

in cases where mootness occurs as a result of the conduct
of one of the parties.

Indeed, Munsingwear itself

involved mootness that occurred as a result of the conduct
of one of the parties, the United States, and the Court in
numerous other cases that we've cited in our brief -Deakins v. Monaghan, the Webster case, the Frank v.
Minnesota Newspaper Association case, cases decided on the
merits as well as the summary opinions issued by the Court
in settlement cases, all show that Munsingwear is not
limited to the context of mootness that occurs for reasons
outside of the litigation, that even where a party -- for
instance, in the Frank case where the Government changed
its position with respect to the interpretation of a
statute, and the plaintiff then said well, we are no

satisfied with the Government's new position, this Court
did not merely dismiss the appeal as the winning party
below had suggested.

Rather, the Court vacated the

judgment below, applying Munsingwear, because -QUESTION:

You're saying we've always done that?

Aren't there earlier cases where we haven't vacated?
MR. HUNGAR:

There are two cases of which I'm

aware, one in the 1800's and one in 1911, in which the
Court dismissed the appeal, but that doesn't indicate that
the Court has not followed the consistent practice of
vacatur when the parties request it.
QUESTION:

We really haven't focused on this

issue before though, have we?

Isn't it fair to say that

we really haven't focused on that issue?
MR. HUNGAR:

The Court has not addressed, after

full briefing and argument, this precise question, that's
correct, Your Honor.

The Court has, however, followed a

consistent practice for at least 50 years or more,
certainly since the 1930's, and there's no indication that
the Court has ever rejected this approach.

least in the questions presented, suggests that the Court

2

could deem -- easily could waive the question, but the

3

Court could either, as Justice Scalia suggested, treat the

4

petition for certiorari as an implicit motion for

5

intervention in this Court, or could conclude that the

6

intervention question was somehow included in the question

7

that was presented in the petition implicitly and

8

therefore reach that question as well.

9

We agree, of course, that -QUESTION:

10

On the merits, Mr. Hungar, of course

11

the problem of the court of appeals not having specific

12

standards would be resolved by the rule the petitioner

13

argues for that there be no vacatur in any circumstance,

14

and what is your principle objection to that rule?

15

you concerned in part that there might be judgments that

16

are incorrect, or not well-founded, that become

17

controlling law, or are you -- or is that a concern?

18

MR. HUNGAR:

That's one of the concerns.

Are

We

19

believe that the problem with petitioner's position is

20

that it places the interests of third parties and the

21

principles and concerns underlying the doctrine of

22

nonmutual collateral estoppel above the interests of the

23

parties to the case precisely in circumstances where the

24

premises for application of collateral estoppel do not

25

apply.

1

The premises for collateral estoppel are that

2

application of that doctrine will ensure consistency of

3

judgments, that we have reason to be confident in the

4

correctness of the first adjudication, and that it will --

5

QUESTION:

I was going to suggest that on

6

that -- the law of collateral estoppel can accommodate

7

those concerns.

8

if there is some underlying basic concern with the

9

judgment, so it seems to me that your principal argument

10
11

Collateral estoppel just will not apply

is that you just want to facilitate settlement.
MR. HUNGAR:

Well, that's correct, Your Honor,

12

because leaving this question to be adjudicated when it

13

comes up again in the future -- that is, denying vacatur

14

but leaving the parties free to relitigate the collateral

15

estoppel effects -- will not provide the certainty that is

16

necessary for parties that will not be willing to settle

17

unless they can obtain vacatur and be certain that

18

collateral estoppel will not be applied in the future.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Hungar, why would --

20

QUESTION:

Is it desirability of settlement

21

which is driving your position?

22

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, it's the desirability of

23

settlement and certainty combined with the fact that the

24

premises underlying nonmutual collateral estoppel do not

25

apply here.

1

Just as in the Mendoza case, where this Court

2

held that nonmutual collateral estoppel would not be

3

applied to the United States because when the United

4

States is a party, there are countervailing

5

considerations, such as the fact that the United States

6

will bring many more appeals, thereby reducing the

7

judicial economies that might otherwise be served by

8

collateral estoppel, just as in the Mendoza case, where

9

the Court adopted a bright line rule that said, because of

10

these countervailing considerations, nonmutual collateral

11

estoppel will not apply, we suggest that by parity of

12

reasoning in this case, the Court should conclude that

13

parties should be permitted to avoid nonmutual collateral

14

estoppel by obtaining vacatur because the premises for

15

nonmutual estoppel are not furthered here, and because the

16

interests of certainty and fairness furthered by

17

permitting settlement would be achieved by adhering to the

18

Court's general rule of vacatur.

19

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't it pay the Government,

20

in all cases where it gets an adverse decision in a

21

particular district and it doesn't want to have to abide

22

by that decision, to agree to do whatever action the suit

23

requested and -- in exchange for the winning parties

24

agreeing to the vacatur?

MR. HUNGAR:

Your question is, why wouldn't it

QUESTION:

Yes.

I'd do it all the time, if I

W

were the Government.

MR. HUNGAR:

QUESTION:

Well, in many cases -Why suffer an adverse judgment?

Just

6

agree with the other party.

7

ahead and do what you wanted to do.

8

thing off the slate so the Government agencies won't be

9

bound by this district court judgment.

10

MR. HUNGAR:

Okay, you won, you can go
Let's just wipe this

Well, in some cases, Your Honor,

11

the deposing party may not be willing to agree to vacatur,

12

in which case our rule would not apply.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HUNGAR:

15

QUESTION:

No, but very often they would be.
Again, Your Honor -The expense of litigation, you're

16

giving them all that they want.

17

MR. HUNGAR:

We see little likelihood that the

18

Government is going to routinely take the approach, but of

19

course it would in some circumstances where, because it

20

believes there is substantial doubt about the correctness

21

of the judgment below, or for other reasons --

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

We'll always believe that.

Well, if you're wrong about the

precedential effect of a vacated judgment, then certainly

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF HERBERT H. MINTZ

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. MINTZ:

Thank you, Your Honor.

9

Just one point, and that is that the --a

10

settlement of this type, which basically goes to the

11

quantum of damages that were awarded for the antitrust

12

violation, essentially buys out the adversarial interest,

13

or incentive of the other party and allows through the

14

settlement a claim such as the trade dress claim, which

15

would be the subject of defensive nonmutual collateral

16

estoppel, an asserted right by the party that lost,

17

resuscitated just for the payment of enough money to

18

satisfy the other party, and the only real interested

19

parties who would be adversaries are the parties like

20

Sears and Izumi, who are directly affected, and have

21

already been shown to be affected,

22

where that trade dress claim, once dead, has now come back

23

to life, and that's why we say the vacatur on settlement

24

rule completely undermines and is very much inconsistent

25

with collateral estoppel, and the rule should be

to be
