Why do you say it's viewpoint-based,

Mr. Staver?

13

MR. STAVER:

Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice,

the

reason why it's viewpoint-based is, Judy Madsen is

MR. STAVER:

9

QUESTION:
MR. STAVER:

10

Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do.
Why?
The reason is, is that Judy Madsen

11

cannot ever enter that zone, whereas other individuals

12

expressing a contrary view can.
QUESTION:

13

Well, but on your theory, every

14

injunction, whether it's in the labor context or any other

15

context, would be viewpoint-based, and I don't think we've

16

ever thought that injunctions of that type became content -

17

based just because they were focused on a named

18

individual, or a group of individuals.

MR. STAVER:

Justice O'Connor, it wouldn't be

viewpoint-based on every injunction.

restriction that says you can't make noise within that

zone, or something of that sort.

4

MR. STAVER:

Your Honor, on - - Justice O'Connor,

5

on page 24 of the respondent's brief, they specifically

6

address the types of images that would be impermissible

7

under this injunction.

8

would be impermissible are those that tend to traumatize.

9

Who makes that determination but the listener's

10

reaction to speech, and the listener's reaction to speech

11

could never be a content-neutral basis for regulating an

individual's

QUESTION:

They state that the images that

I think you're really spreading this

14

content-based and viewpoint thing all over the First

15

Amendment area, rather than confining it. I mean, it seems

16

to me that answer is really a vagueness challenge, rather

17

than a viewpoint-base challenge.

18

MR. STAVER:

Mr. Chief Justice, we raise the

19

vagueness challenge as well as a viewpoint-base challenge,

20

and I believe in this particular case, looking at

21

Justice --or Judge McGregor, who drafted this injunction,

22

he clearly stated that it applies to a belief, not

23

specifically activities or individuals.

24

those beliefs that seem to be supportive of prolife.

1

based on the fact that the injunction enjoined only those

2

who wanted to protest against abortion and not those for

3

it?

4
5

MR. STAVER:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, that's not

the basis of the challenge.

6

The basis is that in the internal workings of

7

the injunction itself, it says that when someone enters

8

this zone -- for example, Judy Madsen -- she can only

9

speak if that individual listener shows a positive

10

interest in what she has to say.

11

therefore, is empowered with ex parte adjunctive authority

12

to censor her speech.

13

QUESTION:

That listener,

That's the 300-foot zone, Mr. Staver,

14

but what about the 36-foot zone, which is what Justice

15

O'Connor was asking about.

16

MR. STAVER:

Justice Scalia, the 36-foot zone

17

would be the same way.

18

and applied that 36 --

20

QUESTION:

The way Judge McGregor intended

Well, she's not allowed within that

zone at all.

21

MR. STAVER:

22

QUESTION:

She can't ever go within that zone.
Okay, so that's -- you can't say that

23

that's content-based because she can only go in if the

24

people agree with her.

25

MR. STAVER:

She can't go in at all.
No, she can't go in at all.

1

QUESTION:

So why is it content-based?

2

MR. STAVER:

Because of -- the only reason she

3

can't go in has nothing to do with her activities but

4

solely because of her belief.

5

QUESTION:

Judge McGregor --

In that extent, every injunction

6

that -- if you enjoin a labor union where there's been

7

violence on the picket line you're only directing the

8

injunction against somebody that has a particular point of

9

view.

10

Doesn't it always -- isn't it always content-based

where it's an injunction?

11

MR. STAVER:

QUESTION:

MR. STAVER:

(2)

I believe, Justice Scalia.
Okay, but why did you say no before?
No, well, in the sections (1) and

QUESTION:

It seems to me you say yes, and

16

that's why we have to be especially careful with

17

injunctions.

18

MR. STAVER:

Sections (3) through (9) would be

19

the content-based.

20

not be, because that simply restrains an activity and not

21

individual speech, which we are not challenging.

QUESTION:

Sections (1) and (2) I would say would

May I ask you a question that seems

23

to be the premise - - one of the premises of your argument

2

offer them, and could not speak, but as I'm reading the

3

reference, and I'm on A-9 of the petition appendix, under

4

paragraph (5) on the 300-foot -- covering the 300-foot

5

zone, there's an injunction against physically approaching

6

any person seeking the services of the clinic, but I don't

see anything in there that prevents your clients from

not.

That's true in part, Justice

make.

7

MR. STAVER:

Justice Souter, the next sentence

8

goes down and basically says such invited contact by a

9

10

contact at such person's residence is limited to conduct

11

They can't -- but they couldn't

Mr. Staver, you've several times

So my first question is, did you propose, when

you got this injunction, any modifications to clarify the

the original injunction, what remedy would have been

MR. STAVER:

6

Justice Ginsbug, let me answer both

7

questions, and looking at the second one first, there is

8

no conceded violation of the first injunction.
On page 375 of the Joint Appendix, respondents

10

specifically stated that the contempt proceedings

regarding any violations of the 1992 had nothing to do

with Judy Madsen.

testified.

modification of the amended injunction if it was entered

before she was even around the place?

14

MR. STAVER:

I don't believe that she really

15

could, and I believe that it would have bee futile to do

that, because Judge McGregor, a few days after this

you're seeking just to excise those three people from the

MR. STAVER:

12

No, Justice Ginsburg, it is not,

MR. STAVER:

No.

She could be held in concert,

internal operations of this, that seems to be inconsistent

with your insistence that you didn't need to put very much

MR. STAVER:

Justice Ginsburg, we've argued to

Court was before the court of Florida, and the same

12

arguments were made, and we asked them to de novo review

13

this case.

14

The only pieces of testimony that were not

15

before the Florida supreme court was that of Arick, Doyle,

16

and Wymer, but respondents specifically stated that

17

testimony had nothing to do with petitioners.

18

This particular court, as well as the Florida

19

supreme court, had the testimony of April 12th, the record

20

and the comments by Judge McGregor, and all the testimony

21

that was before this particular court except for those

22

other three testimonies, so the record evidence, looking

23

at it de novo, does not show that the injunction was

24

constitutionally applied properly to the three

petitioners.

You're saying that "in concert"

cannot be used in an injunction?
MR. STAVER:

10

No, it certainly can, if it's used

properly according to this Court's decision in Chase.

12

Chase, this Court looked at how an in-concert application

13

could be used, and that it should not be used to attempt

14

to restrain the entire world who simply receives notice of

an injunction, but it should be used if proof was shown

that someone was actively in concert, aiding and abetting.

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

11

Your Honor, in introduction I

13

Justice Stevens in Hirsh v. City of Atlanta mentioned that

time, place, and manner should apply to injunctions as

16

It was, I think,

Well, I think there should be no different test,

that injunctions should be looked at more closely for some

reason.

Ginsburg was that an injunction, unlike a statute, can be

easily amended.

with some kind of special circumstance the courts are free

MR. D'ALEMBERTE:

9

Yes, sir, Your Honor, and I

10

see an important difference, and the difference, I think,

favors the injunction, and the difference is that now you

do not say to all the world you may not enter this zone.

13

You say it only to the people who have said, in open

these petitioners, and indeed, of all the defendants in

Well, Your Honor, on the

record -- and it's not in the Joint Appendix.

For some

reason it got left out --at pages 64 and 65, the

stipulation was that Ed Martin, Judy Madsen, and Shirley

11

Hobbs well understand that peacefully blocking access to

facilities might constitute a trespass.

13

They feel a violation of such a criminal statute

14

is justified by their belief that protection of the unborn

may merit breaking the criminal trespass laws.

made in one of the many amici briefs in this case.

was the one on behalf of the CIO -- AFL-CIO, and it was

20

that a statute of general application has little danger of

censoring one set of ideas or speakers but not others,

where an injunction by its very nature homes in on a

particular group of speakers, so there can be a suspicion.

3

that the 1992 injunction was inadequate to protect the

4

interests of persons associated with the clinic, and that

5

was not -- that was an injunction that was not challenged.

6

I think the record also shows some reluctance on

7

the part of the judge to modify that injunction, but once

8

he did, it was because he had heard 3 days of evidence in

9

that regard.
The constitutional limits with respect to

10
11

injunctions, we would submit, are those imposed by this

12

Court with respect to reasonable time, place, and manner.

Do you have a case in which a

14

challenged injunction was judged by the time, place, and

You were

But I think to pick up on something that my

10

colleague said, we're talking about not just a medical

11

facility, we're talking about conditions where

12

interference with the ability of women to get to the

13

clinic and get the services that the clinic provides would

14

cause them irreparable harm.

15

This is not a provision that would apply across

16

the board to medical facilities, although I think it is

17

true that medical facilities are not factories, mines, or

18

assembly plants, as one of the members of the court said,

19

but no, I think a court looking at the situation has the

20

power to enjoin certain behavior that poses a threat to

21

people in violation of rights that are protected under

22

State or Federal law, and that's what the judge did in

this case.

criminal statute?
GENERAL DAYS:

3

I wouldn't -- Justice Kennedy, I

4

wouldn't call them special dangers.

5

simply that the mode of analysis, the evidence that the

6

court would look at with respect to the constitutionality

7

of a statute that imposed time, place, or manner

8

restrictions would be different from the type of evidence

9

that the court would look at in dealing with an

injunction.
QUESTION:

The punishment would be different,

too, wouldn't it?

14

Punishment for contempt can be a good

GENERAL DAYS:

That is true, but I think it's

also the case that an injunction has more flexibility.

concern, but I think that unless the Court is going to

2

prohibit courts from issuing injunctions under

3

circumstances like these, there has to be some ability of

4

the courts to address problems like those presented in

5

this particular case.
QUESTION:

6

Yes, there has to be an ability, but

7

doesn't that ability to have to be accompanied by a

8

special solicitude for free speech rights because certain

9

persons are being singled out, which is not the case of a

10

statute, and I don't see anything in your argument where

11

you've acknowledged that.
GENERAL DAYS:

12

Well, first of all, Justice

13

Kennedy, I think it is possible for even statutes to deal

14

with particular problems that may fall more heavily on one

15

group than another, but once again, what the court would

16

do is try to determine whether the legislative body that

17

enacted the statute or ordinance was responding to an

18

actual evil.

19

That would be the analysis.

But it seems to me that applying the Fair

20

Education Association time, place, or manner approach is

21

perfectly suitable and sufficient for situations of this

22

kind.

23

I don't agree with the AFL-CIO that there has to

24

be something you might call a time, place, manner plus

test.

I simply think that, given this type of situation,

QUESTION:

Mr. Days, we're not dealing with an

5

enjoining all kinds of political protesters, students in

the sixties, civil rights marchers?

8

lighter brand of review than one we would apply to a

9

statute?
GENERAL DAYS:

10

We have -- don't we have a long

Doesn't that caution

I'm not suggesting a lighter

11

brand.

12

that's used with respect to statutes ought to be adopted

13

by this Court, but the evidence that is considered is

14

different, but I don't think that is any reason to think

15

that there has to be a heavier test under these

circumstances.

I'm simply suggesting that the same approach

You had a prior injunction, you ignored it.
You just can't be trusted.

12

No

QUESTION:

Or do you think the speech itself is

unlawful?

15

GENERAL DAYS:

No, the speech of course is not

16

unlawful.

17

controlling the conduct, enjoining the conduct will have

18

some impact on speech, but it is in response to the fact

19

that people in the position, in this case close to the

20

clinic, intimidated, harassed, interfered with people who

21

were seeking the services of the clinic, or were providing

22

those services, and that was sufficient in the view of the

23

court to justify the injunction.

I think, given those facts, that

a fear for that person of some type of physical attack.

10

Under those circumstances, I think courts could intervene.
Indeed, under Florida law, there is a stalking

putting them in fear of some other harm to their person.
