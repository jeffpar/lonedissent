CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

Well, we'll hear

Corporation v. AT&T and United States v. AT&T.

6

Now, Mr. Wright.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS
MR. WRIGHT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under section 203(a) of the Communications Act,

11

12

telephone companies are required to file tariffs.

13

issue in this case is whether the Federal Communications

14

Commission has authority to relieve nondominant long

15

distance companies of the requirement that they file

16

tariffs.

17

The

In our view, that question is answered by

18

section 203(b)(2) of the Act, which provides that the

19

Commission may modify any requirement of section 203.

20

Since the Commission may modify any requirement of section

21

203, it may modify the tariff filing requirement

22

established by section 203(a).

23

QUESTION:

24

has to file a tariff?

25

MR. WRIGHT:

Could it go so far as to say nobody

That is the position that the FCC

has taken, and, of course, the D.C. Circuit struck that

down.

question, that the FCC has not gone nearly that far.

5

The - -

Now, we believe that "modify any requirement" would
Let me point out, in response to your

QUESTION:

6

Modify including AT&T or just the

7

nondominant carriers?

Could you do away with the rate

8

filing altogether, or is your position just that you can

9

do away with it with respect to nondominant carriers?
MR. WRIGHT:

10

Well, that's certainly all we're

11

arguing about today.

12

Souter's question as sort of assuming that AT&T would

13

become nondominant at some point in the future.

14

know any rationale for eliminating the tariff filing

15

requirement for a dominant carrier like AT&T.
QUESTION:

16
17

I don't

Why do you draw the distinction,

market power?

18

MR. WRIGHT:

19

QUESTION:

20

Now, I guess I'd interpreted Justice

Yes, that's exactly the -That's a reason, but where do you

find that in the text?
MR. WRIGHT:

21

Well, the Commission has the

22

authority.

Under our broadest reading of the statute, the

23

Commission has the authority to modify any requirement.

24

There would be a question as to whether or not it was

25

reasonable to relieve dominant carriers of the authority.

QUESTION:

And your position would be it would

not be reasonable.
MR. WRIGHT:

I don't -- I -- the Commission

4

hasn't taken any view on that.

5

QUESTION:

6

7

You think it would be reasonable for

us to take the position that it would not be reasonable.
MR. WRIGHT:

Well, right now the Commission has

8

not articulated any reason for relieving dominant carriers

9

of such a requirement, but --

10

QUESTION:

No, but I think we just want to know

11

whether we accept your position here -- and if your

12

position here, do we, in effect, and by implication, go

13

the whole hog?

14

MR. WRIGHT:

Our reading of the statute,

"modify

15

any requirement," yes, would allow the Commission, for

16

appropriate reasons, to relieve all carriers of the tariff

17

filing requirement.

18

QUESTION:

Sort of the Act is no longer

19

necessary, it's a fully competitive industry, and we'll

20

simply modify the Act to no longer exist.

21

MR. WRIGHT:

If and when it happens that the

22

industry is fully competitive, then we believe Congress

23

has authorized the Commission to do away with a tool to

24

enforce just and reasonable rates that would no longer

25

have a purpose.

QUESTION:

Well, why is it that -- I think you

2

acknowledged that the only purpose of the - - that the

3

purpose of the Act is not only to assure reasonable rates,

4

but also to prevent price discrimination, and I don't know

5

why it is so self-evident that when there is competition

6

there cannot be effective price discrimination.

7

understand that at all.

MR. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

I don't

Well, I -Have you ever bought a new car?

11

negotiator you're not going to get as good a price as

12

somebody who is.

13

MR. WRIGHT:

A

Well, unreasonably discriminatory,

14

as construed by the Commission, includes -- I'm sorry,

15

competition assumes that there'll be give-and-take of

16

negotiation, and that -- the fact that different rates get

17

determined does not necessarily show that something's

18

unreasonably discriminatory.

19

I'd like to rely on AT&T's submission to the

20

Commission to answer your question, though.

21

said that by definition, nondominant carriers lack

22

sufficient market power to be able to engage in improper

23

price discrimination without suffering the discipline of

24

the marketplace.

MR. WRIGHT:

In this particular instance, Your

Honor.

QUESTION:

5

MR. WRIGHT:

In this particular.
I also wanted to make the point, in

6

response to Justice Souter's question, that so far all the

7

Commission has done is relieve part of one of three

8

markets of the tariff filing requirement.

9

lifted for international calls.

It has not been

It has not been lifted,

10

by and large, for the local exchange carriers, which do 99

11

percent of the interstate access service.

12

lifted for 40 percent of the long distance market not

13

served by AT&T, and with respect to that 40 percent,

14

nondominant carriers like MCI frequently choose to file

15

tariffs, especially with respect to residential customer

16

services.

17

QUESTION:

It's only been

So another way to put it is that it's

18

been eliminated for all of the interstate market except

19

AT&T.

MR. WRIGHT:

For -- and for carriers who choose

to -- choose to file tariffs, and -QUESTION:

The requirement's eliminated for

everybody in that whole market except AT&T.

MR. WRIGHT:

nondominant carriers.

Yes.

1

AT&T reads the statute differently.

It says

2

that it doesn't apply to any requirement.

3

it doesn't apply to the tariff filing requirement, because

4

that's a core requirement of the Act.

5

statute only allows the FCC to modify formalities.

6

We have two responses.

Specifically,

In AT&T's view, the

First, that's not what

7

the statute says.

The statute doesn't say anything about

8

core requirements or formalities.

9

at all clear that such a rule would be needed for

And, in fact, it's not

10

formalities.

11

formalities, and what it does say is the following:

12

"Tariffs shall contain such other information and be

13

printed in such form and be posted and kept open for

14

public inspection in such places as the Commission may by

15

regulation require."

16

Section 203(a) says very little about

So there's another provision that gives the --

17

another provision in section 203 that gives the Commission

18

authority over -- over those formalities.

19

QUESTION:

There was a time when the Commission

20

took a different view of 203, was there not, that 203

21

required rates to be filed?

22

MR. WRIGHT:

There's a 1980 order of the

23

Commission that in the text says something that sounds

24

like that, and in the accompanying footnote says, but, of

25

course, section 203 is very broad.

And the issue in that

Both of those contradictory statements were

Since 1980, the Commission has been

Well, was the 1980 case a case where

7

the Commission had been requested to modify the

requirement?
MR. WRIGHT:

10

No, Your Honor.

No, it was a

different matter.
QUESTION:

11

To give "modify" a very broad

12

reading -- and you are explicit about that, you say it

13

means more than the word "exempt," is that your position?

14
15

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, yes, we define it in light of

Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary.

16

QUESTION:

But, yet, in legal litany modify is

17

usually a kind of an inbetween word, like courts have

18

authority to affirm, modify, or reverse a lower court

19

decision.

And I would concede even that one

of "modify"'s meanings would even be more limited than

are bad dictionaries, just like there are bad regulations.

2

There are a whole bunch of English words that come from

3

the same Latin root, all of which have a connotation of

4

limitation.

5

all comes from the same root, and they all --a root which

6

means measure, and they all contain that limitation of

7

measured, limited, and it seems to me that "modify" bears

8

that same connotation as all of them.

one edition of Webster's might have said about it.

This Court's favorite dictionary is Webster's Third New

15

World Dictionary.

that's what "modify" means, to make a basic change?

the time this Act was passed perhaps that definition

wasn't there?

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, AT&T has not actually said

this.

5

meaning since 1934, but actually the definitions that they

6

cite from the thirties all say "alter."

7

if you want -- if this means "alter" any provision, we

8

think that the FCC has authority to alter any provision.

It suggested that perhaps "modify" has changed in

MR. WRIGHT:

There's a feeling of

Well, on a practical level, it's

seeing what a law review would do to something I wrote, I

realized that it means rewrite.

very similar to the Amtrak case, the case decided 2 years

2

ago, National Passenger Railroad v. Boston & Maine.

3

issue in that case was what the word "required" meant.

4

The D.C. Circuit had said that it had to mean necessary,

5

that "required" meant necessary, that's the first

definition.

7

interpret it just to mean useful in this context; we're

8

going to give it what was effectively a broader meaning.

The

The ICC had said, no, we're going to

This Court said that few phrases in a complex

9
10

scheme of regulation are so clear as to be beyond the need

11

for interpretation when implied in a real context, and

12

went on to say that the existence of alternative

13

dictionary definitions of the word "required," each making

14

some sense under the statute, itself indicates that the

15

statute is open to interpretation.

16

put "modify" in place of "required" and reach the exact

same conclusion.

In this case, you can

That's one of -- it says "in its

discretion and for good cause shown, modify any

And you say the "special

The special circumstance is, what, 1993?

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, we think looking at the

situation today from what Congress saw in 1934, that --

QUESTION:

MR. WRIGHT:

Today is a special circumstance.
The fact that AT&T no longer holds

2

No - - well, that's another --we

3

would think that the Commission has authority to define

what "special circumstances" are too, and could decide

5

that the interest -- that especially viewed from the lens

6

of 1934, that -- when there was really no competition at

7

all, that today's telecommunications world is very

8

different.

QUESTION:

So "special circumstances" can

include everything; the entire realm of communications can

rules, that that's what Congress has authorized it to do.
And, in fact, I don't think I quite made the

11
12

point that how little AT&T's view allows the Commission to

13

do under "modify any requirement."

14

is that we may modify formalities, and we already have

15

authority to modify most of the formalities.

16

Congress expressly delegated that to the Commission as

AT&T reads this to modify some requirements.

don't think we're driven to take either view in

detariff it if that becomes appropriate, but I don't

2

really think that they've made that argument.

3

QUESTION:

Have we held, Mr. Wright, that

4

Chevron deference is equally applicable to an independent

5

commission as is to an agency of the Government?
MR. WRIGHT:

6

I believe so.

Certainly the Amtrak

7

case that I just cited was an ICC case, and, if anything,

8

it would seem that more deference would be appropriate,

10
11

The question is whether

It seems to us it is as much a modification

The Commission has done no more than that here.
Additionally, we think that section 203(c), in

12

fact in particular the first sentence of 203(c), makes

13

clear that the Commission has the power to remove the

14

tariff obligation entirely, because it says that service

15

must be provided under tariff unless otherwise provided by

16

or under the authority of the Act.

17

203(b)(2), in our view, which is the very preceding

it's our view now that this statute is capable of the

under Chevron is all that ought to be required to trigger

deference.

We've thought that position

In any event,

We now think

I just wanted to establish that the

10

"clearly" -- you didn't really mean the "clearly," because

11

you were arguing just what we have been discussing 10

You're still left with the problem

of, you know, how far "modify" takes you and what are

"special circumstances."

8

9

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

But it seems to us that the logic must be that if the

10

Commission has the authority to remove it in some

11

circumstances, therefore the necessary implication is that

12

it's not in those circumstances indispensable to the

13

functioning of title II if the logic that would allow the

14

Commission to take that step exists with respect to 10

15

carriers and also exists with respect to a hundred or four

16

hundred carriers, that there's no natural stopping place.

17

That if the logic works for that -- for the

18

small number of carriers and the logic works equally well

2

MR. VERRILLI:

That's correct, thank you.

3

What I take to be AT&T's central argument is

4

that title II of the Act cannot be enforced absent tariff

5

filings.

6

tariff filing is one method of enforcing an

7

antidiscrimination provision, it is clearly not the only

8

method.

We think that that is simply wrong.

Although

9

The Commission has made a decision here, in its

10

discretion, that it wants to use the complaint process as

11

the statutory --as the principal enforcement method.

12

That is a decision that is owed substantial deference.

13

It's a reasonable policy decision, particularly given

14

AT&T's concession that nondominant carriers can't charge

15

unreasonable or discriminatory rates.

16

Indeed, many non -- many price discrimination

17

statutes, the antitrust laws, the Robinson-Patman Act,

18

State unfair competition laws, are routinely enforced

19

without any requirement of published rates.

that allows those statutes to function is a logic on which

the Commission ought to be entitled to rely here.

competition does not eliminate price discrimination.

2

Indeed, the price discrimination is a tool that's often

3

used most often in fiercely competitive industries.

4

MR. VERRILLI:

But they do operate on the

5

assumption, Justice Scalia, that the very existence of

6

competitors is likely to ferret out the price

7

discrimination, and that competitors have an incentive to

8

find out what the other competitors are charging, and that

9

customers have an incentive to disclose the best offers

10

they're getting from one competitor in order that another

11

competitor can come in and meet or beat that price.

12

therefore it's a matter of disclosure of the rates being

13

offered that counts here, that makes the enforcement

14

mechanism work, and that's the kind of logic the

15

Commission relied on here.

16

plainly a reasonable decision.

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes.

Well, I got in trouble

when I referred to the first one, which is where the rates

9

issue in the past is what constitutes a rate schedule.

And the other one, which is - - has been a big

10

Obviously, in the ordinary meaning a rate schedule or a

11

tariff is a price list, and it's something that you can

12

place an order under.

13

go to the carrier and you place an order under the tariff.

14

You see the list of prices and you

Well, the ICC has interpreted the statute to

15

allow the filing of ordinary contracts, contracts between

16

customers and carriers, which aren't, you know, price

17

lists that you can place an order under; they only apply

18

between the parties.

19

that's -- that that's a permissible modification because

20

it doesn't undercut the other purposes of the statute,

21

because the rates are filed so similarly situated

22

customers can request them.

23

QUESTION:

And the courts have held that

MR. CARPENTER:

6

I suppose

I fear I may be, to some extent,

7

misleading you.

Our position is they can modify the

8

requirements -- the filing requirements of the statute,

9

and that in deciding what that means you have to look at

10

the other provisions of the statute for -- to which the

11

filing requirements are centrally important.

12

thing, as you said in Maislin, is that the rates charged

13

each customer be stated in or ascertainable from the

14

public filing.

And the key

So if that purpose is being served, I think they

can do lots of things to these other requirements, so long

as that purpose is served.

you, where they allowed things that aren't traditional

the requirements of the statute that does modify the

requirements of 203 but's consistent with the statute as a

to serve.

2

but the one thing that can't be done, which is that there

3

can't be any modification of the requirement that the

rates and the terms and conditions affecting the rates be

5

filed so that similarly situated customers are in a

position where they can know what they are and demand

them.

8

Which is what -- what this Court's held really

9

for a century, going back -- you know, all the decisions

10

you cited in Maislin stand for the proposition that this

11

rate-filing requirement that the rates be filed somehow,

12

someplace, somewhere, is utterly central to the statute as

a whole.

QUESTION:

Suppose a Federal Agency gets into

the telecommunications business and its rates are

MR. CARPENTER:

what I'm categorical about is that carriers cannot be

excused from the obligation that they file their rates.

MR. CARPENTER:

1

Yeah.

Well, this is Mr.

2

Verrilli's argument, that the language of section 203 --

and the FCC's, that the language of section 203 shows that

4

you have to read section 203 (b) to authorize the kind of

5

exemptions that we say are prohibited.

6

wrong.

7

charge only filed rates, except as provided -- unless

otherwise provided by or under the authority of this

9

chapter.

10

But that's just

I mean, section 203(c) says that carriers have to

It says chapter, not section.

If it were

referring to 203(b), it would say section.
And it's argued in the reply that there's no

11
12

other provision in the statute that authorizes exceptions

13

to the requirement - - that - - in which the FCC is

14

authorized to create exceptions to the requirement that

15

carriers charge only filed rates, but that's just untrue

too.

17

examples, and in each of them the FCC is delegated

18

authority to enter orders or take other actions that will

19

have the affect of excusing carriers from the obligation

that they file -- they charge only filed rates.

So under this procedure, you file a contract

2

with the FCC, if it approves then you're authorized -- the

3

carriers are authorized to swap services with one other

4

and not charge each other filed rates.
That's true of each -- every other example we

5
6

list.

In each of those other provisions, 205, 210, and

7

the newly enacted 332, the FCC is authorized to take

8

specific action that will have the effect of relieving

9

carriers from the requirement that they charge only filed

10

rates.

11

exemptions just shows that the modification authority

12

isn't as broad.

13

And the fact that Congress enacts these specific

And if you want contemporaneous evidence that

14

Congress didn't understand the modification authority to

15

include the authority to exempt people from the

16

rate-filing requirements whatsoever, at the same time

17

Congress enacted the Communications Act, or the year --

18

the next year it enacted the Motor Carrier Act, and it has

19

the same filing requirements, same modification provisions

20

applicable both to motor common carriers, that's section

21

217 of the Act, and motor contract carriers, that's 218.

22

And in the contract carrier provision, it has

23

the rate-filing requirement, then it has the modification

24

provision, then after that there's a provision that says:

25

"The ICC is authorized to grant relief from the

That clearly shows that

2

Congress didn't understand the modification authority

3

reaches as broad as they say, because it enacted a

4

specific additional provision authorizing them to grant

5

6

So whatever the scope of modification --

that, when did Congress enact that statute?

2

MR. CARPENTER:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CARPENTER:

1935.

Oh, that's in the original, okay.
Yes.

No, that's the original

5

Motor Carrier Act, and that was obviously carried through.

6

In fact, in Maislin among your reasons for declining to

7

allow the FCC to create an exception to the rate-filing

8

requirements under the unreasonable practices ban is the

9

fact that Congress had adopted explicit exemptions for

10

motor contract carriers.

11

the regular common carrier decision that was relied on in

12

Maislin, and I believe judge -- then Judge Scalia wrote in

13

a former life.

14

QUESTION:

And that was also at issue in

Mr. Carpenter, what do you respond to

15

the argument that the existence of competition is a

16

special circumstance?

17

MR. CARPENTER:

There's no doubt that the

18

existence of competition is an extremely significant fact

19

in this regulatory scheme.

20

get deregulation for ourself, it justifies modifications

21

of the rate-filing requirements, it justifies elimination

22

of cost-support requirements with the

23

24

cost-of-service regulation, shortening the notice period

25

to as little as 1 day.

As we have said, in trying to

1

So it's a very significant fact, but the statute

2

says you can modify in particular circumstances, not

3

exempt, and all -- all competition allows within -- under

4

203 is the sorts of streamlined regulation that we are

5

seeking in this petition that we filed that people keep

6

misquoting.

7

doesn't eliminate the need for the rate-filing

8

requirements for the reasons that I said earlier, because

9

you'll have price differences even in competitive markets.

So competition is very significant, but it

10

11

They're not anticompetitive, but they are price

12

differences that Congress sought to eliminate.

13

wanted equal rates for similarly situated customers, and

14

decided the way to achieve that is making everyone file

15

rates so that all customers would know what they were and

16

could demand them.

17

QUESTION:

Congress

Does the FCC have a developed body of

18

law to define what is a dominant participant in an

19

industry, or is this a category --a juridical category

20

that is new for this regulation only?

21

MR. CARPENTER:

The FCC has had this

22

classification for a number of years, I believe it dated

23

from the early 1980's, and they define dominant carriers

as carriers possessing market power, and it has

significance for tarrifying requirements and for other

provisions, because dominant carriers are subject to some

2

FCC regulations, I believe, that others --

3

QUESTION:

Is there support in the statute for

4

that category in these areas where the FCC has been

5

applying it?

6

MR. CARPENTER:

We, I don't believe, have ever

7

argued that the FCC doesn't have the authority to make

8

that distinction for some purposes.

9

I -- our point here is only that whatever the significant

Our point here -- and

10

of that distinction for other purposes, you can't be -- it

11

can't be a basis to exempt carriers from what the statute

12

unambiguously requires that all do, which is to charge

13

only filed rates.

14

As I've said, that we think this case, even if

15

you were to disagree with us that the statute is

16

susceptible to the FCC's interpretation, we think this

17

case is controlled by the decision in Maislin.

18

establishes, as, you know, many prior cases had, that

19

rate-filing requirements are so central to the statutory

20

scheme that even broad and facially applicable provisions

21

of the law, like the ban on unreasonable practices at

22

issue there, can't be construed to authorize exceptions to

23

the great filing requirement unless Congress has

24

explicitly so provided.

belief, that Mr. Verrilli tried to distinguish Maislin by-

2

saying that it didn't involve the requirement that rates

3

be filed, but only a requirement -- which is a requirement

4

of section 203(a) of the statute -- that involved only a

5

requirement that carriers follow whatever tariffs they've

6

filed and that they not charge rates that are different

7

from those that are set forth in the tariff.

8

there's a fundamental distinction in the statute between

9

the two.

10

And they say

Now, even if that were true it wouldn't do these

11

petitioners any good, because they're doing exactly what

12

they say what Maislin said they couldn't do, they're

13

charging lower rates than those set forth in the tariff.

14

That's what MCI did in the underlying litigation that led

15

to this; it was negotiating discounts of 5 to 10 percent

16

below its generally applicable tariff rates.

17

And the FCC and MCI each explain in their brief

18

that the consequence of their position is that carriers

19

can go off and cut secret deals, rebates, all the things

20

that 203(c) of the statute prohibit.

21

were the distinction that they're positing, it wouldn't do

22

them any good here because this order allows exactly what

Maislin prohibits.

They're just

If you charge a customer a rate that's lower

The two obligations

At page 126 of the opinion, 497 U.S. at 126, the

Now, that's a

subsequent followup to Permian Basin that did, and that's

there the Court applied pre-1935 decisions under the

But Maislin rejected that, because

And in this situation, the Interstate Commerce

10

Act precedents absolutely should apply because the statute

11

was -- the provisions we're dealing with here, sections

12

14

here, it wasn't until 1992 that the FCC even said that

carriers from the rate-filing requirement.

interpretations of the statute that were in existence in

have anything to do with whether rates were filed or not.

3

The problem was that a new sort of cottage industry had

arose which involved both entities that weren't common

5

carriers and weren't subject to the filing requirement and

6

entities like AT&T -- in theory like AT&T and MCI, that

were.

The problem the statute addressed -- it didn't

And what Congress did in that statute was it
made everybody who provided operator services - - including

10

those who weren't carriers and weren't subject to the

11

statute, made everybody file information.

12

information required by 203, rates, and some of it was

other information that wasn't required by 203 --

QUESTION:

Some of it was

And you'd say the carriers would have

15

had to -- in addition to that, although it overlapped,

16

would have to comply in it -- with 203 generally?

17

MR. CARPENTER:

Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

It

imposed additional obligations.

20

required by 203,

obligations on noncarriers who weren't subject to any

requirement at all.

MR. CARPENTER:

Noncarriers.

1

The problem was the FCC wasn't doing anything at all to

2

combat something that had become a massive problem, which

3

was the sort of new fly-by-night companies cutting deals

4

with hotels and ending up charging people rates that were

5

two or three times those that AT&T and MCI charged.

6

that's what that statute addressed, and the statute

7

explicitly said that nothing in it could be construed as

8

altering the obligations of any provision in the statute.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER J. WRIGHT

16

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS

17

MR. WRIGHT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

18

In response to AT&T's comments about Maislin and

19

the filed rate doctrine, it is true, as has been pointed

20

out, that that's a different issue arising under a

21

different statute.

22

instructive to consider what -- how -- what would happen

23

if the Communications Act said that the FCC may modify any

24

requirement, including the tariff-filing requirement.

25

the statute said that, I think there'd be no doubt --we

I'd also like to suggest that it's

If

1

wouldn't be here today, it would be clear that we could

2

modify the tariff- filing requirement if the statute said

3

modify any requirement, including the tariff- filing

4

requirement.

5

Now, in this hypothetical statute, in that

6

circumstance what had been said in a different context

7

arising under a different statute wouldn't matter.

8

fact, that phrase including the tariff- filing requirement

9

would be redundant.

In

The statute says "modify any

10

requirement," and it would be a peculiar rule of statutory

11

construction that required Congress to be redundant.

12

Now, one thing that's clearly come out --

13

QUESTION:

I don't think your opponent would

14

agree that that's -- I don't think your opponent would

15

agree that that statute would be - - you would be right

16

under that statute, because he says this is not a

17

modification requirement, including the filing

18

requirement.

19

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, I was going to say one thing

20

that's come out is that AT&T clearly thinks that under no

21

circumstances at all can the FCC lift the tariff- filing

22

requirement.

23

QUESTION:

No.

Well, they would allow it to be

24

filed by somebody else, so long as it's out there

25

somewhere, and that's eliminating the tariff filing.

MR. WRIGHT:

Well, the first requirement is that

2

they shall be filed, and AT&T says that we - - that the FCC

3

doesn't have that authority.

4

that it therefore reads 203(b)(2)

5

requirements, not any requirement, and that is what the

6

statute says.

7

One final point,

We think that it's clear
to say modify some

if I may.

You know, the --

8

it's been suggested that Congress would -- couldn't

imagine a detariffed world.

Well, just last summer with

10

respect to commercial mobile carriers like cellular

11

carriers in section 332(c), Congress authorized -- what

12

Congress did was say that these cellular companies are

13

generally subject to the title II requirements we've been

14

discussing today, but it said that the Commission may

15

waive any requirement,

envisions that unreasonable discrimination may be

prohibited without tariffs.
