ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HUNGAR:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Respondent was convicted of a felony that

11
12

carries a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison.

13

the Sentencing Guidelines, the presumptive imprisonment

14

range was zero to 6 months.

15

to prison, the district court imposed a sentence of 60

16

months probation.

17

Under

Instead of sending respondent

Shortly after he began serving that sentence,

18

respondent tested positive for cocaine, and the district

19

court revoked his probation and sentenced him to 20 months

20

in prison.

21

U.S.C. section 3565(a), which provides that when a

22

defendant possesses illegal drugs while on probation, the

23

court shall revoke the sentence of probation and sentence

24

the defendant to not less than one-third of the original

25

sentence.

The court imposed that sentence under 18

1

The court of appeals reversed, holding that the

2

phrase "original sentence" refers to the presumptive range

3

of imprisonment that could have been imposed under the

4

guidelines rather than the sentence of probation that was

5

actually imposed.

6

erred in reaching that conclusion.

7

We submit that the court of appeals

Our argument has two parts.

First, the

8

interpretation adopted by the court of appeals and urged

9

by respondent is flatly inconsistent with the plain

10

language of the statute and must be rejected.

11

once respondent's interpretation has been rejected, there

12

are only two suggested ways to read the statute, and of

13

those, only our interpretation is consistent with the

14

statutory structure, context, and purpose.

15

Second,

Turning to the first point, our principal

16

disagreement with respondent concerns the plain meaning of

17

the phrase,

18

either the dictionary definition, or the ordinary, common

19

sense understanding of that phrase, it has only one

20

possible meaning in the context of Federal sentencing law.

21

It means the initial judgment of the court specifying the

22

punishment to be imposed on a convicted criminal.

23

"original sentence."

QUESTION:

In our view, under

If that's the case, then you're

24

arguing for a sentence of probation all over again, only

25

one-third of -- with a one-third minimum of the original.

1

I mean, if plain meaning is good, you've got to take plain

2

meaning all the way.

3

MR. HUNGAR:

With respect, Justice Souter, we

4

don't agree with that.

5

take plain meaning all the way, but the fact that

6

"original sentence" means the sentence of probation that

7

was imposed in this case does not mean that the defendant

8

here had to be sentenced to a new sentence of probation,

9

and there are two reasons why that is so.

10

We certainly agree that we have to

We agree that the phrase,

"one-third of the

11

original sentence," if considered in isolation, has two

12

possible meanings.

13

original sentence, in this case 20 months, or to the

14

length and the type of the original sentence, in this case

15

20 months of probation, and if that were the only thing we

16

had to go on, the answer you suggest would be the only one

17

possible under the Rule of Lenity, but we have other

18

guides to congressional intent here.

19

important, is the context in which that provision, one-

20

third of the original sentence, rests.

21

It could refer to the length of the

intention, then obviously we wouldn't be here, but we

6

don't believe the statute is so poorly drafted that we

can't discern, by applying normal rules of statutory

8

construction, the meaning that Congress in fact intended.

9

If Congress had more clearly expressed its

QUESTION:

Mr. Hungar, following up on Justice

10

Souter's question, I suppose at the time the statute was

11

enacted there might well have been people still

12

incarcerated who were sentenced to a term of imprisonment

13

followed by a term of probation, and supposing someone was

14

in jail on a 15-year sentence, 10 years jail imprisonment

15

plus 5 years probation, and that had not expired at the

16

time the statute was enacted, and that person had his

17

probation revoked in the third year of the probation

18

period, what would the appropriate sentence be there?

19

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, as I understand the

20

preexisting sentencing scheme, Your Honor, that would not

21

be a possible sentence, because the way probation formerly

22

worked was that it was an alternative to imprisonment.

23

judge would either impose a sentence of imprisonment, and

24

then suspend the execution - -

MR. HUNGAR:

I don't know whether it was always

true, but certainly prior to the

984 Sentencing Reform

Act the law was that probation was an alternative to

5

imprisonment.

6

and then suspend the execution of that sentence, or would

If the minimum

1

required by our reading of the statute is within the

2

guidelines range, then the guidelines maximum would be the

3

maximum, because -- because this provision of section

4

3565 (a) only trumps the other provisions of section 3565

5

to the extent they're inconsistent.

6

not inconsistent, they continue to govern, so if the

7

minimum is within the guidelines range or below the

8

guidelines range, the top of the guidelines range would

still be the maximum, because --

which is -- so the guidelines range is not the maximum.

To the extent they're

-- wouldn't the full sentence be 5

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, the maximum sentence is 5

19

years if the court wishes to depart from the -- and has

20

grounds for an upward departure from the guidelines range,

21

but normally the maximum sentence that is available under

22

subchapter (a), which is the language of 3565(a)(2).

23

see, our position is that --

QUESTION:

How can 20 months be one-third and 60

months not be the full original sentence?

We're talking

1

about what this defendant's exposure is --

2

MR. HUNGAR:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HUNGAR:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- under your reading of the statute.
Yes, Your Honor, but the last

5

provision of section 3565(a), the provision we're

6

discussing here, only imposes a mandatory minimum.

7

doesn't change what otherwise would be the maximum

8

sentence.

Q

It

So to the extent that -- for instance, if the

10

guidelines range here were 15 to 25 months, and the

11

mandatory minimum under this statute were 20 months, the

12

defendant could be sentenced to - - obviously would have to

13

be sentenced to 20 months.

14

The court could sentence him up to 25 months

15

because -- because the provisions of 3565(a) (2), which

16

normally govern revocation and which provide that the

17

court can impose any sentence that would otherwise have

18

been available under subchapter (a), that provision would

19

permit the court to go up to 25 months, because a 25-

20

month sentence would also have been available under

21

subchapter (a) at the time of the initial sentencing, so

22

the mandatory minimum 20 months trumps anything in section

23

3565 to the extent it's inconsistent, but to the extent

24

there's something in 3565 that would permit a higher

25

sentence, that continues to have effect.

QUESTION:

1

I don't understand why it trumps

2

anything inconsistent, because subsection (2), which is

3

the "any other sentence that was available" provision, is

4

trumped by the proviso after it which says,

5

"notwithstanding any other provision."
MR. HUNGAR:

6

Yes,

but the "notwithstanding"

7

proviso only requires a mandatory minimum.

It doesn't say

8

the rest of sentencing law is totally inapplicable here.

9

All it says is, notwithstanding any other provision of

10

this section, this mandatory minimum sentence must be

11

imposed.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. HUNGAR:

Not less than one-third.
That's correct, so to the extent

14

other provisions of section 3565 are not inconsistent with

15

the mandatory minimum, they continue to govern.

16

Now, if the mandatory minimum, as in this case,

17

is higher than the guidelines range, is higher than any

18

other sentence available under subchapter (a), then our

19

position is that the mandatory minimum is also the

20

maximum, because the guidelines provide that when a

21

mandatory minimum sentence exceeds the normal guidelines

22

range, then that mandatory minimum sentence shall be the

23

guideline sentence, and you can't go higher than that.

24
25

Further on the point of why the word "revoke"
demonstrates that a sentence of imprisonment rather than a

that, at least for a time, the defendant has lost the

opportunity to enjoy the privilege of conditional release.

It means

Section 3565(a)(2) demonstrates that in the

6

7

context of probation, under the current sentencing scheme,

8

it makes clear that once a court has revoked a defendant's

9

probation, probation is no longer an option, and some

10

other sentence must be imposed, so by using the word

11

"revoke" in section 3565(a), the provision at issue here,

QUESTION:

12

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, the dichotomy in section --- which has another 3 0 days to run.
The dichotomy in section 3565(a)(1)

13

and (a)(2) demonstrates this point, and this applies not

14

merely to probation under this statute, but the same is

15

true under previous statutes, the same is true for

16

supervised release and parole.

17

a rule the defendant goes to jail, and at the very least,

18

conditional liberty is no longer possible, and in section

19

3565(a)(1), the court has an option of continuing the

20

defendant on probation, the same probation and extending

21

the term if the court wishes.

QUESTION:

When revocation occurs, as

new sentence of probation with much more onerous

2

et cetera, et cetera, that that is a different sentence of

3

probation, and it's still a sentence that's available to

4

the judge under the law.
MR. HUNGAR:

5

No, Justice Kennedy, because that

6

would not be revocation, that would be continuance.

7

That's the dichotomy in section 3565.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

seems to me.

Well, but that's the argument, it

You can argue it's the imposition of a new

sentence of probation with new conditions.
MR. HUNGAR:

11

But our point is that Congress uses

12

these words in a certain way in the Federal sentencing

13

scheme.

14

word "revoke" to mean, you're no longer going to enjoy

15

conditional release. It uses the word, continue, or

16

extend, to achieve the result you desire, and that's shown

17

because in 3565 (a) (1), the first option a court normally

18

has when a defendant violates probation is to continue the

19

defendant on probation with or without extending the term

20

or modifying or enhancing the conditions of probation, so

21

if that were what Congress had meant -- if Congress had

22

meant, the court should have the option of continuing

23

defendant on probation and modifying the terms and

24

conditions, then that's what it would have said, because

25

that's what it said in 3565(a) (1), but instead, Congress

Mr. Hungar, may I ask you, under the

mechanics of saying the defendant is sentenced to X amount

11

of time in prison, and then saying, but I suspend that

term of imprisonment and place you on probation?
MR. HUNGAR:

Not necessarily, Your Honor.

Under

the previous version of the statute, 18 U.S.C. 3651, in

15

the 1982 version of title 18, and also I think under

previous versions of the probationary sentencing scheme,

17

the court had the option.
It could either impose a sentence and then

18
19

suspend the execution of the sentence, which is the option

20

you identified, or it could suspend sentencing -- suspend

21

the imposition of the sentence, so there would be no

These are problems

Our recommendation, and the one from the court

of appeals below, has no such problems.

The Government --

5

and all the courts of appeals that have adopted it

indicates no problems, and if you turn to the legislative

7

history, you see why.

8

if the Congress, excuse me, had intended this fundamental

change, don't you think there would be something in the

If the Government had intended --

legislative history -- something, if they wanted to start

using probation terms as the barometer?

14

There's nothing.

In the Dewsnup case, you would think, based on
that, that that would be required.
QUESTION:

More importantly --

Dewsnup dealt with the principle

15

we've enacted in connection with the Bankruptcy Code in

16

1978, that absent some showing to the contrary either in

17

the legislative history or the statutory language, we

18

would presume that the old Bankruptcy Act, the principles

19

carried over, but we've never had -- enunciated any such

20

general principle in connection with the entire body of

21

criminal law.

22

MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor, not specifically,

23

but I think frankly it ought to be more easily applied in

a criminal context because the Rule of Lenity applies in a

think that if Congress did have in mind the old system,

understanding that if you violated the terms of your

imposed would be given you, but in fact the whole term.

Would it be normal to revoke probation, which

sentence -- the full term of it, not one-third of it --

3

would come down upon you.
MR. SMITH:

4

No, Your Honor, the court could

5

suspend imposition of the sentence, for example, and there

6

would be no sentence to put in its place, so I think the

7

court still retained discretion, but there was something

8

over their head, just like there's a guideline range over
a defendant's head now.
QUESTION:

10

Yes, but this statute would have made

a change in that prior to this statute, if the person on

was, the judge might not have revoked this probation at

if you're dealing with the

it.
In other words, they wouldn't always suspend the

3

imposition of a sentence, and it seems to me your answer

4

to Justice Scalia doesn't fit so well in the latter

5

situation, where there are sentences imposed but its

6

service is suspended.

7

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Even in that

8

context, though, looking at this case, the judge under the

9

guidelines wouldn't have given more than 6 months.

10
11

It's

as if he imposed a sentence of 6 months and suspended it.
The guidelines suggest that a sentence of more

12

than 6 months wasn't warranted, and the Government's

13

agreement in the plea agreement suggests that a sentence

14

beyond 6 months wasn't warranted, so looking even at the

imposition -- excuse me, execution suspended, it's

still -- the sentence that would have been imposed would

not have been more than 6 months.

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

MR. SMITH:

Okay.
If you look at the legislative

a minor technical change, the kind you would not expect

there to be a lot of legislative history on, and so it's

not surprising that there's not here.

If a person is a misdemeanant, and gets 5 years

who simply possesses drugs -- not that that's not a

13

14

8 months more than somebody who commits murder in that

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. HUNGAR:

I have a few brief points I'd like

8

to make.

First, in response to Justice Stevens' question

9

about whether there would be a class of defendants who had

10

been sentenced under the previous scheme, the answer to

11

that question is no.

12

of this provision was to those defendants whose term of

3
4
5

probation began in
988.

This statute -- the effective date

989.

That is, after December 3 st,

This statute was enacted in I believe in - - well,

it was adopted by Congress in October of

988.

So because probation begins under the statute

16

7

upon imposition of the sentence, anyone who received a

8

sentence of probation that would be covered by this

9

statute would have done so after the statute went into

20
21

effect.
QUESTION:

How would the statute apply,

22

Mr. Hungar, to a person who 4 years earlier had been given

23

a suspended sentence of 6 months, then was suspended and

24

was put on probation for 5 years?

25

a sentence, I understand, as Justice Ginsburg has pointed

Now, that would not be

out, but he's on probation at the time, and then that

2

person's probation was revoked.

3

to that person?

4

MR. HUNGAR:

Would the statute apply

No, because the effective date

5

provision of this particular statute at section 7303(d) of

6

the 1988 act, which added this amendment -- the effective

7

date of this provision, it applies to sentences of

8

probation that begin after December 31st, 1988, so in your

9

hypothetical, it would not be subject to this provision.

10

QUESTION:

So the sentence -- if the person on

11

probation had its probation revoked after the enactment of

12

the statute, that person would not have had any mandatory

13

requirement.

14

QUESTION:

3

MR. HUNGAR:

All right.
In answer to Justice Scalia's

4

question about whether there are any cases in which the

5

Government's interpretation would be more lenient, there

6

are such cases.

7

which we didn't cite in our brief in the District of

8

Columbia, the United States against Harrison, 815 F.Supp.

9

494, and in that case the judge held that the Government's

10

interpretation was more lenient, and therefore, regardless

11

of the ambiguity, the Rule of Lenity required adoption of

12

the Government's interpretation, because there the

13

guidelines range was 97 to 121 months, and the court had

14

departed downward and imposed probation, but then the

15

defendant --

In fact, there was a district court case

QUESTION:

But that's an extraordinary case with

a downward departure.

19

is going to incarcerate the defendant for a considerably

20

longer time.

MR. HUNGAR:

Where the sentence is within the

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

22

Sentencing Commission statistics, the 1991 and 1992 annual

23

report, suggest that- only 5 to 10 percent of probationary

24

sentences are downward departures, but of course, in those

downward departures, in this case, for example, the effect

1

of applying respondent's interpretation would have been to

2

mandate a sentence of over 40 months in prison, which is

3

far more than our interpretation could ever mandate, but

4

it's true that in most cases that would not be the case.

5

QUESTION:

It is true that supervised release

6

terms, in terms of number of months or years, tends to be

7

shorter than sentences of probation, is that not so?
MR. HUNGAR:

8

9

Your Honor.

I don't know whether that's true,

There are limitations that are more strict in

10

some cases than in probation, but it's interesting to note

11

that of the 12 court of appeals cases of which we're aware

12

that apply this provision, Granderson is the only one in

13

which the defendant received 5 years of probation.

14

every other one of those cases the defendant received no

15

more than 3 years of probation, and I'm not aware of

16

statistics indicating whether supervised release or

17

probation on average is longer.

QUESTION:

In

Mr. Hungar, how does the Rule of

19

Lenity work?

20

make believe the Rule -- we decide to apply the Rule of

21

Lenity.

22

this statute, depending upon what kind of a situation

23

first comes before us, or rather, would we interpret the

24

statute leniently to the first defendant and then also

25

leniently to the second defendant, depending upon which

I'm not real sure how it works.

If -- just

Would that give us a constant interpretation of

interpretation works case by case?
MR. HUNGAR:

I think the Rule of Lenity requires

3

a constant interpretation.

4

based solely on the facts of a particular case and then

5

have the statute mean different things, depending on the

6

particular defendant before the court.

QUESTION:

You can't determine lenity

Can you make your basic lenity

determination based upon the standard case, the

nonextraordinary case - -

10

MR. HUNGAR:

11

QUESTION:

12

3

Absolutely, Justice Souter, but --- which would be this one rather

than the D.C. Circuit case?
MR. HUNGAR:

Our -- well, I suppose you would

4

also have to consider the degree of lenity.

5

may be slightly more lenient here and far more harsh

20

That is, it

there, and that would be taken into consideration as well,
but our principal submission is that the Rule of Lenity
does not apply.

It certainly doesn't apply to permit

adoption of respondent's interpretation.
If it applies, then the only way to construe the

21

statute is to require a new, shorter term of probation,

22

which we think is absurd, but can't require respondent's

23

interpretation, because respondent's interpretation is

24

contrary to the plain language of the statute.

just reading the statute.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. HUNGAR:

That's the rule of least absurdity.
That's right -- no, Your Honor, the

4

Rule of Lenity, as this Court said last term in the Smith

5

v. United States case, which we've cited in our brief, the

6

Rule of Lenity doesn't come into play to let you choose

7

between one interpretation that is consistent with the

8

language and another that's not.

9

doesn't permit you to adopt an interpretation that is

10

The Rule of Lenity just

barred by the plain language of the statute.
QUESTION:

11

But once we've applied the rule of

12

least absurdity, then we may be in a position to apply the

13

Rule of Lenity.

14

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, that's my next point, Your

15

Honor.

16

others have suggested that our interpretation is not

17

consistent with the plain language, so we just have to

18

pick and choose between various inconsistent

19

interpretations -- that is, interpretations that aren't

20

consistent with the plain language, but our interpretation

21

is consistent with the plain language.

22

type of the sentence.

Congress - - the term of imprisonment to be imposed depends

2

on, and is based on one-third of the term of supervised

3

release, but we know from the context that Congress didn't

4

mean a new term of supervised release that's one third as

5

long as the old term, even though it used the same

6

structure.

7

clear in section 3583(g).
We think it's equally clear here in context,

8

9

It meant, in prison, and it made that very-

because when Congress said, sentence the defendant,

10

Congress had already said, revoke probation, so we know

11

probation is not an option.

12

sentence the defendant to not less than one-third of the

13

original sentence, Congress had to be saying, sentence the

14

defendant to prison, and the only question is how long,

and that is answered by the phrase, not less than one-

QUESTION:

Therefore, by saying,

Why isn't it just as logical, then,

I don't

1

see why that's not an equally permissible interpretation.
MR. HUNGAR:

2

Because original sentence doesn't

3

mean, sentence that was available but not imposed.

4

Original sentence has only one possible meaning as the

5

words are used in the English language.
QUESTION:

6

But we know it cannot mean original

7

sentence, because here the original sentence was one of

8

probation.

9

MR. HUNGAR:

And that's precisely our point.

10

The original sentence was a sentence of probation.

11

Therefore, original sentence means the sentence of

12

probation that was imposed in this case, but one-third of

13

the original sentence doesn't necessarily mean 20 months

14

of probation.

15

Just as in the supervised release provision,

16

where one-third of the term of release doesn't mean a new

17

sentence of supervised release, here one-third of the

18

original sentence doesn't mean a new sentence of

19

probation, it means --

QUESTION:

Well, but in - - that's mis -- it

2

here.
MR. HUNGAR:

3

Because it was unnecessary, because

4

when Congress says,

5

statute where Congress is now directing the court to

6

sentence the defendant, probation is no longer an option,

7

because Congress has already directed the court to revoke

probation, and the phrase,

"sentence," at the point in the

11

The only something else that there is by the time you get

12

to the part of the statute that mandates a new sentence is

13

imprisonment.

14

Something else has to be imposed instead.

QUESTION:

Can you cite your authority -- you've

You all think this statutory language

commands that, and forbids a different sentence of
