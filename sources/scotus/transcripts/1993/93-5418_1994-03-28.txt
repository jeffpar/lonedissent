CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 93-5418, Orrin S. Reed v. Robert Farley.
Mr. Solovy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROLD S. SOLOVY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. SOLOVY:

Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it

please the Court:
Congress included in the Interstate Detainer Act

11

three legislative imperatives which are very helpful in

12

keeping in mind to resolve this case properly.

13

is that the receiving State, in this case Indiana, when it

14

was the actant in putting the prisoner to trial, had to

15

try the prisoner within 120 days.

16

the trial did not take place within 120 days, the trial

17

court in Indiana was mandated to dismiss the case.

18

the third is that the courts of the United States are

19

directed by Congress to enforce the agreement.

20

The first

The second is that if

And

Now, these provisions -- if I might call the

21

Court's attention to these provisions -- are found at

22

pages 6a of our opening brief.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Solovy, you said Congress put

24

these in the Act, but the Act really didn't apply to any

25

State unless the State voluntarily adopted it, isn't that

right?
MR. SOLOVY:

That's correct.

48 States have

3

voluntarily opted into the Interstate Detainer Act.

4

Congress adopted the Act in 1970.

5

solemnly swear to abide by the agreement.

6

QUESTION:

Each of the States

So Congress' participation in it can

7

easily be called a Federal law, but I don't know how the

8

Interstate Act itself qualifies as a Federal law.

9

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, with all due respect, Justice

10

Scalia, I think the Court treaded this ground in Cuyler

11

and in Carchman, and, indeed, in taking the certiorari in

12

Fex v. Michigan --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SOLOVY:

For this purpose?
For -- well, I don't see what the

15

jurisdiction of the Court would have been to grant

16

certiorari in Fex if this were not a Federal law.

17

QUESTION:

Oh, I think it's one thing to say

18

that we have jurisdiction over interstate agreements and

19

quite another thing to say that for purposes of habeas

20

corpus we would be enforcing a Federal law.

21

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, with all due respect, Justice

22

Scalia, I fail to see the distinction for -- if this Court

23

has jurisdiction for certiorari and jurisdiction to take a

24

case on certiorari, then I cannot see how it doesn't

25

qualify under 2254 as a Federal law to be enforced under

1

habeas corpus.

That's not the Government -- position the

2

Solicitor takes in this case.

3

QUESTION:

Perhaps enforceable, but not

4

necessarily to be enforced.

5

habeas corpus jurisdiction, and perhaps real Federal laws

6

that the States have to observe, whether they like it or

7

not, may be treated differently from voluntary State

8

agreements such as this one.

9

MR. SOLOVY:

We have discretion under

Again, Justice Scalia, with all due

10

respect, this is a real Federal law.

11

of law that says that the Interstate Detainer Act is a

12

stepchild which is not entitled to be accorded habeas

13

corpus relief.

14

discretionary, but Congress here has spoken very loudly,

15

and if this Court does not exercise and adopt Federal

16

rules as the Court did in Fex, then you're going to have

17

havoc.

Of course, the writ is always

18

For example --

19

QUESTION:

20

interstate agreement?

21

MR. SOLOVY:

22

23

I don't see an order

Can a State get out of this

Of course.

A State can opt out

tomorrow.
QUESTION:

Well, I don't see how -- if a State

24

violates its own law, we don't accept habeas corpus

25

because a State can change its law.

So, also, it seems to

1

me, if a State violates the interstate agreement, we

2

shouldn't enforce it by habeas corpus because if a State

3

doesn't like it it can simply pull out of the agreement

4

anyway.

5

MR. SOLOVY:

That would be a very hollow

6

agreement indeed, and such a ruling would cause all of the

7

States to opt out and disappear from this Act.

8

reason, I submit, that you decided Mauro, Cuyler,

The

Carchman, and Fex, is to say here is a national law which
10
11

we're going to adopt uniformly.
For example, Justice Scalia, in Fex you said

12

that -- for the Court, that the 180 days ran when the

13

receiving State received the notice.

14

Federal law, then perhaps Iowa is going to say quite the

15

opposite, it's going to say when the prisoner's accepted,

16

and you're going to have havoc and chaos if you don't have

17

one national rule.

18

Now, if that's not a

So it doesn't -- with all due respect, it

1

doesn't seem we should tarry very long on that position of

20

the State of Indiana.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Solovy, I guess you concede

22

there's no constitutional violation of the speedy trial

23

clause here.

24
25

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, this Court said, Justice

O'Connor, in deciding Carchman, that Congress had in mind

1

in passing this Act, at least in part the prisoner's

2

speedy trial constitutional right.

3

QUESTION:

Now so --

Well, do you take the position that

4

the Constitution was violated, the speedy trial clause, in

5

this case.

6

7

MR. SOLOVY:

I'd say the purpose of the

Constitution --

8

QUESTION:

Why don't you answer the question?

9

MR. SOLOVY:

Yes.

No, I do - - not directly,

10

Justice O'Connor.

11

implication of the Constitution --

12

It was not directly violated.

QUESTION:

But the

Are you treating this, then, as

13

though -- as a counterpart to the Speedy Trial Act.

14

is, there are firm deadlines in the Speedy Trial Act that

15

don't necessarily coincide with what the Constitution

16

would require absent -- just by itself.

17
18
19

MR. SOLOVY:

That

That's a very helpful question to

my position, Justice Ginsburg, because that's -QUESTION:

But, on the other hand, if you are

20

equating it -- to the extent that it's implementing the

21

same purpose that the constitutional provision implements,

22

then if you're dealing with a constitutional violation,

23

then mustn't you show prejudice, and where is any

24

prejudice here?

25

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, I don't -- well, there's a

1

great prejudice to Mr. Reed because Mr. Reed has been in

2

the penitentiary for 11 years and if the Act were enforced

3

he would have been discharged in September of 1983.

4

there's great prejudice --

5

QUESTION:

So

Well, that's not the kind of

6

prejudice a violation of the speedy trial provision of the

7

Constitution would be addressing, is it?

8

11

12

13

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, but this is very much,

Justice Ginsburg, like jurisdiction, that's always
addressed in Federal habeas corpus.
QUESTION:

Why isn't it very much like a statute

of limitations, which is not jurisdictional.
MR. SOLOVY:

It also is very much like a statute

14

of limitations, and Justice Thomas said in his opinion in

15

Doggett that the reasons for statute of limitations,

16

statutes of repose, Speedy Trial Act, is you have a

17

legislative determination that past that point in time the

18

defendant shall not be tried, and --

19

QUESTION:

But a statute of limitations is an

20

affirmative defense that the defendant raises.

21

quote, jurisdictional.

22

MR. SOLOVY:

It isn't,

In this -- in this -- under the

23

Interstate Detainer Act, Justice Ginsburg, the defendant,

24

the prisoner, does not have to assert the defense.

25

the prosecutor, in this case Mr. Brown, signed the request

When

1

for the detainer, he stated that he would bring Mr. Reed

2

to trial within the provisions of section 4(c), and that

3

is the 120-day provision.

4

And this case is rarely going to happen again,

5

because the problem in this case was that Mr. Brown

6

apparently never read section 4(c).

7

Indiana, like all the other States, have Interstate

Detainer Act administrators, he, Mr. Brown, never

understood that there was a 120-day limitation.

And, indeed, Mr. Reed filed three motions in

which he called Mr. Brown's and the court's attention to

12

the Interstate Detainer Act.

court said in open court -- and I quote from page 113 of

the Detainer Act."

QUESTION:

"Today is the first

Mr. Solovy, if we had a case on

1

habeas review from a decision in a lower Federal court,

20

under the notion expressed in Hill against the United

21

States, this might not be the kind of claim that would

22

survive on Federal habeas review from a Federal court.

We've required a complete miscarriage of justice, a

fundamental defect.

should apply on Federal habeas from a State court?

MR. SOLOVY:

1

No, I do not, Justice O'Connor.

As

2

we attempted to set forth in our brief, we think that the

3

Hill line of cases do not pertain.

4
5

QUESTION:
like 2255.

Well, we've treated, though, 2254

We've said they're essentially the same.
MR. SOLOVY:

6

Of course, in --

Yes.

7

distinction.

8

procedurally defaulted.

9

not appeal.

But there is a major

Of course, in Hill the defendant
As I recall, in that case he did

There is absolutely no procedural default in

10

this case.

11

beginning that he wanted his rights under the Interstate

12

Detainer Act enforced.

13

Mr. Reed cried out quite loudly from the

QUESTION:

But that's a different ground of

14

distinction.

15

don't apply when the case comes from a State court as from

16

a Federal court.

17

procedural default in Hill and there wasn't here.

18

Certainly, we've treated State court judgments in Federal

19

habeas just as -- with just as much deference.

20

we've gone out of our way to in the Davis and Francis line

21

of cases.

22

It's one thing to say that the same rules

It's another thing to say there's a

MR. SOLOVY:

In fact,

Chief Justice Rehnquist, I think

23

all courts are entitled to deference, State and Federal

24

courts alike.

25

should entertain a writ of habeas corpus from a State

court if the person, here Mr. Reed, is held in violation

2

of Federal law.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

But doesn't the text of 2255 say the

same thing about coming from a Federal court?
MR. SOLOVY:

It does.

But in -- the crucial

6

distinction, in our mind, is the fact that the 2255

7

petitioner had his or her day before a Federal court and

8

had his or her day for an opportunity to be heard before a
Federal appellate court.

Mr. Reed never had that

10

opportunity, certainly in the courts of Indiana, and

11

certainly we think the courts of Indiana misread the

12

Federal Interstate Detainer Act.

13

QUESTION:

And certainly --

Why isn't that an argument for a

14

different statute as opposed to a different definition of

15

the terms which are common to the two sections?

16
17
18

MR. SOLOVY:

I'm not sure, Justice Souter, I

understand your question.
QUESTION:

I mean --

Well, you're saying that the Federal

1

prisoner has already had certain chances for Federal

20

review that the State prisoner doesn't, which may be a

21

very good reason for having different -- having a

22

different statute governing the two cases.

23

statutes that we have are textually identical on the point

24

that you're concerned with.

25

MR. SOLOVY:

1

And it seems to me -- why aren't you

2

across the street making that argument, I guess is another

3

way to put the question.

4

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, we did make the argument, of

5

course, across the street.

6

the question is whether that's preclusive.

7

nothing that I read -QUESTION:

8

9
10

We did make it in Indiana, and
And there's

I think Justice Souter means why

didn't you ask Congress to amend the statute to make a
distinction between 2255 and State habeas.
MR. SOLOVY:

11

Well, because I think, if I read

12

correctly this Court's precedent -- and certainly I've

13

read a lot of this Court's precedents in preparation for

14

this argument -- this Court has never adopted what the

15

Solicitor General has suggested here, that a State

16

prisoner who has not procedurally defaulted, who has

17

properly preserved at every turn in the road his or her

18

right, does not have to show --

19

QUESTION:

Well, that's -- there you're making

20

an assumption that I don't think is quite settled on this

21

record.

22

120-day limit, but there was a crucial time when he

23

didn't, and usually you can't object to, say, the failure

24

to give a charge unless you object at the moment when the

25

judge could cure the error.

It's true that this petitioner referred to the

silent at the time when the judge could have cured the

error by setting the trial at a somewhat earlier date.

Well, we don't think, Justice

12

Number two, the statute speaks in

And number three, he certainly didn't waive it

13

because way within the time period, at the end of July and

14

early August, he filed written motions to the court saying

15

he should be tried within the time limits.

16

Justice Ginsburg, also said to him:

think under these circumstances there could be no waiver.

Now, Justice Souter, going back --

21

QUESTION:

So I

Mr. Solovy, before we leave this

22

point, I had thought -- I had thought we rejected the

23

proposal that 2255 and 2254 should be similarly

24

interpreted.

25

Indeed, I thought it was the basis for my separate writing

I thought we rejected that in Withrow.

in Withrow, that I thought we should treat them the same,

and I thought the Court said we shouldn't.

4

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, I certainly agree with that,

Justice Scalia.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SOLOVY:

I'd be happy to change that.
No, I think you should adhere to

7

your dissent and the reason for your dissent, and that's

8

the way I read Sunal, Hill, Davis.

dissent.

in Withrow.

You don't want me to adhere to my

You want the majority to adhere to its opinion

MR. SOLOVY:

12

Well, your dissent helps me to show

13

there's a distinction.

14

Court believes there's a distinction, and that's very

15

important for my position.

16
17

QUESTION:

At least you and I agree that the

I could be persuaded otherwise, I

suppose.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. SOLOVY:

Well, there -- if you can, Justice

20

Scalia -- if you can, then there is a very good reason.

21

Because, as I said before and as we said in our brief, the

22

2255 petitioner has had his or her day before a Federal

23

court and a Federal appellate court, if they chose.

24

Reed did not have that opportunity until he walked across

25

the street and filed his Federal habeas corpus.

Mr.

And I say

this is much akin to a jurisdictional argument.
QUESTION:

2

We rejected that kind of argument,

though, in our cases dealing with collateral estoppel and

estoppel by judgment.

right to a hearing once in a Federal court.

6

no, if you're stopped by judgment in the State court you

don't have a second round.

The argument there was you have a

MR. SOLOVY:

And we said

It's only an analogy.

It

I agree, and I agree that that's

10

where, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the analogy stops.

11

This is a very important writ.

It's a very

12

important right to a State prisoner, because we

13

respectfully submit Indiana did not get it right.

14

a gentlemen who is now 64-years-old who is going to -- he

15

has 11 years on a 34-year sentence for a $4,600 larceny.

16

He's not a Cinderfella.

17

still, he has served there 11 years and we believe that

18

had this Court reviewed this directly, he would be walking

19

free, because it's clear they did not comply with this

20

Act.

21

I mean he has a record.

Here is

But

Now -QUESTION:

Supposing this case had come from the

22

Federal courts and was subject to the Hill-Davis-Timmreck

23

line of reasoning, and you claimed a Speedy Trial Act

24

violation, right; do you think any sort of a Speedy Trial

25

Act violation could be raised in that situation?

1

MR. SOLOVY:

No, I think at that point the

2

gentlemen -- the prisoner would have been precluded

3

because he would have presented his claim to the Federal

4

district court and then to the appellate court, and I

5

assume certiorari was denied.

6

perhaps a compelling case could be made for him for

7

miscarriage of justice, unless he overcame a very-

8

substantial hurdle, he would be stuck in prison.
QUESTION:

And although I think

But I don't understand -- if the

10

reason -- the reasoning for the objection, for rejecting

11

the objection would be that it doesn't go to the fairness

12

of the trial and it doesn't go to guilt or innocence.

13

MR. SOLOVY:

14

QUESTION:

That's -That's the same thing here; that it

15

was some days more than 120 days doesn't go to guilt or

16

innocence or the fairness of the trial.

MR. ABEL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Before I outline our argument, I'd like to point

8

out one basic fact about the IAD, and that is simply that

9

it was not imposed by Congress upon the States.

10

Petitioner has suggested at various points that Congress

11

decided not to give the States this or that right, or

12

Congress said what it meant in the IAD.

13

is that the IAD was an agreement that the States

14

voluntarily entered into.

15

background and history of that in United States v. Mauro,

16

the underlying materials themselves detail that, and so I

17

wanted to make that point clear.

This Court detailed the

May I ask you about -- on that point,

which involved original actions, but also in cases on

certiorari from the State courts, that, in essence, this

5

Court must have the power to have the final say on -QUESTION:

7

But is that because the petition

would have raised a Federal question?
MR. ABEL:

8

9

And this Court has held in many cases

We don't dispute that there is a

Federal question involved in the IAD.

Absolutely, there

10

is a Federal -- there is -- I think in the words of one of

11

those compact clause cases, a Federal right, title,

12

privilege, or immunity, the Court didn't distinguish among

3

those in that particular case.

that --

And we also believe

If we can agree to that, what, then,

6

is the significance of the point that you made about this

7

not being an Act of Congress?

8

MR. ABEL:

9

That -- the significance of that, I

think, is that the term "laws of the United States," as

20

used in the habeas corpus statute, is, indeed, quite

21

different from the terms of the certiorari statute.

22

as this Court has noted, those terms take their meaning

23

from context.

That is, again, wholly different from both the

QUESTION:

So you're arguing this is not a law

of the United States within the meaning of the habeas
corpus statute.

11

MR. ABEL:

Exactly, Justice Stevens.

12

QUESTION:

Did you make that argument in your

13
14

brief in opposition to certiorari?
MR. ABEL:

We did not, Your Honor.

We felt

15

obligated to bring it to the Court's attention, however,

16

because it is jurisdictional.

17

And, so, again, we believe that it's necessary

18

to look at the purpose of the habeas corpus statute in

19

construing its terms.

20

QUESTION:

Indeed, this Court -Well, why is it jurisdictional?

You

21

say because the Federal courts shouldn't have entertained

22

a habeas petition based on a violation of that Act?

23

MR. ABEL:

That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

The language of the habeas corpus statutes, and in

25

particular 2254, says that a Federal district court "shall

1

entertain an application by a State prisoner only on the

2

ground that he is custody in violation of the Constitution

3

or laws or treaties of the United States."

4

QUESTION:

So that is --

Which is the same language that's

5

used in Article III of the Constitution, "Constitution,

6

laws, or treaty," so why does "laws" here mean something

7

different than it means under the -- under Article III?
MR. ABEL:

8

Well, again, it's because -- as this

Court has recognized, the very same language can mean
10

different things as it's used in different contexts.

For

11

example, this Court has consistently held that the

12

language of the arising under clause in Article III of the

13

Constitution is considerably broader than the general

14

Federal question statute, even though their text is

15

basically the same.

16

QUESTION:

I take it, then, you accept your

17

opponent's argument that what satisfies the requirement of

18

the law under the two sections, 54 and 55, may be

1

different?

20

MR. ABEL:

Um --

21

QUESTION:

And hence the standards applicable

22

should be different, which would defeat your Hill

23

argument.

24
25

MR. ABEL:

No, I don't believe so.

This Court

has rather consistently treated 2254 and 2255, despite

4

believe is one of them, and the Court may also have noted

5

that in Hill.

And, indeed, the Court noted that in some of the

itself also referred to the fundamental defect, inherent

10

miscarriage of justice standard and, of course, Stone was

11

a 2254 case.

12

So, in fact, we do believe that that standard

13

applies under either, and there is not a reason to

14

differentiate between the two.

15

any reason at all, it should be more difficult, rather

16

than less difficult, to get relief from the judgment of a

17

State court, because there is an overlay of Federalism

18

involved that simply is absent in 2255.

And to the extent there is

19

In terms of our jurisdictional argument -- and I

20

guess, by way of example of what we mean probably is a law

21

of the United States as opposed to what is not, I think

22

it's useful to look at some of the earlier cases under the

23

Habeas Corpus Act.

25

of a law of the United States.
3

I think it's also significant to note that -- or

4

at least to recognize that the drafters of the habeas

5

corpus statutes knew what interstate compacts were, most

6

likely, and they are certainly not listed as a ground for

7

habeas corpus relief.

8
9

)

The primary argument that petitioner seems to
make is that this Court's decisions in Cuyler v. Adams and

10

Carchman v. Nash foreclose the argument that we're making

11

here today.

12

Cuyler v. Adams was a section 1983 case rather than a

13

habeas corpus case, but more importantly, in that case

14

there were alleged violations of due process and equal

15

protection, so there was never any question about the

16

district court's jurisdiction there and the IAD was merely

17

construed in order to avoid reaching those constitutional

18

questions.

19
20
21

We don't believe that that is the case.

QUESTION:

But didn't we hold in one of those

cases that this was a Federal question?
MR. ABEL:

That's correct.

And we don't dispute

22

that it's a Federal question, but neither 22 -- section

23

2241 nor 2254 indicate that wherever there is a Federal

24

question involved, habeas corpus relief is appropriate.

25

QUESTION:

But what language did we construe in

1

whichever one of those cases it was that we decided there

2

was a Federal question?

3

MR. ABEL:

Well, in Cuyler, which I believe was

4

the case with the extended analysis, the Court didn't

5

purport to construe any particular statutory language.

6

simply said that the Third Circuit here has held that the

7

IAD presents questions of Federal law which there's

8

Federal power to construe, and we have to decide whether

9

that's right.

It

Again, no jurisdictional question was

10

involved and so, of course, the Court didn't refer to any

11

of the jurisdictional statutes.

12

Carchman v. Nash, another of the cases relied

13

upon by petitioner, simply did not explicitly discuss a

14

jurisdictional point.

15

held, where a case simply reaches the merits, as Carchman

16

did, without discussing the jurisdictional point, it's not

17

to be viewed as binding when the jurisdictional question

18

is subsequently squarely raised.

19

And as this Court has repeatedly

Fex v. Michigan we believe, frankly, in essence

20

proves our argument.

The Court granted certiorari, but

21

our argument basically is that the certiorari statute has

22

much different terms and different language than the

23

habeas corpus statutes.

24

we believe that there simply was not jurisdiction to

25

entertain the habeas corpus claim.

And so for all of those reasons,

28

1

Secondly, even if there were jurisdiction to

2

entertain the claim, relief should nonetheless be denied

3

for the reasons this Court gave in Stone v. Powell and the

4

analysis that it has followed and refined as recently as

5

last term in Withrow v.

6

analysis recognizes is that habeas corpus is an equitable

7

remedy and it is therefore discretionary.

8

28 U.S.C. section 2244 explicitly recognizes that the

9

granting of relief is discretionary.

QUESTION:

In essence, what that

The language of

May I ask if you are saying in this

IAD is a law of the United States, which I understand you

13

disagree with.

14

is it not correct that the prisoner is being held in

15

violation of a law of the United States and you're arguing

16

that nevertheless there should be equitable discretion not

17

to grant relief.

18

But if it is a law of the United States,

That's correct.

And, again, what

section 2243 specifies is that the Court should dispose of

the matter as law and justice require.

equitable discretion, and we believe Stone v. Powell,

1

Stone itself, and as this Court recognized in Withrow,

2

what it represents is a balancing of the need for habeas

3

corpus on the one hand and the costs of granting habeas

4

corpus on the other.

5

QUESTION:

Do you think in Stone the Court

6

assumed that the State prisoner was being held in

7

violation of the law of the United States?
MR. ABEL:

8

9

To the extent that the exclusionary

rule as developed by this Court, which is at least as

10

Federal as the IAD, is a law of the United States, then I

11

believe the Court was required to assume that.
QUESTION:

12

But when you say equitable

worse criminal so you wouldn't let him go.

2

QUESTION:

But don't you think there's some

3

truth to the argument made here that the Stone against

4

Powell was based not on the extent of habeas corpus, but

5

on the -- really, the construction of the exclusionary

6

rule?

7

MR. ABEL:

There's certainly language in Stone

8

to that effect.

If that were all Stone v. Powell were

9

about, however, it certainly would not have been necessary

10

for the Court to explore the contours of Stone on four

11

separate occasions, none of which involved the Fourth

12

Amendment, over a period of about 20 years.

13

Stone does represent something more than merely the scope

14

of the exclusionary rule, and I think that is clear from

15

the majority opinion last term in Withrow v. Williams.

16

QUESTION:

So I think

In Withrow -- I checked it briefly --

17

we did not cite Davis v. the United States, unless I'm

18

incorrect, and Davis v. United States was the case in

which we said these two statutes, 2254 and 2255, are

20

identical in scope.

QUESTION:

Well, but how do you square Withrow

with the statement in Davis, then?

5

MR. ABEL:

Well, we believe, in essence, that

6

Stone v. Powell and its rule represents a fact situation

7

or a rule-situation specific application of the

8

fundamental defect, inherent miscarriage of justice

9

standard; that, in essence, what Stone represents is the

10

Court's conclusion that an alleged violation of the

11

exclusionary rule in which, by hypothesis, evidence that

12

is perfectly trustworthy has been admitted, can never

13

amount to a fundamental defect that inherently results in

14

a complete miscarriage of justice.

15

So we think there's a close relationship to the

16

two, and, in fact, Stone adverted to the fundamental

17

defect test from Hill and Davis.

18

very close relationship between the two.

12

The Court in Withrow -- I believe the language

in the opinion is that the Court had substantial -- had

reason to believe that substantially all Miranda claims

QUESTION:

The

No, but may I suggest this

8

distinction on Stone against Powell.

Can one not read

9

Stone against Powell as saying that the defendant was held

10

pursuant to a State court judgment that may have been

11

obtained in a proceeding in which a procedural violation

12

of the law of the United States occurred, rather than

13

being held in direct violation of the law of the United

14

States.

15

of the United States, the petitioner here is being held in

16

violation of that law because it mandatorily requires his

17

release.

18

Which is -- if one assumes that the IAD is a law

Isn't that a distinction?
MR. ABEL:

Well, it mandatorily requires

19

dismissal of the charges.

release in the sense of habeas corpus --

QUESTION:

To say that it requires his

Well, there's no jurisdiction to hold

22

him other than pursuant to the charges that would have

23

been dismissed.

MR. ABEL:

Well, certainly, that's the basis of

petitioner's detention, is the judgment of conviction.

1

But I believe, as was pointed out in some of the earlier

2

colloquy during petitioner's arguments, that the IAD

3

represents, more appropriately, something akin to a

4

statute of limitations than a jurisdictional rule, and a

5

statute of limitations is generally not understood to be

jurisdictional in the sense necessary to give rise for --

QUESTION:

Why is he -- if it is a law of the

law of the United States?

MR. ABEL:

Well, among other things, because

the Federal district.

during which the prisoner is unable to stand trial.

So that whenever such a motion is

I would also like to --

on by the court below.
On the -- the other points, I guess, on the

11
12

Stone analysis -- apart from the notion that this is, in

essence, unrelated to the soundness of the trial, we also

14

know that it's not a federally imposed obligation.

15

even if it technically is a Federal law of some species

16

enough to confer jurisdiction, which we don't think it is,

we believe the essentially non-Federal nature of it is an

additional equitable factor counseling against the grant
