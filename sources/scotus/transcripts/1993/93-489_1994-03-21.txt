CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Insurance Corporation.

Mr. Lee.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEE:

8

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
At issue in this case is whether Federal or

11

State law determines the elements and the defenses of a

12

negligence claim brought by the FDIC as receiver for a

13

savings and loan against an outside attorney for that

14

savings and loan.

15

The case arises out of the petitioner's

16

assisting in the preparation of two private placement

17

memoranda for American Diversified Savings Bank over the

18

period from September through December of 1985.

19

and prior to that time, two individuals named Sahni and

20

Day, who owned 100 percent of ADSB, were engaged and had

21

been for some time in fraudulent and other illegal

22

activities which eventually resulted in Federal and State

23

regulators placing ADSB into receivership.

24
25

During

None of the O'Melveny lawyers was aware of any
of the illegal acts, nor are they alleged to have been,

nor of ADSB's financial or regulatory problems and,

2

indeed, the ADSB officers concealed this information from

3

the petitioner.

4

The Ninth Circuit created two Federal rules of

5

decision:

6

owners was not imputed to ADSB, and second, that the FDIC

7

can avoid defenses to tort claims that would be good

8

against the predecessor, ADSB.

9

first, that the knowledge of ADSB's 100 percent

In response to an argument by the petitioner

10

11

Circuit stated as follows, and this is a quote:

Mr. Lee, you don't challenge, I take

it, the Ninth Circuit's view that a law firm in this

situation is under a duty of inquiry when it prepares a

private prospectus like this?

20

MR. LEE:

We do challenge it, Mr. Chief Justice,

21

but it's not one of the issues -- we think they erred as a

22

matter of California law in deciding that.

That's the issue on which --

MR. LEE:

That's the issue.

But if any State law governs -Oh, yes, that is correct.
-- it's California.
That is correct.

It is the law of California, and do

we know what the law of California is on the imputation

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

Excuse me.
There are very few cases on this

imputation defense, and it doesn't seem all that clear to

21

me what the California law might be in any event.

22

23

MR. LEE:

There are enough, Justice O'Connor,

and I would refer you simply to four.

The leading case is McKenney v. Ellsworth.

1

MR. LEE:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- would you tell us preliminarily

3

whether the Ninth Circuit made any determination of the

4

content of California law, because if it did not, perhaps

5

it might on remand and a conflict would be unnecessary.

6

There would be no conflict.
You presented a question,

7

is it State or Federal

8

law, but if the content of both is the same,

9

difference does it make?
MR. LEE:

10

then what

Well, the case certainly could be

11

decided on the ground that under Federal common law as it

12

existed -- and we discussed this briefly in our reply

13

brief -- as it existed prior to Erie v. Tompkins, we think

14

we would win this case, but the clearer -- the ground on

15

which certiorari was granted, and I think the clearer and

16

the easier way to decide the case,

17

of State law.

18

is to decide the issue

Now, the other question that you asked, Justice

19

Ginsburg, was whether the Ninth Circuit had decided this

20

on the basis of State or Federal law.

21

they decided it on the basis of Federal law,

22

reasons.

23

It is clear to me
for three

The first is that that's what they said they

24

were doing.

25

in O'Melveny's argument is its assumption that State law

The language that I just quoted said the flaw

1

applies.

It is now clear that Federal law applies to all

2

defenses -- not just defense, but defenses -- in a suit

3

brought by the FDIC, and the second is what they did.
The opinion relies on three Federal opinions.

4
5

It does not rely on State law, and in an analogous

6

context -- Michigan v. Long -- this Court said that when

7

the opinion relies on Federal decisions, then they are

8

applying Federal law.
QUESTION:

9

Mr. Lee, why should -- assuming that

10

they did rely on Federal law, why shouldn't we give them

11

the job of - - I mean, we have enough trouble figuring out

12

what Federal law is.

13

Why don't we -- if you're correct -- just send it back

14

there and let them figure out what California law is?
MR. LEE:

15
16

19

That would be a possibility, Justice

Scalia.

17
18

They're closer to California law.

QUESTION:

It's what we normally would do,

it?
MR. LEE:

That would be a possibility, and in

20

the usual case,

21

this is not the usual case.

22

isn't

that is what you normally do.

I submit

The only thing I would say in that respect,

23

Justice Scalia,

is that I would invite careful

24

consideration of four cases that are cited in our brief,

25

and those four cases make it very clear -- it's probably

best summarized by the West American case and by

2

Mr. Witkin, who is the leading commentator on California

3

law.

4

The Government points out, quite correctly, that

5

there is an exception to the general rule of imputation in

6

those instants where the agent is acting adversely to the

7

principal, but in the clearest language of the which the

8

English dictionary is capable, it then goes on to say --

9

in the clearest words of which the English language is

10

capable, it then goes on to say that there is an exception

11

to the exception, and that the exception to the exception

12

applies in those instances where the agent is in fact

13

acting on behalf of its principal, and there is no doubt

14

that that's what happened here.

15

QUESTION:

So - -

Mr. Lee, can you give us instances in

16

which this Court functions as a court of first view, which

17

is essentially what you're asking us to do?

18

The Ninth Circuit -- instead of asking the Ninth

19

Circuit to determine the content of California law, you're

20

asking this Court to decide a question not on review but

21

as a mater of first view.

22

MR. LEE:

There are cases that are cited in the

23

last couple of pages of our reply brief, Justice Ginsburg,

24

in which this Court has done that.

25

not the only option, but I would simply reiterate what I

I realize that that is

said in response to Justice Scalia.
I would invite the Court's attention to

2

3

McKenney, West American, Flagg v.Seng, and Austin, and I

4

submit that no reasonable person can read those cases

5

without concluding what California law is.

6

not lose the case in the event that you do send it back

7

for consider -- I just don't think it's necessary in this

8

instance.

9
10

QUESTION:

However, we do

California have a certification

proceeding?

11

MR. LEE:

They do not, unfortunately.

12

The first -- there are three separate reasons

13

why the judgment of the Ninth Circuit must be reversed

14

and - - and State rather than Federal law apply to this

15

case, and the first is that there is a specific statutory

16

provision which expressly addresses both the imputation

17

and also the standing-in-the-shoes issues and resolves

18

both of them.

19

Section 1821(d)(2)(A) of the Federal Deposit

20

Insurance Act, which bears the title,

"Successor to

21

institution," states explicitly -- and this is a quote.

22

It's set forth in the first page of our opening brief --

23

that as conservator or receiver, the FDIC succeeds to "all

24

rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the insured

25

depository institution."

Now, in this instance, the insured depository

1

2

institution is a California chartered corporation.

As

3

such, its rights are determined by California law, and

4

relevant California law, as I indicated, imputes the

5

knowledge of an agent to his principal, and on the second

6

issue, whether the FDIC is --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. LEE:

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Lee, may I --- a receiver -I'm sorry.

10

MR. LEE:

I'm sorry.

11

QUESTION:

12

It seems to me that the defense that is at issue

May I ask just one question?

13

here is essentially an equitable defense, and as such is

14

essentially a personal defense, and therefore the cause of

15

action may pass but the defense doesn't necessarily pass

16

with it.

17

California law?

18
19

Is that a fair objection to the argument from

MR. LEE:

Thank you for asking that question,

Justice Souter, for two reasons --

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. LEE:

22

(Laughter.)

23

MR. LEE:

I'm flattered.
Well, I --

For two reasons, the answer is no.

24

The first is that the right -- the word is not claims,

25

it's rights, and you don't have a right unless you have a

1

claim and there are no defenses to it.
The second is provided - - the second reason is

2

3

provided by this Court's decision in Holmes, v. Sipek,

4

which was authored by the Court, by you, and that makes

5

clear -- that case makes clear, as I read it, that

6

proximate causation is an essential element of the claim

7

itself.

8

And under California law, the reason that there

9

is no proximate causation is because justifiable reliance

10

is a required element of proximate causation, and there

11

was no justifiable reliance where all you are saying is,

12

should the O'Melveny lawyers have told Sahni and Day that

13

they were - - discovered that Sahni and Day were violating

14

the law and then told them so?

15

QUESTION:

On the second issue --

Mr. Lee, while you're still on the

16

statute -- and I'm anxious for you also to get to the

17

second point - - I take it the wording of the statute in

18

its structure would prevent us from saying that the

19

initial liability, the initial duty,

20

Federal law?

21

MR. LEE:

is also controlled by

That is correct, and that's my

22

point -- that's my point, and on the other, on the

23

standing-in-the-shoes,

24

because it says, succeeds to all rights the depository

25

institution has, and that strikes right at the heart of

1

the major premise that underlies the Government's case,

2

namely that the mere presence of the FDIC as receiver

3

2-1/2 years after the conduct at issue imposed for that

4

reason alone upon petitioner additional liabilities which

5

did not exist at the time the conduct occurred.

6

Now my second reason.

If you didn't have the

7

specific statute, the mere existence of FIRREA, with its

8

comprehensiveness, this 370-page statute controls the

9

issue of whether State or Federal law governs under this

10
11

Court's decision in City of Milwaukee v. Illinois.
Involved in that case was a comprehensive

12

statute, the 1972 amendments to the Clean Water Act, and

13

the question was, when you have that kind of statute,

14

which supplants preexisting State rules in some instances

15

and leaves them in place in other instances, is it then

16

the proper function for the Federal courts to come along

17

behind and displace State law in those instances where

18

Congress elected to leave them in place?

19

The Government's only answer to that City of

20

Milwaukee argument is that FIRREA is not in fact

21

comprehensive, and that, with all due respect, is

22

borderline laughable.

23

with its companion statutes, regulates all aspects of

24

banks, Federal savings and --

It,

1

MR. LEE:

Excuse me.

2

QUESTION:

--do you think that under your

3

theory of FIRREA that the D'Oench, Duhme case could

4

survive?

5

MR. LEE:

Yes.

Yes,

it could.

D'Oench, Duhme,

6

Justice O'Connor,

is going to help the Government only if

7

you interpret it not in light of what that case actually

8

involved, but as establishing a per se, automatic rule
that any time the FDIC enters the playing field the

10

playing field no longer becomes level, and if you'll

11

permit the further analogy, any players who are wearing a

12

State law uniform not favorable to the Government

13

immediately have to leave.

14

Now, that's not what D'Oench, Duhme says.

It is

15

limited in several respects and is distinguishable from

16

this case in several respects.

17

involved knowing conduct, which this case does not.

18

In the second place,

In the first place,

it

it involved a note, an

1

asset as opposed to a mere claim, and the third - - as I

20

read D'Oench, heavy reliance was placed on the fact that

21

between the time the conduct occurred and the time the

22

decision was reached, there was a Federal statute that was

23

actually enacted, and that Federal statute heavily

24

influenced the decision so that what the Court was really

25

doing was filling in a vacuum that existed in between the

Wrongdoers of a certain ---an imputation defense?
Yes.

Wrongdoers of a certain quality,

8

not those who only have been alleged, and I repeat in - -

9

what I said earlier to the Chief Justice.

We do not agree

10

that there was a lack of exercise of due care, but that's

11

not before the Court.

12

Though a difference between those who are

13

alleged not to have exercised due care and those who have

14

engaged in deliberate conduct --

15

QUESTION:

Well, you agree, then, that the

purpose of the defense would be so that Sahni and Day

wouldn't benefit from any recovery?

Would it be the taxpayers of the United

MR. LEE:

Difficult to say whether the taxpayers

would really benefit or not, Justice O'Connor.
If I may tie that to our Kimbell Foods analysis,
and that's the third reason -- that's the third reason

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that this case must be reversed.

2

Foods factors has to do with whether there is a need for a

3

particular Federal rule in the particular instance.

4

One of the three Kimbell

The only argument that the Government even makes

5

with respect to why a special Federal rule is needed here

6

is the more money argument, that because otherwise it

7

would deplete the Deposit Insurance Fund.
I cannot emphasize too strongly that this

8

9

argument that the application of Federal law will result

10

in the FDIC recovering more money is entitled to no weight

11

at all, and I'm going to tie this back to your taxpayer's

12

question.

13

Kimbell Foods itself rejected that very

14

argument, and it did so on two grounds that are highly

15

relevant to this case.

16

as in Kimbell Foods the relevant statute provides other

17

means, other than just getting more money into the Federal

18

Deposit Insurance Fund, for protecting the public.

19

These include the ability of the Federal

The first one is that in this case

20

regulators to increase both the capital and the capital-

21

to-assets ratios, to increase the insurance premium, and

22

in extreme cases even to remove management, and even more

23

relevant, it is also true here, as it was in Kimbell

24

Foods, that the principal purpose of these insurance

25

statutes is not to raise money.

Kimbell Foods made that very explicit, and I

1

2

would point out that what Kimbell Foods involved was two

3

Federal insurance programs, one administered by the SBA

4

and the other administered by the FHA, and Kimbell Foods

5

pointed out that these are social welfare legislation

6

statutes.

7

statutes.

8

9

Unlike tax statutes, they are not money-raising

The same is true with the Federal Deposit -well, with these various acts, FIRREA and the Federal

10

Deposit Insurance Act, whose principal purposes extend to

11

economic incentives to encourage residential lending, the

12

development of low and moderate income housing, and

13

lending in depressed real estate markets.

14

QUESTION:

I don't understand your point,

15

Mr. Lee -- that Government doesn't care about losing money

16

unless it's under the tax laws.

17

preserving the fisc is an important value, it's an

18

important value, in whatever context.

19

MR. LEE:

I mean, it seems to me if

The point is, Justice Scalia, that it

20

is not its only purpose, and that in balancing the various

21

different objectives, of which protecting the public fisc

22

is of course one of them, the clear message that comes

23

from Milwaukee and from Kimbell Foods and a lot of other

24

cases that are cited in our brief dealing with this issue,

25

the net balancing of those competing values is for the

1

Congress of the United States, particularly where, as in

2

City of Milwaukee - - and here you have such a

3

comprehensive statute where many defenses have been

4

eliminated and others left intact, and particularly where,

5

as here, you have other objectives,

money raising.

7

and not for the courts.

The balancing, in short,

is for Congress,

I return now to the other two of the Kimbell

8
9

other than just the

Foods factors.

The first one is whether there's a need

10

for a uniform Federal law.

The Government's conduct in

11

this very case shows that there is no such need.
What the Government did in this particular

12

13

instance was to ask for the application, and the court of

14

appeals gave it to them, of what they perceived to be

15

State law on the first issue, Mr. Chief Justice, which was

16

the issue of whether there was a duty of due ca;re that was

17

owed.

18

Then, once they turned to the imputation and the

19

standing-in-the-shoes issues, on which State law does not

20

favor them, then the Government changed its direction and

21

asked for the application of Federal common law, which the

22

Ninth Circuit gave them.

23

This Court made very clear in Kimbell Foods, but

24

even more clear in United States v. Yazell,

25

Government attempts this mix-and-match, pick-and-choose

that when the

1

combination of Federal and State law and asks for State

2

law to be applicable in certain instances, that that is

3

immensely material in the language of Yazell, immensely

4

material to the issue of whether a uniform rule really is

5

needed.

6

The final of the Kimbell Foods factors concerns

7

whether a Federal rule of decision would severely disrupt

8

commercial relationships predicated on State law.

9

we're dealing with here is two areas of State law than

What

10

which there are none clearer, that are the essential and

11

traditional centuries -long prerogative of the State

12

courts -- tort law, disciplining of lawyers, and the

13

related one, the relationship of lawyer and client.

14

Each of these represents an area in which the

15

body of government State law has been developed over

16

decades, and in some cases even centuries, and to now

17

place that burden in Federal courts, displacing those

18

bodies of governmental State concern, would not only

19

severely disrupt commercial relationships predicated on

20

State law, but would also be extremely burdensome on the

21

Federal courts.

22

Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve the

23

rest of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BENDER:

3
4

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Petitioner in this case is a law firm that was

5
6

retained by a federally insured savings institution in

7

order to prepare what are called private placement

8

memoranda in connection with the saving institution's

9

offering of a land development scheme.
It is alleged, and for purposes of this appeal

10

11

we have to assume it's true, that in the course of

12

preparing that PPM - - private placement memorandum - -

13

petitioner committed malpractice.

14

Specifically, the malpractice that they

15

committed -- were alleged to have committed was this.

16

private placement memorandum says in it that the bank in

17

this case had sufficient resources to finance the land

18

development scheme that the bank was floating.

19

not true.

That was

As a matter of fact, the bank was insolvent.
The negligence that is asserted against

20
21

petitioner is that they negligently failed to discover

22

that, and put in the PPM that the bank was in fact

23

solvent, and that assets would be there to lend to the

24

partnership for the purposes of the land development

25

proj ect.

The

1

If petitioner had discovered, as it should have,

2

that the bank was insolvent, it never could have put that,

3

and never would have put that, in the PPM, and the scheme

4

would not have gone forward.

5

The allegation is that because the scheme went

6

forward, that cost the bank a substantial amount of money.

7

It did that because shortly after the scheme closed,

8

Federal regulators came in, discovered that the bank was

9

insolvent, and once the bank was insolvent, the land

10

development project couldn't go forward because the assets

11

of the bank were necessary for that project to go forward.
So petitioner's negligence directly related to

12

13

the viability of this project, and by negligently failing

14

to discover that the bank was insolvent, petitioner hurt

15

the bank.

MR. BENDER:

Because the law firm certification

15

is necessary for shares in this partnership to be sold.

16

If the law firm had said, we can't prepare this PPM

because the bank isn't solvent, and therefore we can't say

to potential investors that the funds are there to fund

the development project, then the development project

20

wouldn't have gone forward.

That's the causality.

be a different matter, but they've already been made

No, I don't think that's correct.

the harm here by petitioner's negligence is not harm to

Well, Federal law initially

as the State law adequately protects the Federal interest.

Mr. Bender, would you clarify,

be modified to protect the Federal interest?

standing in the shoes, it deals with that expressly and on

its own.
But let me just cut right through, Justice

3
4

Stevens, and tell you that the real answer to this is that

5

the claims of the creditors are not involved in this case

6

for two separate and independently sufficient reasons.

7

The first is that under this Court's decision in Dietrich

8

v. Standard Surety, in order for the FDIC to assert claims

9

on behalf of creditors, those have to be alleged and

10

proven.

They have been neither in this case.
Moreover, under this Court's recent decision in

11
12

Holmes v. Sipek, they could not be proven.

13

in the language of that decision there is too much -- the

14

link is too remote between the O'Melveny & Myers law firm

15

and those creditors.

16

Why?

Because

This is not -- the proximate cause defense is

17

not just a -- it's not just a defense, it is also an

18

element of the claim, as Holmes v. Sipek makes very clear.

19

The Ninth Circuit did not rely on the claims of

creditors when it originally brought this suit, and those

claims of creditors simply are not at issue in this case.

job, then, of the lawyers for the Federal Government and

the Federal courts to come along behind and declare what

Federal policy is.

20

Now, with regard to causation, the only way that

21

the Government can satisfy the causation responsibility in

22

this case is to argue for a but-for House-That-Jack-Built

23

type of causation.

talking about in this instance if California law applies,

as it must, is proximate causation and not but-for

There's always some mixing and

matching.
MR. LEE:

Exactly, and we don't object to that.

4

All we object to is the Government, in those instances

5

when it does mix and match, come in and then say that it's

6

absolutely essential to have a uniform body of law,

7

because as this Court said in Yazell, that is rejected by

their own conduct.

QUESTION:

With regard to the second, we have

10

heard nothing in response to what this Court said in

11

Kimbell Foods that there are two other purposes that

12

underlie these Federal insurance statutes, and these

13

Federal insurance statutes do have other purposes.

14

And with regard to that, Justice O'Connor, as to

15

how the taxpayers and the citizens will ultimately be

16

served, let me just turn Mr. Bender's point around and ask

17

us to put ourselves in the position of the O'Melveny

18

partners when the next case comes up in which they're

19

asked to represent a savings and loan and the Ninth

20

Circuit law still remains in place.

21

Probably the reaction is going to be, we don't

22

know what law is going to apply, we don't know what has

23

happened, we have no - - absolutely no indication at this

24

time of any wrongdoing, and we certainly didn't in this

instance, let's just stay out of it altogether.
