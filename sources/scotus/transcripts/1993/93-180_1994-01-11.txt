ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. POPE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. POPE:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
The previous case considered the relationships

11
12

in a maritime tort system between the claimants and the

13

nonsettling tortfeasors.

14

consider the relationship in a maritime tort system

15

between the settling tortfeasor and the nonsettling

16

tortfeasors.

In this case, we're going to

17

This proceeding arises from a limitation of

18

liability case filed as a result of an accident which

19

occurred on the navigable waters of the United States.

20

The accident was a collision between a sailboat and an

21

electric power line in a place called Gasparilla Pass on

22

the West Coast of Florida.

23

Boca Grande Club was the owner of the sailboat.

24

Florida Power & Light Company was the owner of the power

25

line.

The sailboat had been rented to Dr. Robert

1

Polackwich, who was a member of the club, and his stepson,

2

Jonathan Richards.

3

died from electrocution as a result of the collision.

4

Boca Grande Club started this limitation case, and claims

5

were filed in the action by the Polackwich and Richards

6

personal representatives, relatives of the deceased,

7

Florida Power & Light Company, and O'Day Corporation, the

8

sailboat's manufacturer.

9

Both Dr. Polackwich and Mr. Richards

Boca Grande Club filed a motion for summary

10

judgment with the district court as to all claims, based

11

on the contention that the collision was solely caused by

12

the fact that Florida Power & Light Company did not erect

13

and maintain the power line at the minimum height above

14

the navigable waters as required by the Army Corps of

15

Engineers permit.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Pope, I suppose the disposition

17

of this case will depend in large part on the disposition

18

of the case we've just heard.

19

MR. POPE:

I would agree, Your Honor.

The

20

choice between a proportionate credit rule and a pro tanto

21

or dollar-for-dollar deduction rule would, if the Court

22

selects a proportional credit rule, basically eliminate

23

any claim for contribution as an operation of law.

24

claim would not arise.

Grande Club summary judgment as to the contribution claims

*4

of Florida Power & Light Company following settlement with

3

the Polackwich and Richards Claimants.

4

summary judgment granted by the district court was the

5

decision of the Eleventh Circuit in Self v. Great Lakes,

6

which had recognized the settlement bar rule with respect

7

to contribution claims.

The basis of the

styled Great Lakes v. Tanker, before the time to appeal

me.

12

rule announced in Self was dicta, and said that both

13

settling and nonsettling tortfeasors could sue for

14

contribution.

The Great Lakes case held that the settlement bar

15

The Great Lakes Tanker case does not place a

16

limitation as to whether the party bringing the

17

contribution claim is one who himself has settled, or one

18

who is seeking contribution from a party who already

19

settled.

20

Florida Power & Light Company appealed the

21

summary judgment, and the Eleventh Circuit reversed on the

22

basis of its decision in Great Lakes.

23

The relief Boca Grande Club seeks is reversal of

24

the ruling by the Eleventh Circuit and establishment of a

25

rule in this case that will allow it to be protected from

1

contribution claims.

regardless of which settlement credit the Court may adopt

3

as a result of the McDermott case.
QUESTION:

4

This relief can be accomplished

May I ask you, Mr. Pope, just so --

5

has there been a determination in the litigation as to the

6

proportionate responsibility of the co-defendants?
MR. POPE:

7

There has been a -- Your Honor, there

8

has been no determination of Boca Grande Club's

9

contributory fault for the collision.

Your question will

10

require me to go outside the record to state that in the

11

State court trial between the Polackwich claimants and

12

Florida Power & Light Company, there was a determination

13

of proportionate fault between those parties and the

14

allocation of fault was 65 percent for Florida Power &

15

Light and 35 percent for the Polackwich-Richards

16

claimants.

17
18

QUESTION:

So there would not be an issue on

remand as to what the - -

19

MR. POPE:

No, sir.

20

QUESTION:

-- correct division was?

21

MR. POPE:

Nc, sir, at least not as the case

22

23

presently stands.
QUESTION:

I should point out -The reason I raise the question --

24

the plaintiff isn't here, as I understand it -- is not a

25

party to this proceeding.

1

MR. POPE:

That is correct, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

And conceivably could have an

3

interest in what the allocation could be if Boca Grande is

4

out of the case.

5

MR. POPE:

Yes, sir, and I would also believe

6

that the claimants would have a great interest in this

7

Court's decision in the McDermott case, since the verdict

8

and judgments in the State court of Florida are on appeal

9

at the present time.

10

QUESTION:

Well, if the Court in the preceding

11

case were to adopt a proportionate fault rule -- I don't

12

know that it will, but if it did, what would be our best

13

disposition of this case, just to vacate and remand?

14

MR. POPE:

Justice O'Connor, I believe that

15

would be correct, because the cause of action upon which

16

Florida Power & Light Company sues -- namely, the

17

contribution claim - - would cease to exist as a matter of

18

law, because it could not be paying more than its

19

proportionate share of the fault, period, so there would

20

be no -- the contribution as a theoretical right would

21

exist, but not for them.

22

As Justice O'Connor has indicated, under the

23

proportionate credit, or sometimes it's been called the

24

pro rata rule, the nonsettling tortfeasor receives a

25

credit for the settling tortfeasor's concurrent fault.

1

The nonsettling tortfeasor is held responsible only for

2

its own fault.

3

the nonsettling tortfeasor is not being held liable for

4

anyone's fault but its own.

No claim for contribution exists, since

We would suggest, however, that even under a

5
6

proportionate credit or pro rata rule, a settlement bar

7

would still be necessary because of the ruling of the

8

Eleventh Circuit in Great Lakes v. Tanker, which permitted

9

settling tortfeasors to seek contribution.

Under those

10

circumstances, it is conceivable that there could be a

11

complete settlement between all of the parties, and

12

nonetheless one of the settling parties believing it had

13

paid too much, institute contribution actions against

14

others.

15

QUESTION:

But if this Court went the other way

16

in the McDermott case, then wouldn't the Great Lakes --

17

wouldn't that have to be reconsidered, or - -

18

MR. POPE:

I'm sorry --

19

QUESTION:

If this Court adopts proportionate

20

fault as the rule --

21

MR. POPE:

Yes, ma'am.

22

QUESTION:

-- then doesn't the Eleventh Circuit

23

have to rethink its position?

24

MR. POPE:

25

Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

The

Eleventh Circuit's position was to adopt a pro tanto, or

1

dollar-for-dollar deduction, and allow full contribution

2

as a means by a two-step or more procedure to achieve what

3

is in effect the proportionate credit rule.
QUESTION:

4

So Great Lakes would essentially be

5

wiped out if this Court should adopt the proportionate

6

fault.

7

MR. POPE:

That's correct.

8

QUESTION:

There was some suggestion that the

9

Edmonds case impeded the Eleventh Circuit from adopting a

10

proportionate fault position.

11

MR. POPE:

The suggestion was that the Edmonds

12

result dictated that with respect to the seamen, who were

13

the personal injury claimants in the Great Lakes scenario,

14

which is -- it starts with Ebanks, it goes to Self, and

15

then it goes to Great Lakes v. Tanker, that Edmonds -- the

16

decision of this Court in Edmonds, recognizing joint and

17

several liability, placed one of the defendants, the Great

18

Lakes defendant in that case, in a situation where it, as

19

a 30-percent-responsible-for-the-collision party, would

20

end up paying 100 percent of the damages, whereas the 70-

21

percent- at- fault party, the Chevron vessel, which had

22

already made a settlement with all of the personal injury

23

claimants, would not be responding unless contribution

24

were allowed.

25

QUESTION:

You say that the State court action

1

is still alive, it's not dead.

I mean, if that were

2

completely terminated and we adopted the proportional

3

rule, or the pro rata -- whatever you want to call it --

4

there'd be a pretty mess to sort out, wouldn't there?

5

MR. POPE:

Yes, sir.

6

QUESTION:

But that's not the case, you say.

7

MR. POPE:

No, sir.

8

QUESTION:

The State action is still alive.

9

MR. POPE:

The State action was -- the

10

settlement between Boca Grande Club and the Polackwich-

11

Richards claimants occurred in - - I believe it was

12

September-October of 1990.

13

Richards claimants and Florida Power & Light took place in

14

the State courts of Florida, I believe it was in February-

15

March of 1993, and is currently on appeal.

16

The case between Polackwich-

We would suggest that even .under the pro tanto

17

or dollar-for-dollar credit, this Court can nonetheless

18

find that a settlement bar rule should be effective.

19

Under a pro tanto credit, the nonsettling tortfeasor

20

receives a credit against the claimants' damages equal to

21

that paid by the settling tortfeasor.

22

Under a pro tanto credit, unlike the

23

proportional fault rule, a settlement bar -- an explicit

24

settlement bar is required, because it is possible, as we

25

have heard in the prior argument, that the dollar amount

1

of the settlement will not equal the settling tortfeasor's

2

proportional fault for the casualty.

3

it could be lower, he made a good bargain, he may not have

4

made a good bargain.

5

It could be higher,

It is still possible, under a pro tanto regime,

6

that all parties will settle.

In fact, that's what

7

happened in the Great Lakes case.

8

Court of Appeals found a pro tanto or dollar-for-dollar

9

deduction which --we invite the Court to examine all

The Eleventh Circuit

10

three opinions -- has never taken place yet in that case.

11

The amount paid by Chevron has never been accounted for to

12

this day in that case, but nonetheless there was a pro

13

tanto deduction where the right of contribution came up.

14

QUESTION:

15

What do you mean - -

16

MR. POPE:

I don't understand what you mean.

I'm sorry, because what happened in

17

the Great Lakes case was that Chevron early on settled

18

with all of the personal injury claimants who were crew

19

members of the other vessel.

20

the other vessel and employer of the crewmen, did not

21

settle with its employees because the employees had claims

22

under the Jones Act and for unseaworthiness that they did

23

not have against Chevron as the owner of the other vessel.

24
25

Great Lakes, the owner of

In point of fact, throughout the case, Chevron
settled early on, Great Lakes settled with Self, the last

1

remaining claimant, after the second appeal to the

2

Eleventh Circuit, so in fact all the claims were settled,

3

none of them were ever tried, and the district court in

4

the Great Lakes remand is now faced with the unhappy

5

prospect of trying eleven separate personal injury actions

6

between two settling defendants on damages for people that

7

10 years ago left the lawsuit.
In fact, the district court entered an order on

8

9

December 22nd in that case scheduling the case for trial

10

the weeks - - during the trial term beginning in April of

11

1994.

12

The Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act

13

and the Restatement of Torts (Second) in 886A recognized

14

this type of credit, but I would point out that the

15

Restatement lists all the credits that are possible, a

16

proportionate, a pro tanto credit, and a settlement bar

17

with a good faith hearing requirement.

18

We would submit that any good faith hearing

19

requirement under a pro tanto credit regime, which goes

20

beyond satisfying the court that the agreement between the

21

settling parties is noncollusive, would have an extremely

22

adverse effect on settlements.

23

In effect, there would be a minitrial, trying to

24

equate the settling parties' fault or proportional fault

25

and damages in advance of the main trial, which would

would be subject to appeal, and the benefit derived to the

settling tortfeasor of being able to close his books on

amount of time.

There would probably be an

settlement in this regard?

11

collusion.

12

What do

That's

It has to be.
MR. POPE:

Your Honor, I believe -- and I will

13

advert to a decision, the recent decision of the Florida

14

supreme court, because I heard the word Mary Carter

15

agreement in an earlier argument, and there is a decision

16

that was just announced in the Florida supreme court along

17

with several other decisions that had to do with Florida's

18

adoption of a comparative fault regime which outlawed Mary

19

Carter agreements.

20

And basically the thrust of that opinion, which

21

is called Dasdorian -- I can't remember the second name of

22

the party, but the Dasdorian case said that henceforth in

23

Florida we're not going to allow cases to go forward where

24

as part of the settlement agreement the settling defendant

25

either agrees to participate in the trial and lay off

1

blame, or help the plaintiff lay off blame on the

2

nonsettling defendants, or agrees to assist or aid the

3

claimant in some way that is improper.

4
5
6

QUESTION:

Is that a Mary Carter agreement, what

you've just described?
MR. POPE:

Yes, sir.

A Mary Carter agreement is

7

an agreement whereby, at least as I understand it in

8

Florida, whereby a defendant secretly settles with the

9

plaintiff but nonetheless agrees to participate in the

10

trial and assist the plaintiff in the prosecution of the

11

claim against the nonsettling defendant, and the Florida

12

courts have outlawed that.

13

The -- I would like to note that the agreement

14

that was described to you earlier in the prior argument is

15

what I would call in Florida a high-low agreement.

16

is, an agreement whereby a defendant agrees to settle, and

17

if you recover X dollars from the nonsettling defendant,

18

I'll pay you this, but if you don't get that much, I'll

19

pay you X plus something else, and that's called a high-

20

low agreement, and the Florida said that kind of

21

agreement's okay, as long as you don't procure assistance

22

to subvert the trial process.

23

try to do is protect the nonsettling defendant's day in

24

court, as I understand.

1

which is the Eleventh Circuit rule, is adopted, any

2

settlements in a multiparty maritime tort case will be

3

extremely unlikely.

4

The settling tortfeasor is subject to the results of the

5

trial he does not participate in.

6

this very matter, the Polackwich and Richards claim trial,

7

went to trial in the State court, which resulted in an

8

$8.7 million verdict.

9

QUESTION:

I say this for the following reasons.

In the instant case,

Mr. Pope, I hate to -- I'm getting an

10

education from you, so I hope you don't mind one more

11

question about the Mary Carter --

12

MR. POPE:

Yes, sir.

13

QUESTION:

-- formula.

Would Florida hold the

14

agreement unenforceable if it were not secret, if the

15

agreement on its face said, we're going to pay X dollars

16

and we will agree to take the position that the other side

17

was primarily -- the other defendant was primarily

18

responsible?

19
20

MR. POPE:

As I understand it, that would be an

illegal agreement in Florida whether it - -

21

QUESTION:

So secrecy is not an element.

22

MR. POPE:

Secrecy has nothing --

23

QUESTION:

You just can't agree that your

24

position in the litigation will be X rather than Y.
MR. POPE:

Correct, and as I understand it, it

1

does not matter whether the agreement is secret or not

2

secret, the interest the court was trying to protect is

3

the integrity of the ongoing trial process, and parties

4

can settle -- great -- but apparently in Florida it was

5

becoming more of a problem than maybe it should have been.
We would go back to the Eleventh Circuit rule

6

7

and suggest to the Court that a settling tortfeasor who is

8

subject to the results of the trial and does not

9

participate in it would probably be disinclined most --

10

extremely disinclined to enter into any settlement

11

agreement with the plaintiff.

12

An additional disadvantage to the settling

13

tortfeasor is that he cannot close his books on this

14

casualty.

15

is ultimately resolved against the settling tortfeasor,

16

and if there is contribution, that's resolved.

He has to keep this matter open until the claim

17

In this very case, we may be looking at

18

procedures 3, 4, and 5 years in the future if the Eleventh

19

Circuit's ruling is upheld, given the State court appeals,

20

the possibility of a retrial in the State court, and then

21

perhaps a contribution action at some later date against

22

Boca Grande Club who, as a limitation plaintiff, the only

23

place that court -- that case could be heard would be in

24

the U.S. district court in Tampa, so we have that

situation.

1

I heard it mentioned in the earlier argument

2

that a full contribution or nonsettlement bar probably

3

would penalize a claimant,

4

settling defendant would probably insert into the

5

settlement agreement an indemnity provision or maybe

6

escrow some of the funds,

7

there's many ways it could be accomplished, but which

MR. POPE:

I agree, I think the plaintiff would

argue against, because it would want the benefits of joint

and several liability, but we are not here in this case to

21

question the applicability of joint and several liability

as to the parties that go forward with the litigation.

2

their respective proportionate degrees of fault, so we

3

think the rules still operate, but they should operate

4

only as to the nonsettling parties.
We would also point out that if a settling

5
6

tortfeasor really has limited assets, all the discussion

7

about contribution is somewhat meaningless, since the

8

contribution claim is going to be basically worthless

9

either.

If he wasn't interested in defending his position

10

and trying to get out cheaply on the initial claim, I

11

doubt seriously any contribution claim would cause any

12

great concern.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART C. MARKMAN

MR. MARKMAN:

may it please the Court:
By this rather advanced stage of these coupled

15

arguments, much has already said about the three possible

approaches that this Court could select.

1

approach adopted.

The first and foremost reason for this

2

position is one of simple fairness, and it's been

3

discussed and alluded to today.

4

The settlement bar rule tends to disrupt the

5

normal litigation incentives and the pattern of risks.

6

That is to say, the settlement bar rule creates an

7

incentive for the settling parties to saddle the

8

nonsettling defendant with an amount of liability or

9

culpability that far exceeds its true share.
The settling defendant is willing to settle at a

10
11

deep discount.

The settling plaintiff may be willing to

12

extend that deep discount because it knows, as a certainty

13

under the pro rata settlement bar rule, that any shortfall

14

or any bad bargain it entered into, has to be made up by

15

the nonsettling defendant.

16

The net result is that the nonsettling defendant

17

will bear the burden of a settlement to which it was not a

18

party.

19

liability in that setting will not be based on its true

20

fault or culpability.

21

outside-of-court, private deal made by parties and the

22

settling defendant was not a party to the agreement.

them to magnify the nonsettling defendant's fault.

that settlement bears, in that setting, to the nonsettling

defendant's actual fault.

As far as Florida Power is concerned, we will

be happy with either rule.

12

We will accept either

I'm assuming that in the event that this Court

13

doesn't opt for the proportionate credit approach, I'm

14

trying to highlight the unfairness of the settlement bar

15

rule in that setting, and I think part of the unfairness

16

comes out of this Court's own cases.

17

tell us -- for example, in the Cooper Stevedoring case,

18

this Court disapproves a rule that permits a plaintiff to

19

force the entire liability on one of two defendants even

20

if that defendant is equally -- that is, the settling

21

defendant is equally or more at fault.

23

discussed at length, this Court talked about principles of

fair fault allocation and the fact that those principles

should take precedence over quick but inequitable

settlements.
Now, it's also been discussed that the

2

3

settlement bar rule perhaps has one advantage in the pro

tanto setting over a contribution approach.

5

advantage that the proponents of the settlement bar rule

6

claim is that it is efficient.

7

follows:

8

initial settlement between the plaintiff and the first

The one

The argument runs as

it's efficient because it has promoted that

settlor, but in practice the rule is not efficient, and in
10

practice the rule really doesn't encourage the sort of

11

settlements that the courts want to encourage, the sort of

12

settlements that affect the true judicial economy.

13

In practice, the settlement bar rule and the pro

14

tanto setting frustrates complete settlements, and it will

15

only encourage that initial partial settlement.

16

reason is the reason I gave earlier.

17

in effect, serve as a war chest for the plaintiff.

The

The settlement can,

The plaintiff will be encouraged to litigate

18

against the nonsettling defendant because it knows that

20

whatever bargain it struck at the outset, the nonsettling

21

defendant will be required to make up the shortfall, the

22

discount.

save it from its own bad bargain, and what makes it

24

particularly unfair, thinking of Reliable Transfer and

25

Cooper Stevedoring, is that that will be the case even

though the settling defendant is far, far more culpable.

2

Of course, in this case the Court required, we

3

do not yet know the relative culpabilities of Florida

4

Power & Light vis-a-vis the Boca Grande Club.
Another efficiency that has been claimed on

5
6

behalf of the settlement bar rule as an advantage over

7

contribution has to do with ancillary litigation and the

8

good faith hearing requirement that we've heard discussed.

9

It is true that the contribution approach necessarily

10

definitionally involves a second proceeding, a

11

contribution action.

12

It is also true, however, and the settlement bar

13

rule's own proponents almost universally acknowledge this,

14

that if you're going to administer the settlement bar rule

15

in any sort of meaningful way, and in any way that would

16

detect, perhaps not collusion, that's been discussed, but

17

certainly patent unfairness, then the good faith hearing

18

itself to be efficacious is going to have to be akin to a

19

minitrial.

entail - -

1

A number of cases that have discussed good faith

2

hearings have said that if the good faith hearing is to be

3

truly efficacious and accomplish the result that's

4

intended, then it seems to me the issue the Court wants to

5

address there is one that's akin to a determination of

6

proportional fault.

7

The good faith of the settlement under a number

8

of cases that adopt the settlement bar rule, the good

9

faith of the settlement, will at least in part hinge on

10

the comparative liability of the parties, which speaks to

11

its inefficiency.

12

QUESTION:

Well, good faith, at least to the

13

uneducated, of whom I'm certainly one in this area, sounds

14

like -- you know, honest -- honest belief, or something

15

like that, but I gather from what you say it means some --

16

it isn't just to see if there was a fraud in the

17

settlement.

18

Something more than that is required.

MR. MARKMAN:

The -- that's the way the cases

19

read, as I read them, Your Honor.

20

even the proponents of the settlement bar rule and the

21

cases they cite, and the cases in the briefs in this

22

particular case, envision a much more probing inquiry, not

23

one that just looks at the settlement superficially to

24

determine solely if there's collusion or not, but one that

25

really looks at the merits of the action, and it seems

They have a more --

QUESTION:

would amount to collusion in the case of a settlement

MR. MARKMAN:

5

What

My understanding of the cases is

6

that -- and this may or may not sound like definitional

7

collusion.

8

unrelated to the merits of the action, the two parties

just decide that we're simply going to get the deep

My understanding of the cases is, wholly

11

going to be able to sue the deep pocket for the balance,

12

and you've got a guarantee that you're going to be able to

13

collect it.

Now --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MARKMAN:

Why is that collusive?
It may not be definitionally

16

collusive, Your Honor, but the same cases that speak to

17

the need of a good faith hearing use in tandem with the

18

discussion of collusion the necessity to assure that the

19

proceeding is fair.

In other words, to assure that the

Fair not just as between the

22

plaintiff and the settling defendant but fair also to the

and which undercuts the efficiency that's claimed by the

proponents of the settlement bar rule.

going to inquire as to global fairness, then you've got a

trial on the merits.
QUESTION:

5

If you're truly

Well, Mr. Markman, you -- don't

you -- don't most of the jurisdictions that use the pro

hearings?
MR. MARKMAN:
QUESTION:

10

They do, Your Honor.

Unless they adopt the variant of it,

11

where the nonsettling defendant can -- you know, can opt

12

one way or the other, but those that just employ a

13

straight pro rata, they also have a good faith hearing.

14

MR. MARKMAN:

15

QUESTION:

So - - and you're willing to accept

that disposition.

you in that context?

MR. MARKMAN:

maybe I didn't make my position clear.

against a pro rata rule that bars contribution suits even

our position that the good faith hearing, because of the

Your Honor, I am not aware of a

6

jurisdiction that has adopted a proportionate credit

approach coupled with a good faith hearing requirement,

and that is efficiency.

10

It seems, at least comparatively speaking,

11

unnecessary to impose that, and I guess the thinking is

12

the efficiency, and that is, the efficiency that comes

13

from the fact that the proportionate credit approach of

efficiency would be lost if there were an ancillary

As I said at the outset, we're trying -- the sort of

settlements that the settlement bar rule encourages are

the partial settlements that don't yield the judicial

efficiency.

6

They're the partial settlements that encourage a

prolongation of litigation anyway, and when you throw into

the mix that you've got to go back and try to make them

somewhat fair by imposing a good faith requirement and

10

having an additional proceeding, I don't think, on

11

balance, we discourage settlements.

12

If the deal struck is relatively fair, it seems

to me that a contribution action will be discouraged

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. MANN

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

4

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

5
6

7

MR. MANN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
A lot of the lengthy discussion that has gone on

8

this morning, I think it might be useful to step back for

9

a minute and emphasize a few points about the fundamental

10
11

principles relative to the cases before the Court today.
First, the Court's modern maritime cases

12

consistently have emphasized the virtues of a comparative

13

fault regime, because such a regime tends to allocate

14

responsibility in accordance with fault, and that in turn

15

tends to give all maritime actors an appropriate incentive

16

to avoid accidents.

17

I have urged would be consistent with that principle,

18

because each ultimately would result in solvent defendants

19

who do not settle being held liable for a share of the

20

total damages proportionate to their share of the fault.

21

Each of the rules that Mr. Kelley and

The second principle the Court has followed,

22

absent congressional intervention, is a principle of joint

23

and several liability, under which a plaintiff is entitled

24

to receive all of its damages from any single tortfeasor

25

so that the tortfeasors as a group bear the risk that one
39

1

or more of them are insolvent, or that one or more of them

2

may have some statutory defense to liability, as in

3

Edmonds.

4

Again, neither of the rules that we have urged

5

today would undercut that principle, except in cases where

6

the plaintiff voluntarily chooses to accept from a

7

defendant a sum less than that defendant's proportionate

8

sum of damages - - share of damages, and in that case we

9

see no inequity in holding the plaintiff to the burdens as

10
11

well as the benefits of the bargain.
Now, we suggest another principle that should

12

guide the Court in deciding the cases today.

A settlement

13

agreement between two parties should not have the effect

14

of altering the liability to the tort claimant of third

15

parties that are not a party to the settlement.

16

Now, the position urged by petitioners in this

17

case, adoption of a contribution bar, is the only one of

18

the three principal rules discussed in the briefs that

19

would lead to that anomalous result, and we submit that

20

the opportunities for collusion, together with the

21

alternate ways of resolving the problem, counsel against

22

adopting that rule.

23

Now, with respect to the question of collusion,

24

I thought it would be helpful if we explained what we see

25

as the type of collusion that courts are concerned about

version of the facts in the McDermott case, you can see

3

the problem.

4

I think that if you look at a simplified

You have a plaintiff who owns a boat.

A

5

subsidiary of the plaintiff --we can call it Hudson

6

Engineering -- designs a device for picking up a very

7

heavy object on the boat.

8

device doesn't work, the object falls, it causes a lot of

9

damage.

For one reason or another, the

10

made everything, the people who did everything, and then

QUESTION:

13

MR. MANN:

The plaintiff being the boat owner

14

sues everybody, as you would expect.

15

Now, one person who might have some liability is

16

the person who designed the sling that picked up the thing

17

and dropped it.

18

might have a very large share of the liability, but

19

because that person is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the

20

plaintiff, the plaintiff could enter into a settlement

21

agreement with that party under which that party pays

22

$100,000, even though you might think that the damages are

23

$10 million or $20 million.

24
25

Now, since that person is -- in fact they

the pro tanto approach, let's say you go to trial, the

nonsettling defendants, the parties that aren't related to

2

the plaintiff, there's a verdict for $10 million.

3

the contribution bar rule, the verdict is reduced by

4

$100,000 to take account of the settlement with the

5

related party and the plaintiff, and that leaves the

6

nonrelated parties paying $9,900,000 although the jury

7

might have found that they were responsible for, say,

8

50 percent of the accident.

9

that we think is unfair.
QUESTION:

10
11

Under

That's the type of collusion

But Mr. Mann, is that type of

collusion a problem if we do not adopt the pro tanto rule?
MR. MANN:

12

No.

If you adopt the proportionate

13

credit rule, you wouldn't have a problem with that at all,

14

and that's what I would go into -- it seems to us that in

15

choosing the two rules that Mr. Kelley advocated in the

16

first case and the rule that we advocate here, which we

17

advocate on the assumption that we lose the first case,

18

which -- is that the rule advocated by Mr. Kelley is a

19

simpler rule that reduces the need for collateral

20

litigation.
QUESTION:

21

Do you agree that if we adopt the

22

proportionate fault rule there's no need for good faith

23

hearings?

24
25

MR. MANN:

Yes.

I guess the most precise way to

refer to the rule that we've urged in the first case is
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

SUITE 400

1

the proportionate reduction rule, which refers to - -

2

QUESTION:

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. MANN:

Jesus, don't give us another version.

No, I think that it's useful to

5

explain.

The Court has -- I think the reason that people

6

try to call that rule the proportionate fault rule is

7

because your cases say that you like proportionate fault,

8

though Reliable Transfer case rejected the flat divided
damages rule in favor of what you can call a proportionate

10

or comparative fault regime, which says that everybody is

11

liable for their percentage of the damages.

12

The reason we call it proportionate reduction is

13

because you're reducing the plaintiff's claim

14

proportionately, and if you do adopt that rule in

15

McDermott, then it seems to us there would be no need for

16

a good faith hearing.

17

Now, the issue that Justice Souter and several

18

people were talking about towards the end of Mr. Markman's

1

argument, a Mary Carter agreement, that seems to us an

20

entirely separate question.

21

today I think have to do with how you account in the claim

22

for the effect of a settlement to one of the tortfeasors.

23

Now, there are separate common law rules, and I

The issues before the Court

24

would presume this Court would consider on the proper

25

occasion how to deal with a situation where a plaintiff in

(800) FOR DEPO

1

one of the tortfeasors enter into an agreement under which

2

the defendant -- the settling tortfeasor's going to assist

3

at trial.
In many States and many common law

4
5

jurisdictions, the rule is not that that agreement is

6

illegal, the rule is that it is supposed to be presented

7

to the fact-finder.

8

trial, the nonsettling defendant comes in and says, don't

9

believe what the settling defendant is saying, he's

It's discoverable, it's admissible at

10

getting paid to say that, don't listen to him, it's his

11

fault and not mine, and that is a separate rule, and the

12

Court as a matter of its maritime power under Article III

13

could consider adopting such a rule.
QUESTION:

14

So you're saying that the same

15

interest which leads courts under some circumstances to

16

outlaw Mary Carter in other circumstances would lead

17

simply to a mandatory disclosure rule, and therefore you

18

can adopt proportionate reduction without running the risk

19

of adding another collateral hearing to the enterpri -- to

20

the proceedings before they're done.
MR. MANN:

21

You certainly can do that.

I mean,

22

what I'd like to emphasize is, it's too entirely separate

23

questions.

You don't -- I don't think --

24

QUESTION:

Oh, I think we agree on the

25

separateness of the question.

We're just wondering if we

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

go down the road of proportionate reduction on the theory

2

that that is going to simplify proceedings, are we acting

3

on an assumption which is in fact true, because if we had

4

to -- if later on we found that the courts were saddling

5

the proportionate reduction rule with collateral

6

proceedings to look into good faith, we wouldn't have

7

gotten quite as much for our rule as we thought.

8

9

And I think you're answering that by saying the
interest that might lead you to worry, or a court to worry

10

about the terms of the settlement, does not necessarily

11

portend another collateral proceeding, it simply portends

12

a disclosure rule.

13

MR. MANN:

That's right.

I think we would

14

believe in all circumstances the best rule in these cases

15

would be to put the greatest amount of evidence before the

16

fact-finder, tell the fact-finder about the agreement -- I

17

mean, our system rests on the assumption, true or not,

18

that the fact-finder is going to make the right decision

19

after being presented with all the evidence, and I think

20

that really takes care of that problem.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Mann, what is the Government's

22

position on the variation of the proportional liability

23

rule that has been proposed?

24

MR. MANN:

25

I guess I'd like -- there seems

just -- there's two new rules.

They're not really new,

45

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

1

but two additional rules that weren't really discussed in

2

the briefs that have come up today.

3

refer to as the one-recovery rule, which is the rule that

4

you seem to advocate in the McDermott argument, under

5

which a settlement -- you would have a proportionate

6

reduction rule, except that in no circumstances would the

7

plaintiff be allowed to recover more than one recovery.
You asked if there was any system that adopted

8

9

The first of them I'd

that.

I think that if you look at subsection (3) of

10

section 885 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, there's

11

a suggestion to that effect, although it's not entirely

12

clear it would apply here, but that seems to adopt

13

something like that rule.

14

QUESTION:

But you don't favor that.

I know

15

your position on that, but before your time runs, just

16

tell me your position on the other one.

17

MR. MANN:

Okay.

Our position on the other one

18

is that we don't -- which is what I would refer to as the

19

election rule - -

20

QUESTION:

Right.

21

MR. MANN:

-- under which the nonsettling

22

defendant can choose between the pro rata and pro tanto

23

approaches, we don't favor that rule, either.

24

why we don't favor that rule first are that it seems to us

25

it would have an adverse effect on settlements, because
46

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

The reasons

1

it's going to take away from the plaintiff the incentive

2

to make a settlement, because if the plaintiff makes a

3

good settlement, he doesn't get the benefit of it, so it

4

certainly is going to decrease the plaintiff's incentive

5

for settlement.

6

A second problem with that rule with respect to

7

your concerns is that it doesn't necessarily get rid of

8

the one recovery problem that seems to concern you,

9

because at least as I understood the rule that was

10

proposed, the person would choose immediately after the

11

settlement was made whether they wanted pro rata or pro

12

tanto, so if he chose wrong, the plaintiff still might get

13

more than one recovery, and the third problem with it, it

14

seems to us --

15
16

17

QUESTION:

But at least you could say he got

what he deserved.
MR. MANN:

Well, that's our view of why we don't

18

like --we would disagree with the one recovery rule, is

19

that the plaintiff --we think the plaintiff gets what he

20

deserves, and we think that the nonsettling tortfeasor

21

pays what they deserve.

22

The last thing we wanted to say about that rule

23

also is it seems to us it's rather complicated, and you're

24

progressing down a road where you're making up increasing

25

levels of complicated exceptions.
