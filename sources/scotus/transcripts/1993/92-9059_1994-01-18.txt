ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID I. BRUCK

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. BRUCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this capital case is whether the

12

prosecution can secure a death sentence on the grounds of

13

the defendant's future dangerousness, while at the same

14

time concealing from the sentencing jury a crucial aspect

15

of its noncapital sentencing alternative, namely that life

16

imprisonment means life without parole.

17

Future dangerousness was the primary reason

18

advanced by the State in this case why the jury should

19

sentence Jonathan Simmons to death.

20

acknowledged that the petitioner, by reason of his serious

21

mental illness, was, in fact, dangerous or would be, in

22

fact, dangerous were he released back into society.

23

However, the defense showed, by expert and lay testimony,

24

a likelihood that the petitioner would make a nonviolent

25

and cooperative prison inmate.

The defense

Now, the jury itself identified the crucial

1

2

piece of missing information in this presentation.

3

90 minutes of deliberation on the issue of penalty, the

4

jury returned to the courtroom and asked the following

5

question:

6

with it the possibility of parole?

7

After

Does the imposition of a life sentence carry

And the trial judge responded by telling them

8

three things:

you are instructed not to consider parole;

9

that is not a proper issue for your consideration; and

10

life imprisonment and death sentence are to be understood

11

in their plain and ordinary meaning.
The issue in this case arises because of the

12

13

fact that under South Carolina law the correct answer to

14

the jury's question was no.

15

prior convictions for a violent offense, under South

16

Carolina law life meant exactly that, life without the

17

possibility of parole.

19

Because Jonathan Simmons had

The State, from the very beginning of the trial,

20

successfully impressed upon the trial judge not to tell

21

22

was going to be and the -- it was obvious what an

23

advantage the State would receive if alone among everybody

24

in the courtroom, the jury alone would be the only ones

25

not to know.

It was obvious how critical this information

QUESTION:

Mr. --

2

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bruck, are you arguing that

3

a State has an obligation to provide a truthful answer to

4

any question that a jury may ask?

5

MR. BRUCK:

No, not at all.

But here where

6

there is absolutely no justifiable, there is no rational

7

State interest in refusing to give the information that

8

the jury asked for and where the information on the facts

9

of this particular case was so crucial to a reliable and

10

fair determination of the sentence.
QUESTION:

11

Well, can a State say that we're not

12

going to answer jury questions that involve collateral

13

matters that are just going to distract the jury?

14

MR. BRUCK:

Certainly.

However, what the

15

alternative to death is in a case where the State is

16

basically saying -- not basically, where the State is

17

literally arguing to the jury this is a matter of self-

18

defense.

19

question before you is what to do with someone who is a

20

threat.

21

That was Mr. Harpootlian's jury argument.

The

He told the jury you -- the issue is not what

22

made him this way.

23

very extreme abuse and sexual abuse and violence in this

24

man's childhood.

25

before you is what to do with him now that he is in our

QUESTION:

impose sentences in noncapital cases?

4

MR. BRUCK:

5

QUESTION:

6

Do juries or judges in South Carolina

No, they do not.
Well, one must.

I asked do juries or

judges?

7

MR. BRUCK:

Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.

There is

8

no jury sentencing except in one or two -- no there is, I

9

believe, non whatsoever now.
QUESTION:

10

So supposing that in a noncapital

11

case a jury comes in with a question after some

12

deliberation and they want to know what the sentence is

13

for this offense if they find the person guilty, is a

14

State obligated to furnish that information?

15

MR. BRUCK:

Not by any means.

And the reason

16

for that is that the jury's task at the -- in the

17

hypothetical you put to me is to determine guilt or

18

innocence, without regard to what is going to happen.

19

in this case, in capital sentencing, the jury's task is to

20

sentence.

21

comfort from the principle that sentencing issues

22

shouldn't interfere with guilt in a proceeding which is a

23

sentencing hearing.

24

QUESTION:

information or a position about alternatives.

2

down to the position that the jury should know the meaning

3

of the terms, the meaning which the law gives to the terms

4

that the jury is required to use in pronouncing the

5

sentence.

Is that the nub of it?
MR. BRUCK:

6

It boils

Yes.

And most particularly our

7

Gardner claim, our due process claim, is that even if the

8

Eighth Amendment did not require an affirmative answer to

9

that question, where the State puts the meaning of the

10

noncapital sentencing so clearly into issue -- and we know

11

it was an issue not only because of the evidence and the

12

solicitor's -- the prosecutor's argument, but because of

3

the jury's question.

4

Court's Eighth Amendment jurisprudence to one side for a

5

moment, there obviously it just isn't fair.

6

QUESTION:

There surely -- leaving all this

2

MR. BRUCK:

3

QUESTION:

Um - Those are very relevant questions for

4

a jury that wants to know how severely this person is

5

going to be punished if the capital sentence is not

6

imposed.

7

think they're irrelevant at all.
MR. BRUCK:

8

9

Why are those questions irrelevant?

I don't

I don't think they have absolutely

no relevance, but I think it is within the broad range of

10

the State's ability, under cases such as Johnson v. Texas,

11

to channel and mold the jury's consideration of sentencing

12

factors.

QUESTION:

other ones can be excluded but this one can't.
MR. BRUCK:

No, that's correct.

Because this

think the retributive importance of this life without

there are degrees of relevance of extraneous information.

This isn't a question about extraneous information; it's a

QUESTION:

Well, do you argue simply that you're

entitled to the instruction if the jury asks?

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

No.
Is not the foundation of your

17

argument that the defense counsel is entitled to make this

18

argument to the jury if it chooses?
MR. BRUCK:

19

Absolutely.

And the trial judge, at

20

the prosecutor's urging, refused to allow precisely that

21

argument.

And you can see --

QUESTION:

Well, what --

MR. BRUCK:

Is that the working principle we

Well, turning to the Eighth

4

Amendment, the Skipper-Locket aspect, which this Court

5

need not reach, but if it were to reach that, I think the

6

language from Justice Powell's opinion in McCleskey, any

7

relevant circumstance which could cause the jury to fail

8

to -- to decline to impose the death penalty.

9

QUESTION:

Now --

So if a prosecutor wanted to put

10

in - - or, pardon me, a defense counsel wanted to put in a

11

videotape of what an execution looks like, he should be

12

able to do that so the jury could see the consequences of

13

what they're doing?

14

MR. BRUCK:

No.

Because I think given the fact

15

that the method of execution is constrained by the Eighth

16

Amendment and there is no torturous or cruel form of

17

execution permitted, I think it is within -- Lockett does

18

not remove the power of the State to say that that is not

relevant, and therefore it is not irrelevant circumstance.

20

But it is impossible to say that the fact that Jonathan

Simmons will not allow -- again, allow -- be allowed to be

paroled and to roam the streets is not a relevant

circumstance.

MR. BRUCK:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes.
How are we going to do that in the

confines of this case, other than make it parole specific?

4

MR. BRUCK:

Well, of course, this case is about

5

parole, and the Court need go no further than to say that

when the State has a -- has a dangerous mentally ill

MR. BRUCK:

QUESTION:

Well, is it an argument that the

the jury, or do you say that in every case the trial court

I don't know what it

is you're really asking us to hold.

MR. BRUCK:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BRUCK:

I'm asking -What's your request here?
I'm asking you to hold that where

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.
But does it require the judge to tell

That's correct.

1

the judge so ruled.

2

QUESTION:

So is there a constitutional

3

distinction that requires the judge be the one to say it,

4

or is your point that the term "life" must be defined --

5

you must be allowed to define it for the jury?

6

counsel does it or the court does it is not a

7

constitutional distinction.

9

MR. BRUCK:

It is the latter.

Whether

So long as the

defendant is able to have the jury informed, whether it be

10

by his counsel or by the court.

11

might not take counsel's word for it and might very well,

12

even had argument been allowed, come back with this

1

or that it is possible to establish a bright-line rule

2

which will clearly cover every conceivable fact situation.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but isn't it part of your

4

case -- now I don't know if -- there's some evidence in

5

the record, as I understand it, that without this

6

instruction the jury will be acting on a false premise.

7

MR. BRUCK:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

So your -- whatever your standard is,

it's limited to situations, as I understand it, where in
the absence of an instruction the jury will be mislead.

11

MR. BRUCK:

12

QUESTION:

13

Absolutely, absolutely.

Yes.
And mislead, as I understand it,

about the law.

14

MR. BRUCK:

15

QUESTION:

That's correct, about the meaning -You sometimes speak in terms of fact,

16

but what you want them told is what a legal term means

17

which they have got to use in sentencing.

18

MR. BRUCK:

19

QUESTION:

That is correct.
And some jurors may think it means

20

life subject to parole, other jurors may think it means

21

life without parole, and you want that legal definition

given to them.

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.
That's a perfectly rational thing for

a State to do, it seems to me.

16

that can't be done, because 35 years doesn't really mean

35 years if there's a parole system, or life does not

MR. BRUCK:

If that information is accurate,

think that that -- that under the -- I would be very

surprised if a State supreme court would allow that sort

of collateral trial, but I, frankly, have to say I don't

QUESTION:

that, Mr. Bruck?

14

but also your -- part of your touchstone, as I understand

your argument, is that in the absence of the instruction

the jury would be acting on a false premise.

The touchstone you say is reliability,

MR. BRUCK:

Yes.
Now, in the Chief Justice's example

it presumes, you know, one State prison in each State, and

presumably there's not much doubt about where the man's

going to go, so you wouldn't need the instruction.

14

the manifest dangerousness of this man's record and of his

mental illness; because of the prosecuted argument;

because of the fact that the defense was prevented from

making this crucial argument that you can protect society

And because, finally, lest there be the

slightest doubt, the jury not only came back and asked the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17
18
19

Very well, Mr. Bruck.

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, if it

please the Court:
It seems to me that the linchpin of Mr. Bruck's

20

argument, and the fiction that we need to examine, is that

21

throughout his argument to the lower court and his

22

presentation here today he equates the term "ineligibility

23

of parole" with "ineligibility of release."

24

came back and asked when would he be eligible for parole,

25

were they asking that limited, specific, technical term,

When the jury

or were they asking when will he be eligible to be

released?
QUESTION:

3

Why don't we assume that they were

4

asking what they asked, and they asked about eligibility

5

for parole?
MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

6

Well, Justice Souter, they may

7

have asked about eligibility for parole.

8

instruction by Mr. Bruck during trial was concluded with

9

the term that he will remain in jail for the rest of his

The requested

10

life.

In South Carolina while the Governor does not have

11

the power to pardon, the Pardon and Parole Board does.
QUESTION:

12

Well, maybe Mr. Bruck's suggested

13

instruction was inaccurate in that respect, but do you

14

take the position that the jury should not be told the

15

meaning of a term about which it has a legitimate

16

question?

17

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

I think the jury should be

18

told the meaning of the term.

19

QUESTION:

Well, do you think there's a

20

legitimate question possible in the minds of jurors, given

21

what most people know or think they know about the penal

system, as to whether or not the term "life" includes a

parole eligibility factor or whether it doesn't?

to me, based on what you've already said, is that the jury

In other words when they have to make

a choice between the death penalty and life imprisonment,

11

they don't need to know the meaning of life imprisonment?

14

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

Life imprisonment, for their

purposes, was defined as life imprisonment.

that was sufficient.

And yet this Court found

But I take it, then, that if we think

10

it's life imprisonment without parole?

QUESTION:

1

Well, wasn't the jury also told by

2

the use of a phrase that described the prisoner as being

3

"among us?"

I seem to recall that quotation somewhere in

4

the briefs.

Was that phrase used in describing him?

5

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

Yes, sir, in the context -- in

6

this context.

The argument was that the defense has

7

provided testimony to you that he was abused as a child,

8

that he underwent a number of difficulties as a child,

9

that he suffers from a series of stimuli, if you will,

10

over his young age that made him what he is today.

11

argument was that the question isn't how he got here.

12

He's here,- what do we do with him now that he is here

13

amongst us in our midst.

14

The

The question is is the enormity of the crime,

15

that is his personal characteristics, his record, his

16

personal characteristics, enough -- and I submit it was --

17

for him to be sentenced to the ultimate punishment of

18

death.

19

QUESTION:

Well, doesn't the description of him

as being amongst us suggest a different answer to Justice

Kennedy's question?

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

No, sir, I don't think so.

irrelevant unless it is assumed that he will at some point

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

Well, even if you were to

assume that he was parole eligible, as apparently the
assumption here is, that the jury assumed that, that

4

doesn't mean he's going to be paroled.

There is no

5

conclusion that he is going to be out.

Even if you

6

assume, that's a decision that will be made by someone --

7

again, the equation here is that -- not only that parole

8

ineligibility means he won't be released, but parole

9

eligibility means that he will.

10

QUESTION:

But, I thought you had conceded at

11

the outset in your answer to my first question that if the

12

prosecutor did make an argument about prevention of future

13

crimes, that counsel -- defense counsel could respond to

14

that?

15

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

That he could -- that if he

16

argued future crimes against society in general, yes, I

17

think so, but that wasn't done in this case.

18

QUESTION:

So if -- so if we disagree with you

19

in our interpretation of what the jury might fairly infer

20

from the prosecutor's argument, then we must reverse on

21

that basis?

22

MR. HARPOOTLIAN:

No, sir, again I would not

23

concede that reversal is necessary if you find that there

24

was some talk about future dangerousness beyond the penal

25

institutions.

I would suggest that, again, one -- you're

1

talking -- implying that due process is somehow violated

2

by the implication, if you will, of future dangerousness.

9

The judge's charge corrected any assumption that the jury
4

would have had that he posed a future danger to them.

5

don't -- he told them to disregard any terms about parole

6

or parole eligibility and to give the term "life

7

imprisonment" its natural -- its plain and ordinary

8

meaning.

9

I

So I would not concede that even had the

10

prosecutor argued that he's some danger, that that was

11

corrected by this instruction -- the primary instruction

12

by the court, which was --he used terms "life

13

imprisonment" and "death by electrocution" throughout his

14

charge, and then when the jury came back and asked about

15

the possibility of parole, to clarify that by saying

16

disregard it.

7

17

Just as if they have come back and asked about

18

some other impermissible area for their inquiry, the

19

burden of proof, or why the defendant didn't testify, a

20

number of other areas that this Court has found that

21

curative or cautionary instructions are very proper.

May I ask a question about the

My recollection may be wrong

correct that the law-enforcement community in the State

10

originally opposed life without possibility of parole

because they thought juries would then be inclined to give

that sentence rather than the death sentence; it might

reduce the number of death sentences.

saying that that they had not previously put the two
together.

acceptable.

MR. BRUCK:

Mr. Chief Justice, I rise only to

clarify a couple of factual items.

Mr. Harpootlian, no

doubt inadvertently, misdescribed the requested

instruction made by the defendant.

simply that the judge read the no parole statute to the

jury.

this case turns.

would you take the bitter with the sweet and concede that

17

it would be appropriate to read some more instructions to

18

the jury, some more statements of law to the jury, going

19

into questions -- the possibilities of furlough and work

20

release and so on?

21

At least to the extent that you asked for it,

MR. BRUCK:

Providing those are accurate, I

22

think under the Eighth Amendment, for purposes of this

morning, yes.

24

Court will necessarily allow these -- what are, in fact,

25

very speculative and remote possibilities.

I would simply direct the Court's attention to

pages 39 to 41 of our brief, that's footnotes 23 to 27,

21

which gives in some detail exactly what all of the

life-without-parole States have to say on this issue.

23

Finally, I would just note the issue -- the

history of this issue in South Carolina has been somewhat

25

torturous.

We describe it in our brief.

Shortly after

life without parole became an option for recidivist cases,
the State supreme court said that on the request of a
defendant restrictions on parole should be charged, and
that was the law until a month before this trial.
This is the first case to be tried under the new
regime of State v. Torrence which overruled that majority
practice and said that from now on the jury should be left
in the dark, and therefore I think it is at least
fortuitous that this practice is a novel one and can and
should, we submit, be nipped in the bid.
If there are no further questions, that's all we
have.
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Thank you, Mr. Bruck.

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:564 a.m., the case in the
above-entitled matter was submitted.)
