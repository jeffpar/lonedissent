ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case raises a question of statutory

12

construction.

13

Superfund statute, or CERCLA, authorizes the recovery of

14

attorneys' fees by private parties where they undertake

15

cleanup and then take steps to compel others-to

16

participate in the cost of the cleanup.

17

Key Tronic submits that the Federal

CERCLA section 107(a)(4) provides for the

18

recovery of response costs by parties.

19

"response" is defined in section 101(25) to include

20

enforcement activities.

21

liabilities and obligations of CERCLA on others by

22

undertaking cleanup and then compelling others to share in

23

the cost of cleanups, those actions constitute enforcement

24

activities within the meaning of the statute.

primary enforcement activity in the context of section

7

MR. SCHNEIDER:

9
10

Yes, Justice Souter, in this

case that has already occurred.
QUESTION:

11

And it may have -- indeed, have

12

occurred because of action commenced by non-Government

13

parties, but there's sort of an obvious reference to them

14

as enforcers in the citizens' suit provision, so it's not,

15

on the face of it, obvious that a person in the position

16

of your client is enforcing as opposed simply to spreading

17

the burden of liability.

18

MR. SCHNEIDER:

In the context of a Superfund,

party.

QUESTION:

MR. SCHNEIDER:

No, Justice Kennedy.

The only

10

relief available for a cost recovery plaintiff is to

11

recover costs that have been spent for cleanup.

12

definition, a cost recovery case under section 107

13

requires the plaintiff, whether it's the Government or a

14

private party, to undertake cleanup, to spend response

15

costs, and then bring an action to recover those costs.

16

QUESTION:

By

The Government's right to recover

17

attorneys' fees comes from still a different section,

18

doesn't it, under the legal studies section?

19

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, that's

20

correct.

Prior to the passage of the amendment of CERCLA

21

in 1986, the United States relied on section 104(b) as

22

well as section 107 to recover the costs of attorneys'

23

fees in bringing these types of actions.

24

amendment of Superfund in 1986, all of the lower courts

25

held that the Government was entitled to recover its fees

Key Tronic submits that if -- and the language

to authorize the award of attorneys' fees, then certainly

The reason that an enforcement activity includes

12

attorneys' fees is because the primary enforcement

activity within the meaning of section 101(25) and section

share of cleanup costs.

most logical reading of the phrase "enforcement

22

that will be undertaken not by attorneys.

No, that is not correct, Justice

Ginsburg.

the Court was construing section 4 of the Clayton Act, the

Court characterized a private action under section 4 of

the Clayton Act as a private enforcement action.

encourages private parties to act by awarding attorneys'

private attorney general or has been injured in fact and

15

is - - the actor is someone who is himself liable

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Off-hand, Justice Ginsburg,

I

16

cannot think of another example, but CERCLA is a unique

17

statute which uses the word "enforcement" in section

18

101(25) which is a definitional section.

19

It says,

for purposes of section 107,

in

20

defining the word "response," that word "response"

21

includes the words "enforcement activities."

22

that CERCLA is a unique statute is because in 1986, when

23

Congress amended the Superfund statute,

24

history was replete with references as to what an utter

25

failure the Superfund program had been.

The reason

the legislative

(800) FOR DEPO

The legislative

1

history contains many references explaining that EPA

2

simply was unable to make the Superfund program work by

3

itself.
The response, Congress decided to fix that

4
5

problem by giving more incentives to private parties to

6

act.

7

enabling private parties to recover their costs of

8

enforcement activities which we submit includes attorneys'

9

fees.

10

One of those incentives was in section 101(25),

The language of the statute is unlike virtually

11

any other statute, and this Court has recognized in the

12

Exxon decision that in fact it is an inartful statute, but

13

what Congress decided to do in Superfund was to make sure

14

that any party, whether it was a governmental party or a

15

private party, whether it was a liable party or a

16

nonliable party, any party that undertook cleanup could

17

then bring an action to recover its cost, and it used the

18

term "enforcement activity" in a section which expressly

19

applies to any party, liable or nonliable, governmental

20

party or private party.

21

QUESTION:

You want us to construe the term

22

under the policy of the amendments, which was to induce

23

private parties to act.

24

inducement to act under the circumstances that your client

25

acted unless that person has already been found liable and

1

otherwise, as Justice Scalia said, would have to pay the

2

whole tab, so that the public as a practical matter gets

3

nothing from the recovery that you want.
The problem has been identified, someone has

4
5

been made liable, and somebody's got to pay the bill, and

6

I don't see why Congress had any reason to induce this

7

action.

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Justice Souter, with all due

respect, in this particular case Key Tronic acted -- well,

10

Key Tronic has never been held liable.

12

discovered, but what Congress noted --

involved, 10 years before --

QUESTION:

I'll grant you that, but isn't it

18

fair to say that basically what your client was doing was

19

essentially what might be called a preemptive strike?

20

mean, ultimately, what it wanted to ensure was that it

21

would not end up paying the whole bill.

22

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Justice Souter, there's nothing

23

in the record which would support that statement, but

24

regardless of what happened in this particular --

We don't argue that it would

What Congress did, though, in 1986, was it

7

recognized there were not enough Key Tronics in the world

8

to make the Superfund process work.

9

noted that EPA had not done its job.

Congress in 1986
It was simply too

10

enormous a task to be undertaken by EPA alone, and this

Court recognized that in the Union Gas decision.

12

did not think it enough to give the tools only to EPA.

The question, Justice Souter, you raised as to

15

what does the public get as a result of this cleanup, what

16

the public gets is a clean site that might otherwise not

17

occur.

18

Congress had two goals when it passed the

19

Superfund statute.

One of the goals was prompt -- making

20

sure that hazardous waste sites were promptly cleaned up,

21

and the other goal was to make sure that those parties

22

that caused the contamination would pay for the

23

contamination costs that they had caused.

24

As a practical matter, Congress chose as its

25

mechanism to get to cleanup -- it chose to arm private

parties and the Government with extraordinary abilities to

Justice Souter, I am arguing

I mean, but isn't that sort of

what -- the point that you're making?

13

MR. SCHNEIDER:

14

QUESTION:

Well, it is --

The public does get something,

15

because it gets another pocket to go after if the first

16

one is not full enough.

17

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Absolutely, and the reason

18

Congress used the word "enforcement activities" and not

19

"attorneys' fees" is because the enforcement activities

20

could include the actions in this case, for example, where

21

a private investigator was hired to do the gumshoe work to

22

find out who disposed of hazardous substances at the

23

corporate landfill.

QUESTION:

or "respond" used anywhere else besides section 107(4)?

3

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Yes, Justice Scalia, it's used

in a number of other places within the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, I think your argument would be

4

a lot stronger if the only place in which the term

5

occurred was in this provision, because then that

6

specification that it includes enforcement activities

7

would have to be referring to this section, but if it

8

appears elsewhere, there might well be what Justice Souter

9

and I would call genuine enforcement activities, in

10
11

other

sections that are involved.
MR. SCHNEIDER:

The -- Justice Scalia, the

12

problem with that argument is that if Congress had wanted

13

only to give the right of attorneys' fees to EPA, it could

14

have done so by using the terms "enforcement activities"

15

in the section that applied only to EPA -- for example, in

16

section 104(b) -- but it didn't do that.

17

put the right to recover attorneys' fees or enforcement

18

activity costs in section 107(a)(4)(A), which applies only

19

to the Government, but it didn't do that.

20

It could have

In defining the term "response" -- in defining

21

the word "response," it put that definition in section

22

101(25), and section 101(25) defines the term "response"

23

as that term is used in section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA.

The enforcement activity under CERCLA is to make
sure that those parties that have caused contamination

That's

consistent with the common, every-day understanding of the

word "enforce."
In our brief, we have set forth the position

This Court's decision in the Alyeska case and in

the Union Gas case, both refer to the word "enforcement"

11

12

a practical matter, the use of the word "enforcement" in

That's section 101(25) of

the Superfund statute.
QUESTION:

10

Well, certainly the way the

12

"response" means "remove," "removal," "remedy," and

13

"remedial action."

14

MR. SCHNEIDER:

15

QUESTION:

That's --

Certainly you wouldn't think lawyers

16

were much good for cleaning up waste, or cleaning up a

17

mess.

18

MR. SCHNEIDER:

That's correct, and we expressly

19

rely on the new language which was added, the words

20

"enforcement activities."

21

in order to establish that Congress intended both the

22

Government and private parties to recover fees.

23

QUESTION:

That's the language we rely on

So that "respond" and "response" and

24

"remove" now mean -- now include enforcement activities

relating to removal or remedies.

MR. SCHNEIDER:

That is correct, Mr. Chief

Justice, and in this case an action to reallocate cost

It's

Well, that's rather attenuated, isn't

it?
MR. SCHNEIDER:

Well, Congress used the word

"related," which is a very broad word, Mr. Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

Well, it -- it's a word that could

10

have a broad meaning or it could have a narrow meaning,

11

depending on how one defines it.

12

just spring to one's thoughts immediately that there's

13

that connection that you say.

14

MR. SCHNEIDER:

Certainly it doesn't

Mr. Chief Justice, Congress used

15

the word "related" in the common, ordinary use of the term

16

"related," meaning does it pertain to, does it relate to

17

an action to reallocate cost of cleanup, does it relate to

18

the cleanup.

19

But there's a second argument that we raise, and

20

that is, actions to reallocate costs among liable parties

21

will directly lead to cleanup, and the reason it will lead

22

to cleanup, Mr. Chief Justice, is because if private

23

parties know that they can undertake cleanup, spend the

24

money, spend far more than their fair share of the cleanup

25

costs, and then get a portion of those costs and

1

attorneys' fees back from other parties, they are far more

2

likely in the first place to undertake cleanup.

3

And so the use of the word "related" we submit

4

has a very broad meaning, but even if one used a very

5

narrow meaning, Congress decided that the mechanism to get

6

to cleanup was to allow private parties as well as the

7

Government to enforce the statute.

8

9

If I could respond to the question of Justice
Souter, the United States argues that enforcement

10

activities is something that only the EPA can conduct, but

11

nothing in the statute or the structure or the language of

12

the statute supports that argument.

13

provides that any party, whether it's a governmental party

14

or a private party, may undertake response action, and as

15

this Court noted in the Union Gas decision, EPA cannot

address all of the sites across the country.

Did Key Tronic itself arrange to have

any of the cleanup done?

MR. SCHNEIDER:

phases of cleanup, Mr. Chief Justice.

In the early

phases, before the EPA got involved, Key Tronic did the

environmental investigation, it provided bottled water, it

8

provided a new water main so that residents living near

the landfill would not be exposed to that.
They also did, as I understand it, some

excavation measures, but the real long-term cleanup

occurred once the -- after Key Tronic prepared the consent

decree which set forth the remedy in the case, that as the

long-term cleanup, and the long-term cleanup, and it's

going on today, is to pump the groundwater out of the

Nonetheless, there has been a course

But to get back to this case, petitioner has

11

to -- in order for its view to prevail, it has to have two

inferences -- not just one of the two, but both of them

drawn in petitioner's favor.

14

that enforcement activities standing alone, without the

support, such as it is, of this reference, at least, to

2

jointly and severally liable and who tend to be relatively

3

strong litigants and relatively well-to-do, can seek

4

contribution from a large number of other potentially

5

responsible parties who may be much smaller contributors

to the site.

7

And there tends to be a considerable disparity

8

of bargaining power between the litigants in these

9

contribution actions to begin with, because the ones who

10

are going to become the plaintiffs were selected because

11

of their ability clean up the site in the first place.

12

And that disparity in bargaining power can be considerably

13

exacerbated in some cases if there is also the potential

14

liability for attorneys' fees.

15

I'm not saying that Congress had this in mind

16

and made a conscious decision to bar recovery of

attorneys' fees in the contribution litigation, but I'm

pointing out that Congress was aware of these underlying

Mr. Wallace, you acknowledged a bit

earlier that it's unusual, if not, indeed, unique, for the

1

provision itself says that it will be governed -- that

2

contribution will be governed by Federal law, and the

3

Federal common law rule is the rule of Alyeska and of

4

Runyon against McCrary, that in the absence of explicit

5

authorization there should be no recovery of attorneys'

6

fees.

7

Now, I don't think that it is for the Court in

8

this case to resolve whether it would be more desirable or

9

less desirable for attorneys' fees recoveries to be

10

available in contribution actions, and I don't think that

11

Congress decided to bar the recovery of attorneys' fees.

12

What I do think is that the line that we see between

13

actions that are taken to remedy the pollution and assure

14

that a polluter -- rather than the public -- who is

15

jointly and severally liable will bear the cost -- the

16

line between that and reallocating costs among polluters

17

is a very rational line.

18

And it is rational in terms of considerations

19

the Congress was aware of in the course of considering

20

this legislation, and I want to just refer very briefly to

21

a couple of indications of that.

22

Congress explicitly resolved it, because -- but because I

23

think it shows the wisdom of applying the Alyeska rule

24

here, that Congress could have rationally not wanted to

25

proceed that far.

Not because I say that

And one is in the Senate committee report which

2

accompanied the 1986 amendments, and the committee says

3

that responsible sites often involve dozens or even

4

hundreds of potentially responsible parties with differing

5

types and degrees of involvement with the release.

6

the Government may sue all potentially responsibilities,

7

it need not sue all these parties; it may instead sue a

limited number of parties to secure a complete cleanup or

on the floor of the Senate, Senator Simpson, who was a

3

member of the conference committee, pointed out to his

4

colleagues:

5

"There is not doubt that the immense transaction

6

costs generated under Superfund, meaning lawyers' fees and

7

the many technical and scientific studies required in

8

litigation, have come to symbolize the worst excesses of

9

the American legal system.

Senator Domenici quoted

10

Dickens' Bleak House in describing it last year, and he

11

was right.

12

resources spent on necessary and effective cleanup of

13

Superfund sites and less on convoluted litigation which

14

merely extends any public health threat that exists from

15

these sites."

16

We simply must work to have more societal

There are plausible reasons why Congress might

17

have wanted to draw the line that we think emerges on the

18

face of the statute, and reasons why there might have been

19

concern that settlements that might be encouraged were

20

attorneys' fees available in the contribution phase of the

21

litigation, might sometimes be in terrorem settlements

22

rather than something that would move the litigation along

in a fair and just manner.

all you get under citizens -- it's the only -- there's

13

nothing --no other category that this can be placed

under, as distinguished from the cleanup recovery.

15

MR. WALLACE:

It still is a rather striking

16

difference in statutory drafting, and this provision was

17

added at the same time in the 1986 amendments that the

18

reference to enforcement activities was added, which

19

certainly makes no explicitly reference to attorneys'

attorneys' fees provision.
