ORAL ARGUMENT OF WAYNE S. BISHOP

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BISHOP:

11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This is a case of Federal jurisdiction.

To be

12

precise, the question is whether a Federal district court

13

has jurisdiction to hear a preenforcement challenge of a

14

substantive regulation issued by the Mine Safety & Health

15

Administration.

16

case was decided below on a decision by Federal district

17

court issuing a preliminary injunction.

18

Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed on the

19

jurisdictional grounds.

The case is not here on the merits.

case is about is essential to understand the basis of this

Administration that deprived the mine operator of its

right to exclude nonemployee union organizers from its

2

premises.

The decision of the Mine Safety & Health

4

Administration in this respect is a regulatory decision.

5

It was an interpretation of a regulation issued by MSHA

6

several years before.

applied to petitioner.

8

petitioner had to deal with the issue.

The case was -- or the decision was
This is the first opportunity the

The question here before this Court is whether

10

this regulatory interpretation is properly reviewable in a

11

Federal district court on a preenforcement challenge.

12

QUESTION:

Are you saying there's no way they

13

could have challenged this regulation prior to the

14

proposed enforcement action?

15

MR. BISHOP:

That's right, Justice Souter.

The

16

precise issue here was not decided in the original

17

regulation.

18

precise issue here of whether a nonemployee union

19

organizer could be designated as a miner's representative

20

under the act was not part of that regulation.

21

22

23

The original regulation was a broad.

QUESTION:

The

Then, are they in fact challenging

the regulation?
MR. BISHOP:

It is a direct challenge to the

24

regulation, but to the interpretation of the regulation

25

rather than the regulation as it issued at the time.

MR. BISHOP:

What is it in this case?
It is the -- the designation was

20

organizers who are not employees of the mine, so it's a

22

dual designation, both the union and the professional

MR. BISHOP:

Unfortunately, the Mine Act is not

clear on that, Your Honor, and the --

4

QUESTION:

It seems a little incongruous to me.

5

I thought it had to be an individual walking around with

6

the Federal inspector.

7

MR. BISHOP:

That is the practical effect of it,

8

but the designation was approved by the Mine Safety &

9

Health Administration as the designation of the union and

10

its professional employees.
QUESTION:

11

And that would mean any officer of

Any union representative could perform the

I didn't get that out of the papers,

In your view, it would not make a

difference if it had been only the two individuals who are

2

the risk of having a citation issued?

3

MR. BISHOP:

4

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And then you could have asked for a

5

review by the Commission, which would have gone to an

6

administrative law judge?

7

MR. BISHOP:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That's correct, Your Honor.
And at that time, do you acknowledge

that you could have raised the same issue about the
validity of the regulation?
MR. BISHOP:

11

It is -- that is a procedure that

12

is available under the act, too, is a procedure that the

13

mine operator here chose not to take for very special

14

reasons.

15

QUESTION:

But it's your position that

16

notwithstanding the availability of that scheme, within

17

which -- the framework of which you could have raised the

18

challenge, that you can go direct to district court --

19

MR. BISHOP:

20

QUESTION:

21

22

That's correct, Justice O'Connor.
-- and challenge the validity of the

regulation?
MR. BISHOP:

We believe that the statute

23

provides that opportunity, and this Court's decision in

24

Abbott Laboratories provides the basis for that approach.

challenge to the regulation was a challenge to an

2

inevitable interpretation of the regulation.

3

doubt that that regulation would have to be interpreted to

4

prevent what the company said could not lawfully be

5

prevented.

6

In your case, as you've acknowledged, the

7

regulation need not be interpreted that way.

8

have been interpreted ultimately differently.

MR. BISHOP:

It might

And we think it should have been

interpreted differently.
QUESTION:

Well, so you should have waited your

12

turn to assert that.

13

Abbott Labs is concerned.

Abbott Labs.

15

There was no

MR. BISHOP:

I don't know how you can invoke

Well, I don't --my understanding

16

of Abbott Labs is it does not restrict to a choice of a

17

regulation that was not subject to multiple

18

interpretations.

QUESTION:

Abbott Labs was part of a trilogy,

and it seems to me that your case comes closest to the

Toilet Goods decision.

1

where preenforcement challenges were allowed, were allowed

2

on the basis of ripeness, which I think is the point that

3

we're getting to here, and in the Toilet Goods v. Gardner

4

case, the Court found the case was not ripe yet.

5

reason was in the application of the regulations.

The

6

In the two cases, Abbott and the other Toilet

7

Goods situation, the application of that reg caused the

8

companies to have to undergo a change in business

9

practices.

They had to do things immediately.

In

10

addition to that, the failure to follow the suggested

11

compliance approach would subject them to penalties both

12

civil and criminal, and the Court found in those two

13

circumstances that this was sufficient ripeness for the

14

action to happen.

15

Under the Toilet Goods -- Gardner v. Toilet

16

Goods case, the Court found that the application of the

17

regulations there were more general.

18

they did not require immediate action.

19

were phrased in the turn of the language, "may," rather

20

than "shall."

21

22

it was not ripe, while the other two cases were.

They were not -The regulations

The application was not felt by the

In our situation, this was a very ripe decision.

QUESTION:

But nothing is happening immediately.

All that's happening is you're posting two names, or maybe

MR. BISHOP:

2

Well, that's the first thing that

happens.

4

people then have access to records of the mine that they

5

would not have access to before.

participate in mine inspection.

7

What happens after that is, those two names of

QUESTION:

They have the ability to

I thought that the administrator said

8

that there would be very circumscribed availability of the

9

records, that they would not be available for any and all

10
11

purposes but only for this safety purpose.
MR. BISHOP:

Even if the records are available

12

for safety purposes, Justice Ginsburg, it causes a major

13

change to the --

14

QUESTION:

But you're speculating on a lot of

15

what may be, as distinguished from the Gardner -- Abbott

16

Laboratories, where there wasn't any question about what

17

was going to happen.

18

MR. BISHOP:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

19

it's speculation.

I think it's real life.

These people

20

as designated representative miners, would have the

21

opportunity that they do not have under the National Labor

22

Relations Act in two respects.

23

Relations Act for more than 40 years has had two major

24

principles, 1) -- it has many principles, but two that

relate here:

union organizers can be excluded from the premises except

for very unusual circumstances not presented here.
Second, the National Labor Relations Act says a

MSHA or before the review -QUESTION:

12

But that's exactly the position you

13

could argue ultimately before the Commission, as has

14

happened in other cases, I understand it has gone that

15

route.

16

MR. BISHOP:

We could have, and the reason we

17

didn't, Your Honor, is because we were subject to the

18

potential of losing the very right that we wanted to

19

protect, and that was because, in a case that occurred,

20

the neighboring mine to Thunder Basin, just 2 months

21

before, MSHA approached the failure to post the

22

designation and said, we will issue a citation, and we

23

will fine you maximum daily penalties -- at that time

24

$1,000 a day, now $5,000 a day -- if you do not post it.

whether you have -- all the dire consequences that you

predicted had occurred in that other case.

MR. BISHOP:

with something more than monetary cost.

We're dealing

25

with a very important cost to Thunder Basin, and that is

the cost of having to abandon a very important right.

2

This company has the right under the labor laws as

3

interpreted by this -QUESTION:

4

Mr. Bishop, can I interrupt, because

5

it's through your brief, now, the right to exclude a

6

stranger from your property is basically a State law

7

right, isn't it?

8

MR. BISHOP:

QUESTION:

It's a common law -There's nothing in the National Labor

10

Relations Act that gave you that right.

11

authorize trumping that right.
MR. BISHOP:

12

13

QUESTION:

So if there had never been a National

Labor Relations Act, you'd have exactly the same right.

MR. BISHOP:

17

QUESTION:

18

It's a common law property right,

and in some cases a State --

14
15

It merely didn't

That's correct, Your Honor.
So you're not relying on a Federal

statutory right.

19

MR. BISHOP:

Well, we think we are.

It's not a

20

right that has been written in an act of Congress.

However, over the 40 years that this issue has been

debated legally and in Congress, it has always been

upheld.

1

underlying right of the owner is from State property law,

2

as Justice Stevens said.
MR. BISHOP:

3

It certainly is, but four times

4

this Court, that I can recall, and I think there were

5

other cases, has discussed this employer's right in the

6

context of the full reach of the National Labor Relations

7

Act, and it has declined and refused to allow the other

8

interests under the labor laws to cause diminution of that

9

right.

10

It is now very much a part of the fabric of the

labor laws.
QUESTION:

11

The source of the right is State law.

12

The National Labor Relations Act deals with the worker's

13

right, and it doesn't give them a right to go as far as to

14

override the property owner's right.

15

attribute the property owner's right to the national labor

16

laws.

17

MR. BISHOP:

I don't see how you

Your Honor, I think after the many

18

cases that that this Court has looked at that right, and

19

looked at the many opportunities and arguments to weaken

20

that right because of other advantages or opportunities or

21

necessities created under the labor laws, that this right

22

now is a recognized part of the full rights under the

23

labor laws.

When a Federal law respects a right

It becomes part of the statutory

scheme.

here --

If it's not part of the congressional law, it is

QUESTION:

What we're talking about

Any time the Federal law doesn't

7

encroach on the State law domain, that State law then

8

becomes Federal law.

9

MR. BISHOP:

10

draw it that starkly.

11

QUESTION:

That's the position you're taking.
No, Your Honor, I don't mean to

Well then, how does what is a State

12

property law become a Federal law when all the Federal law

13

does is says that the worker's right that this Federal law

14

deals with doesn't go as far as to override the State's

15

property --

16

MR. BISHOP:

The only answer I can give to that,

17

Your Honor, is that it becomes part of the framework and

18

the fabric of the statutory scheme.

19

20

Court has affirmed that on four recent occasions, and all

for review that -- would you be claiming the right to

4

MR. BISHOP:

The issue here

is the validity of the right to exclude --

5
6

I don't think so.

QUESTION:

So the $5,000 a day essentially is

not your argument, is it?

7

MR. BISHOP:

Well, no, it is.

What I mean by my

8

response, Justice Souter, is this.

If it were not for the

9

existence of the right to exclude union organizers --

10

nonemployee organizers -- from the premises, the company's

11

situation would have been that the abatement cost were

12

very small, and it would not have been faced with the

13

daily penalty.

14

In other words, it would have litigated the

15

issue before the Review Commission, but the cost of having

16

to give up its right to exclude the union organizers is

17

the major cost here.

company to fight, to go to seek preenforcement challenge

19

in court.

20

QUESTION:

That is the cost that causes the

Well, you don't take the position

21

that every time you want to challenge an administrative

22

interpretation and there is a running daily cost against

23

it, that therefore a corporation such as yours should in

effect have the nonspecifically statutory review

opportunity that you're seeking.

broad position, do you?
MR. BISHOP:

2

3

We don't think the damages or the

cost would be sufficiently great to justify it.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Bishop, let me come back to your

contention that unlike Toilet Goods, this case does not

MR. BISHOP:

Not that they would engage in

organizing activities, but that the potential was high,

and the opportunity was presented for them to do that.

Does that mean, like, talking to the

miners and sort of propagandizing the union, or just

finding out facts that will be useful in later -- I'm a

little puzzled about --

of Government authority placed on the Mineworkers Union by

being allowed into the plant with the Federal Government,

that's a substantial impact on the will of the voter if it

Under your view, would it have been

particular its inspection provisions, and upheld their

constitutionality against a Fourth Amendment challenge

required for the periodic inspections prescribed by this

7

And in deciding that this was permissible for

Congress in treating this industry under this statutory

legislative structure of the act is highly relevant to

analysis of that structure and the congressional purposes

as they relate to this case.

7

QUESTION:

You're picking up on a case that's

8

cited, as far as I can see, only at the bottom of footnote

MR. WALLACE:

10

Well, it is the one case in this

11

Court that dealt with this act, and I'm just using it as a

12

starting point for our explanation of what Congress was

13

doing in revising the remedial provisions from the pre­

14

existing ones, because they was a considerable structural

15

change made in the penalty provisions, and this was based

16

on concerns about -- as the preamble of the act said, that

this Court pointed to in Donovan v. Dewey, and we've

mines.

2

Part of what Congress did in this legislation

3

was to, for basically the same reasons, replace what it

4

found to be cumbersome, repetitious, and ineffective

5

enforcement mechanisms in the prior law which it

6

complained in the committee reports were allowing

7

protracted litigation while the conditions that were cited

8

by the Secretary of Interior, who was administering at

9

that time, went uncorrected, and it replaced this with a

10

restructured and streamlined enforcement scheme that is

11

the scheme at issue here, and it created the Federal Mine

12

Safety Commission, a new agency independent of the

13

Department of Labor, to hear complaints, and for the first

14

time it included a system of daily penalties that could be

15

imposed for failure to abate a violation after the

16

violation has been cited.

17

The whole structure and purpose reflected in the

18

legislative history that we cite and that the Court itself

19

cited in Donovan v. Dewey in footnote 7, referring to the

20

pertinent Senate and House reports, was to tilt the

21

balance away from the direction of protracted litigation

22

while the violation remained uncorrected toward a system

23

that would provide incentives to correct the violation and

24

protect the health and safety of the miners and then do

25

the litigating.

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

5
6

But the question --

It's just the nomination of certain

individuals instead of others as inspectors.
MR. WALLACE:

The question in the case goes to

7

the way this scheme will work and whether preenforcement

8

preemptive strikes, as the court of appeals called them,

9

can be brought in the district court to interfere with the

10

statutory process for abating any violation that has been

11

cited by the inspector.

12

So we must look, in determining how the act

13

should work, beyond the narrow confines of this case, and

14

I don't want to belittle the fact that Congress did think

15

for these inspections to be effective that the miners

16

should have a right to have a representative of their own

17

accompanying the inspector, perhaps pointing out things to

18

the inspector that the inspector would otherwise not have

19

brought to his attention.

20

A representative of the employer also

21

accompanies the inspector, so the employer's

22

representative is present along with the miner's

23

representative every step of the way and is there to see

24

to it that the miner's representative does not overstep

reason why, in the designation which appears at pages 29

and 30 of the Joint Appendix, the miners who designated

12

these two men to be their representatives designated

13

themselves, or some of themselves, as the alternates in

An official of the

Department of Labor advised the petitioner that these

Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bishop told us that

there are quarterly inspections, so that there would be
periodically inspections, and he also said that with
respect to finality the interpretation of the regulation

The adjudication of the validity of that

regulation is something else, but why is that any less
final than, say, a change in the Federal rules that's put
in the rule books but that hasn't been tested in an
adjudication?

district director of the MSHA will not necessarily prevail

that are channeled in the act for litigating it.

13

Then the inspector can, if more

an equal number of representatives of the employer, so if

It happens that in this instance it was only the

probably would not take more than 2 or 3 days, I'm told,

4

whereas an underground mine could take a month or two, if

it's a large facility, there are many problems there of

QUESTION:

Even in a

Mr. Wallace, the -- you said in the

8

brief there's an explicit designation of the court of

appeals as having exclusive jurisdiction.

10

curious phrase that the statute uses.

11

It's rather a

and then it says,

MR. WALLACE:

20

Well, I think that is to assure

21

that the review will proceed in only one court of appeals

22

and not in the D.C. circuit and also in the regional

23

circuit.

24
25

That is what is -QUESTION:

Well, there's, I guess, various

explanations for the phrase.

It indicates that -- but

it's rather odd to use the phrase,

"upon such filing."

In

section 1331 we don't say, upon filing there should be
jurisdiction, because obviously there can't be any
jurisdiction until something's filed.
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

I think --

But it's certainly not the way

Congress usually acts when it purports to give exclusive
jurisdiction to a particular court or set of courts.
MR. WALLACE:

I think it's to be read in

conjunction with the fact that the jurisdiction is
initially conferred for review either in the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or in the
regional court of appeals, but upon filing in one of those
courts, then that court's jurisdiction becomes exclusive.
Before that, it would have been concurrent with the other
court.
I really think that it's just in the context of
that that Congress used this expression, and it's upon the
filing in one of the courts that that court becomes the
one with the exclusive authority in that case, so that
there won't be duplication of proceedings.
QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, the regulations, the

underlying regulations here, when they were promulgated,
there could have been a facial challenge to the
regulations.

There wouldn't have been any finality issue

1

at that point, would there?
MR. WALLACE:

2

Well, I think that is correct, and

3

certainly to the extent that the regulations are

4

legislative in nature.

5

There is in this act a provision that we refer

6

to in some detail on page 2 of our brief, section 811 of

7

the act, which is not one of the provisions set forth in

8

the appendix, but which is of some significance here in

9

illuminating the kinds of challenges to regulations that

10

are normally authorized.

11

that the Secretary by rule shall develop and promulgate

12

improved mandatory health or safety standards for the

13

protection of life and prevention of injuries in coal or

14

other mines.

15

This is a provision that says

It's a big legislative rule-making

16

responsibility that has been placed on the Secretary, and

17

there is a subsection (d) there that provides for judicial

18

review of any of those rules by any person who may be

19

adversely affected by one of these new substantive rules.

20

He may at any time within 60 days of its adoption file a

21

petition challenging the validity of that mandatory

22

standard.

QUESTION:

But your position is that an

interpretation of those regulations -- those regulations

whatever, 60 days, then the administrator interprets one

2

of those regulations.

3

doesn't become final until there's an adjudication of the

4

correctness of the interpretation?

That, you say, the interpretation

MR. WALLACE:

5

Well, that's correct.

That would

6

be a disputed issue, and the method of disputing it is

7

channeled by the statute, and we say that it was designed

8

to be an exclusive method and to eliminate the district

9

court's suits that had been such a problem under the pre­

10

existing scheme, in which -QUESTION:

11

But that's a different argument from

finality.

14

thing, and even though it's final, it may be that the

15

scheme of the statute shows that it is not yet

16

challengeable.

17

Justice Ginsburg asked you, you know, whether

MR. WALLACE:

It seems to me finality is one

That is correct.

It is a

18

different argument, and our primary argument in the case

19

is that the statute set up an exclusive method for

20

handling of these disputes through an orderly,

21

administrative process, followed by review in the courts

22

of appeals and a centralized agency that would be acting

23

with expertise.

that an employee of the union could not be designated as a

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bishop concedes that

6

he could have gone that way, that his client could have

7

chosen that route, but I think his point is that there is

8

in this regime no counterpart to, say, 405(g) and (h) of

9

the Social Security legislation.

10

There is nothing that

says, and this is the only way.
MR. WALLACE:

11

There's nothing explicit that

12

precludes other remedies, but of course, that was true in

13

the Block case, and in Whitney Bank, and in many other

14

cases.

15

our brief but which I brought to Mr. Bishop's attention

16

yesterday, in which the court has held that detailed

17

remedies in a district court under a particular statute,

18

even though they don't in terms oust other possible

19

remedies, should sometimes be interpreted to be the

20

exclusive remedy provided for the particular kind of

21

complaint being made.

court to challenge the regulation after it's applied to
you.

Nonetheless, we allowed an exception from that

normal scheme because of the severe hardship in that case.
Are you saying never?
MR. WALLACE:
QUESTION:

It wasn't --

Are you saying never here, or are you

saying that hardship isn't enough?
MR. WALLACE:

Well, I -- what I think I'm

saying, or if -- is that hardship is not the sole
criterion.
What I'm suggesting about the Abbott Labs
trilogy is that while there is no crisp distinction about
when a preenforcement review has been recognized, a good
deal of light is shed on that by the distinction that does
exist in administrative law between legislative
regulations in which new substantive standards are being
imposed that affect primary conduct, and that is what the
Court talked about in Abbott Labs, that primary conduct
was being affected by what the agency did in that case.
And in the companion case that was held to be
ripe for review, Gardner v. Toilet Goods, the Court
referred to what the agency had done as amplifying the
statutory standard imposing new standards that will affect
the primary conduct of the people who brought the
challenge, whereas interpretations, or even interpretive

2

about the meaning of the statute that someone can

3

litigate.

4

Now, typically, when there are provisions for

5

review of the validity of the new legislative regulations,

6

they have to be brought quite promptly.

5

I can't point to a case in which one has been

what's involved in this case is the kind of preemptive

8

strike that could undo the whole statutory scheme, because

9

any case before a citation is issued could be diverted

10

into district court on a very similar rationale.
As the court of appeals in this case pointed

out, it often can be said that there are other statutory

agency, and then is to be determined independently by the
