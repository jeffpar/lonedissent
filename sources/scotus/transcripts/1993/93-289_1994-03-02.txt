ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We'll hear argument

GENERAL DAYS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On November 5th, 1990, the President signed into

11

law the Defense Base Closure Act at issue in this

12

litigation.

13

efforts on the part of both the Congress and the President

14

to remove partisan and procedural obstacles that

15

historically had made it nearly impossible to achieve a

16

timely and orderly close of domestic military bases deemed

17

unnecessary to the national security.

18

The 1990 Act was the product of vigorous

The compromise arrived at by the legislative and

19

executive branches with respect to this particular issue

20

embodied several critical features.

21

was to be held personally responsible for the decision.

22

Secondly, there would be extensive congressional oversight

23

and involvement.

24

commission established to make recommendations to the

25

President, and there would be a single indivisible package

First, the President

Third, there would be an independent

1

made available to the President by the Commission.

2

The entire process would be one that would be

3

completed within a 6-month period.

4

process was that it would remove concern for what was

5

referred to as cherry-picking.

6

contributed to the criticism of the pre-1990 base closure

7

actions and impasses between the Congress and the

8

President, where on a base closing list one particular

base would be picked

That is a practice that

out and removed from that particular

determination.

11

Between April 15th and July 30th, 1991, as --

12

insofar as this lawsuit is concerned, every party had

13

completed what was required of that party under the 1990

14

Act.

15

for base closures and realignments, and the Commission had

16

held hearings on 82 closures or realignments.

17

President had approved the entire list and transmitted it

18

to Congress, and Congress, having held hearings on that

19

particular list, had declined to enact a Joint Resolution

20

of Disapproval.

21

The Secretary of Defense had made his recommendation

GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct.

That's central

to the scheme.
QUESTION:

All right.

Does the President have

4

any obligation to review the proceedings below for

5

irregularity?

6

GENERAL DAYS:

7

QUESTION:

He does not.

There's nothing - -

Could the President do that?

Could

8

he decide that there were irregularities in the process

9

and therefore he wouldn't approve?

10

GENERAL DAYS:

There is nothing in the statute

11

that would prevent that.

12

reject the list that's submitted by the Commission and

13

send it back to the Commission for further deliberations

and a new list.

QUESTION:

In fact, the President can

But in your view, not obligated to

review procedurally.
GENERAL DAYS:

No, he is nor obligated under the

terms of the statute.
QUESTION:

Is the Commission subject to the

20

President's direction in any respect?

Could he stop the

21

Commission from behaving improperly in developing its

22

recommendations if he wanted to?

23

GENERAL DAYS:

There is nothing in the statute

24

that reflects that power on the part of the President.

25

course, the President appoints the Commission after

Of

1

consultation with both sides of the aisle in the Congress,

2

but there is no direct supervision by the President of the

3

activities of the Commission.
The Congress, however, does have a very active

4
5

role to play in this process.

There are at least 10

6

points in the process where Congress has a role to play,

7

starting with the appointment of the Commission itself,

8

and moving through the point where Congress has the

9

ability to enact a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.

So

10

that one would presume that -- although it's not explicit

11

in the statute, that Congress could make its views known

12

during this entire process.

13

facts were that Congress did make its views known from

14

time to time, leading up to this base closure decision.
QUESTION:

15

And, indeed, I think the

General Days, the normal presumption

16

is that legislation and its operation will be subject to

17

judicial review.

18

legislation.

19

why the absence of judicial review is implicit in this

20

scheme?

21

There's no express preclusion in this

Can you summarize for us your argument of

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

You're

22

certainly right that the presumption exists in favor of

23

judicial review, but I don't think the Court has ever held

24

that that presumption and the use of the term "clear and

25

convincing evidence" was designed to impose an evidentiary

1

standard in the sense that we would be talking about if we

2

were talking about parties and the shifting of burdens.
But we think that even given that presumption of

3
4

review, it is weaker in a situation such as this where

5

military sensitivities are involved.

6

about, we must remember, a decision by the Secretary of

7

Defense as to what are the military needs of the United

8

States over a 6-year period, and then trying to work out a

9

closure process that is consistent with that particular

When one is talking

10

determination, and it is a decision ultimately by the

11

President acting in, among other things, his capacity as

12

commander in chief.

13

QUESTION:

Well, might this be different,

14

General Days, if some sort of individual rights in the

15

traditional sense were involved, as they don't seem to be

16

here?

17

GENERAL DAYS:

Certainly, Chief Justice

18

Rehnquist.

19

have been occasions where this Court has exercised

20

jurisdiction, or lower Federal courts have exercised

21

jurisdiction where there was an identifiable right, either

22

a common-law right or a constitutional right.

23

The U.S. Reports reflect the fact that there

But I think one searches in vain in this case to

24

identify such a right.

25

And, indeed, the Third Circuit rejected the notion that

There is not a common-law right.

1

there was a constitutional right presented by this case.

2

There was an assertion in the complaint of a due process

3

violation flowing out of some of the errors that the

4

plaintiffs identify, the respondents identify, but the

5

Third Circuit rejected that particular claim.

6

understand it, respondents now are pressing their

7

constitutional claim, their due process claim, before this

8

Court.

9

QUESTION:

And, as I

So you didn't put it this way, but

10

basically you're saying this is just a pact, a kind of a

11

modus vivendi between the two political branches.
GENERAL DAYS:

12

That's correct, Justice Souter.

13

This was the result of a very long period in which the

14

Congress and the President, for a variety of reasons,

15

found themselves unable to agree upon how base closures

16

should be handled.

17

in the same direction as this 1990 Act, but it was for 1

18

year.

19

In 1988 there was an act that pointed

This particular act incorporated many of those

20

features that the Congress and the President felt had

21

worked well, that had removed most of the avenues for

22

political maneuvering and obstruction, procedural

23

obstruction, which had really prevented the Government

24

from doing what I think everyone recognized needed to be

25

done, given the enormous costs that are incurred when an

1

obsolete base is kept open year after year, and also when

2

it's not needed for the protection of the

United States.

3

So we see this very much as an understanding

4

between the President and the Congress as to how to do

5

this most effectively, and I mentioned -QUESTION:

6

That's a different response than the

7

one that you gave earlier, that judicial review is out of

8

the ballpark because of national -- because national

9

security is involved because these are military bases.

10

The answer that you're now giving to Justice Souter seems

11

to be that this was a determination between the two

12

branches, that this was a matter for them to determine,

13

perhaps - -

14

GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Ginsburg, I don't think

15

my responses are inconsistent.

16

to your point about the presumption, and I think the

17

presumption is weaker under these circumstances.

18

think the history and the structure and purpose of the Act

19

also suggests that judicial review was not viewed by the

20

Congress or anticipated by the Congress as an appropriate

21

way to deal with whatever problems might have arisen under

22

the Act.

23

QUESTION:

I just wanted to respond

But I

Can you conceive of any procedural

irregularity so gross as to invalidate the Commission's

findings?

GENERAL DAYS:

1

Justice Kennedy, one pauses when

2

posed a question like yours, but I think that given the

structure of the Act and given the history and purpose,

there would be no violation that would rise to the level

of judicial review or trigger judicial review.

the Congress.
QUESTION:

-- If the Commission issued a report

in 1994, which it's not authorized to do.

GENERAL DAYS:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And the President acted --

14

transmitted the list, that would be a - - and the Congress

15

refused to act to upset that determination, those bases

16

could be closed without interference from the courts?

17

GENERAL DAYS:

That's correct, Justice Kennedy.

18

This is, after all, a piece of legislation that has a

19

sunset provision.

20

after that point certainly Congress, in due course, could

21

revisit this issue.

22

points during the process where Congress can make its

interests and its concerns felt, and I don't think that

it's appropriate to presume that the Commission or the

unaffected by those expressions of concern.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Day, at what point in the process

3

would you say that Congress would have the best

opportunity to express its concern about procedural

5

shortcomings that are at issue in this case?
GENERAL DAYS:

it can vote out, enact a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.

you'd expect them to react, if at all?

That's correct.

And in this

case - -

QUESTION:

Of course, Mr. --

13

GENERAL DAYS:

14

QUESTION:

Yes.

Senator Specter says they don't have

15

time to do that.

16

that if that's what you're banking on, there won't be any

17

procedural review at all, because he says Congress

18

basically cannot act in the time that the statute would

19

allow it to act.

20

His argument, as I understand it, is

GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Souter, I don't think

21

that's correct.

As I indicated, Congress has the ability

22

to review what's going on in this process at many

23

different points, and in this case it was possible for the

24

Congress to hold hearings, to assign particular issues to

25

committees and subcommittees for resolution.

And we're

1

not talking about something that arrives on the doorstep

2

of the Congress completely unannounced.
QUESTION:

3

General Days, you could say that

4

about any arbitrary or capricious executive action.

5

could always say if Congress doesn't like it, Congress

could have enacted a Joint Resolution of Disapproval,

QUESTION:

It has to

That's correct.

And be signed by the President.
Yes.

So why is this any different from

13

any -- any other instance of executive arbitrariness?

14

Congress can overturn it by a law if it doesn't like it.

15

I don't find that a very persuasive -- it doesn't make me

16

feel better about the arbitrariness in this case.

17

GENERAL DAYS:

18

QUESTION:

19

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes.

If there was any.
I understand that, Justice

20

Scalia.

But this is a situation that I think is not

commonplace.

22

It's one where Congress, as I indicated, is intimately

involved from the beginning to the end.

25

members of the Commission.

It's not like a normal statutory scheme.

QUESTION:

3

Well, he doesn't really have to.

4

He's supposed to, but you've told us you can't imagine

5

any -- you know, any defect that would be bad enough to

6

allow review.

7

Let's assume he doesn't do it.
GENERAL DAYS:

8

9

All you say is he's supposed to do it.

Justice Scalia, I think this is a

risk that Congress felt it was prepared to take, given the

10

problems that the President and Congress had encountered

11

in the past in dealing with the whole base closure issue.

12

This particular problem of cherry-picking was one that had

13

brought the President and Congress to impasse in many

14

instances.

15

extent to which political considerations entered into the

16

process; that some people got better treatment or some

17

bases got better treatment than others.

18

And also there was this concern about the

QUESTION:

General Days, in this statute where

Congress may, if it disapproves, pass a joint resolution,

20

would that Joint Resolution of Disapproval have to be

signed by the President?

22

23
24

GENERAL DAYS:

Yes, it would, it would have to

accord with the presentment clause of the Constitution.

that this would go through the presentment process.

that.
QUESTION:

That everything -- that you could no

longer have anything, you think, even the Federal rules

procedure?

12

GENERAL DAYS:

Well,

I think that's a different

13

scheme, Justice Ginsburg, but in this particular case

we're talking about an enactment by the Congress, by the

15

entire Congress.

That's not your argument, is it?

that certain bases need to be closed, the Commission makes

basically an effort to get courts to review presidential

action.

has the discretion to decide what he's going to do under

This is discretion that is not bound by the terms of the

Although the argument has been made by the

respondents that this is somehow different from Franklin,

5

we've never viewed Franklin as a decision about artful

of the presidential process or presidential action.

1

Yes.

Well, I think, Justice

2

Scalia, the involvement of Congress really goes to the

3

point that I was making earlier, that even if you disagree

4

with our argument and find that there was final action

5

under the APA and therefore reviewability, the Act itself

6

does not, we submit, contemplate judicial review.

7

of the reasons for that is the involvement of Congress,

8

the need for expedition, the fact that in this legislation

9

Congress recognized that the NEPA process was one that had

And one

10

been used for a variety of reasons to delay the process,

11

and therefore NEPA was completely taken out of the

12

statute.

13

QUESTION:

But why doesn't that cut the other

14

way, General Days, that they noticed that NEPA could slow

15

things down, so they made an exception for it, but they

16

didn't make an across-the-board exception?

17

GENERAL DAYS:

Justice Ginsburg, I think that

18

the NEPA exception doesn't go so much to the question of

judicial review.

20

argument that what Congress intended to do was take NEPA

21

out but allow other types of procedural challenges to be

22

reviewed by the courts, but rather as a determination that

23

NEPA imposes certain procedural requirements on agencies

24

that, apart from judicial review, can be used to slow

25

down, delay the process that Congress wanted to be handled

that that's where the review was to take place and not

GENERAL DAYS:

part of the respondents to substitute judicial

That would be my advice to him, because I would say to

him, Mr. President, you cannot have a determination as to

the failure of the Navy to supply the information to the

You can't call in two admirals who sent reports that

the yard should be kept open which were fraudulently

11

concealed from the GAO and the Congress, you can't call in

the admiral and have him testify that he was instructed by

the Navy, which is an obstruction of justice not to

SENATOR SPECTER:

I'm saying that he acted

of a determination, which is judicial.

with the statute on one list, and he knows there's a
