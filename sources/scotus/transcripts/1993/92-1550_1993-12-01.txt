ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN V. JANSONIUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JANSONIUS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

remedies.

12

who testifies in an unfair labor practice case under oath,

13

and who testifies untruthfully, may share in the remedy

14

that may be entered at the conclusion of that proceeding.

The issue in this case is whether an individual

18

dockworkers to prevail in this case is Mr. Michael Manso.

Mr. Manso was discharged on August 17, 1989, ostensibly

20

for being late for work that day.

Ironically, the only one of those

At the hearing in Albuquerque, he testified as

22

to the reason he was late for work.

He said that his car

had broken down on the way in, that he'd had to call his

24

wife and that she came and picked him up and then took him

on to work, at which time he was pulled over by a highway

judge concluded that Mr. Manso was lying in testifying as

3

to his reason for being late for work that day.

4

The judge heard all that testimony, and the

In an adversary system for resolving disputes,

5

we believe that the oath that a witness takes is

6

absolutely vital, that it's fundamental to the process.

7

The first step to correctly applying the law is to decide

8

the facts correctly in the first place, and a witness who

9

does not honor the oath makes that process much more

10

difficult for the courts and in this case for the

11

administrative law judge.

12

Perhaps more than in any other context in the

13

Federal system a correct outcome on the facts in unfair

14

labor practice cases is dependent on witnesses honoring

15

their oaths.

16

filed in the first instance is normally decided by counsel

17

for the general counsel or by the regional offices of the

18

NLRB simply based on affidavits.

19

statements to the NLRB's are under oath, and their

20

statements are taken at face value for the most part, and

21

whether or not there is even going to be a case depends on

22

whether that individual is giving a true affidavit.

All right.
I do know the unfair labor

practice, though, followed by the NLRB, and I think that

QUESTION:

Well, the --

Even if it turns out that,

notwithstanding what clearly was a lie on some point, that

the employer is entitled to judgment?

6

MR. JANSONIUS:

If I'm following, you're saying

what is the situation if the representative of management

Yes.

Yes.

prevails in the case?
QUESTION:

Well, under the law and the facts,

15

the company should prevail.

16

Must relief be denied under your rule, a per se rule?

17

MR. JANSONIUS:

What must be done there?

I think there are two

18

possibilities.

Number 1, if there has been no unfair

19

labor practice, I'm not certain that the NLRB has

20

jurisdiction to do anything about it.

21

I do think that, assuming that they do have

22

jurisdiction, that they have remedial power that they

23

could craft a remedy in that situation, that they could

24

deal with it.

25

They, for instance, could make the employer post

situation coming before us.

16

QUESTION:

I'm not aware of that

Let me ask you this:

did this

17

employer introduce evidence that under every circumstance,

18

if they had an employer they discovered who had lied, the

1

employer would be discharged, that that was the rule of

20

the employer?

21

MR. JANSONIUS:

That specific evidence was not

22

presented, but the evidence was presented in the sense

23

that it's in our collective bargaining agreement that

24

dishonesty is grounds for immediate termination, so

25

certainly the collective bargaining representatives, or

1

the union representatives and the management

2

representatives who negotiated the contract felt that

3

dishonesty was a serious offense.

4

QUESTION:

But as we take this case, the

5

employee was not discharged for dishonesty but for other

6

things.

7

MR. JANSONIUS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

That's true.

I mean, that's how it comes to us,

anyway.
MR. JANSONIUS:

That's true, and the -- I will

11

tell you that the evidence on that point was somewhat

12

equivocal, and that may be - -

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes, but I mean, we take it on that

basis, I guess.

15

MR. JANSONIUS:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, you do.

Yes --

Are you prevented from discharging

17

the employee now because of the dishonesty that you

18

learned he has engaged in, that you now know he has

19

engaged in?

20

MR. JANSONIUS:

I think we could, Your Honor.

21

I'm not sure how the collective bargaining agreement

22

applies in that situation, whether that would be a

23

contractual issue between ABF and its union

24

representatives.

The ALJ found that a couple of the employer's

Your Honor, I don't think he

made that finding.

11

employer's witnesses on some comments that supposedly were

12

made when Mr. Manso returned to work on one occasion.

13

used much stronger language in characterizing Mr. Manso's

14

testimony, and I think there was a reason for that.

15

was very clear that Mr. Manso was not just mistaken on the

16

facts or had a faulty memory.

17

that was not true.

18

QUESTION:

He did discredit some of the

He was contriving a story

I don't think -Well, how does that differ -- there

were three officers who, according to Manso, said, watch

20

out, the boss is gunning for you, and they said, we never

21

said any such thing.

22

they out-and-out lying?

23

Now, if they said that, why aren't

MR. JANSONIUS:

Well, there could be a number of

24

explanations for it.

25

It could be a statement that was blown out of context.

They could simply have forgotten.

It

might be something that their memory of the event differs

2

from Mr. Manso's memory of the event.

you can say necessarily that because a witness' testimony

is not credited that they're being deliberately

The ALJ says,

These

Why aren't they lying?
MR. JANSONIUS:

11

Well, I don't think you can make

12

that assumption that they're lying, because the events

13

that had occurred were months in advance of that.
QUESTION:

14
15

When the ALJ says,

-- so even if they are both lying,

all you're asking is that both liars be treated equally.

Neither one of them gets any relief.

MR. JANSONIUS:

QUESTION:

6

MR. JANSONIUS:

Well, that's true --

That's fair, isn't it?
-- I would be satisfied with

7

that.

I don't like the equation, though, that our

8

witnesses lied, and I don't think you can say -QUESTION:

MR. JANSONIUS:

10
11

-- that they were speaking for

the corporation.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, but there's a difference --

-- in giving relief to the side

that's lying, and in giving relief to nobody at all.

14

QUESTION:

Yes, but --

15

MR. JANSONIUS:

I agree with that, and the fact

16

is that we are not contesting the total award entered by

17

the NLRB.

18

QUESTION:

But your position as a matter of law,

1

as I understand it, is that even if an employee's of --

20

even if a management representative testifies blatantly

21

falsely, and in all other respects the charge should fail

22

against the employer, you wouldn't say well, you go ahead

guilty of blatant falsehoods, would you?

MR. JANSONIUS:

No, I wouldn't.

I think that

sometimes employers are charging parties in unfair labor

practice cases.

are, and if they do go in and abuse the process, I don't

It's not very often, but they sometimes

QUESTION:

They normally refrain from

Well, what's wrong with saying this

answer on the part of the employee, that that -- even if

5

it's a bad answer, it's good enough for a bad charge,

6

because if the lateness is a phony excuse, if the employer

wants to get rid of this employee because he's been pro­

arbitrariness, although I think it exists here.
QUESTION:

Well, how else can we reverse the

Board's determination?
MR. JANSONIUS:

Well, under the statute, I guess

5

the issue is whether awarding relief, reinstatement and

6

backpay to somebody who has deliberately given false

7

testimony will effectuate the purposes of the act.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, isn't the legal proposition

that you're putting forth that the National Labor

10

Relations Board is arbitrary if it fails to adopt a rule

11

that refuses relief to any employee who lies -- lies, I

12

suppose, on a material matter?

13

MR. JANSONIUS:

Yes.

I believe that it is an

14

arbitrary position, if not just an erroneous as a matter

15

of law position, for the NLRB to state that someone who

16

abuses the process by coming in and giving false testimony

17

is entitled to backpay and reinstatement, and that doing

18

that will effectuate the purposes of the act.

19

I don't see how the Board can make that case

20

that putting somebody back to work, giving them backpay in

21

this situation, is going to effectuate the purposes of the

22

act, and I think that is why the Congress assigned this

23

Court with supervisory responsibility over the Board.

24
25

There have been many instances over the years
where this Court looked at NLRB remedies and made the

conclusion that what the NLRB did perhaps ran afoul or

2

interfered with other Federal policies and corrected the

3

Board on the remedy that it entered, and this is one of

4

those situations where I believe that is appropriate.

5

I think it's particularly appropriate in the

NLRB context, just because of the nature of the

7

proceedings themselves.

We have very few safeguards for
The oath is

10

The Board serves as prosecutor, they serve as

11

judge, they serve as jury, they hear the first level of

12

appeal, there's no discovery, there's no way for an

13

employer like ABF to know in advance of a hearing what the

14

Government's evidence is going to be, who the witnesses

15

are going to be, what they're going to say.

16

even get statements from individuals who have given

affidavits to the National Labor Relations Board until

they actually take the stand at the hearing, and even then

19

only after they've testified.

QUESTION:

You can't

Mr. Jansonius, this would be a rather

21

sweeping proposition if the Court were to accept it.

16

MR. JANSONIUS:

No.

In the civil litigation

system I'm not aware of any rule with that effect.

think it's the practical reality of litigation in the

Federal district courts that individuals whose testimony

20

is discredited on material points don't prevail.

What about courts of equity,

Mr. Jansonius?

Do you think a court of equity which has

various forms of relief available couldn't say, we're

24

going to give one form of relief rather than another

25

because you affronted the court by perjuring yourself?

that the Board used to do it the way that you now suggest,

MR. JANSONIUS:

No, I don't think it slowed down

compels the Board to take that view?

MR. JANSONIUS:

Your Honor, what compels the

Board to take that view is I believe, number 1, starting

8

with section 1 of the act which sets out the purposes, I

don't see that reinstating someone with backpay and giving

them money damages or reinstatement is going to effectuate

11

any of the purposes set out in section 1 of the act.

believe section 10(c) of the act makes some remedies

separates this case from the standard unfair labor

practice case where the discretion has been accorded the

20

Board to mold the remedies under section 10(c) with very

little review is the fact that we do have other policies

10

There's a few points I'd like to make in that

First, as I said in my opening comment, getting

11

at the true facts of the case is the first step to

12

correctly applying the law.

13

honor the oath, that's going to interfere with the NLRB's

14

and any other agency's ability to get at the true facts

15

and to correctly apply the law, so just from a very broad

16

proposition, a witness who is not telling the truth is

17

undermining an agency's ability to enforce and protect the

18

purposes of the statute.

19

If a witness is not going to

There are other reasons as well why I believe

20

that the Board's order in this case cannot possibly

21

effectuate the purposes of the act.

22

it's just common sense that putting someone like Mr. Manso

23

back to work is going to be saddling ABF with a

24

contractual relationship with someone who it has very good

25

grounds not to trust, and there's certainly going to be a

1

loss of respect between the employer and employee, and I

2

don't think that a working relationship with someone who

3

has taken advantage of the system and the employer the way

4

Mr. Manso has could be said to do anything to reduce labor

5

strife or to promote the free flow of commerce.
I think that the act, the purposes of the act

6

7

are frustrated in this context by encouraging false

claims.

9

forum to charging parties -- and it should be a receptive

The NLRB is going to look like a very friendly

10

forum, I'm not saying that, otherwise -- but it's going to

11

look like a system where the Government can be taken

12

advantage of, and I don't think that effectuates the

13

purposes of the act.

14

I think the remedy that the Board has ordered in

15

this case undermines ABF's collectively bargained

16

agreements procedure.

Mr. Manso went through the

17

agreements procedure.

A three -- or six-member panel

18

equally composed of labor and management concluded that he

19

should not be put back to work, concluded that he was not

20

entitled to backpay.

21

Given what's happened, I think that the

22

Grievance Committee that ABF has negotiated with the local

23

union of the Teamsters is going to look like a less

24

receptive forum, and there's going to be more tendency to

25

try and sidestep the grievance procedure knowing that the

NLRB is going to be more forgiving of those who try to

2

take advantage of the system.

3

For all those reasons, I think that the Board's

4

order in this case, or in any similar context, is not

5

effectuating the purposes of the act, and again I would

6

say that I think that the NLRB needs to be reminded that

7

it does not apply the act in a vacuum.
This Court has said several times that other

8

9

considerations have to be taken into account when crafting

10

unfair labor practice remedies.

11

did so in Detroit Edison, it did so in Lechmere, it's done

12

so in other cases.

13

It did so in Sure-Tan, it

And the NLRB in this case did apply the act in a

14

vacuum, it did take a very narrow reading of public

15

policy, and looked strictly at the National Labor

16

Relations Act instead of taking other concerns into

17

account which we believe that they are compelled to do,

18

and we believe that this Court as the supervisor over the

19

NLRB should make it clear to them that they've got to take

20

the oath seriously, that it is a public policy that it be

21

honored, and that should be made a stronger part of the

22

National Labor Relations Act.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5
6

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Under the limited grant of certiorari in this

7

case, the question presented is a legal question about the

8

Board's remedial authority, and as petitioner recognizes,

9

that remedial authority is a creature of statute.

It's

10

set forth in section 10(c) of the National Labor Relations

11

Act, which is reproduced in full in the appendix to the

12

certiorari petition, the white-covered certiorari

13

petition, at page C-5 toward the very end of the appendix

14

to the petition.

15

It's a rather lengthy provision, but there are

16

two discrete portions of it that have relevance here.

17

first is at about ten lines down in the middle of the

18

sentence, beginning close to the beginning of the line,

19

"After the Board has found that there's an unfair labor

20

practice it ordinarily issues a cease and desist order,

21

and it's authorized then, and to take such affirmative

22

action, including reinstatement of employees with or

23

without backpay, as

MR. WALLACE:

About ten lines down within

subsection (c):

affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees

7

of this act."

8

9

"The Board is authorized to take such

And then about twelve lines from the bottom of
this provision there is a sentence that begins, just past

10

the middle of the line, that says,

11

shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an

12

employee who has been suspended or discharged or the

13

payment to him of any backpay if such individual was

14

suspended or discharged for cause."

15

"No order of the Board

Except for that provision, one searches in vain

16

for an express limitation in the statute on the Board's

17

remedial authority in ordering reinstatement or backpay in

18

accordance with the Board's judgment of what will

19

effectuate the policies of the act, and in this case there

20

was a determination made by the Board -- on page B-21 of

21

the appendix to the petition - - that this was not a

22

discharge for cause, that the cause given was a pretext

23

for discrimination.

24
25

That finding was upheld by the court of
appeals -- on pages A-14 to A-18 of the appendix to the

petition -- and that question is not at issue here under

2

the Court's limited grant of jurisdiction.

3

So the only express limitation in the statute

4

that the courts obviously would have to consider enforcing

5

against the Board in limiting its remedial authority is

6

not applicable here, and the question becomes, as Justice

7

Kennedy very aptly phrased it in his question, whether the

8

Board was arbitrary in - - has been arbitrary in the

9

standards it has adopted in determining when reinstatement

10

11

and backpay will effectuate the policies of the act.
QUESTION:

Or an abuse of discretion --

12

arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise

13

not in accordance with law, as the APA says, and the

14

contention here is that it's an abuse of discretion, I

15

gather, substantially.

16

MR. WALLACE:

Well, the Court has formulated it

17

in numerous ways, many of which we collected in our brief.

18

The first decision of this Court dealing specifically with

19

the question of reinstatement was the 1941 decision,

20

written by Justice Frankfurter for the Court in the Phelps

21

Dodge case, and we have set out a relevant quotation from

22

that on the very last page of our brief, in which the

23

Court upheld in that case the Board's authority to order

24

reinstatement as a remedy for employees who had found

25

other employment and were not entitled to backpay.

1

The Court emphasized that because the relation

2

of remedy to policy, which is the statutory criterion, is

3

peculiarly a matter for administrative competence, courts

4

must not enter the allowable area of the Board's

5

discretion and must guard against the danger of sliding

6

unconsciously from the narrow confines of law into the

7

more spacious domain of policy.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, is there any doubt that

the lie told here in this legal proceeding, of which this

10

is the last stage, the court of appeals being the

11

intermediate stage - - is there any doubt that it was

than a lie given by an employee who has not endured a

2

similar history of mistreatment by the employer, and the

employee's adherence to his story before the ALJ -- the

felony -- though unjustifiable -- felonies are

perjurer is compelled to be rehired so that everyone who
goes to NLRB proceedings will understand how understanding

11

proceedings?
MR. WALLACE:

12

Well, Mr. Justice, we certainly

13

would not disclaim the authority to prosecute for perjury

14

in this case or any other, and we have collected cases in

15

our brief in which the Board has referred matters to the

16

Justice Department for prosecution -- this is on page --

perjury in proceedings before the Board, and as there are

appropriate remedy is for a proven unfair labor practice.

MR. WALLACE:

comes through in the Precision Window opinion, which said

that the Board is not entitled -- the Board is barred from

awarding reinstatement or backpay to - - in favor of a

charging party who has lied in the proceedings before the

10
11

Board.
I would mention, however, that the court did not

12

take the position that it was barred from upholding the

13

Board's entry of a cease and desist order.

14

The question ultimately has to be whether the

Board acted beyond its authority.

is being asked to determine when the question before the

something that could easily be determined in this

particular case.

10

It happened to be

But my point is a point that you yourself made

in a question earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, that if it

MR. WALLACE:

as the Lear-Siegler case which we discussed at some

in the Board proceeding.

with the question.
MR. WALLACE:

Precisely so, because the Board

6

did not consider it determinative of what the appropriate

7

remedy should be.

8

QUESTION:

Well, in Lear-Siegler the Board was

9

upset that an employee that -- had manipulated a witness,

10

and the Board was very protective of its own turf, saying

11

that you've interfered with out processes, but in Owens

12

Illinois the Board awarded reinstatement to a line

employee because the employer had not demonstrated that

14

the employee was unfit, so it seems to me that you give

15

very little consideration to the injury that the employer

16

faces when the employer has to mount the burden of proving

17

perjury, which the employer in this case did.

18

MR. WALLACE:

The Board does make a distinction

19

between backpay and reinstatement.

It will toll backpay

20

if there has been misconduct or misuse of its proceedings

21

as a means of protecting the integrity of its proceedings,

22

but it explained in Lear-Siegler that that is not in

23

itself a sufficient reason to deny reinstatement of an

24

employee as a remedy for an unfair labor practice because

25

of the importance of reinstatement to protecting the

What they are aware of is not what happened at

That

terminate him for that reason, the employer could do so,

3

and it would be a termination for cause.

4

All the act prohibits is discrimination for

5

exercising the rights protected by the act, which is what

6

was found to have been done here, and the remedial

7

question is all in a context of what has been proven in

8

proper proceedings, which is not a felony but an unfair

9

labor practice by the employer, and whether the Board

10

should apply its normal remedies for the unfair labor

11

practice.

12

There were statements made by both sides in this

13

proceeding that the Board determined to have been false.

14

The Board had no occasion to - - even the ALJ had no

15

occasion to decide whether the three supervisors

16

testifying on behalf of the employee -- of the employer

17

had been purposefully lying, although the circumstances of

18

rejecting the credibility of their testimony would suggest

19

that it's quite probable that they were.

20

So it's quite probable that several felonies

21

were committed by persons on both sides here.

something transparently foolish about the charging party's

answer to Justice Stevens' question that yes, the Board

were that the rule were needed to effectuate the policies

16

of the act, which do require that the Board hearings be

conducted with accurate testimony before it and that can

18

rely on sworn statements and the rest of it, but the Board

19

has taken a more balanced approach.

20

There are other purposes of the act to be

effectuated as well, and the remedies that it has adopted,

22

just as the remedies that it has adopted in cases of
