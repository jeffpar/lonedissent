ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROGOW:

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Since the statute of Anne in 1709 through the

12

Copyright Clause of our Constitution, through the

13

copyright statute and until today, the purpose of

14

copyright has been to encourage creativity.

15

creative force in our society and has historically been a

16

creative force, and parody should be encouraged.

17

Parody is a

The decision of the Sixth Circuit discouraged

18

parody, and we ask the Court today to reverse the decision

19

of the Sixth Circuit.

20

parody is a fair use unless it materially impairs the

21

market for the original, and material impairment of the

22

market for the original means supplant the original.

QUESTION:

MR. ROGOW:

So it has to poke fun at the original

MR. ROGOW:

4

Not necessarily.

It can poke fun at

the original, or it can poke fun at something else using

the original work.

8

the other would be criticism of society using the original

9

work as a means of conveying that criticism.

10

There are two aspects of the

One would be criticism of the original work,

So that any time someone takes a

11

melodic line and substitutes new lyrics, that is permitted

12

13

MR. ROGOW:

As long as -- yes, Justice Kennedy,

14

as long as it is making fun of something else in society

Well, Mr. Rogow, that's a little
isn't it,

for this case?

For this case -Don't we have a situation here where

it's making fun of the original?
MR. ROGOW:

We do, Justice O'Connor.

2

parody, if it's directed at something other than the

3

original work, should have some kind of all-encompassing

provision as being a fair use.

MR. ROGOW:

QUESTION:

7

Justice -I mean that's -- that's a pretty big

step to take.
MR. ROGOW:

8

9

So I think your position that a

Justice O'Connor, for this case it

is true that the parody in this case only poked fun at the

10

original.

And one could limit this case to just those

11

facts and that would be quite fine.

12

actually quite helpful to us, because Harper & Row -- it

13

is true, it was the Nation, a news magazine, but it

14

materially impaired the market for the Harper & Row

15

publication.

16

factor here, impairment of the market.

And I think that's the other important

QUESTION:

17

Harper & Row is

So it's your position that a parody

18

should be found to be a fair use when it

same?

MR. ROGOW:

One -- yes.

when the

One needs to use the

music from the original in order to evoke the image of the

what happened in this case.
So, yes, there does have to be some taking from

that the listener would know that what was being made fun

of was the original.
QUESTION:

Some of which was

Mr. Rogow, could you explain to me

why -- why criticism either of the original song or, as

10

your position states, of almost anything using the

11

original song, is to be encouraged more than, let's say,

12

patriotism?

13

that anyone's ever written in order to set patriotic

14

lyrics to it?

15

encouraged?

Why shouldn't be I be able to use any song

Isn't that something that's to be

MR. ROGOW:

16

It is, although one can encourage

17

patriotism without necessarily borrowing the music from

18

another tune, although historically we have borrowed from

19

other tunes to have patriotic songs.
QUESTION:

20

Well, but one can criticize other

21

things without borrowing the music from a tune.

22

you're willing to limit your proposition as much as

23

Justice O'Connor just suggested, your argument doesn't

24

hold.

1

exactly these facts.
QUESTION:

2

And so are -- but let's assume the

3

more general proposition that you were trying to

4

establish.

What's your answer to my question for that?
MR. ROGOW:

5

That as long as the parody is

6

commenting critically upon society,, be it cultural, be it

7

social -- the social aspect of society, be it political,

8

the use of the tune would still fall within the definition

9

of criticism, which has to have some breathing room.
QUESTION:

10

But why encourage -- you can

11

criticize society in many ways.

12

can -- you can -- you can make fun of this particular tune

only by using the particular tune.

15

different ways;

You're quite right.

But you can make fun

You can criticize society in a lot of
why do you have to take my tune to do it?

MR. ROGOW:

Because sometimes taking that tune

17

conveys to the listener something extra.

for example, the Home Box Office video --

It's catchy.

2

certain image, and then the criticism that is conveyed by

3

Capitol Hillbillies, the parody, is useful.

4

Now, using the Beverly Hillbillies evokes a

I think that's a threshold issue here.
Is criticism useful?

Is

5

parody useful?

6

copyright law does say that criticism is useful and should

7

be encouraged.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ROGOW:

And 107 of the

Is patriotism useful?
Yes, it is useful, but pure

10

patriotism without making the political comment, critical

11

comment, is not embraced within 107, although I'm not

12

saying it isn't something worthwhile of protection.

13

Obviously, it is.

14

where we have on one side the private interest of the

15

copyright holder, versus the public interest and the

16

historical interest of promoting creativity.

17

But we're in this narrow copyright area

And if parody does have a creative force in our

18

society, and we suggest that it does.

19

does.

20

Historically it

The Capitol Steps have given this Court -QUESTION:

Well, certainly the copyright

21

statutes suggest that there's a strong public interest in

22

protecting the copyright holder.

23

it's very difficult to suggest, as you do, that there's

24

only a private interest on one side, where there's a great

25

public interest on the other.

So I -- it seems to me

MR. ROGOW:

1

It is a mixed interest, really, on

2

the copyright holder's side.

copyright, subject to the fair use statutory provisions in

7

that will be a fair use, for the greater good of society.

So the statute -- so the statute tells the copyright

The private interest, the

QUESTION:

Yeah, I don't -- I don't doubt for a

minute what you say the statute says.

But you're

10

suggesting -- that there's only a private interest on one

11

side while there's only a large -- while there's a large

12

public interest on the other, I don't think is accurate.

13

I think the statute itself suggests there's a strong

14

public interest in encouraging works that can be

15

copyrighted.

16

MR. ROGOW:

I agree, Mr. Chief Justice.

And

17

when I said a private interest, the primary thrust,

18

obviously, in a copyright case is protecting that private

19

interest.

21

good for the public, and that's the point --

22

The larger thrust is this is good for the

QUESTION:

But a fair use is also

Mr. Rogow, you started out by

23

defining parody, and that first step, I think the Sixth

24

Circuit, even if grudgingly, took and said, yes, this

25

falls within parody.

But you're not saying that if it's

1

parody, it is necessarily a permissible fair use.

2

MR. ROGOW:

3

QUESTION:

I'm not, Justice Ginsburg.
So what in the -- since the Fifth

4

Circuit -- the Sixth Circuit agreed with you that we are

5

dealing here with parody, where did the Sixth Circuit go

6

wrong?

7

MR. ROGOW:

By applying a presumption that if it

8

is a commercial parody, then it is presumptively harmful

9

to the market.

10

And they drew that from the language in

Sony and Harper & Row v. Nation.
QUESTION:

11

But there's language in our cases

12

that say exactly that.

13

commercial nature of the use is a factor to be considered,

14

but it isn't -- even if it is found to be for a commercial

15

purpose, that that isn't the end of the inquiry.

17

Is it your position that the

MR. ROGOW:

That is our position, Justice

QUESTION:

Now, what is the market that we

should look at.

the market -- do we look at whether it would supplant,

21

somehow, the demand for the original work?

look at?

Is it the market for parodies, or is it

What is it we

And did the Sixth Circuit find that

that was erroneous?

13

MR. ROGOW:

--

It did not.

It applied a

Go ahead.
QUESTION:

Shouldn't the market be defined more

broadly as the market for the original song in the - - in

the fashion in which the original song was sung.

there could be - - there could be, you know, rock adaptions

7

broadly enough to include all the possible adaptations

8

that the copyright owner might want to - - to make or to

9

license?
MR. ROGOW:

10

Justice Souter,

I mean,

I don't have any

11

difficulty with a broad definition of the market.

What's

12

lacking in this case is any proof that any market for the

13

Orbison-Dees song was harmed.

14

about it, but no proof about it.

All -- all we have is talk

And I think -- and the rule that I'm suggesting

15
16

puts this case in a trial court in this posture.

If the

17

defendant raises the affirmative defense of fair use

18

parody,

19

that it is a parody, and then the four factors are

20

certainly relevant:

21

QUESTION:

then the first thing the defendant must show is

purpose -May I just interrupt you though,

22

before you get to the four factors?

Are you saying that

23

the -- that the district court could not have made any

24

findings because of the total absence of evidence on the

25

effect on the broader market which I described?

MR. ROGOW:

Justice Ginsburg, it -- it has both.

14

It's -- obviously, the courts have had difficulty with how

15

one uses these four factors.

16

the first factor, something to look at;

17

commercial use, as opposed to a nonprofit use, an

18

educational use?

19

kinds of uses.

But it is independently, in

work -- work.

On the other hand, of course, the parody is

2

creative itself, but I could give points to Orbison-Dees

3

on the second factor.
The third factor is an interesting one in this

4
5

case, the amount and substantiality of the taking.

And,

6

of course, in a parody, in order to evoke the original,

7

one must take a substantial part.

we are going to have substantial taking, especially if

we're talking about, as we are in this case, a parody of

In this case

11

there was taking and there is no dispute that some of the

MR. ROGOW:

At page 321 of the Joint Appendix

7

record to be supplemented, of Mr. Flowers who is a

this late-filed affidavit any credence in this case,

nothing that addresses whether or not their market has

been materially impaired.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rogow, my problem is this;

I

16

don't see how your -- one is entitled to summary judgment

if the legal issue in the case is to be decided by a six

18

factor test, if the other party happens to have produced

no evidence on one of the six factors?

you've produced some evidence on some of the factors,

3

If one factor was disputed in a way that created a genuine

issue as to material fact and then, in the equation, one

5

couldn't make the fair use finding without litigating that

factor, then summary judgment would not be proper.

MR. ROGOW:

QUESTION:

Is fair use an affirmative defense?
It is.
So the burden of negating fair use in

11

a motion for summary judgment, then, is on the person

12

claiming the fair use?

13

MR. ROGOW:

The ultimate burden is to show fair

14

use as the affirmative defense as these factors unfold.

15

And I think this goes to the presumption, Mr. Chief

16

Justice -- when the plaintiff files the lawsuit, all the

17

plaintiff need show is ownership of the copyright and

18

copying, and then the burden shifts to the defendant to

19

raise the fair use affirmative defense.

parody as a form of criticism protected by fair use under

QUESTION:

Is the underlying theory of your case

2

that if there is a market to be exploited, in this case

3

280,000 copies, and it can be exploited best through a

4

parody, that it is essentially fair that the person who

5

creates the parody receives 100 percent of the profit?

6

MR. ROGOW:

No.

The thrust of my case, Justice

7

Kennedy, is not that.

The thrust of my case is that if a

8

parody is a creative, true parodic work, then is it -- it

9

is entitled to be called a fair use unless there is

10

evidence that it has materially impaired or supplanted the

11

market for the original.

12

The original does not hold the absolute right to

13

preclude any other use of that original work.

And the

14

fact that 280,000 or 2,000 records were sold is not the

15

decisive fact here.

MR. ROSDEITCHER:

11

It could be.

In fact, any

12

change in the lyrics that's funny seems to me to be a

13

parody.

14

could be read back to criticize the original because if

15

it's funny it's mocking it, poking fun at it, and

therefore it would be a parody and it would be fair use

and they could profit by it.

It makes ridiculous the original situation.
