Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

QUESTION:

Ms. Ibanez, may I inquire of you?

14

You --do you acknowledge that you engage in public

15

accounting on occasion?

MS. IBANEZ:

Your Honor, the record is clear,

accounting is subject to Chapter 473.
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

And did you take a different position

earlier in the litigation?
MS. IBANEZ:

No, Your Honor.

I believe that the

5

entire record of the rule challenge proceedings clearly

6

states that Petitioner understands that Chapter 473 has

7

two different layers of regulation.

8

covers all CPA's good moral conduct, continuing education

9

requirements and so forth and so on.

10

The first layer

There is a second layer of regulation that, by

11

the express provisions of Chapter 473 and some other

12

rules, are conditioned on the practice of public

13

accounting.

14

QUESTION:

Reading the briefs, I got the

15

impression that the position you've taken has shifted

16

somewhat during the course of the proceedings.

17

MS. IBANEZ:

Your Honor, I believe the record is

18

clear that in the rule challenge proceedings, a lot of

19

hypothetical questions were posed -- that was not the

20

disciplinary proceeding -- and the questions, I believe,

21

and the answers are consistent.

22

QUESTION:

And does the Board take the position

23

that your law firm somehow has to be licensed or

24

authorized as -- by the Board of Accounting for

25

accountancy?

is somebody reading that ad supposed to verify what that

11

means and whether you're a member in good standing of

12

13

MS. IBANEZ:

Your Honor, the record is clear, at

14

the disciplinary transcript found at the joint appendix,

15

that the public is very well aware and informed about the

16

CFP credentialing -- considers it quite valuable.

The question I asked was

whether your advertisement, the one at issue here, had any

explanation about the CFP designation?

MS. IBANEZ:

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

Well, could -- could the State

11

require some explanation of the certified financial

12

planner designation?

13

MS. IBANEZ:

I believe that the State could

certainly require, as to the CPA, some disclaimer.

that disclaimer is the threshold issue.

I think it was a concise answer.

not done so here.

3

QUESTION:

It has

In other words, your position, then,

4

is that a State may require some sort of disclaimer or

5

explanation of the use of the term C -- certified

6

financial planner, CFP, either when that is used by

7

someone in conjunction with advertising their services as

8

an attorney, or in advertising their services as an

9

accountant?

10

MS. IBANEZ:

Yes, Your Honor, with the following

11

qualification if I may, because it's the CPA credential

12

that's the threshold issue.

13

additional information required of a CPA licensee within

14

attorney advertising that would say, for example, not

15

engaged in public accounting, or a positive disclaimer

16

that says, attorney engaged in the practice of law, then

17

that disclaimer would serve as to all other multiple

18

credentials, whether Petitioner includes two, three or

19

four credentials that are all, on its face, truthful

20

communications, rather than require Petitioner to add

21

disclaimers to every credential.

22

only confuse the public.

QUESTION:

And now we're developing the practice among
lawyers of using E-S-Q, Esquire.

5

MS. IBANEZ:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
May I ask -- you said there are two

7

levels of regulation by the Accountancy Board, and you

8

comply with one about your general qualifications.

9

gather you do not comply with the different level?

10

MS. IBANEZ:

And I

Your Honor, Petitioner has not been

11

charged as to whether she complies or doesn't comply

12

regarding the allegation of unlicensed firm status; only

13

when she is confronted directly, and not indirectly, can

14

she be afforded her due process rights.

15

can be a conclusion, and not a summary conclusion, about

16

whether she has violated this provision or not.

17

QUESTION:

And then there

18

- - what is the nature of the reg - - the second layer of

19

regulation?

they require that arguably you may or may not do?

22

talking about here?

What are we talking about anyway?

1

the regulations and the statutes with the phrase "only if

2

engaged in the practice of public accounting."

3

apparently there is some concern from the State that in

4

some areas this would apply to only CPA's in public

5

accounting and not to other CPA's engaged in the practice

6

of law or banking or other professions.

QUESTION:

But I still don't understand what

this second layer of regulation regulates.

10

could you possibly violate that?

11

that.
MS. IBANEZ:

12

So,

What does it

I mean, what -- how

I don't even understand

Well, I could possibly think of one

13

example in the area of contingency fees, for example.

Were you ever told -- was Petitioner

ever told expressly what she must do to bring herself into

compliance with the regulation that she was censured for

MS. IBANEZ:

No, Your Honor.

clear that she was never even given the opportunity.

ask your opponent this rather than you -- but could a CPA,

19

without violating the regulations, who is a practicing

20

CPA, does tax work and audits and all that sort of stuff

21

-- could such a CPA put on his or her business card, also

22

a member of the Florida Bar?

MS. IBANEZ:

I am not quite sure what the answer

24

would be to that question.

QUESTION:

MS. IBANEZ:

I believe it is constitutionally

permitted.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, from a constitutional

standpoint, what's your answer to that question?

6

7

So, when the shoe is on the

In other words, there is a

constitutional right for an accountant to say that -- who

10

is practicing as an accounting -- to list on their

11

letterhead or in their professional announcement the fact

12

that they are an attorney?

13

MS. IBANEZ:

Yes, Your Honor, I think that this

14

Court's commercial speech cases in the area of attorney

15

advertising clearly articulate the doctrine of truthful

16

speech, on its face, passive speech, non-coercive,

17

relevant to the listener -- because the public interest is

18

very well served by providing them more information, not

19

less.

20

QUESTION:

One other question.

Since you

21

indicate -- I think this was your position -- that a

22

disclaimer or an explanation of CFP might be required,

23

should this case be remanded?

24
25

MS. IBANEZ:

No, Your Honor.

I believe the

Board's position in its order is clear -- they use the

1

advertising rule, subsection (i), which is an absolute

2

prohibition on the use of the word "certified."

3

Subsection (i) does not give leeway for adding

4

disclaimers.

5

In addition, this case represents a separate

6

discipline.

So, even though the case of Peel v. Illinois

7

Regulatory Commission certainly applies to this case and

8

provides protection -- constitutional protection to the

9

speech in this case, it certainly goes beyond.

We're in

10

an era where many individuals and professionals seek

11

higher education, seek to better themselves for their own

12

reasons, but mostly so that they can offer additional

13

competence to the public.

14

QUESTION:

It - -

Ms. Ibanez, do I understand your

15

answer to Justice Kennedy to say that you - - you were

16

faced with a total prohibition, and there might not be any

17

controversy if the Board came back with something specific

18

- - you might agree with it and there might not be any

19

controversy?

20

Is that --

MS. IBANEZ:

Yes, Your Honor.

If I may clarify.

21

Because there are multiple licenses here, whether there

22

were two or three, if the threshold issue is, can the

23

State regulate an ad or restrict the CPA credential by

24

adding more information and more -- and a disclaimer,

25

certainly that is always a possibility and consistent with

However, to the extent that there are additional

licenses, to what point does -- at what point does it

begin to chill the speech?

5

add a disclaimer to each credential, or just the threshold

credential that the Board of Accountancy was trying to

clarify?

QUESTION:

If there are two credentials

But that remains hypothetical at this

10

point, because we don't have any specifics of what a

11

clarification might be.
MS. IBANEZ:

12

Yes, Your Honor, right now it is

hypothetical.

15

The Petitioner's speech is truthful.
It is non-coercive.

time and time again, it is the listeners' rights that we

are protecting here, not so much the speakers.

The public interest is well served by providing

disclosure of relevant information, to help potential

So, it is definitely directed to potential legal

Certainly, it is relevant to their

decision-making process in helping them choose a lawyer.
The Federal Trade Commission has a staff report

that we have cited in our brief regarding the additional

13

information disclosures that should be encouraged and not

14

censured when an attorney attempts to help in this

15

decision-making process that only benefits the marketplace

16

of ideas.

The Central Hudson test, which is a balancing

test well known and applied by this Court in the attorney

advertising cases, requires a balancing test.

of Edenfield v. Fane, this Court has reiterated that the

burden of providing substantial government interest in

3

certainly cannot be the word "certified" that does it.

4

So, the interest as to disclaimer and more

6

can the Board of Accounting -- could it have regulated in

a more reasonable way?

8

And, yes, a disclaimer to the CPA credential.

would have cured any possibility of potentially misleading

Is there a more reasonable fit?

effect regarding any of the other credentials.
QUESTION:

11

How could that -- how could that be?

12

What disclaimer attached to the CPA would make it clear

13

that the CFP is not a State credential?

MS. IBANEZ:

Justice Scalia, very simply, if

there is an asterisk to a CPA credential, not engaged in

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. IBANEZ:

Yes.
That would cure all misleading

effects.

Because the advertising rule says at subsection

20

(2), this only applies to public accounting advertising.

21

And this is attorney advertising.

22

would cure not only as to the CFP credential, but as to

None at all.

But the minute you have a

both.

So, you can -- you can accomplish

MRS. NELSON:

If in fact -- if in fact her

yes, that interest would be served.
