CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 92-1510, Michael Cavanaugh v. Gary Lee Roller.
Mr. Lundberg, Mr. Fairey, the Court would like

6

to hear a discussion of what mootness problems may be

7

raised by the statutory amendment that you have called to

8

our attention.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARL N. LUNDBERG
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11

QUESTION:

Mr. Lundberg, before you start, when

12

was the South Carolina statute passed, the statute that

13

raises this issue?

14

MR. LUNDBERG:

The statute was passed in June of

15

this year, but we didn't know about it, my colleagues and

16

I, nor the corrections community, nobody was aware of it

17

until Friday of this past week.

18

QUESTION:

Well, you come in here with a four

19

and a half month old statute and present it to us the eve

20

of argument.

21

South Carolina, do you?

22

MR. LUNDBERG:

You surely don't practice law that way in

No, Your Honor, but in South

23

Carolina this past legislative season we had a massive

24

restructuring of state government and we had a large

25

number of laws -- I have a copy on my desk that was the

earliest draft I could get of this classification bill,

2

and on the draft that I have it doesn't have this

3

provision in it.

4

find out how it got added, and it was added in the

5

conference committee but copies of the bill were not

6

available for us to see until the advance sheets came out.

7

We have checked up on that on Friday to

So I had no knowledge of it, although I had

8

looked at the draft that I had of the classification bill.

9

Mr. Fairey wasn't aware of it, nor was my co-counsel.

One

10

of our colleagues at the Attorney General's office had

11

gotten a copy of the advance sheets, had taken it home and

12

was reading it, and noticed that provision and the

13

application to this case and called.

14

QUESTION:

Other states I think have daily

15

legislative service that enable lawyers to keep up with

16

what is going on in the legislature.

17

awkward to have as old a statute as this come in here the

18

day before we argue.

19

MR. LUNDBERG:

It is a little

Yes, Your Honor, it was very

20

awkward for me too.

I made every effort to keep abreast

21

of this statute that was available to me at the time,

22

including computerized access at the legislation, but it

23

wasn't physically available for me to read.

24

unusual legislative year and I can't offer any other

25

explanation to that other than that we were diligent to

It was a very

keep up with this law.
QUESTION:

2

3

Now that you're here, is the 1983

aspect of this suit at least still alive?
MR. LUNDBERG:

4

Your Honor, it's our position

5

that until January 1 of 1994 all the issues are alive in

6

this case.

7

legislation goes into effect, it will then retroactively

8

on the one section make this case moot as to the

9

rescheduling of parole consideration hearings.

As of January 1 of 1994, when this new

But it is

10

live on the issue of whether or not the Ex Post Facto

11

Clause, today it is live on the issue of whether or not

12

the Ex Post Facto Clause applies to parole procedures and

13

the interval between parole consideration hearings in the

14

first place.

15

QUESTION:

I wonder how much of a practical

16

help -- chat is ordinarily a case that is argued in the

17

November arguments probably would not be decided until

18

after January 1 here, so that we're talking not just about

19

today, but we have to talk too about the possibility of

20

our Court not having finished its work on the case until

21

after the first of January.

22

MR. LUNDBERG:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

This

23

case is not one which I can say could not necessarily be

24

repeated because it involves the procedure involved in

25

paroling procedures in general, and so I assume that some

1

place along the line that a paroling procedure case could

2

again come up in front of this Court, but a case such as

3

this particular one might not be able to be raised and

4

therefore maybe mootness could be, wouldn't be an

5

objection to this Court making a decision on it.
QUESTION:

6

And that's our test, isn't it?

It

7

has to involve these particular parties, the possibility

8

of repetition, not just repetition of the issue against

9

the South Carolina authority?
MR. LUNDBERG:

10

That's true, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

and in addition, since there has been no publicity, no one

12

in the corrections field, no one in the probation field,

13

no one in the general public, as strange as it may seem,

14

has had an opportunity to be aware of this particular

15

piece of legislation, and now that the advance sheets are

16

out it may be that the general assembly will find some

17

concern about the effect of this legislation and it may be

18

that they will be altering the legislation in the near

19

future.

20

QUESTION:

May I ask, just to have a better

21

understanding, you mentioned the conference committee

22

apparently amended the legislation at the last minute.

23

Was the amendment to which you referred subsection (b),

24

subparagraph (b) of section 8, the one that says that it

25

refers to the time of commission of the crime?

1

MR. LUNDBERG:

No, Your Honor, the amendment

2

that I referred to was in the section that made it active,

3

that's section 266 that says that the retroactive effect

4

of l6-l-60(b), that that section will be retroactive.

5

law that came in had the amendment that brought in 16-1-

6

60(b) that changed the definition of a violent crime, the

7

offender to whom would be considered a violent offender.

8

But then the part that was stuck in was stuck in in 266 to

9

make that one specific section retroactive, where the rest

10

of the statute was prospective.

11

was unaware of, was the retroactive.

12

QUESTION:

The

That was the part that I

Is it possible in your view that the

13

purpose of doing that was to take care of this very

14

litigation because we had granted cert in the case, or at

15

least the Fourth Circuit had decided the issue?

16

MR. LUNDBERG:

I can't answer what's in the mind

17

of legislature, but I doubt very seriously that it was in

18

their mind or that they were even aware of it.

QUESTION:

I take it that in fact he has not had

a hearing this year?
MR. LUNDBERG:

That is correct, Your Honor.

He

has not had a hearing this year.
So, the questions that have been presented here

24

in this case for review are whether or not the change in

25

the interval between parole consideration hearings from 1

year to 2 years, which came after the respondent's crime,

2

violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, and whether or not the

3

respondent's claim is cognizable under section 1983

4

instead of under habeas corpus.

5

The change in an interval between a parole

6

consideration hearing from 1 year to 2 years does not

7

violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

8

part of procedure that is involved in the parole decision

making process.

The change involves a

In other words, in South Carolina this is

10

a change which is involved in a form of clemency in the

11

State of South Carolina.

12

QUESTION:

Would there be any limit of time to

13

the correctness of your statement if they decided, for

14

example, there would be a hearing only every 20 years?

15

Would that make any difference?

16

MR. LUNDBERG:

Under the proposition that I am

17

saying, I think that it would not make any difference

18

because if the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply, then

19

it would not make any difference in terms of an ex post

20

facto analysis of whether or not there was a hearing in 1

21

year or 20 years.

22

The Fourth Circuit's reasoning making the change

23

in the interval between parole consideration hearings a

24

violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause presents a large

25

number of other problems for a state such as South

size constitute a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause,

3

or would a change from a majority vote to a 2/3 majority

4

vote violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, or what about a

5

smaller change like from 21 months to 2 years violate the

6

Ex Post Facto Clause?

7

For example, would an increase in the board

It is my position that none of these changes,

8

including a change from 1 year to 2 years in the frequency

9

of parole consideration hearings violates the Ex Post

10
11

Facto Clause.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lundberg, suppose the statute,

12

suppose you had a statute that said anyone convicted of a

13

crime will be eligible for parole after 1 year, and then

14

the statute is amended to say that person will be eligible

15

for parole only after 10 years.

16

retroactively would that be a violation of the Ex Post

17

Facto Clause?

18

MR. LUNDBERG:

Would that be, if applied

Well, Your Honor, the position

19

that I am taking is that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not

20

apply to the scheduling between parole consideration

21

hearings, and the logical extension of that position is

22

that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to parole

eligibility period.

on from this Court is Collins v. Youngblood.

2

v. Youngblood this Court said, in reaffirming the Beazell

3

case, Beazell v. Ohio, that to the best of this Court's

4

understanding it correctly reflected the original

5

understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

6

understanding, as we all know, involves that you can't

make a crime that was, make an act which was innocent a

crime after the fact or increase the punishment or make

QUESTION:

Why doesn't this make the punishment

12

more burdensome when one is eligible for parole after a

13

period of time and later on he's not eligible.

14

a more burdensome punishment?

process does not change the sentence.

1

2

the state took the position that there was no violation.

3

QUESTION:

Would you go so far as to say that if

4

a state had, say a 30-year sentence for a particular crime

5

for everybody and at the end of 1/3 of the sentence the

6

person was eligible for parole and routinely parole was

7

granted, they then abolish parole entirely so that

8

everybody has to start serving their full 30-year

9

sentences, what would you say in that case?

10

MR. LUNDBERG:

Your Honor, I would say that the

11

sentence, if it were 30 years, remains 30 years, and the

12

fact that the situs of the service of the sentence might

13

change doesn't change the sentence.

14

doesn't change the sentence, and you have said that in

this Court on a couple of occasions.

mention in a parole guidelines case of Portley v. Grossman

17

where you said that the change in the paroling guidelines,

18

even though it kept the person in jail longer, that it did

19

not implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause and it wasn't a

20

violation of the Constitution.

Mr. Lundberg, do I understand

correctly that the South Carolina Supreme Court now agrees

You do understand correctly.

QUESTION:

1

And was the legislation, the recent

2

legislative change in South Carolina, responsive to the

3

South Carolina Supreme Court's decision?
MR. LUNDBERG:

4

No, it was not.

The legislation

5

took place in June, the decision of the South Carolina

6

Supreme Court took place in August, and the South Carolina

7

Supreme Court decision was based on no independent state

8

ground.

circuits had taken this position and so they followed the

they took to be the meaning of the U.S. Constitution based

20

it may be to believe, no one saw the legislative change

writing up of it.

QUESTION:

is exactly correct, they were not aware.
QUESTION:

2

3

Mr. Lundberg, do you have any comment

about Akins against Snow in the Eleventh Circuit?
MR. LUNDBERG:

4

Yes.

The Akins case v. Snow I

5

think has been, there are two problems with that.

One of

6

them is a question of whether or not the Ex Post Facto

7

Clause applies at all.

8

Akins case the Eleventh Circuit took the position that the

9

Georgia statute, the way it was written made the interval

The second problem is that in the

10

between parole considerations a part of parole

11

eligibility, and then took the position that the Ex Post

12

Facto Clause applies to parole eligibility and since the

13

Georgia statute intended to make the interval between

14

parole considerations a part of parole eligibility, that

15

it violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and they struck it

16

down.
The problem for all of these cases, the Snow

17
18

case, Akin v. Snow, and a large number of other cases is

19

that the circuits are not in agreement and there is

20

disagreement between the district courts and the circuit

21

courts, the courts of appeal, and between the courts of

22

appeal.

23

say whether or not the Ex Post Facto Clause applies at all

24

to these parole eligibility procedures, this problem would

25

be resolved and we wouldn't have these kinds of cases.

If this Court were to take a clear statement and

1

That's the position that I am taking here.
Another thing in the Collins case, in the

2

3

concurring opinion to the Collins case this Court set

4

forth a test that might be looked at to determine whether

5

or not a procedure actually violated or implicated the Ex

6

Post Facto Clause.

7

the procedure from the time when the act was committed,

8

and if that procedure changes the obtaining of a valid

9

conviction or sentence then the Ex Post Facto Clause is

That test is this, that you look at

10

implication.

From there the analysis would go to whether

11

or not there was a substantial disadvantage.
Well, when you do that, if you go back to the

12

13

time when the respondent committed his crime and you look

14

at the procedural change, the change in the frequency

15

between parole consideration hearings hasn't got anything

16

to do with obtaining a valid conviction or the sentence.

17

His sentence is not altered by whether or not he has

18

gained parole.

19

no expectation of parole.

20

that he says makes him go into 1983, is the fact that --

21

but he hasn't shown any entitlement to a fixed hearing

22

date.

23

He has -- in this state he has absolutely
That is part of his argument

There is no constitutional protection.
This Court said in the Greenholtz case,

24

Greenholtz v. the Inmates of Nebraska Penal Commission,

25

this Court said that there was no constitutional right nor

inherent right to be released conditionally prior to the

2

expiration of a sentence.

3

Court has taken all the way through, I have been unable to

4

find, nor have I seen anything cited in this case, in the

5

jurisprudence of this Court anything that is contrary that

6

in anyway would implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause in this

7

analysis.

QUESTION:

MR. LUNDBERG:

And so the position that this

How about Weaver against Graham?
Weaver against Graham was a,

10

although they used the term gain time, it was a good time

11

credit scheme.

12

person would be, his sentence would be shortened.

13

legislature replaced that scheme by putting in a

14

discretionary good time credit scheme, and even though the

15

amount of good time credit might have been greater under

16

the discretionary scheme it required affirmative acts on

17

the part of the inmate.

18

required no acts, and the result was that their sentence

19

in absolute terms would be shortened.

20

It involved an automatic scheme whereby a

So this Court held that the Ex Post Facto Clause

QUESTION:

It's an

Are you saying in effect that while

you're on parole in South Carolina you're still, you're

QUESTION:

There is no benefit to being

And it is a form of clemency.

Well, as a practical matter it's

12

certainly a benefit because you're able to walk around and

13

so forth rather than be confined.

14

MR. LUNDBERG:

I agree with that, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, but every change, every procedural change that

16

takes place, assuming that there was a violation, the Ex

17

Post Facto Clause was implicated, doesn't necessarily mean

18

that it's addressable or actionable.

19

is a case that makes that point, and there are others from

20

this Court that have made that point.

21

Dobbert v. Florida

So the threshold problem is whether or not the

22

Ex Post Facto Clause applies at all.

As a matter of fact,

2

they used the little case ex post facto rather than the Ex

Post Facto Clause usually used when referring to the

constitutional provisions.
So it is our position that while this case may

be moot or close to moot, it is done by the state and the

7

usual remedy applicable that the state has cited, the

Munsingwear case and the Los Angeles v. Davis case, is not

appropriate for this case.

That may be so when we're dealing

The usual remedy is to remand to the Fourth

never occurred, which obviously would have no precedential

effect if the South Carolina legislature were in February

QUESTION:

MR. FAIREY:

If you're going to take that

Our position is that a 1-year

change is just as violative of ex post facto as an 8-year

MR. FAIREY:

QUESTION:

Oh, yes.
And if they used to have them every 1

10

year by regulation but they decide that in the future

11

they're going to have them every 2 years, that's okay?
MR. FAIREY:

12

Justice Scalia, if they had no rule

13

and they left it completely to the discretion of the

14

parole board, then there would be no right to complain

15

because there would be no expectation and there would be

16

no increase.

17

QUESTION:

But the parole board has adopted a

18

rule, and you say changing the parole board's own rule

19

would not count for ex post facto purposes?
MR. FAIREY:

22

If that rule has the force of law

it would.

Of course it has the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARL N. LUNDBERG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LUNDBERG:

3

Thank you.

I'd like to make two

4

points.

It was said that parole is not a change in the

5

sentence and that parole is not a punishment.

6

said that parole resulted in a change of sentence by being

7

released and that it was, in effect changed the

8

punishment.

9

released on parole.

I think he

In South Carolina there is no right to be

It derives originally from the constitution

10
11

which gave the power to the governor to grant clemency and

12

to commute sentences, and that ultimately resolved into a

13

change in the constitution which then gave the power as a

14

form of clemency to the parole board.

15

but it was always an absolutely discretionary decision and

16

is still an absolutely discretionary decision.

Your position on the Munsingwear

vacation is that it ought to be vacated even though the

14

MR. LUNDBERG:

Yes.

Our position on that is

15

that the Munsing-wear requires there to be a vacation if

the case becomes moot before this decision is rendered and

that there's no other reason why the case wouldn't
