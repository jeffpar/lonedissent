ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS R. TROUT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. TROUT:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case requires the Court to determine

11
12

whether and under what circumstances it is appropriate for

13

a trial court to instruct the jury that in the event of a

14

not guilty solely by reason of insanity verdict, that the

15

accused will be committed to a mental hospital.

16

I will simply refer to the form of verdict as an NGI

17

verdict.

18

Hereafter

The case comes about because of the passage by

19

Congress in 1984 of the IDRA, the Insanity Defense Reform

20

Act of 1984.

21

the unfortunate events surrounding the assassination

22

attempt of President Reagan.

23

considering insanity defense reform for some time before

24

that, however, and this simply was the event that pushed

25

the Congress to agreement.

That Act was passed in part in reaction to

The Congress had been

Prior to the passage of that Act, the -- there

1

2

was no provision outside the District of Columbia for the

3

mandatory commitment of a defendant acquitted in a Federal

4

prosecution because of insanity.

5

not guilty by insanity verdict, as such; there was simply

6

the general verdicts guilty or not guilty.

In fact, there was no

7

The IDRA changed that, and prescribed a form of

8

verdict which is not guilty solely by reason of insanity.

9

The Congress, in adopting this law, modeled it closely on

10

the District of Columbia Act which, of course, also was a

11

congressional enactment.
QUESTION:

12

Mr. Trout, when you say Congress

13

modeled it closely on the District of Columbia Act, what

14

do you mean, that they looked to the District of Columbia

15

Act only?

16

MR. TROUT:

There's no evidence from the

17

legislative history that I can find, Your Honor, that they

18

looked anywhere else.

19

QUESTION:

Is there evidence is the legislative

20

history that they did look at the District of Columbia

21

Act?

22

MR. TROUT:

Yes, there's quite a bit of evidence

23

that they did.

24

comprehensive report in the legislative history about the

25

adoption of this Act, the -- reference to the D.C. Code

In the Senate Report, which is the most

provisions are quite numerous and throughout the report.
The Congress in particular paid close attention
to the disposition that was to be made of the accused in
the event he was found not guilty solely by reason of
insanity, and most closely modeled the IDRA on the D.C.
enactment with regard to that disposition.

I think that

is why it is so relevant to the issue that we have before
the Court today, because we are dealing with what happens
to the accused in the event he's found not guilty solely
by reason of insanity.
The D.C. Circuit has already held that the IDRA
was modeled on D.C. section 24-301 in the Crutchfield
case.

The Government, in its brief, did not deal with the

Crutchfield case whatsoever.

It did not mention it, it

did not try to point out any error in it, and I think it
incumbent on the Government today to at least respond to
the Crutchfield case and either admit that the holding in
that case is correct or else explain to the court where
the error in that case.
QUESTION:

What holding in the Crutchfield case,

Mr. Trout?
MR. TROUT:

The holding that the IDRA was

closely modeled on 24-301.
QUESTION:

Not the question involved in this

case, but the question of the derivation of the IDRA.

1

MR. TROUT:

2

If there is any question about whether the IDRA

3

was modeled on 24-301, I think it important to point out

4

the similarities, and especially with regard to the

5

disposition that's to be made of the accused in the event

6

of the not guilty by reason of insanity verdict.

7

^

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

It's true that the Congress made certain changes

8

in the -- between 24-301 and IDRA.

9

burden of proof from preponderance of the evidence to

They increased the

10

clear and convincing evidence.

11

burden had been placed on the defendant to prove the

12

defense.

13

increased it to clear and convincing.

In the D.C. statute the

They kept that burden on him; they simply

14

There were other minor changes that dealt with

15

the trial phase of a criminal case in which the insanity

16

defense is at issue, and all of those changes generally

17

are to increase the difficulty on the accused of

18

successfully asserting the defense.

19

is successfully asserted, then the IDRA and 24-301 are

20

very very similar.

21

QUESTION:

But once the defense

Was it the case that the D.C. courts

22

that imposed this requirement under the IDRA purported to

23

be imposing it because the statute required it, or was it

24

simply a part of their own supervision of the D.C. courts?

QUESTION:

It refers to the statute in the

Does it say that this requirement of

informing a jury is a statutory requirement?

5

MR. TROUT:

6

QUESTION:

No, it does not, Your Honor.
Ordinarily, you wouldn't expect the

7

legislative body that is enacting a provision governing a

8

criminal -- something to do with a criminal to say, you
know, what sort of instructions would be given, would you?

10
11

Don't they usually leave that up to the courts?
MR. TROUT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

I

12

think that it's difficult to think of congressional

13

enactments which prescribe for the court what instructions

14

they ought to give.

15

There may be, I'm not saying there are none, but it is

16

rare, if it ever happens, that Congress tells the courts

17

what instructions you ought to give --

18

QUESTION:

In fact, I -- none come to my mind.

But that's what you're urging here,

1

are you not, Mr. Trout, that you get this requirement that

20

the trial judge instruct the jury from the statute?

21

You're not making any constitutional argument, as I

22

understand it.

23
24
25

MR. TROUT:

No, I'm not making any

constitutional argument.
QUESTION:

So you -- you're pinning your

position about what the judge must charge to this IDRA
statute, is that right?
MR. TROUT:

Or to the supervisory power of this

Court to impose a -- the best rule.

In the event that the

Court does not find that the settled judicial construction
of 24-301 was, in fact, incorporated into the IDRA, then
the Court still has the power to require the instruction.
QUESTION:

Well, if you do -- if you're talking

about just some general supervisory power notion, then
wouldn't your reasoning apply as well to telling the jury
about a mandatory minimum sentence in a case.
MR. TROUT:
QUESTION:

No.
So they'll know the defendant's

exposure.
MR. TROUT:
QUESTION:
MR. TROUT:

No, Your Honor.
Distinguish -The diff -- I don't mean to

interrupt you, but -QUESTION:

Yes, distinguish the two, if it's a

question of the jury making an informed decision.
MR. TROUT:

Well, the difference is this.

The

jury has no role in sentencing and I'm not here to create
some -- urge some doctrine that would give the jury a role
in sentencing unless the legislature does it by some
congressional enactment.

The only point that I'm

1

advocating for is that the jury have the same knowledge

2

about the insanity defense, the same common knowledge that

3

it has about guilty and not guilty verdicts.

4
5

guilty verdicts mean the accused will be free if such a

6

verdict is rendered.

guilty verdict, he is at least subject to punishment,

but -- they don't know necessarily what that punishment

will be but they do know he can be punished.

Jurors come into the courtroom knowing that not

They also know that if they render a

With regard to the not guilty solely by reason

11

of insanity verdict, there is no certainty about what will

12

happened to an uninformed layman.

13

that the verdict says not guilty by reason of insanity,

14

and what happens to the defendant thereafter the jury has

15

no idea about.

16

He or she simply knows

And quite frequently we are dealing with accused

17

who are violent and at least -- at the very least are

18

disturbed mentally, and the public is concerned both about

19

violent individuals and mentally disturbed individuals.

20

And jurors may well feel compelled to convict under

21

circumstances where they would otherwise feel that the not

22

guilty by reason of insanity verdict was proper simply in

23

order to prevent the release of someone that they see as

24

potentially dangerous to the public.

jury, now, there is a requirement, if you return a verdict

2

of not guilty by reason of insanity, that this person go

3

to mental institutions -- a mental institution, but it is

4

possible that he could be released within 40 days, that

5

would be -- you would have no objection to such an

6

instruction.
MR. TROUT:

7
8

Well, I think that instruction is --

I do object to that instruction, Your Honor, because I
don't think it solves the problem that I am urging the

10

Court to correct.

I think the instruction ought to be

11

brief and it ought to be concise, but it should simply say

12

something like what the Sixth Circuit Pattern Instruction

13

says, which is:
"If you find the defendant not guilty because of

14
15

insanity, then it will be my duty to send him to a

16

suitable institution.

17

custody if he proves by clear and convincing evidence that

18

his release would not create a substantial risk that he

1

might injure someone or seriously damage someone's

20

property."

21

QUESTION:

He will only be released from

Well, that's the good side from the

22

point of view of your client, but if we're interested in

23

giving the truth a totally -- the jury a totally truthful,

24

accurate picture, why wouldn't one add what Justice

25

Ginsburg said, that there cold be a hearing in 40 days and

he might first -- that that would be his first opportunity

2

to be released.
MR. TROUT:

3

Mr. Chief Justice, we're not trying

4

to get the jury -- I'm not trying to get the jury involved

5

in what's going to happen to this man down the road -- or

6

woman -- other than to say, other than to assuage whatever

7

fears they have that they're going to release this man.
QUESTION:

Well, buy they're -- if he could be

released in 40 days, maybe some of those fears are
j ustified.
MR. TROUT:

Mr. Chief Justice, the Act is so

severe that --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TROUT:

Well what do you mean, severe?
I mean severe with regard to the

15

ability of an accused found not guilty solely by reason of

16

insanity to be released.

17

very difficult, if not impossible, in many cases for

18

anyone who successfully asserts this defense to

19

subsequently obtain release.

QUESTION:

MR. TROUT:

QUESTION:

It is very restrictive, and it's

So --

But you don't deny it's possible.
It's possible.
Well, it seems to me that you're just

picking and choosing the parts of the effect of this

verdict that would make a jury favor your client.

do is honor the time honored principle that the jury has

2

no role in the disposition of the accused, at the same

3

time that the jury is put on an equal footing that they're

4

already on with regard to the guilty and not guilty

verdicts.

speculate about whether the man will be released or not be

will -- it will solve some of the problems that the

10

And there -- I don't suggest that there's any

11

ideal solution to it, but I do believe it would be unwise

12

to get into the detail about what happens, because -- when

13

I say what happens, what happens in the event of his

14

acquittal on this ground and the subsequent commitment

procedures and release procedures.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Trout, is there a -- the D.C.

ago, I think, in the Lyles case.

MR. TROUT:

QUESTION:

Have they adopted a

Yes, sir.
You -- why did you read us the one

from the Sixth Circuit rather than that one, because the

Circuit cases.

Circuit Pattern Instruction in the appendix to my brief,

and - QUESTION:

How long has that pattern instruction

of them in here.

1972.

It's been amended slightly, but it's

And so the instruction is of long standing in the

D.C. Circuit, and it was in effect -QUESTION:

Is it a discretionary instruction

12

that the district judge gives, or is it always given if

13

the defendant asks for it, in the D.C. Circuit?

14

MR. TROUT:

In the D.C. Circuit it is always

15

given if the defendant asks for it, but if the defendant

16

does not want the instruction given, it is not given.

17

QUESTION:

Suppose the trial judge instructs the

18

jury, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you are not to

19

speculate upon the disposition of the -- or custody of the

20

defendant in the event you find him not guilty by reason

not your concern.

given, Justice Kennedy, I -- in every case, I believe.

that juries follow their instructions, and that is

2

necessarily a presumption that we have to engage in in

3

order for the criminal justice system to work.

4

simply give them that instruction with all the fear and

5

concern that jurors may feel about the accused in these

cases is expecting too much.

QUESTION:

But, to

the law has addressed this subject.

indicate -- many surveys do indicate that the public at

large is very suspicious of the insanity verdict.

and it's a loophole that criminals use to get through the

Must the court

the jury wants to think that, in fact, they're letting

them out too soon, must the court disabuse them of that

notion by withholding from them the information that this

person could be out within 40 days?

6

MR. TROUT:

If the public wants to think, if

Justice Scalia, the reason to give

the instruction, as I see it, is to have the jury

concentrate on the law and the evidence in the case, and
to -- and to bring in the 40-day requirement is a -- there

10

is some danger.

QUESTION:

MR. TROUT:

QUESTION:

Mr. Trout.
Yes.
I'm really puzzled by your argument

of the D.C. Circuit.

judicial construction which was placed on the D.C.

statute.

3

QUESTION:

Well, you said it wasn't.

You said

4

it wasn't a settled construction of the statute, I thought

5

you acknowledged that.
MR. TROUT:

6

7

QUESTION:

Well, it's not a construction of any

text in the statute, is it?

10
11

I did not acknowledge that.

It was very settled --

8

9

No, sir,

MR. TROUT:

No, sir, but it is a -- it's a

settled construction of the statute.

12

QUESTION:

Well, it's a settled practice in D.C.

13

when administering the statute, but as I understood your

14

answer, the D.C. Circuit did not purport to be construing

15

any language in the statute when it laid down the

16

instructional rule that you're asking for.

17

MR. TROUT:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

18

every decision is tied to the statute.

19

construing a word or a phrase in the statute, I confess

20

that, but it is tied to the statute and Congress knew

21

that.

it -- in fact, in the Senate Report it advocates the

23

practice of the instruction.

Now, they're not

asking the Court to adopt would require the model

instruction that Justice Stevens has referred to.

don't -- I personally don't think it is the best

instruction, but it is the instruction which the D.C.

for over 20 years, and it would certainly be a substantial

improvement over the present situation.

11

Now, petitioner seeks to rely on the familiar

12

canon of statutory construction that where Congress has

13

adopted a statute enacted in another jurisdiction and that

14

statute has received a settled judicial interpretation,

15

Congress must be deemed to have adopted that settled

16

interpretation along with the text.

17

Now, there are several reasons why that canon of

18

construction does not help petitioner in this case.

19

of all, the canon does not even apply here for the simple

20

reason, as Justice Scalia and Justice Souter have pointed

21

out, that the D.C. Circuit, in laying down the mandatory

rule of instruction in Lyles, was not engaging in

says a text should be given, but there -- the practice has
been in the District of Columbia to give this instruction,
as I understand it, for some years.
MS. WAX:
QUESTION:

Right.
Are you asking us to decide the case

in a way that will require the D.C. Circuit to change its
practice?
MS. WAX:

We are asking this Court to lay down a

supervisory principle, just setting aside the whole issue
of statutory construction.

We are recommending that this

Court, in its supervisory capacity, adopt the principle
that in general the instruction should not be given except
in the discretion of the trial court where there is
affirmative indication that the jury has been misled or
misunderstands the consequences of the verdict and may be
influenced.

MS. WAX:

I understand that's your position -So, in a way I'm saying, yes, we are

Yes, you do understand -- you, in

effect, are saying that that practice has been erroneous

MS. WAX:

Exactly.

The reason why the D.C.

14

Circuit has this rule as a rule applying to the D.C. Code

15

is that until 1973 the D.C. Circuit was the appellate

court for D.C. law as well as Federal law, and then there

QUESTION:

Suppose the jury sends a note to the

judge that says if we return an NGI verdict, will the

defendant walk.

4

so, how, under your supervisory principle?

5

Should the judge respond to that, and if

MS. WAX:

Well, I think under those

6

circumstances the judge could reasonably conclude that the

7

jury was tempted to abandon its responsibility or its

8

oath, that their -- that the system, so to speak, was not

9

functioning properly; that the jury was focused on

10

something that they weren't supposed to be focused on,

11

even to the point where they may harbor a misconception

12

about what would happen.

13

And that might be the type of circumstance in

14

which the judge should at least instruct the jury, again

15

quite sternly, that this was none of their concern, but

16

could perhaps go beyond that and issue a curative

17

instruction to perhaps clear up any possible misconception

18

about the disposition.

discretion?

12

some misleading statement by counsel to the effect that

13

had to be cured, but absent that it seems to me that your

answer is inconsistent.

15

What is to guide that

I assume one factor would be if there was

MS. WAX:

Well, no, if the jury says will the

16

defendant walk, will he be instantly released, that -- I

17

think the judge can think that that's somehow equivalent

18

to a prosecutor making the statement, and, by the way,

1

this defendant's going to walk, because it means that

20

there is this notion in their mind which is inaccurate.

21

When there's an inaccurate notion in the mind of the jury,

22

it is our belief that the judge need not just sternly

23

admonish them to ignore the consequences, but can actually

24

correct that misinformation.

then I could understand your response, but if all they ask

is what will happen, will he walk, I don't see that that's

MS. WAX:

That's a different question, and

Well, now we're getting into

10

subtleties.

Let me try and give an analogous example.

I

11

think that my response is in part a function of the great

12

deal of discretion that we give judges, district court

13

judges in issuing curative instructions, instructions

14

which try to correct misimpressions on the part of juries.

15

I mean, if a statement came out in the trial

16

about prior convictions; if, for example, a prosecutor

17

tried to insinuate than an individual had prior

18

convictions in a particular case, and it turned out he had

19

no prior convictions, I mean that was actually false,

20

we -- I don't believe that the judge would be confined to

21

just simply saying ignore that comment on the part of the

22

prosecutor, but he could go on from there and actually

give the proper information, correct the misinformation.

principles that govern our system, which is that we don't

consequences of verdicts, not just in the insanity context

the part of the judge; that it's not a desireable rule --

beauties of pattern instructions.

There's not any danger of error there;

That's one of the

wants, the instruction that he's requesting, is not really

No, but would you not agree that the

It is accurate, Your Honor.

instead of adhering to its oath and looking only to

2

evidence is not going to be influenced by this instruction

3

because this instruction provides no -- very little

4

reassurance to any jury that an individual who might be

5

dangerous is not going to be released.
A person will, at most, be held for 40 days,

6
7

and, in fact, he could be sprung as little as a few days

8

after the verdict because the hearing can be held at any

9

time within 40 days, and the person needs to show that he

10

isn't going to be dangerous to others and the property of

11

others, but that is a very different matter from a showing

12

that needs to be made to succeed in an insanity verdict,

13

which is --

14

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose that's the

15

defendant's choice to make if he has the option to ask for

16

the instruction.

17

MS. WAX:

But it's this Court's responsibility

18

to decide whether, in fact, it makes any sense to add yet

19

another requirement, another instruction, when that

20

instruction is out of keeping with the general -- our

21

paradigm, which is that juries look to the evidence, and

22

is just of marginal utility and in some cases may

23

backfire.

in which this sort of information might lead to -- the

kinds of situations in which the jury's attention being

brought to what's going to happen to the defendant might

lead them to render a less rather than a more accurate

position is there, that there is no requirement that the

judge give the charge.

to may the judge, if the judge -- in the judge's

discretion, give the charge.

14

I'm not clear yet on your answer

Say, for example, the judge has read a law

15

review article that says 80 percent of jurors don't know

16

what NGI means; they think it means that the defendant

17

will walk.

18

I want to tell them that that's wrong.

And the judge says, I'm impressed by that and

MS. WAX:

Well, I mean, that law review article

has yet to be produced.

Maybe at some point in the future

21

it might be produced and the land -- the whole landscape

22

that surrounds this particular issue will change.

23

of the pieces of information on which we base our position

24

in this case is that there simply is no good evidence;

25

it's purely speculative that jurors systematically

But one

misunderstand the law.
QUESTION:

2

Well, Ms. Wax, all that we have to do

3

in this case, I suppose, to satisfy your concern

4

immediately, is to say the statute doesn't require the

5

court to give the instruction.

6

MS. WAX:

7

QUESTION:

Right, that is one -- certainly one -We don't have a case here where the

8

judge has given an instruction and there's some objection

9

made, and perhaps we never will, but to decide this case

10

we only need to answer that one question, does the statute

11

require it, isn't that so?
MS. WAX:

12

That's certainly correct based on the

13

argument that petitioner has made, but we have made the

14

additional argument and we think that guidance might be

15

useful, although certainly not mandatory.

16

useful for this Court to lay down certain guidance for the

17

lower courts to follow, certain parameters.

18

QUESTION:

It might be

Ms. Wax, the first question presented

19

for review in the -- "Was the petitioner entitled to an

20

instruction that if he was found not guilty solely by

21

reason of insanity, he would be committed until he was no

22

longer a threat to the safety of others or their

23

property."

24

argument based entirely on the statute, but an argument

25

based on supervisory power too?

Don't you think that embraces not just an

1

MS. WAX:

It certainly can, Your Honor, and

2

that's why we have made a separate argument both in our

3

brief and are attempting to make one here, which is that

4

certainly even if the statute doesn't require this

5

instruction -- and certainly it doesn't require it -- that

6

there still is a further question of whether, as a

7

supervisory matter, this Court ought to have a certain

8

rule about what lower courts should do.

9

the Lyles case exemplifies a court of appeals deciding,

And I think that

10

you know, what ought to be the practice in its

11

jurisdiction.

12

And as a --

QUESTION:

Ms. Wax, if we reach that issue,

13

would it be your position that the instruction should

14

sometimes be given not only at a defendant's request, in

15

the case that you gave in your hypothesis, but at the

16

State's request as well?

17

MS. WAX:

QUESTION:

22

Yes, under appropriate circumstances.
What would the circumstances be in

which the State would be entitled to it?
MS. WAX:

one -- I'm having trouble thinking of circumstances.
QUESTION:

Well, what if we had Justice

23

Ginsburg's law review article on the bench again, wouldn't

the prosecutor be free to make the argument, Judge, the --

instruction?

Under our -- under our theory, I don't

think the prosecutor would be entitled to the instruction.

MS. WAX:

Because our view is that in the

case --

10

QUESTION:

11

wouldn't be enough.

12

MS. WAX:

13

QUESTION:

In other words the law review article

No.

That would be our view.

If the judge is giving the

14

instructions on not guilty by reason of insanity and the

15

jurors are shaking their heads and rolling their eyes, at

16

that point he can exercise discretion and tell them more?

17

MS. WAX:

sense that the jury --

of circumstances.

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

7

MS. WAX:

Would you say yes?

Well, I think that that is very

8

different from this case, and I haven't really thought

9

through what the State would be entitled to.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. WAX:

It is.
Yeah.

It is.
Because I think one of the

12

premises of this case is that the defendant is -- it is

13

the defendant who is, in effect, making, without making

14

it, a sort of quasi due process argument that it's

15

essential to the protection of their interest.

16

QUESTION:

Yeah, but we're now concerned with

17

supervisory authority, and if our criterion for exercising

18

supervisory authority is that the jury ought to have an

19

accurate sense of the consequences that will follow upon

20

the return of a given verdict, why doesn't the prosecutor

21

have just as good an argument for saying "he can walk in

22

40 days and I want them so instructed" as the defendant

23

has for an instruction "he can't walk tomorrow?"

24
25

MS. WAX:

Right.

Well, I think if there's been

an affirmative breakdown and indication that the jury has

really gone astray, I think probably the prosecutor could

get such an instruction.
QUESTION:

3

What if a jury in a criminal case

that has a number of counts, first degree murder, second

the jury thinks that manslaughter, the punishment for

have to know what the increment of punishment is for each
of the verdicts that it's going to bring in?
MS. WAX:

11

Well, you mean, if the jury says --

12

sends back a note and says we want to know what's going to

13

happen to this person's driver's license.

14

QUESTION:

15

MS. WAX:

Right.
Yeah, we're very concerned about this

person's driver's license.

8

Well, I think a line has to be drawn

somewhere.
QUESTION:

But it seems to me very odd, Ms. Wax,

9

that if you reserve this instruction for the jury that is

10

transgressing its authority, then they have the advantage

11

or the disadvantage of knowing the extra information.

12

seems to me your position should be that the more

13

unfocused the jury is becoming, the more the judge should

stick to the letter of the law and say, you must follow

Well, but I'm -- we're trying to

MS. WAX:

As in all cases where juries send back

6

notes asking specific questions or saying we're concerned

about this and they're not supposed to be concerned, or we

harbor this misconception that just simply isn't true, the

judge is going to have to make a judgment about how much

they need to tell the jury to get them back on track.

I don't think it's possible to lay down a blanket rule

That's

course unless the defendant actually objects to the

QUESTION:

And that's --

Ms. Wax, I suppose you have to be a

pretty stupid jury to think that you're given three
