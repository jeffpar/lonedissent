ORAL ARGUMENT OF MIGUEL A. ESTRADA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ESTRADA:

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Respondent was taken into custody on narcotics

10
11

charges by California sheriffs on a Friday afternoon in

12

August 1988 during the execution of a search warrant at

13

his home.

14

that Friday search, the State authorities contacted the

15

United States Secret Service on Monday morning.

16

Because counterfeit currency was found during

Respondent was questioned by Secret Service

17

agents late on Monday morning, and he admitted to

18

knowingly possessing the counterfeit currency.

19

Service agents then took him into custody on a Federal

20

counterfeiting charge.

21

booking respondent on that charge, the agents were

22

informed by the Clerk of the Federal Court that there was

23

no more room on the presentment calendar for the

24

magistrate that day, and were instructed to bring

25

respondent back before the magistrate on Tuesday.

The Secret

After writing a complaint and

That is

1

what they did.

The district --

3

QUESTION:

And there's nothing in the record, I

4

take it, to indicate that the State officers deliberately

5

delayed in calling the Federal people into the case.

6

MR. ESTRADA:

There's nothing in the record to

7

indicate that they were doing this any later than -- any

8

other way that they would otherwise have done, Justice

9

Kennedy, and there is no indication at all that anyone

10

waited over the weekend for any other reason than the fact

11

that it was the weekend.

12

The district court found respondent's confession

13

voluntary and admitted it at his trial.

Respondent was

14

convicted, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that

15

the confession should have been suppressed under 18 U.S.C.

16

section 3501.

17

Section 3501 has three subsections that are

18

relevant to the Ninth Circuit's analysis of the case.

19

Subsection (a) provides that if the trial judge finds that

20

if a confession was voluntarily made, she must admit it in

21

evidence, subsection (b) provides that in determining the

22

issue of voluntariness, the trial judge must considered

23

all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the

24

confession, including, among others, any delay in

25

presentment, and subsection (c) precludes the district

1

court from suppressing a confession solely because of

2

delay if the confession was voluntary and was made within

3

6 hours of the defendant's arrest.

4

The Ninth Circuit thought, or concluded, that

5

subsection (c) required suppression of respondent's

6

confession.

7

subsection (c) is that a confession made more than 6 hours

8

after the defendant's arrest may be suppressed solely

9

because of delay, even if it is voluntary and therefore

10
11
12

13

It reasoned that the negative implication of

mandatorily admissible under subsection (a).
QUESTION:

How did the Ninth Circuit majority

deal with subsection (a)?
MR. ESTRADA:

The Ninth Circuit indicated that

14

it had to, in effect, carve an exception to subsection (a)

15

in order to give meaning to the negative implication from

16

subsection (c), and in light of its conclusion that any

17

confession that falls outside of the 6-hour safe harbor

18

may be suppressed because of delay, the Court then went on

19

to hold that the confession in this case fell outside of

20

the 6-hour safe harbor because it was given more than

21

6 hours after the arrest by the California authorities on

22

Friday, rather than by the Federal authorities on Monday.

23

Now, in our view, the Ninth Circuit was wrong to

24

start the 6-hour clock running with the State arrest, and

25

in any event, the Ninth Circuit was wrong to conclude that

1

a negative implication from subsection (c) should override

2

an express affirmative statement in subsection (a).
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Estrada, if we were to decide

4

that the arrest or detention that starts the time clock

5

running is really only one involving Federal officials,

6

then does that end the case?

7

decide the meaning of the 6-hour limitation.
MR. ESTRADA:

8

We wouldn't then have to

That is right, Your Honor.

We can

9

win this case either by your holding that the 6-hour clock

10

starts ticking with the Federal detention, or by the Court

11

holding that the negative implication of subsection (c)

12

does not trump the affirmative statement of subsection

13

(a) .

14

QUESTION:

Now, do you concede that the

15

language, any law enforcement agency, can indeed refer to

16

State agencies in the event they are acting on behalf of

17

the Federal Government --

18

MR. ESTRADA:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, we do, Your Honor.

-- in making a Federal arrest?
We concede that there are many

21

circumstances in which State officers will enforce Federal

22

law under any set of circumstances, and in circumstances

23

when State officers are taking someone into custody for a

24

Federal crime, for example, or are acting for the Federal

25

agents rather than to enforce the State's own laws.

1

QUESTION:

But the arrest that triggers it has

2

to be one that gives rise to the need to take someone to a

3

Federal magistrate --

4

MR. ESTRADA:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. ESTRADA:

That is right.

-- is that your position?
The gist of our claim, of our view

7

in this case is that subsection (c) is directed to a

8

period of delay between the defendant's being taken into

9

custody for a Federal offense and his being taken in front

10
11
12

of a Federal magistrate under Rule 5(a).
That was the subject of this Court's supervisory
rule under the McNabb-Mailory line of cases, and is

3

actually how subsection (c) reads.

4

of delay in bringing the defendant before a magistrate

5

authorized to set bail for Federal offenses.

6

QUESTION:

Subsection (c) speaks

The trouble is that that limitation

7

would not allow in -- would not make the rule apply when

8

the State officers are acting as the cat's paw for the

9

Federal officers.

20

That is to say, so long as it's a genuine arrest

21

for a State crime, and there's no anticipation that he's

22

going to be drawn before a Federal magistrate, the Federal

23

officers can, working hand-in-glove with the State

24

officers, induce them to hold the prisoner for too long

25

without presenting him -7

MR. ESTRADA:

1

I agree that the -- that

2

subsection (c) would not apply in those circumstances, and

3

the reason for that would be that in the circumstances

4

that you have described, Justice Scalia, the State

5

officers would not in fact be acting as a cat's paw for

6

the Federal agents.

7

If the State officers are in fact acting to

8

enforce their own laws rather than serving merely as the

9

paw for the Federal agents -QUESTION:

10

Well, not merely.

I mean, in my

11

hypothetical, they are acting as the cat's paw of the

12

Federal officers for the purpose of getting a confession

13

to a Federal crime --

14

MR. ESTRADA:

15

QUESTION:

16

-- but the arrest is for a State

crime.

17
18

If --

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, if it is a bona fide State

arrest --

19

QUESTION:

Right.

20

MR. ESTRADA:

-- and there are questions of

21

mixed motive everywhere in the law, but if in fact when

22

you deal with it on those terms you find that there was in

23

fact a bona fide crime, and a bona fide State arrest, I

24

would agree with you, and I think that that is in fact a

25

desirable result, because one of the things that we want

1

to do as a policy matter is to encourage cooperation

2

between law enforcement officers in States with the

3

Federal Government.

4

It is only when the action is to evade, and only

5

to evade, the requirements of Rule 5(a) that we think it

6

is appropriate to consider the fact that the defendant has

7

been taken into custody as the act of the Federal

8

Government, and in making that point, we point not only to

9

the text of subsection (c) that, of course, speaks to

10

delay in bringing the defendant in front of a Federal

11

judge, but also to the history and the background that

12

preceded the statute.

13

Under any view of the legislative history,

14

section 3501 was intended at least to limit and narrow the

15

McNabb-Mallory rule.

16

any view, to limit and narrow.

17

case law before this statute that said that State arrests

18

would not be considered Federal for these purposes unless

19

the defendant affirmatively demonstrated that the Federal

20

agents in effect used the State as a cat's paw to evade

21

Rule 5, and --

22

23

QUESTION:

We say overrule, but at least

under

There was a background of

Can you give us an example of what,

in your estimation, would be a cat's paw case?

24

MR. ESTRADA:

25

QUESTION:

Sure.

It isn't the one that Justice Scalia

1

gave.
MR. ESTRADA:

2

No.

It is a case in which there

3

is no law enforcement interest for the State in taking the

4

person into custody, a case like, for example, Anderson,

5

in which there might have been some State law enforcement

6

interest, but it's clear from the facts that that is in

7

fact not what is going on, or a case in which the conduct

8

at issue is not even a crime under State law, and

9

nonetheless the person is picked up solely at the instance

10

of the Federal officers to allow the officers a period of

11

time to question the defendant without complying with

12

Rule 5(a).
So one of the examples is a case in which there

13
14

is in fact no law that allows the State to do what it is

15

doing, so there is in fact a clear inference, hopefully

16

supported by other facts, that all that is going on is

17

that the Federal agents are using the State to do their

18

bidding.

19

QUESTION:

That would be a fairly rare

20

situation, would it not, that the State police arrest

21

someone when there's no basis under State law for

22

arresting them?

23

MR. ESTRADA:

We hoped that that would be so,

24

Mr. Chief Justice.

I think that that is the view that the

25

Second Circuit took of your case Anderson in the Coppola

1

case.

2

Coppola as being the case that I just -- the Second

3

Circuit read Anderson, excuse me, as being the case that I

4

just posited to Justice Ginsburg and this Court affirmed,

5

so yes, while that would be a rare circumstance, we're not

6

saying that this is something that does happen or indeed

7

should happen any more frequently than that.
QUESTION:

8

9

I mean, that is to say the Second Circuit read

Mr. Estrada, I should know the answer

to this question, but I don't.

Are most State officials,

10

or officials in most States empowered to make an arrest if

11

they see a Federal -- if they become aware of a Federal

12

offense being committed in their presence or what-not,

13

even though there is no State offense implicated in the

14

action?

15

MR. ESTRADA:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, and those --

So on your test, there would still be

17

a State interest, I take it, if they made that kind of an

18

arrest and said, you know, we're just going to hold him

19

for the Feds.

20

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes, but in that case the clock

21

would start ticking from the point when they took it upon

22

themselves solely to enforce Federal law, and we're not

23

asking that --

24
25

QUESTION:

So there's a case in which it

wouldn't be a -- I guess it wouldn't be the classic cat's

1

paw, but the clock would still start running at the moment

2

of the arrest.
MR. ESTRADA:

3

Sure.

I mean, we're not saying

4

that the only case in which we get tagged with the conduct

5

of the State is a case in which we have wilfully procured

6

the State.

7

circumstances in which State officers would undertake to

8

enforce Federal law, and we would want them to do so, but

9

if that is all they're doing, once they have taken on the

We do recognize that there are many

10

burden to enforce Federal law, they have to comply with

11

Federal law throughout, including Rule 5(a), so that if a

12

State officer, as we say in our brief, stops me and finds

13

out that I have a Federal warrant out for -- for my

14

arrest, but that there's nothing wrong with my car, or

15

there is no other State reason to hold me, if he exercises

16

his right to take me into custody on the basis of the fact

17

that I have a Federal warrant, he has to comply with

18

Federal law and take me to a judge under Rule 5(a).

19

certainly not saying that the only circumstance that gives

20

rise to the State conduct being tagged to us is the

21

typical cat's paw.
QUESTION:

Does he take them -- you say he takes

23

them to a judge's -- he's arrested -- he's a State

officer.

crime.

He's arrested him for a Federal

He takes him to a Federal judge?
MR. ESTRADA:

3

Yes.

Yes, Justice Scalia.

If he

4

wants to take someone into custody for a -- for a Federal

5

crime, he has to take all of the duties that come with

6

taking somebody into custody by -- for a Federal crime,

7

and those include taking him in front of a Federal judge

8

under Rule 5(a).
It may be that he's ignorant of those, but if in

9
10

fact he was undertaking to further the Federal interest

11

and fails to see to it through to the end by taking him to

12

the judge, we see nothing unfair in our being tagged with

3
4
5
6

that time.
QUESTION:

Does this happen, you have State

officers coming before Federal magistrates regularly?
MR. ESTRADA:

Sometimes.

Not frequently.

The

7

text of Rule 5, if I recall, actually speaks of a person

8

making an arrest, rather than a Federal agent making an

9

arrest, and it contemplates a broad range of possible

20

instances of conduct, including the old notion of a

21

citizen's arrest, for example.

22

QUESTION:

What if a State officer arrests

23

somebody for both State and Federal offenses?

24

have to come before a State magistrate for the State

25

offenses and a Federal magistrate for the Federal offense?

Does he

1

MR. ESTRADA:

Well, I think, under our view, if

2

he takes someone into custody for a State offense, his

3

duty is to his employer, and he does that first, and

4

anyone who then wants to go in and charge the person with

5

a Federal offense would have to take -- to go into the

6

State's domain, as it were, take him into custody, and

7

take him to a Federal judge, but we would not consider

8

that a Federal arrest, even though it is a mixed motive

9

type situation.

10

Because if there is in fact good reason for

11

holding the person under State law and that reason is

12

intended to be acted on by the State officer, we haven't

13

yet come to the point where we think of the employees of

14

the State as being there solely for the purpose of doing

15

our bidding, and we understand that they have to comply

16

with State law, and that that's all that they should be

17

expected to do.

18

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question?

In your

19

reference to Rule 5(a), it refers to an officer making an

20

arrest under a warrant, and you say that would include a

21

State officer, I gather.

22

MR. ESTRADA:

23

QUESTION:

I would think so, Justice Stevens.

But in the rule -- in 18 U.S.C.

24

3501(c), when it refers to custody of any law enforcement

25

officer, you think that means just Federal officer?

MR. ESTRADA:

1
2

We think that in subsection

(c) it could be a state officer --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. ESTRADA:

5

No.

Oh, I see.
But because of the context, only

when acting to enforce Federal law.

6

QUESTION:

I see.

7

MR. ESTRADA:

Our point is that if a State

8

officer undertakes to take someone into custody for a

9

Federal crime, he is enforcing State law, and he falls

10

under the terms of subsection (c) and starts the 6-hour

11

clock running.
Of course, the prerequisite for that is that he

12

3

be enforcing Federal law, because we think that even

4

though the section doesn't limit the identity of the

5

officer who acts, it does limit the subject matter of what

6

he's acting on, and by highlighting delay, and since one

7

can rarely be late for any sort of appointment one hasn't

8

made, the statute very clearly indicates that is making

9

reference to an event that gives rise to a duty to take

20

someone in front of a Federal judge and, in our view, that

21

is only an arrest for a Federal crime, and as we say, that

22

is also consistent with the historical background of the

23

rule.

24
25

As to our second point, even if it were true
that an arrest for a State offense starts the 6-our clock

running, we think it would be wrong to conclude that a

2

confession made more than 6 hours after the arrest

3

necessarily must be suppressed.

4

safe harbors that if your ship wanders out of one of them

5

it is automatically sunk.

6

It is not the case with

Subsection (c) says that suppression is

7

precluded if the confession is voluntary and made within 6

8

hours of delay -- made within 6 hours of the arrest,

9

excuse me, solely on the basis of delay, but it says

10

nothing about any confessions, and we think that those are

11

left to generally applicable principles of law, including

12

subsection (a), which mandates that all voluntary

13

confessions must be admitted.

14

QUESTION:

If a confession --

15

QUESTION:

I don't --

16

QUESTION:

-- is made within 6 hours, but there

17

is a charge of involuntariness, is time a factor that the

18

judge may consider?

19

MR. ESTRADA:

Yes.

Under subsection (b), as we

20

read the three subsections, subsection (a) says that the

21

sole test is voluntariness.

22

consider delay as one factor, and subsection (c) in

23

effect, even though it is somewhat complicated, we

24

concede, says that in determining subsection -- the

25

question under subsection (b), the court should not let

QUESTION:

3

Well, it really doesn't say that.

I

4

don't see how (c) is a safe -- maybe you can explain how

5

(c) can be a safe harbor when it's only made a safe harbor

6

if the confession is voluntary.

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

Well --

And the confession isn't voluntary if

one of the problems with it is that there was too much

time elapsing between arrest and arraignment.

11

how you ever get to -- it's perfectly circular.

12

is.

13

MR. ESTRADA:

I don't see
It really

There is no seamless way of

14

construing this statute, Justice Scalia, and we recognize

15

that.

16

that one could say about subsection (c) than what you just

17

said, but in order to make it fit better with the balance

18

of the statute, what we do, quite candidly, is to read

19

subsection (c) as if it said, and it otherwise can be --

I think that there are many less charitable things

MR. ESTRADA:

Which I think is consistent with

22

what Congress was trying to get at, and in that connection

I should point out that the clause, if it is voluntary,

24

was in the bill that came out of committee and went onto

25

the floor, so that to the extent that every party in front

of the court concedes that that bill was designed to do

away with the McNabb-Mailory rule for good --

about -MR. ESTRADA:

Well, Justice Scalia, you asked me

the last question, and I'm hoping that he won't ask any.

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. ESTRADA:

No, but to the extent, Justice

12

Scalia, and Justice Stevens, that every party before the

13

Court concedes that the bill that came out of committee

14

was clearly intended to do away with McNabb-Mallory for

15

good, the structural problems with the bill were already

16

present at the time that the bill came onto the floor, and

17

in fact, with Senator Scott's change on the floor, it

18

makes a little bit more sense now than it did as it came

19

out of the committee.

20

Conceding that the prose of subsection (c) is

21

less than what might be called limpid, the key in trying

22

to get an understanding of what Congress was trying to do,

23

we think, is to -- is to understand that from the outset,

24

the subsection that was carrying all of the water to

25

overrule McNabb-Mallory was subsection (a) and not

subsection (c).
Subsection (a) -- excuse me -- said, if it is

voluntary, you must let it in.

consider delay.

5

keep judges from overvaluing or overrating delay in making

6

the judgment in (b), or in (b)(1), and once you understand

7

that subsection (c) was related to the McNabb-Mallory

8

problem but was not -- but that it was not itself the

9

vehicle for overruling McNabb-Mallory, one sees what the

10
11

Subsection (b) says,

Subsection (c) in effect is a tool to

problem that Senator Scott has with it.
As it came out onto the floor, it said, you may

12

not consider delay as the tipping factor, or as the one

13

factor that would make something involuntary, ever.

14

point is, I can think of cases in which, if you have an

15

extremely long delay, that factor will be the factor that

16

will make a confession involuntary.

17

His

What we do is, we put a limit on subsection (c)

18

to say that after a period of 6 hours, a district judge is

19

free to consider delay as a factor, as a full factor, and

20

maybe even as the principal factor.

21

Is it elegant?

No, but we do think that it

22

makes sense out of every subsection of the statute to the

23

extent that the statute can be made sense of.

Now -- and one of the things that we point to in
giving that construction to the subsection is the

overriding impetus for every subsection of the statute.

2

If you step back and look at the statute, what the statute

3

in effect says is, don't suppress because of X, don't

4

suppress because of Y, don't suppress because of Z, and

5

one has to work really hard with the language of the

statute and practically ignore all of the legislative

history in order to get out of the statute a rule that

says, suppress, and by the way, it's mandatory, and that

is our sole point as to subsection (c).

If there are no further questions, I would like
to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
QUESTION:

I just want to -- perhaps you did

13

cover this with Justice O'Connor, but you -- really in

14

your cert petition you raised one question, which was the

question about the State custody, as I understand it, and

it is your position if we answer that question in your

I will start, perhaps, by addressing the time

focused on that.

4

Government's argument, Your Honors, is it basically does

have to insert that word that it basically suggested

inserting into subsection (c).

the word "otherwise" in front of "voluntary" to make it

Worse, Your Honors, it seems to me that that

then creates an impossible scenario for a court to have to

11

engage in. Voluntariness is a case-specific inquiry.

12

can you inquire into something, whether something is

out, and have a court inquire into whether it would have

fact that defendant's will is overborne is not probable

1

Well, how do you read section (c)?

What does it mean to you?

under your analysis, right?
MR. GUNN:

It does nothing at all, then,

Well, no, I think it does do

something, Your Honor.

6

language that I think fairly clearly, as clearly as you

7

can get anything out of this statute, established that it

8

retains a limited McNabb-Mallory type rule.
One, they refer -- they use the word -- they

talk about inadmissibility, not involuntariness.
Second, they use the word, solely because of

There's three aspects of the plain

delay.

They don't talk about because of delay that makes

a confession involuntary.
Third, Your Honor and this, I think, makes the

just a negative implication statue.

subsection.

The "provided"

They are saying this is an affirmative

limitation on something, and what they're saying, in

essence, is that this is a time limitation on the period

of interrogation, which is exactly -- I know the Court

QUESTION:

Mr. Gunn --

MR. GUNN:

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

-- you say the Government does

violence to subsection (c) in its interpretation.

7

8

get where you're going.
MR. GUNN:

You

You have to read an excep -- you have

10

to read subsection (c) as a specific statute that controls

11

over and creates an exception to the general in subsection

12

(a) .

13

But Your Honor, I'd ask the Court to consider, I

14

think the Government has to concede there's at least some

15

exceptions to the literal language in subsection (a)

16

anyway.

17

Government I assume would concede that the confession, to

18

be admissible, has to be relevant.

have to concede that its literal language is limited by

2

the rules of evidence, for example.

3

more sense to concede that it's limited by the language of

a subsection in the very same section.
QUESTION:

5

Then it makes even

Well, I think you have some

6

difficulty with that point, when you have a statute that's

7

addressed to the McNabb-Mallory rule and it's talking

8

about admissibility for delay under various circuits.

9

have one categorical statement, and it does seem to me

You

10

categorical, notwithstanding the fact you say there would

11

have to be an exception, that it shall be admissible, and

12

you're saying that is going to be limited by what comes

13

after.

14

you're having to take liberties with the statute the same

15

way the Government does.

16

I'm not saying that's totally unreasonable, but

MR. GUNN:

We're having to treat subsection (c)

17

as a more specific statute that creates a limitation to

18

the general in subsection (a).

19

more sense, Your Honor, to find a limitation within the

20

very same statute, than it does to have to reach outside

21

to other rules of evidence and so on, so -- but you're

22

right, Your Honor, there is definitely a tension, albeit

23

perhaps even an inconsistency, between subsection (a) and

24

subsection (c), but under our interpretation, subsection

25

(a) still has an impact and still has some meaning.

Under the Government's interpretation, unless

you insert a totally new word,

engage in this hypothetical fact-specific discussion,

under their approach subsection (c), the phrase "if the

QUESTION:

Would your construction require the

exclusion of any statements that would have been

voluntariness, Your Honor.

read the pre-3501 case law in this working arrangement

very significant problems with the Government's position

1

apply it in the situation where there's a State

2

arraignment, because the delay there would at least

3

generally be caused by the State court's need to have the

4

person first and process him.
So it wouldn't be delay that was caused by the

5
6

officers, and I think you can construe this statute in

7

context to refer to delay caused by law enforcement

8

officers, not delay caused by the courts.
QUESTION:

What would be the policy virtue of

Presumably the purpose of the rule is to deter

Federal officers from extended delay that might lead to

12

putatively coerced confessions.

the sole purpose of the law.

broader than that.

Then you don't have to inquire when a defendant

purposes that applies as much, frankly, to innocent

QUESTION:

If we go back to I guess what is

MR. GUNN:

-- it's the phrase "arrest or other

3

detention in the custody of any law enforcement officer or

4

agency."

I think you're right, Your Honor.

5

But those purposes, the purposes -- the purposes

6

underlying this statute of getting people to court quickly

7

and the purposes that were spoken about by the Congressmen

8

during the debate, you don't have any contact with family

9

or friends while you're detained incommunicado before

10

going to court.

11

don't have a chance to have a magistrate consider whether

there's probable cause.

14

You don't have a chance to get bail.

You

You don't have counsel to start

All those purposes, all those goals are advanced

15

just as much by a statute that encourages State officers

16

who are helping Federal officers to contact the Federal

17

officers quickly, so I think in terms of the purposes and

18

policies underlying this statute, Your Honor, that those

19

are advanced by focusing on State officers as well as

20

Federal officers, and the much more workable rule, the

21

much better in context reading, I would submit, is to

22

focus on the type of arraignments, or the type of charge.

23

QUESTION:

Then how would your interpretation of

24

the rule resolve the question where the State officer

arrests on a State law bankrupt -- bank robbery charge,

MR. GUNN:

I think, Your Honor, in that case it

would depend on whether he's arraigned on the bank --

Well, you may have a statutory

your solution commends itself by reason of its simplicity.
MR. GUNN:

Well, Your Honor, there's three

10

possible situations that would arise factually.

One would

11

be where there's only a State arraignment, one would be

12

where there's only a Federal arraignment, and one would be

13

where there's both.

14

Under my approach, if there's only a Federal

15

arraignment the statute applies from the time of State

arrest.

17

does not apply.

May I give you a hypothetical and see

what -- what if a State officer arrests a man in

possession of a stolen car, and after he's in State

They find the car has crossed the State line, so

11
12

they call in a Federal officer and say you can question

him if you want, and the Federal officer questions him,

gets a confession, but in the meantime the State decides

to prosecute and they keep him in jail for 6 or 8 months,

and then at the expiration of that period the Federal

Your Honor, I think that's a

difficult question that I was suggesting to Justice

"delay" in the statute.
A reasonable construction would be to construe

3

it only as delay caused by law enforcement officers, and I

think in the hypothetical Your Honor just suggested, the

delay would really be a result of the State court system

and State authorities wanting to and having an interest in

prosecuting the defendant.

You don't

But the other approach, if you're worried about

9
10

the policy implications of that, is to construe -- I think

11

the delay in that case could properly be considered to be,

12

or attributed as delay due to the State courts and State

13

prosecution situation, and then the delay would not be

14

delay attributable to law enforcement officers, and I

15

think you can read this statute in context to focus on

delay attributable to law enforcement officers, and that's

certainly the overriding purpose, is delay that they

caused, not delay that the courts caused by their

there's also a concern, if you draw this line between

The Ninth Circuit

just relied on longstanding Ninth Circuit case law that

said State custody is included, and I've looked back in

the history of the statute for that, and I haven't found

carefully.

really don't analyze the issue very carefully, either.

that when a person is taken into custody by an outside

Under the Government's interpretation of the

statute, 350 (c) doesn't apply, and you create --by

construing the statute to eliminate State custody, you

create a situation where that sort of thing can happen,

Isn't it true, though, that there may

be a fair number of cases in which a person is in State

the opportunity to interrogate if the DEA was negligent or

lax in contacting them promptly, but that's an arrest by a

always going to have that situation where you want a

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Only a couple of points.
First, the concession that counsel read in our

14

15

at the cert stage, and we merely repeated it in our reply

16

brief on the merits because he made the same argument in

his brief on the merits that he made in his opposition.

18

At page 1 through 2 of our reply brief on the

1

cert stage, we deal with his argument of any law

20

enforcement officer with the following:

21

"That claim, however, is irrelevant to our

22

submission.

We do not content that arrests by State

23

officers cannot qualify under section 3501(c).

24

contention, instead, is that the arrest, whether by

That is from our reply brief at the petition

stage.
Our second point is that the basis for a person
having been taken into custody is often litigated in State

10

and Federal courts, because claims that the arrest was

11

made without probable cause are a means for seeking the

12

suppression of physical evidence seized at the time the

13

person was taken into custody, and as a result of that, as

14
