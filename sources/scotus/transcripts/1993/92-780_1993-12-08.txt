MS. CLAYTON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may

it please the Court:
QUESTION:

Ms. Clayton, before you start, could

I ask precisely whom you represent here?
MS. CLAYTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

I represent the

14

National Organization for Women in its capacity as a

15

representative of its female members who might use the

16

clinic service -- the clinic services, and not in it's own

17

capacity on the RICO claim.

18

individual capacity on the antitrust, which may have given

19

some confusion.

20

We did have NOW in its

Of course, in addition I also represent the

21

clinics, Delaware Women's Health Center and Summit, who

22

have standing in their own right and who also represent a

23

class of all similarly situated clinics.

MS. CLAYTON:

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

And

The clinics, of

Your Honors, this case involves forcible violent

8

conduct by a highly structured enterprise called PLAN, an

9

enterprise with a very clearly defined goal, to force

10

every women's health center that offers abortion out of

11

business by whatever means are necessary, including

12

terrorist tactics.

13

Our case arises under RICO, which doesn't say a

14

word about economic motive, and the question before this

15

Court is whether to apply the statute that Congress wrote

16

or amend it judicially to add this unstated requirement.

17

I'd like to discuss three points this morning.

18

First, that the text and structure of RICO do not allow

19

for an economic motive requirement.

20

the statute as Congress wrote it easily comports with the

21

First Amendment.

22

requirement would be bad policy in any event.

23

Second, that to apply

And third, that an economic motive

Starting with the text, we bring our case under

24

section 1962(c) of RICO, which doesn't mention economic

25

motive, and neither do the two terms where the lower court

claimed to find this requirement.

Both "racketeering

2

activity" and "enterprise" are terms that Congress

3

expressly defined.

4

called broad.

They're terms that this Court has

And in the Sedima case, this Court pointed out

5
6

that "racketeering activity" consists of the commission of

7

the predicate acts, no more and no less.

8

Court recognized that this generous definition would

9

purposefully attract a broad array of perpetrators.

And in H.J. the

We know that Congress did not want to limit

10
11

racketeering activity to only those crimes that were

12

economically motivated, because when Congress chose the

13

30-some-odd crimes to include in RICO as the predicate

14

acts, it included numerous crimes that have no necessary

15

relation to money at all.

16

four, arson, kidnap, and murder, have no necessary

17

relation to money.

18

less a crime if it's committed for some other reason like

19

power, hatred, or revenge.

MS. CLAYTON:

situation then, Your Honor.

the case and you had this same what you call definition in

1 61(4), suppose it read,

11

any individual partnership, corporation, association, and

12

enterprise seems a little inconsistent with associations,

2

in fact which, as this Court pointed out, is an

3

unambiguous term.

The Court has said that.

The predecessor draft of RICO did use -- one of

4
5

the predecessor drafts, in fact three of them used the

6

term "business enterprise."

7

I think that would have been confusing; they used it as

part of the statutory text.

My point is that if you believe that

"enterprise" means the same thing as "business enterprise"

16

17

thing -- you acknowledge by what you've just said that

of it.

Your Honor, I do not concede that

The argument was meant - - the argument was made

3

that the enterprise definition meant only legitimate

enterprises, but this Court said if Congress had wanted to

limit the statute to only legitimate enterprises, it could

statute itself or the definition, Justice Scalia, it

actually dropped that term.

Here not only did Congress not

And that shows, one, that

10

Congress knows how to use the words when it wants to limit

remember that RICO does have one requirement.

It requires

And by the way, Justice Stevens, that economic

9

effect is something that even the lower court recognized

10

we unquestionably have, because this nationwide campaign

11

of terror has caused and continues to cause enormous

12

business and property damages to our plaintiffs.
Another reason that we should not infer an

13
14

economic motive requirement into a statute that is totally

15

devoid of one is RICO'S liberal construction clause.

16

clause shows that Congress purposefully chose breadth over

narrow constructions.

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

21

MR. ESTRADA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
For three reasons, RICO does not require a

22

prosecutor or a plaintiff to prove an economic motive.

23

First, there is no textual basis for such a requirement.

24

Second, this Court has already rejected similar nontextual

25

limitations on the scope of RICO which were also claimed

1

to derive from Congress' purpose in passing the statute.

2

And third, the economic motive requirement is elusive and

3

really has little to do with the societal effects of

4

systematic ongoing crime, which is what the statute is

5

about.

6

As to our first point, the respondents in this

7

Court have not identified the single one textual home of

8

the economic doctrine.
QUESTION:

9
10

Just -- but Justice Scalia just did.

What do you say about the word "enterprise?"
MR. ESTRADA:

11

The word "enterprise," Justice

12

Stevens, is defined by statute, and it is not new to this

13

Court.

14

this doctrine really comes from the Ivic case in the

15

Second Circuit, where the Government tried to use the

16

statute to prosecute terrorism in New York City.

17

that case, the Court did point to that word as a -- as a

18

basis for the doctrine.

The notion that the word "enterprise" can include

There is practically no

And the failure of the enterprise element to

11

give content to this doctrine I think is not only

12

demonstrated by what the Court said in the Turkette case,

13

but also by what the Second Circuit itself did with the

14

doctrine 3 months later in the Bagaric case.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

What did Turkette say about

enterprise?
MR. ESTRADA:

The Court in that case noted that

18

the definition by Congress is very broad, and it certainly

19

includes any entity or group of individuals associated in

20

fact, which, the Court noted, includes any group that

21

associates for a common purpose.

about what the nature of that purpose must be, and that's

all the Court said.

element would really cripple the role that Congress

2

thought RICO would play.

3

of RICO Government entities, courts, nonprofit

4

organizations, all of which have uniformly been recognized

5

by the lower courts to be RICO enterprises, and which even

6

Respondent Scheidler, I think, at page 14 of his brief

7

concedes are RICO enterprises.
In addition, one of this Court's cases, the

8

9

It would take out of the reach

H.J., Inc. case, had a Government agency as a claimed RICO

10

enterprise, and that certainly gave no pause to the Court

11

in ruling that the complaint in that case was sufficient.

12

Now - -

13

QUESTION:

How do you - - how do you, Mr.

14

Estrada, explain our more limited scope accorded to the

15

Sherman Act?

16

MR. ESTRADA:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Well --

Not expanding that to the limit of

the meaning of its words.
MR. ESTRADA:

Well, there is a difference in the

20

Sherman Act, Justice Scalia, in that it really does tend

21

to make unlawful things that in the absence of the act

22

could be done lawfully.

23

it starts with conduct that is already criminal.

24

while Congress said that as to the civil side of RICO, it

25

was looking to the antitrust model, this Court has

And

1

recognized that that is not a model that the Court should

2

follow in all contexts.

3

For example, in the Sedima case a claim was made

4

that based on the antitrust laws which called for some

5

form of antitrust injury, there should be a requirement in

6

RICO that there be racketeering injury.

7

turned down that argument, saying that racketeering

8

activity is nothing more and nothing less than the

9

commission of the predicate crimes.

10

And this Court

Thus while Congress did have the antitrust model

11

of civil damages in mind, I don't think this Court has

12

ever ruled that it - - that every aspect of RICO is ruled

13

by what Congress has done in the antitrust areas.

similar to some extent, but they're not identical.

isn't it?

MR. ESTRADA:

QUESTION:

6

MR. ESTRADA:

No --

And therefore we could entertain it.
You could entertain it.

But if

7

ruled on by the Court, and even if ruled on favorably to

8

the respondents, it would not, in the end, support the

9

judgment, because in our view the facts pled in the

10

complaint, though not the legal theory, do show other

11

predicate acts like arson and other crimes that are

12

predicate acts under RICO, which though not pled as a

13

legal theory, are pled as facts and which would be -- and

14

which, in our view, would be sufficient to support the

15

judgment on the pleadings.

16

Though we have not briefed the Hobbs Act issue,

17

I should say that it is far from clear that nothing was

obtained in this case, taking the claims in the complaint

19

in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.

Mr. Estrada, why I'm concerned about

For example, at

When this Court declined to grant cert on the

extortion."

And there is no extortion in this case for

two fundamental reasons.

This statute, the Hobbs Act, was

modeled on New York law.

New York law was modeled on the

common law.

In 1865, the field code commentary carefully

explained that the extortion provisions of that code was
part of the property loss series: embezzlement, larceny,
robbery and extortion.

Each requires a common law taking,

a trespatory taking.
What is happening in this case is they are
transposing a clear common law term, extortion, and making
it into a modern statutory term, coercion.

And they're

doing that by taking the concept "property," which starts
out to mean tangible property.
intangible property.
intangible rights.

extortion should be construed narrowly so that it does not

Your Honor, let me trace the

legislative history at this point.

An earlier statute

"business" was dropped is because two statutes were

very real ambiguity this Court had to deal with in

MR. BLAKEY:

You certainly do.

The question is

whether you have them in this statute in this context.

If I heard Mr. Blakey right, his argument began

up the RICO statute.

But I would also like to remind the Court and
Mr. Blakey that in his 1 80 article which is relied upon
by Mr. Scheidler in his brief, he said -- and more

10

important, this Court has said on many occasion that

11

Congress knew how to put a limitation in RICO when it

12

wanted to.

13

done for illicit gain, two words would have solved the

14

problem and we wouldn't see the quagmire of issues like

15

Mr. Blakey has been forced to address this morning.

And if Congress wanted to limit RICO to crimes

The question -- the argument that he makes

raises so many questions that no one can answer.

18

lower courts couldn't say -- with all the various

definitions they've come up with in Ivic, in Bagaric,

20

which took away motive and gave dimension, it still

21

doesn't answer the question of where we're supposed to

look for this economic motive or dimension or gain.

Mr. Blakey's reliance on the antitrust laws is

mystifying to me, because the antitrust laws for more than

13

three-quarters of a century have taught that good motives

do not save illegal acts.

case, because each and every one of them involved either

Your Honor, going back almost a

century, we know that when the antitrust laws were

10

enacted, the word "restraint of trade" was a highly

11

technical, highly legalistic term, and the Court had to

infer what it meant.

In any case, it was a limitation on

The Eighth Circuit decision in Council of

A purely political

in 1920 and that had been good law ever since, that the
