ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN B. MORRISON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. MORRISON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The first question before the Court today is

12

whether the method by which military trial and appeals

13

judges are appointed is consistent with the Appointments

14

Clause of the Constitution.

15

petitioners' --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

All of the judges in

Mr. Morrison, how does it happen to

come up so late, rather than back in 1970, for instance?
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, I think that the

19

answer is that this Court's decision in Freytag in 1991

20

caused a recognition that the Appointments Clause had

21

ramifications beyond what people had considered it before.

22

That is my understanding, Your Honor.

23

when the issue was first raised, but that is my

24

understanding.

25

I was not there

All of the judges in petitioners' cases were

1

commissioned officers.

2

President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

3

the commissions that they received were commissions as

4

military officers and not as judicial officers, and the

5

question presented is whether that appointment satisfies

6

the Appointments Clause for their judicial positions.

7

QUESTION:

All of them were appointed by the

Well, are you distinguishing between

8

commissions as military officers and commissions as

9

Article III judicial officers?
MR. MORRISON:

10

But

No, Your Honor.

I'm

11

distinguishing -- the question is whether, in order to

12

fill the judicial offices which they hold as trial --

13

military trial judges or military appeals judges, whether

14

they have to receive a separate appointment under the

15

Appointments Clause.

16
17
18

That is the question.

I recognize they do not have to be Article III
judges.

There's no question about that here.
QUESTION:

Well, so, then why do you use the

19

term judicial -- a commission as a judicial officer?

20

that a word of art?

21

MR. MORRISON:

No.

Is

I simply indicated, Your

22

Honor, to fill the fill judicial office which -- I thought

23

I said judicial office, not officer, Your Honor, but the

24

office which they hold.

25

the addendum to our brief there are separate certificates

And as Your Honor will note, in

1

appointing each of these persons to a judicial office, and

2

that is why I use that particular term, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION:

But I had thought, Mr. Morrison, that

4

when a JAG officer in the Army and the Navy, as opposed to

5

the Marine Corps, is confirmed and appointed, he is

6

appointed as a legal officer.

7

MR. MORRISON:

That is correct.

It does not

8

apply to the Marine Corps; it does apply to the Army and

9

the Navy and the Air Force.

10

That narrows the group of people from all of the

11

officers in the military down to about 1,650 officers who

12

are law officers.

13

military trial judges or military appellate judges:

14

trial judges, and about 31 appeals judges.

Of that, only 3 percent are either

If your theory were to prevail, would

those legal officers be assignable to nonlegal duties?
MR. MORRISON:

I believe they now are in any

event, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Well, but under your theory you have

20

to be appointed to a specific office.

21

officer a specific office so that a legal officer could

22

not, say, take a command position or an officer position

23

in the combat unit?

24

MR. MORRISON:

Why isn't a legal

The principal reason, Your Honor,

and this is the heart of our argument, is that under the

Uniform Code of Military Justice only certain people,

2

those who are appointed as judges, can perform the major

3

functions that judges perform in the military:

4

over general and, in most cases, special court-martials;

5

deciding on whether evidence will be admitted; ruling on

challenges for cause; instructing the jury; ruling on

7

matters of -- other matters that come before such as

preliminary motions.

presiding

9

And most important of all, only a military judge

10

can decide in a special or general court-martial the guilt

11

or innocence of the accused and can pass sentence.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, I suppose only a military legal

officer can advise with reference to a will or a divorce?

14

MR. MORRISON:

15

QUESTION:

I don't know that, Your Honor.

So under your theory, it seems to me,

16

that a legal officer must be confined just to legal

17

duties.

18

Under your theory.
MR. MORRISON:

Your Honor, I don't believe

19

there's any statute governing the military that restricts

20

what legal officers can do.

designation do perform other legal duties, and no one,

except the judges, performs judging duties.

QUESTION:

3

Mr. Morrison, with respect to trial

said a second ago, in passing, that a military judge was

indispensable to a finding of guilt or innocence.

correct?

You said a second ago -- I think you

MR. MORRISON:

9

No.

Is that

I said, Your Honor, that

10

only a military trial judge sitting alone could find guilt

11

or innocence.

12

QUESTION:

I see.

13

MR. MORRISON:

In special and general

14

court-martials.

The Government points to the fact that in

15

summary court-martials a nonjudge could sit, but this

16

Court has held in Middendorf against Henry that those

17

summary court-martials are not criminal proceedings.

18

any event, are very different in terms of the punishment

19

that -QUESTION:

20

In

Now, is it correct that with respect

21

to the two higher grades of court-martial, a judge may not

22

sit alone without the consent of the accused?

23

right?

MR. MORRISON:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

So that unless the -7

That's not required.

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

But unless, though -- unless the

7

accused consents of the finding of guilt or innocence.

8

And I assume the determination of punishment would be made

9

by a panel, only one of whom presumably would be a

military judge.

The military judge does not sit

The judge is as a judge in the civilian

In the -- in the old days when we had law --

17

when there were law officers in the military, the law

18

officer would, in some cases, sit as an advisor.

19

the president of the court-martial is not the chief -- is

20

not the judge, and the judge does not vote on guilt or

21

innocence unless the case is referred to the judge.

22

approximately -- I don't have the exact figures, but a

23

very high percentage of cases are tried before military

24

judges alone.

not, under your theory, have to be appointed specially

MR. MORRISON:

Government's phraseology, to other military duties,

11

principally because there is no special qualifications.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, am I correct that your

3

germaneness argument is not based on the notion that there

4

is some inherent requirement that you cannot give a single

5

person duties that are so -- that are too diverse, but is

6

rather based upon the notion that Congress has not chosen

7

to give this person these sorts of duties?

8

In other words, it would be all right in your

9

mind if Congress -- if Congress said all military officers

20

shall do the following duties, and then listed everything

21

including the judicial officers.

22

23

MR. MORRISON:

I would say that's -- that is

substantially correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

25

MR. MORRISON:

All right.

With two caveats -- may I?

Two.

1

The first is that it isn't simply that Congress hasn't

2

said they may do it.

3

It has said only those persons who are designated judges

4

may perform the following functions.

The Congress has said the opposite.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. MORRISON:

7

So it's a little stronger than

Your Honor hypothesized.
QUESTION:

8

9

That's correct.

But Congress has also, has it not,

made clear since 1968 that any person who is commissioned

10

as an officer in the military forces runs a risk of

11

becoming a judicial officer, may be designated a judicial

12

officer.

13

anyone who received an officer's commission knew that one

14

of the duties of being an officer could be to be a

15

judicial officer.

So, certainly, once the '68 statute was passed,

Isn't that so?

16

MR. MORRISON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. MORRISON:

No, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor.

Why -Under Article 26, only persons

19

who are members of the bar can become a judicial officer,

20

and they must also be certified by the Judge Advocate

21

General of their service in order to become a judicial

22

officer.

23

QUESTION:

But that's fine.

But Congress

24

certainly envisioned that any military -- or you could

25

also say there are certain requirements for other

particular.

To be a medical officer, for example, of

2

course you have to be a doctor.

3

MR. MORRISON:

4

QUESTION:

Yes.

But the fact is that Congress

anticipated that the military commission would be enough

6

to authorize that person to be a judicial officer, once

7

the '68 act was in effect.

Now, with respect to judicial

But surely there -- are there any judicial

10

officers functioning today who were commissioned prior to

11

1968?

I would doubt that.
MR. MORRISON:

12

I do not know.

I do not believe

13

so, Your Honor.

14

commissioned prior to 1968 who are still serving as

15

judicial officers, some of the most senior grades.

16

But there are probably officers who were

But, Your Honor, I think I'm not understanding your

17

question, because it seemed to me to be rather the

18

opposite.

19

might have served as a law officer because there were no

20

special qualifications embodied in the Uniform Code of

21

Military Justice, as there are now.

22

narrow group of people is now even eligible in Congress'

23

view, that is those who are admitted to a bar.

24

they must, in addition, be certified by the Judge Advocate

25

General before they can be law officers -- because they

And then

can be judicial officers.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, I would say -- it's almost

17

this didn't happen right after 1968.

18

MR. MORRISON:

4

QUESTION:

So the only way that Congress could

5

make it better is to have this double appointment, is that

6

it?

7

MR. MORRISON:

Yes.

And I would say, Your

8

Honor, it's not a large matter because there are only 31

9

appeals judges and 91 trial judges who serve for periods

10

of time, and the burden would be very minimal in order to

11

comply with the Appointments Clause.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Morrison, I thought you gave me

13

the opposite answer.

I thought you told me that there is

14

no inherent disability for Congress defining an office so

15

broadly that it could include becoming a judicial officer.

16

So certainly --

17

MR. MORRISON:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, I think --

--At least one other solution is for

19

Congress to say, whenever a military officer is

20

commissioned, that officer will be competent to become a

judge under -- under this 96 -- 1968 law.

that that's good enough.

QUESTION:

Okay.

Congress has done that.

And my point is it seems to me

It seems to me that once the 1968

10

act was passed, in effect that's what Congress has said.

11

It's right there on the statute books.

12

anybody who's appointed as an officer can become a

13

judicial officer so long as he has the legal

14

qualifications.

15

relying upon the technical fact that Congress did not

16

write it all into one statute.

17

It's clear that

It seems to me you're -- you're really

MR. MORRISON:

I don't think that that is the

18

scheme that Congress has envisioned, and I perhaps

19

answered your question too hastily.

20

that Congress has made it quite clear that it views the

21

persons serving as judges as different from other military

22

officers, both because they must all be members of the bar

23

and because they all must be certified as qualified by the

24

Judge Advocate General.

QUESTION:

Is

your point that Congress cannot regard two functions as

with that theory, Your Honor, and there is nothing to

about whether -- as Justice Scalia has suggested, that

what Congress did in 1968 was to say that everyone who is

a military officer can be a judge, and we equate the two.

That cannot explain how civilians can become judges.

There has to be a separate method of appointment and a

separate theory.

QUESTION:

10

our obligation to construe this law in the way that would

save its constitutionality so that if there is a discrete

problem, that that would be put aside and not have that

MR. MORRISON:

I don't disagree with that, Your

Honor.

17

Congress was doing and whether what Congress was doing was

18

what I believe they were doing, which was to establish a

19

separate judicial office in the military for which only a

20

very few people would become eligible and would be chosen

21

to serve by a process that would take place in the

22

military, that Congress was recognizing that there was a

difference and they wanted them treated differently, and

what Congress failed to do was to provide for their

You are not urging, as far as I can

there is a role for the convening authority that is a

And it's also true in a special court-martial

10

situation that there can be proceedings without a military

judge present, such that military officers -- and in some

cases there can be one-third representation of enlisted

that that's closer to being a juror that being a judge,

bring up Justice Jackson's wonderful quotation regarding

19

the word "quasi" and you do have to use that throughout

20

your brief, that these are quasi-judicial functions.

21

I think you have to concede that prior to 1968

22

there was no purely judicial function that a military

23

officer performed.

Is that not accurate?

Prior to 1968, those decisions were made by

Prior to '68, it wasn't clear that

That's correct.

I was -- I was exploring with Mr.

Morrison the possibility of deciding this case on

problem.

GENERAL DAYS:

6

7

Indeed, that is -- that is

correct, Justice Ginsburg.

8

I wanted to turn to the --

9

QUESTION:

Well, can you say with any confidence

10

that a conviction rendered by a defective court-martial,

11

if it were determined that the court-martial were

12

defective under the Appointments Clause, would not be

subject to attack on habeas corpus, even though it had

been -- you know, concluded on direct appeal many years

ago?

GENERAL DAYS:

Your Honor, I think that we would

17

have to look to the de facto officer doctrine and operate

18

on the assumption that those decisions were rendered --

19

those judgments were rendered in the context of a

20

legitimate process, and therefore public policy would

21

justify making those de jure offices occupied by,

balancing process with respect to practices that have

2

been, as I've said earlier, in effect for centuries.

3

We disagree with their proposition, namely that

balancing is appropriate.

We think that given this

5

Court's many decisions recognizing the deference that is

6

properly afforded to decisions made by Congress and the

7

President as Commander in Chief, with respect to the

8

governance of the military, it suggests that this is not a

9

situation where the military has the responsibility to

10

come forward and justify practices that are time honored.

11

But rather it's the responsibility of petitioners to show

12

why their concerns, why their claims are so

13

extraordinarily weighty as to overcome the balance already

14

struck by Congress.

19

I've certainly observed the views of members of this Court

20

with respect to the Medina-Mathews dichotomy.

21

it is instructive that after Mathews was decided, this

no mention of a Mathews line of analysis in Middendorf.

judge is subject to disciplinary action by superiors, if

11

the judge isn't tough enough or something like that.

12

that's been a concern that's been expressed from time to

time around the country and I'm sure in the halls of

14

Congress, and these are serious concerns in the military

done to make the system of military justice more fair and

That's correct.

In fact, Chief

Justice Rehnquist, if one looks at the system, although
