CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Rosenbaum.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEVEN J. ROSENBAUM

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves a pricing order issued by the

11

Massachusetts Commissioner of Agriculture.

12

this order violates the Commerce Clause of the United

13

States Constitution because it restrains competition

14

between in-state and out-of-state dairy farmers, blatantly

15

discriminates against out-of-state dairy farmers, and

16

prevents milk processors from taking advantage of cheaper

17

out-of-state milk.

18

QUESTION:

We submit that

Mr. Rosenbaum, I'm wondering if -- if

19

all we have in the order was the requirement that there be

20

paid an assessment on all liquid milk sold in

21

Massachusetts, would that be a Commerce Clause violation?

22

MR. ROSENBAUM:

If the assessment were to go

23

into the general revenues of the State, Your Honor, is

24

that the assumption I'm to be making?

25

QUESTION:

If that --

Nothing more than that.

We have the

1

2

assessment on all liquid milk.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

If the assessment goes to the

3

State and not to the farmers, that would not be a

4

violation of the Commerce Clause, because that would

5

simply be a tax.

6

QUESTION:

Not -- if all we had was not an

7

assessment, but just money appropriated by the State to

8

give to Massachusetts dairy farmers to help them, would

9

that be a Commerce Clause violation?

10

MR. ROSENBAUM:

This Court said in the New

11

Energy case that ordinarily a subsidy will not be a

12

violation of the Commerce Clause.

13

actually addressed a case that had such facts, and

14

actually opined with specificity that such a regime is

15

constitutional.

16
17

QUESTION:

Presumably that's okay.

MR. ROSENBAUM:

19

QUESTION:

21

We have all

kinds of ways of helping local industries, don't we?

18

20

The Court has never yet

Yes, pre --

And we've never held that's a

violation of the Commerce Clause.
MR. ROSENBAUM:

Presumably money appropriated

22

from the general revenues of the State of Massachusetts

23

going to Massachusetts dairy farmers would be

24

constitutional.

25

QUESTION:

Well, if both of those acts can be

1

constitutional, then what makes it unconstitutional when

2

you put them together, in your view?

3

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Well, this Court held in New

4

Energy explicitly that merely because a State could

5

achieve its goals through a subsidy did not mean other

6

methods of achieving that goal would be constitutional.

7

And that is the situation here.

8

the buyers, are being required to pay additional sums to

9

the in-state farmers.

Here, we, the processors,

There is no subsidization going on.

10

This is a pricing order, as the title of the -- of the

11

document makes clear.

12

Subsidies, of course, are different.

Those come

3

from the general revenues, as a whole.

4

to the political processes of the requirement that dairy

5

farmers fight it out with firemen or policemen or anyone

6

else who wants those funds.

7

substantial problem for that reason.

8
9

They are subject

And they're unlikely to be a

This, though, is a very different system.

This

is a system that was put in place by the Commissioner

20

explicitly because he believed that Massachusetts dairy

21

farmers were, quote, being overrun, end quote, by

22

out-of-state dairy farmers, because those dairy farmers

23

had, as he said, huge herds, vast acreage, and ready

24

availability of supply and labor.

25

QUESTION:

Well, that purpose would not be

invalidating so long -- you -- I think you've said -- so

2

long as the subsidy were applied in some other way, right?

3

MR. ROSENBAUM:

4

QUESTION:

The -- the only way --

I can -- I can want to protect or --

5

or compensate Massachusetts dairy farmers for their

6

inefficiency if I want to, right?

7

MR. ROSENBAUM:

I believe the only method by

8

which that should be permitted is if it's a direct subsidy

9

from the general revenues of the State.
QUESTION:

10

All right.

So, all that has to be

11

done in this case is to provide -- provide the same tax,

12

but the funds, instead of going into this segregated fund,

13

go into general revenues, and that'll do it?

14
15

MR. ROSENBAUM:

No, Your Honor, that's not my

point.

16

QUESTION:

That's not?

17

MR. ROSENBAUM:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. ROSENBAUM:

I'm assuming, in this --

Why wouldn't that do it?
Well, because I'm assuming --

20

because, in that hypothetical, if the money were still

21

being raised through the assessment on milk processors,

22

running it through the general revenues would not make a

23

difference.

24

to Justice O'Connor's question, that there is no specific

25

or special assessment or tax being placed on my clients

MR. ROSENBAUM:

You -- you could not single out

which the State of Massachusetts feels its dairy farmers

3

are not capable of achieving sufficient price based on

4

market prices.

5

they have required my clients to pay more money on the

6

milk they receive from Massachusetts farmers.

7

What is before this Court is a situation in

They want to increase that price.

And

If they only went that far, they would be acting

8

constitutionally under the Nebbia rule.

But the concern

9

of Massachusetts is that my clients and other processors

10

would then turn to the milk of out-of-state farmers, which

11

would be cheaper if it were not subject to that same

12

premium price.

What they have done here is said, we will

3

require the same premium, the same extra price, to be paid

4

on out-of-state milk, as well, to prevent out-of-state

5

farmers from taking advantage of the fact that their

6

prices are lower than the prices required by the pricing

7

order to be paid to Massachusetts farmers.

8
9

The State has gone one step further than that,
and said that although this premium price must be paid on

20

out-of-state milk, the recipients of that out-of-state

21

milk will not be -- of that price -- will not be the

22

out-of-state farmer.

MR. ROSENBAUM:

2

QUESTION:

3

That's correct, Your Honor.

It just so happens that a high

percentage of the milk is purchased from out of State.

4

MR. ROSENBAUM:

The assessment is on milk of any

5

source.

But any source, obviously, encompasses both

6

in-state and out-of-state milk.

7

comparable to the situation in the Baldwin case, where the

8

minimum price that was established applied to all milk.

9

It -QUESTION:

10

In that sense, this is

Well, do you take the position that

11

if all we had before us was an assessment on the sale in

12

Massachusetts of all liquid milk from any source, that

13

that would be a violation of Baldwin -- that it would fall

14

under the Baldwin principle and be invalid?

15

MR. ROSENBAUM:

If the assessment -- no, Your

16

Honor.

17

the assessment were just to go to support road building or

18

the general needs of the State, there would not be a

19

displacement of interstate competition because the

20

in-state farmer and out-of-state farmer, despite the

21

assessment, are still receiving the pre-assessment amounts

22

of money.

23

You have to look at who gets the money.

If -- if

So, if the out-of-state farmer has a cost

advantage over the in-state farmer, which was the finding

25

that the Massachusetts Commissioner reached, he will still

have that price advantage afterwards.
QUESTION:

2

But you say that if they both, impose

3

that tax and also subsidize Massachusetts producers, then

4

it becomes bad?

5

MR. ROSENBAUM:

6

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

What if they only subsidized

7

Massachusetts producers in two-thirds of the amount that

8

they -- that they garner from this tax?
MR. ROSENBAUM:

That would, of course, be a

10

different case.

It seems to -- and I think, as I said

11

before, this Court has not yet had before it a case

12

involving a challenge to a subsidy coming from general

13

revenues.

14

for it to be unconstitutional is not now before the Court.

And how close one has to get to that situation

Well, I --

between general revenues and this scheme.

This scheme is

7

imposed by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Agriculture.

8

Through a one-time action, he can require this price to be

paid forever.

Monies coming from general revenues are

rather, whether the computation of the amount of the

2

subsidy is dependent upon the amount collected from all

the dealers?

4

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Yes.

That's the key, isn't it, rather than

-- it doesn't matter whether you fund through general

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Your Honor, I don't believe it

would be critical.
QUESTION:

I thought in your answer to Justice

4

Stevens you said it was.

5

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Your Honor, what I was

6

suggesting was that if there were so little correlation

7

between the two that they could be viewed as wholly

8

separate, then perhaps at that point this Court would find

9

it to be acceptable.

But, as a general rule, certainly

10

here, where you do have direct correlation between the

11

two, this is an unconstitutional scheme.

12

QUESTION:

But isn't -- isn't it because the

13

correlation is directly to a source of revenue which is

14

not subject to political responsiveness within the State?

15

Isn't that the key to your argument?

16

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Your Honor, I believe that is

certainly a key to our argument.

milk commissioner in Massachusetts or the -- what do you

But there are practical limitations that will

result from it coming from general revenues.

QUESTION:

our Commerce Clause analysis?

5

I think --

We ought to somehow fuse those into

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Well, Your Honor, this Court has

6

recognized that a State -- recognized explicitly in the

7

New Energy case -- that a State could achieve, at times,

8

the same goals of protecting its in-state citizens through

9

a subsidy that it might also be able to achieve through an

10

unconstitutional restraint on interstate commerce.

11

this Court held that that fact did not lead to what would

12

otherwise be an unconstitutional constraint being deemed

13

constitutional.

14

MR. ROSENBAUM:

But

Well, I -- I agree with your

15

reading of that case.

16

opinion suggests that it would make a great deal of

17

difference whether the levy or the dispensation was made

18

directly by the legislature or by the milk commissioner

19

being authorized by the legislature.

20

But I don't think the New Energy

MR. ROSENBAUM:

The difference is that under

21

this scheme, what is happening is Massachusetts dairy

22

farmers who are inefficient and not able to compete are

being given a preferential status, as compared to

out-of-state dairy farmers who have lower costs and

competitive advantages.

That is the basis -- that -- although we are not asserting

That is an openly blatant discrimination.

It was not clear to me why you have

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Your Honor, we would -- what --

10

what we are losing here is two things.

11

Baldwin, if the higher price only applied to in-state

12

milk, which is constitutional under Nebbia, we would

13

prefer the out-of-state milk, because that out-of-state

14

milk would not be subject to the lower prices -- to the

15

higher prices and, therefore, it would be cheaper.

16

First, as in

That is to say, if the pricing order only

applied to Massachusetts-produced milk, then the higher

18

price would only be applicable to that milk, and we would

19

buy more out-of-state milk.

20

to the Commissioner, under the current situation, in-state

21

farmers are losing sales to out-of-state farmers because

22

out-of-state farmers have cheaper costs and, therefore,

23

can make a go of it at the current market prices, while

24

in-state farmers cannot.

how much Massachusetts farmers needed to cover their cost

10

So, that competition has been wholly displaced.

11

That is to say, as this Court held in Baldwin, one of the

12

key incidents of competition, interstate, is that citizens

of one State, who have lower cost, are entitled to

displace sales by citizens of another State who have

The use of a trust fund presents no issue under

that even if money is paid into the general fund, the

Apparently, West Lynn would argue

I didn't understand it to be that.

I

thought they were arguing that if the State itself linked

geared to the amount of the tax; that then it could be

challenged?

MR. WILKINS:

Perhaps that's their argument.

thought their reply brief was -- was broader than that.

But even if the question is the matter of linkage, we

15

think that the matter of linkage is, again, a matter that

QUESTION:
