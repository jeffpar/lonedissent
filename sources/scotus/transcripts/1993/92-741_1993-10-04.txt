CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Mr. Bender.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BENDER:

8

10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
This case arises out of the financial failure of

11

a large California savings and loan institution in the

12

early 1980's.

13

financial losses.

14

$100 million to about $15 million in the several months

15

preceding the seizure of the bank.

16

The bank had been suffering very serious
It's net worth had gone down from about

In the week preceding the seizure, depositors

17

removed about $70 million from the bank's deposits.

18

bank was seized by the California Savings and Loan

19

Commissioner because she thought the bank was operating in

20

an unsafe manner.

21

which has since been replaced by FDIC --as the receiver,

22

and FSLIC was also appointed receiver under Federal law.

23

The

She appointed the F-S-L-I-C -- FSLIC,

Under FSLIC's policy then, which is still FDIC's

24

policy, when a thrift institution fails for financial

25

reasons, they immediately terminate all the top management

1

of the bank, for obvious reasons.

2

That's the management that got the bank into the

3

financial condition that required the seizure, those are

4

the highest paid people, but perhaps most importantly, the

5

receiver's job is either to terminate the bank, or to

6

merge it with another going institution, and for the

7

purposes of doing that, it's very important not to have

8

the top management there, because the institution into

9

which it's merged will have its own management.

10

Pursuant to that policy, the four top officers

11

of Fidelity were terminated -- the president, the

12

plaintiff in this case, Mr. Meyer, who is the president's

13

brother, and two other people.

14

happens is, the bank is terminated -- the receiver takes

15

over at the end of one day, and at the beginning of the

10

next day the bank reopens as a new institution which is

17

chartered by the Federal Home Bank Board.

18

later, that new institution merged the bank into Citibank,

19

I think, in California, and it continues to exist in that

20

form.

He brought a lawsuit based on many different

claimed rights.

were claims not of a breach of contract but claims under

the due process clause.

said that California law gave him as a long-term employee

8

of the bank, but he didn't -- the suit that got to trial

9

before the jury was not a suit based on the breach of

The only ones which proceeded to trial

The lawsuit was based on an

10

contract, it was a suit based on the alleged deprivation

11

of his contract rights without due process.
QUESTION:

12

He says --

May I interrupt you, sir?

If he had

13

been fired by the bank, if there hadn't been the takeover,

14

would he have had a contract claim under State law against

15

the bank?
MR. BENDER:

16

If the bank had continued to

17

operate and he had been fired, yes, so far as we can tell,

18

he would have - -

19

QUESTION:

He did have a right under his

20

contract to pre -- in effect, to pre-deprivation process,

21

then?

22

MR. BENDER:

No, I don't think.it was a right to

23

process, it was a contract right.

1

that he didn't get pre-deprivation process.

2

had a contract claim to the same effect against the bank?

3

MR. BENDER:

No.

Would he have

I think the contract claim

4

would have just been for breach of his contract of

5

employment.

6

California contract law, that would suggest he had any

7

procedural rights.

8

law would have been a suit for breach of contract against

9

the bank for terminating him without just cause.

10
11

He makes no suggestion, and I know nothing in

His remedy under California contract

That's

not the suit that he brought here.
The suit that he has recovered on, a jury -- the

12

two suits that went to the jury were a claim against FDIC

13

for the deprivation of his property without due process,

14

and a claim against the receiver for deprivation of his

15

property, his contract right, without due process.

16

The jury found for the receiver on the ground

17

that he had qualified immunity, but the jury found for the

18

plaintiff against FDIC in the amount of $130,000.

It

goes to the question of whether it's cognizable, and so

forth.

I don't think -- I don't think it

6

If he had a tort remedy, couldn't it

7

arguably be said then the Federal Tort Claims Act would

8

prevail?

9

MR. BENDER:

Well, if he had a tort remedy under

10

State law, he could try to assert that State law remedy

11

against the Federal Government under the Federal Tort

12

Claims Act, but that's not the right he alleges in this

case.

QUESTION:

If you're right, Mr. Bender, about

16

your argument that there is no due process right of the

17

nature claimed, wouldn't that go to the receiver,

18

Pattullo, as well as to the -- FSLIC?

19

MR. BENDER:

20

QUESTION:

Yes.

Yes, it would.

So your position, if you would

21

prevail on that second argument that you make that there

22

is no due process right to tenure as against this Federal

23

agency, then Pattullo should never have gone to trial.

24

MR. BENDER:

25

QUESTION:

That's right.
You would never get to the question

2

of qualified immunity.
MR. BENDER:

That's right.

This case should

3

have been dismissed before trial, because there was no

4

deprivation of property, nor -- even if there was a

5

deprivation of property, it wasn't without due process,

6

and -- well, let me turn to that first, because I think

7

that's really the most fundamental question in this case.

8

9

There was no deprivation of property because the
only property right he asserts, the right to continued

10

employment, ended by virtue of the failure of the bank and

11

its seizure by the receiver.

12

seized by the receiver, it's just as if the bank had

13

itself gone out of business, because --

14

QUESTION:

When the bank fails and it's

Mr. Bender, the first question you

15

present in your petition for certiorari is whether FSLIC

can be held liable for tort damages arising on a Bivens

cause of action.

argue the second question you present first?

19

Now, you're choosing, I take it, to

MR. BENDER:

Yes.

I think it's a little easier

20

to understand the case if you understand first what the

21

tort right is, what the constitutional tort right is that

22

he's asserting.

But I take it you're also going to

argue, eventually, your -MR. BENDER:

Absolutely.

If he worked for the bank with a contract of - -

3
4

an implied contract of continued employment and the bank

5

went out of business for financial reasons, I don't think

6

anyone would think that he had a right of continued

7

employment with a bank which had failed and was no longer

8

in business, and that's exactly what happens when a bank
goes into receivership.

You can tell that by the

10

notion -- the common law notion of receivership, which has

11

been absorbed into the Federal statutes, cases going way

back, including decisions of this Court, that -QUESTION:

13

Does this California law agree with

In other words, if there is a receivership of a

MR. BENDER:

We think so, but that's irrelevant,

18

because Federal law clearly supersedes California law, and

1

the receiver here was appointed under Federal law.

20

Remember, this is a bank insured by the Federal

21

Government.

MR. BENDER:

Could they fire all the

In fact, FDIC now has a policy of

5

firing all employees immediately upon the onset of a

6

receivership and hiring back those that it wants to hire

7

back to do whatever the bank wants to do.

8

9

I think it's a mistake to assume that the bank
always continues operating in exactly the same form.

The

10

receiver has the right to terminate, wind up the affairs

11

of the bank, he has the right to consolidate or merge it

12

with another bank, he has a right to draw it in, draw in

13

its scope of operations to make it profitable, new

14

management takes over, the receiver feels it needs new

15

management in order to accomplish those things, and to

16

have the old top management staying on in the bank as

17

you're trying to merge it with another bank, which they

18

may have resisted doing for a number of years, as you're

19

trying to wind up its affairs, would be really disruptive.

20

QUESTION:

Perhaps so, but why is it so that you

21

would be without liability for breaking those contracts

22

any more than you would be without liability for breaking

other contracts?

is pay for past services, and similarly, a company that

11

had supplied desks, let's say, to the bank, which already

12

had them, and they hadn't paid the bill yet, that company

13

would be entitled to recover that out of the assets of the

14

bank.

15

QUESTION:

Suppose it was a contract to provide

MR. BENDER:

MR. BENDER:

It's quite clear ---by terminating that contract?
It's quite clear that the receiver

has the power to terminate those kinds of executory

contracts which haven't yet taken place.

regulations said that the receiver had the power to reject

or repudiate any lease or contract which it considers

burdensome.

QUESTION:

MR. BENDER:

Without liability?
Without liability for future

3

profits, without liability for services that had not been

rendered.

5

where the money had already be earned, and then there

6

would be liability.

7

it would be contract liability that would come out of the

8

remaining assets of that bank, not liability that would be

9

paid by the assets of the Federal Government.

It can repudiate contracts for past services

QUESTION:

10

It would be contract liability, and

Well, it doesn't make much sense to

11

talk about repudiating past --or liability for past

12

contractual breaches, does it?

13

held liable on a contract measure of damages whether you

14

technically repudiate the thing or just admit you didn't

15

perform.

16

MR. BENDER:

I mean, you're going to be

That's right, and so the main

17

burden of the repudiation clause, it seems to me, has to

18

be towards these future contracts.

let him recover on that contract, how much could he

20

recover?

21

QUESTION:

If you were going to

Well but, I mean, you can say

22

repudiate -- any businessman can repudiate a contract, but

23

the issue is whether you're liable for the money under it.

24

To say you can repudiate it doesn't establish that you're

25

not liable for the breach.

enforceable only by a suit for breach of contract, and

7

that suit would be payable only out of the remaining net

assets of the bank, so that if the bank in fact had no net

9

assets, he wouldn't get any money.

10

That's not the

What he has tried to do here is to turn that

11

contract suit out of no --

12

of no assets, into a suit where he wants to

13

the taxpayer's money through the Federal appropriations to

14

the FDIC, or FSLIC, by saying that I'm not suing under

15

contract, I'm suing for the breach of the contract without

due process, as if he had a constitutional right to a

hearing before that.

QUESTION:

So it's not an essential part of your

19

case, and you don't really argue here that when there is a

repudiation there is necessarily no liability for the

Not at all, although

we do feel

that there is no liability for the future work

going to do, that the contract terminates.

MR. BENDER:

I don't have to agree with that.
No, you don't have to agree with

that.
QUESTION:

5

And I suppose it's perhaps restating

6

the same point that I take it you're not claiming that the

7

Government is scot-free here of liability on the claim

8

asserted simply because it was acting as a regulator and

9

not as a mere successor to the originally contracting

No, we're not arguing that at

all.

deprive him of his property without due process, first

14

because we don't think he had any property, but if, as

15

Justice Scalia believes, you think he was deprived of

16

property, that was still not without due process, because

17

he has a completely adequate remedy, the normal remedy,

18

the remedy he would have had if the bank had terminated

19

him itself, namely, to sue the bank under California law

20

of contract, which he is able to do.

We're arguing that the Government here did not

QUESTION:

But isn't there an inconsistency in

your position, though, Mr. Bender, because you say that

regulations and that sort of thing, and yet his remedy is

purely State law?
MR. BENDER:

Well, because the receivership

3

doesn't -- although the receivership has the power,

4

Federal law has the power to totally supersede State law,

5

it hasn't done that, and it's clear that the receivership

6

permits suits to be brought against the remaining assets

7

of the bank for contracts on which the money had already

8

been earned, such as contracts for past services.

9

Federal law tried to wipe out those contracts as well, I

If

10

think there would be a problem with the takings clause.

11

In any event, the receiver has never -- has never -- as

12

far as I know has never alleged that that happened.

13

QUESTION:

In addition is the process that is

14

due, is the claim that can be asserted against the assets

15

of the failed association --

16

MR. BENDER:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Exactly.
And that is the full extent of the

process that is constitutionally due.
MR. BENDER:

Exactly, right.

That's all the

20

process he would have had due if the bank had gone out of

21

business itself, or if the bank had fired him, and there's

22

absolutely no reason why he should suddenly get an entry

23

into the Federal Treasury because the bank goes into

receivership.

that would run a bank and run it into the ground so that

2

the depositors lose all their money except for the Federal

3

insurance should then be able to have a key into the

4

Federal Treasury to recover on contracts that they

5

couldn't recover on against the banks.

6

QUESTION:

But Mr. Bender, isn't it at least

7

theoretically possible that even -- if he had a State law

8

right to recover assets from the bank which in turn would

9

give him a right to pretermination hearing, maybe he would

10

lose against the -- on his State contract claim but

11

nevertheless be able to argue that if you'd given me the

12

hearing to which I was entitled, I could have persuaded

13

you not to fire me, because I really wasn't involved in

14

all this stuff?

15

MR. BENDER:

He can argue that, and he does, but

16

that is not a -- that is not a convincing argument,

17

because the Federal law made clear at the time, then in

18

the regulations, now in the statute, that the receiver can

The question here is whether, if there were a

that there would be such a suit is the sue-and-be-sued

MR. BENDER:

I don't think so.

If the tort

don't think the sue-and-be-sued clauses were meant to

QUESTION:

Mr. Bender, is it part of your

argument that the Bivens claim simply doesn't extend to

agencies as distinguished from individuals, so that in no

7

should one think of a Bivens claim as against an entity as

distinguished from an individual?

9

MR. BENDER:

That's right, and that's because

10

there are only two kinds of agencies.

12

sued.

13

you cannot sue the United States on a Bivens-type tort.

I don't think it's being made for the first

MR. BENDER:

11

I think it's important to

understand that.

13

Many of them were first, and by the time of the tort

14

claims act in 1946, there had been a number of tort suits

15

brought against the sue-and-be-sued agencies, State law

16

tort suits, because there were no Bivens claims at that

time.

18

The sue-and-be-sued clauses were first.

In enacting the Federal Tort Claims Act,

Congress said that Government, the Federal Government is

now going to be liable on the torts of all Federal

21

agencies, sue-and-be-sued or not, with certain important

22

limitations and at the same time it said -- in the statute

legislative history -- let me read you a brief excerpt of

2

the committee report that accompanied that statute.
It says,

3

"Section 404" -- that's the predecessor

of the statute we now have -- "provides that Federal

agencies suable in their own name prior to the enactment

of this bill will no longer be suable for torts cognizable

8

of the United States on precisely the same footing as

10

This will place torts of suable agencies

I don't see any way you can read that language

11

except to say that you could no longer sue the sue-and-

12

be-sued agencies for tort --

13

QUESTION:

14

That language in the legislative

history is not in the statute itself.

15

MR.. BENDER:

Well, I think the language in the

statute itself is just as clear, because it refers to --

17

it says the authority of any Federal agency to sue and be

18

sued in its own name shall not be construed to authorize

19

suits against such Federal agency on claims which are

20

cognizable under the tort claims act, and it's clear from

Before the tort claims act, you could

Mr. Bender, what you're -- you're

what cognizable means, but I think when you start to think

about the consequences of holding that it means that it's

MR. FILICE:

The Federal Government, unlike the

It has

Not necessarily so, Justice Scalia.

In this particular case, Mr. Meyer had a property

10

interest, and I will describe where his property interest

11

came from, and the regulation in question said not that

12

immediately upon the seizure that Mr. Meyer's contract

13

interest ceased to exist, but rather his contract ceased

#4

15

to exist when and if it was found to be burdensome.
Counsel has suggested that the regulation now is

16

that all employees are terminated at the time of seizure.

17

Under that regulation, perhaps Mr. Meyer wouldn't have a

18

claim, but under the regulation in effect at the time of

19

this seizure, there had to be a determination that his

20

contract was burdensome.

1

No.

We are saying that under Board

2

of Regents v. Roth, we look not to the Constitution to

3

define Mr. Meyer's property interest, instead, we look to

4

independent sources such as State law.
State law in this circumstance, under California

5
6

law, Mr. Meyer had an implied employment contract that he

7

would not be terminated absent just cause for dismissal,

8

and that implied employment contract was consistent with,

9

in effect was ratified and permitted by Federal

10

regulations at the time, which were also different at that

11

time.

12

At that time, the Federal regulation provided

13

that employees of savings and loans could have contracts

14

and they would not be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound

15

practice so long as they had an adequate, appropriate

16

termination for cause provision, so the Federal regulation

17

contemplated that there could be employment contracts with

18

employees of savings and loans that had exactly what the

19

California implied contract had --

20

QUESTION:

Well, if the Federal law is more

21

favorable to the employee and says you must show that it's

22

unsafe or unsound, we must find it burdensome -- the

23

Federal law's more favorable, then there is a

constitutional right, but if the Federal law is harsher

right, that's a strange -MR. FILICE:

2

I don't believe that is strange,

3

Your Honor, because if you look at Roth, which is the

4

touchstone of the property interest we're talking about,

5

it talks about reasonable expectations of the employee,

6

and if you go to a savings and loan today and get a job,

7

you know, under regulations as I understand them, that

8

your job is forever subject to being terminated

9

immediately upon a seizure, but at that time, Federal

10

regulations provided that you could have an employment

11

contract with your employer, and it was not prohibited so

12

long as there was.an adequate termination for cause

13

provision.

14

QUESTION:

So when you're hired by the State

15

entity, or by the savings and loan, you're -- to determine

16

the nature of your property interest, you're looking to

17

the day when that institution is going to go under and be

18

taken over by a Federal receiver, and that's --

19

MR. FILICE:

I believe that really is a legal

20

fiction, but what you look to under Roth v. Board of

21

Regents to define the property interest that Mr. Meyer is

22

asserting is independent sources such as State law which

23

define -- which first of all create the property right,

24

and at the same time define its scope, and California law

25

defined the scope of this property interest as a right to

that definition was completely consistent with Federal law

So our argument is that Mr. Meyer had a property

defining the degree of process that you are entitled to,

MR. FILICE:

No.

9

QUESTION:
MR. FILICE:

10

Well said.
Because the definition of

11

Mr. Meyer's property right was that he was entitled to

12

continued employment absent just cause for dismissal, and

13

so when -- when the savings and loan was taken over, at

14

that point in time he had an interest in continued

employment the same as if he had had a written contract

Where do you get the constitutional right just

by virtue of having the State property right and without

MR. FILICE:

The constitutional right, Justice

Scalia, comes from the Fifth Amendment, and when we are

available to the FSLIC as well?

MR. FILICE:

Well, first of all, the qualified

immunity defense was not submitted, not pled, not raised

5

as a defense by FSLIC.

6

that insofar as sue-and-be-sued agencies are concerned,

the qualified immunity doctrine should not be applied

because the rationale of the qualified immunity doctrine

is to protect Federal employees from personal liability so

Secondly, however, I would say

that they will zealously complete their tasks.
Where you're talking about an agency, and where

you are saying an agency should have appropriate

You're saying the process that is due somehow

12

It seems to me the only reason to make that - -

13

to choose the former rather than the latter is that it's

That's correct, and apparently, the

way the Government now operates, probably nobody could

make this claim, because the way the Government now

19

operates, apparently you can only have an at-will

employment contract with a savings and loan.

21

To move on to the sue-and-be-sued language, we

22

believe that the Government's argument is a circular

23

argument with respect to the sue-and-be-sued language.

24

The Government identifies the appropriate statutes, and

25

the issue boils down to whether this action is cognizable

not under the Federal Tort Claims Act, as Mr. Bender

2

said -- 267 (a)

3

under 1346(b), and 1346(b) does not say torts, as the

4

Government would wish it says.

5

says the issue is whether it is cognizable

1346(b) says that actions cognizable under the

6

Federal tort claims actions are those actions for which a

7

private individual would be liable under local law.

8

don't believe we need to go beyond the wording of the

I

statute to look at the legislative history to interpret
10

11

that plain language.
The sue-and-be-sued clause and the Federal Tort

12

Claims Act draw the same distinction that we wish to draw.

13

That is, common law torts are covered by the Federal Tort

14

Claims Act, but those actions that are other than common

15

law torts are not cognizable, and if there is an

16

appropriate sue -and-be- sued clause, that gives

jurisdiction against a sue-and-be-sued agency.

If we agree with the Government that this claim must be

no Bivens action against a Federal agency, is that the end

of your case?

MR. FILICE:

Yes, except to the extent that it's

I believe that probably would be

the end of our case.

5

that in the footnote in our brief we make the point that a

number of judicial riders have commented that sovereign

immunity as a doctrine should not really be applied in

8

cases of constitutional torts.

9

not retain its medieval connotation that the sovereign

11

However, I would like to point out

Sovereign immunity does

cannot be sued merely because the king can do no wrong.
QUESTION:

Then you wipe out the entire -- the

12

Federal Tort Claims Act is beside the point, because the

13

immunity --we should go back and rethink the entire

14

immunity doctrine, but even if you -- even if we did that,

±5

you have a problem of extending Bivens to an agency,

16

something you conceded has never been done before.

17

Why aren't there the factors that counsel

hesitation here against extending Bivens to an agency when

19

that's never been done before, when the payment will have

20

to come out of the Federal fisc as distinguished from an

MR. FILICE:

I don't believe, Your Honor, that

MR. FILICE:

QUESTION:

Well -The question -- the issue of what is

assumed.

QUESTION:

Where does the gun come from?

You

don't have to reimburse these people.
MR. FILICE:

Well, the gun comes from the

5

practical consideration that if the Federal Government,

6

after the creation of Bivens, then had a policy that it

7

was not going to indemnify or provide a defense, which is

8

another expense to any of its employees that were charged
with Bivens actions, that would cause a tremendous morale

10

problem among Federal employees and would be, in a

11

practical sense, an impossible situation, so in fact --

12

QUESTION:

Well, it might cause timidity, and

13

that may be why the Government wants to pay the bill.

14

can understand that, but it still is a voluntary

assumption of a responsibility.

16

MR. FILICE:

I

Well, it's voluntary in a sense,

17

but it would cause timidity, or lack of zealousness in

Government employees, or lack of morale, and so in a

1

sense, when the court came down with the Bivens decision,

20

it wasn't directly impacting the Federal fisc, but in a

21

practical sense it was indirectly impacting the Federal

fisc, because it would be hard for me to believe that the

Government would ever take the position that it is never

employee liability, and it dealt with liability for common

12

law torts.

13

at when it passed that 1988 legislation.

14

at a situation involving Federal employees and common law

15

torts.

That was the problem that Congress was looking
It was looking

16

Congress made no attempt in the 1988

17

legislation, which you then construed in Smith, to look

18

one way at the other at sue-and-be-sued clauses, let alone

19

Federal agencies, and indeed, if we look at what Congress

20

did, I believe it is more consistent with our position,

21

namely what Congress did in the 1988 legislation was, they

22

drew a distinction between common law torts and

23

constitutional torts and said common law torts are

24

cognizable under the Federal Torts Claims Act and

25

constitutional torts are not.

QUESTION:

Well, but that's your theory, and it

2

may be factually distinguishable from Smith, but certainly

3

the entire analysis of Smith suggests that your definition

4

of cognizable is too narrow.

5

MR. FILICE:

Well, as the court of appeals

6

noted, it is difficult to interpret the sounds of

7

legislative silence.

8

the Government is talking about and seeking to draw

9

conclusions from, the Government -- the Congress did not

In the 1988 legislation, and what

10

in fact pass a completely symmetrical statute.

11

words, they dealt with employees, but they didn't deal

12

with agencies.

13

QUESTION:

In other

I'm not talking about the legislative

14

history of what happened in -- I'm talking about our

15

opinion in Smith, which assumes a much broader definition

16

of cognizable, I think, than you're willing to concede.

17

MR. FILICE:

Except that your definition, Your

18

Honor, respectfully, in the Smith case again dealt with

19

common law torts and with employees, and what you said in

20

Smith was, excluded common law torts, implicitly or

21

explicitly, excluded common law torts, would arguably

22

still be cognizable under the act.

23

But that is a different question than whether

24

constitutional torts are cognizable, and I think we have

25

to go back to 1346(b) to determine the answer to that

question, and the last sentence, or last phrase of 1346(b)

2

makes very clear what Congress' intent was.

3

intent was to recognize, to take cognizance of those

4

wrongs for which a private individual would be liable

5

under local law.

6

QUESTION:

Congress'

But at the time Congress legislated

7

1346(b), which was 1946, there were no such thing as

8

constitutional torts recognized.

9
10

MR. FILICE:
QUESTION:

That's true, but -You can argue one way or the other

11

from that, but just like you say that you can't really

12

draw much analysis from the 1946 action since Bivens came

13

much later, the whole idea of constitutional torts came

14

much later.

15

MR. FILICE:

That's true, and as a matter of

16

fact, the sue-and-be-sued clause was -- that we're talking

17

about for the FSLIC was drafted in the 1930's, but the

18

point we are making is, is this Court has held that sue-

19

and-be-sued clauses are to be liberally construed as

20

general waivers of sovereign immunity unless one of three

21

things occur, unless the suit in question is inconsistent

22

with the statutory scheme, unless an implied restriction

23

on the general waiver is necessary to avoid a grave

24

interference with a governmental -- performance of a

25

governmental function, or unless it was clearly the

1

purpose of Congress to use a sue-and-be-sued clause in a

2

narrow sense.

3

None of those three conditions exist here, so in

4

the 1930's when Congress created the FSLIC and decided how

5

broadly it would waive immunity for the FSLIC, at that

6

point in time, what Congress decided to do was, rather

7

than delineate all of the ways --

8

9
10

QUESTION:

With no thought at all, Mr. Filice,

of anything like a Bivens claim.
MR. FILICE:

That's true.

What Congress

11

intended to do, Your Honor, was to waive immunity

12

generally for that agency, subject to those exceptions

13

that may later occur.

14

Now, the Government has identified that later

15

came the Federal Tort Claims Act, and possibly the Federal

16

Tort Claims Act could have been written to exclude this

17

kind of an action.

18

Congress could today take a look at the issue, and could

19

say, we're also going to include constitutional torts

20

under the Federal Tort Claims Act with these rules, but

21

when Congress decided to launch this agency, Congress used

22

a broad waiver of sovereign immunity which waives all

23

immunity for the universe, subject to such exceptions as

24

may be made later on.

25

QUESTION:

It was not.

Congress could today --

1

liability if a private person would be liable to the

2

claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the

3

act or omission occurred.

4

Suppose you have a State that allows no recovery

5

for psychological torts.

6

Does that mean that psychological torts are not cognizable

7

under 1346(b), and therefore the Government is liable for

8

all cognizable torts?

9

MR. FILICE:

10

It must be physical injury.

Well, there is jurisprudence by

this Court that would say no, that that is cognizable.
QUESTION:

11

Right, and it seems to me you're

12

repudiating that jurisprudence.

13

MR. FILICE:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FILICE:

No.

No, the way I just --

Tell me why you're not.
The way I justify our position,

16

Your Honor, is that those actions are at least common law

17

torts.

18

could say it was clearly the purpose of Congress to

19

include within the Federal Tort Claims Act those actions

20

that are common law torts.

21

I think the Court could look at those actions and

That's the meaning of that last phrase, so that

22

if there is a common law tort that is not - - that is

23

accepted either implicitly or plicitly by the Federal Tort

24

Claims Act, then that still would be cognizable, but here

25

we're talking about constitutional torts.

QUESTION:

So the difference between you and the

Government is that the Government says cognizable means
all torts, and you say that cognizable means just common
law torts.

Is that what we're arguing about, essentially?
MR. FILICE:

I believe that is one way to put

it, Your Honor, yes.
QUESTION:
it seems to me.

There's little choice in rotten eggs,

Why shouldn't we take the Government's

unrealistic interpretation rather than your unrealistic -(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

It seems to me it means neither one

of those things.
MR. FILICE:

Well, we believe that our -- well,

I would say this about your hypothetical, your
hypothetical, while certainly I am duty bound to answer
it, is not the case that we have today.
QUESTION:

But you are asking us to extend the

Bivens doctrine to so far new territory.

Whatever the

tort claims act - - whatever our role with respect to that
is, the Bivens doctrine is a Court-created doctrine -MR. FILICE:
QUESTION:

Yes --- and you're asking us to extend

that to one class of agency uniquely.
MR. FILICE:

Yes, I am, and it's my position

that the logic of the Bivens action, namely, that this

1

Court has the primary duty to enforce constitutionally

2

protected rights, and that it should not be surprising

3

that Article III courts, in protecting constitutionally

4

protected rights, would turn to traditional judicial

5

remedies like damages to do that, applies with equal logic

6

to a sue-and-be-sued agency, and that sue-and-be-sued

7

agency has a waiver of sovereign immunity by Congress, so

8

I believe that -- I believe that your logic in Bivens

9

makes perfect sense for a sue-and-be-sued agency, and

10
11

there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity.
But to get back to what I was saying to Justice

12

Scalia, what I was trying to say was, perhaps my answer to

13

the hypothetical was nonsensical, but my answer to the

14

Government's position in this case makes sense.

15

how you read the language of that statute, 1346(b), you

16

can't squeeze in a constitutional claim.

17

says that it is concerned with wrongs for which a private

18

individual would be liable under local law, and that

19

cannot include a constitutional tort.
