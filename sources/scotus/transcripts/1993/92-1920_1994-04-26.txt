ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. McCRACKEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. McCRACKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is a challenge to the policy of the

11
12

California Labor Commissioner not to enforce the

13

California Labor Code on behalf of employees covered by

14

collective bargaining agreements providing for

15

arbitration.

16

This case arose on January 2nd, 1990, when the

17

petitioner, Karen Livadas, was terminated by her employer,

18

Safeway Stores.

19

termination of an employee, the employer must pay all of

20

the accrued wages due to the employee.

21

demanded, upon notice of her termination, that she be paid

22

everything she was owed, but her store manager told her

23

that she may not have it; that Safeway would instead mail

24

it to her.

25

California law requires that upon

Safeway did mail her a check, which she received

12

California law is to compel the employer to pay on time.

13

In addition to that policy, the California Labor Code has

14

also provided for many years that the Commissioner of

15

Labor has the responsibility to ensure that the penalties

16

are collected, that the law is enforced.

However, in this case the Commissioner, acting

pursuant to his policy, decided not to pursue this claim,

19

decided not to investigate it or to submit it either to

20

prosection in court or to a hearing in the administrative

21

procedures of the Labor Commissioner.

22

decision was solely because she is covered by a collective

23

bargaining agreement containing an arbitration clause.

24

There was never a question that the amount that she was

25

owed and was paid by Safeway was correct.

The reason for that

There was never

1

a dispute in this case that in any way involved the

2

collective bargaining agreement.
QUESTION:

3

The Labor Commissioner, Mr.

4

McCracken, never defended the policy on the basis that

5

people who aren't covered by collective bargaining

6

agreements really need more help from the State than

7

people who are covered by collective bargaining

8

agreements?
MR. McCRACKEN:

9

No, it was never defended on

10

that basis, only on the basis that the Labor Commissioner

11

felt that it was necessary to take this position in order

12

to avoid problems of labor law preemption.
QUESTION:

13

And --

Could he properly have defended it

14

upon the grounds that -- hypothesized by the Chief

15

Justice?

16

MR. McCRACKEN:

I don't believe so, because

17

the -- in this case the question is whether or not a

18

decision can be based upon the exercise of Federal rights,

19

in this case the right to select a collective bargaining

20

representative and have a collective bargaining agreement.

21

I don't believe that the State, however benign its

22

intentions, may classify its services based upon that

23

exercise, and that's what has happened here.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well that's, at any rate, something

you don't have to bite off, I take it.

MR. McCRACKEN:

defense to such a classification.

But even if it were, we don't

Mr. McCracken, you twice emphasized -

6

that there was no dispute about the amount due in this

7

particular case, but the respondent does emphasize -- and

8

I'm looking at page 42 of the brief -- that this is an

9

example of a class of cases, and that in some such cases,

10

at least, there would be a dispute about the amount.

For

11

example, it mentions the possibility of a penalty sum and

12

of vacation wages that might involve complex calculations

13

based on the specific provisions of a collective

14

bargaining agreement.

15

So suppose there were a dispute as to the amount

16

and that dispute turned on what the wage provisions of the

17

collective bargaining agreement meant?

18

MR. McCRACKEN:

Yes.

Justice Ginsburg, that

19

situation, we believe, would be answered by the approach

20

described by the Court in Lingle.

21

systems of law here, and they can work together.

22

Court described in Lingle what would happen in that

23

situation, namely that the State claim would be still

valid.

1

the question whether or not the employer had paid the

2

employee everything that was due upon termination.

3

This case involves what I consider to be the

4

more common class of cases, which is where there is total

5

nonpayment of the termination pay on the date of

6

termination, as opposed to a partial payment, but there's

7

a dispute about whether it was the correct amount.
Now, under California law, it is only necessary,

8

9

in order for there to be a willful failure to pay the

10

termination pay, that the employer have intentionally not

11

paid it.

12

bargaining process of the answer whether or not the amount

13

was correct, the Labor Commissioner would then have

14

decided a question of State law, which is whether the

15

intentional failure to pay everything that was due was a

16

willful violation and therefore cause for penalties.

17

And so upon return from the collective

QUESTION:

So what it boils down to is you're

18

saying every time you look to Federal law for an answer to

19

a question that arises in a State law action, you don't

20

have preemption.

21
22

23

MR. McCRACKEN:

That's correct.

Yes, we believe

that every time - QUESTION:

Well, is that what you're saying?

24

You would not have preemption even in the case where it's

25

highly questionable what the meaning of the collective

1

bargaining agreement is as to entitlement to vacation

2

wages?
MR. McCRACKEN:

3

In the case of termination pay

4

we believe that is absolutely correct, that what would

5

happen here is that the question of whether or not payment

6

had been made on time would always be open for State law

7

to resolve.

8

had been made is a question to be resolved in the

9

grievance and arbitration process under the collective

QUESTION:

11

But the two questions are connected.

12

You can't say -- you know, she'll say it hasn't been made

13

on time because you only gave me part of what I'm entitled

14

to.
MR. McCRACKEN:

MR. McCRACKEN:

would be true.

In that hypothetical case, that

hypothetical case?
MR. McCRACKEN:

You can't separate the two questions.

QUESTION:

Even though it involves an

interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement?
MR. McCRACKEN:

The Labor Commissioner would not

4

be interpreting the collective bargaining agreement.

5

Labor Commissioner would not go into the collective

6

bargaining agreement to resolve the question of whether or

7

not the employee had been paid everything due.

8

the Labor Commissioner would depend upon getting that

The

Instead,

knowledge from the grievance and arbitration process under
10

the collective bargaining agreement.

11

So, for instance, if the employee said I wasn't

12

paid everything I was due and filed a grievance about it,

13

and the resolution of the grievance was either the

14

employer agreed or an arbitrator ruled that, indeed, the

15

employer had not paid everything that was due, that

16

information would then go back to the Labor Commissioner,

17

who would then know, without having to interpret the

18

agreement himself, that, in fact, the employee had not

1

been paid everything that was due upon termination.

QUESTION:

So long as there's an arbitration

agreement in the collective bargaining agreement.
MR. McCRACKEN:

Either an arbitration agreement

or some other dispute resolution mechanism.
QUESTION:

Or some other mechanism.

why isn't this valid in all cases then?

However,

Why have we gone

1

through all this trouble of saying that there's

preemption?

3

preemption; the State simply has to wait for the dispute

resolution mechanism in the collective bargaining

5

agreement to play itself out?

Why couldn't we always say there's never

MR. McCRACKEN:

6

The -- in cases such as this,

7

there is no reason for anyone to resort to that process

8

because there was never any dispute under the agreement

9

about what was due.

10

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not talking about cases

11

like this.

I'm talking about cases where there is a

12

dispute.

13

the totality of cases?

14

just proposed applicable to all of these cases, so we

15

really shouldn't have had a preemption principle.

Why is this class of case any different from

MR. McCRACKEN:

17

that's taking it to far.

19
20

QUESTION:

Why isn't the solution that you've

Well, I think, Justice Scalia,
I think --

I think it is, but you tell me why it

is?
MR. McCRACKEN:

Because I think what the Court

21

was saying in Lingle, especially its description in

22

footnote 12 of how to resolve these problems of interplay

23

between the two systems, is that there are many occasions

24

in which it is necessary to get data from the collective

25

bargaining process.

1

For instance, in Lingle itself, the -- part of

2

the damages sought by the employee was back pay.

3

would have to be determined in accordance with the

4

collective bargaining agreement, because it set the rate

5

of pay and such things as vacation and holiday pay and

6

that type of thing.

7

should be preempted because the measurements of damages

8

for the tort requires some resort to the collective

9

bargaining agreement.

10

Back pay

One can't say that the State's tort

And as I understand, what the Court was saying

11

in that case is that, the collective bargaining agreement,

12

the process still operates, but it operates independently

13

of State law.

14

necessary for the resolution of such questions as damages,

15

and that's all we're really saying in this case.

16

But what it does is to provide information

there is a dispute as to the amount due?

20

about whether he worked 6 hours or 8 hours on Wednesday.

21

How does the -- California resolve that?

22

MR. McCRACKEN:

Say the employee

I believe, Mr. Justice Stevens,

23

that what happens is that the Commissioner looks at the

24

employer's payroll records to determine the answer to that

25

question, the same as the -11

QUESTION:

1

And if the player -- the employer has

2

underpaid him, as a based on that, then there's a penalty

3

imposed.

4

MR. McCRACKEN:

If what has happened is that

5

the -- that question, whether there's 2 hours' pay

6

missing, the Commissioner would investigate to see whether

7

the 2 hours were worked and whether the 2 hours were paid,

8

and then would find that there was underpayment, as a

9

matter of fact.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. McCRACKEN:

12

QUESTION:

13

And then impose the penalty.

But the penalty can't be imposed

unless it were willful.

14

MR. McCRACKEN:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

Correct.

Yes.

If the employer had a good-faith

doubt, there would be no penalty.
MR. McCRACKEN:

Well, the test under California

18

law, Justice Kennedy, is whether the nonpayment was

19

intentional.

Willful is equated to intentional under

QUESTION:

So if he had a good faith doubt,

there would be no penalty.
MR. McCRACKEN:

That's a matter for the

24

Commissioner to determine as a matter of State law.

25

view of it, having read the cases, is that if the employer

My

1

did have a good-faith doubt, that would be sufficient

2

reason to deny the penalties.

3

But if the situation were that the employer knew

4

that there was a question about how much pay was due but

5

made the intentional decision not to pay the disputed

6

amount and to make the employee go to whatever measures

7

were necessary in order to recover it, it seems to me it's

8

conceivable that under the Triad Data Services test for

9

willfulness, that that would still be willful, because it

10

was an intentional decision made by the employer.

11

again, that is a question of State law and not of Federal

12

law, how willful the decision was.

13

QUESTION:

But,

Yes, but it might bear on how these

14

two acts or how these two conflicting sovereignties bear

15

upon each other in a case where, as Justice Scalia put it,

16

the collective bargaining agreement is not clear.

17

MR. McCRACKEN:

Yes, I can see how it might,

18

because the degree of the employer's good faith would be,

19

in turn, somewhat conditioned by the merits of its

20

argument under the collective bargaining agreement that a

21

certain amount was not due.

22

that type of case, where there is partial nonpayment as

23

opposed to total nonpayment.

24

case, as is usually true, of total nonpayment.

25

certainly in that class of cases, it is not necessary to

And I can see that arising in

Nevertheless, this is a

And

1

evaluate willfulness or anything of the sort.
We also believe that the way to handle that

2

3

particular problem, Justice Kennedy, the one of the rare

4

case in which there may actually be some question of

5

contract interpretation that is at least tangentially

6

involved, is nevertheless for the Labor Commissioner to go

7

forward unless it is clear that the matter is preempted.

8

So that the question of preemption, that is whether the

9

claim is substantially dependent on analysis of the

10

collective bargaining agreement, can be resolved by the

11

California courts as -- if the employer raises it as a

12

defense.

13

QUESTION:

Is it true that, as a practical

14

matter, there's very little occasion to have a difference

15

of opinion as to the amount owed?

16

MR. McCRACKEN:

Yes.

I think that, in my

17

experience, that is a very uncommon situation, that

18

usually the amount owed on termination is quite clear, as

19

it was in this case, and that is the main class of cases

20

involving termination pay.

21

Commissioner's policy systematically excludes all those

22

claims from the enforcement services that the Commissioner

23

offers the rest of Californians, and that is the problem

24

in this case.

the
QUESTION:

Suppose we go back to Justice

Kennedy's original question, and suppose the California

law is clear that these sections, 201 and 203, don't apply

to people whose unit is covered by a collective bargaining

6

agreement but only for the particularly needy workers who

7

don't have a collective bargaining agreement governing

their employment relationship.

MR. McCRACKEN:

Yes, a violation of section 7

20

redressable through section 1983.

Section 7, of course,

21

is a somewhat unique section in Federal law in that it

22

gives an unqualified right to employees to exercise the

23

rights described in there -- therein, to select a

24

collective bargaining representative and to negotiate

collective.

It's a right that is good against all comers.

It is good against the State, against employers, against

unions, and even against the Federal Government.
QUESTION:

3

Well, supposing there's an election

plant vote not to have a collective bargaining agreement.

6

Now, they've exercised their rights under the Federal law

just the way that people have who have elected to have a

State could not, say, treat them the same as people who

have never had the opportunity to bargain?
MR. McCRACKEN:

11

We say, Mr. Justice -- Chief

12

Justice, that there is no way the State can take that

exercise into account either way, so that if employees had

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

1

MR. STEWART:

2

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

In this Court, respondent appears largely to

5

have abandoned the argument that he was prevented from

6

processing Ms. Livadas' claim by Federal preemption

7

principles.

8

nonprocessing is necessary to vindicate the State's

9

independent policy of respecting arbitration agreements

His argument, instead, is that his policy of

10

and holding parties to the terms of their contract.

11

we think this reflects a fundamental misconception of the

12

role of the labor arbitrator in a collective bargaining

13

situation.

14

And

This Court has repeatedly made clear that a

15

labor arbitrator operating under a collective bargaining

16

agreement has power only to enforce the terms of the

17

agreement, and the arbitrator does not have a general

18

authority to enforce the terms of public laws that the

19

parties have not incorporated into their contract.

20

Consequently, the result of the Labor

21

Commissioner's policy is not that Ms. Livadas will be

22

relegated to an arbitratal forum in order to pursue her

23

claim for penalties.

24

upon her union to take to arbitration her claim for

25

section 203 penalties, the arbitrator would undoubtedly

If Ms. Livadas somehow prevailed

1

deny relief because the late payment provisions of

2

California law have not been incorporated into the

3

collective bargaining agreement.

4

Consequently, the result will be that Ms.

5

Livadas lacks a remedy within the State system and lacks

6

an arbitral remedy as well.

7

that Ms. Livadas, and workers like her, will be deprived

8

of State law protections that are available to all other

9

employees within the State.

The consequence of that is

That seems to be precisely

10

the result that this Court discountenanced in Metropolitan

11

Life, when the Court said that a regime which would

12

exclude unionized workers or workers covered by collective

13

bargaining agreements from the reach of State minimum

14

standards laws, would be incompatible with the policies

15

animating the NLRA.

16

Second, I think that the kind of discrimination

17

that is effected here, that is an exclusion from State law

18

benefits for workers who are covered by collective

19

bargaining agreements is precisely what was at issue in

20

this Court's decision in Nash v. Florida Industrial

21

Commission.

22

who had been denied unemployment compensation under

23

Florida law because she had filed an unfair labor practice

The plaintiff in that case was an individual

1

the State of Florida should not be permitted to defeat or

2

handicap a valid national objective by threatening to

3

withdraw State benefits from persons simply because they

4

cooperate with the Government's constitutional plan.

5

Here, also, Ms. Livadas is being denied State

6

benefits otherwise available on the ground that she

7

exercised her Federal right to participate in collective

8

bargaining.

9

individuals who exercise section 7 rights may not be

I think Nash makes clear both that

10

penalized by the States for doing so, and makes clear, as

11

well, that the penalty may take the form of a withdrawal

12

of benefits that would otherwise be available under State

13

law.

14

And, finally, we believe that section 1983 is an

15

appropriate vehicle by which Ms. Livadas can vindicate her

16

Federal rights.

17

State, that State action which interferes with the

18

operation of the NLRA may form the basis for a section

no need to infer from the structure of the act a Federal

22

right.

This Court has made clear, in Golden

And, indeed, we think this is a much clearer
Here there's

23

Section 7 of the NLRA states explicitly that

24

employees shall have the right to engage in collective

25

bargaining and to join unions.

And to the extent that the

State's action penalizes Ms. Livadas for exercising that

right, section 1983 provides an appropriate remedy.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, that's easy for you to

say.

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

But it must be admitted that our law

7

on preemption is hard to figure out, at least as applied

8

to the concrete facts of particular cases.

9

Commissioner is arguing is, you know, cut me a little

And what the

10

slack; at least where there's arguable preemption, I ought

11

to be able to proceed in a reasonable fashion without

12

being subjected to a 1983 action.

13

Is it your contention that whenever he makes a

14

mistake as to whether there's preemption or not, he's

15

subject to being sued?

16

MR. STEWARTr

Well, if the mistake is simply

17

that he reasonably believed that what he was doing is

18

legal, that amounts to a claim of good-faith immunity

19

which has no application to official capacity suits.

20

he's making the claim that he reasonably and in good faith

21

believed that what he was doing was required by Federal

22

law, we think in this case there's no need to reach the

23

issue of whether that could furnish a defense.

24

25

example of when State authorities could interpret the

was necessary to look to the CBA in order to determine

So even if there was a good faith defense of the

Commissioner is going to have to decide what he's going to

10

Or is he going

where there is a dispute as to the amount of wages due?
MR. STEWART:

11

Well, clearly this Court may reach

12

cases in the future in which a State official has operated

13

on the basis of a preemption theory which was reasonable

14

at the time, but turned out to be wrong.

15

certainly no basis for the respondent's argument that even

16

though what he did may have been unreasonable,

17

nevertheless he ought to be protected because a case may

18

arise in the future in which the conduct was reasonable.

5

7

QUESTION:

It is quite clear, in the context

Would you say, then, there was a

8

basis for a reasonable belief for the cases in which the

9

amount due requires interpretation of the collective

10

bargaining contract?
MR. STEWART:

Well, if there were a situation in

12

which the employer paid upon termination and the dispute

13

was whether the employer had paid all the wages due, we

14

think that'd be a different sort of case, because it would

15

be a necessary step in Ms. Livadas' claim for penalties.

16

QUESTION:

Well, would it be the kind of case

17

about which Justice Scalia inquired that you are

18

unprepared to answer?

19

where there might be good faith, although wrong reliance

20

on a preemption notion?

21

MR. STEWART:

Would that be the kind of case

We think, in that context, the

22

arbitrator -- the Labor Commissioner would be entitled at

23

least to defer his proceedings until the arbitration

1

2

employee was entitled to additional wages, it wouldn't

3

necessarily follow that the employer was subject to

4

penalties, because the employer might have had a

reasonable good faith belief that all wages owed had been

7

QUESTION:

You're telling me that deferral of

is if it requires interpretation of the collective

11

California Department, never comes into the picture at

all.

13

MR. STEWART:

Well, what -- again, what we think

14

is unreasonable about the California Labor Commissioner's

15

policy is that it applies even when there is no dispute as

MR. CADELL:

believe that that's -- that's exactly what the second

that's really at issue here.

Yes.
But I'm trying to learn from you what

California law is, and I've not yet grasped it.
MR. CADELL:

I'm sorry, Your Honor.

California

11

law provides that if -- in the event that it's a willful

12

failure to pay, that a penalty arises.

13

229 of the California Labor Code, we feel, the second

14

sentence of section 229 precludes the Labor Commissioner,

15

procedurally precludes the Labor Commissioner -- we feel

16

precludes the State courts from going forward and

determining what the penalty is, because that penalty has

QUESTION:

Mr. Cadell, let me ask you a

21

practical question.

22

the Commissioner would be able, lawfully, to decline to

23

provide representation if it interpreted that second

24

sentence -- which says:

25

claims involving any dispute concerning the interpretation

Suppose this Court should decide that

"This section shall not apply to

or application of any collective bargaining agreement."
If it interpreted that sentence to mean that it

2

3

shall not apply to claims involving any dispute, as

4

opposed to claims that are undisputed as in this case,

5

suppose we were to say it would be okay in that event, so

that the only cases you don't provide representation are

cases where there is a real dispute about the amount due,

could you live with that?

QUESTION:

MR. CADELL:

Because I believe that -- I believe

law, but it puts you in the position, it seems to me, of

13

taking across the board -- in every case, without

14

determining the existence of a dispute or not, it puts

15

California in the position of running afoul, I would

suppose, of the -- of footnote 12 in Lingle, which

attempts to draw the line between what it is appropriate

for a State to do and what it is not appropriate for a

State to do in terms of Federal labor policy.

20

MR. CADELL:

But we look at footnote 12 in

21

Lingle, Your Honor, as drawing the outside boundaries of

22

where the State may go as far as preemption is concerned.

23

We don't look, or we didn't look at any rate, at the

preemption principle set down by this Court as delimiting

So 229 preemption is not coextensive,

in your view, with 301 preemption.

4

MR. CADELL:

No, it's not.

It's not

inconsistent with, we don't believe, but it's not

coextensive with.

7

QUESTION:

Let me ask you this.

Can the parties

8

in a collective bargaining agreement waive the provisions

9

of the California law on prompt payment?
MR. CADELL:

10

No, I don't believe they can, Your

11

Honor.

I believe, though, that they could, in fact,

12

provide for that particular problem coming up, that the

13

remedy would be to take it to the Labor Commissioner.

14

believe that's possible.
QUESTION:

15

I

Could they provide that the remedy is

16

not to take it to the Labor Commissioner, but to arbitrate

17

it?

18

MR. CADELL:

QUESTION:

Yes, they could do that as well.

And they talk about the

And the quote -It's at page 22, Your Honor.
The quote from Posner says "any

controversy under a collective bargaining contract."
MR. CADELL:

Yes, Your Honor.

And our position

10

is that the controversy is the amount of the penalty

11

that's required to be paid.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

But that's not under the collective

bargaining contract.
MR. CADELL:

No.

But the controversy -- the

right to it arises under the -- the right to receive that

16

wage rate and the duty to pay that wage rate arises under

17

the collective bargaining agreement.

18

QUESTION:

There's no controversy on that.

The

only controversy is whether the penalty is due, and that's

a controversy under State law apart from the collective
