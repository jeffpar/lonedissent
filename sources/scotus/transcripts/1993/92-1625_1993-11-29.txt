ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

10

MR. GOLD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case grows out of a strike and ensuing

11
12

equity proceeding to enjoin various kinds of wrongdoing

13

and a series of contempt proceedings which have generated

14

huge fines.

15

case is whether this -- these fines were criminal fines

16

which could only be imposed through criminal contempt and

17

through procedures which meet the requirements of criminal

18

due process, most particularly the right to jury.

19

The essential first question posed by the

This is not a new question in this Court, and we

20

rely on statements of the essential rules going back to

21

1911 in the Gompers case, and rules which have been

22

restated and reaffirmed as recently as the Fiat case in

23

485 U.S.

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, do you take the position

that the defendant has to continue to have an opportunity

1

to avoid payment of the fine in order for it to be

2

classified as civil?

3

MR. GOLD:

We think that that is --

4

QUESTION:

Is that a hard and fast test, in your

5

view, of this case?

6

MR. GOLD:

We think that that is one of the

7

underlying points which leads to what we understand to be

8

the basic point when you're dealing with fines and

9

imprisonment.

10
11

QUESTION:

But it's your position that that's a

requirement.

12

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

13

QUESTION:

How can that ever be coercive?

I

14

mean, if a defendant can always avoid it by eventually

15

doing the act.

16

MR. GOLD:

The -- when I say that it has to be

17

avoidable, what it -- what I understand the cases to say

18

is that in a situation in which a fine or a -- an

19

imprisonment is imposed in order to coerce an act, where

20

that is done to coerce a discrete affirmative act, there

21

is a sense in which the individual has -- to use the

22

phrase which runs from the beginning and the -- to the end

23

of these cases, has the keys to the prison or the -- to

24

his own strongbox in his hands, in a way which is

25

different from the situation in which there is a

1

prohibition and an alleged violation of the prohibition.

2

The effort is to secure a discrete act from the

3

individual.

4
5

QUESTION:

Well, if your response is that it

also depends upon whether it's mandatory or prohibitory --

6

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

7

QUESTION:

8

both types of things involved.

9

MR. GOLD:

-- I suppose in this case there were

Yes, and in that -- in that sense,

10

Justice O'Connor, the first of the arguments we make is

11

first because it raises the larger, more general question.

12

But it is, for our purposes, narrower in its effect than

13

the second argument we make on the effect of settlement.

14

QUESTION:

Well, in this case, this very case,

15

do you say that the fines could be imposed insofar as they

16

applied to those things that the union was asked to do

17

separate and apart from violent acts?

18

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

19

QUESTION:

Uh-hum.

20

MR. GOLD:

Yes.

We acknowledge -- we take the

21

sweet with the sour in terms of the law as it's developed,

22

a law which distinguishes between the ability of the

23

courts to coerce discrete acts that provide a unique
benefit to the plaintiff and rules which have to do with
the statement of prohibitions in court orders and the

levying of fines or imprisonment for violating those

2

orders.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, how much of the law that

5

you're talking about is constitutional law which would be

6

imposed on the States by the con, and how much of it is

7

just Federal court law.

8

a Federal court case.

9

MR. GOLD:

I mean, Gompers, for example, was

The opinion in Gompers talks about

10

the rules being rules of constitutional import having to

11

do with, as the phrase in the case, substantive rights and

12

constitutional privileges.

13

comes out of the California courts and applies the same

14

rules and the pivotal case for our purposes here, Bloom v.

15

Illinois, is a constitutional case.

16

And certainly Hicks v. Fiat

We understand the test or the general rule that is

17

stated in Gompers and reaffirmed in Hicks, to have three

18

wellsprings and to serve three purposes.

19

captures the essence of the historic distinction between

20

criminal contempt and civil contempt.

21

proper cognizance, as Gompers says, of the substantive

22

rights and constitutional privileges at stake.

23

finally, as Bloom emphasizes, it gives due weight to the

24

apprehensions about an unbridled contempt power that --

1

enjoins a distinction between the mandatory provisions of

2

an injunction and the, you know, prohibitive, prohibitory.

3

The -- I thought that distinction was pretty much

4

discounted.

5

MR. GOLD:

I can only judge by our understanding

6

of the words in the U.S. reports.

7

which serves to demark the line between criminal contempt,

8

which is governed by criminal due process requirements.

9

QUESTION:

The distinction is one

But isn't it a fact, Mr. Gold, that a

10

court can turn anything from mandatory into prohibitory

11

just by a matter of phrasing?

12

MR. GOLD:

I -- well, two -- two points on that,

13

Mr. Chief Justice.

14

prohibitory, as this Court has talked about, and it is the

15

distinction between prohibiting someone from acting in a

16

way which is harmful or wrongful and ordering someone to

17

act in a -- do particular discrete acts.

18

QUESTION:

One, when we talk about mandatory and

Mr. Gold, in that respect, are you

19

saying -- are you saying that a stop order can never be

20

enforced except through a criminal contempt process.

21

MR. GOLD:

No, Your --

22

QUESTION:

There were examples given by your

23

opponent for -- in the brief.

24

Operation Rescue injunctions were others.

25

under what circumstances a stop order can be enforced

The Patco case was one, the

Can you say

1

§2

without a criminal contempt proceeding?

What is the

dividing line between when a stop order can be enforced

3

and when it requires a separate criminal contempt

4

proceeding?

5

MR. GOLD: Two -- two points, Justice Ginsburg.

6

First of all, we believe these distinctions that we're

7

discussing here, and which are labeled prohibitory and

8

mandatory and, as you say, involve stop orders, deal with

9

the question of fines and imprisonment.

There are

10

other -- obviously, there are other ways to back up a stop

11

order, various kinds of compensatory and remedial orders

12

which are designed to provide the complaining party with

13

the rights and benefits that the order specifies.

14

®L5

Secondly, the stop order can be backed up by
various well crafted, affirmative orders which can be

16

enforced through coercive means under the established

17

tests.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Gold, are you --

19

QUESTION:

Was Patco such a case?

20

MR. GOLD:

Well --

21

QUESTION:

Wasn't that a fine per day?

22

MR. GOLD:

I'm not familiar with the particulars

23

25

of the Patco orders.

Well, do you take the position that

that cannot be enforced with a coercive and still civil

fine for each day in which they refuse to return?

MR. GOLD:

Yes, Your Honor.

And whether it is

not to -- whether -QUESTION:

You take -- I'm sorry.

You take the

7

position that that is not a -- that that enforcement is

8

not subject to a civil coercive fine?

9

MR. GOLD:

Correct.

10

QUESTION:

Suppose the judge says, go back to

11

work instead of, stop striking?

12

difference?

Does that make a

MR. GOLD:

The -- I think the answer is no.

14

QUESTION:

Why?

15

17
18

It seems to me one's

prohibitory, the other's -- the other's mandatory.
MR. GOLD:

The underlying point is prohibitory.

It seems to -- and I would say -QUESTION:

Why do you say that?

know -- I mean what the judge wants is to get these people

back to work.

terms of the underlying theory of the distinction, Justice

2

Scalia.

order -- instead of phrasing an order not to take action

4

which is injurious to the plaintiff, you can say only do

5

things which are beneficial to the plaintiff, or do not do

6

things.

7

can only say that against a background where the criminal

8

law is a law of prohibition enforced through retribution

and deterrence, the test is a test which is as sound as

The -- in the same way as you've just stated, an

But the underlying point remains the same, and I

can be divined.
After all, Gompers itself was a boycott case.

12

The Court had no trouble distinguishing between

13

prohibiting boycotting activity, which could be phrased

14

affirmatively or negatively --

15

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Gold, is doesn't seem to me

16

that the mandatory prohibitory distinction upon which you

17

seem to think the whole case turns has any underlying

18

connection with the constitutional values that are at

19

stake here.

20

some other tests for us, such as whether or not the

21

sanction is prospective or retroactive, backward looking,

22

forward looking, ad hoc, something like that.

23

mandatory-prohibitory distinction, it seems to me, is

24

rooted, to be sure, in what we have said in the cases, but

25

that doesn't seem to resonate in any of the underlying

I should have thought you could have devised

But the

1

constitutional values that are at stake here.
MR. GOLD:

2

Well, I think the argument for this

distinction is very much like the Churchillian argument

for democracy; it is superior to the alternatives.

Justice Kennedy prefaced his comment with

13

MR. GOLD:

What are you

In terms of our first argument, we

14

are left with nothing other than the complete lack of any

15

principle differentiating content in the standard applied

16

by the Virginia courts and urged by the respondents.

17

According to them, whether the underlying order is

18

prohibitory or mandatory, whether it has the essence and

19

substance of traditional criminal law, whether it is

20

enforced by fines or imprisonment, so long as, quote, the

21

penalty is scheduled in advance, it is civil, and if it is

22

not, it is criminal.

23

The prohibitory-mandatory approach is an effort

24

to deal with a certain measure of overlap between the

25

purposes and effect of a, quote, coercive fine or a

1

coercive imprisonment, and a, quote, criminal fine or

2

criminal imprisonment, and recognizes that both have

3

elements of providing benefit to the plaintiff,

4

vindicating the authority of the law and providing

5

measures of retribution and deterrence.

6

QUESTION:

And if --

If the Court is unwilling to draw a

7

line between acting and not acting, what is the remainder

8

of your argument on why these particular fines should be

9

classed criminal?

10

MR. GOLD:

Our view is that if that line is

11

rejected, then you have to go to the highest level

12

distinction, which is the distinction between proceedings

13

which are to vindicate the authority of the courts and the

14

law, versus proceedings which are to provide a definite

15

unique benefit to the plaintiff that is, in a real sense,

16

different from the overall effort to maintain peace and

17

social value.

18

QUESTION:

Ex ante or ex post?

I mean, ex ante

19

when the fines are announced, if you do this thing you

20

will pay a fine, they are for the benefit of the

21

plaintiff, to protect the plaintiff from the harm that

22

doing that unlawful thing would produce.

23

acts are done, the plaintiffs have already been -- and

24

then the fine is imposed.

MR. GOLD:

But once the

QUESTION:

1

2

You could say at that point there's

nothing left but vindication of the court.

3

MR. GOLD:

I think that, far better than I've

4

been able to do so far, that exposes the nature of the

5

problem.

6

not harm the plaintiff, and say if you do, you will be

7

fined $100,000 -- to say that that is a situation which is

8

different from the following:

9

do not harm the plaintiff, actions are taken which harm

10

the plaintiff, a proceeding is begun in contempt, and a

11

fine of $100,000 is imposed.

12

To say that if, ex ante, you enter an order, do

you enter an order saying

To say that those are different, the first

13

civil, the second has always been criminal, is to deny

14

that the criminal law, with the sentencing guidelines and

15

other statement, prior statements of both the norm and the

16

sanction, is somehow civil.

17

the underlying constitutional values, which we have not

18

talked about, and I am only going to talk about for a

19

minute, completely unprotected.

20

And that, we think, leaves

After all, there are two social values here.

21

One, the basic social values which provide a heightened

22

degree of due process for the imposition of certain forms

23

of penalties.

24

contempt procedure, which is one which conflates all the

25

power of Government into a single individual which varies

And secondly, the particular concern of the

SUITE 400

(800) FOR DEPO

1

in a way which is contrary to the whole notion of

2

protecting against improper incursions on liberty by

3

separating the powers of Government.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what you speak of as the single

5

individual is, in fact, the court.

And the court, in

6

fact, has a position in these cases which is different

7

from the court in a normal criminal case, or indeed from a

8

normal civil case.

9

by issuing an injunction, has become an actor and, in

Because the court, in effect, has --

10

effect, has created a public stake which doesn't exist in

11

your two other extreme examples.

12

So there's nothing unreasonable, on the face of

13

it, to say that there should be a particular process, and

14

not necessarily a criminal one, to protect that -- that

15

third and different interest.

16

MR. GOLD:

The history of the doctrine, to date,

17

has been, as we understand it, precisely the opposite,

18

Justice Souter.

19

that the judge issued the order creates grave risks that,

20

in dealing with --

It has been the recognition that the fact

21

QUESTION:

Oh, I will grant you that it does

22

create grave risks.

23

that the existence of that risk is not dispositive,

24

because that risk is still, as it were, sort of the

25

unfortunate reflection of a third interest which does not

But I'm saying -- all I'm saying is

occur in the run of the mill criminal case or the run of

2

the mill civil case.
MR. GOLD:

3

I'd like to move on to the second

4

argument.

5

true, there is no room for a criminal contempt.

6

the starting point of every case in this Court, from

7

Gompers through Dixon, is that there is an area of --

8

called criminal contempt which must proceed under

9

constitutional due process standards.

10
11
12

13

Before I do, let me simply say that if that's
And it is

Let me talk about the second question presented.
In the second question -QUESTION:

Can I ask you a question about the

second question?

14

MR. GOLD:

Absolutely.

15

QUESTION:

Is it your position that despite all

16

of the characteristics which exist that you say would make

17

this a criminal proceeding, it can be converted into a

18

civil proceeding so long as the State court announces when

19

it's imposes, of course, you know, even if you violate

20

these orders and incur liability for the fines, you'll be

21

able to settle?

22

willing to waive the fines, the fines will be waived, is

23

that enough to convert what might otherwise be a criminal

24

process, according to your analysis, into a civil?

25

If you settle and the plaintiff is

1

think, is -- of the process is the respondents'.

But in

2

terms of your point, we do believe that if you look at the

3

most general proposition, that criminal contempt is to

4

vindicate the authority of the law and the court, versus

5

civil contempt, which is to bring about the benefits of

6

the order to the plaintiff in a remedial fashion, then

7

law, any rule which says that the plaintiff is not master

8

of the case and cannot settle it and it is not inherent in

9

the case, that satisfaction to the plaintiff is not

10

enough, is a hallmark of criminal contempt, if there is no

11

other hallmark of criminal contempt.

12

QUESTION:

13

versa question.

14

it becomes civil.

And vice versa.

I asked you the vice

Likewise, if the plaintiff can waive it,

15

MR. GOLD:

We would not --

16

QUESTION:

Or if you say A, you have to say B,

17
18

Mr. Gold, don't you?
MR. GOLD:

Well, we would say that any case --

19

we would say that any case in which the plaintiff can

20

waive -- let me just put it in these terms.

21

thought of it exactly as you said it, but it is true, from

22

Gompers on, that criminal contempt cannot be settled by

23

the putative private plaintiff, and in that sense I agree

24

totally with what you said.

And when the judge says this is what I think it will take

I'm not sure why its narrowing makes it coercive, and I

MR. ROBERTS:

Well, the extra element starts,

first, with the fact that there's been a violation of the

10

injunction already.

This is not just the general citizen

him.

But if a judge is sentencing

an individual for a violation of the criminal law and says

you, that doesn't convert the second proceeding, if he

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL BENDER

20

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

23

MR. BENDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court's cases have steadily recognized, and

24

I think everybody in this case agrees, that the

25

traditional use of civil contempt to coerce a recalcitrant

party or witness into doing something that the court wants

2

them to do, traditionally by putting him in jail until he

3

does it, more recently by fines that accumulate until he

4

or she does it, that that's constitutional, whether done

5

in a State or Federal court.

6

The question in this case, as -- I think the

7

central question in this case, as Justice Ginsburg

8

mentioned at the outset of the argument, is with

9

prohibitory injunctions, where do we draw the line between

10

those which are constitutional and those which are not?

11

That there are constitutional rules I think is reflected

12

in this Court's decision in Hicks, which was a State case

13

and which mentioned that there are constitutional rules.

14

QUESTION:

Well then, what are those rules?

15

it a matter of the Due Process Clause and is it

16

procedural?

17

MR. BENDER:

Is

I think it's a matter of due

18

process and I think it is procedural, yes.

19

Government's position in this case is that in addition to

20

the traditional use of civil contempt in the coercive

21

manner I just mentioned, there are at least two other

22

areas where civil contempt has traditionally been used and

23

which this Court should recognize as being constitutional

24

uses of civil contempt.

25

The

One the Court has explicitly recognized over and

1

over again, and that is that civil contempt can be used in

2

civil litigation to compensate a party for damages done to

3

that party by the other party who violates the injunction.

4

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Bender, let me interrupt

5

you for a moment.

You say a constitutional use of civil

6

contempt, but it's quite possible to read our cases, is it

7

not, as saying that the distinction between -- there is a

8

constitutional decision between criminal contempt and

9

civil contempt, because criminal contempt requires the

10

invocation of certain procedural safeguards, like a jury

11

trial?

12

some constitutional limitation on civil contempt at all.

13

But I don't read that as connoting that there's

MR. BENDER:

It may not be, and it may be that

14

any time a judge announces that he is proceeding by way of

15

civil contempt and that the penalties are going to be

16

imposed civilly, that that's constitutional.

17

QUESTION:

Even --

Well, is it just a matter of how the

18

judge characterizes it?

19

can -- you can describe and say if you have that, it's got

20

to be criminal?

21

MR. BENDER:

Isn't there something that we

Yes.

I think it's easier to look

22

at it in terms of some things which, if they're present,

23

it's clear that you can operate civilly.

24

case falls within one of those categories.

25

QUESTION:

And I think this

How about describing what falls on

MR. BENDER:

Well, essentially, what falls on

the other side of the line are prohibitory, if there is

4

another side of the line.

5

Rehnquist points out, it's conceivable that this Court

6

could hold that any time a judge characterizes the

7

proceedings as civil, they should be treated -- that

8

should be treated as constitutional.

9

And I think as Chief Justice

There are benefits to the -QUESTION:

10

Well, what do you with the old

11

distinction between a judge can act on the spot if a

12

contempt is committed in the judge's presence, but if it's

13

not in the judge's presence, then it has to be enforced

14

through a criminal procedure?

15

MR. BENDER:

16

QUESTION:

17

I think even -Do we wipe that out and say if the

judge calls it civil, it's civil?

18

MR. BENDER:

My own view is that there is a core

19

of contempt which must be treated criminally.

20

that core,

21

the kinds of acts which have traditionally been treated

22

criminally by the law.

23

category would be punishments like going to jail for

24

committing such an act.

25

And within

I would think, are acts which are malum in se,

contempt is an act that's malum in se?
MR. BENDER:

3

It's --

I don't think --

4
5

No, it's not a definition.

QUESTION:

Is there a definition of criminal

contempt?
MR. BENDER:

6

Yeah, and I think it is -- I think

7

it's better to put it the other way around, that there are

8

at least two categories of cases --

9

QUESTION:
MR. BENDER:

10

Well, we'll take it either way.
All right.

I think there are at

11

least two categories of cases where civil contempt can be

12

used by a court.

13

of the parties.

14

to cut down your neighbor's trees, and you nevertheless go

15

ahead and cut down your neighbor's trees, one thing the

judge can do,

17

contempt damages, compensatory damages for what you did.

One is where it's used to compensate one

us.

20

proceedings which are civil, you can haven even punitive

21

damages.

22

the Court has recognized over and over again that the

23

compensatory use of civil contempt is also constitutional.

24
25

It's very similar to tort damages.

On tort

So the use of civil contempt in that situation,

There's a second category which I think is
closer to this case, and which is, I think, the leading

1

example of it, is the National Labor Relations Board's use

2

of civil contempt.

3

over again, there are areas of regulation of conduct that

4

the Government may proceed in civilly rather than

criminally.

7

Board cases show that most prominently.

The Court's OSHA cases show that, for

As this Court has recognized over and

Republic Steel, the Act is essentially remedial; it does

10

not carry a penal program.

for a legislature to decide to regulate something civilly,

and labor relations are one of the prime areas where that

13

is possible.

14

constitutionally be given the power itself to levy civil

15

penalties for violations of the Act.

16

It is perfectly constitutional

So the National Labor Relations Board could

QUESTION:

So the Board, in effect, can do just

17

what you were saying or suggesting the judge might be able

18

to do at the beginning, and that is to say we're telling

19

you right now that when we coerce, it's civil coercion.

20

And that announcement, that labeling is sufficient.
MR. BENDER:

21

Congress' labeling, I think,

22

clearly is sufficient.

23

Board, we want you to act civilly rather than criminally.

24

And there are lots of reasons why Congress might want to

25

do that.

If Congress says, as it has to the

QUESTION:

1

What if -- what if a judge announces

2

this labeling and he says, look, I'm not going to mix

3

myself up in this labor dispute or this custody dispute.

4

I'm simply going to issue the order, and at some point

5

it's going to be resolved, but I'm telling you right now

6

that if you do not do what I order you to do, or if you

7

fail or if you do what I order you not to do, when it's

8

all over I'm going to levy fines on the following fine

9

schedule, and they're -- they're going to be -- they're

10

just going to be civil fines, I'm telling you that right

11

now.

12

character?

Is that sufficient to give it a conclusively civil

MR. BENDER:

I think it clearly is in a

nothing left to converse -- to coerce.

Even though there's nothing --

MR. BENDER:

Yes.

Yeah, the National Labor

QUESTION:

20

Mr. Bender, there -- there are

21

scholars who think that that was a great mistake, our line

22

of decisions which allowed administrative agencies, at the

23

direction of Congress or not, to avoid the right to jury

25

penalties.

MR. BENDER:

It's serious enough to

I don't think you do either to a

6

characterizes its procedures as civil, the Court ought to

defer to that unless it's clearly shown that they aren't

8

civil in character.

9

QUESTION:

But this case involves a

Mr. Bender, suppose the State didn't

10

have the civil party in this case.

11

owners hadn't sued for an injunction, but there's all this

12

violence that's very dangerous for the community going on,

13

and so the State of Virginia wants to stop it; what kind

14

of proceeding would you have to have?

15

MR. BENDER:

Suppose the mine

I think the State could do what the

16

Federal Government has done and decide to deal with that

17

kind of a behavior in a strike situation civilly rather

18

than criminally, and pass a statute authorizing a State

19

agency, and I think authorizing the agency to go to court

20

for enforcement of its orders, to operate civilly rather

21

than criminally, because that's the kind of thing where

22

that choice is available.

23

This case is more difficult than that because in

24

this case the State doesn't have a statute like that.

25

the judge said at the outset that he was proceeding

But

civilly; I think trying to do it in the same way the

2

National Labor Relations Board --

3

QUESTION:

Since he didn't have a statutory

4

regime like that, the characterization of this case as

5

civil, then, depends on the existence of a civil party.

6

MR. BENDER:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.
And if that's so, then when the civil

8

party departs and says I'm through, then how can the State

9

continue to maintain that it's civil?

10

MR. BENDER:

The government can be a civil

11

party, and the State in this case, or the judge in this

12

case treated -- and so did the Virginia Supreme Court,

13

treated the governments, the county and the State, as

14

being parties to the case.

15

think it's unconstitutional.

16

judge did here was treat the governmental entities as

17

civil parties, and he decided he was proceeding by way of

18

civil procedures in the same way the National Labor

19

Relations Board proceeded against exactly the same strike

20

by way of Federal civil proceedings.

22

QUESTION:

That's unusual, but I don't

1

The question in this case is whether it's constitutional

2

for the State to do that.

3

Has the State passed the line?

And the Court

4

said in Hicks that there are constitutional rules, but we

5

don't find the State has violated them unless it's

extremely clear that the State has violated them.

question for the Court in this case is whether it is that

extremely clear?

QUESTION:

And the

And our model of constitutionality is

going to be civil fines by administrative agencies.
MR. BENDER:

11

That is a constitutional way of

12

using civil contempt, yes.

And since it has been -- it

13

has been happening and used by the Federal Government for

14

many, many years, I don't think you can say that the State

15

is automatically disentitled to do that.

this case is whether the State has done things in enough

of a similar way?
