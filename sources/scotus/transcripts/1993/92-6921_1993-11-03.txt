ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER J. THOMPSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. THOMPSON:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case comes before the Court on a writ of

11

certiorari from the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

12

There, the Eleventh Circuit held that recusal motions of

13

Federal judges under 28 United States Code section 455(a)

14

have to be considered with the extrajudicial source

15

requirement and therefore the arguments concerning a

16

judge's conduct in the courtroom were improper and they

17

did not need to be considered in terms of such a motion,

18

and therefore affirmed the conviction of my three clients.

19

In 1983, by way of background as to these

20

convictions and to this motion to recuse, Father

21

Bourgeois, Father Rosebaugh, and Ms. Ventimiglia were

22

arrested and convicted in Georgia of various petty

23

misdemeanors before the Honorable J. Robert Elliott in the

24

Middle District of Georgia.

25

QUESTION:

If they were petty misdemeanors, how

did they get into Federal court?

type of thing?

MR. THOMPSON:

It was.

It was a Federal

reservation on the Fort Benning base.
So because they were petty misdemeanors, Chief

6

Justice, it was a bench trial.

7

generated a transcript.

8

no appeal from that case.

9

Was it a Federal enclave

That bench trial obviously

There were sentences.

There was

In 1991, Father Bourgeois, Charles Liteky and

10

Pat Liteky were charged again with regard to activities on

11

the Fort Benning military base, this time with a felony,

12

and as a result of that indictment were brought before

13

Judge Elliott, the same judge who had presided at the 1983

14

case, and filed a motion to recuse Judge Elliott based

15

largely, in fact almost exclusively, on his conduct in the

16

1983 case and attached as part of that motion not only

17

argument but a transcript of the 1983 proceeding.

18

Judge Elliott denied the motion, rejected the

19

motion, citing the leading Fifth Circuit and Eleventh

20

Circuit cases which have an extrajudicial source

21

requirement for 455 Federal recusal motions and indicated

22

because the events that were alleged requiring the recusal

23

arose in the courtroom, that is, part of the judicial

24

proceedings, that judicial conduct need not be considered

25

under 455(a).

QUESTION:

After the recusal motion was

Mr. Thompson, was there an appeal in

the -- in the 1 83 case, was there any appeal?
MR. THOMPSON:

8

There was not in the 1 83 case,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

10

Isn't there some concern here that

11

the recusal motion is being used to substitute for, to do

12

service for an appeal objecting to the fairness of the

13

trial in 1 83?
MR. THOMPSON:

14

Justice Ginsburg, there is not a

15

concern that I've seen raised by the Government in this

16

case concerning that.
QUESTION:

17

There was - Well, in allowing a litigant to rely

18

on conduct in a prior trial when that judgment wasn't

1

appealed, allow that many years later to come up in the

20

guise of a recusal motion, is -- perhaps that's the reason

21

why courts have said they're not going to entertain what

22

might be regarded as a substitute for an appeal in this

23

form.

24

MR. THOMPSON:

Your Honor, I don't think that

would be a substitute for the appeal because it would be

1

governed by substantially different standards.
That is, if there had been a direct appeal to

2

3

the Eleventh Circuit in 1983 on fair trail grounds, it

4

would be judged by abuse of discretion, whereas that

5

appeal conceivably and academically could be lost, and it

6

could still arise under 455(a) to a possibility or a

7

reasonable doubt as to partiality under that statute and

8

require recusal, even though there had been an affirmance

9

in 1983, so I don't think those are exact comparable

10

issues.

11

The face of

QUESTION:

Now, the challenge here was brought

13

under 455(a), is that correct, not under any of the

14

provisions of 455(b)?

15

MR. THOMPSON:

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

That's -- the petition for this writ of certiorari is

17

limited to 455(a).

18

QUESTION:

And would you think that the facts

19

here as you allege them to be would also be sufficient to

20

amount to something that could be challenged under

21

455(b)(1), which is the personal bias or prejudice

22

concerning a party?

23

MR. THOMPSON:

I do not, Your Honor, because

24

personal bias or prejudice since United States v. Grinnell

25

in 1966 means extrajudicial conduct, and I think that -6

I accept that.

So you're trying to fit this under

the whether the impartiality might reasonably be

questioned standard.

8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

QUESTION:

Thank you.

MR. THOMPSON:

10

Exactly.

And I think the face of the

11

statute supports exactly that distinction, and that is

12

really, I think, what clearly is to be decided here.

13

The statute reads, "Any justice, judge, or

14

magistrate of the United States shall disqualify himself

15

in any proceeding in which his impartiality might

16

reasonably be questioned."

17

455(b) says.

18

Personal has been held to be the extrajudicial source

19

requirement.

many good policy reasons that are enunciated by this Court

21

in Liljeberg and by Congress to apply to any conduct of

22

the judge.

It doesn't say personal, as

It doesn't say personal, as to 144 says.

In other words, the source of the bias, whether

24

it be through judicial conduct or through extrajudicial

25

conduct, is totally irrelevant.

1

court system and the integrity of the judiciary that if

2

there is bias, it need be considered.
QUESTION:

3

Well, what -- now, let's find out

4

what kind of bias we're talking about.

5

you're in a many-judge trial court and, as is common, some

6

of those judges have a reputation for being proplaintiff

7

in personal injury cases, and some have a reputation for

8

being prodefendant.

9

be attacked by this section?

Is that the sort of bias that could

MR. THOMPSON:

10

Supposing that

Mr. Chief Justice, it is not, in

11

my view.

12

proclivities or philosophies are not bias.

13

is not the manner of ruling in a particular case or the

14

judgments in a case.

15

engages in which indicates a kind of inclination or

16

favoritism or hostility, or some of those kinds of things,

17

against or for a party which would render a reasonable

18

person to question impartiality.

20

In other words, those sort of judicial

It is the conduct that a judge

And not a disfavor or dislike of a

particular kind of lawsuit.

21

MR. THOMPSON:

22

QUESTION:

Not at all.

In fact --

There is some overlap between the

23

fairness of the trial, because the things that you -- if

24

you have a biased judge, certainly you don't have a fair

25

trial, and so you are asking this judge to go over making

1

this decision, the record of an old trial, in somewhat of

2

the manner that a court of appeals would review it to

3

determine if the trial had been fair.

4

It may -- I agree with you that they're not

5

identical, but there is a considerable overlap.

6

you're asking this trial judge to kind of sit in judgment

7

on his own performance, some similarity to what a court of

8

appeals would have done if you had appealed the original

9

conviction and said I didn't get a fair trial.

10

MR. THOMPSON:

What --

Justice Ginsburg, I think there

11

is substantial similarity.

the same sort of facts.

14

be that the judge would not only be looking at the

15

transcript with a view toward whether or not they are

16

biased, or lack impartiality.

17

in the next case.

18

The judge would be looking at

their own standard, viewpoint, as a reasonable person,

22

whether that reasonable person would then harbor a doubt

23

as to their impartiality, and so it makes sense in a way,

24

although difficult for a judge to do it him or herself,

25

because by looking at it, the judge may think that the

Not from

1

actions were justifiable but may reflect and may have

2

their recollections so refreshed that they would think

3

perhaps if a reasonable person was sitting it might look

4

as if I shouldn't then sit in this next case.
QUESTION:

5

It would have to be the appearance,

6

because a judge takes an oath to-administer justice

7

without respect to persons.

8

the judge would be duty-bound to recuse, so what you're

9

suggesting is, although the judge knows he isn't biased,

If a judge couldn't do that,

10

that he's supposed to read an old transcript to determine

11

whether somebody, some reasonable viewer might think she

12

was.

13

MR. THOMPSON:

Exactly, and that's exactly why

14

455(a) was passed, because at the time it was passed, it

15

was passed to conform with the Code of Judicial Conduct

16

which had just been passed by the American Bar

17

Association, which incorporated for the first time in

18

these statutes an appearance of impropriety standard

19

rather than actual bias.

20

QUESTION:

Is there -- let me ask you another

21

question about the kind of bias we're talking about.

22

it limited to the situation where the claim is made that a

23

judge would disfavor the litigant in making the affidavit

24

in a way that he would not disfavor another litigant who

25

had exactly the same sort of legal claim?

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know

2

if -- under 455(a) the affidavit is not required.

That's

3

required under 144.

4

actually makes the recusal motion would go beyond where we

5

are asserting the Court should really draw the line.

6

other words, the process itself of filing the motion to

7

recuse for a practicing lawyer certainly would be

8

something not done lightly and be done with great

9

consideration, but what I am saying is that proceedings

I think whether or not the person

In

10

that occurred before then in court which were judicial in

11

nature should be considered by the judge in passing on the

12

motion.

13

QUESTION:

Well, what I'm -- I think what I'm

14

trying to get at is something a little different.

15

Supposing that you could show that Judge Elliott treated

16

your clients in your view hostilely, and that a reasonable

17

person would think it was, but that it was also -- it

18

could also be shown that he treated virtually all people

19

who were arrested for protesting at Fort Benning, if there

20

were a number of them, the same way.

21

sufficient?

22

MR. THOMPSON:

Now, would that be

I'm not sure if that would be

23

sufficient.

It would certainly be probative, and if a

24

pattern of conduct could be established that in every case

25

where someone who was in the same position of the

1

defendant in those situations, it would be probative as to

2

bias, but --

3

QUESTION:

Well then, where do you draw the line

4

between that and someone who is not at all friendly to

5

plaintiffs' personal injury suits but treats all

6

plaintiffs, personal injury plaintiffs, with equal

7

"hostility"?

8

MR. THOMPSON:

9

Honor, I think is very difficult.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Where you draw the lines, Your

Certainly the way you're going at it

I think it is.
MR. THOMPSON:

I think -- you know, Congress, by

13

passing this statute, a broad statute like this, basically

14

indicated that it may be very difficult to make these

15

determinations.

16

I don't --

QUESTION:

Whether it's difficult in a

17

particular case for a judge to make it, I certainly agree

18

with you, but don't we have to have some uniform

19

definition of bias before we can get at the reasonableness

20

and so forth, which may be very difficult?

21

MR. THOMPSON:

I was reviewing on Sunday

22

afternoon some of the cases and articles, and I wrote out,

23

although I wasn't asked to and it wasn't part of the tasks

24

for the briefs, because I thought this might come up, a

25

definition of bias as I think it would fit into the
12

1

standards that were applicable in 455(a), and what I came

2

up with was this:

3

reasonable person to question whether the judge's

4

inclination or state of mind toward a party belies favor

5

or aversion of a degree or kind that might affect the

6

judge's impartiality in the case.
I think a more exacting definition of bias or of

7
8

circumstances that would lead a

the standard, or to anticipate all the different ways in
which it could come up, such as the Court's hypothetical

10

about protestors at Fort Benning, would be almost

11

impossible, and it needs to, of course, be handled on a

12

case-by-case basis.

13

QUESTION:

14

Chief Justice disclosed this.

15

proposing is, it doesn't just open up every prior trial

16

that a particular defendant has had before this judge.

17

opens up any prior trial that involved the same kind of

issues.

The problem -- your response to the
The problem -- what you're

It

I mean, defense counsel could bring in other

20

trials involving protestors at Fort Benning, or other

21

trials involving personal injury plaintiffs, or whatever.

22

It really gives enormous scope to disqualification

23

motions, and in criminal cases, especially where there's

24

not much to lose, I worry about the amount of time that

25

judges are going to have to be spending in considering

It's not just that this particular defendant was

One response I could make is that the Government

going to cause,

14

the court's

QUESTION:

1

If you're representing a defendant

2

who has been before a stern judge before, a judge that you

3

think you might have a case for saying there was an

4

appearance of bias, wouldn't you be bound, as a defense

5

attorney, to make that recusal motion?
MR. THOMPSON:

6

I don't think so, Your Honor.

7

I've been a criminal defense lawyer for 25 years, and I've

8

never brought a recusal motion before, and I've been

9

before many stern judges.
A filing of a recusal motion in Federal court

10
11

would be, in most instances, I think -- because of some of

12

the dynamics that the Chief Justice has indicated would

13

not be a good idea, because for the very interests of the

14

client, particularly if there weren't very good grounds,

15

because then your client is going to be before that judge,

16

having had your recusal motion denied, for sentencing at a

17

later time.

18

some definite prophylactic things that are built into the

19

standard.

You'd lose the case.

So I think there are

The other answer to Justice Scalia's question

is, really, in the system right now, we have the same

their conduct in the courtroom, whether or not they have

2

adopted extrajudicial source requirement or not.

3

QUESTION:

Why shouldn't it be - haven't you

4

made a point that doesn't work in your favor?

Why

5

shouldn't the authority be at that level, rather than

6

asking trial judges to sit in judgment on themselves and

7

review old transcripts, the kind of authority that you're

8

talking about generally would occur on an appeal, where

9

there's a remand with instructions to have the case

10

retried before another judge?

11

contemporaneous, not 10 years later, and it's by a

12

reviewing authority rather than the judge in the first

13

instance herself.

14

MR. THOMPSON:

So I suppose

For two reasons, Your Honor.

15

Number 1, in many courts of appeal, what they are using is

16

a much stricter standard than this statute requires.

17

is a pervasive bias standard, and for the courts to

18

maintain their appearance of impartiality, this more

19

liberal standard should be applied, and number 2, because

20

this is exactly the scheme that Congress set up.

21

it up to do it on this standard, and it set it up to do it

22

under the appearance of impropriety and it set it up so

23

the sitting judge would do it in the first instance.

24
25

It set

If there aren't any other questions at this
time, I'd like to reserve.

QUESTION:

1

I have one question.

There's some

discussion in the briefs about the actual alleged

misconduct of the judge in this case.

is the most serious transgression that the trial judge

5

made here indicating a lack of impartiality?
MR. THOMPSON:

9

What, in your view,

You mean in the 1983 or the 1991

trial?
QUESTION:

Well, you take your pick.

The reason

I'm asking the question is, I think perhaps if we reached

10

the merits we would not be as offended by the trial

11

judge's conduct as you suggest in you briefs, and I just

12

want to be sure I've focused on what you think the most

13

egregious misconduct of the judge was.

14

MR. THOMPSON:

The only misconduct that, is

15

specifically alleged on this petition is the failure to

16

look at the whole transcript, so we're clear on that.

17

not accusing a judge of a particular factual matter, but

18

the factual matters as are set out in 1983, I have

19

summarized ten different events which I think, looked at

20

in the total context of that trial, would raise an

21

appearance of bias.

do you think is the worst?
MR. THOMPSON:

to give a closing argument, and Judge Elliott, who was the

2

finder of fact in that case because it was a bench trial,

3

so severely criticized Father Rosebaugh for giving a

4

statement when he hadn't testified at trial that Father

5

Rosebaugh was obviously intimidated and stopped and

6

abandoned his argument, and then --

7

QUESTION:

We might have done the same thing

8

here, if you had given a similar statement.

9

better than to do that.

You know

It seems to me that that was

10

necessary in order to focus the defendant's attention on

11

what was going to be determinative of guilt or innocence.

12

MR. THOMPSON:

13

QUESTION:

14

It'S --

It may be there's a polite and an

impolite way to do this, I suppose.

15

MR. THOMPSON:

And I knew that as soon as I gave

16

one out of the ten in '83, or one out of the ten in '91, I

17

could be met with that rejoinder.

18

perfectly appropriate in any of those given situations.

19

That's why I think if you look at the totality of the

20

conduct and the post-'91 trial conduct, it's apparent at

21

this point that there is a reasonable ground of bias.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6

MR. HUNGAR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

7

28 U.S.C. section 455(a) was intended to overturn the

8

fundamental principle of recusal law that a judge's

9

unfavorable attitudes towards a party are generally not

10

disqualifying unless they have an extrajudicial source.

11
12

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Hungar, you just said, generally.

That's not what the Eleventh Circuit said.
MR. HUNGAR:

Well, the Eleventh Circuit and

14

every other court of appeals to address the question,

15

Justice Ginsburg, has recognized a pervasive bias

16

exception to the extrajudicial source requirement.

17

Eleventh Circuit did that in the McWhorter case, which is

18

cited in our brief, and we cite a number of other

19

decisions for that proposition as well.

20

QUESTION:

The

You read the sentence in the opinion

21

we're reviewing,

"but matters arising out of the course of

22

judicial proceedings are not a proper basis for recusal,"

23

as implicitly to contain the qualification, "except in

24

extraordinary cases."

25

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, what the Eleventh Circuit did

there, Your Honor, is state the general rule.

It didn't

2

refer to the pervasive bias exception, which clearly

3

exists under Eleventh Circuit law and under the law of the

4

other circuits, because petitioners never claimed -- never

5

relied on that argument.
All petitioner -- the only issue presented to

6

7

the Eleventh Circuit was this extrajudicial source

8

requirement argument that the extrajudicial source

9

requirement does not exist with respect to claims made

10

under section 455(a).
The Eleventh Circuit implicitly rejected that

11
12

argument, and since there was no other argument being made

13

by petitioners with respect to the recusal motion, did not

14

address the pervasive bias issue, and of course, for the

15

same reason that issue is not before this Court.

16

The only question presented by petitioners is

17

whether the extrajudicial source requirement applies under

18

section 455(a), but we certainly believe, and the courts

19

of appeals have indicated, that there is a pervasive bias

20

exception to handle the egregious cases where a reasonable

21

person would believe, based on the judge's actions arising

22

solely out of judicial proceedings, that the judge is

23

pervasively biased against a party and therefore should

is yes, you do not read this as an ironclad rule without

2

any exception?
MR. HUNGAR:

3

Correct.

Correct.

The Eleventh

4

Circuit stated the general rule.

It didn't refer to the

5

exceptions, because the exception had not been raised in

6

this case, but the Eleventh Circuit has not applied the

7

extrajudicial source requirement as an ironclad rule, nor

8

has any other court that we're aware of, and we don't

9

believe that it is an ironclad rule.
What the extrajudicial source requirement

10
11

reflects is the common sense notion that as a general

12

matter it's not reasonable to infer disqualifying bias

13

from the fact that a judge has formed opinions about the

14

parties or the merits of the case based on what the judge

15

has learned in the course of presiding over a case.

16

QUESTION:

And, of course, we could construe

17

MR. HUNGAR:

That's correct, Justice Souter.

We

23

believe that the language of section 455(a), which refers

24

explicitly to a reasonableness requirement, a rule of

25

reason is certainly not inconsistent with the

extrajudicial source doctrine as it has developed over the

2

years, because that doctrine, as we indicate, has a

3

pervasive bias exception, but it is simply in keeping with

4

the normal perceptions of a reasonable, fully informed

5

observer, that as a general matter, when a judge makes

6

credibility findings or rules on the merits, or acts in

7

any number of ways that may be perceived as unfair by a

8

party, as long as the judge is doing that based on what

9

the judge views to be the facts and the law as set forth

10

in the case, that's not a proper basis for recusal.

11

QUESTION:

Well --

Supposing that a judge -- take in

this 1983 trial, Judge Elliott had made rulings that were

14

beyond challenge at all, and -- but commented when the

that ground and the case was sent back to the same judge.

4

The judge then stated on the record that the

5

defendant had betrayed the judge, had broken faith with

the judge, and that as a consequence the judge was going

to increase his sentence to punish him for doing this and

to make sure he didn't waste the Government's money with a

MR. HUNGAR:

It's not irrelevant, Justice

Kennedy, because in the vast majority of cases, what --

the way these cases are actually litigated is that parties

3

QUESTION:

But if you have to go through the

4

exercise of reviewing to see whether there's persuasive

5

bias, why don't we just say that this is insufficient as a

6

showing to disqualify, and the whole dichotomy between

7

judicial and extrajudicial just becomes irrelevant at that

8

point?

9

I mean, your brief is very candid, in which you

10

say that there this exception when you think it's

11

necessary, but I'm just wondering if the exception doesn't

12

really swallow the rationale for having the distinction to

13

begin with.

14

MR. HUNGAR:

The courts of appeals, Your Honor,

15

have had no difficulty separating the wheat from the chaff

16

in this area.

17

The vast majority of cases that come up in the

18

courts of appeals can be either dispensed with readily

19

simply by applying the extrajudicial source requirement

20

even if there's no allegation of pervasive bias at all, or

21

it's so clear from the facts that it doesn't rise to that

22

level that they need not conduct the kind of fact-

intensive scrutiny of the transcript and the rulings in

have the courts conduct in every case.

The requirement -- I. believe that

QUESTION:

Well, I think it's hard to read into

it a pervasiveness requirement.

I mean, the language just

MR. HUNGAR:

With respect, Justice O'Connor, I

12

think not, because, of course, the language

13

"reasonableness" necessarily implies some flexibility and

14

Congress obviously intended the courts to have some

15

flexibility in applying that statute.

16

What I think the extrajudicial source

17

requirement, as it has existed over the past 80 years,

18

reflects, is the common sense notion and determination by

19

this Court and the lower Federal courts that in general

20

it's not reasonable to question -- to infer disqualifying

bias based on the fact that a judge has developed points

22

this area, and one of those traditional rules that have

2

governed recusal for bias in this area, and one of those

3

traditional rules, of course, is the extrajudicial source

4

requirement which has existed in the Federal courts for as

5

long as there has been such a thing as recusal for bias.
Recusal for bias was not recognized at common

6

7

law, and it was not available in the Federal courts until

section 144.
QUESTION:

Is your position essentially that the

Ginsburg.

The doctrine has been the backdrop against

which the Federal courts have analyzed claims of recusal

for bias for as long as there has been such a thing as

encompassing provision that is aimed not merely at recusal

22

reference to the law of recusal for interest, and not with

1

to include a reference to personal bias in a statute that

2

wasn't aimed exclusively at bias, and indeed was aimed

3

primarily at interest and relationship, which has nothing

4

to do with personal bias.
Congress adopted a general standard in section

5
6

455(a).

7

reason Congress adopted that standard, what it hoped to

8

accomplish by doing so, was to change the law of recusal

9

for interest as it had developed under the previous

10
11

The legislative history makes clear that the

version of section 455.
Prior to 1974, section 455 addressed only

recusal for interest and relationship.

13

do with recusal for bias, and Congress when it amended the

14

statute in 1974 made clear that the purpose of that

15

amendment with respect to section 455(a) was to change two

16

aspects of the law of recusal for interest as it had

17

developed under section 455, namely this.

18

QUESTION:

It had nothing to

Well, if that's all it had wanted to

19

do, wouldn't it have been easier to amend 144, because 144

20

does have a textual basis for the gloss that was put on

it, because it refers to personal bias or prejudice, which

22

is a textual basis for the extrajudicial source rule?

never identified the word "personal" in section 144 as the

basis for the extrajudicial source doctrine.

3

I think, fairly read, this Court's decisions

simply reflect, as I said, the common sense notion that

it's generally not reasonable to question a judge's

impartiality if the judge is forming opinions based on

8

supposed to do.

That's what judges are

That's what they do every day, and that's

what a reasonable observer would expect them to do.
10

But if a judge is forming opinions about the

11

parties or the case based on something totally extraneous

12

to the case, something that the judge has read in the

newspaper or been told at the country club, then I think a

reasonable person would tend to question the judge's

impartiality.

This case is not about pervasive bias, both

3

think any fair reading of the claims they asserted in

4

their brief, without getting any further into the

transcript and the merits of the judge's ruling, plainly

6

indicates that the judge is not so biased against the

the point, section 455(a) and the language of that

statute, as we've indicated, is not inconsistent with the

extrajudicial source requirement, including the pervasive

bias exception.

Whether, as a matter of first impression, this

13

Court would have adopted precisely the same approach to

14

recusal for bias if faced with the language of section

455(a) and nothing else, is beside the point.

16

is that because the doctrine, which has existed from the

17

beginning of this entire area of the law, is not

18

inconsistent with the language of section 455(a), the

19

conclusion is inescapable that Congress did not indicate

any intention to eliminate that doctrine when it enacted

section 455(a).

The point

If Congress intends to change the interpretation of a

it's a pervasive bias, they say, it would not reasonably.
MR. THOMPSON:

4

But if it's only "might," Your

5

Honor, what it would -- what "might" means is an

6

appearance of bias, not a pervasive bias, so the standards

7

are totally different.

8

it requires an appearance of bias, and if you have

9

pervasive bias, it's beyond bias.

10

455(a) doesn't even require bias,

I mean, it's an

extremely egregious situation.
QUESTION:

11

Oh, I think what they're saying is,

13

odious torture and homicide case, one would expect you to
come out of it with a fairly -- assuming the person's

MR. THOMPSON:

QUESTION:

I agree.

That is not -- that is not

21

unreasonable, but it's only when it becomes unreasonable.

22

I mean, he flies into a towering rage, or something.

23

Then, at that point, it doesn't come within 455(a).

24

isn't that a perfectly valid interpretation of the

language?

■

That was on direct appeal?

It seems to me what common sense is is the

13

extrajudicial source requirement makes no sense, because

14

the way we know our judges is in the courtroom and by

15

their judging, not by their off-bench conduct, so what

16

makes common sense is to apply the statute the way it is

17

written.

18

Thirdly, he said in 1974 there has been no

19

change in the law, and therefore, since we want to drop

the extrajudicial source requirement under 455(a), we have

the burden.

It does, because it

The Eleventh Circuit, based on their

That's what's fundamentally unfair about the

in the judiciary is going to be diminished if someone

Wouldn't they have to read the
