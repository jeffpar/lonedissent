ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS C. WALSH

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

Court:
This case is a Commerce Clause challenge to

11
12

section 144.748 of the revised statutes of Missouri, which

13

imposes an additional use tax of 1-1/2 percent on all

14

goods purchased from out of State for use, storage, or

15

consumption in Missouri.

16

Now, the Missouri overall taxing scheme is thus

17

as follows.

18

is a 4.225 equivalent State-wide use tax.

19

statute adds an additional 1.5 percent use tax to be

20

charged across the State on all transactions from out of

21

State.

22

State-wide.

23

There is a 4.225 State-wide sales tax.

There

The challenged

There is no corresponding additional sales tax

Cities and counties and other municipalities

24

within the State, however, are authorized to enact local

25

sales taxes with the approval of the voters.

(800) FOR DEPO

There is no

1

authority for any such local use taxes.
Now, the result of this unusual statutory scheme

2

3

is a patchwork taxing scheme within the State of Missouri

4

that has 22 different local sales tax rates, ranging from

5

zero percent in several counties to 3.5 percent in one

6

city, and bear in mind that throughout the whole State,

7

the 1-1/2 percent additional use tax is applicable, so the

8

total use tax applicable throughout the State of Missouri

9

is 5.725 percent.
QUESTION:

10

Is there any correspondence, Mr.

11

Walsh, between the size of the local sales tax and the

12

population of the taxing jurisdiction?
MR. WALSH:

13

Not directly, Your Honor.

Some of

14

the higher sales tax rates are in the larger cities, and

15

some of those that have no additional sales tax are the

16

smaller rural communities, but there's no -- you can't

17

really draw a specific correlation.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Walsh, at one time was there a

19

provision that said if a local community imposes an

20

additional sales tax of its own, that it would impose an

21

equivalent use tax at the same time?
MR. WALSH:

22

There was a provision, Justice

23

O'Connor, in 1990, right before this particular law became

24

effective.

25

QUESTION:

Had that been adopted by the

MR. WALSH:

It was --

Did it ever go into effect?
Well, it was on the books for about

a year, but it was never implemented.
QUESTION:

7

Yes, it had.

Had that been implemented, would you

be here?
MR. WALSH:

8

Not at all, Your Honor.

I -- we

have no quarrel with that kind of -QUESTION:

10
11

Why was it not implemented?

Why was

this shift made?
MR. WALSH:

12

The record doesn't really show that,

13

Your Honor, except that a) the state thought it was

14

easier, apparently, to do it the way that it eventually

15

decided to do it, and b)

16

concern about whether local voters would actually adopt a

17

local use tax.

18

QUESTION:

I think there was probably some

Is that the method employed in some

1

other States that allow local imposition of additional

20

sales tax?

21

MR. WALSH:

The record shows, Your Honor, that

22

there are 28 States that allow local use taxes, and every

23

one of them has some sort of mechanism which prohibits the

24

local use tax from being greater than the local sales tax.

Missouri is the only State that has adopted this

MR. WALSH:

They would

QUESTION:

It's the latter that causes the

difficulty here.
MR. WALSH:

That's the statute that causes the

It's the

It's the combination of the use tax

exceeding the sales tax.
MR. WALSH:

Yes, it is, Your Honor, but the

11

excess 1.5 is in a separate statute, and it could be

12

invalidated without affecting the base.

13

QUESTION:

It is true, is it not, that the

14

scheme that you said you would not challenge in response

15

to Justice O'Connor, if all of the local jurisdictions in

16

fact added on a use tax, would have netted more money

17

rather than less.

interstate commerce, and yet the scheme that you say would

be constitutional could have netted the State more.

You had a line in your brief about

MR. WALSH:

Well, it could have, if the local

22

municipalities had adopted it.

23

this is that the State tried to preempt the local option

by imposing this use tax at the State level, and I think

it's just a matter of supposition whether the local

7

It can't be

It's -QUESTION:

Well, why not, Mr. Walsh?

Why

8

wouldn't it be an adequate remedy to simply say the

9

Constitution prohibits the enforcement of the statute in

10

those jurisdictions where it produces a higher total than

11

produces any discrimination?

12

13

MR. WALSH:

Well, I guess that would be some

sort of a geographical severance type article.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WALSH:

Yes, sure.
But the statute is a -- it imposes a

16

1-1/2 percent use tax in -- everywhere, to every

transaction.

I understand that, but there's

nothing wrong with the collection of it in Jackson County,

It would assume the Federal

Constitution just requires correction of Federal
constitutional violations.
MR. WALSH:

It doesn't require a windfall.

But you can't analyze the statute

that way, because every year, it changes.
QUESTION:
State law?

Every --

Why wouldn't that be a question of

I mean, if the -- your argument on Federal

constitutionality is you can't have a higher use tax than
sales tax.

If this Court just says that, then why isn't

the State free to say, our statute stands to the extent
that it doesn't violate that constitutional requirement?
MR. WALSH:

Well, I think that -- I think it's

primarily, first of all a question of Federal
constitutional law, because the -QUESTION:

Constitutional law where the use tax

higher than a sales tax is no good.
MR. WALSH:
QUESTION:

Right.
Once that proposition -- if that

proposition is decided in your favor, then why shouldn't
the rest -- what happens next, excepting that premise, be
for the State to determine?
MR. WALSH:

Well, I think the Court has to make

a determination, looking at this statutory scheme as a
whole, whether there is any basis, whether in State or

Federal law, for severing offending parts of this statute

2

and salvaging the rest.

3

QUESTION:

Yes, but you keep speaking of

4

offending parts of the statute.

The question of severance

is offending taxing jurisdictions, and how those

particular taxing jurisdictions reach the point of

7

offending seems to me is a question of State law.

It's

Why do we not, in order to rule your way, simply
10

declare the disparity is unconstitutional, leaving it to

11

State law to unscramble the eggs any way it wants to in

12

order to get the required result?

13

MR. WALSH:

Because I think that the issue of

14

facial discrimination here makes the entire scheme

15

unconstitutional.

16

QUESTION:

17

going to say the bottom line.

18

That's where the discrimination is.

1

becomes a Federal question to identify whether one element

of a complex State tax scheme is the particular culprit as

those elements produce.

QUESTION:

No.

It only offends the Commerce

3

Clause because it's being added on to two other layers of

4

tax, one of which is within the control of particular

5

counties and municipalities.

6

MR. WALSH:

But at the State level you have

4.225 sales tax, you have 5.725 use tax, and that is --

8

that is the scheme that is being delivered to the

9

counties, the municipalities, the cities, and --

10

QUESTION:

Are you telling us that in order for

11

you to win your case we have in fact got to, as it were,

12

tell the State how to unscramble the causes that bring

13

about this top line violation?

14

MR. WALSH:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WALSH:

Our position is that within -Well, yes or no.

Yes or no.

Yes, because -- because our position

17

is that within a single taxing jurisdiction, within any

18

State, if a use tax exceeds a sales tax, that violates the

19

Commerce Clause.

20

That inhibits interstate commerce.

QUESTION:

Yes, but you mention the word

question isn't for the State to decide.

QUESTION:

2

Suppose that every county were like

3

Kansas City and Jefferson County, and that there were no

4

disparities because the counties in every instance

5

adjusted their laws so that the sales and use tax were

6

equal.

7

Would there be a violation of the Constitution?
MR. WALSH:

That would be statistically

8

improbable, but the facial problem that exists with regard

9

to the overall statute would still exist.

10
11

12

There might not

be any discrimination in fact.
QUESTION:

Well, could you bring a suit in those

circumstances?

13

MR. WALSH:

I might not have any injury, but

14

I -- no, I probably couldn't.

15

QUESTION:

So if one county, or one

16

municipality, then deviates, then the entire statutory

17

scheme falls?

MR. WALSH:

No.

The problem is that there's no

Now, the theory -- the only theory that the

think this Court has ever upheld a system whereby one
sovereign can enact a tax, pass a tax that discriminates
against interstate commerce and rely on some other
sovereign -QUESTION:

But you're assuming that we're

deciding a question of State sovereignty.

Isn't it the

State's business to decide how it's going to, as it were,
allocate its governmental taxing power?

Don't we simply

look to the State as a whole and ask what the result is?
MR. WALSH:

The State may allocate taxing

responsibility, but it's our position that if the State is
going to create a compensatory use tax system, then either
it has to do so at the State level, or it has to do so -it has to delegate to the municipalities the right to do
so, and require that any use tax be no greater than any
sales tax.
QUESTION:

Well, what's your authority for that

proposition, Mr. Walsh?

Now, it would be something about

the structure of State Government.

It certainly has

nothing to do with interstate commerce.
MR. WALSH:

Well, it has to do with the

requirement of Halliburton, of Silas Marner, that -- Silas
Mason.

QUESTION:

2

MR. WALSH:

Good book.
-- that the use tax, because of its

3

inherently discriminatory and protectionist nature is

4

allowed, but only under very restricted circumstances, and

5

the law is that you must -- in building in a use tax you

6

must provide that local and out-of-State sellers are

7

treated equally, local and out-of-State goods are treated

8

equally, and, as the Court said in Boston Stock Exchange,
a use tax is only valid if a purchaser, looking at the

10

options between buying in-State and buying out-of-State

11

can make that decision without regard to the tax

12

consequences.

13
14

QUESTION:

Now, those are all Commerce Clause

principles.

15

MR. WALSH:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.
But you're urging here something that

17

I don't think has ever emerged in any of our commerce

18

cases or any other case, and that is that somehow the

1

State has to handle it all itself, and you don't look at

20

the net result between taxing authorities and the State,

21

but there's some principle that requires the State to do

22

certain parts of it and the counties to do a certain part

23

of it, and we have many cases saying that the State can

24

divide up its authority the way it wants to.

question in the case, Your Honor, is, is this a

2

compensatory tax, because a use tax, if it's not a

3

compensatory tax, is prima facie violative of the Commerce

4

Clause.

5

Its only purpose is to protect local industry

and, by definition -- by definition it discriminates

7

against interstate commerce, so where is the compensating

8

sales tax that this act is designed to protect local

9

merchants against, and at -QUESTION:

10
11

It's in St. Louis, certainly, and

it's in Jackson County.
MR. WALSH:

12

You've agreed to both of those.

But it's a lot of places -- there's

a lot of places where it isn't, and it isn't a tax that

Your Honor, certainly there's

ample precedent in this Court's cases -- the Bacchus case,

to my question is, that is okay?

2

MR. DOWNING:

If one county enacted a -- decided

3

to have no sales tax in order to benefit local businesses,

that would be okay, as long as the overall effect of State

5

regulation on the national economy was either neutral or

pro interstate commerce, like it is here.

QUESTION:

One county can impose a $100 fee on

people doing business in that county from out of State, so

rebate, in equivalent dollar amount?
MR. DOWNING:

I think that's a different

12

situation, Your Honor, because that's not a compensatory

tax case.

14

In the compensatory tax area, this case is

15

analyzed differently from -- for example, I think the

16

hypothetical you're talking about is somewhat similar to

17

the Fort Gratiot case the Court decided 2 years ago, where

18

a local county had an environmental regulation in which it

19

decided it was not going to accept out-of-State waste.

20

Well, all the other counties in the State

21

treated out-of-State waste evenhandedly.

They treated

22

them just like it was in-State waste, so the net effect of

Fort Gratiot, just like I think in the hypothetical you're

24

pointing out, the net effect was an overall burden to

interstate commerce.

Every county was treated equally.

One county was discriminating -- net, overall burden.

QUESTION:

Wait, before you get off that one,

4

what you're saying is, if the other counties had favored

out-of-State waste, that would be okay, So a State can

pass a law saying, the eastern half of our State, no out-

of-State waste is allowed.

out-of-State waste, so all out-of-State waste has to go

into the western half, and none of it can go into the

Well, in Maryland v. Louisiana, and Tyler Pike, the

the first step is to identify the burden.

Not the tax,

10

but the burden for which the State is attempting to

The State was attempting

Interstate sellers -- as this Court is well

aware from the Quill case, interstate sellers don't like

the varying local rate solution, because it is extremely

burdensome for them.

they sell into the State of Missouri, there are over 1,000

To determine for every transaction

They would have to determine for

So that's one reason, and it wasn't -- Missouri

11

didn't do this out of an altruistic sense to benefit

12

interstate sellers.

13

States realized that, to the extent a tax is easy to

14

comply with by a taxpayer, it's more efficient to collect.

15

I don't want to make that claim.

But

We get a greater -- we can collect a greater

16

percentage of our taxes by setting a State-wide rate,

17

because all interstate sellers now selling into Missouri

18

know exactly what their tax is on a use tax basis, so

19

that's one of the reasons.

20

Another reason is, the identical use and tax

system, and you had a resident of a local jurisdiction who

2

wanted to purchase a washing machine.

3

in a jurisdiction where the local use tax rates and sales

4

tax rates were high.

5

He happened to live

Well, he would have essentially three options.

6

He could purchase from a local vendor and pay a high local

7

sales tax rate, or he could purchase from an out-of-State

8

vendor and pay the equally high local use tax rate, or he

9

could travel to another local jurisdiction in Missouri and

10
11

pay a low sales tax rate.
Well, from the out-of-State seller's

12

perspective, that out-of-State seller is at the precise

13

competitive disadvantage in that situation as he is under

14

our present system, so Missouri recognized that going to

15

this identical rate in each jurisdiction solution doesn't

16

cure any supposed inequality that might exist.

17

So to accommodate the needs of interstate

18

sellers, and to make it more practical, admittedly, also

19

from the State's perspective, it's easier for the State to

20

administer on a State-wide basis, so those are the reasons

21

Missouri went to that system.

22

QUESTION:

the Court pointed out in Quill that very point, that even

a lot of trouble to figure out what the proper rate was.
MR. DOWNING:

2

Well, Your Honor, it's interesting

3

that you mention that, because currently pending before

4

Congress, Congress in response to this Court's decision in

5

Quill is actively considering this session a bill which

6

would enable -- and essentially adopt the Missouri system,

7

which would allow States to set, on a State-wide basis, a

8

State-wide use tax rate based on their local sales tax
rates.

10

And my point is not that this Court should

11

necessarily defer to Congress, but that in these difficult

12

practical issues of State taxation -- the Court in Quill

13

expressly recognized that Congress may well be better

14

equipped to address some of these issues than this Court,

15

and that was one of the reasons the Quill court chose not

16

to overrule the Bellas Hess case.

17

bright line rule that States could use in devising their

18

tax systems.

1

That case provided a

Well, that's the situation here.

The bright

20

line rule that General American and this Court's cases

21

have devised in this area is that if the tax that the

22

State imposes on in-State sales, if the average tax is

23

greater than or equal to the tax on interstate sales, then

24

there's no Commerce Clause concern.

was no facial discrimination.
MR. DOWNING:

2

Well, Your Honor, again that gets

3

to the issue, do you measure discrimination on a

transaction-by-transaction approach, or do you measure it

on an overall State-wide basis?

MR. DOWNING:

Jurisdiction by jurisdiction, I

Well, again, I would submit that

this Court has never invalidated a State tax, compensatory

10

tax, that on an overall basis is favorable to interstate

11

commerce like Missouri's is here.
QUESTION:

12

But have we ever distinguished

13

between -- have we ever, rather, ignored jurisdictions in

14

the way that you are asking us to ignore jurisdictions,

15

because what the State is doing, as you described to me a

16

moment ago, is becoming a collection agent for the various

17

sub-State jurisdictions, but the tax -- to the extent that

18

there is a differential, the tax is a tax of that sub-

State jurisdiction, and you are in effect saying, ignore

the actual taxing jurisdiction in this case.

there the interstate commerce and the interstate sellers

here.

for us to do that.

7

We've got a practical problem of State taxation.

I think Mr. Walsh concedes that.

Suppose a State just passes a general

5

law saying all out-of-State sales shall pay -- all out-

of-State sellers shall pay $500 a year to the State, all

7

right.

8

that by going case-by-case to find out whether in fact for

9

this particular seller the sales taxes that that seller

10

avoided offset the $500 and say only those who ended up

11

paying more than would have been taken out of their hides

12

in sales tax, only those have been treated

13

unconstitutionally?

14

Now, would we analyze the constitutionality of

We wouldn't do that, would we?

MR. DOWNING:

No, Your Honor.

Under this

Court's cases the compensatory tax has to reach

substantially equivalent events.

would have any events that the $500 flat rate fee were

taxing, so under the Court's precedents, no, that would

not be analyzed as a compensatory tax case.

So you say once you're taxing

there are differences at most, where there are differences

They're not concerned about any supposed undue

Well, could we have any possible area of unequal

treatment?
I dare say that the States that have adopted the

identical use and sales tax rates in each local

jurisdiction probably thought that they had solved the

constitutional problem of -- that if there was a

QUESTION:

1

How does it work in States that have

2

the county option?

Does the State also collect and remit

3

to the individual county, depending on what that county's

4

tax rate is?
MR. DOWNING:

5

Your Honor, I'm no certain of how

6

various other States perform the task of collection.

like it does in our system.

MR. DOWNING:

It's -- you're right, Your Honor,

12

we had the benefit of looking at what other States have

13

done, and also the input from the interstate firms that

14

were involved in the Quill case, so we were fully

15

cognizant of what other States had done when we devised

16

our system.

17

The second point I'd like to make from the Quill

18

case is, the Court recognized that the critical importance

19

of the doctrine of stare decisis in the area of State

20

taxation, for at least 67

21

approach has been firmly embedded in this Court's

22

precedents.

For the Court now to change that rule would

raise all sorts of new questions and undoubtedly engender

MR. WALSH:

9

Well, the principle is that a taxing

system that treats a use tax and a sales tax differently

11

is now and forever discriminatory and facially invalid,
