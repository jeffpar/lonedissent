ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOEL I. KLEIN

9

ON BEHALF OF FLORIDA, ET AL.
MR. KLEIN:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The district court incorrectly held that

12

13

Florida's legislative districting plan violates section 2

14

of the Voting Rights Act by diluting the votes of

15

Hispanics living in Dade County.

16

provides Dade County Hispanics with a proportional share

17

of majority districts, and we submit that such an

18

allocation necessarily gives them the same opportunity as

19

others to elect voters, to elect representatives of their

20

choice, which is all that section 2, by its terms,

21

requires.

The Florida plan

22

The United States agrees with us that

23

proportionality is sufficient, but it argues that we must

24

show proportionality with respect to all Hispanics in

25

Florida, not just those living in Dade County.

But the

1

problem with that argument is that it's flatly

2

inconsistent with this Court's decision in Gingles, which

3

held that any group claiming vote dilution must show that

4

it is sufficiently large and geographically compact to

5

constitute a majority in a single-member district.

6

In Florida, there's only one such group of

7

Hispanics who can meet that threshold requirement, and

8

those are the Hispanics living in Dade County, and they,

9

as I've said, already have proportional representation.

10

The remaining Hispanics in Florida are so geographically

11

diverse that it is impossible to construct anything

12

remotely resembling a compact district in which they could

13

be a majority.

14

Now, the United States' response is, well, you

15

can create more districts for Hispanics in Dade County.

16

But that simply misses the point of Gingles, which is, in

17

the absence of compactness, the State plan simply doesn't

18

dilute Hispanic votes, and therefore there's no violation

19

under section 2 and no remedial districts in any location

20

are required.

21

The United States' argument also has the other

22

problem of being incompatible with the text of section 2,

23

which protects a right to elect representatives, not a

24

right to have representatives elected by others of the

25

same race who may live hundreds of miles away in the

1

State.

A concept that the United States calls, quote,

2

virtual representation, but which is nowhere mentioned in

3

the statute, legislative history, or numerous decisions of

4

this Court addressing section 2.
So, if I can, let me state the principle that we

5
6

think governs the appeal, and that is that a State plan

7

satisfies section 2 if it provides a proportional share of

8

majority districts to each geographically compact group of

9

minorities, something that the Florida plan indisputably

10

does.

11

If I might, now, let me return --

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Klein, I assume that you are

13

asking us to reject this notion of the Statewide frame of

14

reference totally, for this case and for every case?

15

MR. KLEIN:

I think you have to reject it in the

16

following sense.

Unless you can show reasonable

17

geographic compactness throughout the State, which you

18

might be able to show in a case like Bandemer where there

19

were 59 percent Democrats or Republicans.

20

show that, I think you have to reject it and I think

21

Gingles requires it.

Unless you can

So I think that is my position.

22

And, indeed, I would suggest to the Court, if

23

one looks at the array of voting rights cases, from '65

24

forward, frankly, they are always brought locale by

25

locale.

They may be a multidistrict situation, but

they're not brought in a Statewide basis for precisely

2

this reason.
QUESTION:

3

Well, even -- I had thought perhaps a

4

Statewide basis was the proper focus.

5

trial of those complaining is limited to, as it was in

6

this case, Dade County, "I'm not sure that we need to go

7

beyond that now.
MR. KLEIN:

8

10

I agree with you, Justice O'Connor,

that the proof in this case was limited to Dade County.
And I think it's sufficient to dispose of this appeal.
QUESTION:

11
12

But if the proof at

And that's enough to dispose of the

case, is it not?

13

MR. KLEIN:

It is.

I do want to make the added

14

point -- it absolutely enough, but I do want to make the

15

added point that there would be no possible reason for a

16

remand.

17

that you cannot prove geographical compactness, a fact

18

that the United States concedes by suggesting that you

19

basically concentrate additional districts in Dade County.

Because it's not just a failure of proof, it's

20

But I think you're exactly right, Justice

21

O'Connor, and that's why I'd like to start with the

22

district court's opinion, which, after all, is the case

23

that brought us up here on appeal.

19

three, and we find that there's cohesion and white-bloc

21

in Dade County, and so we're going to impose 11 rather

22

than 9 districts.

Where its error is is in its

4

It happens every time.

Now, our submission would be section 2 obviously

6

is in thinking that you don't have to temper the Gingles

7

factors by a proportionality finding, something that the

8

Court in Gingles itself obviously did.

9

Where the district court went wrong

And the reason that is, is section 2 provides a

10

comparative standard.

11

the same opportunity as others.

12

out of 18 districts in Dade County that are majority

13

Hispanic, you are diminishing the opportunity of white

14

voters.

15

what you've done is you've created a far greater

16

opportunity for Hispanic voters than you would for white

17

voters, and that's not what the statute requires.

In other words, you have to have

That's exactly how you do this.

MR. KLEIN:

It's the touchstone as a maximum.

7

That is to say in order to -- I think this Court in

8

Gingles said the following, and I think this is exactly

9

right, that Gingles stands for the proposition that a

10

large, cohesive, compact -- large, cohesive, compact

11

majority does have a right to proportional representation.

12

That's what Gingles says is the equal opportunity.

Now, that means not mandated proportionality, as

the United States says.

that there is proportionality.

that the term protected minorities really does mean a

MR. KLEIN:

That is, it's not a group that is

protected with the term protected minority under the

statute.

That's my understanding of the legislative

this was designed to implement the Fifteenth Amendment and

therefore had a specific purpose.

3

possible, then, under the literal language of the

statute it does talk about members of a class of citizens

protected by subsection (a), and I think the general

6

reading of that has been that those are minority citizens

in the United States.

QUESTION:

But I guess it is

Is it your view that the cohesiveness

of the groups -- there was some issue about that in this

case, that that's irrelevant to your analysis.

11

question of -- is are we talking about a protected group,

12

are the Hispanics in Dade County and in other parts of the

13

State cohesive.

14

MR. KLEIN:

The

We concede that Hispanics in Dade

County are cohesive within Dade County.

dispute the proposition that Hispanics in Dade County are

17

cohesive with other Hispanics Statewide.

18

QUESTION:

We vigorously

But on your -- the view you stated

19

earlier about it's not a compact group, then the lack of

20

cohesiveness, the lack of identity, of necessary identity

21

of interest is kind of surplusage.

22

MR. KLEIN:

Is that --

That's correct.

That's correct.

23

That is, what our submission is is the failure of the

24

United States to prove cohesion Statewide under its terms,

25

means that it hasn't stated a Statewide claim.

It says in

1

order to show a Statewide claim, you'd have to prove

2

cohesion Statewide and white-bloc voting State-wide.

3

We say it never proved either of those things,

4

and a result of that it cannot prove up the very claim

5

that it is seeking to advance in this litigation.

6

However, even if it could prove up both of those points,

7

it would still fail because it failed to prove the first

8

Gingles factor of compactness on a Statewide basis.

9

Instead, what it did was basically to run

10

directly to something the statute disavows, and that is

11

proportional representation.

12

Hispanics live, their vote is diluted unless they get more

13

districts in Dade County because they're entitled to

14

Statewide proportionality.

15

inconsistent with Gingles.

QUESTION:

1

On this record, do you -- can you say

2

that Florida did have the obligation to structure

3

districts with proportional representation in Dade County

4

itself, or could they have had a luck-of-the-draw system?

5

MR. KLEIN:

Well, let me say it depends what one

6

means by luck-of-the-draw system.

I think what I would

7

say is the following, is that the Hispanics in Dade County

8

are reasonably compact, they are cohesive, and there's

9

white-bloc voting.

Therefore it seems to me, in drawing

10

district lines you have to take into account these

11

communities of interest.
QUESTION:

12

Are those premises an assumption that

13

the State has simply accepted in this case, or were they

14

proven?

15

MR. KLEIN:

They were proven, we believe, in

16

this case.

17

accurate.

18

those criteria are met.

And we think that they are not -- they are
That is they were -- we've never disputed that

19

Now, I think a very different question would be

20

done if a State, for example, took a computer and simply,

21

truly drew circles on a map as a way of drawing lines and

22

in no way took into account race.

23

Justice Kennedy, States do take into account community

24

interests, including both white and black and religious

25

and otherwise, and as long as you are reasonably compact,

But in practicality,

1

as Hispanics in Dade County are, we think that's what the

2

Voting Rights contemplates -- Act contemplates, and that's

3

reasonable.

4

So we are not unhappy with proportionality as a

5

solution here.

6

the United States decides to say that there are another

7

few hundred thousand Hispanics who are dispersed over

8

another 12 million people in Florida and we have to give

9

them proportional representation.

10
11

We think it's a fair one.

It's just when

That, we think, can't

be countenanced.
And we think, finally, in that regard -- let me

12

just make two last points.

13

of the pudding here is in the bizarre result the United

14

States is forced to embrace.

15

to 11 House and 4 Senate seats in Dade County, they have

16

to bring in voters all over -- actually people all over

17

the State of Florida into their case.

18

One, it seems to me the proof

Understand, in order to get

And then what do they say?

Not that those

19

voters get a chance to vote for anyone.

20

cannot vote in these minority districts, but people in

21

Dade County who already have a proportional group of

22

representatives, they're going to get extra people.

23

Those voters

And the United States says, well, that's because

24

all these people of the same race have a common interest.

The final point I would make --

I'm not sure -- but isn't that the

MR. KLEIN:

I think it is within a district.

QUESTION:

That is, the vote of no individual

that is not the premise of the current Voting Rights Act.

because one voter simply cannot elect people of his or her

choice.

3

necessary consequence of the Voting Act is that it is a

group right.

5

And so I think the necessarily consequence --

QUESTION:

Well you have -- it's a capacity to

form a group, isn't it?

7

to reconcile it with traditional -- the traditional

8

Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.

9

MR. KLEIN:

I mean isn't that perhaps the way

Well, I don't know that it has to be

10

reconciled in the following sense.

11

Congress -- obviously this Court in the Bolden case had

12

reconciled it with the Fourteenth Amendment, and Congress

13

went beyond that when it amended the statute.

14

seems to me at least the decision --

QUESTION:

I think that

Well, the further you get beyond it,

the riskier it is, though.

17

MR. KLEIN:

I agree with that, and that's what I

18

think the principle of the Shaw decision was last term.

19

That is, I think there is a point where Congress' ability

20

to fashion group rights may run into an equal protection

21

problem.

22

But I don't think any of that's presented here.
The last point, if I might, is even if we were

to assume the test of Statewide proportionality here,

24

there's absolutely no question that Florida's plan

provides Statewide proportionality to Hispanics on the

basis of citizenship.

That is to say that there are --

2

approximately 7.15 percent of the State are citizens, are

3

Hispanics.

4

the number of seats in the House and Senate exceeds 7.15

5

percent.

That's not just in Dade, but Statewide.

And

And there's no question here what the Voting

6

7

Rights Act covers.

8

the rights of people, not the rights of people of a

9

certain age, but the rights of citizens.
QUESTION:

10

It covers the rights of citizens, not

I think the Government argues -- or

11

perhaps it's the Appellee who argues in response to that

12

that Florida has chosen to draw its districts in terms of

13

total population rather than people of voting age,

14

citizens, and so it can't complain if the Voting Rights

15

Act case is fought out along those lines.
MR. KLEIN:

16

I don't -- I don't think that's a

17

correct -- I think that's what they argue, Mr. Chief

Justice.

19

I don't think they're right about that.
I think this Court has said for one person, one

20

vote allocations you can use population, and Florida did

21

that and I don't think there's any problem.

22

question in this case is do Hispanic citizens in

23

Florida -- because they're now making a Statewide claim,

24

they're no longer making a district claim -- do they have

less opportunity than other members of the electorate to

so under any view of the facts, we submit that this case

should render a finding of no liability with respect to

with respect to the Senate plan of no violation was

correct, and with respect to the House plan should be

group is under represented and other parts of the

2

jurisdiction where it's over represented.

3

The whole point of looking at this to determine

4

whether the minority group has an equal opportunity to

5

participate and elect, is to determine when you look at

6

those electoral opportunities divided up over the

7

jurisdiction as a whole, of whether it's equal.
QUESTION:

9

How do you square that with the

compact and cohesiveness requirement of Gingles?
MR. FELDMAN:

10

I actually don't think there's any

11

problem in squaring that with those requirements.

12

compactness requirement in Gingles, the Court was quite

13

explicit in stating why that requirement was necessary,

14

and that was to show that there is some area of the

15

jurisdiction where the minority group is sufficiently

16

compact that it could form a district if the State wanted

17

to do that.

QUESTION:

Does it mean, for example, to vote for one party rather

MR. FELDMAN:

I mean I think that might be a

factor.

But the way it's commonly proven is you look at

studies of how people -- of how groups vote.

found in Florida is that very consistently Hispanics want

to elect Hispanics as candidates, throughout the State,

MR. FELDMAN:

"This

This is volume 1 of the transcript, page 82.

on, I think, in this case was the question of whether you

That there was a lot -- most of -- I think it's

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Feldman, on page 40a of the

3

Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement where you get to

4

part B of the court's opinion, that first sentence is the

5

plaintiffs -- that the Dade County's -- "the Dade County's

6

Hispanic population is sufficiently large and

7

geographically compact to constitute a majority in 4

8

Senate and 11 House districts."
That sounds to me as if they were thinking in

terms of Dade County and not of the State at large.
MR. FELDMAN:

12

I think -- I think it may be

inartfully drawn.

QUESTION:

But it's very difficult to contend

14

otherwise, at least with respect to that particular

15

sentence.

16

MR. FELDMAN:

I think what they meant in that

17

sentence was that the vote dilution that had occurred -- I

18

mean, what you had was a practice where Hispanics could

19

only elect other Hispanics -- or could only elect

20

candidates of their choice where they were the majority --

21

where they were in the majority in a district.

22

the State had deliberately drawn lines to fragment

Hispanic populations in Miami --or the State had drawn

lines that had the effect of fragmenting Hispanics in the

And what the court was saying was that was where

Well, if you look at the -- the

20

The results of

Racially polarized voting, as this Court knows

Where do you extract from this

can only make -- perhaps answer that by repeating, I

2

think, what I said before, which is the question is

3

whether Hispanics in the State of Florida vote cohesively.

4

It has been shown in this case that there -- well, it has

5

been shown in this case that no Hispanic, for example, was

6

elected to- the Florida State Senate until 1988, never,

7

that no Hispanic was elected to Congress until 1989.

8

Hispanics -- there were findings that Hispanics do not win

9

elections in Florida unless they're in the majority of a

10
11

That

district.
Maybe that supplies the -- what's -- what you --

12

clarifies what these findings are.

13

findings point in the same direction, that where Hispanics

14

are in the majority in a district, they get the

15

opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice, and

16

where they're not, they don't.

17

But all of these

And I think that there were experts who

18

testified to support the independent expert's and special

19

master's findings, and so on.

20

I think they all mutually support each other, which is

21

that in the State -- in the State, as a whole, Hispanics

22

vote cohesively.

Hispanic population outside of Dade County cannot

3

legitimately be taken into consideration for purposes of

MR. FELDMAN:

5

Yes, I do.

And I think if there's

6

some doubt about what -- if you look at the Joint Appendix

7

at 61, at 103, there's expert testimony, 81, 209, 38, 266,

8

if you look at all those and you still don't think that

it's made out on a Statewide basis, I think the

appropriate thing to do would be to remand the case and

let the district court make the finding that you would

Is it enough if -- I mean are we

supposed to go through the testimony to see if it was made

Doesn't Gingles require that there be a finding?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, the only reason I refer --

17

this is -- the only reason I refer to the testimony is

because there are, in addition to the opinion that was --

court, the district court didn't specify, for instance,

3

whether Hispanics in the State of Florida, as a whole, are

or are not cohesive, then that's a finding that simply has

to be made one way or the other.

6

They -- certainly the district court never said

7

that Hispanics were not cohesive in the State of Florida.

8

If the court had said that, then I think it would be --

9

the appropriate thing to do probably would be to reverse.

10

There might still be additional issues remaining in the

11

case on other points.

QUESTION:

So you're saying there was -- at

worse, from your point of view, there was a failure of the

district court to find on a crucial issue.

question -- you have to look Statewide to determine -- the

appropriate measure for whether a State's districting plan

MR. FELDMAN:

Actually, yes, I think there is.

2

I think Davis against Bandemer looked at the whole State

3

when it was looking at a very similar type of claim.

4

also think that the four Justices in Shaw against Reno who

5

dissented, who analyzed the case quite different from the

didn't suggest that vote dilution claims of the sort that

Taking a State -- taking a State-wide

possible number of seats in, say, the State legislature.

MR. FELDMAN:

I think a State can reasonably

10

act, for instance, to preclude a section 2 claim.

And if

11

that requires drawing as many districts in an area, or in

the State or wherever it is, in which the minority group

QUESTION:

Doesn't that mean it's all the more

MR. FELDMAN:

think the record supported those findings.

mischaracterizing what's happening.

Actually, Fort Lauderdale

Barely, by the fact that you're

dropping one number from the numerator and one from the

But the point is that their analysis -- if

10

you focus down on any one single district -- if you focus

11

on District 114, for example, which is this one to the

12

left of the pink district here in Dade County, and if you

13

focus on that and you say let's just look at that

14

district, then Hispanics are 84 percent of the population

15

there and they have 100 percent of the seats, so they're

16

underrepresented.

17

And then, as a matter of logic, as the circle

proportional representation.

voters in a single district, Justice Stevens, would make

if you assumed 20 percent blacks in that group and you
