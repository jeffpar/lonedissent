ORAL ARGUMENT OF TUCKER K. TRAUTMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TRAUTMAN:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The two central issues that you are faced with

11
12

today are whether Congress intended to create a private

13

cause of action for aiding and abetting under 10(b), and

14

secondly, if you so conclude, whether or not recklessness

15

can provide a sufficient level of scienter, even though

16

there is no duty breached either to disclose, or a duty of

17

action.
Resolutions of these issues is shaped by the

18
19

unique features of this case.

Specifically, Central Bank

20

was not sued as a primary violator who allegedly engaged

21

in deceptive or manipulative practices.

22

Bank was accused of substantially assisting the primary

23

violation of others by agreeing to delay a new appraisal

24

until after bonds were issued, thereby allowing the fraud

25

to occur.

Instead, Central

1

Central Bank was not involved in selling the

2

bonds or marketing the bonds, but instead acted as

3

indenture trustee, who had specific duties under a

4

contractual document known as an indenture setting out the

5

duties and setting out the bounds of its discretion.

6

This case was decided originally by the district

7

court on a motion for summary judgment after full

8

discovery, and at that time it was undisputed that the
alleged substantial assistance by Central Bank involved no

10

misrepresentation, involved no violation of duty of action

11

or duty to disclose under the indenture, and in fact was a

12

discretionary act under the indenture.

13

Resolution of the first issue --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. TRAUTMAN:

What was that act?
The act that they claim Central

16

Bank engaged in, Your Honor, was to delay, if you will, an

17

appraisal until after the bonds were issued.

18

The resolution of the first issue on private

1

right of action in our view turns on the very nature of

20

what aiding and abetting is.

21

QUESTION:

May I just ask one other question --

22

MR. TRAUTMAN:

23

QUESTION:

Sure.

-- the delay.

It was discretionary.

24

Did they have the authority under their agreement, under

25

the indenture, to insist that the appraisal not be

determine the timing of that appraisal.
QUESTION:

6

They could either require a new

7

entirely discretionary, no standards about whether they

8

had any duty to - MR. TRAUTMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

That's correct, Your Honor.

Why, under the agreement, did they

have anything to say about the appraisal?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

12

Well, an indenture trustee

13

essentially has ministerial acts, carries out ministerial

14

acts.

15

as a stakeholder, essentially owing duties both to the

16

issuer of the bonds and the bondholder, and in this

17

particular case, the indenture set forth what the duties

18

were and what the bounds of discretion were.

Some courts have characterized this kind of trustee

QUESTION:

19

But would the decision of whether to

20

delay or not delay the appraisal be a ministerial act, in

21

your view?

22

MR. TRAUTMAN:

It would be - - I don't know what

23

label you would put on it, but it would be an act that the

24

trustee could decide in its sound discretion, and the

25

whole purpose of doing that - 5

QUESTION:

It seems to me there's some tension

2

between the notion that it's a discretionary matter and

3

it's a ministerial matter.

4

would be correct, but it's hard for me to see how both

5

could be correct.

6

9

MR. TRAUTMAN:

It seems to me one of those

Well, Your Honor, I think it

would be a discretionary matter.
QUESTION:

So the duties of the indenture

trustee are not entirely ministerial.

10

MR. TRAUTMAN:

That's correct.

That's correct.

11

Now, let me focus for a moment on what aiding

12

and abetting is, because I think that is the crux of the

13

problem with the private right of action.

14

abetting, in all circuits but the Seventh Circuit, does

15

not require a plaintiff to show a manipulative or

16

deceptive practice.

17

show is a violation, a primary violation by somebody else,

18

and substantial assistance of that violation by some act

19

or inaction, and finally, a level of scienter.

Is there a requirement that it be

done in concert with the principal actor?

QUESTION:

1

-- could the substantial assistance

2

required by the other circuits be rendered unconscious of

3

the fact that it is substantial assistance?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

4

It appears that that is the case,

5

and I think that's exactly what has happened in this

6

particular case, is that you have a situation where a

7

professional, a bank in this particular case, was acting

8

pursuant to its duties, and pursuant to its discretion,

9

and is accused here in taking an act which essentially

10

allowed a fraud to occur.
QUESTION:

11

Now, if I may --

Mr. Trautman, it seems to me that it

12

really is a quite separate offense from the fraud itself,

13

however.

14

aiding and abetting an offense even though the person who

15

has been accused of committing the offense itself is

16

acquitted?

That's correct.

Well, it seems to me to separate it

from the -- you know, the kind of inevitable

1

found in the past in Musick, for example.
MR. TRAUTMAN:

2

We agree, Your Honor, because the

3

aiding and abetting act, if you will, is not necessarily

4

deceptive or manipulative.
QUESTION:

5

Although as I understand it you

6

didn't question that in the district court, and the

7

district court ruled simply on the state of mind question,

8

is that not so?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

9

We did not raise the issue of

10

whether there was a private right of action because it

11

would have been fruitless, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

12

It would have been fruitless because

13

the law was so solidly against you in the lower courts, is

14

that - -

15

MR. TRAUTMAN:

The Tenth Circuit had found in

16

1974, without any analysis whatsoever -- they had assumed

17

that there was a private right of action, and we think

18

that those cases, Your Honor, essentially are premised

19

upon a methodology that this Court has now abandoned.

20

That is, the methodology from Borak, the methodology that

21

would allow courts to essentially import tort principles

22

into the -- into the act without an analysis as to whether

23

Congress really intended for that to happen.

24
25

QUESTION:

But you're arguing here that there

shouldn't be any aiding and abetting liability, period.

1

You're not arguing that there shouldn't be any aiding and

2

abetting only in the case of the innocent aider and

3

abettor.

4

MR. TRAUTMAN:

That's correct.

5

QUESTION:

Okay.

6

QUESTION:

And your argument would cover the SEC

7

as well, as it's not limited to - - you're talking about a

8

private right of action here, but if there is no aiding

9

and abetting liability, then the SEC could not go after it

10
11

either, is that correct?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

That is not correct, Your Honor.

12

This Court could decide the issue on a broad basis, which

13

would be to say that the words of 10(b) do not reach

14

aiding and abetting, and that would have the effect of

15

covering both private actions and SEC actions.

16

On the other hand, the Court could find, using

17

its approach announced in Musick, which essentially

18

followed the approach that had been followed for years,

19

could say that either it was a separate cause of action,

20

and we all know that Congress did not intend to create a

21

cause of action for 10(b) and therefore they did not

22

intend to create a cause of action for aiding and

23

abetting, or even if you don't find it's a separate cause

24

of action and you adopt the Government's view that this is

25

merely rounding out of an existing cause of action, you

1

look to, under the Musick case, section 9 and section 18,

2

those sections which were intended to be a measure, if you

3

will, of how Congress would have dealt with the issue, and

4

you find that they are silent as to aiding and abetting,

5

and we think that that is significant in this case because

6

of the fact that prior to 1934, as early as - -

7

QUESTION:

Silent as to the Commission as well

8

as the individual.

I'm -- what I'm trying to understand

9

is if you are acknowledging, or you're saying I don't have

10

to answer that question, that the SEC could similarly --

11

if you're correct, it's not aiding and abetting.

12

MR. TRAUTMAN:

No.

What I'm saying, Your Honor,

13

is that there are two roads that the Court could take,

14

both of which would result in my client winning the case,

15

and so from that point of view I don't particularly mind

16

which course you take.

17

If you take the broad course, I think that that

18

would have the effect, and that broad course would say

19

that the 10(b) was just never intended to cover any aiding

20

and abetting.

21

You could also take the narrow course, which

22

would be to merely say that this is a separate cause of

23

action, private cause of action, and therefore Congress

24

did not intend to create that private cause of action and

25

not get to the question of the language of 10(b), so I

think that there is a way for you to avoid the damage.

I might also --

QUESTION:

4

That is to say, it is not the private

cause of action that we have heretofore recognized.

5

MR. TRAUTMAN:

QUESTION:

And we're not going to recognize any

other private causes of action under 10(b).
MR. TRAUTMAN:

9

That'S correct.

That is correct.

That is

correct.
QUESTION:

Under the allegations of the

11

complaint taken in the light most favorably to the

12

plaintiff, could there have been a cause of action or an

13

allegation for liability as co -- of the bank as co­

14

conspirator?

15

MR. TRAUTMAN:

16

been any allegation at the onset.

17

here, Your Honor, was to not sue us as a primary violator,

18

but instead to sue us as an aider and abettor.

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose there could have
What they chose to do

Well, suppose they alleged that there

20

was an agreement to hold up the appraisal, and then

MR. TRAUTMAN:

In our view, a conspiracy would

also be a separate cause of action.

2

writings, in the general law of torts?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

In the general law of torts,

3

conspiracy has been considered as part of the underlying

4

tort, but here, and the problem we have with aiding and

5

abetting, I think it's the same problem you have with

6

conspiracy, is what the courts have tended to do is just

7

to assume that these peripheral rights are there without

8

any analysis as to whether Congress really intended them
to be there, and if, in fact, the key is --

10

QUESTION:

We all agreed that Congress didn't

11

provide any indicia of intent.

12

doing what we all concede wouldn't work.

13

MR. TRAUTMAN:

14

QUESTION:

You can't blame them for

That's correct.

The question, as Justice Scalia

15

raised, is whether it really falls within sort of the

16

rounding-out jurisprudence, and I mean, Justice Kennedy's

17

point is that they could have been pursued on a conspiracy

18

theory, and at least on traditional tort principles that

1

would not have been regarded as a departure, and if that's

20

so, why should this be regarded as a departure?

21

MR. TRAUTMAN:

Well, I think the difference --

22

there is a difference between aiding and abetting and

23

conspiracy, and let me just focus on that for a moment.

24

As you know, conspiracy is based upon an agreement,

25

essentially that there has been a relationship set up
12

(202)28 -2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

2

based on an agreement.
What aiding and abetting is really premised on

3

is additional conduct, additional conduct that the courts

4

have struggled to define and have used words of

5

substantial assistance and put all sorts of factors in

6

front of that, such as, was the defendant benefited, and

7

that sort of thing, and it has become a morass, as you

8

look at the cases, as to what substantial assistance

9

means, but that is separate conduct.

10

It is not a relationship, such as a conspiracy.

11

It is not, as this Court said in Musick, an allegation of

12

existing 10(b) liability, because it is additional conduct

13

beyond manipulation or deception.

14

QUESTION:

If the fact --

Well, in a sense -- in a sense,

15

conspiracy requires an element that aiding and abetting

16

doesn't, namely, an agreement, so in a sense, an aider and

17

abettor is acting closer to the principal actor than is a

18

conspirator.

19

MR. TRAUTMAN:

That's correct, but there is a

20

difference in terms of the actual -- you see, my problem

21

with what the lower courts have done is that they have

22

focused on this substantial assistance issue, and they've

23

lost their eye on the ball, and the ball really here is,

24

did my client engage in deceptive or manipulative conduct,

25

and if they did, they could be sued as a primary violator.

1

It so happens that the facts of this case, I think it's

2

clear or undisputed, that we did not do anything that this

3

Court has defined previously as being deceptive or

4

manipulative, and so what you have out there essentially

5

that's been applied -- implied by the courts is a cause of

6

action which allows a plaintiff to come in and sue a

7

defendant because the defendant was around the

8

transaction, was there, has deep pockets, and essentially
to make allegations that they have benefited from the

10

transaction, that they caused -- they helped cause the

11

transaction, if they had just acted differently, this

12

fraud wouldn't have occurred, but they did not engage in

13

any deceptive or manipulative conduct.

14

QUESTION:

But do you --

15

QUESTION:

But why is that so clear?

Why

16

couldn't one say that deliberately delaying the time that

17

this property would be reappraised was a manipulative

18

practice?

1

MR. TRAUTMAN:

Well, the reason why you can't

20

say that, Your Honor, is because manipulative practice has

21

really focused on two concepts.

22

and second is either a failure to act or failure to

23

disclose in a context where you have a duty to do so.

24

Neither of those two things are presented by this case.

that there could be - - conspirators could be held liable,

but if you look at that case, that those so-called

"coconspirators" were really primarily liable in our view,

6

Mr. Trautman, in your response to me,

7

were you suggesting that there must be a duty to disclose,

8

otherwise you can't have liability as a principle, and if

9

so, what case held that?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

10

No, I'm not saying that there has

11

to be just a duty to disclose.

12

has to be misrepresentation or a duty to disclose, neither

13

of which were present here, and with respect to the duty

14

to disclosure, I think this Court's cases in Chiarella and

others.

I'm saying there either

If I could focus for a moment on the -- what I

18

think is the unavoidable legislative determination here is

19

that prior to 1934 in the context of the criminal law, the

20

Court essentially knew how to create criminal aiding and

21

abetting liability.

22

After 1934, in a whole series of amendments, in 1964,

23

'86, and 1990, they also knew how to create liability for

24

SEC disciplinary action.

MR. TRAUTMAN:

QUESTION:

MR. TRAUTMAN:

5

This is the Congress.

The Congress.
I apologize.

There are a lot of

them.

6

The -- and by contrast here, in 1934, in the act

7

itself, in section 10(b) there is no mention of aiding and

8

abetting, and we believe that that is very strong evidence

9

that both before and after 1934, they used very specific

10

language when they wished to create such a right, that in

11

the act in 1934 it is silent, and also, if you use the

12

measure, if you will, of -QUESTION:

13

You are now making the broader

14

argument in - - under Justice Ginsburg's question, so if we

15

agree with you on this argument, even the SEC could not

16

enforce aiding and abetting liability.
MR. TRAUTMAN:

17

Well, Your Honor, I think there

18

maybe three levels to go with this.

I said there were

19

two.

20

cause of action, and at that point in time, you can then

21

very quickly conclude that Congress intended no such cause

22

of action.

The first level is to find that there is a separate

23

The second level is to say that it is rounding

24

out, but the first thing we're going to do is to look at

25

whether there is a private cause of action, using section

1

9 and 18 as models, and if you do that, you can come to

2

the conclusion that there's no private right of action.

3

You don't have to get into the broader issue even in that

4

second realm of looking at whether or not it exceeds, if

5

you will - - whether the conduct exceeds what is permitted

6

by section 10(b).

7

The third is the broader one, and that would be

8

to say that we look at the language, we knew what we said

9

in Ernst and Ernst, and that is manipulation and deception

10

means manipulation and deception, it doesn't mean

11

something else such as substantial assistance of

12

manipulation and deception.

13

Your Honor, and I think that one would take care of the

14

SEC.

15

That is the broader ruling,

However, let me just mention, there is some

16

implication here that the SEC is going to be left

17

powerless if in fact you take that broad ruling, and I

18

think that that is incorrect.

19

given the SEC aiding and abetting authority in section 15

20

with regard to these disciplinary proceedings.

21

Yes, Congress after all has

And also in 1990, in a recent amendment, they --

22

they held that the SEC -- this is the Congress again, Mr.

23

Chief Justice -- held that the SEC had cease and desist

24

authority against any person who is violating, has

25

violated, or is about to violate any provision of the

statute, or any other person that is, was, or would be a

2

cause of the violation due to an act or omission such

3

other person knew or should have known would contribute to

4

such violation.
The point being, it seems to me, that the SEC

5
6

still does have enforcement authority both in section 15

7

as well as this section, which is 21(c), added in 1990.
The second point that I think that this brings

8

9

out is that Congress knew again how to create liability

10

beyond just the direct liability that is set forth in the

11

statute.

12

SEC disciplinary proceedings, and they used contribution

13

language in this particular case.

14

They used aiding and abetting language in the

Let me just spend a moment, if I may, on the

15

second issue which hopefully you will not have to reach,

16

and that is the issue of what is the proper scienter

17

standard if, in fact, there is such an aiding and abetting

18

right.

19

QUESTION:

May I ask you, counsel, if you would

20

concede that recklessness is a sufficient mens rea to

21

satisfy any scienter requirement for primary liability?

22

MR. TRAUTMAN:

Well, Your Honor, we think that

23

that question obviously is not raised here, does not have

24

to be decided, but if in fact --

question?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

2

If in fact -- if in fact that

3

question were presented, we think that the proper approach

4

would he to look at the words of 10(b) and to say that you

5

cannot have a reckless manipulation, you cannot have a

6

reckless device, so I don't think it should.

7

there may be cases that come before this Court where the

8

Court would - QUESTION:

I

21

think the point being that if you decide, however, that

22

recklessness were sufficient for aiding and abetting, I

23

think almost by necessity everybody will assume that it's

24

good enough for a primary violation even though you may

25

try to reserve the question.

By contrast, there is a principal basis --

2

QUESTION:

3

We might approach it just the other

way and say clearly its enough under primary --

4

MR. TRAUTMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

Exactly.

-- liability and why shouldn't it be

enough if there's aiding and abetting?
MR. TRAUTMAN:

Okay, and the reason why there

8

shouldn't be enough if it's aiding and abetting would be

9

to recognize that -- if you find that there is a separate

10

cause of action for aiding and abetting, or that there is

11

an additional cause of action implied by Congress for

12

aiding and abetting, the principal difference being that

13

that is one step removed from a primary violation and yet

14

carries with it joint and several liability, and so there

15

is a logical basis for saying that in that circumstance

16

we're going to require a higher degree of knowledge or

17

scienter than we are in the primary violation.

18

Also, the other basis would be to recognize, ask

19

as this Court did in the criminal law context in Nye and

20

Nissen that aiding and abetting, as Justice Learned --

21

Judge Learned Hand at that point in time said,

22

sort you must associate yourself with a venture that he

23

participated as is something he wishes to bring about,

24

that he seek by his action to make it succeed, and it

2

purposeful, conscious conduct to further what was going

on. "

4

The most difficult problem that you have with

5

recklessness, in my view, I think is pointed out by the

6

SEC's brief, where in the same breath they say that the

7

standard is both a flexible and predictable standard, and

8

I think we would agree with the first part that it is

9

flexible.

It is so flexible, however, that the only

10

prediction that we can give our clients is that every case

11

will be decided on its facts.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. TRAUTMAN:

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. TRAUTMAN:

It's predictably flexible.
Exactly.

The difficulty created for

16

professionals in complex litigation such as this one,

17

complex securities transactions where you have

18

underwriters, appraisers, accountants, bond and disclosure

19

counsel and trustee, all of whom have specific duties and

20

expertise, and to a large extent all of whom rely on the

21

others to carry out their particular roles, those

22

differences, however, are overridden by a common trait in

23

these transactions.

24
25

They all assist.

By definition, they all assist, and therefore
they are potential targets for aiding and abetting if

their actions or inactions allowed the fraud to occur, and

2

as this -- I think it's the Tenth Circuit opinion

3

indicates, oftentimes the difference between action and

4

inaction is found in the eye of the beholder.

5

Did Central Bank take affirmative action by

6

delaying the appraisal until after the bonds were issued,

7

or by contrast, did Central Bank fail to have a new

8

appraisal done before the bonds were issued, and we think
that a determination of liability on such

10

characterizations would not be appropriate.

ingredient. They took another $2 million in collateral in

15

MR. TRAUTMAN:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

In this case you've got another

17

factual ingredient, because the bank took another

$2 million of collateral in order to be quiet about it

22

MR. TRAUTMAN:

No, the $2 million of collateral,

Your Honor, related to an earlier bond issue.

MR. TRAUTMAN:

Let me just focus my last

comments before sitting down on what I think the

10

fundamental problem with recklessness is, and that is, it

11

is too much like negligence, which this Court has already

12

found in Ernst & Ernst is not a sufficient level of

13

scienter for 10(b).

14

Both negligence and recklessness involve a

15

deviation from a standard of care.

16

they're identical.

17

however, is that recklessness requires an extreme

18

departure from that standard of care, and in our view

19

that's a very slippery standard which will prevent summary

20

judgment from being granted for wrongfully accused

21

defendants, and it will allow liability based upon a

22

jury's view of the extremity of the defendant's conduct.

23

To that extent,

The only difference between the two,

It will also allow judges and juries to, in

24

essence, create a Federal standard of conduct after the

They didn't say, extreme lack of care, or

MR. TRAUTMAN:

It defined it -- it essentially

used the Sundstrand approach, which was that it had to be

8

an extreme departure from a standard of care.

9

the definition that they used, Your Honor.

That was

And so what we're left with is scienter being

10
11

the only reliable screen that this Court has to sort out

12

conduct that is truly the use of a manipulative or

13

deceptive device or contrivance from other conduct

14

believed by plaintiffs to be unfair, and as we indicate,

15

we believe that in the case of aiding and abetting,

16

because it is one step removed from primary liability,

that the better approach is to use conscious intent.

remedy which has been developed over 30 years by the lower

3

Federal courts in hundreds of cases and which has been

4

approved and applied by every one of the Federal appellate

5

courts is a fully actionable part of the 10b-5 cause.
This Court said 6 months ago in Musick, Peeler

6

7

that we must confront the law in its current form, and the

8

current form of the law is that there is a section 10(b)

9

private action, that it reaches primary violators, and

10

after Musick, Peeler it reaches at least one form of joint

11

tortfeasors -- that is, contributors -- and this case

raises the question or the issue about a different form of

13

joint tortfeasor, that is, aiders and abettors.

I - - in the Musick, Peeler case, though, the

Justice Kennedy, you asked about conspiracy,

that is relevant here today, whether that's a separate

action that the Court had recognized, that it necessarily-

2

followed that there should be a right against

3

conspirators, and in a similar context in the case cited

4

by the SEC in their brief, American Society of Mechanical

5

Engineers v. Hydrolevel, there you had an express private

6

action under the Sherman Act, and the question there was

7

whether there should be a right against an employer on an

8

agency theory, and similarly there, the courts said,

9

looking at the common law and saying that the agency

10

theory was well-established in the common law, that to be

11

faithful to the purpose of the Congress in the express

12

private action, that the case should reach beyond primary

13

violators to an agency theory.

14

All of these, we would say, these cases that

15

I've just been discussing -- Musick, Peeler in respect to

16

contribution, ASME in respect to employer liability, the

17

Curran case in respect to conspiracy, and here in this

18

case, aiding and abetting -- what they do, although these

19

are different forms of joint tortfeasor liability, they

20

are all questions which arise in different contexts under

21

existing private actions, and this is a question of aiding

22

and abetting liability, another form -- different, but

another form of joint tortfeasor liability under an

24

existing cause of action, the section 10(b) action.

QUESTION:

Well, that's a different question.

I

2

mean, rounding out is quite different from asking

3

yourself, would the Congress that created a private right

4

of action under 10(b) of the sort we've already recognized

5

also create a private cause of action for'this?

6

answer to the latter question is, God, a Congress that

7

would do it for that would do it for all sorts of

8

violations of the Security Act, and that's quite different

9

from rounding out.

The

Rounding out is to say, we've already

10

held that Congress has created this, but whether they

11

really did or not doesn't matter.

12

is such an inherent part of that that we can't possibly

13

withhold acknowledgement of that as well.

14

We've held that.

This

You're inviting us to adopt a quite different

15

test, to say, would the Congress that created the private

16

right of action we've already acknowledged create another

17

private right of action?

18

create right of actions all over the place if they

19

accepted the one we've already found.

20

MR. GERSH:

Well -- well, I think they'd

Justice Scalia, I would say that the

21

rounding out test is related in this sense, that there is

22

no rounding out doctrine in any of the Court's rounding

23

out cases -- Lampf, Musick, Peeler -- that is separate

24

from the question of how Congress would have originally

25

designed the cause of action.

The courts, even where there was an express

cause of action -- actually, the Curran case is another

good example of this -- are not at large simply to round

out a cause, or that cause of action when another issue

comes to them.

faithful to the scope of the express cause of action, and

in that sense the question, the rounding out question, is

the same one.

They have to do it in a way that is

it appropriate to round out unless Congress would have

created the liability on the premise of what we've done so

far, but it doesn't follow that everything that Congress

would have done would amount to rounding out for existing

kinds of action, isn't that true?

No, I think that that's -- I think

that that's true.

21

We would say that in - - that the answer to the

22

question whether aiding and abetting would be within the

23

purpose, within the intent, or scope, or contour of the

24

10b-5 private action, is answerable by looking at the same

25

sources of intent, congressional purpose, that the Court

2

First, at the background of -- the common law

3

background of the section 10(b) action, and there, with

4

respect to aiding and abetting, the answer we would submit

is a clear one, that aiding and abetting had a place in

the common law when the 1934 Congress came to its job in

therefore, the point of that is simply that, as this Court

17

has said, it was one of the undoubted purposes of

18

Congress, when it came to its task in 1934, to correct

19

perceived deficiencies of the common law.

20

We have cited cases going back to the

And therefore had this - - had the Congress

21

considered aiding and abetting in 1934, it would not have

22

left it out of a private action had it -- if it had done

that, it would have taken a step backward in the opposite

direction from bolstering the protections for investors,

The recklessness issue has to be analyzed, first of all,

of Congress in the 10b-5 action itself, and if you start

with the common law, recklessness also, as a matter of

QUESTION:

Well, when you're talking about

aiding and abetting someone else who might deceive or

the aider and abettor at least appreciate that there may

be someone in a position to manipulate or to deceive who

14

would be helped by the aider and abettor's conduct.

15

The aider and abettor may not have to make an

agreement with this primary defendant, and perhaps the

17

aider and abettor wouldn't have to know that this primary

18

defendant was about to manipulate or deceive, but the

19

aider and abettor would have to know that someone was in a

position to do that.

And isn't that perhaps the answer to the problem

that we've got, that it's perfectly true, you do have to

This Court recently reaffirmed in Musick, Peeler

that it's the responsibility of the Federal courts to give

content to and round out the private right of action that

has been recognized under section 10(b) of the '34 act and

the Commission's implementing rule, 10b-5.

For the past 30 years, the lower Federal courts

2

have uniformly held that aiders and abettors are properly

3

named as defendants in suits under 10(b) and 10b-5.

4

are hundreds of such reported decisions in the lower

courts.

the enforcement of the Federal securities laws should not

First of all is the very practice that has gone

on for 30 years, a point the Court noted in Musick,

Peeler, that the experience of the lower Federal courts is

15

itself a factor to be taken into account, but turning to

16

the text of the securities laws themselves, section 10(b),

17

in statutory terms, is written very expansively, referring

18

to any person who directly or indirectly engages in the

19

conduct to which the section speaks, language that is

20

broad enough in itself to include aiders and abettors,

21

especially given the common law background, and we cite a

22

case of this Court going back to 1869 holding aiders and

23

abettors liable in common law fraud.

4
5

Did that case speak about the

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, this is just the existence of

aider and abettor liability on that case, Your Honor.
But beyond that, there are a number of other

6

7

important indicia in the securities laws themselves.

8

example -- well, not in the securities laws.

9

would start with 18 U.S.C section 2, which is significant

10

For

I think I

here.

11

It provides that an aider and abettor is liable

12

as a principal, and we think that is significant, that in

13

terms of giving content to the private right of action

14

under section 10(b), it is important to look to the

15

persons whom Congress has deemed to be responsible when a

16

violation of 10(b) occurs, and section 2 of title 18 makes

17

absolutely clear that Congress deemed a person who aids

18

and abets a violation of section 10(b) to be responsible.

19

QUESTION:

You think Congress when it enacted

20

section 2 of title 18, which applies to the whole criminal

21

code, really had this narrow problem in mind here?

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

No, my point is that as applied

23

to section 10(b), Congress has deemed and in fact held

24

criminally responsible persons who substantially

25

participate in a violation of section 10(b).

1

In other words, in terms of rounding out the

2

cause of action, it's not necessary to find that Congress

3

had a specific intent under -- in enacting title 18 with

4

respect to section 10(b).

5

Congress has deemed that a person who aids and assists any

6

violation of a law to be liable, and not only liable,

7

liable as a principal, who has substantially participated,

8

and therefore is equally culpable.

9

QUESTION:

My point is simply that

One can make the opposite argument

10

from Article 2, and that is that if it was a rounding out

11

matter, you wouldn't even have to have section 2, that it

12

would automatically go along.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

Well, no --

Congress felt the need to say, by the

15

way, aiders and abettors will be held the same as

16

principals.

17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, in the criminal law

18

context, you would of course need a statute to say who is

19

responsible, and the reason the Congress had adopted --

20

enacted section 2, as this Court said in Standefer, was

21

to, for example, overcome the common law rule that if the

22

principal is acquitted the aider and abettor could not be

23

found liable, and Congress wanted to eliminate that

24

artificial distinction.

25

After all, someone who substantially

-

1

participates in a violation of the law is quite culpable

2

in bringing about the injury in this case to the

3

plaintiff, so we think that section 2 is very important,

4

because it not only identifies whom Congress thought was

5

responsible, but also puts the person on notice that his

6

substantial participation in the fraud will give rise to

7

liability.

9

QUESTION:

Is it the position of the SEC that

there was sufficient evidence here to support a finding

10

that the petitioner substantially participated in the

11

circumstances of delaying the appraisal?

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yeah, we think there's -- yes.

13

We think there's sufficient evidence to avoid summary

14

judgment, that the case has been sent back to the district

court because of the agreement to postpone the appraisal.

2

May 13th, I think, of 1988.
The other - - the other places in the act where

3

Congress has identified that aiders and abettors should be

4

responsible and the Commission's longstanding ability to

5

get injunctions against aiders and abettors under section

6

21 also reinforce the idea that aiders and abettors are

7

responsible and therefore set the -- an appropriate

8

parameter for the private right of action.

9

Also, the statutory analogues that this Court

10

has looked to, particularly sections 9 and section 18 of

11

the act, far from supporting petitioner's position support

12

respondent's position in this case.

13

Section 9 imposes liability on anyone who

14

wilfully participates, and participates is an expansive

15

term, in fact the term that respondent elsewhere

16

identifies with aiding and abetting based on this Court's

17

decision in Nye and Nissen, someone who participates in

18

the transaction, so section 9 we think is clearly broad

19

enough to include aiding and abetting liability, and the

20

same with section 18, which refers to any person who makes

21

or causes to be made any misleading statement in a

22

registration statement.

23

And finally, the private right of action for

24

aiding and abetting is a very important supplement to the

25

SEC's own enforcement authority.

The SEC can go after

aiders and abettors just as it can go after primary-

2

violators, but just as in the case of primary violators,

3

the SEC is not in a position to uncover every bit of

4

wrongdoing and also is not in a position to compensate

5

victims.

Its role is the different one of deterring

violations by disgorging profits or enjoining future

violations.

That's why, just as in the case of primary

If I could move on to the recklessness standard,

all the courts that recklessness is an adequate showing in

Indeed, in this Court's decision in Cooper v.

19

without knowledge of its truth is a false statement

knowingly made, and when an aider and abettor

21

substantially participates in the making of a false

statement, then we believe that the same standard of

recklessness that applies to the primary violator should

apply to the aider and abettor, because after all, again,
