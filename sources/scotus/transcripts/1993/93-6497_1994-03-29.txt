ORAL ARGUMENT OF MANDY WELCH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. WELCH:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Frank McFarland asked the district court to

12

appoint him a lawyer and to stay his execution long enough

13

so that that lawyer could do what was proper and necessary

14

to prepare and file Mr. McFarland's first Federal habeas

15

corpus petition.

16

The respondents took the position --

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. WELCH:

1
20

When did he ask that, counsel?
He made the request on October 22nd,

Justice Scalia.
QUESTION:

That was how long after the petition

21

for certiorari had been denied from his original

22

conviction?

23
24
25

MS. WELCH:

It was denied June 6th, so it was

approximately 4 months, 4-1/2 months.
QUESTION:

Why did it take that long to worry

about the counsel problem?
MS. WELCH:

2

Well, I'm sure that Mr. McFarland

3

worried about the counsel problem the entire period of

4

time, Your Honor.

MS. WELCH:

Yes, sir, we worried a great deal

about it.

Did the Texas Resource Center worry

about it?

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

And what was it, 5 days before his

execution you came in with this motion?
MS. WELCH:

11

Yes, Your Honor.

We took the

12

position and have taken the position that we should do

13

everything we can in order to get counsel for

14

unrepresented death row inmates in Texas for State court

15

proceedings before we resort to the provisions in Federal

16

court.

17

QUESTION:

And you didn't see the problem

18

arising until 5 days before the execution, having already

19

gotten one extension of the execution, right?

20

MS. WELCH:

Your Honor, we did see the problem

21

arising, and we were worried about the problem.

22

worried about the problem with respect to approximately 65

23

people in Texas' --

1

At this time, Your Honor, we have

18, and there are 376 people on death row.

3

involved in at least 220 cases in which people are -- in

4

which those prisoners are seeking relief in any State and

scheduled to be executed in mid-September.

until 5 days before the extended execution date to come in

You had

with a request for counsel.

11

MS. WELCH:

No, Your Honor, we did not wait

12

until 5 days before.

We did not intend to wait until

13

5 days before the execution date.

14

was a request pending in State court and we were expecting

15

and hoping the State court would grant an extension, or

16

would grant a modification, and that going to Federal

17

court would be necessary.

There were so many easy ways to avoid

QUESTION:

What we are here

Counsel, I am circuit justice for the

5

Fifth Circuit, as you know, and the Texas Resource Center

comes in at the last minute regularly.

7

MS. WELCH:

Your Honor, we do come in at the

8

last minute if the last minute is -- if you're talking

9

about shortly before an execution date, but we try to come

10
11

in earlier.
In Mr. McFarland's case, the execution date was

12

set without notice to us.

13

Mr. McFarland wrote us and asked us to continue helping

14

him recruit a lawyer.

15

We learned about it when

When -- during the month of September, and

16

it's -- it may look to an outsider who is only thinking

17

about Frank McFarland's case as though we were sitting

18

around during July, August, and September, with

19

Mr. McFarland's agreement, waiting for an execution date

20

to be set so that we could put into play the circus that

21

goes on down there.

22

Honor. I assure you, that is not what we were doing.

23

That is not what we were doing, Your

In the month of September, the month in which

24

Mr. McFarland's execution date was set, there were 10

In August, there were -- I think there were six

cases.

picture.

12

experience.

13

Of those lawyers, five have less than 2 years

QUESTION:

Ms. Welch, don't waste anymore of

14

your argument time on this.

15

I am not happy with the performance of the Texas Resource

Center in the cases that come before me as circuit

justice.

I just want you to know that

Let's leave it at that.

18

MS.WELCH:

I understand, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Try harder.

20

MS. WELCH:

Respondent took the position in the

21

court below that the court did not have jurisdiction over

22

this matter because Frank McFarland had not yet filed a

23

legally sufficient habeas petition.

24

agreed and denied a stay.

1

Federal court may have authority to appoint counsel before

2

the filing of a petition under these circumstances, there

3

is an absolute jurisdictional bar that prevents that court

4

from keeping the prisoner alive.

5

QUESTION:

Ms. Welch, you said that the

6

petitioner here had not filed -- that the reason for the

7

court's denial was he had not filed a legally sufficient

8

habeas petition.

9

Federal court?

Had he filed any habeas petition in the

MS. WELCH:

10

No.

He had only filed a motion

11

requesting appointment of counsel, notifying the court

12

that he was a State prisoner under sentence of death, that

13

he did want to seek relief under 2254, and that he needed

14

a lawyer under -- that he needed a lawyer to prepare a

15

petition in order to seek that relief.

16

asked for the lawyer under --

QUESTION:

19

He specifically

Did he ask for a stay at the same

time?
MS. WELCH:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, he asked for

20

a stay in order to have a lawyer appointed, and so that

21

that lawyer could do what was necessary to file the

22

petition that was needed under the State's position to

23

invoke the court's jurisdiction.

24
25

QUESTION:

Just to clarify, when the district

court did finally obtain counsel for McFarland -- I think

1

that was on the very eve of execution -- then counsel did

2

file a pleading entitled, petition for writ of habeas

3

corpus, did he not?

4

MS. WELCH:

That's not -- I mean, the court did

5

not obtain counsel.

What happened is the counsel that --

6

Danny Burns was the lawyer that did end up filing a

7

petition.

8

had gotten a call from the Federal magistrate asking him

9

if he would accept an appointment in this case, and he was

He called us that afternoon and told us that he

11

decide whether or not he was in a position to accept an

12

appointment.
QUESTION:

13
14

he not?

15
16

But he then did file a petition, did

MS. WELCH:

He did.

He was never appointed, and

in fact he was never contacted by the judge.

17

QUESTION:

And the district court thereupon

18

denied the stay based upon the merits of an incomplete

19

petition, right?

20

MS. WELCH:

QUESTION:

And a divided panel then issued the

1

denial of the appointment of counsel and stay motion in

2

the first proceeding.

3

They were filed at the insistence of the court clerk, I

4

believe, in the Federal court, under two separate case

5

numbers, and there were two stays that were simultaneously

6

granted.

7

Those are two separate proceedings.

No one disputes -- no one before this Court

8

disputes that when Congress enacted 848 it intended to

9

authorize and require district courts to appoint counsel

10

to assist with the preparation and filing of a habeas

11

petition, and there is good reason why no one disputes

12

that, and in fact the respondent's amicus Criminal Justice

13

Legal Foundation explicitly adopts that interpretation of

14

848.

They know -QUESTION:

15
16

It isn't clear that the State agrees,

is it?

17

MS. WELCH:

You're right, Justice O'Connor, it's

18

not agreed that they concede it.

19

they have said, in the event, if the Court determines,

20

they have really not taken a position on it as far as I

21

can tell.

22

QUESTION:

They don't dispute it.

In any event, you take the position

23

that 848 does allow the appointment of counsel by the

24

court prior to the filing of a petition for habeas?

25

MS. WELCH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, we definitely

1

do, and as the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation's brief

2

indicates, they explicitly agree that 848 authorizes the

3

prepetition appointment of counsel, and in fact --

4

QUESTION:

It does have language of, in any post

5

conviction proceeding under 2254 or 2255 the appointment

6

can be made, but you think that doesn't limit it to --

7

MS. WELCH:

No, and in paragraph -- I can't find

8

it.

I thought I had it here, but in paragraph (8) under

9

that provision, the court indicates that counsel appointed

10

in accordance with those provisions shall do whatever is

11

necessary, including six stays of execution, and it refers

12

to the post conviction process, and it uses language that

13

suggests that counsel is intended to be available at all

14

critical stages.

15

QUESTION:

And the district court in the Fifth

16

Circuit in this case, what is the position, now, on that

17

point, the appointment of counsel?

18

MS. WELCH:

They did not -- the Fifth Circuit

19

did not specifically address the right to counsel, but the

20

district court specifically refused to appoint counsel,

21

apparently relying upon the jurisdictional bar that

22

respondents urge.

23

QUESTION:

Would it be simpler to take the

24

position that a proceeding does require the filing of a

25

petition, but that in order to give effect to the

1

statutory counsel guarantee, it would be an abuse of

2

discretion to act on the pro forma petition before the

3

appointed lawyer has had time to investigate and to amend,

4

if the lawyer sees fit?

5

MS. WELCH:

I think that that would just -- yes,

6

Justice Souter, I think that would certainly address the

7

problem that Frank McFarland was faced with and that is

8

being presented to the Court, but only if it is clear to

9

the inmate that an insufficient petition does not invoke

10

the court's jurisdiction and insofar as it requires the

11

Barefoot standard to be met.

12

QUESTION:

That's right.

Of course, I suppose

13

the answer to Barefoot is that the statutory provisions

14

for appointment of counsel have come after Barefoot, and

15

Barefoot should be at least narrowed at least not to

16

frustrate the counsel guarantee.

17

MS. WELCH:

Yes, Justice Souter, but in addition

18

to that, I think it is important to note that Barefoot

19

paid a lot of attention to the fact that in that case he

20

had had competent counsel throughout the proceedings, and

21

to some extent both the Fifth Circuit and this Court

22

relied upon that in approving the standards that have

23

since become the --

24

QUESTION:

25

No, I realize that.

Maybe I'm not

getting the point, but it seems to me that the enactment

1

of the statutory guarantees for counsel in both the State

2

and the federally derived habeas proceedings reflects in

3

effect a congressional judgment that there ought to be

4

more counsel, i.e., that there ought to be a guarantee of

5

counsel at the habeas stage in the Federal court, and I

6

don't suppose that we could in effect honor that guarantee

7

that Congress has chosen to provide if Barefoot were not

8

narrowed to a degree in order to allow counsel time to do
what counsel is supposed to be there to do.
MS. WELCH:

10

I absolutely agree with you, Justice

11

Souter.

12

where someone files a piece of paper asking for counsel

13

and attempts to prepare what would be considered a

14

petition, but the court might find that it's not a

15

petition, and in those circumstances I think that the All

16

Writs Act would provide a habeas court with the necessary

17

authority to issue a stay to protect its jurisdiction

18

over --

1

I do think that there could be circumstances

QUESTION:

What jurisdiction?

Jurisdiction over

20

what?

I mean, it seems to me no matter how liberally you

21

interpret the requirement, despite Barefoot, the provision

22

for counsel only applies to someone who is seeking habeas

23

corpus, and it seems to me that you need some assertion of

24

an error in the State court, not simply an assertion, I

25

don't know whether there's an error or not, appoint a

lawyer for me to see if there was one.

2

not what Congress said.

That's certainly

Congress said, if there's an error that you're

3
4

claiming, you're entitled to a lawyer to prosecute it, but

5

don't you need some assertion of an error, at least?
MS. WELCH:

6

Yes, Your Honor, but Congress also

7

recognized that in order for a death row inmate to

8

articulate an error sufficiently to benefit from habeas

9

corpus review, a lawyer is necessary.
QUESTION:

10

To help him prosecute his claim of

11

error, but he has to have a claim of error.

12

saying anybody, whether he has a claim of error or not, is

13

entitled to get a lawyer to see if he might have a claim

14

of error.

15

It's not

That's not what Congress said.
MS. WELCH:

Your Honor, I do think that that is

16

what Congress said, that a lawyer is required in order to

17

assist a death row inmate in identifying those claims

18

which must be reviewed by habeas corpus in order to

19

provide an effective remedy for people who are sentenced

20

to death in violation of the Constitution.

21

QUESTION:

Well, of course, the further question

22

is the authority to issue a stay, and turning your

23

attention to Justice Souter's suggestion that a skeletal

24

petition be filed, is that consistent with Rule 4 of the

25

habeas rules, which requires that a petition be dismissed

1

unless it appears on its face that there's a probability

2

of relief?
MS. WELCH:

3

I think that it could conflict with

4

Rule 4 if Rule 4 is construed as an absolute, automatic

5

bar to proceeding, but that is not what Rule 4 is, nor

6

what it was intended.

7

discretion under some circumstances to do that, I think

8

that 848 makes it clear that it would be an abuse of that

9

discretion, as Justice Souter indicated, if that were done

10

While the court might have

in a case -- in a death case without counsel.
QUESTION:

11

So if it plainly appears from the

12

facts of the petition that he's not entitled to relief,

13

nevertheless it would be an abuse of discretion to dismiss

14

it in a death case.
MS. WELCH:

15

Your Honor, I think that it would be

16

an abuse of discretion to determine from that pleading

17

whether or not someone is clearly entitled, or clearly not

18

entitled.
QUESTION:

19

Or would you say that you could not

20

determine from the pleading whether or not he is clearly

21

entitled?

22

MS. WELCH:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that the

23

rule should be that the court is not committed to

24

determine from an uncounseled petition that --

death cases, because that's the only time in which counsel

2

are appointed under the statute, or would you extend this

3

rule to any habeas petition in Federal courts?

4

MS. WELCH:

5

QUESTION:

6

7

No.

I would --

The Federal court is sort of a filing

cabinet until the petition is fleshed out?
MS. WELCH:

No, Your Honor.

I think that when

8

Congress passed 848 it make an absolute determination that

9

counsel is required in every capital case.

It has not

10

made that determination with regard to other habeas

11

provisions.

12

That would have to be addressed --

QUESTION:

Yes, but you're interpreting Rule 4

13

saying it's an abuse of discretion to dismiss until

14

counsel has been obtained.

15

MS. WELCH:

16

expressed by Congress in 848.

17

provisions that are within the discretion of the court

18

when the interests appear to require appointment of

19

counsel under the Criminal Justice Act, but I think that

20

what Congress did in 848 is enact an unrebuttable

21

presumption that the interests of justice requires the

22

appointment of counsel in all capital cases.

23

QUESTION:

But that is because of the intent

the petition will be drawn pro se by the prisoner, so that

proceeding, but you are entitled to counsel to draw your

MS. WELCH:

Ginsburg, that's --

13

QUESTION:

15

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Justice

Why do you do that?

That's a very

roundabout way to say that.
I mean, it would be very easy for Congress to

16

say, anyone who desires to file a habeas petition is

17

entitled to a lawyer for that purpose.

18
19
20

It did not say that.

It said, in any post

conviction proceeding.
MS. WELCH:

Yes, but if you take into account

21

the need for a lawyer, and the difference between the

22

right to a lawyer, the discretionary right to a lawyer

23

under 3006A and that mandatory right to a lawyer under

24

848, it makes no sense to create a situation where a pro

QUESTION:

That

Ms. Welch, your opponents say that

6

the Pennsylvania case, or our case of Pennsylvania Bureau

7

of Corrections v. U.S. Marshall's, militates against your

8

contention that the All Writs Act is available to you.

9

What is your response to that?
MS. WELCH:

10
11

That case involved issuing of -- is

it issuing of subpoenas?

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. WELCH:

Anyway --

Subpoenas ad testificandum, yes.
Right.

That -- in that case, there

14

was a specific statute that dealt with the specific thing

15

that was before the court.

16
17

QUESTION:

In this case --

Isn't there a specific statute

dealing with stays --

18

MS. WELCH:

There is a specific statute dealing

19

with stays, and if you interpret it as we do, it gives the

20

court jurisdiction when a request for counsel is filed.
If you interpret it as the State does and limit

21
22

its application to that period of time after a petition is

23

filed, then there is nothing -- it is void.

24

void.

25

2

and so you have a totally different situation.
QUESTION:

Well, you know, if you're reading

3

things into section 848 simply because fairness or logic

4

requires it, why do you have to read into it that a stay

5

of execution would be available?

6

It seems to me the most you would read into it

7

is that if he comes in soon enough to request counsel,

8

counsel will be given an opportunity to draw a habeas

9

petition, and if that petition has merit, then a stay can

10

be issued, but if you come in 5 days before the execution

11

with no claim at all and ask for counsel, should you be

12

able to get a stay?

13

MS. WELCH:

You've had 180 days.
Your Honor, the question before this

14

Court is whether or not the Court has jurisdiction to stay

15

an execution --

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. WELCH:

To stay.
-- when it's necessary in order to

18

appoint counsel and protect its habeas review over claims

19

that are then presented in a counsel petition.

20

QUESTION:

And what I'm suggesting is that your

21

necessity argument that 848 must operate even before a

22

meritorious habeas petition has been filed, that argument

23

only carries you to the point where you have to allow them

24

to file it within a reasonable time before a stay of

requires Federal courts to stay the process of State

justice.

3

MS. WELCH:

I don't agree with you, Justice

4

Scalia, and I don't think that it's necessary to read the

5

stay provisions into 848.
The stay provisions are within the All Writs

6

7

Act, which authorizes the Federal habeas court to issue a

8

writ or other orders when it is necessary to protect its

9

prospective jurisdiction over a State conviction and death

10
11

sentence.
QUESTION:

But its jurisdiction comes from 848,

12

and if 848 only guarantees that you get counsel if you

13

apply in a timely fashion and not when you decide 5 days

14

before your execution that there may be something wrong,

15

although you can't really state anything wrong.

16

MS. WELCH:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

Your Honor -We have to go back to 848, it seems

to me, whether you use the All Writs Act or not.
MS. WELCH:

There may be circumstances where a

20

death row inmate so abuses the process and so toys with

21

the court and so ignores available processes that it would

22

not be an abuse of discretion to deny a stay or to deny

23

counsel, but those issues are not before this Court.

MS. WELCH:

2

It's -- because of the uncertainty

3

about the provisions, Your Honor, it is really difficult

4

for me to say.

QUESTION:

6

We had always approached the right to -Can you look back and say there is

some time after which this request could have been made?

7

MS. WELCH:

After the State court refused to

8

appoint counsel, or after this, and also refused to allow

9

additional time for other measures to be taken that might

10

have provided counsel.

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. WELCH:

When was that?
That was October 22nd, when the

13

Court of Criminal Appeals denied our request to order the

14

State court to appoint counsel.

15

QUESTION:

And you say no, it would not have

16

been possible to have asked for counsel before that date

17

under 848?

18

MS. WELCH:

Well, that was the position that we

19

had taken that we should pursue all available State

20

remedies for counsel.

21

QUESTION:

Excuse me, you didn't ask the court

22

to appoint counsel until October 22nd.

modified the date so that we could come back before the

That judge took the position that Texas law did

not authorize him to appoint counsel, and we -- and so we

were trying to persuade that judge to give us enough time

to recruit volunteer counsel, but that judge said

explicitly to me over the telephone, with the district

even allowing me to appoint counsel, so I'm not going to

do it.

QUESTION:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARGARET P. GRIFFEY

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

3
4

MS. GRIFFEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court.

5

McFarland asks the Court to disregard the plain

6

meaning of 2251 and amend the express limitations enacted

7

by Congress in order to allow a stay of execution to be

8

entered whenever a death sentence inmate approaches the

9

Federal court claiming to be without the assistance of

10

counsel.
In asking the Court to validate his

11
12

misconstruction of statutory authority, McFarland seeks to

13

effectively overturn the limitations of constitutional

14

review recognized in McCleskey v. Zant, and to indirectly

15

overturn the limitations of Coleman, Giarrantano, and

16

Finley.

17

McFarland complains that the ruling of the court

18

below effectively foreclosed Federal habeas review because

19

under the Fifth Circuit's analysis a petitioner is unable

20

to obtain a stay, an appointment of counsel, without first

21

filing an application, but is unable to file an

22

application without first obtaining the assistance of

23

counsel in a stay.

10

MS. GRIFFEY:

11

QUESTION:

12

MS. GRIFFEY:

One did.

Yes.
The amicus of the Criminal Justice

13

Legal Foundation took the position that counsel could be

appointed beforehand.

15

QUESTION:

However, it is clear -Of course, normally, you would expect

16

if the habeas petition were going to be prepared properly

17

that some advance preparation might be required by counsel

18

and possibly investigators.

19

MS. GRIFFEY:

That is not what Congress provided

20

for.

There is a specific provision, 848(q)(4)(B), that

21

refers to a habeas proceeding, or a post conviction

22

proceeding under 2254.

The general provisions contained in subsection

or there would have been no need for that specific

QUESTION:

Do you think that if the petitioner,

prisoner himself, files the habeas petition and then

8

requests counsel, that it is within the discretion of the
Court to dismiss the habeas petition based on a review of

10

just what the prisoner has put, or does a court properly

11

exercise its discretion by refusing to dismiss the

12

petition until the attorney has looked at it?

13

MS. GRIFFEY:

I think that is entirely within

14

the court's discretion.

15

discretion is the basis upon -- whether a State --

What is not within the court's

You do not think it would be an abuse

17

MS. GRIFFEY:

I think if there is a petition

relief, then under 848(q), that petitioner is entitled to

the appointment of counsel, but he may not be entitled to

Is it your position that this statute

6

QUESTION:

If it's incidental to the proceeding,

then it's part of the proceeding?
You're hesitating because if you say yes, then

7

the proceeding begins, and he is entitled to counsel

8

before the habeas petition is filed, and it seems to me
perfectly plausible that Congress intended to expand the

10

proceedings under 2254 by including that phase in which

11

counsel is appointed under 848.

12

MS. GRIFFEY:

If Congress intended to do that,

13

they did not do that, and it is a well-established rule of

14

statutory construction that the court will not provide

15

what Congress intended to do but presumably by one theory

16

or another omitted by inadvertence.

17

QUESTION:

But isn't it equally incumbent on us

18

to construe our procedural rules in such a way that it

1

does not turn congressional statutes into dead letters,

20

and if we continue to construe the procedural requirements

habeas petition, once filed, may, without any abuse of

discretion, be finally adjudicated before counsel has had

procedural requirements in a way that avoids that?

The only way that 848(q) is turned

Oh, with respect, I don't

13

seems to me that on your argument that is true if the

petitioner comes in on the very first possible day,

because the petitioner comes to the court and says, I want

MS. GRIFFEY:

1

Yes, I am saying that.

I'm saying

2

that 848(q) right to counsel is conditioned upon a 2254,

3

or actually a habeas corpus proceeding is defined by title

4

28, chapter 153, and all the statutory provisions therein,

5

all of which uniformly require a petition or an

6

application to be pending, and incidentally, none of which

7

address any prepetitioner application stay of the

8

proceeding.

9

QUESTION:

Is it right that this Gosch case,

10

that applies without regard to the time of the petition?

11

That is, if the petition is inadequate, it can be

12

dismissed and that's the end of it?

13

I take that that's what this case holds.

The

14

district court can look at the hand-drawn petition, say

good, and then, as Justice Souter said, where is there

17

room for counsel in that picture?

MS. GRIFFEY:

Yes, that can happen, but

underlying all this concern is the assumption that Federal

habeas review is somehow indispensable to the State's

not.

May I ask a factual question?

In the

7

first part of the blue brief there's a description of the

Is that an accurate statement

QUESTION:

That's correct.

But that all changed after the Gosch

case.

4

MS. GRIFFEY:

That changed -- that was not the

5

procedure that was followed in Gosch.

6

that has all changed.

7

and most of the courts are continuing to act in that

8

manner, of allowing time to file amended petitions and

9

that sort of thing, and I also would like to point out -QUESTION:

10

I can't say that

It is still our office's position,

But wasn't -- McFarland's situation

11

was that if Gosch was going to apply in his case, and he

12

filed just this rudimentary petition, he was at grave risk

13

of having it thrown out, because it would not have been a

14

well-pleaded complaint, and then not being able to come

15

with a counseled petition?

16

MS. GRIFFEY:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

That --

Wasn't he -- that was a real risk for

him.
MS. GRIFFEY:

That was his risk in Federal

20

court, but underlying McFarland's claims here is the

21

assumption that somehow the procedure fell down in the

22

first instance in the Texas courts because Texas does not

23

routinely and regularly with a uniform procedure provide

24

for the appointment of counsel.

25

QUESTION:

That had to do with the timing of it.

It could be at the earliest possible moment the

contemplated, that the prisoner himself must write a

decent enough petition -- not a pro forma petition of the

12

kind that went on before Gosch, but a really good

petition.

14

MS. GRIFFEY:

Habeas jurisdiction is conditioned

upon there being errors of constitutional dimension

you making an argument for unreasonable delay as opposed

arguing.

QUESTION:

It just seems extraordinary that you

are complaining about the few months that lapsed here and
said that that was no occasion for a stay, and yet in the
State's own process it took over 3 years to get from the
conviction to the affirmance on appeal.
MS. GRIFFEY:

It has been my experience in

watching a number of capital cases go through that.

That

period of time is not unusual on direct appeal, nor is
that period of time at all unusual for a case to be
pending before a Federal district court.

The issue here

is how to make the petitioner proceed in an orderly
fashion from one stage of litigation to another.
Sometimes these cases raise complex issues that
require extended review.

The period of time in between

should not be one that is simply used to sit there and
say, I don't have counsel.

It should be used for the

preparation of a petition, and Texas tried to provide for
the regular, routine appointment of counsel and for the -a series of filing dates that did not require execution
dates to be set, and that provision was defeated by the
very people who are now lobbying, or the very people who
are now representing McFarland in this Court, and by the
lobbying of some of the groups who have appeared as amicus
in this case.

Let me ask another question about

he files a perfunctory petition that is dismissed as

that that second petition was an abuse of the writ?

15

MS. GRIFFEY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. GRIFFEY:

Yes.

It would.
The understanding that a habeas

18

application is commenced by the filing of an application

19

or petition raising constitutional bases for relief is

20

consistent with the Court's conclusion in Barefoot v.

Estelle that a stay can only be entered if there is a

1

it is consistent with the legislative history of the

2

habeas corpus statutes.
In 1908, Congress attempted to eliminate the

3
4

delay in the carrying out of State executions attributable

5

to frivolous appeals by enacting the CPC requirement, and

6

in 1934, Congress eliminated the provision for automatic

stays.

of Mitchum v. Foster.

cannot be avoided, is in the first instance the petitioner

himself file an adequate petition, uncounseled?

MS. GRIFFEY:

QUESTION:

That is correct.

That's what has to happen.

He has to

23

draw the petition.

He cannot have a lawyer, unless he can

the nub of your argument -- that to get your foot in the

3

MS. GRIFFEY:

The critical point of my argument

is that he's not entitled to a stay while he finds

counsel.

He must have a constitutional basis for relief.
QUESTION:

Yes, but that -- but the

constitutional basis would be coming in with an adequate

district attorney, just like the Attorney General's

The

He made it quite clear that he would not appoint

counsel to represent Mr. McFarland on that petition, and

when it was explained to him that we could not, unless we

had additional time, he made it quite clear that we would

21

not be allowed to substitute counsel even if volunteer
