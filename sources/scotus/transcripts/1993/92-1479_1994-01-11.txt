ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARDEN J. LEA

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LEA:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, Justices of this

honorable Court, may it please the Court:
Petitioner McDermott, Incorporated, is here

11
12

today to obtain relief from the double penalty placed upon

13

it by the Fifth Circuit, which left in place a trial

14

judge's reduction of its judgment, pursuant to the

15

proportionate fault rule; which, at the same time, it

16

rejected and, then, from that reduced amount, compounded

17

injustice by further deducting from the judgment the full

18

dollar amount of a settlement with another codefendant --

19

to the detriment, obviously, of the injured plaintiff,

20

McDermott.

21

Encapsulated in these facts, which, on their

22

own, would require reversal, is a disputed issue of

23

admiralty law requiring resolution by this Court --

24

namely, which rule on settlement contribution should be

25

adopted by the Court:

the proportionate fault rule or the

pro tanto rule?
Interestingly, all parties agree that three

3

fundamental principles surrounding the resolution of this

4

issue -- which are, initially, all agree that the

5

principle of joint and several liability is, and should

6

continue to be, the rule of this Court.

7

All agree that liability among co-tort phases is

8

and should continue to be determined proportionately at

9

trial and, also, in any contribution action.

10

All agree that settlement should be encouraged,

11

but not at the expense of the two preceding principles;

12

nor at the expense of needlessly altering the rights of

13

the parties to the remain -- of the non-settling defendant

14

in the proceeding at trial that will later follow.

15

The disputed issue before the Court is whether

16

the adoption of the proportionate or the dollar-for-dollar

17

settlement -- so-called tanto -- pro-tanto contribution

18

rule -- will best effectuate these fundamental principles

19

mentioned above, and which should be incorporated by this

20

Court into admiralty law.

21

The Court today has to accommodate its

22

historical favoring of settlement of claims entered into

23

by the injured plaintiff, and the need to protect the

24

rights of the non-settling defendant, who is not a party

25

to the settlement agreement.

McDermott urges this Court to hold that the

proportionate settlement contribution rule is the fairest

and, thus, the best.

destiny with regard to its claim.

The plaintiff is permitted, under

He can choose, with

He, by settling, accepts both the benefits and
the detriment of the contract, as is the case with respect
to any contract.
On the other hand, most importantly, the

12

non-settle -- settling defendant's contribution rights

13

remain unaltered because, at trial, they will be decided

14

proportionately.

15

Now, there are certain alleged perceived

16

benefits to the adoption of the pro tanto rule.

17

McDermott suggests to this Court that in all --

QUESTION:

But

Mr. Lea, you -- you refer to the --

19

the rule your espousing, I believe, you're referring to it

20

as the proportionate fault rule?

21

MR. LEA:

Proportionate fault rule, yes, sir,

22

Your Honor.

Which was basically the rule of comparative

23

fault that was outlined by this Court by its adoption of

24

that in non-collision cases in reliance transfer, and

25

which has been the rule of this case with regard to

1

personal injury since the country has existed.
The alleged benefits of the pro tanto, or the

2

3

dollar-for-dollar credit, usually advanced to justify its

4

adoption, can -- are usually couched in terms of:

5

ensures full compensation to the plaintiff; it's easy to

6

apply; the dollar-for-dollar credit satisfies the one

7

satisfaction rule; and that it avoids potentially

8

confusing or unnatural realignments of the parties at

9

trial.

It

McDermott contends that these benefits are

10
11

merely perceived and, when examined carefully, do not

12

result in the benefits advocated by proponents of the pro

13

tanto rule:

14

plaintiff.

15

initially, full compensation to the

If you really think about that, that presupposes

liability on the non-settling defendant.

17

would be no full compensation to the plaintiff.

18

Otherwise, there

It also wrongfully equates, as the Leger opinion

19

pointed out, settlement dollars were judgment dollars.

20

And the way they are determined -- or the amount is

21

determined that is fair -- are subject to completely

22

different rules -- one are personal concerns of the

23

parties to the settlement.

employees by the time necessarily consumed in defending

1

any -- or prosecuting any trial.

Another thing that would

2

be considered would be litigation expenses, which, as

3

everyone is quite aware, are costly these days.

4

The judgment dollars are merely what the trier

5

of fact, be it a judge or a jury, think, after a hearing

6

of the evidence, the case is worth --no more, no less.

7

This Court has favored, in recent years, the

8

settlement of cases without resort to extra judicial means

9

-- with its favoring of the arbitration proceedings, for

10
11

instance.
We see no reason why private, out-of-court

12

settlements that do not affect the rights of anyone other

13

than the parties to the agreement, as occurs in the

14

proportionate method that we advocate, should really be of

15

concern to the Court, other than to encourage the fact

16

that they be entered into.

17

QUESTION:

There's no --

But what -- what about, counsel, the

18

unseemliness of, if you go with the proportionate fault

19

way, the settling defendant determining that defendant's

20

portion of the liability when that -- that person is a

21

nonparty to the litigation.

22

MR. LEA:

Your Honor, that's precisely what does

23

not happen in the proportionate method, because, in the

24

proportionate method that we're advocating, what happens

25

is that the jury, in the trial of the non-settling

defendant, is charged to render a verdict relating only to

2

the percentage of fault that the defendant decides -- who

3

decides to go to trial contributed to the ultimate -QUESTION:

4

But would -- wouldn't necessarily the

5

jury have to determine if it's proportioning the fault,

6

what is the respective fault of the settling defendant and

7

the non-settling defendant?

8

MR. LEA:

9

Honor.

Yes, ma'am, it would.

It would, Your

And there is nothing really wrong with that,

10

though, because if you really think about it, the -- if --

11

if you looked at it in -- in the practical matter of how a

12

case is tried, really, all the books written on it, there

13

are only -- almost all defendants -- and I'm usually one

14

myself -- come with the same thing:

15

accident didn't happen or the damages weren't incurred by

16

the plaintiff.

17

fault of a third party, either a party before the court,

18

one that can't -- the court can't exercise jurisdiction

19

over, or the fault of the plaintiff.

I don't often have that benefit, Your

Honor.
Now, with regard to ease of application and
judicial economy, I think this Court clearly, in Reliable

Transfer, held that if this is to be sacrificed -- if --

11

if equity is to be sacrificed to achieve this, that this

12

Court will not tolerate it.

13

QUESTION:

And it --

Well, well, but Justice Ginsburg is

14

-- is correct, is she not, that each -- each of the rules

15

we're going to be discussing has certain disadvantages?

16

And one disadvantage of the proportionate fault rule, as

17

you call it, or pro rata allocation, is that a party may

18

settle for too much or too little, and that the total

19

dollars are not allocated in accordance with the ultimate

20

jury verdict.

symmetry of the scheme, is it not?

I mean, that is a - a - a flaw in the

MR. LEA:

QUESTION:

Is it practicable or does it ever

2

occur that a settling defendant would say, I'll assume

3

that I am responsible for 10 percent, and -- and the --

4

the settling plaintiff will accept that, but then they

leave a -- a certain amount to be deducted or added,

6

depending on the jury's verdict, say, within the range of

7

another $50,000?

8

10

MR. LEA:

It is not that common.

I think what

you are referring to would be very closely akin to what's
referred to commonly as a Mary Carter agreement.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. LEA:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. LEA:

As -- as a what?
A Mary Carter agreement, so named -Yes, yes.
In my experience, that is not common.

15

And, if it is, most trial judges, as with any evidentiary

16

matter, usually hold that that is relevant information

17

that should be put before the jury in order to any -- to

18

end any faults or hidden misalignment of parties.

19

QUESTION:

But it still is possible to enter

20

into such an agreement, and -- and thereby, by contract,

21

reduce the concerns -- what one party or both parties have

22

about receiving too much and too little?

23

the contract option is open?

MR. LEA:

It is.

In other words,

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

Yes.

they do that or whether they don't, they are -- they're

2

still adjusting their rights and liabilities by agreement,

3

and nobody has to weep if they get it wrong -- they're --

4

they're both over 21?
MR. LEA:

5

As in any contract, Your Honor.

I

6

don't know why a settlement contract, absent fraud or

7

misrepresentation, should be treated under the law by this

8

Court any different than any other contract.
QUESTION:

9

No, it's not unfair to the -- to the

10

plaintiff or to the settling defendant, but -- but is

11

there not -- and it seems to me this the problem -- the

12

non-settling defendant is hauled into court in order to

13

pay the plaintiff, by the power of Government, more --

14

more than the plaintiff has actually suffered.
The plaintiff has now gotten a settlement --

15
16

let's assume both the defendants are 50 percent liable,

17

and let's assume the settling defendant pays what amounts

18

to 75 percent of the -- of the actual harm suffered.

19

Nonetheless, the State is going to make the non-settling

20

defendant pay a full 50 percent -- 25 percent more than

21

the -- than the plaintiff is really entitled to.
The plaintiff walks away with a 25 percent

23

windfall.

It's not unfair to the settling defendant.

He

MR. LEA:

2

No, sir.

We wouldn't agree with that.

3

And the reason why is that we don't think that the

4

non-settling defendant has standing to challenge a

5

contract that does not affect him.

6

happens at the ultimate trial, that defendant will only

7

have to pay the amount that the trier of fact, albeit

8

judge or jury, finds that he, in right, should pay.

Because no matter what

Another thing that it does is it deters the

9
10

non-settling defendant's conduct.

11

and why should he be allowed to challenge a contract when

12

it doesn't affect him?

13

the person that really should complain would be the

14

settling defendant, but he was satisfied with the

15

contract, or otherwise he wouldn't have entered into it.

16

QUESTION:

And -- and -- and --

And if the plaintiff gets more,

Is this case unusual in that respect,

17

that the settling defendant paid more than what turned out

18

to be the proportionate share?

19

settling defendant pays less?
MR. LEA:

20

Isn't more common that the

I would say, in my experience, that

21

usually a plaintiff will discount in exchange for a

22

certainty of recovery in acceptance of a settlement of a

23

lesser amount than he would anticipate getting at trial.

2

earlier.

3

to do is pay the amount that the jury determines he

4

rightfully owes after a full trial on the merits.

5

And all we're asking the non-settling defendant

The problem with the pro tanto method, I would

6

like to suggest to you, is we think it borders on being

7

seriously -- having serious constitutional infirmities,

8

because, otherwise, under that system, you are taking a

9

defendant's right to have contribution decided on a

10
11

proportional basis, which we're advocating here.
And, as a corollary to this, we see no reason to

12

have one rule at trial and another rule at settlement.

13

You are taking his constitutional right -- or his right to

14

have a full trial on his right of contribution by --

15

against another defendant, and you are letting parties, by

16

private agreement, to which he is not a part, set those

17

rights, with either no right of contribution or, under the

18

so-called fairness hearing -- which we think is a

19

misnomer, because there is nothing fair about substituting

20

a hearing against a nonparticipating defendant for his

21

right to trial -- which is oftentimes to be held before a

22

jury, as was in this case -- and have it determined by

23

private agreement and foisted on him in the name of

24

fairness -- because this really is not fair to anyone.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM K. KELLEY

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. KELLEY:

7
8

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In this case, which arises under the general

9
10

maritime law, the Court has the task of arriving at what

11

it considers the best rule under the circumstances,

12

without the backdrop of any statutory provisions or

13

policies to turn to for guidance.

14

the position of the United States is that the proportional

15

reduction, or pro rata rule, is the appropriate one to

16

adopt.

17
18

And, in this context,

That rule is fair because it leads to all the
parties in the lawsuit -QUESTION:

19

Now, Mr. Kelley, we've heard that, I

20

believe, described as pro -- pro -- proportionate fault

21

rule.

And what you're advocating is the same thing.
MR. KELLEY:

22

In substance, it is, Mr. Chief

23

Justice.

In our brief we've used the term pro rata,

24

which, perhaps, was imprecise.

25

QUESTION:

And that is as opposed to pro tanto?

MR. KELLEY:

Yes.

The commentators view it -- view there -- there
as being three different options:
and a proportional reduction.

a pro tanto, a pro rata

The pure pro rata approach,

which allocates the settlement based on simply the number
of people in the lawsuit, is not favored by anyone.

So

our brief probably should have used the term proportional
reduction instead.

But, in any event, the substance in

the same.
And the substance of that rule is -- is one that
leaves the burdens of a party's decision to settle or not
to settle a case on that party.
fair.

We think it's, therefore,

It's also efficient because it obviates the need

for any collateral litigation, whether in the form of
contribution or a fairness hearing.
Now, the primary objection to the proportional
reduction rule made by respondents in the Court of
Appeals, and Justice Scalia this morning, is that it
threatens to violate the so-called one recovery rule:

a

tort plaintiff is entitled only to recover the amount of
damages determined by the jury, and no more.

And the pro

tanto rule does assure that that will be the case.
But we think that objection is without any merit
for the following reasons:
First, it wrongfully equates settlement dollars

with judgment dollars.

2

matter, it seems to us, that a plaintiff and a defendant,

3

when considering whether to settle, will consider a

4

variety of factors, not necessarily exclusively the value

5

of the claim if it goes to trial, in determining whether

6

to settle, and the appropriate amount at which to settle.

7

Those factors include the cost -QUESTION:

8

It's quite clear as an economic

When -- when you say, we cannot

9

equate judgment and settlement dollars, what you're really

10

saying is that the -- the parties place their own value on

11

them.

12

saying, it's their agreement and therefore no one has

13

cause to complain if he happens, ultimately, to end up on

14

the short end of it?

Isn't -- isn't that another way of, in effect,

MR. KELLEY:

15

I -- I agree with that, Justice

16

Souter.

The point is that, for example, in this case, the

17

sling defendants made a $1 million settlement, which turns

18

out, in retrospect, to appear to have been a bad bargain

19

for them.

20

was so, because they could have considered a variety of

21

factors, in addition to the value of the claim if it goes

22

to trial, in deciding what amount to pay, including the

23

cost of litigating and the -- the -- not only the economic

24

costs, in terms of legal fees, et cetera, but also the

25

distraction to the company.

But we don't know, prior to trial, whether that

So it might well have been very worthwhile for

1

2

them to pay more than they might have lost at judgment.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Kelley, what's wrong with the

4

solution that Justice Scalia referred to earlier, that one

5

thing they shouldn't have is that the plaintiff gets over

6

100 percent recovery, so that when the settlement is --

7

turns out to be too high, that the non-settling defendant

8

should not have to pay more than what would be enough to

9

give the plaintiff a hundred percent of what the jury

10

finds to be the total damages?

11

MR. KELLEY:

We think that argument is -- is

12

incorrect, Justice Ginsburg, because what it does is it

13

requires the plaintiff to transfer the benefit of his good

14

settlement bargain to the non-settling defendant.

15

that results in nothing but a windfall to that defendant

16

-- as happened in this case under the Court of Appeals'

17

opinion.

18

in this case, because the settlement that he received was

19

not part of the judgment.

And

The plaintiff has not achieved a double recovery

20

It is true that the jury -- the jury's

21

determination of damages turned out to make it appear that

22

way, but prior to the -- prior to trial, the plaintiff

23

took a risk that the settlement would be a bad deal for

24

the plaintiff.

25

that bargain.

And we don't see any basis for undoing

Well, the -- the basis is, if he had

6

And if you got more than you were entitled to, well, it's

7

8

it seems to me, you come in saying, I have been injured in

9

a certain amount.

10
11

You

You didn't ask the court for anything.

But when you come into court,

And that's a lie if in fact you've

gotten 80 percent of it back in a settlement beforehand.
The amount of your injury at that point is only

12

20 percent.

-- not to enable people to trade -- trade speculations

14

about what a jury is going to say.

15

And the courts are here to do justice, not to

MR. KELLEY:

Justice Scalia, I disagree.

And

16

the reason is -- is this.

17

-- excuse me -- that the plaintiff received before trial

18

did not represent his injury.

19

represent his injury, but it also represented additional

20

economic considerations made by both the plaintiff and the

21

defendant who settled with him.

22

The 20 percent -- or 80 percent

In part, it surely did

And it seems to us that the rule you're

23

suggesting -- it's not only unfair to the plaintiff, but

24

it's inefficient in terms of the way the tort system

25

should operate.

Because what it does is it rewards a

In

There's no -- there should be no disincentive to

We think that is --

to settle, we think that is an illegitimate coercion.

The

2

Court recognized as much in the Reliable Transfer, where

3

it said that a rule that merely encourages settlements is

4

no rule at all if it is unfair.
So, we -- we believe that it's -- it's hard to

say for certain in the abstract which rule would -- would

7

encourage settlements to a greater degree, but we don't

8

believe there's any basis for saying the rule we advocate

9

would discourage settlements at all.
QUESTION:

10

Is there any rule like the one that

11

Justice Scalia suggested -- and outlining -- and all the

briefs outlined the three different positions that courts

take -- and the position that you're advocating is

essentially you don't look at the settlement, the

MR. KELLEY:

Well, a -- a couple of States --

3

Texas, I believe, and perhaps New York -- have adopted

4

systems that give the non-settling -- that defendant the

5

option of choosing which system he wants.

6

is -- would needlessly complicate litigation.

7

we believe also that it -- it unduly and unfairly gives

8

the non-settling defendant the option to -- to minimize

9

his own out-of-pocket payments in a manner than is

The rule we're advocating is one that treats

benefits of that deal.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Why is it inefficient in terms of the

tort system?
MR. KELLEY:

Because what it does, Justice

18

Ginsburg, is it makes a defendant's liability payment to a

19

plaintiff depend on a factor other than its level of care

20

in -- in the maritime marketplace.

this Court's cases, that rules of tort liability should be

Thank you, Mr. Kelley.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. COUHIG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

The goal in any damage claim in admiralty should

petitioners that there are three fundamental principles

6

that this Court and the law keeps in mind:

First, the promotion of full recovery by an

injured plaintiff should be, and has been, consistently

9

followed through.

20

Secondly, the encouragement of settlements.

21

And, third, the equitable sharing of losses.

22

Let me state at the outset that any system

23

adopted hard and fast, whether it's pro tanto, pro rata or

24

proportional, carries with it some problem.

25

while in this case -- this case was tried as a pro tanto

And so that,

1

case -- and the record, I believe, reflects that -- that

2

is, when the settlement was made on the morning of trial,

3

and -- and the settlement was announced that the sling

4

defendants had paid a million dollars in settlement, we

5

announced that we would take the Hernandez credit.

6

And I am going to ultimately suggest that this

7

Court has within its power the ability now to set a rule

8

that will give guidance to all parties and meet the

9

discussion and the -- and the questions and the concerns

10

that have been raised this morning.
The problems, obviously, don't exist if the case

11
12

goes to trial against several multiple defendants.

13

Defendant A is found 30 percent at fault; defendant B is

14

70 percent at fault; there's a million dollars worth of

15

damage.

16

If defendant B can only pay half of that amount,

17

this Court would still find -- I believe the law

18

recognizes -- that defendant A would have to come up with

19

the rest, regardless of its proportionate fault finding.

20

And I would suggest that if we go off on a proportionate

21

fault basis today, that we may place that in jeopardy.

22

On the other hand, if the case goes to trial

23

against only one of those two defendants, it is a fiction

24

to suggest that on the morning of trial, when a settlement

11

parties -- two sets of parties with the same interest to

12

get the evidence in.
MR. COUHIG:

13
*\

Well, why isn't it?

Justice Souter, what happens in an

14

instant like that is that the plaintiff who, up until now,

15

had been attempting to prove fault on both A and B, at

16

that moment, becomes the defender of -- of defendant A.
QUESTION:

17

Oh, that's true.

The plaintiff agreed.
MR. COUHIG:

It also puts the non-settling

3

QUESTION:

Well, I mean, is that realistic?

4

Sure, he's concerned with his own responsibility, but he

wants to make sure that the fact-finder thinks that most

of that responsibility, whatever it may -- or most of the

7

responsibility -- rested on the head of another defendant.

His -- his -- his interest doesn't change.

MR. COUHIG:

stage of selecting the method, and if it's in a

jurisdiction that allows recovery, as in the Boca Grande

case, to follow from the settling defendant, then I would

think that the defendant who settled would have no way of

5

knowing whether the deal was going to stand or not stand,

6

as it was.

7

MR. COUHIG:

Your Honor, let me suggest that

8

there are two possible cures to that.

Generally, in a

9

settlement, the settling defendant will place in the

10

settlement document an indemnity provision.

11

contractually, even if -- and -- and I don't want to get

12

into the facts of the other case with not -- out knowing

13

more precision -- but, even if there was a claim against

14

them, the indemnity provision that would run in favor of

15

the plaintiff would, in effect, be a bar to that recovery.

16

They would get a credit for it, or whatever.

17

So that,

This proposal doesn't even need to get to that

18

point, because, as part of it, there'd be no need for a

19

contribution claim because the non-settling defendant

20

would have been a party, in effect, to the settlement.

21

would have been able to evaluate what was appropriate

under the circumstances.

equitable sharing of the losses through a proportional

regardless.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Couhig, why -- why do we -- I --

3

I guess I don't understand your -- your -- the King

4

Solomon approach that you've offered us here.

5

that one of the advantages of that -- you know, putting

6

the choice upon the non-settling defendant -- is that you

7

don't have a good faith hearing.

8

MR. COUHIG:

QUESTION:

10

MR. COUHIG:

QUESTION:

that.

13

goes the other way.

That's correct.
There isn't any good faith hearing.
There's no good faith hearing.
And that -- that's the advantage of

He -- he looks at it.

14

MR. COUHIG:

15

QUESTION:

I thought

If it looks bad faith, he

That's correct.
But even in your suggestion -- the

16

same amount of trial -- when you put in the case against

17

the settling defendant, to -- to enlarge that percent --

18

his percentage of liability, one of the advantages is the

19

settling defendant won't care, so he won't resist that

20

case.

21

phase of the case.

22

So your case is a little easier on that -- that

MR. COUHIG:

That's -- it sounds so, sir, except

23

that, at that point, the plaintiff, just as he does now

24

under a pro rata system, if we were to try it under --

25

steps forward and, in effect, defends him.

But the actual

1

party, you are correct, has no longer a vested interest in

the outcome.
QUESTION:

3

Another complication, it seems to me,

4

is that some of these settlements are not just simply for

5

dollars.

6

possibly have been accompanied by agreement for the next

7

five years we'll buy our slings from your company, or

8

something like that, too.

9

Like in this case, the million dollars might

MR. COUHIG:

Yes, sir.

10

QUESTION:

11

measure the dollars sometimes.

12

Which makes it kind of hard to

MR. COUHIG:

There -- there are difficulties

13

with measurement, but I think those can be overcome

14

through -- through the use of either experts or in-house

15

people, and they can be quantified, sir.

16

QUESTION:

I -- I'm not sure how to evaluate

17

your argument that an in -- insolvency would skew the

18

symmetry of the scheme under the pro rata -- or

19

proportionate fault theory.

20

insolvent, then I assume the -- the settlement is void.

21

And if -- if the defendant who is insolvent is -- is a

22

non-settling defendant, then it doesn't make any

23

difference.

MR. COUHIG:
out the question, sir.

1

QUESTION:

I had thought you said that the risks

2

of an insolvency on the part -- of a judgment-proof

3

defendant were a reason for adopting your rule.

4

I don't understand why that should be.

5

MR. COUHIG:

And I --

If, for example, under the pro

6

tanto regime, the dollar-for-dollar regime, the -- the

7

court of the law's principle purpose of allowing full

8

recovery is satisfied -- because if there is an insolvent

9

defendant, just as one can do, you -- you would go against

10

the other defendant that would not -- that would have a

11

contribution right, but without real remedy, but the

12

plaintiff could receive his full recovery.

13

Under the system of choosing among the parties,

14

and after the plaintiff and a settling defendant choose --

15

it would allow the non-settling defendant to choose --

16

that non-settling defendant would be aware of the economic

17

circumstances.

18

the -- the defendant who was settling had relatively few

19

funds, was, in effect, going to either go out of business

20

or had gone out of business, or the litigation was driving

21

them out of business and they wanted to put up some

22

dollars -- before they did that, the plaintiff would look

23

at it and say, what is this going to do, and, what is this

24

going to create with the non-settling defendant?

25

And -- and let me suggest if, for example,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ARDEN J. LEA

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. LEA:

May it please the Court:

9

I would like to address the question that I see

10

-- that seems to be of interest -- most interest to the

11

Court, and that is, is the plaintiff purportedly getting a

12

windfall?

13

First, I would like to point out that in this

14

case, we did not get a windfall, because the sling

15

defendants had exposure in $4.5 million worth of damages

16

that were dismissed in exchange for their million-dollar

17

settlement, as well as this case.

18

We could have pursued with no East River bar the

19

claim against them for the damage to the Shearleg crane.

20

Next of all, I want to suggest to the Court that there are

21

oftentimes, because we love the law, because we are in it

22

every day, tend to view the law as we would view a child,

23

but we have to realize that the law, no more than our

24

children, are perfect.

25

windfall presupposes that the true value or worth of a

case is that set by the judicial system, the trier of

fact, be it judge or jury, and that the private parties to

detail, are incapable of placing an accurate or a
